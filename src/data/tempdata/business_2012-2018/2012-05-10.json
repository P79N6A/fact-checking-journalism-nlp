First, the winnings that flow from the threefold improvement in cash generation since 2009 and a similar recovery in share price from 70p to 213p. Chief executive Ian Livingston will collect shares worth \u00a34.5m next week when his 2009 incentive scheme vests, and, all being well, can look forward to a slightly smaller payout in a year's time from the 2010 scheme. About 1,000 of Livingston's management underlings will enjoy their own jackpots via the same schemes. And 20,000 staff in the UK will bank an average profit of \u00a38,500 via save-as-you-earn schemes; another 25,000 are in the money to the same degree on five-year plans that finish in 2014. BT will spend \u00a3300m of its shareholders' cash on shares to fund that little lot. But investors are unlikely to complain given the shambolic state of the company when Livingston was promoted in 2008. His rescue formula \u2013 stop the nosebleed in the global services division (which runs big IT contracts), slash costs (30,000 jobs have gone), concentrate on service rather than deal-making and make peace with the pension fund trustees \u2013 has paid off. BT has turned into a cash-gusher. The pension fund was thrown \u00a32bn last year and now it's the turn of shareholders \u2013 the dividend is being hiked 12% with a promise of 10%-15% increases in each of the next three years. BT would require a further two years of increases to restore the dividend to its former height but that would still count as impressive speed. BT would apply the same description to its installation of fibre for superfast broadband in the UK. \"Our rollout is one of the fastest in the world,\" claims Livingston. That boast, one suspects, is also a plea for gentler regulation on wholesale pricing for the old copper network. And you can't blame him for reminding government that it dodged a bullet when BT, still critical to the functioning of UK economy, saved itself from a pension-induced catastrophe. (Albeit, it should be said, with large assistance from a switch from RPI to CPI-based calculation of liabilities.) The missing ingredient to the recovery story is growth \u2013 revenues fell 2% last year and previous hopes for improvement this year are being reined in. You can't buck the slow economy, seems to be the explanation. That may be why the share price fell 2.5% today. It makes Livingston's 2.13m shares next week worth \u00a3120,000 less \u2013 but, in the grand scheme, that's nothing.",

    "webTitle": "Spain races to shore up troubled banks", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Measures to overhaul Spain's ailing banking system are expected to be announced on Friday as the government races to shore up confidence in the economy and head off fears that it will need an international bailout to remain in the eurozone. The emergency measures taken to partly nationalise the country's fourth largest bank, Bankia, on Wednesday are not regarded as enough to encourage investors to start pouring their money back into the country. Antonio Garcia Pascual, chief economist for southern Europe at Barclays, said that in the past six months there had been large outflows of funds from Spain and that this needed to be tackled. \"If foreign investors continue to reduce their exposure to Spain at an economically disruptive rate, the country will require external financial support to manage this adjustment\", he said. Some \u20ac16bn (\u00a313bn) of public sector funds are already being used to prop up Spain's banks and Pascual believes another \u20ac50bn will be needed this year and next as banks recognise losses on a wave of property loans. The need for intervention comes four years after the UK was bailing out its banks, laden with toxic sub-prime debt. At the time Spaniards were told they had the world's best central bank \u2013 one that had banned Spanish banks from buying dubious US mortgage derivatives. But the scramble to rescue Bankia has shed light on Spain's own version of toxic debt \u2013 the vast amount of money loaned to builders, developers and land speculators during a decade-long property boom. Comparisons are being made with Ireland, where a property boom and bust crippled its three largest banks and led to a bailout of the country, but Pascual believes the comparisons are exaggerated. \"None of the large three banks in Spain have needed any public money, unlike in Ireland. In the UK the exposure of the banks to construction and developers, it's about 10% of bank assets. In Spain it's 20% and in Ireland it's over 30%. Ireland had to be bailed out, Spain is under intense market scrutiny, and the UK did not escape unscathed,\" he said. It is now clear that Spain's bubble was imploding even as it was being praised for its handling of the 2008 crisis. The slowdown in construction was already lengthening the dole queues and between 500,000 and 900,000 unsold new homes were on the market. By the end of 2008, it was apparent that Spain's biggest financial risk lay in the close relationship between local savings banks, the politicians who controlled them and the property developers who paid handsome local taxes. At that stage, with much building land illiquid, there were clear signs of coming disaster. Some 430,000 new homes had been built in the first eight months of 2008 alone \u2013 one for every 100 Spaniards. Rather than own up to losses, Spanish banks chose to roll over loans or allow developers to finish building so that they could take properties instead. Many then left their portfolios of apartment blocks, housing estates and land unsold while giving them unrealistic book values that hid the scale of the problem. \"The bailout should have been done four years ago, as the UK did in 2008,\" said Eduardo Mart\u00ednez-Abascal of Spain's IESE business school. \"Less money would have been needed and the confidence generated could have boosted growth.\" The new government, headed by conservative prime minister Mariano Rajoy, has put pressure on the banks to own up to the scale of their toxic property loans. Bankia \u2013 a 17-month-old conglomeration of seven regional savings banks from areas mostly run by Rajoy's People's party \u2013 floated in July and most shares were sold to ordinary Spaniards, who were told this was the \"best of the new banks\" and who now face large losses. Rather than gaining strength through size, Bankia became a sick giant with nearly \u20ac32bn of problem real-estate assets at the end of 2011. The \u20ac4.5bn in government loans given to Bankia over the past two years \u2013 which, the government announced on Wednesday, will be turned into shares to give the state 45% of the equity \u2013 is expected to be only the tip of the iceberg. The bill for Bankia alone could reach \u20ac15bn.",

      "bodyText": "And still they revolt. Actually, Pendragon would probably have copped a hefty protest vote on pay even in the depths of the shareholder winter. This is a company that borrowed heavily to spend \u00a3500m at the top of the market in 2006 to buy rival Reg Vardy, saw its share price fall 90% and last year hit shareholders for a nine-for-eight rights issue in which one third of the shares were left with the underwriters. Goodwill towards the car salesmen was always going to be in short supply. The trigger for a 67% vote against the pay report was both the short- and long-term incentive proposals. The former were seen as too generous and the latter as too undemanding.

But he may now feel, as Stephen Fry so sagaciously chuckles in the Visit England campaign ads, \"it's just not worth it\". On Thursday the culture department's intervention \u2013 a spring TV campaign featuring Fry and other celebrities with the punchline \"No passports. No jabs. No visas. No euros\" \u2013 was attacked by the head of Thomas Cook as \"absolutely wrong\" in persuading Britons not to bother travelling abroad. The chief executive of Thomas Cook's UK business, Ian Ailles, said that the economic contribution of the outbound tourism sector matched that of the inbound sector, making a huge contribution to GDP as well as to the Treasury's coffers. Speaking at a conference of the travel association Abta, he said: \"What we ask is that the government doesn't distort a functioning market with microeconomic meddling.\" Abta unveiled figures on Thursday showing that outbound travel contributes more than \u00a322bn directly to the economy and keeps 620,000 people in full-time work. A report by the Centre for Economics and Business Research also claimed that an additional \u00a331bn of economic activity in the UK could be credited to related pre-trip spending on items such as holiday wardrobes and sun cream. Mark Tanzer, Abta's chief executive, said it proved the huge contribution of foreign travel to economic success. He said: \"For too long it has been assumed that by going abroad on holiday, money is being taken out of the UK economy. The government must recognise and support outbound travel in its current and future policies to deliver growth to the wider economy.\" Ailles also attacked the \"stealth holiday tax\" of air passenger duty for dampening demand, adding that despite repeated assurances that the government supports travel and tourism, \"the tax only increases\". He added: \"I believe the chancellor would rather take the plaudits for lower direct taxation while stealing it in extra indirect taxation, which we take for him.\" The duty, which has united much of the aviation and travel industries in protest, rose by 8% last month. Tanzer said that the industry would be looking to \"mobilise customers\" to protest against it, and that the point needed to be made that it affected consumers' own budgets and not just the industry's.",

    "webTitle": "Shareholder spring continues as car dealer Pendragon's pay report is voted down", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The shareholder spring continued to blossom on Thursday when the remuneration report of car dealership Pendragon was voted down \u2013 the third to be rejected by shareholders this year \u2013 and media group Trinity Mirror scraped through a protest vote over pay. In a sign that there is no let-up in the current wave of shareholder activism, other companies endured revolts on Thursday, including media group Mecom and gaming company Sportech. The focus will now turn to Centrica, the owner of British Gas, which is preparing for a rebellion at its annual meeting on Friday, and then materials science company Cookson and online gambling group 888, which hold annual meetings next week. Advisory body Pirc has recommended voting against every member of the Cookson board and the Association of British Insurers (ABI), whose members represent a significant group of institutional investors, has issued a \"red-top\" alert \u2013 which warns members of serious concerns \u2013 at Cookson and 888. Pendragon had also been the subject of an ABI alert to investors, while Pirc had recommended voting against the pay deals. That helped trigger the hefty defeat of the remuneration report: 67% of Pendragon investors voted against, causing the firm to withdraw its attempts to increase the potential bonus for directors from 100% of their salaries to 150%. At Trinity Mirror \u2013 where chief executive Sly Bailey had already become a victim of the shareholder spring after resigning last week \u2013 46% of investors voted against the remuneration report while the level of protest rose to 54% if deliberate abstentions were included. Almost a quarter of shareholders voted against the publisher's long-term incentive plan, and Jane Lighting, the former chief executive of Channel 5, who heads the remuneration committee, failed to win the backing of one in five of shareholders. Just under 15% of investors failed to back Bailey, whose \u00a314m pay deals over 10 years have infuriated investors amid a slump in the company's market value from more than \u00a31bn to \u00a380m. The backlash came despite her promise to leave by the end of the year. Pendragon's remuneration report is the third to be voted down this year. The small gold-exploration company Central Rand Gold suffered a 75% revolt against its pay policy last month while insurance company Aviva had its report voted down last week, sparking the resignation of chief executive Andrew Moss on Tuesday. Pendragon's chairman Mike Davies, who endured an investor rebellion against his re-election to the board when 25% of shareholders voted against him, told the annual meeting there would now be consultation over pay. \"I would like, on behalf of the board, to take this opportunity to reassure all shareholders that we have taken their objections about short-term and long-term incentive plans seriously,\" Davies said. He promised a \"full review of all remuneration policies\". Pirc has warned that Centrica's new executive pay scheme means \"potentially excessive amounts could be awarded\" while the ABI has also flagged up the deals for shareholders attending the annual meeting at the Queen Elizabeth II conference centre in London on Friday. Centrica has been criticised for allowing its chief executive, Sam Laidlaw, to take home almost \u00a34m in 2011 despite flat company earnings. Greenpeace has called for Laidlaw to hand back his bonus and other anti-nuclear protestors said they would demonstrate outside Centrica's meeting over its plans to build a new generation of reactors. The company argues the altered remuneration policy will benefit investors as it introduces a clawback mechanism for taking back deferred bonuses under certain circumstances. The new scheme also introduces a wider list of criteria \u2013 not just financial results \u2013 that must be met for senior executives to win their bonuses. Chairman Sir Roger Carr is expected to stress that the headline figure for Laidlaw's remuneration package has been boosted by a series of payouts from various long-term incentive schemes. He will also point out that the chief executive's basic pay of \u00a31.2m has been frozen for 2012 \u2013 as has the \u00a3681,000 salary of British Gas managing director Phil Bentley. It is expected that up to 15% of shareholders will vote against the pay plan. Despite a clamour from protesters \u2013 and some parts of the City \u2013 for Centrica to abandon its plans to build new nuclear plants in cooperation with EDF of France, there is likely to be no pullout announced on Friday. Lawrence Carter of Greenpeace said: \"Laidlaw should hand back his bonus. And it's high time for him to bring energy bills under control by dropping increased imports of expensive and polluting gas and instead backing clean, renewable energy and energy efficiency.\"",

The small gold-exploration company <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/apr/30/website-public-anger-city-pay\" title=\"\">Central Rand Gold </a>suffered a 75% revolt against its pay policy last month while insurance company Aviva had its report voted down last week, <a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">sparking the resignation of chief executive Andrew Moss</a> on Tuesday.</p> <p>Pendragon's chairman Mike Davies, who endured an investor rebellion against his re-election to the board when 25% of shareholders voted against him, told the annual meeting there would now be consultation over pay.</p> <p>\"I would like, on behalf of the board, to take this opportunity to reassure all shareholders that we have taken their objections about short-term and long-term incentive plans seriously,\" Davies said. He promised a \"full review of all remuneration policies\".</p> <p>Pirc has warned that Centrica's new executive pay scheme means \"potentially excessive amounts could be awarded\" while the ABI has also flagged up the deals for shareholders attending the annual meeting at the Queen Elizabeth II conference centre in London on Friday.</p> <p>Centrica has been criticised for allowing its chief executive, Sam Laidlaw, to take home almost \u00a34m in 2011 despite flat company earnings. Greenpeace has called for Laidlaw to hand back his bonus and other anti-nuclear protestors said they would demonstrate outside Centrica's meeting over its plans to build a new generation of reactors.</p> <p>The company argues the altered remuneration policy will benefit investors as it introduces a clawback mechanism for taking back deferred bonuses under certain circumstances. The new scheme also introduces a wider list of criteria \u2013 not just financial results \u2013 that must be met for senior executives to win their bonuses.</p> <p>Chairman Sir Roger Carr is expected to stress that the headline figure for Laidlaw's remuneration package has been boosted by a series of payouts from various long-term incentive schemes. He will also point out that the chief executive's basic pay of \u00a31.2m has been frozen for 2012 \u2013 as has the \u00a3681,000 salary of British Gas managing director Phil Bentley.</p> <p>It is expected that up to 15% of shareholders will vote against the pay plan. Despite a clamour from protesters \u2013 and some parts of the City \u2013 for Centrica to abandon its plans to build new nuclear plants in cooperation with EDF of France, there is likely to be no pullout announced on Friday.</p> <p>Lawrence Carter of Greenpeace said: \"Laidlaw should hand back his bonus. And it's high time for him to bring energy bills under control by dropping increased imports of expensive and polluting gas and instead backing clean, renewable energy and energy efficiency.\"</p>",

The group has reached its target of taking fibre from telephone exchanges to thousands of street cabinets from Bristol to Brixton comfortably ahead of its end-of-2012 deadline. Ian Livingston, the chief executive, said: \"Rolling out fibre is no easy task and so to have passed 10m premises in such a short time is fantastic. Our roll-out is one of the fastest in the world and our engineers deserve lots of credit.\" As the top 1,000 BT managers prepare to share a \u00a390m stock windfall pegged to rising cashflows, with Livingston in line to collect shares worth \u00a35m, the group beat forecasts to report a 3% increase in underlying full year earnings to \u00a36bn and raised the dividend to shareholders by 12%. Adjusted revenues in the year to 31 March were down 4% to \u00a319.31bn, slightly below the \u00a319.33bn forecast. The adjustment included a \u00a3410m charge from a regulatory ruling in Germany. Livingston said the target of more than \u00a36bn for pre-tax earnings had been reached a year early. Underlying revenues would show an improving trend in 2013 and 2014. The consumer division, BT Retail, signed up 589,000 UK broadband subscribers in the year to 31 March, against 702,000 at BSkyB, with both companies poaching customers from rivals including Virgin Media. In the last quarter, 131,000 signed up for the BT Infinity fibre-to-the-cabinet product, which offers speeds of up to 76mbps and is being priced on a par with the fastest copper lines, meaning BT now has more than half a million fibre customers. From 2013, the group plans to run fibre direct from telephone exchanges to premises across its existing fibre footprint. An all-fibre line would allow speeds of up to 300mbps, with a future potential for 1 gigabit per second. The product will cost about \u00a31,000 a line for installation, appealing to businesses but putting it out of reach of most householders. The final dividend was increased 14% to 5.7p. Having agreed a payment plan in March to cover its \u00a33.9bn pension deficit, BT announced more cash for shareholders, with a 10%-15% per year increase in dividends for the next three years. \"BT provides a level of stability and security that has so far been utterly absent in the rest of the telecom sector,\" said Robin Bienenstock, financial analyst at Bernstein Research. \"The company and its shareholders have been handsomely rewarded for that.\" Revenues at BT Openreach,which builds and operates the BT Group network, rose 4% to \u00a35.1bn, while operating profit rose 8% to \u00a31.36bn. Capital expenditure decreased 5%, because the investment in fibre was offset by lower spending on copper broadband. Losses narrowed at BT Global Services, the division that builds networks for corporate clients, from \u00a3141m to \u00a385m. Contracts worth \u00a32bn were signed in the fourth quarter, with customers including Anglo American and Nato. Revenue at BT Retail was down 4% in the year, with consumer revenues down 2%, the lowest decline in two years thanks to growth in broadband and BT Vision, the pay-TV service, which added 28,000 customers in the quarter, bringing its total to 700,000.",
