      "bodyText": "The economy has regained the pace of growth inherited by the government when it came to office in 2010, according to a leading economics institute. The National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) said GDP growth hit 0.9% in the three months to the end of August, up from 0.7% in the three months to July. The last time the economy was expanding at this rate, the coalition had announced its first budget and was about to impose a five-year austerity programme. The NIESR, which produces its own estimate of GDP ahead of official figures, said the economy was still 2.7% smaller than in 2008 and warned that the current turnaround in Britain's fortunes would wane slightly as the world economy slowed towards the end of the year. \"Looking ahead, the rate of growth will likely soften, somewhat, over coming quarters,\" it said. \"The external environment in the guise of weak demand from the euro area and slowing emerging markets will likely limit the rate of the UK's economic expansion.\" A slowdown in foreign markets played a part in Britain's worse than expected trade deficit in July, though manufacturing made gains in line with improvements in Britain's domestic performance. Official figures showed that factory output increased for the second consecutive month in July, up 0.2% on June. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the recent spurt of activity was largely due to a turnaround in machinery and steel production, but was not enough to offset falls dating back to last year when the government's austerity policies were hitting consumer confidence and the euro crisis was at its height. Since last June, industrial production has tumbled 1.6% over the last year. A decline in the production of steel and other metals dragged the manufacturing sector down by 0.7%, adding to falls in North Sea oil output that have hit the broader figures for several years. The recent rise in manufacturing has been welcomed by George Osborne as a sign that his economic policies are bearing fruit. But he is likely to be dismayed by trade figures from the ONS showing that the UK's recent growth has pulled in a record volume of imports and more than doubled the trade deficit to \u00a33.1bn. Imports rose to \u00a3104.2bn in the three months to July, a 3.1% increase, while exports to the EU remained flat and the trade in goods to countries outside the bloc fell sharply. David Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce, said the figures showed manufacturers still faced a challenge to recover from the financial crash, despite what he called a respectable increase of 0.9% compared with the previous three months. \"Longer-term comparisons highlight the challenges facing manufacturing. Output is still some 10% below its pre-recession level, and export markets for UK manufacturers may be volatile in the months ahead. Nevertheless, many manufacturing firms have demonstrated resilience during the recession, and many have successfully moved into new markets.\" Rob Wood, UK economist at Berenberg Bank, said it was clear from the manufacturing figures that the UK consumer was driving demand. Most of the rise in sales has been domestic, rather than through exports in recent months. He said: \"The trade figures were disappointing, with the trade deficit widening to its highest since October last year as exports fell sharply. \"The total deficit was \u00a33.1bn, well above consensus expectations of \u00a31.7bn. As with industrial production, the trade data are extremely volatile. A substantial part of the 16% fall in goods export volumes to the non-EU this month will almost certainly be reversed in August. Meanwhile, figures from the Bank of England show that it appears to be winning consumers round to its view that inflation is falling and interest rates will stay low for at least three years, according to its survey. A poll of consumers by GfK/NOP for the Bank found that consumers believed the current rate of inflation was lower than in the spring and was set to fall at a faster pace than they previously expected. Consumers said inflation was 4% compared with their answer in May, which was 4.5%. While the new figure is still much higher than the official CPI measure of inflation, which last month was 2.8%, the fall will be welcomed inside Threadneedle Street. Asked about their expectation of inflation in 12 months' time, respondents replied that it would be 3% compared with the 3.3% they said in May. Attitudes to the future path of interest rates have also eased. Surveyed only days after governor Mark Carney issued \"forward guidance\" outlining how interest rates will stay low for the next three years, 29% of respondents expected a rise in interest rates over the next 12 months compared with 34% in May. Carney wants consumers to base their spending decisions on his prediction that base rates will stay at 0.5% until 2016. He said last month that the economy needed to generate an extra 750,000 jobs before a re-examination of the central bank's interest rate policy. He said a surge in new jobs to bring the unemployment rate down to 7% would be a strong indication of the economy's renewed health. The Bank said: \"The survey began in 1999 and there have only been three occasions when fewer respondents expected interest rates to rise \u2013 February and May 2001 and November 2008.\"",

    "webTitle": "Dangerous days for Mark Carney", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Mark Carney should have seen this problem coming. If you start by giving the market guidance on the likely path of interest rates, investors will want a running commentary. If you then decline to defend your position, silence will be interpreted \u2013 or perhaps over-interpreted \u2013 as weakness. Two months into the job, the governor of Bank of England finds himself in a pickle. The bond market appears convinced the splendid run of economic data over the summer is the real deal. That's why the yield on 10-year gilts has risen from 1.6% to 2.9% since the start of May. The market is saying the UK economy is finally out of the emergency room and the Bank's monetary policy committee (MPC) will be bounced by events into raising interest rates much sooner than 2016. This could happen either because the economic data will become hotter, causing unemployment to fall rapidly, or because inflation will become a danger, thus triggering one of the MPC's so-called \"knockout\" clauses. But that's not Carney's view. He thinks the \"fledgling\" recovery is likely to require the fertilizer of ultra-low interest rates for three more years. Indeed, he has stated that rates will not necessarily rise even when unemployment falls to 7%, which the Bank expects to happen in 2016. This is not some idle academic debate. This stuff matters because the real rate of interest in the economy \u2013 as dictated by gilt prices \u2013 is almost as important as the Bank rate set by the MPC. That's why the governor last month called market movements \"unwarranted.\" But he was speaking when the 10-year yield was 2.4%. Now it's half a percentage point higher. If Carney and the MPC really are convinced the recovery is fragile, surely they have to try to stop the bond market's heavy boots trampling on the green shoots. But what's a governor supposed to do? There are no easy answers. One option would be to inject more quantitative easing, thus demonstrating determination to stick to the ultra-loose path. But that would be highly risky. Investors might conclude the Bank was taking risks with inflation. Yields might then go even higher, making Carney's problem more acute. Another answer would be to keep the market guessing and sound confident. We've had a taste of that already. Carney argued in Nottingham the other week that Bank rate determines 70% of borrowing rates. But this route is also problematic. What if yields continued to march upwards, say towards 4%? The MPC might look feeble if it did nothing. Worse, if Carney's fears were later realised and the recovery petered out, the Bank would stand accused of having done too little to combat a danger it itself identified. All of which is to say that setting monetary policy is hard, and becoming harder. For the past four years, the setting has been obvious: keep it loose, or make it even looser. But the summer's run of strong numbers and surveys from the manufacturing, construction and services sectors raises the stakes. A mistake now could have dire consequences. The UK doesn't need another artificial house price boom, which is plainly occurring in parts of London; but a relapse for the whole economy would be a tragedy, especially for jobseekers. One has to conclude that the policy of giving forward guidance on interest rates \u2013 the Carney innovation \u2013 is not helping matters. The desire to give consumers and businesses confidence that they will not be whacked by higher borrowing costs was understandable. But a fight with the gilt market, which is still programmed to take its cue from the US bond prices, would create a different type of uncertainty. Most consumers do not obsess over gilt yields \u2013 but businesses leaders making investment decisions certainly do care about the credibility of UK monetary policy. The reality may be that forward guidance is a useful weapon when you're running the US Federal Reserve \u2013 after all, investors still hang on Ben Bernanke's every word. But, for central bankers elsewhere, it may just create new headaches. These are dangerous days for Carney. And, if he is right in thinking the bond market is being irrationally exuberant, for the recovery too. Has Marc Bolland finally cracked it? Marks &amp; Spencer's share price touched 500p on Friday for the first time since January 2008. The City, having been infuriated for two years by perpetual promises of better times around the next corner, thinks it smells substance. Bolland has certainly had a stroke of good fortune in the form of the whoosh of improving consumer confidence. M&amp;S's revamped autumn/winter ranges, on which he has staked his reputation by bringing in new management, can't fail to sell better than last year's collections. The buzz in the fashion press, notes the City, is also much improved. \"M&amp;S could enter a cycle of rising margins and improving return on capital via a return to positive general merchandise life-for-like sales growth,\" reckon the enthusiastic analysts at HSBC. Well, yes, it could. On the other hand, it would be unwise to place too much trust in a few glowing reviews for the handiwork of Belinda Earl, the new fashion chief. The fashion press, and the views of M&amp;S shoppers, have collided many times in the past. Putting on a good catwalk show in London is not same as making the clothes look attractive in an under-invested store hundreds of miles away from Marble Arch. Meanwhile, the huge sums invested in M&amp;S's distribution and logistics in the past few years still have to earn a return. M&amp;S is still half a decade behind the likes of Next in online retailing. Good luck to Bolland, whose strategy for M&amp;S has always seemed broadly correct - and the food division, his main problem on arrival in 2010, goes from strength to strength. But M&amp;S has always been about the clothing product. Investors rarely get rich by waiting to see the proof of a turnaround; the money is made by getting in ahead of events. Even so, the City is investing an awful lot of faith in a single season's ranges. We can't allow Terry Duddy of Home Retail Group to depart without reminding him, one last time, of his spectacularly awful share buyback programme. The Argos and Homebase group spent \u00a3150m, half the company's cash pile at the time, on buying back shares at an average of 233p between April 2010 and March 2011. By May 2012, the share price had fallen by two-thirds and Home Retail couldn't even afford to pay its shareholders a final dividend. Duddy can retire in the knowledge that his \"multi-channel\" revamp of Argos is a success. The chain is less profitable than in the old days but it now looks fit to fight with Amazon. Even now, though, the group's share price has only recovered to 156p. The buyback (for which Oliver Stocken, former chairman, also deserves a dishonourable mention) was a shockingly poor use of shareholders' funds. What was wrong with a plain-vanilla special dividend?",

      "body": "<p>Mark Carney should have seen this problem coming. If you start by giving the market guidance on the likely path of interest rates, investors will want a running commentary. If you then decline to defend your position, silence will be interpreted \u2013 or perhaps over-interpreted \u2013 as weakness.</p> <p>Two months into the job, the governor of Bank of England finds himself in a pickle. The bond market appears convinced the splendid run of economic data over the summer is the real deal. That's why the yield on 10-year gilts has risen from 1.6% to 2.9% since the start of May. The market is saying the UK economy is finally out of the emergency room and the Bank's monetary policy committee (MPC) will be bounced by events into raising interest rates much sooner than 2016. This could happen either because the economic data will become hotter, causing unemployment to fall rapidly, or because inflation will become a danger, thus triggering one of the MPC's so-called \"knockout\" clauses.</p> <p>But that's not Carney's view. He thinks the \"fledgling\" recovery is likely to require the fertilizer of ultra-low interest rates for three more years. Indeed, he has stated that rates will not necessarily rise even when unemployment falls to 7%, which the Bank expects to happen in 2016.</p> <p>This is not some idle academic debate. This stuff matters because the real rate of interest in the economy \u2013 as dictated by gilt prices \u2013 is almost as important as the Bank rate set by the MPC. That's why the governor last month called market movements \"unwarranted.\" But he was speaking when the 10-year yield was 2.4%. Now it's half a percentage point higher. If Carney and the MPC really are convinced the recovery is fragile, surely they have to try to stop the bond market's heavy boots trampling on the green shoots.</p> <p>But what's a governor supposed to do? There are no easy answers. One option would be to inject more quantitative easing, thus demonstrating determination to stick to the ultra-loose path. But that would be highly risky. Investors might conclude the Bank was taking risks with inflation. Yields might then go even higher, making Carney's problem more acute.</p> <p>Another answer would be to keep the market guessing and sound confident. We've had a taste of that already. Carney argued in Nottingham the other week that Bank rate determines 70% of borrowing rates. But this route is also problematic. What if yields continued to march upwards, say towards 4%? The MPC might look feeble if it did nothing. Worse, if Carney's fears were later realised and the recovery petered out, the Bank would stand accused of having done too little to combat a danger it itself identified.</p> <p>All of which is to say that setting monetary policy is hard, and becoming harder. For the past four years, the setting has been obvious: keep it loose, or make it even looser. But the summer's run of strong numbers and surveys from the manufacturing, construction and services sectors raises the stakes. A mistake now could have dire consequences. The UK doesn't need another artificial house price boom, which is plainly occurring in parts of London; but a relapse for the whole economy would be a tragedy, especially for jobseekers.</p> <p>One has to conclude that the policy of giving forward guidance on interest rates \u2013 the Carney innovation \u2013 is not helping matters. The desire to give consumers and businesses confidence that they will not be whacked by higher borrowing costs was understandable. But a fight with the gilt market, which is still programmed to take its cue from the US bond prices, would create a different type of uncertainty. Most consumers do not obsess over gilt yields \u2013 but businesses leaders making investment decisions certainly do care about the credibility of UK monetary policy.</p> <p>The reality may be that forward guidance is a useful weapon when you're running the US Federal Reserve \u2013 after all, investors still hang on Ben Bernanke's every word. But, for central bankers elsewhere, it may just create new headaches. These are dangerous days for Carney. And, if he is right in thinking the bond market is being irrationally exuberant, for the recovery too.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-416702377\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Business/Pix/pictures/2013/9/6/1378486259008/Marks--Spencer-share-pric-001.jpg\" alt=\"Marks & Spencer share price\" width=\"460\" height=\"277\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marks & Spencer share price Photograph: Guardian/Yahoo Finance</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Has Marc Bolland finally cracked it? Marks &amp; Spencer's share price touched 500p on Friday for the first time since January 2008. The City, having been infuriated for two years by perpetual promises of better times around the next corner, thinks it smells substance.</p> <p>Bolland has certainly had a stroke of good fortune in the form of the whoosh of improving consumer confidence. M&amp;S's revamped autumn/winter ranges, on which he has staked his reputation by bringing in new management, can't fail to sell better than last year's collections. The buzz in the fashion press, notes the City, is also much improved.</p> <p>\"M&amp;S could enter a cycle of rising margins and improving return on capital via a return to positive general merchandise life-for-like sales growth,\" reckon the enthusiastic analysts at HSBC.</p> <p>Well, yes, it could. On the other hand, it would be unwise to place too much trust in a few glowing reviews for the handiwork of Belinda Earl, the new fashion chief. The fashion press, and the views of M&amp;S shoppers, have collided many times in the past. Putting on a good catwalk show in London is not same as making the clothes look attractive in an under-invested store hundreds of miles away from Marble Arch.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the huge sums invested in M&amp;S's distribution and logistics in the past few years still have to earn a return. M&amp;S is still half a decade behind the likes of Next in online retailing.</p> <p>Good luck to Bolland, whose strategy for M&amp;S has always seemed broadly correct - and the food division, his main problem on arrival in 2010, goes from strength to strength.

      "bodyText": "Tullow Oil, one of the Britain's most successful exploration groups, has made its first discovery in the Arctic in a move which will encourage more drilling and anger green groups campaigning against fossil fuel extraction in the region. Shares in Tullow climbed more than 3% as well operator OMV said it had struck a reservoir in the Barents Sea off the far north of Norway which could contain up to 160m barrels of oil and 40bn cubic feet of recoverable gas. \"This is a major frontier light oil discovery for Norway, Tullow Oil and our co-venturers. We look forward to pursuing the exciting exploration and appraisal follow up arising from this breakthrough discovery,\" said Angus McCoss, exploration director at Tullow, which holds a 20% stake in the prospect. \"The well results are a breakthrough for the regional exploration activities as the presence of good quality oil shows the possible large potential of an area, which will see more exploration drilling in the near future,\" said OMV in a statement. The Austrian company said the production licence 537 in which the well was drilled could hold as much as 500m barrels of oil equivalent based on similar geological evidence nearby. Tullow has become a stock market favourite on the back of major discoveries in Uganda and Ghana that helped establish those African nations as new oil producers. The company, led by Irishman Aidan Heavey, has also become the targets of various campaign groups who have accused it of political lobbying, tax avoidance and even bribery, allegations it has steadfastly denied. But the oil strike in the far north is a significant step for Tullow, which last autumn bought a 40% stake in exploration acreage of Greenland just weeks after the boss of French oil group, Total, said drilling in the Arctic should be abandoned because of the potential reputational and environmental damage if there was an oil spill. In March this year a new government in Greenland put a moratorium on the granting of fresh oil and gas licences in its Arctic waters but existing licences are still valid. British oil company Cairn Energy, which pioneered a new bout of exploration off Greenland two years ago, said it would resume its controversial exploration in that area in 2014. Greenpeace has made protection of the far north one of its key campaigns and last month its Arctic Sunrise vessel was chased out of Arctic waters by Russian coast guards after it approached a drill rig working for Moscow-based oil company, Rosneft. Russia and Norway signed an historic agreement to carve up the Barents Sea between them in 2010, a move which was expected to herald much more drilling in the region. The Oslo government unveiled 20 new exploration licences in the Barents during the summer and Statoil has already made big finds in the more southerly part of the Barents Andrew Whittock, an oil analyst with Liberum Capital in London, said the Tullow find was significant although these were early days to try to assess the reservoir's ultimate potential. \"This proves a new shallow play in the region.

And government bond yields remain higher today, pushing down bond yields (see 2.01pm) US trading continues to be volatile, still driven by Syria-related headlines as well as today's jobs data. The Dow Jones index is back in positive territory for the day, up 40 points at 14977.... And that's where I'm going to clock off. Back on Monday for more of the same. Thanks, and goodnight. GW. Back in Greece, schoolteachers have decided to take the sheen off Greek prime minister Antonis Samaras\u2019 much-anticipated speech on the state of the county\u2019s economy tomorrow (details at 11.18am) by announcing rolling strikes later this month. Our correspondent in Athens, Helena Smith, reports: Just as Antonis Samaras is preparing to talk up the Greek economy \u2013 in a speech that is expected to emphasise that the debt-stricken nation\u2019s dependence on foreign lenders could \u201csoon\u201d be over \u2013 unions are girding for battle. Primary and secondary school teachers have announced five-day rolling strikes beginning September 16. Educators in both sectors voted overwhelmingly to conduct the strikes in a massive display of opposition over government plans to lay off thousands of teachers by the end of the year. The protests, which will begin with a protest demonstration in Syntagma square tonight, are likely to wreak havoc on the education system and be a major embarrassment for a government desperately trying to keep the social peace by insisting that Greece\u2019s days under international stewardship are now numbered. \u201cIf need be we will bring the whole system down,\u201d exclaimed one leading unionist as she demonstrated outside the national economy ministry recently. \u201cAfter so many years of recession and cuts, these measures are totally barbaric.\u201d Athens\u2019 former mayor Nikitas Kaklamanis, a member of Samaras\u2019 centre right New Democracy party, has added to the gloom telling radio listeners today that the government\u2019s much-touted \u201csuccess story\u201d was well and truly over. \"Some time ago I asked the finance minister how many investments above one million euro, either by Greeks or foreigners, had been made in Greece in 2012 and do you know what the answer was? Four!,\u201d he said. \u201cTo speak about development and growth when that is the official answer is to make a mockery of the situation. I believe that the success story has well and truly been relocated to the past.\u201d The National Institute of Economic and Social Research thinktank has predicted that the UK economy grew by a rumbustious 0.9% in the three months to the end of August, or more than 3.6% on an annualised basis. That follows a string of strong economic data in recent weeks, and is an improvement on last month's reading -- when NIESR estimated that GDP rose by 0.7% in the May-July quarter. The group also predicted slower growth in the months ahead: Looking ahead, the rate of growth will likely soften, somewhat, over coming quarters. The external environment in the guise of weak demand from the Euro Area and slowing emerging markets will likely limit the rate of the UK\u2019s economic expansion. And even after such a good August, Britain's GDP is still 2.7% below its pre-crisis peak, with this recovery still the slowest on record. First it was Germany's banks (8.07am) now it's America's car industry which is feeling the love from the ratings agencies... Back in Europe, and the Open Europe thinktank has published an interesting theorette today - about how Germany's far left Die Linke party could hold the balance of power after the general elections on 22 September: This is how Merkel could flunk the elections: enter the Far Left It all relies on the fact that parties need to win 5% of the vote to win seats in the Bundestag, and Angela Merkel's coalition partners, the Free Democrats, are hovering close to the cliff-edge. Should FPD drop below 5%, Merkel's CDU would (probably) not win a majority on their own, so Die Linke could prop up a left-leaning coalition instead. One problem with this theory is that the Social Democrat's have ruled out a deal with their left-wing friends (or 'nutters', as Open Europe puts it). But election results can lead to funny alliances.... Mohamed El-Erian, chief executive of bond trading giant Pimco, reckons the Fed could well begin tapering this month despite the weaker-than-expected jobs data. He told Reuters: The market is taking this morning\u2019s somewhat disappointing data as suggesting that the Fed will not taper in September. I am not so sure that is the case. The detailed numbers also illustrate the problem of growing inequality in American society. That's an interesting line for El-Erian to take, given Pimco's exposure to the US bond market (where bond prices fall when tapering looks more likely). Capital Economics says today's US jobs data is a \"mixed bag\". The Fed could take it as a green light to start tapering its QE programme (as the unemployment rate fell), or as a warning (as June and July's data was revised down). Our best guess is that the cumulative evidence of improvement over the past year will convince a majority of officials that the tapering should begin at the next FOMC meeting later this month, but we're not going to pretend this is a certainty. That didn't last long. The Dow is now off by 120 points, and European markets are also in the red. I don't think US unemployment is the reason, though. World leaders are speaking to the press in St Petersburg following the G20 summit, and there's no breakthrough over Syria. Instead, president Putin has declared that he and president Obama are still at odds. As our G20 live blog explains: \"We stuck to our guns,\" Putin said according to a live translation. The Wall Street opening bell has been rung, and shares are inching higher in New York. The Dow Jones industrial average is up 47 points at 14985, +0.3%, with the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq rising by similar amounts. Our Wall Street correspondent Dominic Rushe writes: Unemployment in the US fell slightly to 7.3% in July, its lowest level in over four years, but the sluggish pace of recovery continued as the economy added just 169,000 new jobs. The latest nonfarm payroll figures come at a crucial moment for the Federal Reserve, which is weighing when and whether to cut its $85bn-a-month economic stimulus programme, known as quantitative easing (QE). Fed chairman Ben Bernanke has tied cuts in QE to the health of the job market. The federal reserve open markets committee (FOMC), which is split on when to pull back on the QE programme, meets on September 17-18. The jobless rate has now fallen from 8.1% a year ago but the pace of job creation remains slow and the Labor Department revised down its numbers for the previous two months after concluding job growth was less than expected. The US added jobs in retail, healthcare, food services and drinking places, professional and business services, and wholesale trade in August, said the bureau of labor statistics. Here's his full story: US unemployment rate drops to 7.3% amid sluggish economic recovery Another ace graph from Bloomberg's Michael McDonough, showing how participation by young people in the jobs market has fallen steadily over the last 23 years, while it has risen among the over 65s: And here's another line from the Non-Farm Payroll report, looking behind that headline unemployment rate of 7.3%: Among the major worker groups, the unemployment rates for adult men (7.1%), adult women (6.3%), teenagers (22.7%), whites (6.4%), blacks (13.0%), and Hispanics (9.3%) showed little change in August. The jobless rate for Asians was 5.1% (not seasonally adjusted), little changed from a year earlier. Ishaq Siddiqi, market strategist at ETX Capital, says it's \"unwise to say tapering is off the cards in September but it definitely has given the Fed and the market food for thought. In the bond markets, government borrowing costs have dropped -- another sign that the Federal Reserve is now less likely to start aggressively tapering its QE programme. Traders are rushing to buy sovereign debt, which pushes down the yield (interest rate). \u2022 US 10-year Treasury yield: 2.88%, down from 2.97% overnight \u2022 UK 10-year gilt yield: 2.93%, down from 3% overnight \u2022 German 10-year bund yield: 1.94%, down from 2.04% overnight Economics professor Nouriel Roubini insists today's jobs data means the US Fed should not slow its stimulus programme yet: Traders in the City and on Wall Street are calculating that today's Non-Farm Payroll report makes it less likely that the Federal Reserve will begin slowing its stimulus package this month. And when tapering begins, it could be at a slower rate than previously expected. With fewer jobs created in August than expected (169k vs 184k), and 74,000 fewer people hired in the previous too months, America's labour market does not look as strong as expected. And with the turmoil in the Middle East continuing, the Fed has other reasons to be cautious. The Fed is currently buying $85bn of bonds each month through its quantitative easing bond-buying programme every month. So the longer it runs, and the slower it tapers, the more money will be pumped into the system. Shares are rallying, gold is up, and the dollar is down since the US jobs data was released. Most currencies are strengthening against the US dollar -- sterling has gained half a cent to $1.564. Emerging market currencies are bouncing, with the Brazilian real up 1% against the dollar. The euro has gained 0.2%. In London the FTSE 100 is up 20 points. And gold is up $20 per ounce at $1,388/oz. Some instant reaction: Americans are working a little longer - the average working week increased by 6 minutes (or \"0.1 hour\") in August. Average earnings rose by 5 cents to $24.05. Over the year, average hourly earnings have risen by 52 cents, or 2.2%. The Non-Farm Payroll statement is online here. At 7.3%, America's jobless rate is its lowest since December 2008 (down from 7,4% last month). But that may not be a good sign, because the US Labour department has also reported that the labour force participation rate has dropped to 63.2%, the lowest since August 1978. That means more people have simply dropped out of America's potential workforce. July's non-farm payroll has been revised lower, to +104,000 new jobs -- that's sharply lower than the 162,000 that was reported a month ago. And fewer new jobs were created in June as well -- 172,000, not the 188,000 that was expected. That means 74,000 fewer American jobs were created in June and July than we thought. Breaking: The US economy created 169,000 new jobs in August. That's below the consensus forecast that the US non-farm payroll rose by 180,000 last month. And the jobless rate has fallen to 7.3%. However, previous data for June and July has been revised down....

Analysts will also be watching to see if the US Labour Department revises its previous data. This Bloomberg graph shows how the borrowing costs of major economies such as the UK and Germany, and emerging markets, have risen since the prospect of the Fed slowing, or 'tapering', its bond-buying programme emerged It's via Bloomberg's global head of economics, Michael McDonough. What happens if August's US non-farm payroll is significantly different from the consensus forecast of 180,000 new jobs? Joe Bond of City firm Abshire Smith has some suggestions for how markets could react -- based on the idea that a strong reading increases the chances that the Fed will start cutting its bond-buying stimulus programme this month. \u2022 Above 200K jobs would see the US dollar (USD) bid across the board, further weakness for emerging market currencies and gold \u2022 170-200K would still be bullish (average print for the year slightly north of 180K) \u2022 Below 170K would be a poor number, with USD offered, and Gold bid \u2022Anything below 120K would be a huge disappointment, providing large volatility for USD and Gold. I mentioned earlier that the consensus forecast is that 180,000 new jobs were created in the US last month. Each analyst, though, has a different guesstimate -- and they range from just 79,000 to as much as 220,000, as market analysts RANsquawk explains: Just 45 minutes to go until the US jobs data for August is released (at 1.30pm BST, or 8.30am EDT), and European markets are jittery. Most indices are lower, as traders wait for the big number of the day. Chris Beauchamp of IG Index says it's been a nervous morning after some busy days: It\u2019s been a busy week really; economic news, geopolitical concerns and tapering worries have all have been thrown at investors in one form or another...the overall impression is one of extreme caution. With non-farm payrolls out today, this caution has only been heightened. One for twitter users who want to relive the dark days of Lehman Brothers: This chart shows how Greece's GDP slump has slowed over the last six quarters (including the 3.8% annual contraction in the last quarter reported this morning), but is still some way from ending. Germany has reported a sharp fall in industrial production during July. Output across German industry dropped by 1.7% on a month-on-month basis, much worse than the 0.5% drop that was expected. The German economy ministry said the drop was due \"not least\" to a strong June (when output jumped by 2%), insisting that conditions are improving: The weak phase is over... Overall, the upward trend appears to be continuing moderately in manufacturing and significantly stronger in construction. But with exports dropping by 1.1% in July (see 8.01am), it doesn't feel like July was a knockout month for Germany. Speaking of Greece... security will be tight in the city of Thessaloniki tomorrow when prime minister Antonis Samaras visits its annual trade fair Local media report that 4,000 police officers, including motorcycle patrols and two helicopters, will be on duty at the 78th Thessaloniki International Fair (TIF), which Samaras will open with a keynote speech. Samaras is expected to argue that the Greek economy is improving (so he should be encouraged by this morning's GDP data). Government opponents, though, will be holding an anti-austerity rally on Saturday, from 6pm Greek time. Greece's Kathimerini newspaper has more details: The premier, who is to address businessmen in the morning and not in the traditional evening speech, will reportedly try to reassure entrepreneurs, and citizens in general, that Greece's economy is improving, slowly but surely, and that no more austerity measures are on the cards. Samaras is also expected to stress the importance of Greece clinching a primary surplus this year, as appears likely, as this will allow the government to offer some relief to lower-income Greeks. The premier had indicated in an interview last week that 70 percent of the primary surplus, if it is achieved, will go toward support for those on low pensions. Greece's long, grim depression could finally be turning a corner. Its economy is still contracting, but at a rather slower pace. The country's economy shrank by 3.8% on a year-on-year basis in the second quarter of this year, updated data shows. That's a significantly smaller decline than the 5.6% annual contraction measured in the first three months. Greece doesn't report quarter-on-quarter data like most other countries, so it's hard to tell exactly how the economy performed between April and June. It's clear, though, that the contraction must have eased. Good timing, as the eurozone faces up to the task of patching up its finances again next year. The British public are taking Mark Carney seriously, even if the City are not. A quarterly survey of inflation expectations found that the number of people who expect interest rates to rise in the next 12 months has fallen to its lowest level since November 2008, at just 29%. Inflation expectations have also fallen to the lowest since August 2012. The survey of 2,500 Brits took between August 8th and 13th. Carney announced on August 7th that rates will not rise from their record lows until the UK jobless rate has dropped to 7% from 7.8%, which the Bank doesn't see until 2016. Governor Carney should be reassured by this data, particularly as inflation expectations are one factor that could force him to abandon the plan. Some City traders, though, are pricing in a rate rise by the end of 2014. The survey also found that public confidence in the Bank of England had dropped to a nine-month low, with a net balance of +15 people believing it was doing a good job. The disappointing UK trade and industrial production data this morning have prompted experts to warn that economic conditions in Britain, and beyond, may not be as rosy as hoped Britain's widening trade gap in July (9.40am )was primarily caused by a sharp drop in exports to countries outside the EU. Exports of all commodities except fuel fell during the month, the Office for National Statistics reported, led by a decrease in exports of \"finished manufactures\". Here's the key points from the ONS release: Seasonally adjusted, the UK\u2019s deficit on trade in goods and services was estimated to have been \u00a33.1bn in July, compared with a deficit of \u00a31.3bn in June. There was a deficit of \u00a39.9bn on goods, partly offset by an estimated surplus of \u00a36.8bn on services. Exports of goods fell 7.6% on the month to \u00a324.8bn for July 2013. Imports for the same period fell 1.0% to \u00a334.7bn In July 2013, exports of goods to countries outside of the European Union (EU) decreased by \u00a32.2bn to \u00a311.8bn. Exports to countries within the EU increased by \u00a30.2bn over the same period to \u00a313bn. On a slightly longer-term view, imports outstripped exports over the last three months: The deficit on trade in goods increased \u00a30.3bn to \u00a326.8bn in the three months to July 2013 from \u00a326.5bn in the three months to April 2013. Exports of goods in the three months to July 2013 increased to \u00a377.4bn and compared to the previous year, increased by 1.6%. Imports of goods also increased over the same period to a record high of \u00a3104.2bn and compared to the previous year, increased by 3.1%. Britain's trade deficit more than doubled in July, and industrial production failed to grow as expected. The data, just released, is a rare reversal for the UK after recent strong economic statistics that have suggested the recovery has legs. The UK trade deficit in goods and services widened to \u00a33.085bn, the worst monthly reading since October 2012. Twice as wide as June's figure, it doesn't suggest that that UK economy has moved into a more robust, manufacturing led revival as hoped (although these monthly readings are rather volatile). Industrial production, meanwhile, was flat month-on-month in July, dashing hopes of a 0.1% rise. Within the data, manufacturing rose by 0.2% month-on-month, compared with hopes of a 0.3% rise. More to follow...... There was drama in the Cyprus parliament last night where MPs rejected crucial legislation related to its bailout package, before eventually falling into line. A vote on laws to bring its 'co-operation banks' under the control of the Cypriot central bank was narrowly defeated, raising the sudden threat that its aid programme could be derailed. But after meeting late into the night, the legislation was finally approved: Reuters reports: In a marathon voting session, legislators agreed to a clause enabling co-op banks to receive \u20ac1.5bn ($1.97bn) in bailout money. In an earlier vote, it had been narrowly rejected by lawmakers from the island's opposition left-wing parties, who oppose any bailout conditions. Parliamentary approval for restructuring co-ops, which are small commercial lenders, is crucial to Cyprus receiving the next aid installment of \u20ac1.5bn from international lenders. The money will be ploughed into the lenders to recapitalise them. In a second vote in the early hours of Friday, parliament approved the restructuring of the co-ops, finance ministry sources said. The second vote was in the great traditions of European Union democracy, argues Michael Hewson of CMC Markets: There was two votes in the Cypriot parliament before politicians arrived at the \u201cright\u201d decision with respect to the latest bailout package in what has become a very European past time. If you don\u2019t get the result you want in the first vote, vote again until you get the right outcome. One more gobbet of economic news -- UK house prices are rising at their fastest rate since 2010. Halifax reported that prices jumped by 5.4% in the three months to August, compared with a year ago. However, the lender argues that the trend is slowing, as prices were only up by 0.4% last month compared with 0.9% in July. Halifax housing economist Martin Ellis reckons: Relatively modest economic growth and below inflation rises in earnings are likely to act as a brake on the market. Overall, house prices are expected to rise gradually over the remainder of the year. But while prices keep rising, critics of George Osborne will probably keep warning that the chancellor is fueling a dangerous housing bubble with his 'help to buy'mortgage subsidy scheme. French consumer confidence is also up, rising from 82 in July in 84 in August. Best reading since April, showing a recovery from the record low of 79 high in May and June. Still some way to get back to the long-term average of 100, though... There's good news for Germany's banks this morning. Moody's has raised its outlook on the sector from negative to stable, which removes the threat of a downgrade. The ratings agency said the move reflected \" a year of reduced crisis-related losses and improved capital strength\". It cited four reasons for the upgrade: prospects of a stable operating environment due to an improving economy and benign credit environment; continued strengthening of the banks' capital buffers due, in part, to more stringent capital requirements; the stabilising effect of an ongoing reduction in high-risk assets and deleveraging; and improved refinancing structures and ample liquidity buffers, which imply low funding risk. Here's the full statement. Another encouraging signal for the eurozone. Worth noting, though, that we're still waiting for the ECB's next stress test, or asset quality review, of euro area banks... This morning's early trade data shows that Germany's trade surplus has shrunk, and France's trade deficit has widened. German exports dropped by 1.1 % in July, dashing economist expectations of a 0.8% rise. And with imports up by 0.5%, the German surplus narrowed to \u20ac14.5bn, from \u20ac15.8bn in June. Stefan Schilbe at HSBC Trinkaus told Reuters it was \"a disappointment\", adding: But we can be hopeful that the picture will change for the better in coming months. Leading indicators in industrial states - from the United States to Britain and the euro zone states - are pointing upwards. Arguably a Germany that imports a little more, and exports a little less, is good for the rest of the eurozone as it tries to rebalance its economy. Over in France, the trade deficit widened to \u20ac5.109bn in July, from \u20ac4.484bn in June. The French Customs Office blamed a jump in imports due to higher energy costs, and supplies for its aerospace industry. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the latest events across the global economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and the business world. Today's big event in the financial world is the latest US jobs data, which will be unleashed on an expectant financial world after lunchtime in Europe (1.30pm BST, or 8.30am New York time). The non-farm payroll always makes a splash, as it shows how many new jobs were created (or lost) in the world's biggest economy the previous month. Today's number is pretty special \u2013 it could prompt America's Federal Reserve central bank to start slowing its stimulus package, if it judges that the US economy is finally strong enough to take it. Economists expect around 180,000 new jobs were created in the US last month (excluding the agriculture sector), up from 162,000 in July. But non-farm is notoriously tricky to predict.... This graph from Marketwatch shows the monthly non-farm payroll since the start of last year -- job creation has been generally steady, rather than spectacular... The implications of the Fed 'tapering' its $85bn bond-buying programme are significant for the world economy. Taper anticipation is one factor pushing up government borrowing costs (the UK 10-year gilt yield hit 3% yesterday, while 10-year bund yields are over 2%). Also coming up today, we have trade data from key European countries and the latest UK industrial output stats. Germany has already reported a surprise drop in exports in July (more to follow...) I'll also be watching the eurozone closely, as speculation mounts over a future aid package for Greece in 2014....",

      "bodyText": "Unemployment in the US fell slightly to 7.3% in July, its lowest level in over four years, but the sluggish pace of recovery continued as the economy added just 169,000 new jobs. The latest nonfarm payroll figures come at a crucial moment for the Federal Reserve, which is weighing when and whether to cut its $85bn-a-month economic stimulus programme, known as quantitative easing (QE). Fed chairman Ben Bernanke has tied cuts in QE to the health of the job market. The Federal Reserve open markets committee (FOMC), which is split on when to pull back on the QE programme, meets on September 17-18. The jobless rate has now fallen from 8.1% a year ago but the pace of job creation remains slow and the Labor Department revised down its numbers for the previous two months after concluding job growth was less than expected. The US added jobs in retail, healthcare, food services and drinking places, professional and business services and wholesale trade in August, said the bureau of labor statistics. The number of long-term unemployed (those jobless for 27 weeks or more) was largely unchanged at 4.3m, these individuals accounted for 37.9% of the unemployed. Unemployment for teenagers remained extremely high at 22.7% and for black people, at 13%, and Hispanics, at 9.3%. The number of people not in the workforce in August rose to 90.47m, from 89.95m in July. Republican house speaker John Boehner called the figures \"mediocre\". Gus Faucher, senior economist at PNC Bank said they were \"disappointing\". \"It's not just the headline number, it's also the downward revisions to the previous months. The unemployment rate fell but for the wrong reasons, less people are participating in the labour force.\" June's nonfarm payroll figure was revised down from 188,000 to 172,000 and July was revised from 162,000 to 104,000. The revisions mean the US added 74,000 less jobs in June and July than previously reported. \"The labour market is not as strong as we had previously thought. I think this means the Fed is less likely to taper off QE when it meets later this month,\" said Faucher. On Thursday payroll company ADP said US businesses added 176,000 jobs in August, fewer than in June and July but in line with economists' expectations. Companies in all industries and of all sizes hired in August, ADP said, with professional and business services firms adding 50,000 jobs. Manufacturers created 5,000, reversing a drop in July, and construction firms added 4,000. Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Analytics, which helps compile ADP's report, said: \"It is steady as she goes in the job market. Job gains in August were consistent with increases experienced over the past two-plus years. There is little evidence that fiscal austerity and healthcare reform have had a significant impact on the job market.\"",

      "bodyText": "A recent rise in manufacturing output failed to override a bad year for Britain's factories, according to official figures on Friday. The Office for National Statistics said industrial production fell 1.9% in the year to the end of July dragged down by lacklustre output of machinery and equipment. A decline in the production of steel and other metals dragged the manufacturing sector down by 0.7%, adding to falls in North Sea oil output that have hit the broader figures for several years. Manufacturing grew in June and July, but this spurt of activity, largely down to a turnaround in machinery and steel production, was not enough to offset falls dating back to last year when the government's austerity policies were hitting consumer confidence and the euro crisis was at its height. The recent rise in production has been welcomed by George Osborne as a sign that his economic policies are bearing fruit. But he is likely to be dismayed by trade figures from the ONS showing that the UK's recent growth has pulled in a record volume of imports and more than doubled the trade deficit to \u00a33.1bn. Imports rose to \u00a3104.2bn in the three months to July, a 3.1% increase, while exports to the EU remained flat and the trade in goods to countries outside the bloc fell sharply. David Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), said the figures showed manufacturers still faced a challenge to recover from the financial crash, despite a \"respectable\" increase of 0.9% compared with the previous three months. \"Longer-term comparisons highlight the challenges facing manufacturing.
