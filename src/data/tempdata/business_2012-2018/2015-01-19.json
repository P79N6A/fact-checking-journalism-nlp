      "body": "<p>The former chief executive of Tesco, Sir Terry Leahy, has broken his silence on the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/dec/09/tesco-issues-massive-profit-warning-share-price-plunges\" title=\"\">crisis engulfing the country\u2019s biggest retailer</a> by claiming there was a failure of leadership under his successor, Philip Clarke.</p> <p>Leahy, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/feb/25/tesco-sir-terry-leahy-retires\" title=\"\">who stepped down in 2011 after 14 years at the grocer\u2019s helm</a>, told the BBC\u2019s Panorama programme: \u201cPeople tried very hard to do the right thing; it clearly has not worked. In the end, that\u2019s a failure of leadership, not a failure of the business, not a failure of the people who work hard every day in the business. When you\u2019re the CEO, if it goes well, you get credit, if it doesn\u2019t go well, you must take responsibility and Phil Clarke has taken that responsibility and paid the price with his job.\u201d</p> <p>After a series of profit warnings, Clarke was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jul/21/tesco-boss-philip-clarke-quits-profits-warning\" title=\"\">sacked last summer</a> and replaced by former Unilever executive Dave Lewis. Tesco has since become embroiled in an accounting scandal that is now the subject of a Serious Fraud Office investigation.</p> <p>Given the collapse in profitability in the wake of Leahy\u2019s departure, his own legacy has come under scrutiny. He was previously celebrated for turning Tesco into a global retail giant, but problems at home \u2013 where it is now closing and abandoning stores \u2013 as well as the decision to pull the plug on US venture Fresh &amp; Easy, has led to a re-evaluation.</p> <p>At the first sign of trouble, Clarke famously accused the Leahy regime of running the important UK business \u201ctoo hot\u201d \u2013 a phrase that described the process of shoring up profits during recession by making cost savings and starving stores of investment. But Leahy Batted the suggestion aside in a Panorama documentary broadcast on Monday night, arguing that the bigger problem was that Tesco took its eye off the ball on price.</p> <p>\u201cThe acid test is, are you attracting customers?\u201d is Leahy\u2019s response. \u201cYes we were, more customers each year. Were sales growing? Yes they were. Tesco is the biggest, people expect it to have the best prices,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that some of that trust has been eroded, which has meant that people have shopped around.\u201d</p> <p>After years of stable leadership, Clarke\u2019s appointment led to a stream of high-level departures and the criticism that there had been a brain drain. \u201cI think it lost too much talent,\u201d Leahy told the BBC. \u201cIt\u2019s a big company, Tesco, and also very empowered \u2013 people were given responsibility and trusted to get on with their job, so there was a big team of experienced leaders. And too many of those were allowed to go in too short a period of time and so there was a shortage of experience, the kind of experience you need to carefully navigate a business like Tesco through this very turbulent and difficult period of this long, long recession, with these changes in structure of retailing taking place.\u201d</p> <p>Leahy wewnt on to say that the company\u2019s culture changed under Clarke and \u201cnot for the better\u201d.

      "bodyText": "The former chief executive of Tesco, Sir Terry Leahy, has broken his silence on the crisis engulfing the country\u2019s biggest retailer by claiming there was a failure of leadership under his successor, Philip Clarke. Leahy, who stepped down in 2011 after 14 years at the grocer\u2019s helm, told the BBC\u2019s Panorama programme: \u201cPeople tried very hard to do the right thing; it clearly has not worked. In the end, that\u2019s a failure of leadership, not a failure of the business, not a failure of the people who work hard every day in the business. When you\u2019re the CEO, if it goes well, you get credit, if it doesn\u2019t go well, you must take responsibility and Phil Clarke has taken that responsibility and paid the price with his job.\u201d After a series of profit warnings, Clarke was sacked last summer and replaced by former Unilever executive Dave Lewis. Tesco has since become embroiled in an accounting scandal that is now the subject of a Serious Fraud Office investigation. Given the collapse in profitability in the wake of Leahy\u2019s departure, his own legacy has come under scrutiny. He was previously celebrated for turning Tesco into a global retail giant, but problems at home \u2013 where it is now closing and abandoning stores \u2013 as well as the decision to pull the plug on US venture Fresh &amp; Easy, has led to a re-evaluation. At the first sign of trouble, Clarke famously accused the Leahy regime of running the important UK business \u201ctoo hot\u201d \u2013 a phrase that described the process of shoring up profits during recession by making cost savings and starving stores of investment. But Leahy Batted the suggestion aside in a Panorama documentary broadcast on Monday night, arguing that the bigger problem was that Tesco took its eye off the ball on price. \u201cThe acid test is, are you attracting customers?\u201d is Leahy\u2019s response. \u201cYes we were, more customers each year. Were sales growing? Yes they were. Tesco is the biggest, people expect it to have the best prices,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that some of that trust has been eroded, which has meant that people have shopped around.\u201d After years of stable leadership, Clarke\u2019s appointment led to a stream of high-level departures and the criticism that there had been a brain drain. \u201cI think it lost too much talent,\u201d Leahy told the BBC. \u201cIt\u2019s a big company, Tesco, and also very empowered \u2013 people were given responsibility and trusted to get on with their job, so there was a big team of experienced leaders. And too many of those were allowed to go in too short a period of time and so there was a shortage of experience, the kind of experience you need to carefully navigate a business like Tesco through this very turbulent and difficult period of this long, long recession, with these changes in structure of retailing taking place.\u201d Leahy wewnt on to say that the company\u2019s culture changed under Clarke and \u201cnot for the better\u201d. He said: \u201cI think if you talked to people who knew Tesco, worked in Tesco when I was there, actually the culture was pretty positive and it has to be, because it employs half a million people and you can\u2019t make them do things, you have to motivate them to do things, they\u2019ve got to want to do it.\u201d In a statement to the BBC, Clarke said: \u201cAlthough the company had enjoyed unprecedented success in the past, it was plainly the case when I took over Tesco in 2011 that it faced a number of critical challenges that had been building for some time. In bringing about business and cultural change within the company, inevitably some executives who were not considered to have a role to play in the future of the business were let go. There are many others who remain silent out of loyalty to the company and who would describe Tesco under my leadership very differently.\u201d In an attempt to turn round the business, Lewis has announced plans to shut the retailer\u2019s head office in Cheshunt, Hertfordshire, raising the spectre of thousands of job cuts as part of a shakeup that will also see the closure or abandonment of nearly 100 stores. The Panorama programme also delved into the background of last autumn\u2019s accounting scandal, which stems from how Tesco accounts for promotional monies received from suppliers and which resulted in first-half profit forecasts being artificially inflated by \u00a3263m, and revealed a falling out between Tesco and cosmetics giant L\u2019Or\u00e9al \u2013 which led the French company to threaten legal action \u2013 over a disputed payment of about \u00a31m demanded by Tesco.

      "bodyText": "The Serious Fraud Office has closed its criminal investigation into the sale of Autonomy to Hewlett-Packard, but the Department of Justice in the US will continue its scrutiny of the deal. The move comes almost a year after British prosecutors opened their investigation into the controversial 2011 deal, after receiving a complaint from HP. The \u00a37bn transaction has been the subject of lawsuits and investigations ever since HP issued a shock $8.8bn (\u00a35.8bn) profits warning in November 2012, in large part blaming \u201cserious accounting improprieties, disclosure failures and outright misrepresentations at Autonomy\u201d. The US group has accused \u201csome former members of Autonomy\u2019s management team used accounting improprieties, misrepresentations and disclosure failures\u201d to inflate the value of the company by more than $5bn. In a statement on Monday, the SFO said that it had reviewed evidence and concluded: \u201cIn respect of some aspects of the allegations ... there is insufficient evidence for a realistic prosecution.\u201d But the agency added: \u201cIn respect of other aspects ... jurisdiction over the investigation has been ceded to the US authorities whose investigation is ongoing.\u201d The department of justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission are both pursuing parallel probes in the US. Lynch, an Irish-born mathematician who founded Autonomy and led the business when it was sold, on Monday welcomed the move by the SFO to, in effect, reject some of the allegations made by HP. \u201cAs we have always said, HP\u2019s allegations are false and we are glad that after a two year review of the material presented by HP, the SFO has concluded that there is not a case to pursue,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s remember, HP made allegations of a $5bn dollar fraud, and presented the case in public as a slam dunk. HP now faces serious questions of its own about its conduct in this case and the false statements it has made.\u201d The former Autonomy chief executive did not comment on the SFO\u2019s decision to make clear not all allegations had been exhausted. In cases of alleged fraud involving more than one jurisdiction, prosecutors around the world often reach a collective decision on which agency should take the lead, and which should provide a supportive role. Some UK-based individuals facing fraud allegations have fought hard to have their case dealt with in British courts, where sentencing and conviction rates can be lower. No prosecuting agency has brought charges against Lynch or anyone else in relation to the HP allegations. HP is standing by its complaints to criminal prosecution agencies and on Monday night reiterated its determination to pursue the matter through the civil courts. \u201cAs the SFO made clear, the US authorities are continuing their investigation and we continue to cooperate with that investigation,\u201d a spokesperson said. \u201cHP remains committed to holding the architects of the [alleged] Autonomy fraud accountable.\u201d A cluster of civil complaints have been building up in the US courts. These claims have stalled as a California judge considers settlement proposals HP wishes to reach with its shareholders, joining forces to pursue fomer Autonomy executives. Civil claims have alleged that Autonomy\u2019s accounts were deeply flawed, with sales growth, certain revenues and operating margins all allegedly lower than was reported in the books. Lynch and other former Autonomy executives have consistently denied that anything was kept from HP. HP hopes to settle complaints that include allegations that former executives had ignored red flags before signing the ill-fated acquisition of Autonomy. Among the warning signs, the claims allege, were concerns about the UK group\u2019s finances raised by hedge funds, media and analysts; the large amounts of goodwill HP was forced to book on the deal; alleged opposition to the transaction from HP\u2019s finance director Catherine Lesjak; and warnings about Autonomy\u2019s overvaluation from Oracle chief executive Larry Ellison.",

Banks in particular were in demand, as the FTSEurofirst hit a seven year high. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished 35.26 points or 0.54% higher at 6585.53 Germany\u2019s Dax was up 0.73% at 10,242.35 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.35% better at 4394.93 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB rose 1.17% to 19,480.53 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 1.18% at 10,157.5 In Greece, the Athens market added 2.68% to 811.78 Switzerland\u2019s SMI was up 3.21% at 8152.78 Wall Street was closed for Martin Luther King Day. Elsewhere oil was on the slide again, with Brent crude down 2.3% at $49 a barrel. On that note, it\u2019s time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments and we\u2019ll be back again tomorrow. The European Central Bank will announce a \u20ac600bn sovereign bond buying programme on Thursday, according to a poll of money market traders by Reuters: Eighteen of 20 in Monday\u2019s poll said the bank would announce QE on Thursday. Calls for such a step have escalated after inflation turned negative in December. But 14 of 18 traders said such bond buying would not be enough to bring inflation back up to the central bank\u2019s target 2% ceiling. \u201cWill it be enough to raise inflation? That is questionable, probably not. The problem is whether throwing extra money is the solution. What is lacking is final demand in the area,\u201d said a euro money market trader. A separate Reuters poll of economists gave a near-certain 90% chance the ECB would embark on full-blown QE. Denmark is unlikely to abandon its currency peg with the euro, despite such a move by the Swiss National Bank last week. That is the view of Capital Economics, following the news that Denmark\u2019s central bank has cut interest rates further into negative territory to try and halt gains made by the crown against the euro. Capital Economics\u2019 Andrew Kenningham said: The decision by the Danish central bank to cut interest rates deeper into negative territory on Monday follows speculation that the Danish krone might be the next to break its link to the euro, having come under upward pressure in recent weeks. With the ECB apparently close to pulling the trigger on a full-blown QE programme, there may still be substantial inflows to Denmark. What\u2019s more, Denmark ran a current account surplus of around 7% of GDP last year. However, there are two key reasons why we think the risk of the Danish central bank capitulating and letting the krone appreciate is very remote. First, the Danish currency peg has been in place for over thirty years, whereas the Swiss ceiling was introduced only 3\u00bd years ago. Accordingly, the Danish authorities have a lot more at stake. We suspect that the Danish central bank is far more strongly committed to its peg than the SNB turned out to be to its currency ceiling. Second, the Danish central bank\u2019s balance sheet has not ballooned over the past few years in the way that the SNB\u2019s balance sheet has. This is partly because the Danish krone is not perceived to be as much of a safe haven currency as the Swiss franc. While the SNB\u2019s motives for abandoning its currency ceiling are not entirely clear, its bloated balance sheet, and correspondingly large monetary base, seems to have been a key concern. To be clear, we do expect the krone to come under further upward pressure soon. But the authorities are likely to respond with further currency intervention, and perhaps further rate cuts, rather than by abandoning the currency regime. The plunge in oil prices, sanctions following the situation in Ukraine and eurozone weakness mean Russia\u2019s economy will shrink by 4.8% this year. This is the forecast of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and is far more severe than the 2.9% decline predicted last week by the World Bank. EBRD economist Hans Peter Lankes said (courtesy Reuters): Even this forecast is subject to considerable risks. Further significant drops in the oil price would intensify liquidity and financial sector pressures in the Russian economy, with significant spill-over effects for Eastern Europe, the Caucasus and Central Asia. The Danish move has prompted questions about the cap with the euro: Speaking of the ECB and this week\u2019s meeting: Ahead of the ECB meeting and following last week\u2019s shock move by the Swiss National Bank to remove the currency peg against the euro comes news that Danish central bank has cut its deposit rate by 0.15 percentage points to minus 0.2%. The move comes after the Danish crown - which is pegged against the euro - gained ground against the single currency, hitting a two and a half year high earlier. After the news the crown fell back while the Danish stock market has risen 2.5% to a new record. Meanwhile the Swiss franc has slipped back against the euro in the wake of the Danish move. More speculation ahead of the European Central Bank meeting on Thursday, widely expected to authorise some form of quantitative easing to boost the eurozone economy, weaken the euro further and combat the prospect of deflation. However Germany\u2019s Bundesbank has always been reluctant to turn on the money taps, and could be attempting to curtail what the ECB announces, Reuters is reporting: Germany\u2019s Bundesbank is mounting a last-ditch drive to limit money-printing by the ECB, hoping either to soften the blueprint or delay decisions on key parts beyond this week, people familiar with the debate say. With markets primed for a European Central Bank announcement on Thursday, Germany\u2019s central bank is worried that a programme to buy government bonds would leave it on the hook for any losses. No final decision on the plan has been made and the Bundesbank is still seeking safeguards, including a likely move to make national central banks rather than the ECB bear much of the risk for buying the bonds of eurozone member states. The size of the programme to buy bonds, known as quantitative easing, and a possible delay to its launch are also part of the debate. \u201cWhat exactly comes and in what dosage, that\u2019s where the real action is at the moment,\u201d said one person familiar with Bundesbank thinking. \u201cIt could be that the decision is taken with details to follow.\u201d Although the Bundesbank\u2019s position within the ECB carries huge weight because Germany is the bloc\u2019s biggest economy, its allies are few in number on the 25-strong Governing Council. The ECB\u2019s Executive Board, the six-person team that is at the core of decision-making, will meet on Tuesday to prepare recommendations to the wider group including central bankers from Athens to Rome, who gather from Wednesday. By postponing the announcement of elements of the plan, ECB President Mario Draghi could avoid a clash - at least for now - with Bundesbank chief Jens Weidmann and his supporters, but at the risk of a dangerous market backlash. Investors are already jittery after the Swiss central bank\u2019s surprise move last week to scrap a cap on the franc. The ECB declined to comment. More on China: A quick recap. China\u2019s stock market has tumbled by almost 8%, the biggest fall since the height of the financial crisis, following a clampdown on risky trading practices. Chinese regulators imposed margin trading curbs on several major brokerages, preventing them from lending money to retail investors to buy shares with. Analysts say it shows they are tightening up after seeing shares jump by 50% in the last year. But in Europe, shares have hit new seven-year highs on anticipation that the European Central Bank will announce new stimulus measures on Thursday. QE-inspired optimism is swilling through the markets, as Alastair McCaig of IG explains: This is the week equity markets believe the European Central Bank will announce its own version of quantitative easing as the first couple of hours have seen European equity markets hit multi-year highs. Certainly the markets\u2019 reaction to disappointing economic data in the last couple of weeks has shown they believe \u2018bad news is good\u2019, and as the picture gets a little worse its brings the ECB a step closer to implementing QE. French president Francois Hollande has raised the stakes, declaring: On Thursday, the ECB will take the decision to buy sovereign debt, which will provide significant liquidity to the European economy and create a movement that is favourable to growth. The euro, though, has strengthened a little \u2013 up half a cent to \u20ac1.1614. That suggests some traders may be anticipating that the ECB doesn\u2019t meet expectations. The Swiss franc has also been volatile again, as investors count the cost of the removal of its peg against the euro. Stephen Lewis of ADM Investor Services point out that traders had become used to central banks sparing them from big losses: At the root of the dissatisfaction with the SNB\u2019s action may be the fact that some market participants have suffered enormous losses. This was not supposed to happen in the post-crisis world, or indeed at any time since the rather shocking bond market sell-off of 1994. Since then, market participants have come to rely on central banks to intervene in investors\u2019 interests whenever market conditions become difficult. Something that will be on the agenda at Davos this week, I imagine. As will inequality, with Oxfam flagging up that the richest continue to grab a greater share of global wealth: Here\u2019s our story: New Oxfam report says half of global wealth held by the 1% I\u2019m off to pack for Davos, so Nick Fletcher has the controls.... GW Juho Romakkaniemi, chief of staff to European commissioner Jyrki Katainen, tweets that Europe faces some crucial days: Speaking of eurozone QE...analyst Lorcan Roche Kelly argues that that it may make a lot of sense for national central banks to start buying their own sovereign\u2019s debt (one option the ECB could choose). Here\u2019s his blogpost. French president Francois Hollande has apparently declared that the European Central Bank will announce a big new stimulus package on Thursday. In a surprising intervention, Hollande told business leaders at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace that: On Thursday, the ECB will take the decision to buy sovereign debt, which will provide significant liquidity to the European economy and create a movement that is favourable to growth. (hat-tip to the Wall Street Journal for the quote) Fact of the day: There are at least 30,000 unemployed Britons across Europe claiming welfare benefits, including over 11,000 in Ireland and 6,000 in Germany. That\u2019s according to a new report from Guardian colleagues Alberto Nardelli, Ian Traynor and Leila Haddou. It shows that unemployed Britons in Europe are drawing much more in benefits and allowances in the wealthier EU countries than their nationals are claiming in the UK. In Finland, Sweden, Denmark, Belgium, Luxembourg, Germany, Austria, France and Ireland the number of Britons banking unemployment cheques is almost three times as high as the nationals of those countries receiving parallel UK benefits \u2013 23,011 Britons to 8,720 nationals of those nine countries in the UK. The findings highlight a more nuanced and complex picture across Europe than the simplistic version painted by anti-immigration and anti-EU campaigners led by Ukip and elements in the Conservative party. Here\u2019s the full report: Revealed: thousands of Britons on benefits across EU And we\u2019ve also been looking for the only Brit claiming unemployment benefit in Poland, without success.... The Bundesbank is to cut its inflation forecast for 2015, following the slide in the oil price. It is also more upbeat about Germany\u2019s growth prospects. That\u2019s two highlights from its latest monthly report, just released: BUNDESBANK SAYS GERMAN ECONOMY APPEARS TO HAVE OVERCOME WEAK PERIOD QUICKER THAN EXPECTED - MONTHLY REPORT BUNDESBANK SAYS LOW OIL PRICE MEANS THAT ITS DECEMBER INFLATION FORECASTS FOR 2015 MUST BE REVISED SHARPLY DOWNWARDS BUNDESBANK SAYS CONSUMER PRICES IN GERMANY LIKELY TO RISE ONLY SLIGHTLY IN CURRENT YEAR On inflation, it says: \u201cIf the oil price stays at the current level, then the consumer prices in Germany will rise only a little in the current year\u201d. Stephen Murray, energy expert at MoneySuperMarket, isn\u2019t too impressed by British Gas\u2019s promise of a 5% price cut in late February. \u201cA cut in energy prices is always welcome however, just like we saw with E.ON, this decrease is small in comparison to the whopping 20 per cent drop in the price of wholesale gas over the last 12 months. Furthermore, British Gas customers will have to wait a whole month before they see any reduction in their bills at a time when energy use is at its peak. British Gas is the second utility firm to act, after E.ON. That leaves four (SSE, Scottish Power, nPower and EDF) who haven\u2019t reacted to tumbling wholesale prices \u201cThe ball is firmly in the court of the remainder of the big six who are yet to make the next move and honour the energy savings that really should have been passed on to customers months ago.\u201d The slump in energy prices has prompted British Gas to cut prices by 5%. Not until the end of February, though, which won\u2019t help people turning their thermostats up to cope with the current wintery blast. Hilary Osborne has the story: British Gas to cut prices by 5% \u2013 but customers must wait another month Back to the slump in the Chinese stock market today. As explained earlier, regulators banned three large brokerage firms from opening new margin trading accounts (which allow retail investors to buy shares with borrowed money) for three months. Other brokerage firms were given warnings, showing that the authorities are keen to rein in excessive speculation after watching shares jump 50% in the last year. Fidelity Worldwide Investment says authorities are \u201cserious about controlling risk and leverage in the system\u201d. Jing Ning, portfolio manager, explains: \u201cThis fall is not a surprise given how fast the A-share market has rallied, yet not that much has changed fundamentally over that time. Given the retail nature of the A-share market and the resulting wild swings in sentiment, this news has had a large impact on that sentiment. Ning argues that the market should recover over time, though: There will be underlying demand for A-shares as the market opens up (for example through the Shanghai \u2013 Hong Kong Stock Connect). These companies offer attractive growth opportunities and there are many companies which trade at attractive valuations which are not recognised by the market.\u201d Germany repatriated 120 tonnes of its gold back to the Bundesbank\u2019s vaults last year. The German central bank has just revealed that it \u201cstepped up\u201d its bullion transfers during 2014, bringing 35 tonnes of its gold from Paris and another 85 tonnes from New York. This is part of a scheme announced in 2013 to bring 674 tonnes, or half Germany\u2019s total stocks, back to Frankfurt by the end of the decade. Carl-Ludwig Thiele, Member of the Executive Board of the Deutsche Bundesbank, says: \u201cImplementation of our new gold storage plan is proceeding smoothly. Operations are running very much according to schedule.\u201d The gold transfers were launched after a German federal court ruled that officials should audit gold reserves held overseas; something the US Federal Reserve had been reluctant to allow.... If you want to really understand the implications of Switzerland dropping its euro peg, then check out this piece by economics professor Brad DeLong: Sokrates and Friends in Davos, or, the SNB and the Berne Whale: The Honest Broker The Swiss franc has been rather volatile this morning, as the Swiss National Bank\u2019s seismic decision to end its peg against the euro last week ripples through the markets. It\u2019s currently slightly weaker against the single currency, with one franc worth \u20ac0.9944, from \u20ac1.0092 last night. But that\u2019s still much stronger than the \u20ac0.83 which it was pegged at for three years. Although the tumbling Shanghai share prices has alarmed Chinese investors, it hasn\u2019t caused wider ripples through the markets. Indeed, European stocks have hit their highest level since 2007, with Germany\u2019s DAX gaining 0.3% to a new record high. The FTSE 100 is up 0.4%, or 25 points, at 6575. Money is also flowing into eurozone government debt, driven by speculation that the European Central Bank will launch a big sovereign bond-buying programme on Thursday. Stan Shamu of IG argues that Chinese regulators should be applauded: While this is putting a dent in equities in the near term, the intentions seem good as officials continue to reign in reforms and curb excessive speculation. Hao Hong, an analyst at BOCOM International, says China\u2019s clampdown on margin lending came as \u201ca nasty surprise\u201d to investors. And that means today\u2019s selloff could continue: \u201cWith less incremental liquidity flow into stocks and dampened sentiment, the market will correct in the near term, and the move can be violent.\u201d A swathe of Chinese stocks fell by the maximum amount allowed, during today\u2019s rout: While this chart shows how shares had surged in the last few months, helped by speculative activities such as margin trading: China\u2019s stock market has suffered its biggest one-day fall in over six years this morning, after regulators clamped down on risky investing practices. The Shanghai index tumbled by 7.7% to 3,355 points, the biggest one-day fall since June 2008. Several bank shares slumped by 10%, the maximum allowed. The sharp selloff was triggered by a crackdown on margin trading; where investors borrow money from their stock broker and use it to buy shares. The resulting leverage can give them big returns, but is also extremely risky. The China Securities Regulatory Commission announced on Friday that three large brokers \u2013 Citic Securities, Haitong Securities and Guotai Junan Securities \u2014 had been banned from opening new margin trading accounts for three months. The three firms had all broken regulations by allowing customers to roll over margin-trading contracts. Shares in Citic and Haitong both tumbled by 10% in early trading today. The Shanghai index had surged in recent months, up around 40% since November, triggering the CSRC to act. As Hao Hong, a strategist at Bocom International Holdings Co. in Hong Kong, explained to Bloomberg: \u201cRegulators are concerned that shares have run too hard, too fast\u201d. \u201cThey want a measured increase in the stock market. After all, margin financing is one of the reasons for people to be bullish on brokerage stocks, and these stocks have run particularly hard.\u201d More reaction to follow... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, business and finance. It\u2019s the start of a busy week. Investors are poised for Thursday\u2019s European Central Bank meeting, where Mario Draghi might finally announce a sovereign bond-buying programme. Anticipation of a big QE package has driven government bond yields to record highs, even though it\u2019s not a done deal yet. The ECB could yet announce a programme that\u2019s too small to stimulate inflation, leaving the markets disappointed. There\u2019s also a theory that it will force national central banks across the eurozone to stand behind their own sovereign bonds, to address German concerns that QE could expose taxpayers to huge losses. As Ian Williams of Peel Hunt explains: The moment of truth arrives on Thursday with the long-awaited January ECB meeting. The legal obstacles to implementation of a programme of sovereign bond purchases appear to have been cleared, so investors will expect Mr Draghi to confirm a detailed and decisive plan to head off further deflationary forces. The degree to which risk is allocated to national central banks may still cause some disagreement. Even a delivery of what the market wants may not fix the danger of dwindling inflation expectations, and political uncertainty in the region will continue to rumble along. For political uncertainty, read Greece. There\u2019s just six days to go until the country heads to the polls for a general election, with the left-wing Syriza party holding a steady lead. Investors are also still digesting last Thursday\u2019s shock decision by the Swiss central bank to stop pegging the Swiss franc to the euro. There\u2019s not much in the economic calendar. Germany\u2019s Bundesbank is due to release its latest monthly report this morning, and we also get eurozone current account data at 10am GMT. The US markets, though, will be closed for Martin Luther King day. We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day....",

      "bodyText": "The World Economic Forum has urged governments to measure minimum wages, trade union membership, investment in public services and corruption as part of an action plan for tackling rising inequality. Ahead of the start of its annual meeting in Davos on Tuesday, the WEF published 14 measures of inclusive growth as it responded to criticism that the gathering of 2,500 business leaders, academic and policymakers has become an exercise in hand-wringing about the gap between rich and poor. The Forum said there was a need to make the discussions about tackling inequality \u201cless vaguely aspirational\u201d in a policy paper that has co-incided with new research from Oxfam showing that on current trends the richest 1% of the world\u2019s population will by next year own more wealth than the other 99%. Between 2012 and 2014 growing inequality was identified by WEF members as the most likely threat to the global economy and the concerns have led to WEF staff drawing up ways of measuring policies that affect inclusiveness, including business ethics, social safety nets and the quality of basic infrastructure. \u201cSince the onset of the financial crisis, the question of how to unlock new sources of productive employment and strengthen the contribution of economic growth to progress in broad living standards has become an increasingly important concern for political and business leaders in developed and developing countries alike. These challenges have been at the top of the World Economic Forum Global Risks Report survey in recent years\u201d, the paper said. \u201cBut while there is widespread international consensus on the need to develop new and improved growth and development models in this respect, little in the way of concrete policy guidance has emerged. There is a growing need for analytical frameworks and evidence-based solutions suited to this purpose.\u201d Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the IMF, Pope Francis, Jim Kim, the president of the World Bank and Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, are among those who have stressed the need to ensure that the fruits of economic progress are shared more equally. Carney will be taking part in a panel in Davos this week titled: \u201cA richer world but for whom\u201d. Rick Samans, a member of the WEF board and a former economic adviser to Bill Clinton, said: \u201cThere is almost universal agreement about the direction that countries need to go in. It has almost become a mantra.

As a result Beales may be unable to generate sufficient cash flows to meet its financial commitments in the future. Therefore the board..intends to unanimously recommend that Beales shareholders accept the offer. It added that if Perloff successfully buys the business, he has committed to support the business with enough capital to improve its future security.

This is actually higher than the proportion of the managers and professionals in the total workforce, so it is a good time to be looking for work right now in that area. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"graph 6\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/iQhSE/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Would-be labourers, technicians and trade workers or machinery operators and drivers, however, will find the going rather tougher. While they account for 31% of all currently employed, they only accounted for 25% of all job vacancies in November. This would suggest that opportunities for work in such occupations are not growing and that in the future there will likely be fewer such jobs than there is now.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://employment.gov.au/department-employment-s-leading-indicator-employment-latest-release\">Department of Employment\u2019s leading indicator of employment</a> fell in January, making it 12 consecutive months without a rise \u2013 the longest such run since 2003. The department suggests that this \u201cindicates that employment growth is likely to be below its long-term trend growth rate of 1.2% in coming months\u201d.</p> <p>So the fight for jobs looks set to continue and, alas, despite a nice improvement in some measures of the unemployment rate, it doesn\u2019t look to be getting easier anytime soon. </p>",

But in South Australia\u2019s case it can partly be explained through a decline in its participation rate \u2013 people have in effect found the fight to get a job so hard they have given up and are no longer actively looking for work. But that fight remains a damn hard one. In South Australia, for example, in November last year there were a quarter fewer job vacancies than there were in November 2009 \u2013 when the nation was still in the midst of the GFC. Remember, of course, that these job vacancy figures are also just averages \u2013 they don\u2019t give us an indicator of what type of jobs are on offer. The Department of Employment\u2019s monthly vacancy report shows that of the job vacancies in November, a quarter were for professionals and 13% for managers. This is actually higher than the proportion of the managers and professionals in the total workforce, so it is a good time to be looking for work right now in that area. Would-be labourers, technicians and trade workers or machinery operators and drivers, however, will find the going rather tougher. While they account for 31% of all currently employed, they only accounted for 25% of all job vacancies in November. This would suggest that opportunities for work in such occupations are not growing and that in the future there will likely be fewer such jobs than there is now. The Department of Employment\u2019s leading indicator of employment fell in January, making it 12 consecutive months without a rise \u2013 the longest such run since 2003. The department suggests that this \u201cindicates that employment growth is likely to be below its long-term trend growth rate of 1.2% in coming months\u201d. So the fight for jobs looks set to continue and, alas, despite a nice improvement in some measures of the unemployment rate, it doesn\u2019t look to be getting easier anytime soon.",

      "bodyText": "The UK economy is a clear winner from the collapse in oil prices, which has delivered a \u201cshot in the spending arm\u201d for consumers, according to a leading economic forecaster. Lower oil prices will keep the cost of the average shopping basket flat in 2015, putting more money in consumer pockets and driving economic growth higher than expected, the EY Item Club said in its winter forecast. Peter Spencer, chief economic adviser, said: \u201cThe UK consumer has been lashed by rising fuel and food prices for so long, but is now the major beneficiary as these pull back. Individuals can look forward to a substantial increase in real earnings.\u201d He said the boost from the falling oil price was timely, coming just as the UK recovery appeared to be losing momentum. The Item Club expects growth to accelerate to 2.9% this year, after 2.6% growth last year. Back in October, before the drop in oil prices was so sharp, it was forecasting slower growth of 2.4% for 2015. The slump, with prices down by about 60% since last summer to less than $50 (\u00a333) a barrel, is starting to feed through to UK petrol pumps. Consumers are also benefiting from lower food costs, partly driven by a fierce price war among the UK\u2019s top supermarkets. Food prices fell by 1.9% in the year to December, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). With inflation forecast to average zero this year, Item predicted the Bank of England will leave interest rates on hold at an all-time low of 0.5% until the first quarter of 2016, further helping household finances. Real disposable incomes, those adjusted for inflation, are forecast to increase by 3.7%. Annual house price growth is expected to slow to 7.1% this year, from 10% last year. Item said that while British businesses \u2013 particularly consumer facing companies \u2013 might do better this year than they originally expected, there were still risks to the outlook. \u201cPossible shocks from developments in the eurozone, the general election and business-specific risks such as changes in China \u2013 if this is a major destination for sales \u2013 must be taken into account,\u201d said Mark Gregory, EY\u2019s chief economist. Item said falling oil prices were a positive offset to weak UK exports, but they were extending the country\u2019s dependence on the property market, leaving the economy \u201cseriously unbalanced\u201d. The government has argued thatgreater reliance on manufacturing and exports and less on consumer spending would put the future of the UK economy on a more sustainable footing.",

      "bodyText": "The economy is recovering in London \u201cbut not here\u201d. Outside the circumference of the M25 you are likely to hear that familiar refrain. The further away from London you go the louder it gets. There has been concern about the north-south divide for at least a century, since the industries that created Britain\u2019s industrial dominance in the 19th century, that of cotton, coal and shipbuilding, went into decline. Ever since, politicians have been trying to find a way of reversing the relative decline of the north. They have offered public money to persuade firms to move from London; they have relocated government functions to the regions; they have wooed inward investment; they have created regional development agencies; they have asked local authorities to compete for pots of public money; they have announced plans to improve infrastructure. And, even though all regions are currently growing, the problem remains. Take these three quotes, one each from the Conservatives, Labour and the Liberal Democrats and see if you can tell which is which: \u201cWe need to rebalance our economy away from its over-reliance on London and the south-east\u201d. And: \u201cFor far too long the economies of too many regions and countries of the UK have been allowed to fall behind.\u201d Last: \u201cToday our economy is heavily reliant on just a few industries and a few regions, particularly London and the south-east.\u201d Pretty hard, isn\u2019t it? For the record, the first quote is from Nick Clegg, speaking in 2013. The second is from Gordon Brown and Patricia Hewitt launching a Treasury paper in 2001. The third is from David Cameron\u2019s first speech as prime minister in May 2010. So, everybody agrees that there is a problem. Everybody agrees that something needs to be done about it. But as the latest research from the Centre for Cities shows quite clearly, finding the solution has proved tricky. The thinktank looked at trends in population, business creation, jobs and housing in more than 60 cities, over a 10-year period from 2004 to 2013, spanning years when the economy was growing strongly, when it was in deep recession, and when it was on the mend. Its conclusion was stark. \u201cDespite a consistent political commitment from all parties to improve the relative economic performance of places outside of the south, the gap between cities in the south and cities in the rest of the UK has increased, not diminished.\u201d The populations of cities over the past 10 years have increased across all of the UK, but cities in the south have grown at twice the rate of cities elsewhere: 11.3% against 5.5%. This is hardly surprising given that business growth was more rapid in the south. In 2013, there were 26.8% more businesses in southern cities than 10 years earlier, compared with a 13.7% rise in the rest of the UK. The divide was even more pronounced when it came to jobs. For every 12 net additional jobs that were created in the south, just one was created elsewhere. Milton Keynes, London, Cambridge, Brighton and Bournemouth had the biggest percentage increases in jobs. The worst performing city or town was Gloucester, followed by Rochdale, Blackpool, Newport and Hull. In all of these the number of jobs decreased from 2004 to 2013. This, though, understates the challenge because much of the jobs growth in cities outside the south, while the last Labour government was in power, came in the public sector, a source of employment no longer available since the spending cuts. Cities in the south have been able to cope better with the loss of public-sector jobs because there were 12.6% more private-sector posts in 2013 than there were in 2004. In the rest of the UK there was a 1.1% decline in private-sector posts, with double-digit falls in Gloucester, Blackpool, Hull, Rochdale, Newport, Burnley and Huddersfield. You don\u2019t need to be a genius to work out what stronger population growth, higher rates of business creation and greater job opportunities in the southern cities add up to: pressure on housing. In 2004, the average house in a city in the south was nine times average earnings. By 2014 that had become 14 times the average wage. Elsewhere, there was no change in affordability, with the average home costing 6.7 times earnings in 2013. So that\u2019s the extent of the challenge. The free-market approach has failed. Prosperity has not flowed back to the regions merely due to the workings of the price mechanism. The centralised, target-driven approach has failed. Getting local authorities to compete for little pots of money chiselled out of the Treasury has failed. The north-south divide is as big as it ever was. There are, though, some reasons to be cheerful. First, there is now broad recognition that something different is needed. Second, lessons have been learned from London, where the creation of the Greater London authority led by a directly elected mayor proved a success. Third, the fact that the Whitehall money hose has run dry has encouraged creative thinking. Fourth, the promise that further powers will be devolved to Scotland after the closely fought referendum campaign has inevitably led to those running the big northern cities demanding similar degrees of autonomy. Finally, there has been some political accommodation. It has suited the Conservatives and the Labour-run councils in northern cities to work together: the Tories want to show that they have something to offer beyond the shires and suburbs; the councils get to run more of their own affairs. George Osborne\u2019s plans for a northern powerhouse and the agreement he has struck to devolve power and funding to Greater Manchester is a sign of that. Of all these factors, the most important has been the Scottish referendum. Britain stands out among industrial nations for its centralisation of power and the control freakery exhibited by its finance ministry. The prospect of the UK breaking up forced the British state to do what it has always been most reluctant to do: to trust people at a local level to have a bigger say over how they raise and spend money. As things stand, the financial constraints on local government in England will remain much stronger than in Scotland. This is irrational and unsustainable. As the Centre for Cities notes: \u201cIf cities across the country are to make bigger contributions to the UK economy\u2019s future growth, then they will need more control over their tax base.\u201d For more than half a century, regional policy has been based on the idea that the man in Whitehall knows best. That idea has been tested to destruction.",
