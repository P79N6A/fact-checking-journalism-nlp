      "bodyText": "Excessive risk taking and geopolitical hazards pose new threats to a global economy already experiencing an uneven and weaker than expected recovery, the International Monetary Fund has warned. In an assessment prepared for finance ministers and central bank governors of the G20 countries, the Washington-based fund said problems in the US, the eurozone, China, Japan, Russia and Latin America meant growth would not meet the 3.6% pencilled in for 2014 in April. The IMF said it expected the world economy to pick up speed during 2015 because long-term interest rates were low, central banks were supporting activity and share prices were rising. But it issued a warning that new threats could be building even before the global economy had recovered fully from its biggest downturn since the Great Depression of the 1930s. \"New downside risks associated with geopolitical tensions and increasing risk taking are arising,\" the IMF said. It said other risks stemmed from low inflation, a permanent slowdown in growth rates in the west, lower growth in emerging economies and the possible disruption to financial markets that might be caused when the US Federal Reserve starts to raise interest rates. \"Despite setbacks this year, global recovery is proceeding but remains unbalanced,\" the paper on global prospects and challenges said. \"In many advanced economies legacies of the boom and subsequent crisis \u2013 including high private and public debt \u2013 still weigh on the recovery despite relaxed financial conditions.\" It added that activity had picked up after a sluggish start to 2014, \"but it has been uneven and weaker than expected in the April World Economic Outlook. Growth rebounded in the US but fell short of expectations in the euro area and Japan.\" The fund expects the US to do best in 2015, with growth forecast to remain \"solid\" in the UK, Australia, Canada and other Asian advanced economies. But, despite action by the European Central Bank to lift activity through cuts in interest rates and credit-boosting measures, the fund believes eurozone growth will rise \"more gradually and unevenly\". The US and the UK are predicted to be the fastest growing of the major G7 western economies in 2014 and 2015, and the fund said policymakers in Washington and London should be preparing to remove the ultra-stimulative policies in place for more than five years. It said the main challenge in the US was to judge the appropriate speed at which monetary policy \u2013 interest rates and the asset purchase programme known as quantitative easing \u2013 should return to normal, given the state of the economy and the impact of higher interest rates on consumers and businesses. \"Current plans to end tapering later this year and increase policy rates from the middle of next year appear appropriate, given the sizable slack,\" the report said. The IMF said UK interest rates should stay at their record low of 0.5% \"for now\", but borrowing costs might need to be tightened quickly if costs ran ahead of productivity growth, spare capacity was absorbed faster than expected, or if the Bank of England's new macro-prudential tools did not cope with rising house prices.",

      "bodyText": "JD Sports Fashion is stepping up overseas expansion plans after doubling profits for the second year in a row, thanks to high demand for in-house brands such as Duffer of St George and exclusive versions of branded trainers. Pre-tax profits rose to nearly \u00a320m as sales shot up 27% to \u00a3721m in the six months to the beginning of August. Within the group, JD Sports was top performer, with sales up 28%, while sales also rose at outdoors chains Blacks and Millets.

      "bodyText": "Up to 800 Phones 4u staff are to keep their jobs after Dixons Carphone received the all-clear to offer jobs to workers who had been operating mobile phone concessions in its PC World and Currys outlets. A further 4,200 jobs remain at risk after Phones 4u fell into administration on Monday. Administrators at PricewaterhouseCoopers have said there is enough cash to pay staff for another day and they could begin to lay off workers and permanently shut down parts of the business from Thursday if buyers for all or part of the business are not found. The three administrators are talking with potential buyers for some of the group's 550 stores, including mobile operators EE and Vodafone, which have been accused of forcing the demise of Phones 4u by withdrawing their business from the chain. The concessions in a further 160 PC World and Currys stores ceased trading and reverted to the newly merged Dixons Carphone group when Phones 4u collapsed. The retailer said it wanted to take on all its staff and reopen as soon as possible. The concessions are likely to be rebranded under the Carphone name over time but PwC made clear the agreement with Dixons Carphone did not include the sale of stock or the Phones 4u brand name. It is understood the retailer has about 300,000 handsets in stock, which the administrators will either sell or return to manufacturers. Phones 4u's demise has also left customers unsure about their rights. The retailer's insurance arm also fell into administration on Wednesday with the same team from PwC taking on the job. A spokesman said all policies were safe and claims would continue to be handled but there would be a short delay in processing them because of shop closures. Dan Schwarzmann, joint administrator and PwC partner, said: \"We would like to reassure all policyholders with an active Phones 4u Care or Premierplan mobile phone insurance policy that your policy remains in force in accordance with its terms and conditions.\" Phones 4u Care customers can call a dedicated hotline, 0333-222 6730, for further information. Administrators said they were continuing to engage with a number of parties \u2013 likely to include coffee shops, e-cigarette sellers and nail bars, which operate from similar-sized outlets \u2013 about the future of Phones 4u's stores. EE and Vodafone are also looking at buying up to several dozen of Phones 4u's standalone stores. The closure of all Phones 4U's outlets earlier this week is the biggest one-day shut-down of a chain since Woolworths collapsed in 2008 according to high street analysts Local Data Company. Vodafone and EE were accused on Monday of playing a central role in Phones 4u's downfall. The company's private equity owner, BC Partners, said Vodafone had behaved in a way \"designed to inflict the maximum damage\" on Phones 4u while it described EE's decision to withdraw its business from Phones 4u last week as surprising. Phones 4u sells mobile-phone contracts and handsets to consumers on behalf of operators but its business model has been irreparably damaged by networks deciding to open own-branded outlets instead. In an outspoken attack on Monday, Phones 4u's founder, John Caudwell, blamed the company's demise on its owners and former partners. \"It's astonishingly ruthless. Vodafone have had millions upon millions from Phones 4u over 25 years. It's dreadful for British business. Sources close to one of the mobile operators said that they had made clear for some time that they were reviewing their relationship with Phones 4U and discussions had broken down after the retailer refused to offer improved terms on a historic agreement. Meanwhile a group of Phones4U bondholders said they would look into launching a rescue plan for the company. A spokeswoman for the bondholders said: \"We have proposed a restructure of the business that means the capital structure will no longer be an impediment to achieving the commercial outcome which allows the company to continue as a going concern.\"",

      "body": "<p>The arrest of one of Russia's richest men, whose empire spans oil production to the country's largest mobile phone network, could send further shockwaves through an economy already reeling from western&#xa0;sanctions.</p> <p>Analysts said the moves against Vladimir Yevtushenkov this week looked like a raid on his business by Kremlin-connected forces, and were a sign of an intensifying battle for a \"shrinking pie\" of resources. Yevtushenkov, Russia's 15th richest businessman with a fortune of around \u00a35.5bn according to Forbes magazine, has been placed under house arrest after allegations of money laundering.</p> <p>A report in the Izvestiya newspaper said prison officials visited Yevtushenkov's mansion outside Moscow and fitted an electronic bracelet around his ankle. He is banned from leaving his home, speaking with anyone except his lawyers, and using the telephone or internet.</p> <p>Yevtushenkov's holding company, Sistema, whose board directors include the Labour peer Lord Mandelson, saw its shares slump 38% by Wednesday afternoon. The allegations against the billionaire relate to the purchase of Bashneft, one of the few privately owned oil companies in Russia, in 2009. Sistema also controls MTS, a mobile network operating in Russia and many post-Soviet nations.</p> <p>There were suggestions that Rosneft, the state-controlled oil company run by Igor Sechin, a close associate of President Vladimir Putin, wants to buy out Bashneft. The arrest brought accusations from the fallen oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky, released from prison by Putin last year, that the move was linked to Kremlin interest in Yevtushenkov's oil assets.</p> <p>Khodorkovsky was arrested in 2003, spent years in jail, and his oil company Yukos was disbanded, much of it snapped up by Rosneft. The company dismissed Khodorkovsky's comments as absurd.</p> <p>Sergei Aleksashenko, an economist and former deputy finance minister, said there was no political subtext to the decision, but framed it as a simple economic raid in order to snap up the company.</p> <p>\"This is not even a racket, this is simple, undisguised theft,\" he wrote in a blog post. \"The item that the thieves are interested in is there for all to see. An oil company in Russia is too much of an attractive business for those close to power not to get interested in. Who are they in this case? We will soon find out, right at the moment when Bashneft changes its owner. This will happen, I have no doubt.\"</p> <p>Aleksashenko said there were two choices for Yevtushenkov: sell up quickly and flee the country, in the mould of the former mobile phone magnate Yevgeny Chichvarkin who now runs a wine shop in London, or go down the path of Khodorkovsky and possibly end up in&#xa0;prison.</p> <p>Chichvarkin said he believed powerful Kremlin figures were behind the move against Yevtushenkov and expected there would be more to follow.</p> <p>\"Maybe they first made him an offer of 10% of what it's worth and then when he said no they decided to escalate,\" he said, speaking from London. \"It's absolutely clear that the ideal scenario for them is for him to flee and sell all his remaining companies. MTS would be a really juicy prize. He has the choice of fleeing and selling or something much worse.\"</p> <p>Alexander Shokhin, the normally cautious head of Russia's largest business union, said the move \"looked like Yukos&#xa0;2.0\" and would damage trust in the Russian business climate.</p> <p>Anatoly Chubais, the head of Russian state-owned nanotechnology agency Rusnano and a major political figure during the 1990s, told Interfax that he did not understand the charges against Yevtushenkov. \"What I can understand is that these actions will cause a very serious blow to the Russian business climate, at a time when the Russian economy is balancing on the edge of recession and stagnation,\" he said.</p> <p>What will be particularly worrying for Russia's businessmen is that Yevtushenkov, unlike Khodorkovsky, was in no way a political figure. Khodorkovsky was widely regarded as challenging the unwritten rule that Putin imposed on the oligarchs when he took over: stay out of politics and you can keep your fortunes. The Yukos head began to finance opposition political parties and complained about official corruption at Kremlin meetings; his opponents in the Kremlin saw the chance to move against him.</p> <p>Yevtushenkov worked for the Moscow city government during the collapse of the Soviet Union and in 1993 set up Sistema with a group of partners. Like many oligarchs early in their careers, the business began with the import of computers, as well as selling Russian oil abroad.</p> <p>Yevtushenkov was known as an ally of Yuri Luzhkov, Moscow's long-standing mayor, who ran the Russian capital between 1992 and 2010, when he was deposed. However, the tycoon did not dabble in politics and was thought of as a purposefully neutral, apolitical figure.</p> <p>Chichvarkin said it was the latest in a set of cases against businessmen in Russia, starting with Khodorkovsky, and showed that everyone still operating in the country was at risk.</p> <p>\"There have already been so many signals in the past years that it is difficult to think that new signals would work on Russian businessmen, but this certainly shows that however loyal you are, however far from politics you are, if they want to take your business they will, because they are greedy bandits.\"</p> <p>In June, in an interview with Russian Forbes magazine, Yevtushenkov himself noted the huge risks involved in dealing with the post-Soviet markets. MTS was forced to write off huge losses in Uzbekistan after several local managers were accused of wrongdoing, in a case that Sistema always claimed was politically motivated. He said, however, there were no markets that could be seen as risk-free in the region.</p> <p>\"When you operate in strategic sectors, you should be certain that the state knows you, is loyal to you, and wants you to be there \u2026 because any state can always find a way to put you in your place, however strong you are internationally, and whatever businesses you run.\"</p> <p>A spokesperson for Sistema declined to comment on the case.</p>",

Sergei Aleksashenko, an economist and former deputy finance minister, said there was no political subtext to the decision, but framed it as a simple economic raid in order to snap up the company. \"This is not even a racket, this is simple, undisguised theft,\" he wrote in a blog post. \"The item that the thieves are interested in is there for all to see. An oil company in Russia is too much of an attractive business for those close to power not to get interested in. Who are they in this case? We will soon find out, right at the moment when Bashneft changes its owner. This will happen, I have no doubt.\" Aleksashenko said there were two choices for Yevtushenkov: sell up quickly and flee the country, in the mould of the former mobile phone magnate Yevgeny Chichvarkin who now runs a wine shop in London, or go down the path of Khodorkovsky and possibly end up in prison. Chichvarkin said he believed powerful Kremlin figures were behind the move against Yevtushenkov and expected there would be more to follow. \"Maybe they first made him an offer of 10% of what it's worth and then when he said no they decided to escalate,\" he said, speaking from London. \"It's absolutely clear that the ideal scenario for them is for him to flee and sell all his remaining companies. MTS would be a really juicy prize. He has the choice of fleeing and selling or something much worse.\" Alexander Shokhin, the normally cautious head of Russia's largest business union, said the move \"looked like Yukos 2.0\" and would damage trust in the Russian business climate. Anatoly Chubais, the head of Russian state-owned nanotechnology agency Rusnano and a major political figure during the 1990s, told Interfax that he did not understand the charges against Yevtushenkov. \"What I can understand is that these actions will cause a very serious blow to the Russian business climate, at a time when the Russian economy is balancing on the edge of recession and stagnation,\" he said. What will be particularly worrying for Russia's businessmen is that Yevtushenkov, unlike Khodorkovsky, was in no way a political figure. Khodorkovsky was widely regarded as challenging the unwritten rule that Putin imposed on the oligarchs when he took over: stay out of politics and you can keep your fortunes. The Yukos head began to finance opposition political parties and complained about official corruption at Kremlin meetings; his opponents in the Kremlin saw the chance to move against him. Yevtushenkov worked for the Moscow city government during the collapse of the Soviet Union and in 1993 set up Sistema with a group of partners. Like many oligarchs early in their careers, the business began with the import of computers, as well as selling Russian oil abroad. Yevtushenkov was known as an ally of Yuri Luzhkov, Moscow's long-standing mayor, who ran the Russian capital between 1992 and 2010, when he was deposed. However, the tycoon did not dabble in politics and was thought of as a purposefully neutral, apolitical figure. Chichvarkin said it was the latest in a set of cases against businessmen in Russia, starting with Khodorkovsky, and showed that everyone still operating in the country was at risk. \"There have already been so many signals in the past years that it is difficult to think that new signals would work on Russian businessmen, but this certainly shows that however loyal you are, however far from politics you are, if they want to take your business they will, because they are greedy bandits.\" In June, in an interview with Russian Forbes magazine, Yevtushenkov himself noted the huge risks involved in dealing with the post-Soviet markets. MTS was forced to write off huge losses in Uzbekistan after several local managers were accused of wrongdoing, in a case that Sistema always claimed was politically motivated. He said, however, there were no markets that could be seen as risk-free in the region. \"When you operate in strategic sectors, you should be certain that the state knows you, is loyal to you, and wants you to be there \u2026 because any state can always find a way to put you in your place, however strong you are internationally, and whatever businesses you run.\" A spokesperson for Sistema declined to comment on the case.",

The UK however slipped back, unsettled by the uncertainties of Thursday\u2019s vote on Scottish independence. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished 11.34 points or 0.17% lower at 6780.90 Germany\u2019s Dax added 0.3% to 9661.50 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.5% better at 4431.41 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB added 1.55% to 21,111.66 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 1.01% better at 10,907.4 On Wall Street, ahead of the Federal Reserve announcement, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up just 5 points or 0.03%. On that note, it\u2019s time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments. The latest Scottish referendum poll showing the No camp - slightly - in the lead but the Yes vote gaining ground: OK, time to recap. The recovery in the UK\u2019s labour market has continued, with the unemployment rate falling to its lowest level since the end of 2008. The UK jobless rate dropped to 6.2% in the May-July quarter, down from 6.4% last month. The number of people in employment increased by 74,000 during the three months, to 30.61 million, while the number of unemployed people fell by 146,000 to 2.02 million. And the claimant count, for August, fell below the one million mark for the first time since Lehman Brothers collapsed six years ago. But real wages continue to lag inflation, with average earnings (ex bonuses) rising just 0.7% annually. Union leaders warn that this wage squeeze cannot continue, after years of falling real incomes. TUC chief Frances O\u2019Grady says: \u201cLast week the Governor of the Bank of England said the fall in real wages is the worst since the 1920s and today\u2019s figures show it getting worse. Pay increases are less than half the rate of inflation, so living standards keep on falling. \u201cMore people are working, but growth based on more low-paid jobs isn\u2019t working for Britain. We need jobs that ensure everyone gets a fair share in the growing economy through real increases to their wages.\u201d Government ministers took a more positive line, with prime minister David Cameron hailing the \u201cremarkable\u201d progress made over the last year. Here are the key charts. Here\u2019s Larry Elliott\u2019s news story and analysis: Wages will not rise until employers have to compete for talent UK unemployment rate lowest since 2008 crash Elsewhere... The pound has rallied ahead of tomorrow\u2019s Scottish referendum, after the latest polls showed a four-point lead for the No side. That also pushed Spanish bond yields down. There\u2019s mixed news on global inflation. The eurozone is not as close to deflation as feared, after eurostat revised its data. Prices rose by 0.4% annually in August, not 0.3% as first estimated. But prices fell month-on-month in America, pulling its inflation rate down to 1.7%. And European car sales have now risen for the 12th month running, although France still looks weak... The Scottish referendum seems to be having an effect on markets beyond the UK. Spanish bonds have just strengthened to their higher level of the day after the Panelbase poll put the No side ahead. That pushed the yield, or interest rate, on 10-year Spanish bonds down to 2.27%, from 2.35% yesterday. That reflects speculation that Catalonia\u2019s independence movement could receive a boost if Scotland breaks away from the UK. Adam Posen, a former member of the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee, has hit out at fellow economist Joseph Stiglitz for being, in his view, too blas\u00e9 over the consequences of independence. Posen has blogged that the reality of independence is \u201cfrightening\u201d. He predicted that trade with rUK would suffer badly if Scotland broke away, even if it used the pound. Leaving the United Kingdom will be a huge blow to Scottish commerce. Posen also argued that Scotland\u2019s role as an independent country would be particularly challenging as it would probably have to join the euro zone. If Scotland wishes to be part of the European Union as a sovereign nation, however, by international treaty, it has to adopt the euro. By adopting the euro, which has a Germanic business cycle focus, the Scottish economy will be repeatedly more out of sync with policy than in the United Kingdom, promoting boom/busts. But Scotland would first have to get over the long list of economic and institutional hurdles required by treaty to be admitted to the euro area\u2014which is a multiyear period of great vulnerability, as Greece and Italy experienced in the 1990s. Here\u2019s the full piece: Rebuttal to Stiglitz on Scotland: Reality of Independence Is Frightening The pound has pushed a little higher, after a new Scottish opinion poll also reported the No side leading the Yes side by 4 percentage points. It\u2019s now up 0.5%, or three-quarters of a cent, at $1.6351. The Conservative Party has fallen foul of the campaign to prevent wanton abuse of the y-axis on economic charts: More dramatic if you don\u2019t start from zero, but also less accurate... Putting today\u2019s unemployment rate in some historical contect: The surprise drop in US inflation today means the Federal Reserve is less likely to drop its guidance that interest rates will remain low for a \u201cconsiderable time\u201d after its QE programme ends (likely in October) The Fed will release a statement at 7pm BST (2pm Eastern), which will be scrutinised for language changes. Paul Dales of Capital Economics says: The further softening in US price pressures evident in August\u2019s CPI data ease the pressure on the Fed to amend its \u201cconsiderable time\u201d rate pledge at today\u2019s policy meeting And Rob Carnell of ING reckons the Fed will only make a small amendment: We suspect that any such changes will be small, most likely, a tweak to the text referring to the time after QE ends before the first rate hike. Perhaps a replacement of the word \u201cconsiderable\u201d, in this context. Aha, here\u2019s a snap of the prime minister meeting workers at the Weir Minerals factory near Yateley, where he described today\u2019s unemployment figures as \u2018remarkable\u2019. Here\u2019s the details of the surprise drop in US inflation: Just in: consumer prices in America have fallen for the first time in 16 months. The monthly CPI index showed that prices fell by 0.2% compared with July. That dragged the annual US inflation date down to 1.7%, surprising Wall Street which expected 1.9%. Energy prices fell by 2.4% in the month, including a 4.1% slide in gasoline prices. The fall in inflation helped to swell US real incomes during the month. Quite a comparison with the UK (see chart at 1201pm) The underlying reason that UK firms aren\u2019t offering inflation-busting pay rises is that they simply don\u2019t have to. Despite the dramatic improvements in the jobless rate over the last year, employees don\u2019t, yet, seem able to demand higher wages for their services. That\u2019s not true everywhere -- construction firms, for example, have been reporting skills shortages, which inevitably puts more power in the hands of the workers. But elsewhere, employers are still calling the shots, reflecting how the labour market has changed in recent decades. Our economics editor Larry Elliott writes: The first is that the old relationship whereby falling jobless numbers led to employers being forced to pay more for a shrinking pool of talent has broken down. Weaker trade unions, less collective bargaining, an increase in the percentage of the workforce that is part-time or self-employed: these are all factors keeping the lid on wage increases. Eventually, the traditional pattern will re-emerge. At some point, unemployment will fall to a level that does lead to such intense competiton for labour that the balance of power in wage negotiations will shift. But the current data suggests we are not at that point yet.... Here\u2019s Larry\u2019s full analysis: Wages will not rise until employers have to compete for talent Back in the markets, the pound remains higher today; currently up almost half a cent at $1.632. The leader of the Green party in England and Wales, Natalie Bennett, blames the government for Britain\u2019s shrinking real wages: David Cameron, whose mind must be whirling as the Scottish vote nears, has welcomed the drop in unemployment and taken some credit for it: PA has the details: During a visit to Weir Minerals Europe, a factory near Fleet in Hampshire, Prime Minister David Cameron described the fall in people claiming unemployment benefit as \u201creally remarkable\u201d. He added: \u201cWe had a long-term economic plan, we stuck to that plan and you can see today that plan is working.\u201d But Mr Cameron said they have not finished yet and have \u201ca lot more work to do\u201d. That largely echoes George Osborne\u2019s tweets this mornings. The CBI, which represents British businesses, is dangling the prospect of wage increases picking up: \u201cWith unemployment dropping, and wage settlements in larger firms starting to pick up, we expect to see average earnings growth begin to rise in time.\u201d And this chart shows how average UK pay rises have lagged inflation for most months since the financial crisis struck. The TUC\u2019s concerns about low wage growth are also shared by Mark Miller of the Economist Intelligence Unit. He reckons that it will deter the Bank of England from raising interest rates in the next six months. Miller writes: \u201cIn itself, the decline in unemployment of 146,000 during May-July 2014 compared with the previous quarter is clearly encouraging. But further tightening in labour market conditions is still not being reflected in firmer pay growth. Latest average weekly earnings growth data (both whole economy and excluding bonuses) remain very subdued in historical terms. This remains a key focus at the Bank of England and accordingly, we do not envisage a first interest rate increase before the second quarter of 2015.\u201d Union leaders are adamant that the labour market is not yet healed, despite seeing the headline unemployment rate hit a near-six year low. Frances O\u2019Grady, TUC General Secretary, hammers home that workers have seen their pay packets eaten away by inflation over the last four years. They are still suffering falling real wages today, given that regular pay rose by just 0.7% year-on-year in May-July, when inflation was as high as 1.9%. O\u2019Grady says: \u201cLast week the Governor of the Bank of England said the fall in real wages is the worst since the 1920s and today\u2019s figures show it getting worse. Pay increases are less than half the rate of inflation, so living standards keep on falling. \u201cMore people are working, but growth based on more low-paid jobs isn\u2019t working for Britain. We need jobs that ensure everyone gets a fair share in the growing economy through real increases to their wages.\u201d And this issue is also concerning PwC, the consultancy group. Their chief economist, John Hawksworth, says the shrinking real wages mean many people have missed out on the full benefit of the recovery. Here\u2019s his take: \u201cToday\u2019s data shows that regular pay growth remains very subdued at just 0.7% despite continued strong jobs growth, although the squeeze on real earnings has eased slightly with the recent fall in consumer price inflation to 1.5%. But to many workers facing a sixth consecutive year of declining real wages, the recovery may still seem to be something that is happening to other people. \u201cWeak pay growth appears to reflect increased labour supply in recent years, notably by older workers and immigrants, which has balanced the effect of increased labour demand. More recently, it also reflects compositional effects due to the return to the workforce of some previously unemployed or inactive younger workers with relatively low pay and productivity levels. Here\u2019s economics editor Larry Elliott on today\u2019s jobs data: Unemployment in the UK has dropped to its lowest level since the height of the 2008 financial crisis as a growing economy creates more part-time jobs, according to official figures. Both government measures of joblessness are falling, although data from the Office for National Statistics hinted that the improvement in the labour market could be slowing. The labour force survey measure of unemployment, an internationally-agreed yardstick, declined by 146,000 in the three months to July, taking the total to 2.02 million. Over the past year, unemployment has dropped by 468,000, the largest annual fall since the so-called Lawson boom in 1988. The rate fell more sharply than expected, with the drop from 6.4% to 6.2% taking it to levels not seen for almost six years..... Full story: UK unemployment rate falls to lowest level since 2008 financial crisis The ONS also has an \u2018unofficial\u2019 stab at the unemployment rate for July alone, rather than for the May-July quarter. And it shows that the jobless rate hit just 5.9%, suggesting the headline rate will keep falling for the next couple of months. Rob Wood, economist at Berenberg, flags up that underemployment appears to have fallen: Underemployment is falling too. It is not just the headline unemployment figures that are showing significant change. Underemployment is one possible reason why wages have remained weak, but the signs are that it is declining quickly. The proportion of part time workers who wanted but could not find a full-time job has fallen from 18.4% to 16.5% in the past year, for instanc Labour MP Stephen Timms, the shadow Employment Minister, says that today\u2019s fall in overall unemployment is \u201cwelcome\u201d, but is also concerned that pay is still falling behind the cost of living (see chart at 10.01am). Employment consultant Dr John Philpott reckons \u201cthere are tentative signs in the latest figures that the balance between job creation and pay growth may have started to shift.\u201d Today\u2019s data shows that the workforce expanded by 74,000 in May-July, the small increase in just over a year. Here\u2019s an important point: the number of people who aren\u2019t in the UK labour market has increased, reversing a recent trend. The ONS reports that the \u201ceconomic inactivity rate\u201d in May-July was 22.1%, up from 21.8% in February to April. That measure the percentage of the population who could potentially be in the workforce, but are not (including full-time students). That increase will have helped to drag down the jobless rate from 6.4% to the near six-year low of 6.2%. As this chart shows, the economic inactivity rate had spiked when the financial crisis began, but had fallen pretty steadily since. The chancellor has been tweeting: The claimant count has also hit a milestone. The number of people receiving unemployment benefit fell to 966,500 in August, the first time it\u2019s been below one million since 2008. Back to the UK unemployment data, and today\u2019s data also shows that there has been a sharp rise in self-employment. Over the last year: The number of self-employed people working full-time increased by 225,000 to reach 3.24 million. The number of self-employed people working part-time increased by 143,000 to reach 1.30 million. The number of unpaid family workers increased by 13,000 to reach 119,000. Good news, the eurozone isn\u2019t quite as close to the quagmire of deflation as feared. The eurozone inflation rate for August has been revised up, to +0.4% annually, from 0.3%, thanks to faster rising prices in the service sector. That\u2019s still alarmingly low, though. And this chart shows that real wages are still falling, based on the 0.7% rise in basic pay in today\u2019s report. Britain is now close to its highest ever employment rate, set in 1974. Men make up a narrow majority of the new entries to the labour market in the last year. And most have taken on full-time jobs, unlike women, who are split between full-time and part-time positions: And this shows how the US and UK labour markets have recovered over the last two years, while Europe is struggling to bring down its record unemployment levels in the face of austerity. Here\u2019s the details of how the UK labour market changed over the last quarter: the number of people in employment increased by 74,000 (to 30.61 million), the number of unemployed people fell by 146,000 (to 2.02 million), and the number of people aged from 16 to 64 who were out of work but not seeking or available to work (economically inactive) increased by 114,000 (to 8.93 million). There are signs that Britain\u2019s pay squeeze may be easing, but we\u2019re not there yet. The ONE reports that pay including bonuses for employees in Great Britain was 0.6% higher than a year earlier in the May-July period. A month ago, it shank by 0.2%. And regular pay, excluding bonuses, was 0.7% higher than a year earlier. That\u2019s up from 0.6% in April-June. Encouraging, but that still means that pay packets are shrinking in real terms. Inflation is currently running at 1.5%. The Office for National Statistics says: The main findings of this release are that employment continued to rise and unemployment continued to fall. These changes continue the general direction of movement since late 2011/early 2012. The report is online here. The number of people receiving unemployment benefit has fallen again; down 37,000 in August. Breaking: The UK unemployment rate has fallen to 6.2% in the May-July quarter, down from 6.4% a month ago. That\u2019s the lowest jobless rate since the September-November 2008, the quarter when Lehman Brothers collapsed to trigger the biggest financial crisis in generations. It\u2019s a bigger fall than expected, showing that the labour market continues to recover. The total number of people out of work fell by 146,000 in the quarter, to 2.109m. Lots more details and reaction to follow.... Boom, that\u2019s 9.30am. Bank of England minutes first -- they show that BoE policymakers were split 7-2 on whether to raise interest rates again. Martin Weale and Ian McCafferty both wanted to raise rates to 0.75%, but were outvoted. Analysts at Dutch ING predict that today\u2019s unemployment figures will show the jobless rate falling, and earnings picking up (after dropping to just +0.6% annually last month) They say: \u201cWe expect July unemployment to fall to 6.3% and are looking for a rebound in July average weekly earnings.\u201d Just 30 minutes until we get the UK labour market report. There\u2019s a few points to watch: Whether the jobless rate fell in the May-July quarter, from 6.4% a month ago. Whether the claimant count dipped in August Did average annual earnings pick up, after hitting just +0.6% a month ago, or -0.2% including bonuses? Whether more people become self-employed... ....or are in part-time jobs but would rather be full time Speaking of Scotland, our Europe editor Ian Traynor has analysed how the prospect of Scottish independence is causing head-scratching in Brussels: Here\u2019s a flavour: A new regime is just taking shape in Brussels, readying to run the European Union for the next five years. Already it is clear that the three big items sitting in the in-trays for the new commission, the new parliament and the new president of the European council include what is known in Brussels as \u201cthe British question\u201d \u2013 whether the UK stays in the EU and on what terms. The British question could be very soon superseded or joined by \u201cthe Scottish question\u201d \u2013 the riddle of Scotland\u2019s future in Europe should it opt to go it alone and quit the UK. The Scottish question has senior EU officials and diplomats breaking out in a sweat. British officials in Brussels are besieged by anxious questions as to what is going to happen. There are few clear answers to the Scotland and Europe dilemma. Only many more questions. On the whole, Brussels is praying for a no victory. The two top outgoing officials in Brussels, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, head of the European commission, and Herman Van Rompuy, president of the European council have both been less than generous when speaking of Scotland\u2019s EU prospects. A yes to independence will take the EU into completely uncharted territory, legally and politically.... Here\u2019s the full story: EU officials, already vexed by \u2018British question\u2019 must consider Scotland too And here\u2019s why traders are protecting themselves against sterling volatility today: The pound has risen a little this morning, gaining around 0.15% against the US dollar and the euro to $1.63 and \u20ac1.258. But that is partly because the dollar is generally weaker, after the WSJ predicted last night that the Federal Reserve will not hint at an earlier rate rise at today\u2019s meeting. And there are still signs of jitters over tomorrow\u2019s Scottish referendum in the City. The cost of hedging against sharp swings in the British pound over the next 24 hours has doubled this morning, according to Reuters data, as traders brace for volatility. Kit Juckes of Societe Generale says the pound could be hit hard by a Yes victory on Friday morning: The latest opinion polls still put the \u201cNo\u2019s\u201d ahead in the Scottish referendum, but the result will be extremely close. The FX market remains long the pound and that is why GBP/USD has only bounced modestly. The risk is greater to the downside on a \u2018Yes\u2019 than to the upside on a \u2018No\u2019. European stock markets are open, and the FTSE 100 has picked up 16 points, or 0.25%, in opening trading to 6806. The French and German markets both rose by 0.5%, following gains on Wall Street last night. Traders are being encouraged by reports from Beijing that the People\u2019s Bank of China is pumping $81bn of liquidity into the Chinese banking system to prevent the economy slowing further. Speculation that the Federal Reserve will maintain its pledge to leave interest rates unchanged for a considerable time is also boosting shares. After some grim years, Europe\u2019s auto industry may finally be looking towards a better future. Industry body ACEA reports that sales rose by 5.6% across Europe in July and by 2.1% in August. That means 12 months of steady gains, with dealers shifting 6% more cars so far this year than in 2013. The recovery is still somewhat lopsided, though, with French demand notably weak: In July, France was the only major market to shrink (-4.3%). Elsewhere, growth ranged from 5.5% in Italy, 6.6% in the UK, 6.8% in Germany and 11.1% in Spain, leading to a 5.6% upturn in the region. Overall, 1,041,683 new cars were registered in the month. In August, upturn prevailed across significant markets, resulting in an overall 2.1% increase in the EU. France, Germany and Italy registered a slight decrease (-2.6%, -0.4% and -0.2% respectively), while the other major markets expanded, registering 13.7% more in Spain and 9.4% in the UK. Bad news from Sony -- the Japanese electronics giant has just warned that it will incur a much larger loss than previously forecast, and has suspended its dividend. Sony is taking a 180bn yen (\u00a31.03bn) impairment charge on its mobile communications business. It blamed tougher competition in the smartphone market. Sony had already predicted that it would make a loss this year, of around 50bn yen. That\u2019s now been hiked to 230bn yen. It\u2019s the latest in a string of bad news for Sony, as Bloomberg points out: Chief Executive Officer Kazuo Hirai is struggling to revive Sony through content, consoles and mobile devices. The company has lost money in five of the last six years amid declining demand for televisions and compact cameras. And fastFT reckons Sony is on track to have lost one trillion yen, or around \u00a35bn, over the last five years. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, business and the eurozone. Is Britain\u2019s labour market continuing to recover, and is the Bank of England any closer to raising interest rates? We\u2019ll get the answer to both questions this morning, with the latest unemployment report and the minutes of the BoE\u2019s most recent monetary policy committee meeting, both at 9.30am BST sharp. Economists predict that the UK jobless rate fell again in the three months to July, from 6.4% to 6.3%. The number of people claiming unemployment benefit could also drop. But for millions of workers, the big issue is whether wages are creeping back towards inflation; the average earnings figures are likely to show that real pay is still falling. The BoE minutes, meanwhile, will show whether any more Monetary Policy Committee members voted to raise interest rates in their meeting a fortnight ago. Last month, two MPC members plumped to hike, but were outvoted by the other seven. It\u2019s unlikely that a third hawk has appeared, but you never know.... In Europe, the latest car sales figures have just been released showing that sales rose for the 12th month running. More on that shortly... And traders are nervously waiting for the Federal Reserve to end its monthly meeting tonight. All the attention is whether the US central bank tweaks its forward guidance on monetary policy, and drop the pledge to keep interest rates unchanged for a \u201cconsiderable period\u201d. Not much in the corporate calendar, but high street chain JD Sports have hiked their profit expectations after a decent start to the year.",

But the former prime minister's arguments were aimed not at the already committed on both sides, but on the relatively large numbers of \"don't knows\" still unsure about the six key economic issues. They are:</p> <h2><strong>Currency union</strong> </h2> <p>Central to the whole debate is what currency an independent Scotland would use. Westminster politicians have argued that the lesson of the crisis in the eurozone is that monetary unions without political union are a recipe for disaster. One thing George Osborne and Ed Balls agree on is that there will be no currency union after a yes vote. The polls suggest that this has not been the game clincher the no camp expected.</p> <p>Alex Salmond, Scotland's first minister, says a currency union makes sense given the large amount of trade that flows north-south across the Tweed and that politicians in London will adopt a less belligerent pose once the referendum is out of the way. Scotland, he says, is prepared to pick up its share of the UK national debt after independence but only if it gets a fair share of the assets, including the pound.</p> <h2><strong>No currency union</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong></p> <p>The second big issue, therefore, is what might happen if Westminster is not bluffing. In those circumstances, Salmond says Scotland could use the pound anyway, in the way that Panama uses the US dollar. But that means having no say in how the Bank of England sets monetary policy and \u2013 even more importantly \u2013 Threadneedle Street would not act as the lender of last resort for Scotland's banks.</p> <h2><strong>Lender of last resort</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong></p> <p>Having a central bank to stand behind the banks matters because the liabilities of the Scottish banks are 12 times as big as the annual output of the Scottish economy. To put that in perspective, in Ireland and Iceland they were eight times as big ahead of the crippling 2007-08 banking crisis.</p> <p>RBS and Lloyds banking group have already made it clear they will be taking no risks. After a yes vote, whether or not there is a deal on a currency union, they have announced that they will shift their HQs to London.</p> <p>In the long run, it might make sense for Scotland to be less dependent on the financial sector as a source of growth. In the short term, however, an exodus by banks, insurance companies and fund managers would leave a big hole in Scotland's budget and lead to concerns about its balance of payments.</p> <h2><strong>Twin deficits</strong></h2> <p>How Scotland would deal with this potential \"twin deficit\" is the fourth question. Prof Ronald MacDonald, of Glasgow University, has calculated that even with oil revenues from the North sea, Scotland would have a balance of payments deficit of between 2-5% of national output (gross domestic product) and a budget deficit of 5% of GDP. Salmond and his economic team say oil will come to the rescue.</p> <h2><strong>How much oil does Scotland really have?</strong></h2> <p>The yes campaign cites estimates from the industry body, Oil &amp; Gas UK, showing that there are 24bn barrels of crude reserves yet to be pumped, and potentially even more once fields to the west of Scotland have been exploited.</p> <p>However, the Edinburgh-based energy consultants Wood Mackenzie estimate reserves at just over 15bn barrels.</p> <h2><strong>Austerity</strong></h2> <p>One of the factors helping the yes camp during the campaign has been anger about cuts imposed on Scotland by the coalition in London that Scotland did not vote for.</p> <p>Yet austerity will not end in the event of a yes vote. Indeed, it might need to intensify because a new Scottish government would start life with a sizeable budget deficit and would need to finance its share of the national debt (around \u00a3120bn).</p> <p>The question is not austerity or no austerity, but austerity imposed by Westminster or austerity imposed by Holyrood.</p>",

Westminster politicians have argued that the lesson of the crisis in the eurozone is that monetary unions without political union are a recipe for disaster. One thing George Osborne and Ed Balls agree on is that there will be no currency union after a yes vote. The polls suggest that this has not been the game clincher the no camp expected. Alex Salmond, Scotland's first minister, says a currency union makes sense given the large amount of trade that flows north-south across the Tweed and that politicians in London will adopt a less belligerent pose once the referendum is out of the way. Scotland, he says, is prepared to pick up its share of the UK national debt after independence but only if it gets a fair share of the assets, including the pound. No currency union The second big issue, therefore, is what might happen if Westminster is not bluffing. In those circumstances, Salmond says Scotland could use the pound anyway, in the way that Panama uses the US dollar. But that means having no say in how the Bank of England sets monetary policy and \u2013 even more importantly \u2013 Threadneedle Street would not act as the lender of last resort for Scotland's banks. Lender of last resort Having a central bank to stand behind the banks matters because the liabilities of the Scottish banks are 12 times as big as the annual output of the Scottish economy. To put that in perspective, in Ireland and Iceland they were eight times as big ahead of the crippling 2007-08 banking crisis. RBS and Lloyds banking group have already made it clear they will be taking no risks. After a yes vote, whether or not there is a deal on a currency union, they have announced that they will shift their HQs to London. In the long run, it might make sense for Scotland to be less dependent on the financial sector as a source of growth. In the short term, however, an exodus by banks, insurance companies and fund managers would leave a big hole in Scotland's budget and lead to concerns about its balance of payments. Twin deficits How Scotland would deal with this potential \"twin deficit\" is the fourth question. Prof Ronald MacDonald, of Glasgow University, has calculated that even with oil revenues from the North sea, Scotland would have a balance of payments deficit of between 2-5% of national output (gross domestic product) and a budget deficit of 5% of GDP. Salmond and his economic team say oil will come to the rescue. How much oil does Scotland really have? The yes campaign cites estimates from the industry body, Oil &amp; Gas UK, showing that there are 24bn barrels of crude reserves yet to be pumped, and potentially even more once fields to the west of Scotland have been exploited. However, the Edinburgh-based energy consultants Wood Mackenzie estimate reserves at just over 15bn barrels. Austerity One of the factors helping the yes camp during the campaign has been anger about cuts imposed on Scotland by the coalition in London that Scotland did not vote for. Yet austerity will not end in the event of a yes vote. Indeed, it might need to intensify because a new Scottish government would start life with a sizeable budget deficit and would need to finance its share of the national debt (around \u00a3120bn). The question is not austerity or no austerity, but austerity imposed by Westminster or austerity imposed by Holyrood.",

We see untapped UK growth potential and JD has positioned itself well to join in the European consolidation game that we believe is likely to play out. We forecast \u00a314.7m of outdoor and fashion loss in 2015, which if eliminated would enhance earnings by 18%. Elsewhere recycled packaging group DS Smith has risen 14.7p to 287.7p after an upbeat trading statement and positive outlook for the rest of the year. But IG has dropped 28.5p to 575p after the online trading group said first quarter revenue had fallen 9%, hit by lower client numbers amid quiet market trading conditions. Liberum said: First quarter revenues of \u00a385.6m, missed our estimates by 7%...Revenue across the geographies were weak: UK revenue fell by 3%, Australia by 10% and in Europe by 9%. To meet full year consensus net revenue of \u00a3395m, IG would need to deliver \u00a3103m of revenue per quarter for the rest of 2015, which looks unlikely. Hence we are expecting full year consensus downgrade of up to 5%. More positively, increased market volatility in September (Scottish referendum, Ukraine, ECB QE) should be relatively supportive for second quarter 2015 revenues. * Ashley reportedly said in 2011: \"I'll finish off JJB first, then I'll move on to JD.\"",

The nine-strong monetary policy committee (MPC), which meets every month to set the central bank's base rates, voted at their September gathering to maintain the lowest rates in British history at 0.5%, according to minutes of the gathering. Martin Weale and Ian McCafferty, both external members of the committee, pushed for a hike to 0.75% in response to lower unemployment and a tightening labour market. But the remaining seven, including the Bank of England governor Mark Carney, agreed that the failure of wages to rise above the rate of inflation meant there was little domestic pressure on prices over the next couple of years.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The City is ruling out a rise in interest rates this year amid evidence that a fresh fall in unemployment to its lowest levels since the height of the financial crisis has failed to reignite pay growth. Data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed that joblessness on the internationally agreed yardstick was 468,000 lower in the three months to July than in the same quarter of 2013 \u2013 the biggest annual decline since the Lawson boom was raging in 1988. George Osborne said the 146,000 fall in joblessness marked \"another step on the road to full employment\" but Labour and the Trades Union Congress (TUC) seized on news that earnings were failing to keep pace with prices. Shadow employment minister Stephen Timms said: \"Pay excluding bonuses today is the lowest on record. Under this government wages after inflation have already fallen by more than \u00a31,600 a year since 2010 and by next year working people will have seen the biggest fall in wages of any parliament since 1874.\" Frances O'Grady, TUC general secretary, said: \"Last week the governor of the Bank of England said the fall in real wages is the worst since the 1920s and today's figures show it getting worse. Pay increases are less than half the rate of inflation, so living standards keep on falling.\" ONS figures showed unemployment on the \"labour force survey\" measure fell to 2.02m in the three months ending in July. The rate fell more sharply than expected, with the drop from 6.4% to 6.2% taking it to levels not seen for almost six years. The alternative \"claimant count\" measure, which looks at the number of people out of work and claiming jobseeker's allowance, fell by 37,200 to 966,500 in August, the first time it has been below a million since September 2008, when the global financial crisis began with the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers. Between May and June this year there were 774,000 more people in work than in the same three months of 2013, but the ONS said that in the three months ending in July, employment rose by just 74,000, the smallest increase for more than a year. It said that of the 74,000 jobs created, 68,000 were part-time. ONS data for pay showed that increases in earnings continue to lag behind the 1.5% annual inflation rate, although the gap is narrowing. Pay including bonuses in the three months ending in July was 0.6% higher than in the same three months of 2013, while excluding bonuses it was up by 0.7%. In the three months to June, earnings including bonuses were 0.2% lower than a year earlier, while excluding bonuses they were up by 0.6%. Annual comparisons in recent months have been distorted by the timing of City bonuses in 2013, which were deferred to take advantage of the fall in the top rate of income tax from 50% to 45%. John Philpott, director of the Jobs Economist consultancy, said: \"Although the UK labour market continues to improve, there are tentative signs in the latest figures that the balance between job creation and pay growth may have started to shift. The increase of 74,000 in the number of people in work is less than half that recorded in the previous quarter and the lowest quarterly increase for a year. \"Moreover, in contrast with recent quarters almost all the net new jobs were part-time. Pay meanwhile ticked up a bit with growth in regular pay (excluding bonuses) rising from 0.6% to 0.7% and the gap between regular pay growth and CPI inflation \u2013 the real pay squeeze \u2013 narrowing from -1.3% to 0.9%.\" David Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce, said: \"Annual wage increases remain well below 1% which is much lower than the rate of inflation. This reinforces our belief that the [Bank of England's] Monetary Policy Committee must delay raising interest rates until well into 2015. We must give businesses a period of stability with low interest rates, if we are to strengthen the economic recovery.\" Anna Stupnytska, global economist at Fidelity Worldwide Investment said it would take time for earnings to start rising faster than prices. \"This, combined with the current housing weakness and a number of uncertainties (including the status of Scotland post-referendum and the course of the Russia/Ukraine conflict), should keep the Bank of England in the accommodative mode to \u2013 at least \u2013 year end.\"",

It came just eight months after the two had issued a surprise joint statement calling for the OECD to accelerate its work on tax reform. In the statement, both finance ministers condemned out of date rules that allowed \"some multinational businesses to shift the taxation of their profits away from the jurisdictions where they are being generated\". Now Osborne is accused of inviting such behaviour. Concerns about the controversial incentives have already been taken to the European Union's code of conduct committee, and they have been criticised in Britain by the Institute for Fiscal Studies. Osborne has insisted patents are a legitimate focus for tax breaks because of \"a particularly strong link to ongoing high-tech research and development\". But the IFS noted that \"the policy does not require that the innovative activity underlying a patent takes place in the UK\". The patent box scheme \u2013 first proposed under the previous Labour government \u2013has also been criticised for handing big savings to large groups which account for the majority of patents, such as the pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline.",

      "bodyText": "All companies \u2013 not just banks \u2013 will have to be able to claw back directors' pay and prove bonuses are linked to performance under a new City code published on Wednesday. The biennial review of the corporate governance code will also require companies to provide more information for shareholders on the risks they run and how long they will be able to continue in business under their current financing arrangements. The Financial Reporting Council (FRC) code comes after a lengthy and fraught consultation involving shareholders, companies and their auditors, and sparked the concerns of the Institute of Directors. Some 1,300 companies are subject to it, on a \"comply or explain\" basis \u2013 allowing deviations if shareholders are provided with an explanation. The changes to pay are broadly in line with changes to the law already under way. The FRC also put the City on notice that its next review, to be completed in two years, will tackle boardroom diversity, which is currently in focus because of the target set by Lord Davies for 25% of the seats in FTSE 100 boards to be held by women by 2015. The FRC intends to include provisions on boardroom diversity when it updates its guidelines on succession planning for company bosses. \"Diversity can be just as much about difference of approach and experience. The FRC is considering this as part of a review of board succession planning and will consider the need to consult on these issues for the next update to the code in 2016,\" it said. The more immediate changes require an extension of clawback arrangements already imposed on bankers by City regulators. The code sets outs that companies should have arrangements to enable them to \"recover or withhold variable pay when appropriate to do so\". The code also requires companies to consider how long directors should wait before receiving their bonuses and also put more emphasis on ensuring pay policies are linked to performance. \"The changes to the code are designed to strengthen the focus of companies and investors on the longer term and the sustainability of value creation,\" said Stephen Haddrill, chief executive of the FRC. He added: \"The changes on remuneration also focus companies on aligning reward with the sustained creation of value rather than, as before, simply on retention \u2013 a focus that has tended to promote pay escalating and leap-frogging.\" The code also incorporates changes recommended by former Aviva boss Lord Sharman in his 2012 review into how ompanies and auditors should describe the ability of a company to keep operating as a going concern. The review was commissioned in the light of the bailout of banks in 2008. The Sharman proposals have been subjected to two years of consultation and sparked controversy, most recently in July when investors were concerned that the outcome would be weaker then intended. Under the code, companies will now make two statements \u2013 one based on accounting rules and one requiring directors to assess their ability to keep operating for more than 12 months. This may yet prove controversial with some investors who had argued there should be just one statement. \"Recognising the different circumstances of companies, they will be allowed to choose the period over which they look forward but we are clear this should explain their reasoning to investors,\" said Haddrill. Roger Barker, director of corporate governance at the IoD, said he was concerned about the need to produce these so-called viability statements. \"The future is inherently uncertain and companies do not have crystal balls. Although investors would like companies to provide them with certainty about their future prospects, this is often not realistic,\" Barker said. Robert Hodgkinson, executive director of the accountancy body ICAEW, questioned whether the new requirements on pay would help to reduce bonus levels. \"Some research suggests that companies are changing their remuneration policies. However, what impact these changes will have longer term is hard to tell. There has been a trend for remuneration to increase over the past years despite efforts to contain it,\" said Hodgkinson. \u2022 This article was amended on 17 September 2014, to correct Robert Hodgkinson's job title.",
