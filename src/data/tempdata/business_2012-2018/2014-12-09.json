      "bodyText": "Tesco\u2019s fortunes hit a fresh low yesterday after its new boss admitted the cost of cleaning up its financial dealings with suppliers and drafting in extra workers to its struggling UK branches had blown a \u00a3500m hole in annual profits. In one of the biggest profit collapses witnessed in the City in recent times the supermarket group said it would now make annual profits of \u00a31.4bn, compared with the already lowered \u00a31.9bn figure pencilled in by City analysts at the end of the summer, when it admitted it was losing an escalating supermarket price war to discount rivals Aldi and Lidl. Last year Tesco banked profits of \u00a33.3bn. On his 100th day as the group\u2019s chief executive, Dave Lewis was unapologetic about the profits slump saying he had not used the \u201cartificial\u201d tricks relied on by previous executives to paint a rosier picture. \u201cThere are a number of levers I could pull if I wanted to make a short-term profit,\u201d said Lewis. \u201cIt is a deliberate decision by me and the executive team that we don\u2019t want to do that.\u201d Lewis said Tesco would not be making a swath of shopfloor staff redundant after Christmas \u2013 as it has done in previous years \u2013 as he is keen to improve service: \u201cCertain activities help you manage profits, but can have a detrimental impact on how you serve customers,\u201d he said. Tuesday\u2019s bad news wiped another \u00a31bn off Tesco\u2019s stock market value. Tesco has lost half its value in the past year and its huge UK chain, which accounts for nearly 30% of the UK grocery market, is now thought to be loss-making. Lewis was parachuted in from consumer goods giant Unilever to lead a major overhaul of the business, which is struggling to compete as shoppers defect to cheaper rivals and turn their backs on the big out-of-town supermarkets. Lewis insisted he could see a \u201cclear way out\u201d of the mire but his confidence did little to soothe investors. Shares fell by 17% in early trading to touch a 14\u2013year low \u2013 but later recovered to close down more than 6% at 174.9p. The new profit warning increased the likelihood of the company\u2019s credit rating being cut to \u201cjunk\u201d \u2013 a blow that would make it more expensive for the company to borrow money. The scale of the collapse in profits means Britain\u2019s biggest retailer is far from out of the woods. It is the fifth time this year Tesco has signalled lower profits on the horizon. The dire trading performance of its shops was compounded by the autumn accounting scandal that exposed murky dealings with suppliers. One shareholder said the uncertainty made its shares suitable only for the \u201cvery brave\u201d. Lewis is promising to shed more light on his plans \u2013 amid rumours of a cash call on investors or a fire-sale of businesses to reduce debts \u2013 when he updates the City on Christmas trading in January. He said Tesco had now cracked down on rogue behaviour, with all 960 staff involved in supplier negotiations retrained in sessions led by Lewis. The new approach, he said, would see the retailer seek to make a profit on the products it actually sells rather than behind the scenes manoeuvring with suppliers to secure payments for placing their products in prominent spots in the store or rebates for hitting previously agreed sales targets. The changes to its supplier dealings accounted for about the third of the shortfall in profits with the remainder spread across a series of initiatives designed to staunch the rate of customer defections. The retailer has taken on 6,000 more staff since mid-October and as part of the customer charm offensive its top 400 stores will have a Christmas greeter to usher in customers and staff on hand to help them pack their shopping at the checkout. \u201cOur new commercial approach will underpin stronger long-term relationships with our suppliers whilst at the same time ensuring that revenue recognition is transparent and appropriate,\u201d Lewis said, although he later admitted it was not opting out of the previous system altogether. \u201cWe are not walking away from rebates, but what we are doing is sitting down with all our suppliers and looking at what may be a better way of structuring the relationship.\u201d Instead of pushing the button on price cuts, as many analysts had envisaged, Lewis has made smaller changes, such as making sure its 1,000 bestselling products are in stock and cutting checkout queues. Asked how long he thought it would take to turn around the business, Lewis said: \u201cI don\u2019t have a crystal ball to know how fast customers will respond.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The EU\u2019s most powerful official is under mounting pressure as dozens more multinational corporate names are dragged into the Luxembourg tax scandal following a new leak of confidential documents on Tuesday. Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European commission, has been battling to distance himself from the growing furore over the Grand Duchy\u2019s role in facilitating \u201cindustrial scale\u201d tax avoidance. Among the new companies exposed in the secret tax documents are Disney, FTSE 100 firm Reckitt Benckiser, the Skype internet-phone arm of Microsoft and Koch Industries. The Koch empire is the second largest privately-owned business in the US and is controlled by siblings who fund rightwing political campaigns. According to documents obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists dozens of multinationals implicated in the latest leaks engineered complicated corporate structures that often helped reduce tax bills to a fraction of what they otherwise would have been. Documents analysed by the Guardian show: \u2022 Skype, the voice-over-internet business now owned by Microsoft, used two Luxembourg companies and an Irish subsidiary to circulate royalties and profits in a pattern that helped its Skype Technologies unit in Luxembourg report no corporation tax over a five-year period. \u2022 Invista, an offshoot of Koch Industries that owns the Lycra brand, underwent a 26-step restructuring called \u201cProject Snow\u201d. Invista uses an internal bank that lends cash to other group companies at high rates of interest. The exotic corporate structure neatly allows the company to pick up a lucrative tax break in Switzerland and at the same time keep its Luxembourg tax bill to a minimum. The new revelations will step up the pressure on Juncker who, in his former role as prime minister of Luxembourg, pointedly praised Luxembourg\u2019s tax policies, something that attracted Skype to the Grand Duchy. In 2005, when Juncker was both prime minister and finance minister of Luxembourg, he said: \u201cSkype will remain based here \u2026 this is partly because of the favourable fiscal environment we\u2019ve created here in Luxembourg.\u201d Since revelations last month about scores of controversial Luxembourg tax deals \u2013 some of which are many years old but still in use \u2013 Juncker has sought to brush aside suggestions the Grand Duchy, under his leadership, undermined the tax receipts of other nations by enabling large-scale tax avoidance by multinationals. \u201cI am not the architect of the Luxembourg model because this model doesn\u2019t exist,\u201d he said last month, insisting that his government did no more than compete hard for inward investment as others did. Juncker has faced mounting criticism, including a censure vote in the European parliament, in the wake of the first document leak. The Guardian, together with the ICIJ and more than 20 other news organisations worldwide, revealed that about 340 companies \u2013 including Fedex, Pepsi, Shire Pharmaceuticals, Icap and Ikea \u2013 had secured tax deals with Luxembourg with the assistance of accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers. Last week, the finance ministers of Germany, France and Italy demanded a clampdown on Luxembourg-based tax avoidance in a letter to the EC\u2019s commissioner for economic affairs, Pierre Moscovici. They said: \u201cOur citizens and our companies expect us to cope with tax avoidance and aggressive planning.\u201d The latest batch of documents show that the creation of aggressive tax structures is not limited to PwC alone. The new papers include similar deals secured for big clients by the remaining members of the big four group of accounting firms \u2013 EY, Deloitte and KPMG. On Monday, the chair of the Commons public accounts committee, Margaret Hodge, said last month\u2019s revelations had raised serious questions over Juncker\u2019s suitability as the head of the EU\u2019s executive arm. \u201cSince I have uncovered all this I have questions about if Mr Juncker is fit to be the president of the European commission. I think if this had been around during the period of his appointment it might well be a different decision.\u201d Widespread use of complex tax structures is believed to cost western countries billions in lost revenues every year. The structures revealed in the Luxembourg documents shelter corporate profits, leaving a hole in tax receipts for nations around the world. After being shown the Guardian\u2019s investigations into Skype, Stephen Shay, a Harvard Law School professor who last year gave expert testimony on Apple\u2019s tax avoidance structures in a Senate investigation, said: \u201c What Skype is demonstrating is the extent to which the smaller countries are willing to engage in tax competition - and they\u2019re getting relatively little out of it. The losses to the other countries compared to the gains for the smaller countries are really disproportionate.\u201d The new whistleblower revelations follow the leak of 28,000 documents from accountancy group PwC last month. Speaking this week, Hodge described PwC\u2019s work as a \u201cmass-marketed tax avoidance scheme\u201d. PwC has denied mass-marketing tax avoidance. Skype and Koch Industries were advised by EY. The leaked documents detail confidential tax deals thrashed out by accountancy advisers with Luxembourg tax officials. They are known as \u201cadvance tax agreements\u201d or \u201ccomfort letters\u201d and give the green light for advantageous structures to be established. They are completely legal but increasingly controversial. Koch Industries said: \u201cLike all Koch companies, Invista conducts its business lawfully, and pays its taxes in accordance with applicable laws. As the Guardian has previously acknowledged, all of our activities in these matters are legal.\u201d US parented companies including Koch Industries\u2019 Invista division, Skype and others included in the new cache of papers are taxed on their worldwide income by the American tax authorities. However, US tax rules offer generous loopholes for keeping tax on foreign earnings to a minimum. Microsoft, Skype\u2019s parent, said: \u201cMicrosoft\u2019s acquisition of Skype was finalised in October 2011, so we can only speak to activities after that date.\u201d The statement added that Microsoft had since changed Skype\u2019s business model: \u201cAs a global business, Microsoft adheres carefully to the laws and regulations of every country in which we operate.\u201d Asked whether Skype\u2019s 2005 tax ruling was still active, Microsoft declined to comment. The big four accountants have substantial and growing operations in Luxembourg. According to the ICIJ, EY\u2019s office in the country brought in $153m of revenue in the most recent year with most growth coming from its tax business. It is planning to hire 350 new employees there. Just after last month\u2019s PwC revelations, the accountancy giant held a grand opening for a vast new office complex in Luxembourg attended by the country\u2019s prime minister Xavier Bettel and finance minister Pierre Gramegna. PwC had invited reporters to the event but withdrew the invitations in the wake of the first batch of document leaks. The EC has pledged to fast-track new legislation to establish greater scrutiny of sweetheart tax avoidance deals for big companies. Last week a spokeswoman for Pierre Moscovici, the European economics commissioner whose brief includes taxation, said draft legislation would be tabled within months obliging EU governments to share information on corporation tax agreements they have struck with multinationals. The latest revelations are likely to ramp up the pressure even further on Brussels to demand greater tax transparency among EU nations. The commission is already investigating tax deals awarded to several companies and is examining whether they amount to illegal state aid. In the case of Luxembourg it is probing deals handed to Amazon and a subsidiary of Fiat. Separate investigations are underway into Ireland\u2019s tax relationship with Apple and Starbucks in the Netherlands. How it works: the \u2018Swiss branch of a Luxembourg finance company\u2019 One of the schemes used by multinationals is known to tax planners as \u201cthe Swiss branch of a Luxembourg finance company\u201d. Our graphic explains how this works. Skype: case study By 2005 Skype was established as one of the great disrupters of the digital age. Its use of the internet to carry voice calls threatened to undermine the world\u2019s biggest telecoms companies, from AT&amp;T to Vodafone, and made it one of the most coveted up-starts in the tech world. Like Amazon, another tech revolutionary, it used the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg as a European corporate launch pad for its ambitions. So when it was bought by online auctioneer eBay for $2.6bn in September 2005, the country did not want to lose one of its most famous corporate guests. It was with some pride one month later that Jean-Claude Juncker, then prime minister of Luxembourg, declared: \u201cSkype will remain based here \u2026 This is partly because of the favourable fiscal environment we\u2019ve created.\u201d His comments were made in the context of remarks about Luxembourg\u2019s ultra-low rate of VAT, from which Skype also benefited greatly. But they might have applied as easily to the generous \u2013 though undisclosed \u2013 corporate income tax treatment Skype enjoyed in the Grand Duchy. The origins of Skype\u2019s Luxembourg scheme lie in the company\u2019s drive to launch paid-for services. By early 2004 Niklas Zennstrom, one of Skype\u2019s Scandinavian co-founders, was hinting at such plans. He was referring to SkypeOut, a service launched in July 2004 that allowed users to dial landlines and mobile phones anywhere in the world but pay local call rates. This was where Skype\u2019s commercial value lay: not only was it tearing down the business models of established telecoms groups, this time there was a plan to make money with a low-cost alternative service. Zennstrom and co-founder Janus Friis mainly worked from an office in London with much of the coding and software architecture created by developers in Estonia. However, the main company in the group, Skype Technologies SA, had its headquarters in Luxembourg. On the last day of 2004, nine months before the eBay transaction was announced, Skype Technologies arranged for certain intellectual property rights \u2013 including IP connected to SkypeOut \u2013 to be transferred to a new subsidiary it had created in Ireland called Skype Limited. This IP was Skype\u2019s crown jewels, the key to its commercial potential. And what did the Irish company provide in return? Published accounts for neither company are very illuminating. They do show, however, that on the day of the IP transfer the net book value of the new Irish IP-owning company was just \u20ac25,000. Later Skype\u2019s tax advisers would explain to the Luxembourg tax authorities that the transfer had valued the IP \u201cat cost\u201d \u2014 that is, it was judged to be worth no more than it had cost to develop it. In a 2005 tax agreement, leaked to the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), Skype\u2019s advisers from accounting firm Ernst &amp; Young justified the valuation in part by explaining that, although some paid-for Skype services had been launched, it was too early to gauge whether they would be successful and profitable. Moreover, Luxembourg tax authorities were told, large competitors were developing similar services. And Skype believed that, in the absence of profits, no buyer would pay more than cost-price for the brand. Leaked records show this explanation was accepted by the tax authorities, stamped \u201cread and approved\u201d on 30 June 2005 by the accommodating Marius Kohl, one of Luxembourg\u2019s top tax officials. And that is not all Kohl rubber stamped for Skype. The group\u2019s tax advisers also wanted assurances that they could expect to enjoy yearly tax breaks on royalties linked to the IP which had been switched to Ireland. Here is how the structure worked: Irish subsidiary Skype Limited licensed rights to use its IP to its parent, Luxembourg-based Skype Technologies, at no cost. Skype Technologies then licensed on those rights to a third company Skype Communications, also based in Luxembourg, in exchange for a substantial royalty payment from the resulting revenues. Skype Communications was the company from which users around the world actually bought SkypeOut call credits and other paid-for services. As these proved increasingly popular, revenues began to soar \u2013 and so did royalty payments to Skype Technologies. Royalties of \u20ac32.6m for 2006 had doubled a year later. By 2009, they were close to \u20ac170m, and two years on they had exceeded \u20ac260m. For each of these years, however, Skype Technologies recorded no tax in its accounts. A mystifying footnote simply read: \u201cIn view of the company\u2019s tax structuring no provisions were made for corporate tax.\u201d Only through the leaked 2005 tax ruling, stamped by Kohl, does more of the picture become clear. Through its tax advisers, Skype had asked Kohl to treat 95% of the incoming royalties at Skype Technologies as if they had been paid out to its IP-owning subsidiary in Ireland. These notional payments then effectively returned to Skype Technologies in the form of dividends. The remaining 5% would be treated as the profit margin made by Skype Technologies for its role as middleman in the IP licensing chain that linked Ireland, where the valuable IP lay, with Skype Communications in Luxembourg, where payments were arriving from SkypeOut customers. The result, Ernst &amp; Young tax advisers suggested, was that Skype Technologies should receive a 95% tax deduction against its royalty income in Luxembourg. And Kohl agreed. Had royalties of that size actually been paid to Skype Limited in Ireland, they would probably have been subject to tax there. But accounts for the Irish company record no royalty income and little tax paid from 2005 up to 2009. And after the 2009 accounts were published, Skype Limited was changed to Skype (Ireland), an unlimited company no longer required to file accounts. In 2011 Skype was acquired by Microsoft for $8.5bn. It is still based in Luxembourg. Koch Industries: case study Luxembourg-based Arteva Europe Sarl is a company that is easily overlooked. It has no paid employees and its registered office in the Grand Duchy is shared by about 670 other companies, according to an analysis of filings. The company has a Swiss branch office too, but there is little sign of large-scale business activity in Zurich, where the registered branch address is in the same building as a firm of advisers, Tax Partner AG, two of whom are listed as \u201cdeputy branch managers\u201d for Arteva Europe. The branch manager, Raymond Keereweer is an experienced Dutch tax professional who gives his job title on LinkedIn as \u201ctax director, Europe\u201d for Koch International Shared Services. As well as listing his role overseeing the Zurich branch of Arteva Europe, he also works at other Koch offices in Geneva. Despite modest outward appearances, accounts show Arteva Europe functions as a huge internal bank buried within the labyrinthine financial plumbing of Koch Industries, a $115bn-a-year (\u00a373bn) global conglomerate said to be America\u2019s second-largest private business empire. This sprawling global enterprise is ultimately controlled from Wichita, Kansas, by the super-rich Koch brothers, Charles and David, fervent libertarians and among the most active financial supporters of anti-Obama campaign messages at election time. The brothers are leading funders of Washington thinktank the Cato Institute, advocates of radical free market ideas, including expounding the virtues of tax havens and warning against G20-led efforts to curb aggressive tax avoidance by multinationals \u2014 a \u201cglobal tax cartel\u201d plot, they say. Among America\u2019s most politically influential billionaires \u2014 \u201cthe Kochtopus\u201d as they are known to their detractors \u2014 Charles and David are also leading backers of Americans for Prosperity, a campaign group described as \u201cAmerica\u2019s third largest party\u201d by the Washington Post on account of the resources deployed at election time. At the end of 2013 loans and other sums due to Arteva Europe from other Koch Industries companies around the world \u2013 specifically firms within Invista division, a global chemical fibres operation best known for its Lycra clothing and Stainmaster carpeting brands \u2013 were $1.67bn. Despite lending to affiliated companies, Arteva Europe frequently charges very high interest rates, as high as 9.77%, generating considerable income \u2013 much of it for the company\u2019s Swiss finance branch. In fact, in the last four years, Arteva Europe has earned interest income from fellow Invista companies of $208m. That accounted for the lion\u2019s share of profits for the company, which totalled $269m. Over the same four-year period, however, Arteva Europe reports paying only slightly more than $10m in tax. Company accounts offer no explanation for why this tax bill is so low. The answer, however, lies in Switzerland, four-and-a-half hours\u2019 drive away from the company\u2019s head office in Luxembourg. Leaked tax rulings from the Grand Duchy tax office \u2013 rulings secured for Koch Industries\u2019 by advisers at Ernst &amp; Young \u2013 show the group wanted to make sure Luxembourg did not have taxing rights over profits Arteva Europe could demonstrate had been generated from its Swiss branch, registered to the office at no 80 Talstrasse, in Zurich, Switzerland. In Switzerland, meanwhile, finance branches of overseas companies qualify for generous tax breaks. The Swiss authorities tax these lending units as if they were required to pay large, tax-deductible interest bills \u2013 even if they have no such cost. So attractive are these arrangements, that dozens of multinationals have set up intra-group lending operations through the Swiss branch of a Luxembourg subsidiary. So controversial is the structure, however, that it has been criticised by the European Union and is seen as unlikely to survive G20-led efforts to stamp out the most egregious tax avoidance schemes deployed by multinationals. Aware that its tax regime for foreign finance branches is facing international condemnation, the Swiss government has already published proposals to water down the benefits available \u2013 though it still wants to remain the go-to location for internal banks within multinationals. Levels of income and tax reported in accounts for Arteva Europe suggest the group has carefully ensured much of its most profitable lending is routed through the branch in Zurich, with very little income arising at head office in Luxembourg. That way, it picks up a huge tax break in Switzerland and minimises its tax bill in Luxembourg. Koch Industries declined to respond to specific questions put by the Guardian. In a statement it said: \u201cLike all Koch companies, Invista [of which Arteva Europe is a part] conducts its business lawfully, and pays its taxes in accordance with applicable laws. As the Guardian has previously acknowledged, all of our activities in these matters are legal.\u201d",

And Skype believed that, in the absence of profits, no buyer would pay more than cost-price for the brand.</p> <p>Leaked records show this explanation was accepted by the tax authorities, stamped \u201cread and approved\u201d on 30 June 2005 by the accommodating Marius Kohl, one of Luxembourg\u2019s top tax officials. </p> <p>And that is not all Kohl rubber stamped for Skype. The group\u2019s tax advisers also wanted assurances that they could expect to enjoy yearly tax breaks on royalties linked to the IP which had been switched to Ireland.</p> <p>Here is how the structure worked: Irish subsidiary Skype Limited licensed rights to use its IP to its parent, Luxembourg-based Skype Technologies, at no cost. Skype Technologies then licensed on those rights to a third company Skype Communications, also based in Luxembourg, in exchange for a substantial royalty payment from the resulting revenues.</p> <p>Skype Communications was the company from which users around the world actually bought SkypeOut call credits and other paid-for services. As these proved increasingly popular, revenues began to soar \u2013 and so did royalty payments to Skype Technologies. Royalties of \u20ac32.6m for 2006 had doubled a year later. By 2009, they were close to \u20ac170m, and two years on they had exceeded \u20ac260m.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> <blockquote> <p>In view of the company\u2019s tax structuring no provisions were made for corporate tax.</p> <footer> <cite>Footnote to Skype Technologies accounts</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>For each of these years, however, Skype Technologies recorded no tax in its accounts. A mystifying footnote simply read: \u201cIn view of the company\u2019s tax structuring no provisions were made for corporate tax.\u201d</p> <p>Only through the leaked 2005 tax ruling, stamped by Kohl, does more of the picture become clear. Through its tax advisers, Skype had asked Kohl to treat 95% of the incoming royalties at Skype Technologies as if they had been paid out to its IP-owning subsidiary in Ireland. These notional payments then effectively returned to Skype Technologies in the form of dividends. </p> <p>The remaining 5% would be treated as the profit margin made by Skype Technologies for its role as middleman in the IP licensing chain that linked Ireland, where the valuable IP lay, with Skype Communications in Luxembourg, where payments were arriving from SkypeOut customers.</p> <p>The result, Ernst &amp; Young tax advisers suggested, was that Skype Technologies should receive a 95% tax deduction against its royalty income in Luxembourg. And Kohl agreed. </p> <p>Had royalties of that size actually been paid to Skype Limited in Ireland, they would probably have been subject to tax there. But accounts for the Irish company record no royalty income and little tax paid from 2005 up to 2009. And after the 2009 accounts were published, Skype Limited was changed to Skype (Ireland), an unlimited company no longer required to file accounts. In 2011 Skype was acquired by Microsoft for $8.5bn. It is still based in Luxembourg. </p> <h2>Koch Industries: case study</h2> <p>Luxembourg-based Arteva Europe Sarl is a company that is easily overlooked. It has no paid employees and its registered office in the Grand Duchy is shared by about 670 other companies, according to an analysis of filings. </p> <p>The company has a Swiss branch office too, but there is little sign of large-scale business activity in Zurich, where the registered branch address is in the same building as a firm of advisers, Tax Partner AG, two of whom are listed as \u201cdeputy branch managers\u201d for Arteva Europe.</p> <p>The branch manager, Raymond Keereweer is an experienced Dutch tax professional who gives his job title on LinkedIn as \u201ctax director, Europe\u201d for Koch International Shared Services. As well as listing his role overseeing the Zurich branch of Arteva Europe, he also works at other Koch offices in Geneva.</p> <p>Despite modest outward appearances, accounts show Arteva Europe functions as a huge internal bank buried within the labyrinthine financial plumbing of Koch Industries, a $115bn-a-year (\u00a373bn) global conglomerate said to be America\u2019s second-largest private business empire.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"48431dda02bdf2568d3759bef2b9532c189bcfab\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/9/1418153432120/bd5a4990-fa39-43f8-b33d-22226e222842-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Americans for Prosperity Foundation Chairman David Koch addresses attendees of the Defending the American Dream Summit in Orlando, Fla., Friday, Aug. 30, 2013.(AP Photo/Phelan M.

That accounted for the lion\u2019s share of profits for the company, which totalled $269m. Over the same four-year period, however, Arteva Europe reports paying only slightly more than $10m in tax. Company accounts offer no explanation for why this tax bill is so low.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"09f939ae3df3d081acd91dcb7ce9bc2701076717\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/9/1418153923391/4df51092-3ec8-4826-b500-d75cc6074218-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Zurich, Switzerland: perhaps surprisingly an important location in Luxembourg tax affairs.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Zurich, Switzerland: perhaps surprisingly an important location in Luxembourg tax affairs.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Oliver Benn/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The answer, however, lies in Switzerland, four-and-a-half hours\u2019 drive away from the company\u2019s head office in Luxembourg. Leaked tax rulings from the Grand Duchy tax office \u2013 rulings secured for Koch Industries\u2019 by advisers at Ernst &amp; Young \u2013 show the group wanted to make sure Luxembourg did not have taxing rights over profits Arteva Europe could demonstrate had been generated from its Swiss branch, registered to the office at no 80 Talstrasse, in Zurich, Switzerland.</p> <p>In Switzerland, meanwhile, finance branches of overseas companies qualify for generous tax breaks. The Swiss authorities tax these lending units as if they were required to pay large, tax-deductible interest bills \u2013 even if they have no such cost. </p> <p>So attractive are these arrangements, that dozens of multinationals have set up intra-group lending operations through the Swiss branch of a Luxembourg subsidiary. </p> <p>So controversial is the structure, however, that it has been criticised by the European Union and is seen as unlikely to survive G20-led efforts to stamp out the most egregious tax avoidance schemes deployed by multinationals. </p> <p>Aware that its tax regime for foreign finance branches is facing international condemnation, the Swiss government has already published proposals to water down the benefits available \u2013 though it still wants to remain the go-to location for internal banks within multinationals. </p> <p>Levels of income and tax reported in accounts for Arteva Europe suggest the group has carefully ensured much of its most profitable lending is routed through the branch in Zurich, with very little income arising at head office in Luxembourg. </p> <p>That way, it picks up a huge tax break in Switzerland and minimises its tax bill in Luxembourg.</p> <p>Koch Industries declined to respond to specific questions put by the Guardian. In a statement it said: \u201cLike all Koch companies, Invista [of which Arteva Europe is a part] conducts its business lawfully, and pays its taxes in accordance with applicable laws. As the Guardian has previously acknowledged, all of our activities in these matters are legal.\u201d</p>",

A full-year trading profit of \u201cno more than \u00a31.4bn\u201d implies a miss of between \u00a3400m and \u00a3800m, depending on which City analyst\u2019s inaccurate forecast you preferred. About two-thirds of the shortfall relates to killing the New Year fancy footwork and surrendering some of the up-front supplier discounts. The reason the share price recovered from its 15% fall to close the day 7% lower is that some of the hits are clearly one-off in nature. Once relationships are \u201creset\u201d they ought to stay that way, if all goes to plan and the disaffected suppliers don\u2019t seek revenge. Lewis has shovelled a lot of bad news into his first set of full-year results, but that\u2019s the prerogative of incoming chief executives. Yet Tesco shareholders would be unwise to conclude that the worst is over. Lewis\u2019s plan to create \u201csustainable value\u201d over the long-term sounds medium-term painful. The group is cutting prices and adding costs in the form of 6,000 extra staff. What will profit margins be during the early years? It\u2019s anybody\u2019s guess. How long will be the turnaround take? Lewis declines to say. In search of an answer, Tesco investors might look at Unilever, Lewis\u2019s alma mater. The consumer goods giant\u2019s version of pursuing \u201csustainable value\u201d succeeded in spades in the end \u2013 the shares have been a terrific investment if you bought after 2010.

Analysts at Espirito Santo think Tesco\u2019s UK business could even make losses consistently. Then there are the complicating factors of a fragile balance sheet and a (probably) overvalued property portfolio. The threat of a rights issue is not off the table. Lewis deserves applause for grasping that the trouble at Tesco stems from too much short-term thinking in the boardroom. An injection of long-termism is the right response. The hard reality, though, is that the work should have started many years ago under previous management, and before Aldi and Lidl changed shopping habits.

      "bodyText": "And - appropriately given its effect on global markets - back to Greece where Stavros Dimas, the government\u2019s candidate for president has made statements following prime minister Antonis Samaras\u2019s nomination of the veteran politician for the ceremonial post. Helena Smith reports from Athens: In a carefully calibrated statement, made hours after his candidacy was announced, Stavros Dimas thanked the government for the nomination \u201cand all those who, irrespective of whether they will vote for me, have said kind words about me.\u201d Appealing for unity amongst a populace that has become increasingly polarized with Greece\u2019s worst economic crisis in modern times, the 73-year-old former EU commissioner said the country and its people were facing critical times. \u201cThis national unity \u2026 is the only safe route to exit the crisis and enter a new era of progress and dignity,\u201d he told reporters as he emerged from his parliamentary office in Athens. \u201cThe honour I feel is multiplied by the positive comments that have been made by the opposition about me. I thank them and praise them for their stance \u2026. I want to assure MPs and all Greeks, in the most categorical way, that my sole concern will be, as it has always been, the interests of our homeland and our people. I call upon all to surpass whatever may divide us with courage and a feeling of responsibility.\u201d Ultimately, much may depend on Greece\u2019s two smaller parties - the Independent Greeks, which has 12 MPs and Democratic Left which has 10 MPs \u2013 to ensure that the opposition does not come up with the 121 seats to block the vote. Already, speculation is rife that the governing coalition will attempt to win over MPs by offering them potentially lucrative posts in a government that is expected to emerge after the ballot. And on that note it\u2019s time to wrap up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Markets were already concerned about a slowdown in the global economy, with disappointing trade figures on Monday and a steeper than expected recession in Japan. So the idea of further turmoil in the eurozone as Greece brought forward its presidential elections sent investors scrambling for the exit. The continuing weakness in the oil price did not help matters, while the UK market was hit by the shock profit warning from Tesco. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 142.68 points or 2.14% at 6529.47 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 2.02% to 9812.31 France\u2019s Cac closed 2.38% lower at 4271.44 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 2.81% to 19,390 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 3.12% lower at 10,468.2 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 169 points or 0.95%. With Greek bonds under pressure, in contrast German and UK government debt is benefiting. The UK 30 year gilt yields have hit a record low of 2.638% while German 10 year government bond yields are also at new lows at just 0.688%. The Athens stock market has now closed, and has recorded its biggest one day fall since 1987. Following Monday\u2019s surprise decision to bring forward a presidential vote to next week - which could trigger early elections if prime minister Antonis Samaras fails to get his candidate chosen - the market has plunged more nearly 13% to 902.84.. The political gamble could allow far-left party Syriza - which opposes the austerity measures brought in as part of the country\u2019s bailout agreement - to gain power. Meanwhile Greek 10 year bond yields jumped above 7% to stand at 7.729%. As we said previously, 7% is the classic \u2018danger zone\u2019 where a country\u2019s borrowing costs aren\u2019t affordable. Here\u2019s Reuter\u2019s take on the NIESR forecasts: British economic growth held steady at a quarterly rate of 0.7% in the three months to November, on track for a robust end to the year, an estimate from the National Institute of Economic and Social Research showed on Tuesday. NIESR\u2019s estimate follows official data showing an unexpected drop in factory output for October, which economists largely played down, saying it did not suggest the economy as a whole was slowing. \u201cGrowth for 2014 as a whole remains robust and consistent with our most recent quarterly forecast,\u201d NIESR said. The academic think tank forecast last month that Britain\u2019s economy would grow 3% this year and 2.5% in 2015. \u201cThere do remain risks around this forecast, both on the upside, in the form of reduced global oil prices, and on the downside, most notably weakness in demand from the euro area,\u201d NIESR said on Tuesday. Here\u2019s the latest UK GDP estimates from the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, and they are unchanged: Wall Street has opened, and the US market has followed the rest of the world lower. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 154 points or 0.87% and the S&amp;P 500 has lost 16.9 points or 0.82%. as the recent plunge in the oil price and the new political turmoil in Greece sent investors fleeing. Back to Tesco\u2019s profit warning... and this chart shows how earnings will probably tumble 60% year-on-year. Jon Copestake of the Economist Intelligence Unit reckons the situation is unlikely to improve soon: Tesco is seeing its margins increasingly corroded by a damaging price war with discounters who are ramping up their UK presence, squeezing mid-market retailers further. Additionally the online spending on Black Friday, Cyber-Monday and yesterday\u2019s Manic Monday in the UK indicate that a rising number of UK shoppers are moving online during the crucial Christmas shopping period. If Tesco is reporting diminished profit following the chaotic store scenes of a few weeks ago then it would seem that, despite the crowds and web traffic, November sales did not pan out as the retailer might have hoped. Charles Robertson, chief economist at Renaissance Capital, reckons the markets will be glued to events in Athens for the coming weeks. He told the FT that: \u201cGreece in the next 6 weeks may prove to be more important for global markets than Russia/Ukraine was in 2014,\u201d \u201cA possible Syriza election victory may force the Eurozone to choose between a fiscal union (debt write off for Greece) or the first Euro exit.\u201d The Greek market continues to be routed, down a staggering 11%. Nick Fletcher\u2019s market report has more details of the selloff, which has also pushed the gold price higher. Randgold Resources and Fresnillo buck FTSE fall as gold moves higher The selloff in Europe\u2019s stock market is deepening, driven by Greek election fears, Tesco\u2019s profits warning, and concerns over China. In London the FTSE 100 is now down 105 points at 6568, a drop of 1.5%. It\u2019s being led by Tesco (-10%), rival Morrison\u2019s (-4.9%), and Coca Cola Hellenic [Greece\u2019s largest company] (-5.7%). Other European indices are also down, as investors wonder whether Greece is heading for an early general election: Wall Street is expected to fall at the open too, in around 90 minutes time. Traders are looking nervously at China, where the stock market suffered its biggest fall in five years today: Daniel Sugarman, market strategist at ETX Capital, explains how the Chinese market turned tail today: What a difference a day can make; Monday\u2019s session saw the Shanghai Composite reach the 3,000 mark for the first time since 2011. By contrast, Tuesday saw the index plunge, falling 8% from its intraday high and closing down by 5.43% this morning. Q: Why is the Greek stock market in such a rout today? A: Because the radical left-wing Syriza party holds a substantial lead in the opinion polls. And if the Athens parliament rejects Stavros Dimas as their next president, early general elections are inevitable. Syriza supports Greece\u2019s membership of the eurozone, but argues that its national debt must be cut to a \u2018sustainable\u2019 level. It also opposes the austerity measures, such as cuts to wages and pensions, implemented under Greece\u2019s austerity programme. Over the weekend, the FT reported that City investors were spooked by Syriza officials on a tour of London two weeks ago. Here\u2019s a flavour: A salesman at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, which hosted a client event with George Stathakis, Greece\u2019s shadow minister for development and Syriza\u2019s economic affairs spokesman, sent a memo to clients after the meeting entitled \u201cGreek Tragedy\u201d. The memo summarised the party\u2019s economic programme, which includes ending privatisation, renegotiating Greece\u2019s debt with the troika of the European Central Bank, International Monetary Fund and European Commission, and increasing the minimum wage and state pension to pre-crisis levels. \u201cThe notes are quite clear and worrisome for Greece and the [eurozone] going forward. Expect much higher volatility in the months ahead,\u201d the memo read. Eleni Papoula, an analyst at Berenberg, added: \u201cThe economic policies of the opposition party did not seem credible.\u201d Greek officials reckon that there\u2019s a 50:50 chance that the government\u2019s candidate, Stavros Dimas, will be elected as the country\u2019s new president next week, avoiding snap general elections: From Athens, Helena Smith reports: Governments officials saying Stavros Dimas is the \u201cperfect choice\u201d to replace the nation\u2019s outgoing president as he is a moderate with wide-ranging appeal across the political spectrum. Although wholeheartedly identified with the centre-right New Democracy party as its vice-president, the 73-year-old Dimas was a highly praised EU Commissioner for the Environment and away from the hurly-burly of quotidian politics in Athens was seen to have done a good job of representing Greece abroad. His nomination is a calculated risk that he will be backed by independents (currently 24 in the 300-seat parliament) as well as opposition MPs with the Independent Greeks party, the small Democratic Left party and perhaps even the hardline KKE communist party. These are early days, but in private officials are saying that they believe the government\u2019s high-stakes gamble has a 50-50 chance of paying off. The main opposition Syriza party say any support for Dimas, as the government\u2019s nominee, will be tantamount to endorsing the loathed \u201cmemorandum of understanding\u201d signed between Greece and the troika of creditors propping up its debt-stricken economy. Syriza\u2019s leader Alexis Tsipras, who was as startled as anyone when the election was announced. The Athens stock market continues to sink, though, after Dimas was named as the government\u2019s candidate earlier today. Banks are leading the rout: Helena adds that she was at an event Tsipras was attending last night, and saw him immediately flee the amphitheatre when handed a piece of paper with the news that the presidential election had been brought forward to next week. Tsipras has just told a conference in Athens that the government was forced to make the move because of \u201cthe catastrophic impasse\u201d in which it finds itself as a result of austerity. Breaking: Credit rating agency Fitch has just taken the first step towards downgrading Japan. It has put Japan\u2019s A+ rating (th 5th highest) on rating watch negative, citing Japan\u2019s \u201chigh and rising\u201d government debt ratio, and the absence of a plan to address it. Greece\u2019s stock market is on track for its worst day in over four years: Back to the eurozone...and the Greek government has just named its candidate for next week\u2019s snap presidential election.  It\u2019s Stavros Dimas; readers may remember he was European Commissioner for the Environment from 2004 to 2009. Parliament will vote on whether to approve Dimas on 17 December. If a two-thirds majority isn\u2019t achieved (and the government controls just over 50% of MPs), then there\u2019s a second vote on December 22, and then a third on the 29th (where a three-fifths majority will do). If Dimas is rejected three times, early general elections are likely. Mujtaba Rahman of Eurasia Group explains: The government is still shy 25 seats, and while 17 MP\u2019s are leaning towards supporting the coalition we still think early elections and a Syriza government are probable next year. That\u2019s why the Greek stock market has tumbled 9% today. The problems at Tesco are even more deep-seated than we realised. The more Dave Lewis talked about rebasing its relationship with suppliers, focusing more on staple products that customers buy every week, or avoiding short-term measures that boost profits for a quarter but hurt the business, the more I wondered how the situation had possibly got so bad. The Tesco CEO marked his 100th day in charge with a three-pronged pitch during today\u2019s conference call (highlights start here). His message to consumers is that Tesco will offer a decent service all year round, with \u2018selective\u2019 price cuts on the stuff we buy the most and 6,000 extra staff among the aisles. Lewis is trying to clean up the murky business of supplier relations, to make more money when a customer buys a product, and less money for simply putting it on the shelf. And as Tesco\u2019s share price staggers back from hitting a 14-year low, Lewis is urging investors to show patience and trust. Not always the City\u2019s core virtues. Bottom line. Tesco needs an acceptable Christmas, and then Lewis needs to give some proper detail about his plans at its trading statement on 8th January. Incidentally, it\u2019s also never a great sign when the Financial Times\u2019s retail expert accuses you of talking \u2018double Dutch\u2019, as happened when Lewis tried to explain how relations with suppliers will change. And here\u2019s Reuters news snaps: TESCO CEO SAYS \u201cQUIETLY OPTIMISTIC\u201d ABOUT WHAT FIRM IS DOING TESCO CEO SAYS HAVE STARTED TO \u201cRE-BASE RELATIONSHIP WE HAVE WITH SUPPLIERS\u201d TESCO CEO SAYS \u201cNOT WALKING AWAY FROM REBATES WITH SUPPLIERS\u201d TESCO SAYS SEEING \u201cENCOURAGING SIGNS\u201d FROM SELECTIVE PRICE CUTS TESCO CEO SAYS REVIEW OF GROUP PORTFOLIO CONTINUING, NO UPDATE TODAY TESCO CEO SAYS \u201cINCREDIBLY DIFFICULT\u201d TO PREDICT TIMEFRAME OF TURNAROUND TESCO CEO SAYS UK HEAD LIKELY TO BE RECRUITED WITHIN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS TESCO CEO SAYS HAS RECEIVED \u201cVERY POSITIVE\u201d REACTION FROM SUPPLIERS The press call ends, with Dave Lewis insisting that he can turn Tesco around. Here\u2019s the gist of it: This is a fantastic business, it has a fantastic group of people working across it. We have got into a difficult position , particularly financially, but I can see a way out. It means taking difficult decisions now, and it will have an impact on the value of the companuy and the share price. This is a management team that is doing the right team for the business, recruiting 6,000 people. Our future depends on our relationship with our customers, and our long-term relations with our suppliers. There are signs of encouraging feedback......I am deeply minded of the impact I am having on shareholders as I reform this business, but I hope they understand that this is the best way to create medium and long-term shareholder value. And with that, he\u2019s off. Snap summary to follow..... Why did you promote Robin Terrell to become head of customer relations at Tesco? Because he has a track record of running companies which put customers right at the heart of their business, Lewis replies. Terrell\u2019s job now is to link up Tesco\u2019s various offerings, like Clubcard and Tesco Bank. (Terrell has previously run John Lewis Direct, and House of Fraser\u2019s \u201cmulti-channel\u201d division) Did Tesco lose its way by becoming so reliant on rebates from its own suppliers? Relations with suppliers did become \u2018bent a little\u2019, Lewis replies. We\u2019re now looking to build a new relationship with them - both big suppliers and small ones. The early response has been very positive, he says. [some background: Tesco had been receiving large sums from suppliers in return for giving their products a prominent spot on the shelves, or for hitting sales targets.] Lewis has also suggested that there could be job cuts at head office and back office, even as Tesco bulks up its stores operations. Are you worried about the slide in Tesco\u2019s share price? I\u2019ve got to be worried about the share price. I really do understand the City\u2019s concerns, says Lewis. The Times\u2019 Andy Clarke sums up Lewis\u2019s message: Lewis declines to say what profit margin he\u2019d like to see at Tesco. The \u2018critical thing\u2019 is to reset the company, and to look at everything we do to se if we can do it better and more efficiently. It won\u2019t be a smooth journey, but we\u2019re up for it. Dave Lewis confirms that some seasonal staff, such as students, will only work for Tesco over Christmas and then depart. But the 6,000 people hired since late October are needed to deliver his long-term plan. How long will this turnaround take? Everyone asks me that, Lewis replies. But I don\u2019t have a crystal ball, so I don\u2019t know how long customers will take to react to the progress we\u2019re making. You\u2019ll have to bear with us. It\u2019s \u201cincredibly difficult\u201d to predict the timeline of a turnaround. How long are you planning to run the UK business yourself? I\u2019m running Tesco UK on a temporary basis, Lewis replies, and indicates that he\u2019ll look to get a permanent leader in the next few months. My colleague Zoe Wood asks if Tesco can get back to its glory days, or is this the new reality? Lewis: What we are doing is definitely better for customers. That\u2019s a foundation to build a new company that is good for shareholders. But yes, the environment has changed, so we are \u2018resetting\u2019 the company, and we\u2019ll give you more information on January 8th. Lewis also won\u2019t comment on rumours of asset sales. Tesco has concluded its own investigation into how its profits were over-stated, and is now co-operating with the Serious Fraud Office. Why should anyone invest in Tesco? Lewis: We have nearly 30% of the grocery market. There\u2019s a lot that we can do to drive innovation. If we get Tesco firing, we can generate medium and long-term value for shareholders. The decisions we are taking will have a short-term impact on shareholders, and I regret that, Lewis adds. Shares are currently down 10% today. How is morale in head office, asks Simon Neville of the Evening Standard and the Independent. Pretty good, Lewis replies. Really? Despite many senior executives being suspended over its profit over-statements earlier this year? We\u2019ve had to take some tough decisions involving people who are \u201cnear and dear\u201d to Tesco, Lewis concedes, but there is an understanding that we are doing the right thing for the business. We\u2019ve hired 6,000 extra staff since late October. And we have also put 6,000 existing head office staff into stores for 10% of their time, to reconnect them to the company. It\u2019s been \u201chugely valuable\u201d. What are you really doing different with your suppliers, in plain English? We are taking any incentives that exist between us and the supplier, and moving it to between us and the customer, Lewis replies. That still doesn\u2019t make much sense, Andrea Felsted of the FT responds.... Morale among colleagues in store is really very high, Lewis insists. And what do you mean about not artificially boosting performance in the final quarter of the financial year? There are ways of running the machine slightly leaner in the final quarter, but that would have a detrimental impact on customer service, Dave Lewis replies. For example, you could cut your staff levels after the Christmas rush. But we\u2019re not going to do that. More details about the investment in availability please, Dave. Lewis: If you walk around a Tesco store, you\u2019ll see that we have invested in availability and price in \u201cThe thousand lines that people most value\u201d. The staple good that people buy, basically. And we\u2019ve seen volume growth on the back of that. Tesco has made five key changes since Lewis took over, he says. 1) Changing the way it deals with suppliers 2) invested in service - with an extra 6,000 3) invested in availability - \u201ci can see that in the customer feedback\u201d 4) We\u2019ve invested \u2018selectively\u2019 in price. 5) Offering a consistent performance over the year, rather than \u2018artificially\u2019 boosting performance in the last quarter of the year. And the cost of that is \u201ca little bit north of \u00a3500m\u201d. Onto questions.. What changes have been made to Tesco\u2019s relationship with suppliers. Has it abandoned its policy of seeking rebates from suppliers in return for selling their stock? Dave Lewis explains that \u201cWe have started to rebase our relationship with suppliers\u201d.... to create long-term sustainable value together. We have reset our guidelines for supplier relations, and retrained 900 people, he says. We are looking to make more \u201cfront-margin not back margin\u201d; IE, making profits on what Tesco sells, rather than what it buys. It\u2019s a more efficient model for everyone. But we\u2019re not walked away from rebates altogether, he adds. There are reasons to be \u201cquietly optimistic\u201d about what we\u2019re doing, says Lewis. And we have taken a very deliberate decision not to take short-term measures that would close the profitability gap in the short term, but would not improve relations with customers and suppliers. And we\u2019re off. Dave Lewis says he wants to give some context to today\u2019s profit warning. We weren\u2019t in a position to give full profit guidance back in October, when we began to outline our plans. But now we have much more visibility about the impact that our plans will have on short-term profitability, he says. Tesco is about to hold a conference call with journalists to explain today\u2019s profit warning. I\u2019m dialled in - there\u2019s some very soothing classical music (Vivaldi I think) Europe\u2019s stock markets are all in the red this morning. The FTSE 100 now down 80 points or 1.2%, dragged down by retailers and oil firms. Breaking away from Tesco, the Greek stock market has tumbled by over 6% in early trading. Investors are spooked by the news of a presidential election next week; and the possibility that it could trigger an early general election. Greek bonds are also falling, pushing up the yield (or interest rate) on its 10-year debt to 7.7%, from 7.4% last night. 7% is the classic \u2018danger zone\u2019 where a country\u2019s borrowing costs aren\u2019t affordable. Here\u2019s the Telegraph\u2019s Graham Ruddick\u2019s take: Tesco says it has made changes under Dave Lewis, including taking on another 6,000 store staff, and \u2018invested in price\u2019. The early feedback from customers is encouraging, it says. But Mike Dennis, analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald, predicts that reviving Tesco\u2019s fortunes will take years: We believe the CEO needs to simplify the business via UK and International asset sales, then reconnect with suppliers by changing payment terms and lowering his cost of goods and then start on the long road to rebuilding the Tesco brand with shoppers. And it may not get much help from its suppliers.... All this could take several years and suppliers are not going to be disposed to Tesco given the negative industry volumes and poor performance of Tesco over the last two years. How the mighty have fallen.... Tesco could be forced to tap its shareholders for cash in a rights issue, suggests Marc Kimsey, senior trader at Accendo Markets in London: A fire sale of assets is almost nailed on and a rights issue cannot be ruled out. Traders are clearing the decks of what remaining stock they had, and that of sector peers. Supermarkets and energy companies are dominating the list of biggest fallers on the FTSE 100, as Tesco\u2019s profit warning and the sliding oil price hit shares. Morrison\u2019s and Sainsbury\u2019s shares have both been hit, down around 5%. Analyst Nick Bubb reckons they\u2019re vulnerable to a Tesco price war: If Sainsbury, Asda and Morrisons thought that Tesco would delay any aggressive price-cutting until after Xmas, Dave Lewis has upset the apple-cart today... Around \u00a32bn has been wiped off Tesco\u2019s value this morning, reducing its market capitalisation to around \u00a313bn. Today\u2019s profit warning is \u201cbrief and patchy on detail\u201d, and gives Tesco\u2019s critics plenty more ammunition, says Richard Hunter, head of equities at Hargreaves Lansdown Stockbrokers. If there had been hope that the market would be immune to yet another profit warning, this quickly evaporated as Tesco has provided profit guidance which is nearly 30% shy of an already lowered estimate. The company partially attributed the lower figure to increased investment in the business, but amidst the accounting mishap, the revolving door in the boardroom and an unforgiving attack from the discount retailers, investors have simply lost interest in waiting for a recovery story which still seems some way off. Retail analyst Nick Bubb says Tesco has shocked the sector with a \u2018huge\u2019 profit warning: Just when the market thought Tesco were prepared to tough it out for Xmas they go and announce a huge profit warning, flagging that full-year trading profits will not exceed \u00a31.4bn, some 20-30% below recent expectations, because of unspecified actions to improve UK competitiveness... Tesco\u2019s share price just touched a new 14-year low of 155.4p, a level not seen since early 2000, as this chart shows: Tesco is being absolutely battered, says Bloomberg\u2019s Jonathan Ferro. He\u2019s not wrong Crumbs! Tesco shares have plunged by over 14% at the start of trading in London, to 161p, as this morning\u2019s profit warning triggers a wave of selling. Shares in rival supermarket Sainsbury\u2019s have tumbled 4% at the start of trading in London, as Tesco\u2019s profit warning ripples through the sector. Tesco hasn\u2019t actually traded yet, suggesting shares are going to slide.... Tesco\u2019s latest profit warning comes hot on the heels of an eventful Black Friday, which exposed some of its failings. Police were called to 15 stores to restore order, after crowds scuffled over bargains. And its website was offline for hours, unable to cope with the surge in demand. Dave Lewis can\u2019t have been impressed.... I reckon this is the fifth time this year that Tesco has warned the City that profits will be below expectations. The first profit warning came in January after a weak Christmas; a second in July which cost CEO Phil Clarke his job; a third in August when Tesco also slashed its dividend; then the shock news in September that profits had been misreported by around \u00a3250m. Tesco is actually admitting that this year\u2019s profits could be a billion pounds lower than its own estimate back in August, as FT deputy news editor Tony Tassell flags up: What a way for CEO Dave Lewis to mark his 100th day in charge at Tesco! Today\u2019s profit warning includes a pledge from Lewis to restore Tesco\u2019s competitiveness in the UK, protect and strengthen the balance sheet and rebuild trust and transparency. Whilst the steps we are taking to achieve this are impacting short-term profitability, they are essential to restoring the health of our business. We will not engage in short term actions that compromise in any way our offer for customers. Lewis was lured from Unilever to turn around Britain\u2019s biggest retailer this summer after a series of profit warnings and falling sales figures. He then had the shock of his corporate life when he discovered staff had been overstating profits by pulling forward revenue from suppliers, and delaying payments, to flatter its profits. Tesco shares are set to tumble when the stock market opens in half an hour - perhaps by as much as 10%. Tesco, Britain\u2019s supermarket giant, has hit the City with another profit warning. And it\u2019s a whopper. In an unscheduled trading update, Tesco announced that group trading profit for the current financial year will be no higher than \u00a31.4bn. City analysts had been expecting the company to make a trading profit between \u00a31.8bn and \u00a32.2bn. A year ago, it made \u00a33.3bn. Chief executive Dave Lewis, who was parachuted into Tesco in September, told shareholders this morning that he\u2019s been making changes at the company. This includes retraining staff on how to deal with suppliers, following the revelations that Tesco had overstated its profits in the first half of this year. Tesco insists that progress is being made: We have invested further in service, with more than 6,000 new colleagues in store, increased product availability on key lines and invested in price - all aimed at enhancing our customer offer. The early feedback from customers is encouraging. But the cost of turning the company around is even larger than expected: On the 8th January we will share more detail about the measures we plan to take to improve the competitiveness of the UK customer offer and to strengthen the balance sheet. On the basis of the changes and investments made to date we now anticipate group trading profit for the financial year ending February 2015 will not exceed \u00a31.4bn. That\u2019s a massive miss, frankly. Reaction to follow..... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, the eurozone and business. Coming up today.... We\u2019ll be tracking events in Greece after the government brought forward the vote to choose its next president, and also secured a two-month extension to its bailout. That presidential battle could potentially trigger early elections, with the opposition Syriza party in poll position to win: Full story: Antonis Samaras brings forward date of presidential poll in Greece There\u2019s lots afoot in the markets.... The oil price is under renewed pressure this morning, touching new five-year lows. China\u2019s currency, the yuan, is sliding too -- on track for its biggest fall in several years. And this is helping to drive shares down on the Shanghai stock market too And in Europe, new trade data from Germany and France this morning which give an insight into the state of Europe\u2019s economy. I\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day....",

She left school at 16 with five GCSEs, got a job making tea in an insurance office, then got a job selling insurance for Admiral, where she helped to set up confused.com.

Amazing. You\u2019d think someone would have got there first. But no one had.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Online fashion retailer Asos has reported slowing sales as the strength of sterling continues to weigh on its international business. The web retailer, aimed at fashion-conscious twentysomethings, reported an 8% rise in sales for the three months ending 30 November. Although viewed by analysts as \u201ca promising start\u201d to its 2015 financial year, the figures were sharply down on the two previous years when sales growth averaged more than 30%. The headline figure masked a 2% decline in sales outside the UK. Asos takes orders from almost every country and accepts payment in 15 currencies. International orders account for 57% of all sales, but they have been hit by the strength of the pound, which makes its goods more expensive abroad. \u201cThat has been the big story and we have seen it getting worse and worse and worse,\u201d said Asos chief executive Nick Robertson. To restore its place in the ultra-competitive fast-fashion market, Asos is introducing country-specific pricing to free it from the resurgent pound. The retailer has introduced country-specific pricing in Australia and France and plans to extend it to other countries from mid-January. \u201cWe will forever be playing with pricing to make sure we are competitive in all markets,\u201d said Robertson. The pricing plan is expected to eat into future profits: Asos has told investors its quarterly sales margin in future years would be 4%, compared with earlier forecasts of 5-6%. In the three months ending 30 November, international sales fell to \u00a3141.5m, a 2% drop on the previous year. But it was a different story in the UK, where retail sales rose 24% to \u00a3104.8m over the same period, driven by demand for ripped black jeans, sequin-spangled tops and novelty bags. Anusha Couttigane, senior fashion consultant at Conlumino, said the new pricing system would help Asos win back custom from international users, but cautioned that domestic customers were likely to subsidise international sales for some time to come. Unlike many high-street rivals, Asos was less affected by the UK\u2019s unseasonably warm autumn, because it sells more party clothes than coats and jumpers. The company was also boosted by Black Friday; it took seven orders a second on the discount day, propelling it to its best-ever trading week. Robertson said Asos had recovered from a fire in its main warehouse in June which cost it \u00a325m-\u00a330m in lost sales. In this latest reporting period, Asos collected \u00a36.3m in insurance payouts, which it is using to help pay for the new pricing plan in foreign markets. The cash injection allows the company to maintain expectations it can earn \u00a346m in profits in 2015. But investors reacted angrily to the decision not to count the \u00a36.3m as profit, sending Asos shares down 5% to 2,251 pence.",

      "bodyText": "Battered UK supermarket group Tesco has warned that profits will be substantially lower than expected, its fifth profits warning in 12 months. Shares in the group tumbled as much as 16% in early trading to 156p \u2013 a 14\u2013year low \u2013 and shares in other supermarket groups were also under pressure, with Morrisons falling 6% and Sainsbury\u2019s down 4%. The grim announcement shows the crisis at Britain\u2019s biggest retailer is far from over and underscores what has been a disastrous year for the group. Tumbling sales and profits have coincided with a criminal investigation into accounting irregularities, and the resignation and sacking of a number of senior executives. The group\u2019s chief executive, Dave Lewis, who took over on 1 September, said he expected trading profit for the year ending February 2015 would be no more than \u00a31.4bn. This is substantially below market expectations, which ranged from \u00a31.8bn to \u00a32.2bn, and a huge fall on the \u00a33.3bn profits recorded last year. However, he warned investors there were no quick fixes and short-term profits would suffer. Lewis, who marks his 100th day in the job on Tuesday, said he was building \u201ca new Tesco\u201d that would eventually reward shareholders. \u201cWe need to get back to core principles. We need to improve the service and availability and that is what we are doing.\u201d Under pressure to show the City how he will revive the UK\u2019s No 1 supermarket, Lewis promised to present his strategy to investors on 8 January. At its peak, \u00a31 in every \u00a37 spent in the UK went into a Tesco till, but customers are deserting the retailer in droves for cheaper rivals. Restoring Tesco\u2019s fortunes would be \u201ca long journey\u201d, Lewis said, but \u201cthere are reasons to be quietly optimistic\u201d. The company has cut prices on 1,000 core groceries and has seen \u201cencouraging volume growth\u201d as a result. He insisted his plans would pay off in the long-run, despite short-term pain for shareholders. \u201cIt is a difficult time for the business. None of us would argue with that. But there is a recognition we are doing the right thing for the business.\u201d In a bid to improve customer service, the retailer has taken on 6,000 more staff since mid-October, and despatched 6,000 existing head office staff to spend one day a fortnight on the shop floor to get a taste for the sharp end of the grocery business. Lewis has decided not to lay off people after Christmas, a traditionally slack time for retailers, as part of this customer service drive. \u201cCertain activities help you manage profits, but can have a detrimental impact on how you serve customers,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we are trying to do is deliver better for customers \u2026 I believe that is the foundation from which we can build a new Tesco, which is financially attractive to shareholders.\u201d All 900 Tesco staff who handle negotiations with suppliers have been retrained, in the wake of the accounting scandal that involved moving forward supplier payments to paint a more flattering picture of the store\u2019s finances. Tesco is being investigated by the Serious Fraud Office over the scandal after it admitted it had overstated its profits by \u00a3264m, leading to the resignation of the Tesco chairman, Sir Richard Broadbent, and the departure of a number of senior executives. Richard Hunter, head of equities at Hargreaves Lansdown Stockbrokers, said Tesco\u2019s latest trading update provided further ammunition for those sniping about the group\u2019s strategy. \u201cAmidst the accounting mishap, the revolving door in the boardroom and an unforgiving attack from the discount retailers, investors have simply lost interest in waiting for a recovery story which still seems some way off.\u201d He pointed out that even before today\u2019s announcement, Tesco\u2019s share price had fallen by 44% over the past year, compared to a 2% rise for the wider FTSE100. The food retailer index was down 0.6%, according to veteran analyst Nick Bubb, reflecting investor concern that Tesco\u2019s rivals will be forced to embark on their own price-cutting campaigns.",
