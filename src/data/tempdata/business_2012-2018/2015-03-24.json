      "bodyText": "Hands up who wants to sue Tesco? If that sounds like fun, and if you were a Tesco shareholder last September, a US legal outfit called Scott + Scott wants to hear from you. It says the supermarket chain\u2019s \u00a3263m overstatement of profits last year caused \u201ca permanent destruction of value to shareholders\u201d. It thinks compensation is due \u2013 lots of it. It\u2019s talking 50p to 70p per share, which is roughly \u00a35bn. What a load of nonsense. Or, more politely, this intended claim is an import from American litigation culture that we could happily live without. There are at least three reasons why sensible Tesco shareholders should tell Scott + Scott to find other ways to chase fees. First, shareholders own Tesco, so they would, in effect, be making a claim against themselves. In practice, of course, life doesn\u2019t work so simply. One set of shareholders \u2013 the litigiously minded \u2013 would be hoping to benefit at others\u2019 expense. That is unfair. Second, how does one measure \u201ca permanent destruction of value\u201d? Tesco\u2019s share price is 20% higher today than it was on the day the company confessed to the overstatement. Of course, it might have been higher still if profits had been stated accurately in the first place. But how can one hope to separate a permanent and a temporary loss of value? It\u2019s impossible. Third, the appropriate bodies to investigate a profit overstatement by a major quoted company are the Serious Fraud Office and the Financial Reporting Council. Both are on the job and their findings are awaited eagerly, not least by Tesco\u2019s former bosses and its auditors. In the meantime, Tesco shareholders should take a stand against litigation creep. There will be times when it is right to sue companies that have made serious accounting mistakes. This is not one. Remarkable? No \u201cThe rate of change that we have seen in FTSE 100 companies over the last four years has been remarkable,\u201d says Lord Davies, the government\u2019s champion of women on boards. A near-doubling, to 23.5%, in women\u2019s representation is indeed worth cheering. But \u201cremarkable\u201d is overdoing it. Davies\u2019 own target, set in his 2011 report, was 25% by 2015. In other words, his theoretical deadline for one-quarter representation passed three months ago, which is not quite so impressive. Still, the target should be met this year, which is perhaps the main thing. But the idea that the rest of the corporate world would follow the FTSE 100 firms\u2019 lead must also be viewed as a work in progress. Among the biggest companies, the percentage of women in executive roles has risen from 5.5% to 8.6% since 2011; but among the medium-sized FTSE 250 companies, the ratio is unchanged at 4.6%. Indeed, almost one in 10 FTSE 250 firms do not have a women on their board in either an executive of non-executive role. There are still a lot of corporate laggards out there. There is progress but the rate of improvement could have \u2013 and should have \u2013 been faster. Funny thing, franchises Infrequent observers of the French DIY scene may have assumed that Mr Bricolage was already hard at work for Kingfisher. The B&amp;Q owner announced the purchase of the chain almost exactly a year ago. That would seem to leave plenty of time to square the local competition regulators and get a modest \u20ac275m (\u00a3200m) deal over the line. Apparently not. Kingfisher\u2019s strange statement on Tuesday said the board of Mr Bricolage plus 42% shareholder ANPF, which holds the franchisees\u2019 interests, \u201chave reservations in relation to the transaction\u201d. It\u2019s a bit late to develop cold feet, surely. This was supposed to be a binding deal subject only to competition clearance, which doesn\u2019t seem to be the problem. Neither side is saying (yet) what the \u201creservations\u201d are, so definitive judgments will have to wait. But Mr Bricolage is mainly a franchise operation. If franchisees really don\u2019t fancy a change of ownership, new Kingfisher chief executive V\u00e9ronique Laury will have to think carefully about trying to cajole them. A volunteer is worth two pressed men, they say, and an enthusiastic franchisee is worth more than a reluctant one. Election energy Do you want to be holding Centrica shares on 8 May? asks Deutsche Bank. Its answer is no if there is a Labour government. That\u2019s hardly a revelation given that Ed Miliband has proposed cutting retail energy prices by 10%. But Deutsche\u2019s valuation gap is still eye-catching. It reckons the owner of British Gas could be worth 20% less under a Labour-led government than a Conservative one. And under an \u201caggressive\u201d Labour government, the downside for Centrica could be 40%. Make up your own mind whether these estimates are accurate.

      "bodyText": "OK, that\u2019s all for tonight. A quick reminder of the key points. Greece\u2019s former finance minister, George Papaconstantinou has received a suspended jail sentence after being convicted of tampering with the list of suspected Greek tax evaders handed to Athens by Christine Lagarde. Greece\u2019s government is racing to put together a comprehensive reform plan to satisfy its creditors. The government says it should have it ready by Monday at the latest. Analyst fear that Greece could run out of cash on April 20, without a deal. Greece\u2019s prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, has met with left-wing opposition leaders on the second day of his visit to Berlin. He also visited the Holocaust Memorial. There are signs that relations with Germany are thawing; foreign minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier says the atmosphere has improved \u201csignificantly\u201d. George Osborne, though, has told MPs that the ill-feeling between Greece and its eurozone neighbours is \u201cpalpable\u2019, making Grexit more likely. And George Soros has claimed there\u2019s a 50% chance that Greece leaves the euro. In other news... Supermarket price wars and falling petrol prices have helped pull the UK inflation rate down to 0.0%. It\u2019s a cost of living boost, but may make it harder for workers to get sizeable pay rises after years of wage squeezes. Here\u2019s Larry Elliott\u2019s analysis. US inflation has also come in at zero. And there is hope that Europe\u2019s economy is recovering, after private sector growth hit a near four-year high. We\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Goodnight all. GW Back to the Athens courtroom.... And a court official told Helena that: \u201cThis is as close to a acquittal as would be possible in the circumstances,\u201d The one-year sentence handed down to George Papaconstantinou was suspended for three years. Papaconstantinou, in a dark suit, has told friends he is \u201crelieved.\u201d The former finance minister had always protested his innocence and said he had been framed by a political establishment bent on finding convenient scapegoats to distract public attention from the crisis Greece was enduring. One other piece of news....The Financial Times is reporting that the European Central Bank is set to make it illegal for Greek lenders to add to their holdings of government debt. That would appear to make it impossible for Greek banks to provide Athens with extra funding to tide it through its cash flow crisis. The FT says: The governing council of national central bank governors and top ECB officials have waved through a proposal tabled by supervisors at the central bank to make legally binding their recent warnings to Greek banks against loading up on their sovereign\u2019s short-term debt, or t-bills, according to two people familiar with the matter. Athens special court has just handed down a one year suspended sentence to former finance minister George Papaconstantinou, reports Helena Smith. Court sources have told Helena that of the 13 judges, five (including the presiding judge Nikos Passos) were in favour of acquitting Papaconstantinou over charges that he had tampered with the list of Swiss bank account holders. The court (still deliberating over the sentence) accepted George Papaconstantinou\u2019s \u201cprior life\u201d as a mitigating factor. Addressing the wood-panelled court, the prosecutor proposed a sentence of four years..... Court officials say it is almost certain that George Papaconstantiniou will not \u201cspend a night\u201d in jail, despite being convicted tonight of tampering with the Lagarde List. Helena Smith our correspondent says the former minister smiled when the presiding judge read out the judgement. Associated Press also believes Papaconstantiniou will avoid a custodial sentence. Greek Court officials have now adjourned to deliberate on sentencing, following George Papaconstantinou\u2019s conviction a few moments ago. Our Helena Smith has been told that as the tampering charge is a misdemeanour and not a felony, it will be regarded as a lighter crime. Papaconstantinou is the first cabinet minister to be brought before a special tribunal in more than two decades. Breaking News! Former Greek finance minister George Papaconstantinou has been found guilty of tampering with the infamous \u201cLagarde list\u201d of suspected tax evaders by special criminal court. But Athens correspondent Helena Smith also reports that Papaconstantinou was exonerated of another charge, of breach of duty for not acting on the list handed to him by Christine Lagarde, the current IMF chief, who was then finance minister of France. Papaconstantinou was in power when country\u2019s debt crisis erupted and widely regarded as the architect of Greece\u2019s first EU-IMF bailout programme. He was accused of removing the names of three of his relatives from the list of some 2062 wealthy Greeks with Swiss bank accounts. After a few days out of the spotlight, Yanis Varoufakis surfaced at the presidential palace in Athens today for talks with Prokopis Pavlopoulos. Pavlopoulos said he plans regular meetings with Greece\u2019s finance minister. That may dampen media chatter that Varoufakis is been sidelined after not joining Tsipras on his Berlin trip. What better way to mark your birthday? (many happy returns of the day, Mr Varoufakis!). The atmospherics may have improved dramatically after last night\u2019s talks but the Greek prime minister\u2019s still faces the enormous challenge of \u201cchanging the narrative\u201d among his own constituency, writes Helena Smith. Officials hope that some of last night\u2019s feel good politicking will rub off on relations between German finance minister Wolfgang Schauble and his Greek counterpart Yanis Varoufakis. \u201cIn terms of atmospherics the [Merkel-Tsipras] meeting went very well. Both countries can now return to the substance of the matter at hand rather than reciprocal finger-pointing,\u201d said the economics analyst Jens Bastian, a former member of the EU task force for Greece, speaking from the German capital. \u201cThe hope is that both [Schauble and Varoufakis] can follow suit so that a constructive dialogue can return to the euro group of finance ministers instead of the bitterness and wrangling that we have seen during the past weeks.\u201d Bastian, who is German but lives in Greece, said the Tsipras government had had a \u201charsh meeting\u201d with reality. \u201cIt is gradually starting to govern driven not by ideology but the institutional requirements of such a reality check.\u201d \u201cDissent within Syriza is going to be the big challenge for the Greek prime minister. The leadership he has shown in Berlin will have to be repeated in terms of explaining the reality on the ground in Athens, the need for structural reforms, to his own rank and file.\u201d Tsipras\u2019 meeting with Merkel marked the first time a Greek prime minister had said openly in Berlin that the Germans weren\u2019t responsible for the crisis, he said. \u201cThat is important for the narrative both between the two countries but also in terms of domestic politics in Greece, in particular inside the governing Syriza party.\u201d Bastian told the Guardian. Another Reuters newsflash, suggesting signs of progress... EUROGROUP HEAD DIJSSELBLOEM ASKS EURO ZONE BAILOUT FUND TO ANALYSE POSSIBLITY OF REFUNDING \u20ac1.2bn TO GREECE - FUND\u2019S SPOKESMAN Speaking of Greece.... a verdict is expected soon in the trial of former finance minister Giorgos Papakonstantinou. Papakonstantinou is accused of removing the names of relatives from the Lagarde list of suspected Greek tax evaders, a charge he denied. A Greek government insider has told Reuters that the country would run out of funds on April 20th without additional help from its lenders. That suggests Greece can handle the next hurdle; the \u20ac467m due to the IMF on April 9th. but would then be close to the brink. GREECE TO RUN OUT OF MONEY BY APRIL 20 WITHOUT FRESH FINANCIAL AID - SOURCE FAMILIAR WITH MATTER GREECE HOPES TO GET \u20ac1.9bn IN ECB PROFITS ON GREEK BONDS, \u20ac1.2bn OF BANK RESCUE FUNDS IF EUROGROUP APPROVES REFORMS LIST-SOURCE The Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, has warned MPs that the risk of Greece leaving the euro is rising. Testifying to the Treasury committee, Osborne claimed that the \u201cill will\u201d around the table at recent EU meetings has been palpable. Osborne also warned, though, that a Grexit could cause severe disruption. He cited the example of Black Wednesday when Britain was driven out of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism. Once you have established the fact that a pegged currency can be broken\u2026.. the markets and others will seek to test that. Greece is not the only weak economy in the eurozone. Osborne is also discussing last week\u2019s Budget -- you can follow the action in our Politics Live blog. More US data just hit the wires.... and it\u2019s encouraging. New home sales have jumped by almost 8% to 539,000, the most in almost seven years. Two pieces of new economic news have given rather different views of the US economy. First, growth in America\u2019s factory hit a five-month high, echoing the strong data from the eurozone this morning. Markit\u2019s US manufacturing PMI jumped to 55.3 this month from 55.1 in February, with new orders rising at the fastest rate since last October. But then..... the Richmond Federal Reserves\u2019s measures of manufacturing activity in its region tumbled to -8, from zero last month. Cue another ripple through the foreign exchange markets.... Greek media are reporting that a Euro Working Group [made up of technical officials] will assess the country\u2019s situation on a conference call tomorrow morning. And.....the euro is continuing to slide. The US dollar experienced dramatic swings as traders digested the news that US inflation rose to zero last month. As Ashraf Laidi, Chief Global Strategist at Cityindex.com, it\u2019s still not clear whether the Federal Reserve will feel confident to raise interest rates soon: The fact that core CPI (excluding volatile food and energy items) edged up to 1.7% from 1.6%, helps explain that the disinflation-bound trend in US retail prices is largely driven by the oil declines, which suggests that a continue stabilization in energy prices could lift headline CPI back towards the 1.0% level. Yet, it would take an unlikely sharp and prolonged rally in oil prices in order for headline CPI to approach the Fed\u2019s 2.0% objective and pave the way for a lift off in US interest rates. Yesterday\u2019s Merkel-Tsipras meeting makes the front pages in Germany too: Over in Greece, the media reaction to last night\u2019s meeting between Alexis Tsipras and Angela Merkel is generally positive. But behind the scenes, some members of Tsipras\u2019s government aren\u2019t happy. Helena Smith reports from Athens: Greek newspapers this morning may have seen prime minister Alexis Tsipras\u2019 visit to Berlin as a much-needed ice-breaker \u2013 with the government friendly Efimerida ton Syntakton hailing it as a \u201ccivil partnership\u201d\u2013 but in Athens the battling lines are being drawn within the leader\u2019s Syriza party. Panagiotis Lafazanis, the energy minister who as head of the party\u2019s militant wing, the Left Platform is effectively the number three in the government, reacted with fury this morning to the prospect of the national electricity company DEH, being privatised. A united and public DEH was non-negotiable, he says. \u201cTo privatize it would be a catastrophe for the economy,\u201d he said adding that the leftist-led government\u2019s goal was an exit from the crisis by pursuing policies of job-creating growth. Lafazanis insisted: \u201cThe government is trying to open positive paths for the people so that their income can return to pre-memorandum levels. It\u2019s a titanic quest and it will be achieved whatever the pressures, threats, blackmailing and difficulties.\u201d The intervention underscored the difficulties the ruling coalition is likely to face when it is forced to vote legislation through parliament. Speculation in Athens is rising that Tsipras may have to dump his far left comrades and seek backing from other pro-reform parties \u2013 but we are a long way off from that yet. HS Just in: US inflation was zero on an annual basis last month, matching the UK\u2019s reading this morning. But in America\u2019s case, that\u2019s actually an increase from the -0.1% CPI recorded in January. Prices increased by 0.2% on a month-on-month basis, reversing a 0.7% tumble in January, as fuel prices picked up. And core inflation, which strips out volatile elements, has risen to 1.7%. That suggests inflationary pressures may be increasing - putting a summer interest rate rise back on the agenda, perhaps. Alexis Tsipras has also visited the Holocaust Memorial in Berlin today, as part of his first visit as Greek prime minister. The FT\u2019s Gideon Rachman has heard that Germany could provide some financial aid to Greece, in recognition of the horrors of the second world war. That may be related to the Future Fund, which was set up last year to address the issue. Greece\u2019s prime minister tweets that he\u2019s met with the leaders of Germany\u2019s left-wing opposition parties, a day after his talks with Angela Merkel. Time to turn back to the Greek debt crisis. And German foreign minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier has told reporters in Berlin that relations between the two counties have improved. Steinmeier (who has met with Alexis Tsipras today), said: \u201cI\u2019m pleased that the atmosphere in German-Greek talks in recent days has changed and improved significantly. And that warming of relations should help \u201cserious talks\u201d begin about Greece\u2019s debts, he added. Here\u2019s Angela Monaghan\u2019s news story on UK inflation: And here\u2019s Larry Elliott\u2019s full analysis: The TUC is also concerned about the underlying state of the UK economy. General secretary Frances O\u2019Grady said: \u201cZero inflation is a reminder of how fragile the economy remains. Stagnating prices are not a sound foundation for the strong and sustained pay rises that workers have waited so long for. \u201cWith deflation on the horizon, the Chancellor\u2019s plans for extreme cuts after the election look more and more like a suicide note for the UK economy.\u201d Worth remembering that the Bank of England\u2019s task is to keep inflation at 2% in the medium-term, not at zero.... With the election just 44 days away, the opposition Labour party isn\u2019t giving the government much credit for Britain\u2019s inflation data. Cathy Jamieson MP, Labour\u2019s Shadow Treasury minister, says: \u201cInflation is falling around the world because global oil prices have plummeted, yet in Britain wages continue to be sluggish. \u201cWorking people are \u00a31,600 a year worse off under this government. And another Tory VAT rise if David Cameron wins the election will hit living standards and send prices rising again. \u201cA few months of falling world oil prices won\u2019t solve the deep-seated problems in our economy. We need Labour\u2019s better plan to build a more productive economy so we can earn our way to sustained rises in living standards and so get the deficit down too.\u201d Some historical context: The prime minister and chancellor shouldn\u2019t be too complacent about the dangers of deflation, argues Ranko Berich, Head of Market Analysis at Monex Europe. He points to the fact that price rises have slowed, or started falling, across the economy (see earlier chart). George Osbourne and David Cameron have been quick to write off the \u2018noflation\u2019 as purely a symptom of lower fuel prices, pointing to the positive aspects of low inflation for British households. While this argument certainly has some weight, today\u2019s data also showed year-on-year deflation in five categories, including food, as well as slower price increases across many others. This suggests that the UK could well be succumbing to the wave of low inflation that has swept the eurozone, and a sustained period of deflation remains a key risk. David Kern, Chief Economist at the British Chambers of Commerce, also predicts that Britain\u2019s inflation rate will fall below zero: \u201cThese historically low figures reinforce our belief that inflation will fall into slightly negative territory in the coming months, before returning to a positive trend before the end of the year. However, we remain convinced that there is very little risk of a long period of deflation. \u201cInflation in the service sector, which accounts for 80% of the UK economy, remains firmly above the government\u2019s 2.0% target, and core CPI inflation in February was 1.2%. Together with higher earnings, lower inflation is boosting people\u2019s spending power, and will contribute to economic growth in the year ahead. \u201cTo sustain business confidence we need a firm commitment from the MPC to keep interest rates on hold until at least early 2016.\u201d Danielle Haralambous, UK analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit, agrees that we should welcome this period of no-flation. \u201cThe likelihood that we are on the verge of a period of deep and prolonged deflation in the UK remains slim. Recent deviations in inflation from target have been largely driven by lower food and energy costs, which will provide a welcome boost to real household incomes and support prospects for the demand-driven recovery.\u201d Spot the pattern: A wider measure of inflation, the retail prices index, also fell last month. But unlike CPI, RPI showed that prices rose by around 1.0% annually. That\u2019s the lowest since November 2009. The drop in inflation has driven the London stock market to a new record high. The FTSE index has jumped by another 24 points, or 0.35%, to 7062. The pound has weakened, hitting a one-month low against the euro at \u20ac1.36, down from \u20ac1.365 yesterday. Both moves show that traders believe UK monetary policy will remain extremely loose for some time. Last week, indeed, the Bank of England\u2019s chief economist Andy Haldane suggested that an interest rate cut is as likely as a rise. The elimination of inflation, however temporarily, is simply good news for the UK, argues Rob Wood of Berenberg Bank: Cheaper imports, petrol and food are unmitigated good news for consumers and growth, which shows up in high consumer confidence..... He reckons there\u2019s little danger of Britain suffering full-blown deflation - a protracted period of falling prices, when people are reluctant to spend. The UK can sit back and enjoy the purchasing power boost that low inflation today is bringing without fearing any of the sillier claims of what \u2018deflation\u2019 might bring, like households delaying purchases on the expectation that prices will be even lower tomorrow. The drop in inflation to zero means that living standards are going up, and interest rates are going nowhere soon. And it may mean that pay rises will be less generous. Our economics editor Larry Elliott explains: Britain is on the cusp of a period of deflation. It is the first time on record that inflation, measured by the consumer prices index, has hit zero, since the measure was created in 1989. This has three implications, two of them obvious, one less easy to assess. The first is that living standards will rise. Average earnings are growing by just less than 2% a year, so with prices not rising at all people will find their wages and salaries go further. The second implication is that there is likely to be a further delay before the Bank of England raises interest rates. The latest fall in inflation came as no surprise to Threadneedle Street but its nine-strong monetary policy committee is going to be in no hurry to raise the cost of borrowing. That\u2019s because it will want to see what zero inflation does to wage bargaining. At the moment, it is assumed that the fall in the cost of living is temporary and that inflation will pick up later this year. But it would be a different story if low inflation led to less generous pay settlements. If that were to happen, deflation could become tough to shift, as has been the case in Japan. \u201cWe are looking for a couple of months of deflation in the UK\u201d, predicts Jeremy Cook, chief economist at the international payments company, World First. Enjoy no-flation while you can. The CBI\u2019s director of economics, Rain Newton-Smith, reckons it\u2019s a temporary situation: \u201cDespite inflation dropping to zero, it is unlikely we will see falling prices for a prolonged period, particularly as the pressure from lower oil prices fades. There\u2019s little chance of the Bank of England raising interest rates anytime soon, Newton-Smith adds. Chancellor George Osborne gives some of the credit to the falling oil price..... ...before following up with another of his witty puns. The drop in inflation means that real incomes in the UK continues to rise, after declining for several years. British pay packets are rising by 1.8% annually (or 1.6% excluding bonuses) according to the latest data. So with inflation at zero, so are real incomes. The prime minister has leapt on the news: Economists reckon that the UK is now heading into a period of negative inflation: This table confirms that food and transport costs dragged inflation down to zero: And this chart is a reminder that inflation spent most of the last seven years above the official target of 2%, before its recent slide: This is the first time on record that the consumer prices index has hit zero, according to figures going back to 1989. The ONS suggest that inflation may have been lower in 1960, though, according to Reuters. The drop in inflation was caused by a big drop in food prices, which fell by 3.4% in the year to February. Motor fuels tumbled by 16.6%, due to the sharp fall in oil prices in recent months. The Office for National Statistics also attributes the fall to: \u201cprice movements for a range of recreational goods (particularly data processing equipment, books and games, toys &amp; hobbies), food and furniture &amp; furnishings.\u201d This is a bigger fall in inflation than expected. Economists had predicted that the consumer prices index would slide to just 0.1% in February, down from 0.3% in January. But instead, CPI has come in at exactly zero. Breaking: The UK inflation rate has fallen to zero for the first time on record. More to follow..... France is lagging behind the rest of the eurozone for job creation, and output growth, according to Markit\u2019s new PMI survey. Economists are cheering the news that the eurozone private sector is growing at the fastest rate since May 2011: The eurozone recovery is alive and well. Firms across the euro are growing much faster than expected this month, according to Markit\u2019s latest survey of the sector. The eurozone composite PMI, just released, smashed expectations by jumping to 54.1 this month, up from 53.6 in February. That\u2019s the highest reading since May 2011, driven by a recovery in the service sector. As mentioned earlier in the blog, Germany is growing at its fastest rate for 10 months, while growth in France eased back. But importantly, the rest of the eurozone is enjoying strong growth; new order growth and job creation was both the strongest since mid-2007. It suggests the eurozone economy is picking up pace, and should get another boost from the European Central Bank\u2019s new quantitative easing programme. \uf0a7Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit said: \u201cThe eurozone\u2019s economic recovery gained further momentum in March, with the PMI hitting its highest for almost four years. The improvement provides welcome news to a region awaiting signs that the ECB\u2019s quantitative easing is stimulating the real economy. Deflationary pressures \u2018eased\u2019 this month, Williamson says, suggesting the eurozone will avoid a deep deflationary spiral. He adds: The survey data therefore indicate that the ECB\u2019s quantitative easing has been started at a time when the eurozone\u2019s economic upturn is already starting to gain traction. This augurs well for the region to enjoy further improvements in business conditions as the year proceeds, helping drive greater business investment and hiring, and thereby ensuring that the recovery becomes sustainable. The euro has jumped half a cent against the US dollar on the back of the news that the German economy is accelerating. Not that it\u2019s a huge shock. Strong economic data from Germany - its private sector is growing at the fastest rate in eight months. The German composite PMI has risen to 55.3, from 53.8 in February - meaning 23 months of consecutive growth. Manufacturing and services both grew at a faster rate. Germany is entering the \u201cdomestic fast lane again\u201d, says Markit economist Oliver Kolodseike. Hopes that France\u2019s economy was recovering have just taken a knock. Markit\u2019s monthly healthcheck of the sector shows that growth in France\u2019s private sector slowed this month. The French composite PMI fell to 51.7 this month, down from 52.2 in February [where any reading over 50 = growth]. Service sector expansion slowed, while factory output continued to fall. The data implies a \u2018modest\u2019 rise in GDP this quarter, Markit says. Billionaire philanthropist George Soros has declared there\u2019s a 50:50 chance that Greece will leave the eurozone, due to the mistakes of the past. Soros made the comments in an interview with Bloomberg, being broadcast later today. In it, he warned that: \u201cIt\u2019s now a lose-lose game and the best that can happen is actually muddling through....Greece is a long-festering problem that was mishandled from the beginning by all parties.\u201d The 84-year old, who famously beat the Bank of England on Black Wednesday, also said that the deadlock between Greece and its creditors is hurting its economy badly. As a result, \u201cGreece is going down the drain.\u201d More details here: Soros Says Greece Is Now \u2018Lose-Lose Game\u2019 After Being Mishandled Greece\u2019s three-year government bonds are strengthening, a little, on the back of today\u2019s comments from Athens, and from Martin Schulz: Yields are still very high, around 21%, implying a high risk of default. Another optimistic sign - European Parliament chief Martin Schulz has predicted that Greece and its creditors could secure a breakthrough this week. He told Italy\u2019s La Repubblica that: \u201cI think by the end of this week a new deal will be reached that should be sufficient to release the most urgent financing,\u201d Greece would then have \u201cnot more than three months\u201d to present a \u201ccredible, detailed and definitive\u201d plan, Schulz added. That makes sense; Greece\u2019s current bailout extension runs until the end of June. Alexis Tsipras is still in Berlin, and due to meet with the leaders of Germany\u2019s opposition Left and Green parties. Germany\u2019s Deutsche Welle newspaper reports that Angela Merkel and Alexis Tsipras spoke until almost midnight about the situation in Europe, at their \u2018working dinner\u2019 Chancellor Merkel\u2019s spokesman Steffen Seibert told reporters late last night that: \u201cThe chancellor and the Greek prime minister had a comprehensive discussion in a good and constructive atmosphere about the situation in Greece, the procedures of the European Union and future German-Greek cooperation,\u201d News from Athens: Greece will present a new reform programme to its creditors by next Monday, potentially unlocking bailout funds and averting the risk of bankruptcy. The news comes less than 12 hours after prime minister Alexis Tsipras and Angela Merkel ended their talks in Berlin. Reuters has the details: Greece will present its proposed package of reforms to its euro zone partners by next Monday in hopes they will release much needed cash, its government spokesman said on Tuesday. \u201cIt will be done at the latest by Monday,\u201d government spokesman Gabriel Sakellaridis told Mega TV. Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras met with German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin on Monday but it was unclear if they had narrowed differences on economic reforms Athens must implement to win urgently to get fresh aid from its creditors. Sakellaridis said the package of reforms Athens will propose will not contain recessionary measures but structural changes. He said Tsipras and Merkel on Monday discussed the outline of the reforms but did not go into depth. \u201cI believe points of convergence were found,\u201d Sakellaridis said. Time is short; on April 9th , Greece must repay \u20ac467m to the International Monetary Fund. If it does convince its creditors next week, then they could unlock some of the \u20ac7.2bn bailout tranche which is being withheld. This could call for another crunch meeting in Brussels..... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Today we\u2019ll be assessing the situation in Greece after yesterday\u2019s visit by Alexis Tsipras to meet Angela Merkel. The two leaders struck a fairly conciliatory tone during last night\u2019s press conference [even though Tsipras mentioned the war reparations], but there\u2019s no sign yet of a breakthrough deal to unlock fresh funds for Greece. In the UK, we get the latest inflation data at 9.30am \u2013 and economists reckon it could fall to just 0.1% as low energy costs ripple through the economy. On the economic side, the latest PMI surveys are being released this morning (from 8am to 9am GMT) They are expected to show the eurozone\u2019s manufacturing and service sectors continuing to expand this month as the slow recovery continues. We\u2019ve already had downbeat news from China -- its factory activity has fallen to an 11-month low, suggesting its economy is slowing down. More stimulus could be needed.... European stock markets are expected to dip this morning. I\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day....",

It is the first time on record that inflation, measured by the consumer prices index, has hit zero, since the measure was created in 1989. This has three implications, two of them obvious, one less easy to assess.</p> <p>The first is that living standards will rise. Average earnings are growing by just less than 2% a year, so with prices not rising at all people will find their wages and salaries go further.</p> <p>The second implication is that there is likely to be a further delay before the Bank of England raises interest rates. The latest fall in inflation came as no surprise to Threadneedle Street but its nine-strong monetary policy committee is going to be in no hurry to raise the cost of borrowing.</p> <p>That\u2019s because it will want to see what zero inflation does to wage bargaining. At the moment, it is assumed that the fall in the cost of living is temporary and that inflation will pick up later this year. But it would be a different story if low inflation led to less generous pay settlements. If that were to happen, deflation could become tough to shift, as has been the case in Japan.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-551136b4e4b0545750d5c87b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-03-24T10:06:47.783Z\">10.06am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>\u201cWe are looking for a couple of months of deflation in the UK\u201d, predicts <strong>Jeremy Cook</strong>, chief economist at the international payments company, <strong><a href=\"http://www.worldfirst.com/\">World First</a>.</strong></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-55113550e4b0aedd80e3da01\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-03-24T10:03:48.087Z\">10.03am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Enjoy no-flation while you can. </strong></p> <p>The CBI\u2019s director of economics, Rain Newton-Smith, reckons it\u2019s a temporary situation:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cDespite inflation dropping to zero, it is unlikely we will see falling prices for a prolonged period, particularly as the pressure from lower oil prices fades.</p> </blockquote> <p>There\u2019s little chance of the Bank of England raising interest rates anytime soon, Newton-Smith adds.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-551134a3e4b09cf44ffd4e2a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-03-24T09:57:20.081Z\">9.57am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Chancellor George Osborne gives some of the credit to the falling oil price.....</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/George_Osborne/statuses/580306814107062273\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Inflation at zero is a first for the British economy.

The notoriously erratic Circle, Metropolitan, District and the Hammersmith &amp; City lines will get a new train control system by 2022, after Bombardier failed to deliver its promised signalling upgrade. The faster, more frequent services will allow tens of thousands more passengers per hour to travel on the Tube. The lines comprise about 40% of the network. Tube bosses said a signals upgrade for the century-old system would allow Circle line trains to run every 4 minutes. The system will be installed by Thales, the company that modernised the Victoria line, although details of the deal have not been finalised or released. Transport for London terminated Bombardier\u2019s contract in 2013, writing off \u00a385m already paid to the Canadian group.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Greece has pledged to pull together a comprehensive list of reforms by the start of next week, in an attempt to unlock fresh funds before Athens runs out of cash in April. Government spokesman Gabriel Sakellaridis said on Tuesday that the programme demanded by Greece\u2019s increasingly impatient creditors would be finished within days. \u201cIt will be done at the latest by Monday,\u201d Sakellaridis told Mega TV, potentially teeing up another crunch meeting in Brussels to decide Greece\u2019s future within the eurozone. Although Greece\u2019s financial position remains perilous, there are signs that Alexis Tsipras\u2019s visit to Berlin on Monday improved ties between the eurozone\u2019s largest member and its smaller, indebted neighbour. The German foreign minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, declared that relations between the two countries have improved. \u201cI\u2019m pleased that the atmosphere in German-Greek talks in recent days has changed and improved significantly,\u201d Steinmeier told reporters in Berlin. Greek government bonds strengthened on Tuesday on hopes of a breakthrough. The yield on Greece\u2019s two-year debt fell from nearly 22% to 20%, a level that still suggests a high risk of default or restructuring. The UK chancellor, George Osborne, gave an insight into how toxic relations had become in recent weeks as Athens tried to break away from its austerity programme. \u201cThe risks of Greece leaving are rising, because the ill-will around the table is palpable between the eurozone and Greece,\u201d Osborne told parliament\u2019s Treasury select committee. Britain must be prepared for the danger that Greece leaves the eurozone through \u201caccident \u2026 or misjudgment\u201d, Osborne added. The billionaire investor-turned-philanthropist George Soros also remained gloomy, claiming there is a 50:50 chance that Greece will eventually leave the eurozone. \u201cIt\u2019s now a lose-lose game and the best that can happen is actually muddling through,\u201d Soros told Bloomberg, adding that: Greece is a long-festering problem that was mishandled from the beginning by all parties. Greece must present a credible list of reforms to its creditors soon, to unlock the \u20ac7.2bn (\u00a35.3bn) of bailout funds still available under its existing financial programme. Its financial position remains very fragile, with \u20ac467m due to be repaid to the IMF on 9 April. One source told Reuters that Greece would run out of funds by 20 April without additional help. There are signs that the wider eurozone economy is recovering. The region\u2019s private companies are now growing at the fastest rate since May 2011, according to Markit\u2019s latest survey of the sector. New order growth and job creation in the periphery, excluding Germany and France, was both the strongest since mid-2007. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, says the eurozone\u2019s economic recovery \u201cgained further momentum in March\u201d. The improvement provides welcome news to a region awaiting signs that the ECB\u2019s quantitative easing is stimulating the real economy.",

      "bodyText": "New Morrisons boss David Potts has sacked half of his most senior management team as he tries to turn around the embattled supermarket group. The drastic action comes a week after Potts started work at the grocer, where he has been charged with halting the supermarket\u2019s slump. Aside from the chief executive and finance director, the grocer\u2019s 10 most senior executives sit on the group\u2019s management board and five will now leave the company. They are customer marketing and digital director Nick Collard; retail director Martyn Fletcher; property and strategy director Gordon Mowat; logistics director Neal Austin; and convenience managing director Nigel Robertson. Those leaving include two executives brought in by Potts\u2019 predecessor, Dalton Philips, and one Morrisons \u201clifer\u201d who has worked at the chain for more than 20 years. In a short statement Potts, who spent 38 years at Tesco before quitting in 2011, said: \u201cI will now be constructing a leaner management board, with the aim of simplifying and speeding up the business. I would like to thank Nick, Martyn, Neal, Nigel and Gordon for their service to Morrisons.\u201d However, observers said that if Potts had merely wanted to slim down the management board, he could have done so without asking anybody to leave. One said: \u201cIf it was just streamlining, he could have stripped the jobs from the management board. There was clearly an element of performance.\u201d The retailer added that Ross Eggleton and Miles Foster will continue to be in charge of logistics and its M convenience chain, respectively. Meanwhile, Andy Atkinson becomes marketing director and Clare Grainger is made retail director, both on an interim basis. Morrisons declined to say how large the management board would be when further replacements arrive, whether or not Potts aspires to assemble a more diverse senior team than the nine white men and one white woman he inherited, or how high the bill for paying off those departing would be. However, Morrisons did stress there was no undisclosed scandal that triggered the departures. The new chief executive is now one of three former Tesco executives running the Bradford-based grocer, alongside the new chairman, Andrew Higginson, and the finance director, Trevor Strain. He was hired on an \u00a3850,000 a year salary after Philips was sacked in January following the supermarket\u2019s poor Christmas performance. Potts has not only been dispensing with the services of top executives. On Monday, the company said it was axing its so-called \u201cintelligent queue management system\u201d \u2013 which used infrared sensors to determine where checkout queues were getting too long \u2013 after it turned out not to be quite so intelligent after all.",

However, importantly, Game maintained or gained market share in the UK and Spain. There are a number of growth initiatives (Game Wallet, Marketplace, mobile portal etc), which should augment growth in 2016, but with a weaker run rate into the third quarter and few major releases in the fourth quarter, we reduce 2015 projected revenues by \u00a315m, cutting Ebitda from \u00a351.3m to \u00a348.0m, while a higher tax charge means pretax profit comes down from \u00a341.9m/19.5p to \u00a338.8m/17.5p, a 10% downgrade. Meanwhile Benedict Smith - who helped the company\u2019s turnaround which led to last year\u2019s flotation - will step down as chief financial officer later this year to join a private equity backed business.",

      "bodyText": "Inflation has fallen to zero for the first time on record in Britain, boosting incomes in real terms and handing the chancellor a pre-election advantage. The consumer prices index dropped in February from 0.3% in January, bringing the UK to the brink of a spell of deflation that is expected in the coming months. Economists had forecast a smaller drop to 0.1% but a deep oil price slump and a fierce price war being fought out by supermarkets brought fuel prices down by 16.6% over the year and cut food prices by 3.4%, according to the Office for National Statistics. Confirmation that prices were flat over the year allowed Chancellor George Osborne to question Labour\u2019s claim that the UK is in the midst of a cost of living crisis. Osborne said zero inflation was \u201ca first for the British economy\u201d and good news for family budgets. Taking to Twitter to mock Labour, he added: \u201cPrices are frozen and as the recovery from Labour\u2019s Great Recession strengthens, their economic argument has literally come to nought.\u201d Real terms pay fell for six straight years between 2008 and 2014, as inflation consistently outpaced wage growth. However, that trend has been in reverse since late 2014 giving households a boost. The latest figures showed wage growth running at 1.8% including bonuses in the three months to January. The consumer prices index \u2013 Britain\u2019s official inflation measure \u2013 has not fallen to zero since comparable records began in 1989. However, unofficial estimates suggest it might have been lower in 1960. Overall price falls are expected later in the spring as the global oil price slump continues to feed through to lower prices at the petrol pump and cuts in some utility bills. A lower oil price also cuts costs for manufacturers and food producers. The strength of the pound against the euro, the UK\u2019s main trading partner, makes imports cheaper and could also bring down inflation in the coming months. Inflation was last close to the Bank of England\u2019s 2% target in June 2014, when it registered 1.9% and the latest figures keep any rise in interest rates firmly off the table. \u201cUK inflation is dead,\u201d declared Vicky Redwood, chief UK economist at Capital Economics after the figures were published. \u201cThe UK is now within a whisker of deflation. It looks odds-on that inflation will turn negative in March, when the cut in gas prices by British Gas will show up in the inflation figures for the first time. \u201cInflation is then likely to remain around zero/slightly negative for the rest of the year.\u201d She added: \u201cWe still think deflation in the UK will be a \u2018good\u2019 development, giving household incomes a welcome boost and supporting the economic recovery this year.\u201d The latest spell of weak price pressures in the UK has triggered a division of opinion at the very top of the Bank of England. Mark Carney, the Bank\u2019s governor, has argued that while the country should experience overall falling prices during spring, Britain is not heading for the dangerous deflationary spiral feared in the eurozone. Deflation can become entrenched and difficult to escape once businesses and consumers delay spending plans because they expect prices to fall further still. However, the Bank\u2019s chief economist, Andy Haldane, said last week that in his view, policymakers could be underestimating the threat. As a result of inflation \u201cdropping like a stone\u201d, he said it could prove necessary for interest rates \u2013 already at an all-time low of 0.5% \u2013 to be cut further. Carney, on the other hand, has argued that responding to the recent fall in inflation with a rate cut would be \u201cextremely foolish\u201d. It suggests that the Bank\u2019s nine-strong rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee is becoming ever more divided on the appropriate timing of the first rise in interest rates, which have been on hold at their historic low since March 2009. As recently as December, two members of the MPC \u2013 Martin Weale and Ian McCafferty \u2013 voted for a 0.25 point rate hike, before dropping the call in January and at subsequent meetings. In China, expectations are mounting that the central bank will pump further stimulus into the economy after the latest signs of a slowdown. Activity in China\u2019s factories was the slowest in 11 months in March as new orders fell. The HSBC/Markit China manufacturing PMI dropped to 49.2 from 50.7 in February, where anything below 50 indicates contraction. It was weaker than expected, with economists polled by Reuters forecasting 50.6 for the PMI.",

      "bodyText": "Tesco is facing a new threat of legal action as a US law firm asks British shareholders to join a group seeking billions of pounds in compensation for losses relating to the supermarkets\u2019 profits overstatement last year. Tesco Shareholder Claims Limited (TSC), a group funded by US litigation firm Scott + Scott, said on Tuesday it aims to bring an action against Tesco on behalf of institutional shareholders, arguing that the retailer\u2019s profit overstatement \u201ccaused a permanent destruction of value to shareholders\u201d. The potential legal battle comes after Tesco\u2019s admission last September that first-half profits had been artificially inflated by \u00a3250m because income from suppliers had been mis-stated. The grocer later raised that figure to \u00a3263m and admitted the accountancy problems went back at least two years after an internal investigation led by accountancy firm Deloitte. . The overstatement combined with poor performance in Tesco\u2019s stores at home and abroad to prompt a sharp decline in the market value of Britain\u2019s biggest retailer. Tesco\u2019s share price dived to a 14-year low as the Serious Fraud Office and the Financial Reporting Council both launched investigations into the accounting scandal. The grocery industry watchdog, the Groceries Code Adjudicator, is also investigating the firm\u2019s relations with its suppliers. Scott + Scott has already filed a legal claim against Tesco in the US. David Scott, managing partner, said international institutions had asked the firm to find a way to help them launch action in the UK. British law firm Stewarts Law launched a similar move in November, alleging that Tesco directors and senior managers knew or were reckless about whether the firm\u2019s statements to the market were untrue or misleading. John Bradley, chairman of the TSC, said: \u201cTesco is one of the widest held stocks in the UK and this loss has hit pension funds and investors across the UK and beyond. We look forward to bringing this claim to court\u201d. TSC, which will be represented in the UK by McGuire Woods, said: \u201cA permanent destruction of value has occurred and had the accounting irregularities not taken place the share price, and value of the company, would today be materially higher\u201d. The group said it expected the claim, which is open to any institutional shareholder that bought shares in Tesco prior to the firm\u2019s 22 September announcement, to be in the region of 50-70p per share. Tesco has 8.1bn shares listed, suggesting the claim could be for billions of pounds. TSC said it was in talks with institutions in the UK, Europe and the US about joining the claim on a no-win, no-fee basis. It is unlikely the claim will reach court until next year. Tesco declined to comment on the potential legal claims. The latest action against Tesco is part of a new wave of shareholder litigation in the UK. Last year a group of investors filed a claim against Lloyds Banking Group for losses they claim they incurred during the rescue of HBOS in 2008. Meanwhile, hundreds of Royal Bank of Scotland investors, including Standard Life and M&amp;G, are pursuing a claim worth more than \u00a34bn against the bank which they allege misled them during an emergency rights issue in 2008. That effort is being bankrolled by Bentham Europe, which specialises in funding litigation. Bentham is also backing the Stewarts Law action against Tesco. The Investment Management Association, which represents 200 UK asset managers who oversee more than \u00a35tn for their clients, said investors should focus on examining how mistakes happened and could be prevented in future. Daniel Godfrey, chief executive, of the IMA said: \u201cShareholders must have the right to take action for loss against a company but the bar needs to be set high and we should not be encouraging opportunistic class actions. \u201d Shares in Tesco slipped more than 1% to 243.8p on Tuesday, as analysts said that the likely cost of legal action had largely been already taken into account by the market. \u201cThis latest action is not entirely a surprise,\u201d said Bruno Monteyne at Bernstein Research. \u201cThese numbers are very high but seem quite a stretch. Just because someone launches legal action doesn\u2019t mean they are going to be successful. It\u2019s too early for investors to be materially worried at this stage.\u201d",

Bentham is also backing the Stewarts Law action against Tesco.</p> <p>The Investment Management Association, which represents 200 UK asset managers who oversee more than \u00a35tn for their clients, said investors should focus on examining how mistakes happened and could be prevented in future.</p> <p>Daniel Godfrey, chief executive, of the IMA said: \u201cShareholders must have the right to take action for loss against a company but the bar needs to be set high and we should not be encouraging opportunistic class actions. \u201d</p> <p> Shares in Tesco slipped more than 1% to 243.8p on Tuesday, as analysts said that the likely cost of legal action had largely been already taken into account by the market.</p> <p>\u201cThis latest action is not entirely a surprise,\u201d said Bruno Monteyne at Bernstein Research. \u201cThese numbers are very high but seem quite a stretch. Just because someone launches legal action doesn\u2019t mean they are going to be successful. It\u2019s too early for investors to be materially worried at this stage.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Inflation is expected to fall to a fresh record low of just 0.1% when figures are released today, as Britain heads for a period of deflation. A fall in the consumer prices index in February from 0.3% in January would provide a further boost for households already benefiting from falling fuel and food prices. The country is forecast to see overall price falls in the spring as the global oil price slump continues to feed through to lower prices at the petrol pump and some utility bills fall. A lower oil price also cuts costs for manufacturers and food producers. The strength of the pound against the euro, the UK\u2019s main trading partner, makes imports cheaper and could also bring down inflation in the coming months. Inflation was last close to the Bank of England\u2019s 2% target last June, when it registered 1.9%. Vicky Redwood, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said: \u201cTuesday\u2019s inflation figures are likely to show the UK taking another step further towards deflation. \u201cAnd the recent rise in the pound will put additional downward pressure on inflation further ahead.\u201d The latest spell of weak price pressures in the UK has triggered a division of opinion at the very top of the Bank of England, whose remit is to target inflation of 2%. Mark Carney, the Bank\u2019s governor, has argued that while inflation is likely to turn negative during spring, Britain is not heading for the dangerous deflationary spiral feared in the eurozone. Deflation can become entrenched and difficult to escape once businesses and consumers delay spending plans because they expect prices to fall further still. However, the Bank\u2019s chief economist Andy Haldane said last week that in his view, policymakers could be underestimating the threat of UK deflation. As a result of inflation \u201cdropping like a stone\u201d, he said it could prove necessary for interest rates - already at an all-time low of 0.5% - to be cut further. Carney on the other hand has argued that responding to the recent fall in inflation with a rate cut would be \u201cextremely foolish\u201d. It suggests that the Bank\u2019s nine-strong rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee is becoming ever more divided on the appropriate timing of the first rise in interest rates, on hold at their historic low since March 2009.

      "bodyText": "Every time George Osborne announces a minor upwards tweak to the bank levy, a section of the City reacts as if the chancellor has declared an ambition to drive the money-changers out of London\u2019s financial temple. Nigel Wilson, chief executive of insurer Legal &amp; General, took up the cudgels at the weekend. Osborne is \u201crepeatedly going back to the well to extract funds through a bank levy, a move which ultimately risks forcing banks to relocate outside the UK\u201d, he said. JP Morgan Cazenove\u2019s bank analysts even crunched some numbers for Bill Winters, Standard Chartered\u2019s incoming boss, to ponder. The levy will reduce the bank\u2019s earnings by 13% in 2017, they calculate, and thus \u201ca strong case for re-domicile is now on the table\u201d. Really? Where are Standard Chartered and the other supposedly put-upon banks meant to run to? Bailed-out lenders Lloyds Banking Group and Royal Bank of Scotland are clearly going nowhere. The same, almost certainly, applies to Barclays, whose assumed flirtation with the US a few years ago was under a previous management with a greater love of Wall Street. That leaves HSBC and Standard Chartered, the Asian-focused duo. How about Hong Kong? It\u2019s not plausible. Changing domicile requires the board to take a 30-year view, at the minimum. If you think UK politicians are capricious, do you really trust their counterparts in the People\u2019s Republic of China? Of course not: being regulated in a stable democracy is worth a lot to a big bank. Singapore is the usual alternative offered by the emigration lobby. But does Singapore want to house mega-banks? Is it capable of doing so? Standard Chartered has a $725bn balance sheet, big enough to swamp the country in a 2008-style crisis. Singapore, currently reflecting on 50 years of prosperity, would surely demand capital cushions so large that they would undo most of the benefits of escaping the UK levy. The US isn\u2019t likely either. For both HSBC and Standard Chartered, after their run-ins with local regulators in recent years, it would be like stepping into the lion\u2019s den. In any case, what\u2019s the fuss about? Osborne\u2019s justification for raising an extra \u00a3900m a year from the bank levy seems reasonable: during the financial crisis the UK bent over backwards to support the banking industry, not only pure domestic lenders, so he would like the public purse to see a tangible benefit. The current round of grumbling about the levy is pitched at higher volume this time. But one suspects the outcome will be the same \u2013 the banks will conclude that UK regulation is worth paying for. First place Good news for FirstGroup: it\u2019s finally won a rail contract. Sort of. The contract to run the Great Western franchise until April 2019 is actually a direct award from government, rather than a victory in a competition against rival bidders. They all count, of course, and the terms on this one \u2013 just \u00a368m to be paid in premiums \u2013 look attractive. Back in 2011 the company declined to take up an option to pay \u00a3800m over three years to keep the Great Western franchise. Its reward was a cheaper extension. Now it\u2019s got another, thanks to the government\u2019s desire to stick with the incumbent while the line is electrified. No wonder the shares rose 4%. The shadow transport secretary, Michael Dugher, called it a \u201cstitch-up\u201d that \u201cmakes a mockery of the current franchise model\u201d. He\u2019s right, up to a point. The system has been shambolic since the cock-up on the west coast in 2012 when FirstGroup got the gig but Virgin successfully challenged the award. Yet Dugher would do everybody a favour by being clearer about what he means by putting the current franchise system \u201cin the bin\u201d and creating a railway that is \u201cmore publicly controlled\u201d. He\u2019s not talking nationalisation, that much is known. And Dugher wants a public sector operator, or bidder, of some form. But would a Labour-led government, when push comes to shove, really turn down offers from the private sector of, say, \u00a33bn over seven years to operate the upgraded west coast line? That would be serious money. You would have to be very confident indeed that your in-house operator could do a better job. Checking out Morrisons has decided something called \u201cthe intelligent queue management system\u201d is not very intelligent after all. It is binning infrared sensors and letting staff use their eyes to decide when to open and close checkouts. Call it a small victory for common sense. In fact, it\u2019s astonishing that Morrisons persevered for six years with an obviously duff idea.",
