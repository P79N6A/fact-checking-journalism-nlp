The report from the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, released on Tuesday, dissects a corporate restructure by Adani Enterprises and its impact on the Carmichael proposals. \u201cIEEFA views the Carmichael proposal as commercially unviable and no longer consistent with the financial interests of the Adani Group,\u201d the report said. The restructure includes a demerger of Adani Ports and Adani Power.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The chief executive of McDonald\u2019s admitted on Monday that the world\u2019s largest burger chain is \u201cnot on our game\u201d as he announced sweeping changes designed to revitalise the company which is rapidly losing customers to a new breed of customer-focused fast-food chains. \u201cThe reality is our recent performance has been poor. The numbers don\u2019t lie,\u201d Steve Easterbrook, McDonald\u2019s new president, said on Monday as he ripped up the company\u2019s global corporate structure in a plan to \u201cshape McDonald\u2019s future as a modern, progressive burger company\u201d. Easterbrook, a Briton who took over as chief executive on 1 March, said he would \u201creturn excitement to our proposition and brand\u201d. In a 23-minute video he said: \u201cThe message is clear we are not on our game \u2026 We must improve, or we will be selling our customers short and leaving open opportunities for competitors.\u201d Easterbrook said he was \u201cnot interested in average for this business\u201d and the company needed more \u201chard-edged accountability\u201d. The 47-year-old father-of-three, who has billed himself as an \u201cinternal activist\u201d and \u201cconstructive agitator\u201d, said the corporate structure of McDonald\u2019s had made it too slow to respond to the needs of its 69m daily customers. \u201c[We need] sharper focus on the customer,\u201d he said. \u201cSharper focus on what they want.\u201d Easterbrook told the Guardian that being \u201cprogressive\u201d meant the company would be \u201canticipating the needs of our customers tomorrow\u201d. \u201cThis was all about making sure we are nimble and anticipating trends,\u201d he said. \u201cProgressive means we offer a compelling pay [package] for our staff.\u201d He refused to answer questions about whether the company would increase workers\u2019 wages beyond a recent pledge to lift company-owned (rather than franchised) restaurant workers\u2019 pay to $9.90, up from an average of $9.01. On Monday, McDonald\u2019s workers announced plans to gatecrash the shareholder meeting later this month with \u201cthe biggest-ever protest\u201d demanding an end to \u201cpoverty wages\u201d paid to its staff. Easterbrook warned investors that it would take time for his planned changes to have an effect on the company\u2019s financial performance. McDonald\u2019s has reported six straight quarters of sagging sales, depressed profits and another miserable outlook; 2014 was one of the worst years in its 60-year history. \u201cWhile we continue our efforts to regain business momentum through our turnaround plan and improve sales at our more than 36,000 restaurants around the world, our current performance reflects the ongoing pressures of the business, which we expect to persist through at least the first half of the year,\u201d Easterbrook said. \u201cWe are taking decisive and necessary action to drive foundational improvements in the business and position the company for long-term growth.\u201d The plan was met with skepticism by investors and analysts. The credit agency Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s cut its rating on McDonald\u2019s from \u2018A\u2019 to \u2018A-\u2019. \u201cWe believe the new CEO is focused on a wide range of initiatives. Still, the competitive environment is fierce even as the restaurant segment seems to be benefiting from lower gas prices,\u201d S&amp;P\u2019s analysts said. Larry Light, a former McDonald\u2019s chief marketing officer and current chief executive of the marketing consultancy firm Arcature, told CNBC: \u201cBased on this presentation, I\u2019d defy anyone to figure out what they want the brand to be when it grows up. When it came to a discussion on the brand, there were glittering generalities but no specifics.\u201d Another former McDonald\u2019s executive, Jerry Langley, said: \u201cSteve Easterbrook is addressing a major issue for the company \u2013 the menu complexity and its impact on customer service \u2013 and, given time to implement, I think we\u2019ll see positive impacts. I also like his restructuring of the organization. \u201cIt will allow management to focus on the existing large markets that make up the majority of revenues, as well as doing special things to focus on the smaller and developing markets that have different needs. Nothing \u2018major\u2019 here \u2013 just redefining how they do business, with the customer in mind.\u201d The geographic structure will be replaced by one that groups countries by the challenges they face. From 1 July the new structure will consist of four groups: the US (its largest market representing 40% of sales), international lead markets (Australia, Britain, Canada, France and Germany), high-growth markets (such as China, Russia and South Korea) and foundation markets (the rest of the world where the company will take a step back in favour of increased franchising). \u201cToday we are announcing the initial steps to reset and turn around our business,\u201d he said. \u201cAs we look to shape McDonald\u2019s future as a modern, progressive burger company, our priorities are threefold: driving operational growth, returning excitement to our brand and unlocking financial value. \u201cAs we turn around our business, we will look to create more excitement around the brand and ensure that we build on our rich heritage of positively impacting the communities we serve. We are taking decisive and necessary action to drive foundational improvements in the business and position the company for long-term growth.\u201d Fight for $15, the union-backed group lobbying McDonald\u2019s for wage hikes, said the company\u2019s moves would not alter its plans to hold what it hopes will be the largest protest outside the company\u2019s Chicago headquarters later this month. Last year\u2019s protest led to 101 arrests. \u201cWe may not have a seat in the room, but we\u2019re sure that McDonald\u2019s will hear us when we say that its turnaround needs to include investment in and respect for its employees,\u201d said McDonald\u2019s worker Adriana Alvarez. The company also plans to cut $300m in costs by about 2017. The company said it was too early to say how that would affect jobs. It will also increase the proportion of restaurants franchised globally over the next four years to 90% from 81%. The new corporate structure will be led by: Mike Andres, who will continue as president; McDonald\u2019s US, Doug Goare, president McDonald\u2019s Europe, will become president of international lead markets; Dave Hoffmann, president of McDonald\u2019s Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa (APMEA) will become president of high-growth markets. Ian Borden, chief financial officer of the APMEA region, will become president of foundational markets. McDonald\u2019s shares were down 0.9% to $96.93 at 1.30pm ET.",

The numbers don\u2019t lie,\u201d Steve Easterbrook, McDonald\u2019s new president, said on Monday as he ripped up the company\u2019s global corporate structure in a plan to \u201cshape McDonald\u2019s future as a modern, progressive burger company\u201d. </p> <p>Easterbrook, a Briton who took over as chief executive on 1 March, said he would \u201creturn excitement to our proposition and brand\u201d. In <a href=\"https://mcdonalds.webcasts.com/viewer/event.jsp?ei=1063465\">a 23-minute video</a> he said: \u201cThe message is clear we are not on our game \u2026 We must improve, or we will be selling our customers short and leaving open opportunities for competitors.\u201d</p> <p>Easterbrook said he was \u201cnot interested in average for this business\u201d and the company needed more \u201chard-edged accountability\u201d.</p> <p>The 47-year-old father-of-three, who has billed himself as an \u201cinternal activist\u201d and \u201cconstructive agitator\u201d, said the corporate structure of McDonald\u2019s had made it too slow to respond to the needs of its 69m daily customers.</p> <p>\u201c[We need] sharper focus on the customer,\u201d he said. \u201cSharper focus on what they want.\u201d</p> <p>Easterbrook told the Guardian that being \u201cprogressive\u201d meant the company would be \u201canticipating the needs of our customers tomorrow\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThis was all about making sure we are nimble and anticipating trends,\u201d he said. \u201cProgressive means we offer a compelling pay [package] for our staff.\u201d</p> <p>He refused to answer questions about whether the company would increase workers\u2019 wages beyond a recent pledge to lift company-owned (rather than franchised) restaurant workers\u2019 pay to $9.90, up from an average of $9.01. </p> <p>On Monday, McDonald\u2019s workers announced plans to gatecrash the shareholder meeting later this month with \u201cthe biggest-ever protest\u201d demanding an end to \u201cpoverty wages\u201d paid to its staff. </p> <p>Easterbrook warned investors that it would take time for his planned changes to have an effect on the company\u2019s financial performance. McDonald\u2019s has reported six straight quarters of sagging sales, depressed profits and another miserable outlook; 2014 was one of the worst years in its 60-year history.</p> <p>\u201cWhile we continue our efforts to regain business momentum through our turnaround plan and improve sales at our more than 36,000 restaurants around the world, our current performance reflects the ongoing pressures of the business, which we expect to persist through at least the first half of the year,\u201d Easterbrook said. \u201cWe are taking decisive and necessary action to drive foundational improvements in the business and position the company for long-term growth.\u201d</p> <p>The plan was met with skepticism by investors and analysts. The credit agency Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s cut its rating on McDonald\u2019s from \u2018A\u2019 to \u2018A-\u2019.</p> <p>\u201cWe believe the new CEO is focused on a wide range of initiatives. Still, the competitive environment is fierce even as the restaurant segment seems to be benefiting from lower gas prices,\u201d S&amp;P\u2019s analysts said. </p> <p>Larry Light, a former McDonald\u2019s chief marketing officer and current chief executive of the marketing consultancy firm Arcature, told <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/id/102645163\">CNBC</a>: \u201cBased on this presentation, I\u2019d defy anyone to figure out what they want the brand to be when it grows up. When it came to a discussion on the brand, there were glittering generalities but no specifics.\u201d</p> <p>Another former McDonald\u2019s executive, Jerry Langley, said: \u201cSteve Easterbrook is addressing a major issue for the company \u2013 the menu complexity and its impact on customer service \u2013 and, given time to implement, I think we\u2019ll see positive impacts. I also like his restructuring of the organization. </p> <p>\u201cIt will allow management to focus on the existing large markets that make up the majority of revenues, as well as doing special things to focus on the smaller and developing markets that have different needs. Nothing \u2018major\u2019 here \u2013 just redefining how they do business, with the customer in mind.\u201d</p> <p>The geographic structure will be replaced by one that groups countries by the challenges they face. From 1 July the new structure will consist of four groups: the US (its largest market representing 40% of sales), international lead markets (Australia, Britain, Canada, France and Germany), high-growth markets (such as China, Russia and South Korea) and foundation markets (the rest of the world where the company will take a step back in favour of increased franchising).<br></p> <p>\u201cToday we are announcing the initial steps to reset and turn around our business,\u201d <a href=\"http://news.mcdonalds.com/Corporate/Press-Releases/Financial-Release?xmlreleaseid=123065\">he said.</a> \u201cAs we look to shape McDonald\u2019s future as a modern, progressive burger company, our priorities are threefold: driving operational growth, returning excitement to our brand and unlocking financial value.</p> <p>\u201cAs we turn around our business, we will look to create more excitement around the brand and ensure that we build on our rich heritage of positively impacting the communities we serve. We are taking decisive and necessary action to drive foundational improvements in the business and position the company for long-term growth.\u201d</p> <p>Fight for $15, the union-backed group lobbying McDonald\u2019s for wage hikes, said the company\u2019s moves would not alter its plans to hold what it hopes will be the largest protest outside the company\u2019s Chicago headquarters later this month. Last year\u2019s protest led to 101 arrests.<br></p> <p>\u201cWe may not have a seat in the room, but we\u2019re sure that McDonald\u2019s will hear us when we say that its turnaround needs to include investment in and respect for its employees,\u201d said McDonald\u2019s worker <a href=\"http://www.refinery29.com/2015/04/85666/fight-for-15-mcdonalds-minimum-wage\">Adriana Alvarez</a>.</p> <p>The company also plans to cut $300m in costs by about 2017. The company said it was too early to say how that would affect jobs. It will also increase the proportion of restaurants franchised globally over the next four years to 90% from 81%.</p> <p> The new corporate structure will be led by: Mike Andres, who will continue as president; McDonald\u2019s US, Doug Goare, president McDonald\u2019s Europe, will become president of international lead markets; Dave Hoffmann, president of McDonald\u2019s Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa (APMEA) will become president of high-growth markets. Ian Borden, chief financial officer of the APMEA region, will become president of foundational markets.</p> <p>McDonald\u2019s shares were down 0.9% to $96.93 at 1.30pm ET. </p>",

As the company announced plans to turn around its ailing business, Fight for $15, a union-backed protest group, set out plans for a day of protest at the company\u2019s Chicago headquarters. \u201cFed up with pay that drives them to rely on public assistance to support their families and angry over the publicity stunt disguised as a wage increase, McDonald\u2019s workers will insist that the fast-food giant include in its turnaround plan a serious investment in the cooks and cashiers who make its billions in profits possible,\u201d Fight for 15 said in a statement on Monday. The workers, who organised protests in cities across the US last month calling for a $15 an hour minimum wage, said they \u201cwould not be coming alone\u201d to McDonald\u2019s annual shareholder meeting on 21 May but would be \u201carmed with 1m signatures from everyday Americans calling on McDonald\u2019s to pay workers $15 an hour and respect their freedom to join together in a union\u201d. Adriana Alvarez, one of 101 McDonald\u2019s workers arrested during a protest at McDonald\u2019s shareholder meeting last year, said: \u201cWe may not have a seat in the room, but we\u2019re sure that McDonald\u2019s will hear us when we say that its turnaround needs to include investment in and respect for its employees.\u201d Alvarez, who has worked at McDonald\u2019s for five years, said she is paid so little that she needs food stamps and Medicaid to care for her three-year-old son, Manny. \u201cI can\u2019t pay my bills and support my son off the poverty wages that I make. That is why I am here fighting for $15 an hour \u2013 and union rights,\u201d she said in a video message released on Monday as McDonald\u2019s new chief executive announced his plan to turn around the company, which is rapidly losing customers. Alvarez said she and her colleagues had decided to gatecrash McDonald\u2019s annual meeting at its headquarters on the outskirts of Chicago because \u201cthat\u2019s where they decided what to do with their money.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve worked hard and we\u2019ve walked a long path to get here,\u201d she said. \u201cNow it\u2019s time for McDonald\u2019s to make the right choice \u2013 to do the right thing for their workers.\u201d As part of his plans to revitalise the company, the new president and CEO, Steve Easterbrook, said on Monday that he was aiming to turn McDonald\u2019s into a \u201cmodern, progressive burger company.\u201d Easterbrook did not directly address the wages McDonald\u2019s pays to its workers in his own video address on Monday, but he did say that McDonald\u2019s needed to be more \u201cprogressive\u201d and address the company\u2019s \u201csocial values\u201d. Easterbrook later told the Guardian that being \u201cprogressive\u201d meant the company offered \u201ccompelling pay\u201d for its staff. He said McDonald\u2019s had made \u201creally purposeful commitments\u201d on pay, training and benefits. Within weeks of taking over as chief executive earlier this month, Easterbrook announced plans to increase its US staff\u2019s minimum wage to $9.90, from the current average hourly wage of $9.01. The Fight for 15 movement dismissed this as not enough.",

      "bodyText": "Allen Simpson is knocking on doors on Hardy Street, a Victorian terrace in Maidstone, Kent. Labour\u2019s candidate for Maidstone and the Weald is canvassing for support and reminding any potential Labour voters to go to the polling booths on Thursday. Simpson\u2019s chances of victory are slim, as are the rewards for his canvassing efforts \u2013 most knocks go unanswered, a number who come to the door are babysitters. A couple of doors shut abruptly when Simpson introduces himself. So far, so normal in a town where Labour came a distant third in 2010 and Ukip has gained ground. But what makes Simpson\u2019s unflagging efforts to represent Labour unusual is that in his day job he is a high-achieving policy adviser at Barclays. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to have Tiggerish tendencies to do this,\u201d Simpson admits. Simpson leads the corporate banking public policy team at Barclays, the bank described by Peter Mandelson back in 2010 as the unacceptable face of the industry and later the first of many to be fined for Libor rigging. It was the public outrage which followed that \u00a3290m penalty in 2012 that prompted the establishment of the parliamentary commission on banking standards, which resulted in a string of new rules for the industry. And more penalties are to follow: only last week Barclays paved the way for \u00a32bn of fines for manipulation of foreign exchange markets. Simpson analyses political and regulatory proposals, directs research and comment, and writes speeches for senior figures including the chief executive Antony Jenkins, who was promoted following the Libor scandal with a remit to repair the bank\u2019s reputation. But the view of the City of London as overrun with hard-nosed Tories is a caricature, Simpson says. There are more Labour supporters than people would expect. \u201cI\u2019ve been surprised by how many people have come up to me and said: \u2018Oh, I\u2019m Labour.\u2019 They are high-flying managing directors and heads of things.\u201d Before joining Barclays in early 2012, Simpson spent almost four years in a similar job at the London Stock Exchange. He joined Labour about seven years ago but says he has been a supporter \u201cfor ever\u201d. Simpson, who is 32 and grew up in Maidstone, says there is no contradiction between providing political advice to City firms and standing for Labour. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have joined the City if I didn\u2019t think there was something fundamentally valuable about financial services,\u201d he says, drinking a coffee at the town centre Wetherspoon\u2019s. \u201cSomething people have to come to terms with is that it is possible to be a social democrat and to believe that markets are the best way of delivering wealth.\u201d Simpson says he is standing for Labour because the party has always been more progressive on social matters such as women\u2019s rights and racial equality. He says the Tories have \u201cmisunderstood what poverty is and what it means\u201d. Drawing on his experience growing up on a neglected council estate, he says: : \u201cThere is a tendency on the right to think all you have to do is work hard, but if you are in a second-generation unemployed family you don\u2019t know how to work hard.\u201d Clare Kattner, who lives on Hardy Street and has not decided who to vote for, says she has no problem with Simpson\u2019s role in the City. \u201cIt means he works for a living and he knows how to get his hands dirty. At least [bankers] know what it\u2019s like to work in the real world.\u201d Simpson does not quite admit that he cannot win on Thursday but says he understands why the party has not funded or given much support for his campaign. The real race in Maidstone this year is between the sitting Conservative MP Helen Grant and the Liberal Democrats\u2019 Jasper Gerard. Simpson has an agent and about 10 volunteers, but he says he has lost 10kg in the past month walking 10 miles a day to meet voters. Simpson has spent \u00a35,000 of his own money on the campaign and has raised a further \u00a33,000 from supporters in the City. \u201cI think they hope that one day I will be an MP or a minister and they think I would be good at it,\u201d he says, stressing that the donors are not buying influence \u2013 they just like him. In Battersea, south-west London, far more is at stake for Labour, but the candidate is again a seemingly unlikely one. The party is working furiously to win back the seat after losing it to the Tories in 2010. Labour\u2019s candidate here is Will Martindale, also 32, and like Simpson, in banking. Unlike Simpson, however, Martindale has had visits from Ed Miliband and just about all Labour\u2019s big names. He has 254 volunteers, which he thinks is the biggest number of any candidate in the country. Martindale joined the party aged 18 and went to work for JP Morgan, the US bank, as a trainee from university. A maths graduate, he worked in the arcane world of credit derivatives just at the time the financial system collapsed. He saw at first hand how banks\u2019 systems for valuing risky securities had failed. After leaving to work on Margaret Hodge\u2019s campaign to defeat the British National party\u2019s Nick Griffin in Barking in 2010, and spending three months helping the families of genocide victims in Rwanda, he did a two-year stint at French bank BNP Paribas. He then quit finance again to become head of policy at United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment, an initiative set up by former UN secretary general Kofi Annan to encourage long-term and more ethical ways of investing. Drinking a healthy juice round the corner from his campaign office on Lavender Hill, Martindale says bad things happened in banking but that the debate in Britain is simplistic. He was caught out last year at a discussion about making the City work better when he made headlines with what he says was intended as a jokey remark about how Labour needed to \u201chug a banker\u201d to get the City onside. \u201cIt\u2019s either: \u2018The market knows best\u2019 or: \u2018Bankers are greedy and they should all be locked up,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople I worked with were truly ashamed at what had happened in the financial sector and they felt it had been tainted for a generation.\u201d Battersea, he says, demonstrates the extremes that have built up in Britain in recent years. It is one of the country\u2019s richest constituencies, but also has many people in deep poverty. More than 1,500 people rely on food banks, including 600 children. Martindale says even natural Conservative supporters are getting behind his message that social divisions have got out of control. \u201cYou may be on the right side of the equation but the disparity here is incredibly uncomfortable.\u201d A poll published by Lord Ashcroft last week, however, gave the Tories with a 12-point lead in Battersea. Martindale and Simpson both argue that Labour leader Ed Miliband is right to call for limits on the size of big banks and for the creation of more lenders with a greater regional focus. Martindale says the bosses who line up to attack Miliband have little credibility and that such stunts obscure a less-hostile relationship between Labour and business. \u201cSome readers might be surprised by the level of support for the Labour party there was within the financial sector,\u201d he says.",

A couple of doors shut abruptly when Simpson introduces himself.</p> <p>So far, so normal in a town where Labour came a distant third in 2010 and Ukip has gained ground. But what makes Simpson\u2019s unflagging efforts to represent Labour unusual is that in his day job he is a high-achieving policy adviser at Barclays.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to have Tiggerish tendencies to do this,\u201d Simpson admits.<br></p> <p>Simpson leads the corporate banking public policy team at Barclays, the bank described by Peter Mandelson back in 2010 as the unacceptable face of the industry and later the first of many to be fined for Libor rigging. It was the public outrage which followed that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jun/27/barclays-chief-bob-diamond-bonus-fine\">\u00a3290m penalty in 2012</a> that prompted the establishment of the parliamentary commission on banking standards, which resulted in a string of new rules for the industry. And more penalties are to follow: only last week Barclays paved the way <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/apr/29/barclays-sets-aside-further-1bn-forex-rigging-ppi-mis-selling\">for \u00a32bn of fines for manipulation of foreign exchange markets</a>.</p> <p>Simpson analyses political and regulatory proposals, directs research and comment, and writes speeches for senior figures including the chief executive Antony Jenkins, who was promoted following the Libor scandal with a remit to repair the bank\u2019s reputation.</p> <p>But the view of the City of London as overrun with hard-nosed Tories is a caricature, Simpson says. There are more Labour supporters than people would expect.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been surprised by how many people have come up to me and said: \u2018Oh, I\u2019m Labour.\u2019 They are high-flying managing directors and heads of things.\u201d</p> <p>Before joining Barclays in early 2012, Simpson spent almost four years in a similar job at the London Stock Exchange. He joined Labour about seven years ago but says he has been a supporter \u201cfor ever\u201d.</p> <p>Simpson, who is 32 and grew up in Maidstone, says there is no contradiction between providing political advice to City firms and standing for Labour.</p> <p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have joined the City if I didn\u2019t think there was something fundamentally valuable about financial services,\u201d he says, drinking a coffee at the town centre Wetherspoon\u2019s. \u201cSomething people have to come to terms with is that it is possible to be a social democrat and to believe that markets are the best way of delivering wealth.\u201d </p> <p>Simpson says he is standing for Labour because the party has always been more progressive on social matters such as women\u2019s rights and racial equality.</p> <p>He says the Tories have \u201cmisunderstood what poverty is and what it means\u201d. Drawing on his experience growing up on a neglected council estate, he says: : \u201cThere is a tendency on the right to think all you have to do is work hard, but if you are in a second-generation unemployed family you don\u2019t know how to work hard.\u201d</p> <p>Clare Kattner, who lives on Hardy Street and has not decided who to vote for, says she has no problem with Simpson\u2019s role in the City. \u201cIt means he works for a living and he knows how to get his hands dirty. At least [bankers] know what it\u2019s like to work in the real world.\u201d</p> <p>Simpson does not quite admit that he cannot win on Thursday but says he understands why the party has not funded or given much support for his campaign. </p> <p>The real race in Maidstone this year is between the sitting Conservative MP Helen Grant and the Liberal Democrats\u2019 Jasper Gerard.</p> <p>Simpson has an agent and about 10 volunteers, but he says he has lost 10kg in the past month walking 10 miles a day to meet voters.<br></p> <p>Simpson has spent \u00a35,000 of his own money on the campaign and has raised a further \u00a33,000 from supporters in the City. </p> <p>\u201cI think they hope that one day I will be an MP or a minister and they think I would be good at it,\u201d he says, stressing that the donors are not buying influence \u2013 they just like him.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1ad34fe08e416b60edd60aaca1aec91efa46fafa\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/4/1430755344534/6b98aab7-169d-4dcc-bbe8-52fdbaa4045f-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Will Martindale, Labour candidate for Battersea, south-west London.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Will Martindale, Labour candidate for Battersea, south-west London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graham Turner/Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In Battersea, south-west London, far more is at stake for Labour, but the candidate is again a seemingly unlikely one. </p> <p>The party is working furiously to win back the seat after losing it to the Tories in 2010.

    "webTitle": "TalkTalk raises prices again", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "TalkTalk is putting up prices for home phone, broadband and TV customers, just seven months after it last raised its landline and call charges. The telecoms firm, which has built a customer base of 4m homes by undercutting the likes of BT and Sky, spent the bank holiday weekend sending out emails informing customers their bills would be rising again. From 1 June TalkTalk is increasing the cost of all its monthly broadband/TV packages by \u00a31.50 a month or \u00a318 a year. Those on its basic Simply Broadband deal are hit hardest \u2013 their monthly charge will rise from \u00a33.50 to \u00a35 a month, a 43% increase. Customers on its popular TV Essentials deal will have their monthly bill increased to \u00a310 a month. Perhaps the biggest change \u2013 despite it not featuring prominently in the emails to customers \u2013 is that from 1 July calls to 0845 and 0870 numbers (those used by the banks and utility firms) will no longer be included in the calling packages that many customers have signed up to. Calls to 0845 numbers can often last a long time as customers are kept on hold and the change is likely to add significantly to bills. The company is also scrapping free local calls for the small number of customers who are not on one of its evening and weekend and/or anytime call plans. TalkTalk said customers can continue to receive a 19% discounted call rate on a single 0845 number of their choice, although many customers who rely on the phone package are unlikely to be placated since the change follows the company\u2019s move in December to raise its line rental from \u00a315.95 a month to \u00a316.70 a month, and increase call charges. The popular Anytime UK Calls boost \u2013 which included all calls to other landlines \u2013 went up from \u00a35 a month to \u00a37.50 a month, although calls to mobiles were added for the first time. The move will leave some customers wondering whether two bill increases a year represent the future from what used to be Britain\u2019s best-value broadband provider. It also comes a few months after the company was at the centre of a data breach that let fraudsters target customers \u2013 and in some cases led to the loss of thousands of pounds. The increases are also further evidence that telecoms firms have felt able to raise prices irrespective of the mood in the wider economy. BT, Sky and now TalkTalk have all raised prices significantly faster than inflation in recent years \u2013 in part to pay for the hugely expensive battles over sports TV rights. Supermarket price wars and low oil prices have kept annual inflation at zero for the past two months. TalkTalk said: \u201cWe\u2019re committed to providing Britain\u2019s best-value TV, broadband, calls and mobile as well as the best service possible \u2026 Over the past year we\u2019ve made our broadband smarter, faster and more reliable, while also adding more great entertainment to TalkTalk TV. In making these improvements, some prices will increase.\u201d She said customers on existing discounts will see those deals honoured, albeit at the new level. Customers can leave their contract without penalty if they inform TalkTalk within 30 days. TalkTalk customers who were not informed of last December\u2019s price increases will be getting a credit to their account, the company said in emails sent out over the weekend. \u2022 This article was amended on 5 May 2015. An earlier version said TalkTalk was increasing the cost of its monthly broadband/TV packages from 1 July. That date has been corrected to 1 June.",

      "body": "<p>TalkTalk is putting up prices for home phone, broadband and TV customers, just seven months after it last raised its landline and call charges.</p> <p>The telecoms firm, which has built a customer base of 4m homes by undercutting the likes of BT and Sky, spent the bank holiday weekend sending out emails informing customers their bills would be rising again.</p> <p>From 1 June TalkTalk is increasing the cost of all its monthly broadband/TV packages by \u00a31.50 a month or \u00a318 a year. Those on its basic Simply Broadband deal are hit hardest \u2013 their monthly charge will rise from \u00a33.50 to \u00a35 a month, a 43% increase. Customers on its popular TV Essentials deal will have their monthly bill increased to \u00a310 a month. </p> <p>Perhaps the biggest change \u2013 despite it not featuring prominently in the emails to customers \u2013 is that from 1 July calls to 0845 and 0870 numbers (those used by the banks and utility firms) will no longer be included in the calling packages that many customers have signed up to. Calls to 0845 numbers can often last a long time as customers are kept on hold and the change is likely to add significantly to bills. </p> <p>The company is also scrapping free local calls for the small number of customers who are not on one of its evening and weekend and/or anytime call plans. </p> <p>TalkTalk said customers can continue to receive a 19% discounted call rate on a single 0845 number of their choice, although many customers who rely on the phone package are unlikely to be placated since the change follows the company\u2019s move in December to raise its line rental from \u00a315.95 a month to \u00a316.70 a month, and increase call charges. The popular Anytime UK Calls boost \u2013 which included all calls to other landlines \u2013 went up from \u00a35 a month to \u00a37.50 a month, although calls to mobiles were added for the first time. </p> <p>The move will leave some customers wondering whether two bill increases a year represent the future from what used to be Britain\u2019s best-value broadband provider. It also comes a few months after the company was at the centre of a data breach that let fraudsters target customers \u2013 and in some cases led to the loss of thousands of pounds. </p> <p>The increases are also further evidence that telecoms firms have felt able to raise prices irrespective of the mood in the wider economy. BT, Sky and now TalkTalk have all raised prices significantly faster than inflation in recent years \u2013 in part to pay for the hugely expensive battles over sports TV rights. Supermarket price wars and low oil prices have kept annual inflation at zero for the past two months. </p> <p>TalkTalk said: \u201cWe\u2019re committed to providing Britain\u2019s best-value TV, broadband, calls and mobile as well as the best service possible \u2026 Over the past year we\u2019ve made our broadband smarter, faster and more reliable, while also adding more great entertainment to TalkTalk TV. In making these improvements, some prices will increase.\u201d</p> <p>She said customers on existing discounts will see those deals honoured, albeit at the new level. Customers can leave their contract without penalty if they inform TalkTalk within 30 days. </p> <p>TalkTalk customers who were not informed of last December\u2019s price increases will be getting a credit to their account, the company said in emails sent out over the weekend.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 5 May 2015. An earlier version said TalkTalk was increasing the cost of its monthly broadband/TV packages from 1 July. That date has been corrected to 1 June.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Greece has vowed to honour heavy debt repayments over the coming weeks but says it is counting on international creditors to release billions of euros in rescue funds before the end of the month as crisis talks between the two sides grind on. But as the European commission described discussions over the long weekend as constructive, albeit with more work to be done, one Greek minister criticised the International Monetary Fund\u2019s \u201cextreme\u201d demands for austerity cuts. Greece\u2019s creditors are demanding reforms in exchange for bailout money, but the government of the prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, recently elected on an anti-austerity ticket, has said it will resist significant changes to pensions or the labour market. On Monday, the Greek labour minister, Panos Skourletis, singled out the IMF as \u201cinflexible\u201d and \u201cextreme\u201d, saying the creditor was demanding pension cuts and opposing a government plan to raise the minimum wage. \u201cThey are asking us to not touch anything [of the austerity measures] that have ruined Greek people\u2019s lives in the last five years,\u201d Skourletis told Mega TV. \u201cThe IMF is the most inflexible side \u2026 the most extreme voices of the Brussels group\u201d of creditors, he said. \u201cBut there are also calmer voices.\u201d Greece owes money to the Brussels Group \u2013 the IMF, European commission and European Central Bank (ECB) \u2013 following its two bailouts in 2010 and 2012. A further \u20ac7.2bn (\u00a35.3bn) in bailout money is still to be paid out and fears are growing that without it Greece will default on its debts, potentially precipitating the country\u2019s exit from the euro. The most pressing of its obligations are payments to the IMF totalling almost \u20ac1bn by 12 May. But Skourletis tried to sound a note of reassurance that payments would be met. \u201cThe country has chosen to pay its obligations and reach an agreement [with lenders]. We are trying to have the money,\u201d he said. A Greek government spokesman, Gabriel Sakellaridis, said Athens intended to meet all its debt obligations but it needed fresh funds before the end of the month. \u201cLiquidity is a pressing issue,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Greek government is not waiting until the end of May for a liquidity injection. It expects this liquidity to be offered to the Greek economy as soon as possible.\u201d The Greek deputy prime minister, Yannis Dragasakis, is to meet the ECB president, Mario Draghi, in Frankfurt on Tuesday, a day before the central bank\u2019s weekly review of emergency lending to Greece\u2019s banks. Eurozone finance ministers convene on 11 May, and negotiators have been in marathon talks to pave the way to an agreement that could be signed off at the meeting. Athens confirmed on Monday that its finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, will represent Greece at those talks after reports last week that the outspoken economist had been sidelined when Greece\u2019s negotiating team was reshuffled. A spokesman for the European commission sounded a cautiously optimistic note about the preparatory negotiations on Monday. \u201cThe Brussels group has been in session throughout the weekend and continues to be in session. Talks have been constructive but more work remains to be done. The next opportunity for finance ministers to take stock will be the eurogroup of 11 May,\u201d Margaritis Schinas said. There was fresh evidence on Monday of the continued pressure on Greece\u2019s economy as it struggles to avoid bankruptcy. A closely watched report on the eurozone\u2019s manufacturers showed that most enjoyed continued growth in April, but that Greece and France bucked the trend with factories cutting jobs as production fell. Manufacturing growth across the currency zone eased off slightly in April from March\u2019s 10-month high, according to the latest manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) poll by the financial information company Markit. Ireland and Spain led the continued expansion though the pace of growth slipped. Manufacturers also raised average selling prices for the first time since August 2014, news that will reassure policymakers at the ECB after launching a large-scale quantitative easing programme to head off deflation. The PMI report\u2019s headline index slipped to 52.0 in April from 52.2 in March, its 22nd month above the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction. \u201cThe eurozone manufacturing sector continued to grow in April, but the dip in the rate of expansion will serve to check recent optimism that the ECB\u2019s quantitative easing programme has bought a guaranteed ticket to recovery for the region,\u201d Chris Williamson, the chief economist at Markit, said. \u201cWarning lights are flashing, particularly brightly over France and Greece, both of which saw accelerating rates of decline at the start of the second quarter. Weaker rates of growth in Germany and Ireland are also cause for concern.\u201d",
