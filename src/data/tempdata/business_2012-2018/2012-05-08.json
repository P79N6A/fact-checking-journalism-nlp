    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The European executive has responded to the electoral earthquakes in France and Greece by calling for a shift towards growth across the EU as the new firebrand leftist leader in Athens stepped up his country's rebellion against austerity. Alexis Tsipras, the leader of a group of radical Greek leftists that has been charged with trying to form a government, tore into the terms agreed by Athens for a \u20ac130bn bailout, threatening to nationalise the Greek banks and warning that Greece would walk away from its rescue deal with the eurozone. In Brussels, Herman Van Rompuy, the European council's president, called a special summit to be held in a fortnight at which the French president-elect, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, will be able to unveil his proposals for tackling the euro crisis. The European commission supported Hollande's demands for pan-European investment to generate growth and create jobs. \"We are seizing the moment to advance our proposals in the new political climate,\" said Olli Rehn, the commissioner tasked with dealing with the euro crisis, as he accepted that the weekend's elections in France and Greece had changed the face of European politics. Rehn and Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, the commission's president, said it was likely that EU leaders would agree next month to increase the capital of the European Investment Bank by \u20ac10bn, which could be used as collateral to inaugurate large infrastructure \"pilot projects\" on a pan-European scale this year. Hollande campaigned on a similar platform. The commission also says that there is \u20ac82bn in unused structural funds from the EU's medium-term budget which could be tapped to promote growth and jobs. That amounts to a quarter of the EU budget. Its use in this way is likely to run into stiff opposition from national governments. In a further sign that EU leaders are being forced by popular pressure to loosen the austerity that has been the main response to the 30-month debt and currency crisis, Rehn signalled there could be a relaxation of tight fiscal conditions for countries struggling to meet binding budget targets. But any loosening would not apply to Greece, whose bailout is subject to terms set by the commission, the European Central Bank and the IMF. Tsipras said he viewed that deal as null and void. \"The popular verdict clearly renders the bailout deal invalid,\" he said, after two-third of Greeks voted on Sunday for parties rejecting the bailout terms. He called for a moratorium on Greek debt repayments, an investigation of the Greek banks, and the lifting of immunity of Greek MPs to facilitate their prosecution if deemed appropriate. Tsipras's radical coalition was the moral victor of the Greek election, coming second with almost 17% of the vote and beating the mainstream centre-left Pasok into third place. He was asked to try to form a government after an attempt by Antonis Samaras, the centre-right leader, collapsed within hours. No one expects Tsipras to succeed in cobbling together a parliamentary majority either. The talk in Athens was of Greeks having to return to the polls next month. Samaras said Tsipras was asking politicians to sign up to a coalition agreement that would mean \"the destruction of Greece\". Germany's man on the ECB board warned that Greece could be kicked out of the euro if it reneged on the bailout conditions. In an interview to be published on Wednesday, J\u00f6rg Asmussen said: \"It must be clear to Greece that there is no alternative to the agreed restructuring programme if it wants to remain a eurozone member.\" With the turmoil raising fundamental questions about the country's prospects of surviving in the euro, global markets fell sharply. The Athens stock market lost 3.6% to close at its lowest level for almost 20 years. All gains made this year on the FTSE 100 were wiped out as the leading UK index fell 100.51 points to 5554.55, a 1.78% decline. More than \u00a326bn was wiped off the value of Britain's top companieson Tuesday, according to FTSE Group. Germany's Dax lost 1.95%, France's Cac fell 2.8%, while Spain's Ibex dropped 0.8% and Italy's FTSE MIB closed 2.37% lower. The contagion spread to the US, where the Dow Jones Industrial Average was around 159 points, or 1.2%, lower by the time the London market closed. Joshua Raymond, chief market strategist at City Index, said: \"Tthe violent swings we have seen in European equity markets over the past few days are concerning as they show indecision by investors, who are unsure of how to position themselves in the midst of the political uncertainty in Greece.\" Investors were also unnerved by talk of Spain having to rescue its third biggest bank, Bankia, because of toxic property loans. The Spanish prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, is said to have been reluctant to agree to the special EU summit in a fortnight because he feared it would end up being billed as a Spanish crisis meeting. Germany's Angela Merkel was also said to be less than keen on the summit.",

      "bodyText": "Anger over executive pay has escalated, claiming the scalp of the boss of Britain's biggest insurance company, Aviva, and inspiring a shareholder revolt at the bookmaker William Hill. In what is seen as the latest manifestation of a \"shareholder spring\" \u2013 named after the Middle East uprisings last year \u2013 Andrew Moss, chief executive of Aviva, resigned with a \u00a31.7m payoff. He finally quit after investors voted down the insurer's pay policies five days ago in protest at his pay and performance. Ralph Topping, the chief executive of William Hill, was also under pressure after nearly half its shareholders \u2013 49.9% \u2013 voted against its executive pay deals. The vote, which focused on the \u00a31.2m retention package for Topping, was so close that some shareholders are considering asking for a recount. \"It's a photo finish and should go to a steward's enquiry,\" said Sarah Wilson, chief executive of the shareholder advisory body Manifest. The day of drama in the City came amid the biggest wave of shareholder activism since Labour first introduced the \"say on pay\" for shareholders a decade ago. The business secretary, Vince Cable, intends to keep up the pressure on investors by meeting a group of the powerful institutional shareholders in the City. Hours later, the government will use the Queen's speech to set out its intention to hand investors more powers to clamp down on boardroom excess. In recent weeks, David Brennan, chief executive of AstraZeneca, and Sly Bailey, chief executive of Trinity Mirror, have both stepped aside, while protests have been registered at a series of companies including Barclays, the mining firm Xstrata, and the Mr Kipling owner Premier Foods. More protests are expected in the coming days as major companies \u2013 such as the British Gas owner Centrica, household products company Unilever and advertising group WPP \u2013 all hold annual meetings where investors must be allowed to vote on pay deals. Cable, credited for encouraging the wave of shareholder activism through his consultation on executive pay, is likely to introduce a mandatory vote on future pay policies. It is not yet clear whether he thinks that the hurdle for a vote to pass should be raised from 50% to 75%. The current vote, introduced a decade ago, is advisory and can be ignored by companies \u2013 as appears to be case at William Hill, where the chairman, Gareth Davis, brushed aside the protest vote. As well as Cable's pressure on shareholders, the government's austerity measures are galvanising the attitudes of pension fund trustees in how they ask the big City managers to vote at annual meetings. \"It's a perfect alignment of the planets,\" said Wilson. \"Vince Cable's consultation on pay has focused shareholders' minds and there is increasing pressure from the end consumer about underperformance of companies.\" Sacha Sadan, director of corporate governance at Legal &amp; General Investment Management, which controls billions of pounds in investments, said: \"We want remuneration policies to align executive pay to performance.\" L&amp;G, which voted against 125 pay reports last year, is now getting pressure from its clients \u2013 big pension funds, for instance \u2013 about how it votes. Sadan added: \"It's a triangulation of austerity, of government \u2013 because the electorate are focusing on this \u2013 and we've had our clients asking us about it. Everyone in companies are getting zero or inflationary pay rises and it should be the same for executives who have to deal with morale in their companies as well.\" But even before the annual general meeting season ends \u2013 it typically runs from April to June \u2013 there are concerns about keeping up the momentum and securing changes from companies. Some, such as Barclays and Aviva, made tweaks to pay deals before enduring pay protests. Barclays, for instance, put new conditions on a bonus for its chief executive, Bob Diamond, who took home \u00a317m in 2011, while his counterpart at Aviva was forced to hand back a \u00a346,000 pay rise that would have taken his salary above \u00a31m. Guy Jubb, the global head of governance and stewardship at Standard Life Investments, said: \"If there is any dividend from this 'spring', it is the clear reminder to remuneration committees of the impact of not communicating effectively with shareholders.\" Louise Rouse, director of engagement at FairPensions, which campaigns for voting at annual meetings, said: \"Both political and public anger can pass. It is very important that this doesn't become a shareholders spring, that is that it isn't restricted to one season,\" Rouse said.",

      "bodyText": "Last Thursday Andrew Moss secured 90% approval for his re-election as a director of Aviva. By Monday night, he was out of a job because he recognised that shareholders' confidence in him had collapsed. Confused? Welcome to a new chapter in the \"shareholder spring\" \u2013 one where shareholders overwhelmingly vote to retain a chief executive but then mutter that that's not what they meant. In truth, there was fault on both sides at Aviva. For its part, the institutional shareholding class retains a cowardly streak. It can't bring itself to dispatch a sluggish chief executive by the no-nonsense method of voting him off the board; it prefers the roundabout method of disapproving of the whole board's pay (a 54% thumbs-down in Aviva's case) and inviting a resignation. M&amp;G, the fund management division of the Prudential, at least had the decency to register an active abstention against Moss and his chairman, Lord Sharman \u2013 but it was an exception. Aviva's board, though, should not have let matters run to a shambolic finale. The non-executives, led by outgoing chairman Sharman, were deaf to the investors' complaints over many, many months. They should get out more. At least David Brennan at AstraZeneca and Sly Bailey at Trinity Mirror worked out that it was best to go quietly before the annual meeting. The chief charge against Moss was dithering. Strategic rethinks came and went, but nothing seemed to change, or least not at speed. Was Aviva committed to exiting the US? It was hard to tell. The latest annual report was covered in whitewash. There was much crowing about progress at the operational level but little mention of weak bottom-line profits and a share price stuck at just two-thirds of book value. Moss, like his non-executive colleagues, seemed not to understand until last weekend that confidence in him was shattered. The arrival of John McFarlane to replace Sharman seems to have concentrated minds. Does the \"shareholder spring\" mark a permanent change in the weather? Maybe it does. Institutions have been badgered by the trustees of pension funds to up their game. Fearing for their mandates, many have decided that activism is a safer course. It's long overdue: as has been pointed many times, the FTSE 100 index sits at levels seen 15 years ago but boardroom pay most certainly does not. Some will conclude that business secretary Vince Cable should now calm down and forget his notion of giving shareholders a forward-looking, binding vote on pay. Shareholders, it is argued, are proving they can fight their own battles. That argument is a distraction. Look at bookmaker William Hill, where chief executive Ralph Topping was awarded a \u00a31.2m retention bonus. By only the shortest of short heads, shareholders supported the pay report. Would the result have been different if Topping's bonus had been put to them in advance? It's impossible to know \u2013 but at least the matter would have been settled definitively. A split vote on a non-binding resolution leaves both sides claiming moral victory \u2013 and chairman Gareth Davis's comment that he has no regrets will annoy the 49.9%. A binding vote on pay would also oblige institutional investors to be more straightforward in cases like Aviva's, where the real debate is over leadership and strategy. Deliberately mixing separate issues is a strange way to run a rebellion. The future lies in votes that do what they say on the tin.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Former RSA boss Andy Haste and Aviva's finance chief Pat Regan have emerged as frontrunners to replace Aviva boss Andrew Moss, the latest chief executive to be forced out following a shareholder revolt. Moss \u2013 who presided over a 60% decline in the insurers's share price during his time in the top job at Aviva \u2013 will leave the insurer with a \u00a31.75m payoff. His departure follows that of Trinity Mirror's Sly Bailey and AstraZeneca's David Brennan, who also stepped down after shareholders decided their performance was not good enough. Haste, who is credited with turning around rival insurer RSA after its asbestos claims crisis in 2002, is a strong candidate to replace Moss at Aviva, as is Regan, who is regarded as the top internal candidate. Another possible contender is Trevor Matthews, 60, the former Friends Life boss who joined Aviva last year as its UK head. Panmure Gordon analyst Barrie Cornes said: \"The obvious popular choice would be an external appointment and it would probably be Andy Haste. But the obvious candidate doesn't always get the job.\" He pointed to Harry Redknapp's failure to get the England manager's post. Haste has not taken another job since he quit RSA in August, a year after the failure of his bold stab at buying Aviva's UK general insurance business for \u00a35bn. In the latest example of the \"shareholder spring\" that has grown in strength through the current AGM season, Aviva handed its incoming chairman, John McFarlane, day-to-day control of the business until a successor for Moss is found. Aviva hinted that it would take some months, although it is under pressure to find a new chief quickly as Moss's departure leaves the company vulnerable to a takeover or breakup. McFarlane will meet major shareholders in coming days and conduct a review of the business, which is heavily exposed to the eurozone debt crisis. Some are unhappy at Aviva's failure to recover from the financial crisis as well as UK rivals Prudential and Legal &amp; General. Investec analyst Kevin Ryan said Moss had \"tinkered\" with the company's strategy, confusing investors. There have been several U-turns, although Aviva's 2010 decision to focus on 12 core markets rather than 30 has been welcomed in the City. Regan, 46, is the only executive who remains of the existing management from recent years. Aviva's highly regarded UK head Mark Hodges left last June after 20 years to run Towergate Insurance and prepare it for a flotation. Aviva's equally respected European chief Igal Mayer was ousted last month after 23 years with the insurer, making way for Matthews, who was elevated to executive director of developed markets. Investors had become frustrated with the tenure of Moss and he faced an acrimonious annual meeting last Thursday when 60% of shareholders failed to endorse the insurer's pay policies, including Moss's package, worth up to \u00a35m, and a \u00a32.2m golden hello for Matthews. \"Andrew has been unpopular with many shareholders who feel he has at times seemed out of touch with the issues that they thought were facing the group,\" said Oriel Securities analyst Marcus Barnard. Despite the big drop in the share price since he took the helm in July 2007, Moss will get his \u00a3960,000 basic salary for this year; \u00a3300,000 in lieu of bonus; \u00a3209,000 under a pension plan; \u00a345,000 in legal fees and 75% of the 2009 bonus that was deferred into shares, worth \u00a3240,000 at Tuesday's share price. The remuneration committee has prevented share schemes worth up to \u00a32.4m from paying out. Aviva's outgoing chairman, Lord Sharman, said Moss had approached him with the decision to leave as \"he felt it was in the best interests of the company that he step aside to make way for new leadership\". Moss called his chairman on Monday from the holiday he had departed for shortly after Thursday's tumultuous annual meeting. Aviva shares closed up 0.6p at 302.9p after rising 3% earlier in the day. Moss would have faced further questions about his stewardship at an Aviva strategy day on 24 May. That investor day has been postponed. At the annual meeting, some 10% of investors had failed to back the re-election of Moss to the board. M&amp;G, the investment arm of Prudential which holds just under 3% of the stock, is thought to be among the investors to have abstained on Moss and Sharman. McFarlane, who briefly sat on the board of Royal Bank of Scotland and is best known for running ANZ in Australia, said: \"My first priorities are to regain the respect of our shareholders by eliminating the discount in our share price and to find internally or externally the very best leader to be our future chief executive.\"",

Aviva's equally respected <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/apr/19/aviva-regional-management-restructuring\" title=\"\">European chief Igal Mayer was ousted</a> last month after 23 years with the insurer, making way for Matthews, who was elevated to executive director of developed markets.</p> <p>Investors had become frustrated with the tenure of Moss and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/may/03/aviva-shareholder-rebellion-executive-pay\" title=\"\">he faced an acrimonious annual meeting last Thursday</a> when 60% of shareholders failed to endorse the insurer's pay policies, including Moss's package, worth up to \u00a35m, and a \u00a32.2m golden hello for Matthews.</p> <p>\"Andrew has been unpopular with many shareholders who feel he has at times seemed out of touch with the issues that they thought were facing the group,\" said Oriel Securities analyst Marcus Barnard.</p> <p>Despite the big drop in the share price since he took the helm in July 2007, Moss will get his \u00a3960,000 basic salary for this year; \u00a3300,000 in lieu of bonus; \u00a3209,000 under a pension plan; \u00a345,000 in legal fees and 75% of the 2009 bonus that was deferred into shares, worth \u00a3240,000 at Tuesday's share price. The remuneration committee has prevented share schemes worth up to \u00a32.4m from paying out.</p> <p>Aviva's outgoing chairman, Lord Sharman, said Moss had approached him with the decision to leave as \"he felt it was in the best interests of the company that he step aside to make way for new leadership\". Moss called his chairman on Monday from the holiday he had departed for shortly after Thursday's tumultuous annual meeting. Aviva shares closed up 0.6p at 302.9p after rising 3% earlier in the day.</p> <p>Moss would have faced further questions about his stewardship at an Aviva strategy day on 24 May. That investor day has been postponed.</p> <p>At the annual meeting, some 10% of investors had failed to back the re-election of Moss to the board. M&amp;G, the investment arm of Prudential which holds just under 3% of the stock, is thought to be among the investors to have abstained on Moss and Sharman.</p> <p>McFarlane, who briefly sat on the board of Royal Bank of Scotland and is best known for running ANZ in Australia, said: \"My first priorities are to regain the respect of our shareholders by eliminating the discount in our share price and to find internally or externally the very best leader to be our future chief executive.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "With more than half of William Hill's shareholders refusing to support the company's \u00a31.2m retention bonus to its chief executive, you would expect a lively AGM. But the scene in the 250-seater conference centre on an unassuming cobbled mews in central London was a far more serene affair. While some large institutional investors may have followed the advice of corporate governance advisers ISS in voting against the remuneration package, those in the room were far more supportive. Chairman Gareth Davis and chief executive Ralph Topping received a warm round of applause from the assembled shareholders as they listed the bookmakers' various achievements. There were few mutterings when Topping's controversial retention bonus \u2013 which will keep him at the bookmakers until the end of 2013 \u2013 was mentioned. When Davis asked the assembled shareholders \u2013 one of whom informed the hall he had travelled all the way from Yeovil to attend \u2013 if they supported the resolution, around 80% waved their voting cards in favour. But during the usual question-and-answer session, some dissent emerged over the \u00a31.2m shares and cash deal. Shareholder Anthony Lee said: \"At last year's AGM the chief executive said he has never been more excited with the people he is working with and that he loved the business. \"That was all very encouraging, but I was worried that between four and five weeks later Mr Topping loved the business so much he had to be offered a whacking incentive to stay with the business and it seemed very odd. \"I wonder now, what happened in those four or five weeks after attending the AGM?\" He added: \"There is a general feeling across industries that chief executives are drinking in a last chance saloon.

The closeness of the vote did leave some questioning whether a show of hands was the best way to determine the outcome. Chairman Gareth Davis pointed out the proxy vote was 50.1% in favour of the remuneration package, with 49.9% against, before the vote in the room took place.

Tour operators traditionally make a loss in the first half of the year, before catching up over the summer \u2013 TUI made a \u00a3144m profit before tax in 2011. Its chief executive, Peter Long, described the group's performance as \"credible\". Revenues were up 5% to \u00a35.45bn in the six months to 31 March, with UK trading flat compared with a market which Long estimated was down around 10%.

Summer trading was brighter, with total sales up 3% in the UK compared with last year, although total customer numbers were down 6%. TUI has sold 55% of its UK programme, and trading outperformed the market.

Long reiterated guidance for the full year, and increased the interim dividend 3% to 3.4p, but added: \"Given the challenging economic environment, we remain cautious.\" Net debt widened slightly from \u00a31.182bn to \u00a31.184bn.",

      "bodyText": "Stuart Gulliver, chief executive of HBSC, gave his backing to the government's austerity measures on Tuesday even as France's new Socialist president pledged to step back from such tough budget regimes. The boss of Britain's biggest bank also admitted that it was impossible to know if Greece would leave the eurozone after the weekend elections made it difficult for a government to be formed in Athens. As the bank reported a slide in pre-tax profits to $4.3bn (\u00a32.7bn) from $4.9bn, Gulliver said that the markets were rewarding the coalition's austerity policies by keeping interest rates low and sterling strong. \"The UK should continue with its austerity policies, as tough as it is,\" he said. The bank has a large business in France after buying CCF in 2000. After the French president-elect, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, pledged to step back from austerity in an effort to bolster growth in France, Gulliver said \"it remains to be seen what the departure from austerity might be.\" Hollande's election on Sunday had been expected, Gulliver said, pointing to the muted market reaction on Monday when shares traded in France ended the day higher. But with on-going political uncertainty in Greece, where a messy election result has left the parties unable to form a government, there is increasing speculation that the debt-laden country will leave the eurozone. Economists at Citigroup have pushed the chances of a Greek exit up from 50% to 75%. Gulliver's verdict was that the eurozone as a whole would survive. \"I don't think the eurozone will break up \u2013 but it's impossible to say whether or not Greece will stay in,\" he said. The Financial Services Authority has already told banks to have contingency plans for a eurozone member leaving, Gulliver said. The bank has cut 14,000 jobs since this time last year as part of Gulliver's strategy to improve the return on equity \u2013 a measure closely watched by shareholders \u2013 from 6.4% to 12% by the end of 2013. Some 30,000 jobs \u2013 almost one-in-10 \u2013 will have been lost by the time the three-year programme is completed and the bank has now achieved $2bn in annual savings through the programme, which has also involved pulling out of 30 business. In the UK, the bank has been forced to increase its provision for claims against payment protection insurance \u2013 as Lloyds banking group, Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland have already done \u2013 because of a rise in claims. The total provision is now \u00a3750m after taking a \u00a3290m in the first quarter and Gulliver said there was administrative hassle in dealing with claims management companies. He described the ability of these companies to make claims against banks even for customers who did not have PPI polices as a \"zero-cost option\" and suggested the claims management companies should be forced to cover some of the cost of spurious claims. Gulliver, who is holding a strategy day next week, said that he was making good progress in implementing our strategy. The bank reported a loss in first quarter of $997m compared with a profit of $652m a year ago but this was largely the result of a change in the value of the bank's own debt. If the $2.6bn change in the value of the bank's debt is excluded from results, the group profits were up 25% at $6.8bn.",
