      "bodyText": "Marks &amp; Spencer is to take on John Lewis with a heart-warming Christmas ad starring Janet McTeer as a glamorous \u201cMrs Claus\u201d with a James Bond-style alter ego. With retailers\u2019 festive commercials an annual battle for hearts and minds, the high street chain has taken a leaf out its rival\u2019s book with a story about six-year-old Jake, who after a year of squabbling with his sister Anna, wants to make up by giving her a present she loves. \u201cMrs Claus represents a lot of M&amp;S\u2019s values: she\u2019s ageless and approachable, with wit and great style,\u201d said Patrick Bousquet-Chavanne, M&amp;S\u2019s executive director of customer, marketing and M&amp;S.com. \u201cShe epitomises the huge efforts our customers put in to making the festive season special.\u201d The retailer hopes the feelgood ad will pull in shoppers this Christmas after last year\u2019s disappointing sales performance. Bousquet-Chavanne said 2015\u2019s more product-focused campaign had failed to capture consumers\u2019 imagination and it had polled the opinions of thousands of customers to find out what they really wanted to see. Asked if the ad\u2019s tone was also a response to John Lewis\u2019s successful use of ads that tell stories in an attempt to win hearts, Bousquet-Chavanne said: \u201cNobody has a monopoly on emotion and we do compete on the high street [with John Lewis]. We think it is very M&amp;S.\u201d The cinematic ad, filmed in Iceland with sweeping shots of glaciers and dramatic ice cliffs, is directed by Oscar-winning director Tom Hooper. Its shows Mrs Claus race to Jake\u2019s aid, piloting a skidoo and a helicopter from Lapland \u2013 all while wearing a red Per Una bodycon dress and matching wool coat \u2013 to deliver a pair of red sparkly trainers to his London home. Bousquet-Chavanne declined to say how much was spent on the making of the ad but that the figure was less than for Christmas 2015. He added that its weekly barometer of shopper confidence showed positive sentiment among its customer base as the peak trading season gets under way. \u201cWe feel good that there will be growth in this retail season,\u201d he said. \u201cThe customer is in the right place.\u201d This will be the first Christmas with Steve Rowe, who took over as M&amp;S chief executive six months ago, at the helm. This week he announced plans to slash the amount of shopfloor space devoted to M&amp;S\u2019s clothing ranges and to close 30 UK stores. The ad will make its debut on Friday on Channel 4 at 9pm during Gogglebox. It will be shown again during The X Factor on Saturday, enabling the retailer to reach a combined audience of 7.5 million people. But with social media increasingly important, Mrs Claus also has her own emoji and hashtag, #AskMrsClaus.",

      "bodyText": "After a momentous week, Wall Street seems to have simply run out of energy. The Dow Jones index is virtually flat now, up 0.02%, while the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq are slightly in the red. Traders are taking a breather, and watching political events unfold. And there\u2019s plenty happening -- the latest news is that vice-president in waiting Mike Pence has just been appointed to lead the Trump transition team, instead of Chris Christie. Our US politics liveblog has all the details: So I\u2019m going to wrap up for the week now. Here\u2019s Katie Allen\u2019s news story on today\u2019s financial developments. Goodnight! GW JP Morgan analysts are warning tonight that Donald Trump could destabilise the US economy if he slaps tariffs on new imports from abroad: Hopefully they\u2019ve sent a copy to their boss, CEO Jamie Dimon -- rumoured to be in the running to become the next Treasury secretary. One other interesting development tonight....It\u2019s emerged that three employees at major banks have recently been arrested by Britain\u2019s National Crime Agency as part of a UK insider trading investigation. The arrests are linked to the Panama Papers, and were made in the last few months but only reported today. More here: As currency traders head home, or to the nearest City winebar, they can reflect on the pound\u2019s unexpected strength this week. As this chart shows, sterling has gained more than 3% against the single currency this week, from \u20ac1.12 to around \u20ac1.16. There\u2019s an argument that people are hoping that Brexit will be easier with Trump in the White House. But I think the pound is really benefitting from worries about Europe. Italy\u2019s constitutional referendum next month, or the French and German elections in 2017, could all undermine the eurozone. Conner Campbell of SpreadEx says: Fears of the rising political right in the Eurozone and potential US instability once Trump takes over are crucially helping to put Brexit on the back-burner for the time being. The US government bond market is closed today for Veterans Day. And bond traders should enjoy the rest while they can - Treasuries will surely be volatile next week too, as the clock ticks towards Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration. Capital Economics\u2019 Julian Jessop predicts further losses, as the markets try to price in the prospect of a new infrastructure spending programme financed by debt. He writes: The election results mean that there may now be a big fiscal expansion, which adds to the downside risks for bonds for at least two reasons. First, it would increase their supply. Second, we think it would mainly boost inflation rather than growth. Jessop also suspects that the Wall Street rally will fizzle out, as investors focus their minds on possible trade wars under President Trump. For a start, the strong performance of some sectors (such as industrials, basic materials and energy) has reflected hopes for a big splurge on infrastructure spending, which we think is unlikely \u2013 most of the fiscal stimulus is likely to take the form of tax cuts. Stock markets do not tend to fare well when inflation is rising either. And investors may start to worry again soon about the implications for growth of Trump\u2019s other proposals, such as trade tariffs. There\u2019s no respite for the Mexican economy, I\u2019m afraid. Its government bonds are weakening again, driving up yields, and the peso is hitting fresh lows: The Trump Jump we saw in the immediate aftermath of this week\u2019s presidential election has hit a hump. London\u2019s FTSE 100 has suffered another day of chunky losses, closing down 97 points, or almost 1.5%. The stronger pound is partly to blame; sterling is up 0.5% right not over $1.26. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, explains that Brexit anxiety has faded this week. If FTSE bulls were emboldened by Wednesday\u2019s incredible fightback to regain the 7000 mark, they will be feeling somewhat weary today, as the UK benchmark suffered substantial losses amid a comprehensive recovery for sterling. The pound was expected to rise on last week\u2019s realisation that Article 50 is now in the hands of Brexit-sceptic MPs, and with the US election now out of the way, we are seeing that pound rebound take shape. Much like a weakening euro was perceived to be good for UK stocks, today\u2019s pound rally is doing little to help the FTSE, which has suffered more than most. Most other European stock markets also closed in the red, and Wall Street is still down As flagged up earlier, analysts believe Europe will suffer if Trump does manage to boost US growth through tax cuts and a spending boost. Jasper Lawler of CMC Markets says: The new Donald Trump vision for America is drawing the attention of international capital. This renewed belief in a better environment for corporate America is at the expense of Europe and especially emerging markets. The City is also concerned by the heavy losses in the bond market this week, which wiped out around $1trn. That, funnily enough, is also how much has been added to the US equities market this week, according to Bloomberg. Billionaire investor Warren Buffett says income inequality helped to drive Donald Trump to the White House. In an interview with CNN, Buffett, who has called for tax reform in the past, says ordinary Americans feel that wealth distribution is unfair: The Forbes 400 [list of wealthiest Americans] had $93bn dollars in 1982, and they\u2019ve got 2.4 trillion dollars today. That\u2019s 25 times as much. If you\u2019ve been working 40 hours a week, maybe holding a second job and you work with the Little League [junior baseball] and you\u2019ve been a good parent, and you\u2019re really struggling. Then you think, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with this picture?\u201d, and you want to change the picture. Buffett, worth an estimated $70bn, also criticises Trump\u2019s criticism of free trade, saying protectionism would harm the US economy. But while Buffett isn\u2019t a fan of Trump, he\u2019s now calling on Americans to back the president-elect. Unity, he says, is now crucial, after a particularly negative and personal campaign: It\u2019s every important that the American people coalesce behind a president. That doesn\u2019t mean they can\u2019t criticise, or disagree with what he\u2019s doing. But we need a country unified by a president. Buffett also warns that Trump can\u2019t deliver on all his pledges, such as doubling economic growth. \u201cNobody can grow the economy 4% in real terms over time...The math is too extraordinary.\u201d The full interview is online here. Speaking of Europe... Trade commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom suggested today that talks with the US about the controversial TTIP agreement will probably be \u2018frozen\u2019 for a while now. Malmstrom told reporters in Brussels that: \u201cThere will be a natural pause, of course, while we wait for the next administration; then, for quite some time TTIP will probably be in the freezer. Then what happens when it\u2019s defrosted, I think we will need to wait and see.\u201d This week can\u2019t end enough for City traders, who are sending shares steadily lower in London. The FTSE 100 is now down 116 points, or -1.7%, at 6712. Precious metals firms are leading the rout, along with oil companies and major exporters. Germany is defying the global market selloff today, with its DAX index slightly higher. That\u2019s partly thanks to Deutsche Bank, whose shares have surged over 4% today. There\u2019s speculation that the German lender has a better chance of negotiating a lower penalty with the US Department of Justice, over misconduct before the financial crisis. Deutsche should also benefit from a higher inflation environment; record low interest rates have hurt its profitability. Its share plunged through \u20ac10 at the end of September, on fears over its financial health. They\u2019re now worth \u20ac14.7 Europe\u2019s biggest threat from the Trump presidency is a new trade war that scuppers exports and growth, says Kallum Pickering of Germany\u2019s Berenberg bank. He writes: Europe earns almost 20% of its GDP from exports, that is 50% more than the US [see chart below]. European producers would feel the pinch of a more inward-looking and less trade-oriented US. A US shift towards isolationism over the next four years that might then be mirrored by other countries is the major economic risk for Europe following the Trump victory. If Trump does what he said in the campaign, namely brand China as a currency manipulator and place a 45% punitive tariff on Chinese imports, he could trigger a trade war. While Congress would block many of his more extreme policy proposals, such a move would badly exacerbate a tilt in the Western world against globalisation. Trade oriented economies like those of Europe would lose even more from that than the US. After several days of gains, the US stock market appears to be readjusting to the new reality. Some of the shares that have done best since Donald Trump won the election are leading the fallers. That includes drugs firms Pfizer (-2%) and Merck (-1%), who had posted gains after the prospect of a price-gouging clampdown faded with Hillary Clinton\u2019s victory chances. Exxon Mobile is down 1.8% -- it had been another Trump gainer, as the next president is relaxed about the dangers of climate change. And Caterpillar had lost 0.6%; having been driven up by the prospect of new orders for its digging machines to help build new American highways, airports and schools. Just in: American consumer confidence has jumped this month, beating expectations. The University of Michigan consumer sentiment index has just come in at 91.6, up from 87.2 in October. However... the numbers were collected before the US election results were known. So investors might not read too much into it.... The copper price is in retreat! Having been up almost 10% today, it\u2019s now shed those gains since Wall Street opened. Wall Street is open, for the final trading session of a tumultuous week. And shares are dipping in early trading, pulling the three main indices into the red: Wall Street is about to open, following a minute\u2019s silence for Veterans Day (Europeans have already marked Armistice Day). So let\u2019s catch up quickly: Fears of a new wave of protectionism and a surge of inflation are causing fresh turbulence in the financial markets today, as Donald Trump\u2019s election victory continues to grip investors. The British pound has romped to its highest levels since the \u2018flash crash\u2019 of early October. It\u2019s currently trading 0.5% higher at $1.261 against the US dollar, and \u20ac1.157 against the euro. Analysts say sterling is benefitting from hopes that Britain and the US could work closely together, in a post-Brexit world. However, we still don\u2019t have a clue, frankly, about how president Trump will approach international relations. The stronger pound has hit London shares, sending the FTSE 100 down 86 points, or 1.26%, to 6741. Earlier, emerging markets were hit by wild gyrations, with many currencies sliding against the US dollar. Trump\u2019s victory fuelled fears of weaker global trade and a flow of capital out of the developing world and back into American assets. Indonesia\u2019s rupiah tumbled by 3%, forcing officials to intervene to prop the currency up. And Mexico\u2019s peso has fallen to a new record low. Commodity markets have also seen drama, with the copper price shooting up. Copper is seen as a bellwether of US economic growth, and the speed of its recent gains have shocked traders. And it\u2019s turning into a very bad week for bond prices. Traders arre ditch sovereign debt in anticipation that inflation will push up. A staggering $1 trillion dollars has been knocked off the market since Monday (leaving the global market worth around $45trn). This is pushing government borrowing costs up, especially for Italy - which might be the next country hit by political instability. The strengthening pound highlights concerns that relations between Europe and America will deteriorate, says Ranko Berich, head of market analysis at Monex Europe. \u201cSterling is trading up, possibly because the risk of Brexit derailing Britain\u2019s trading relationships has now been put within a context of President Trump potentially aiming to renegotiate NAFTA. Equally plausible is the risk of Italy exiting the European Union as a result of Matteo Renzi failing to pass constitutional reforms and losing power to the Eurosceptic Five Star Movement. There\u2019s also the possibility that British interest rates will rise sooner than expected: \u201cThe increase in global inflation expectations also puts the Bank of England under scrutiny as one of the first central banks to potentially respond to an increase in inflation by withdrawing accommodation.\u201d The futures market is suggesting that the US stock market will fall, when trading begins in around 80 minutes. The Dow is expected to dip by 0.2%, or 38 points, having hit a record high last night. The tech-focused Nasdaq is heading for further losses, down 0.8%. Britain is on the brink of a \u2018hard Brexit\u2019 that will further diminish its standing in the world as it loses free access to Europe\u2019s single market. So says Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s in a new, rather depressing, assessment of the UK. In it, S&amp;P\u2019s Moritz Kraemer, says there is a \u2018gulf\u2019 between Britain and fellow EU members, and big divisions at home: \u201cFar from healing festering wounds, as was then Prime Minister David Cameron\u2019s intention, the referendum has deepened and laid bare the schisms in British society. \u201cMost of the economic impact will hit Britain itself. The second-round effect on the world economy is likely to be more limited, as the UK economy accounts for a small and shrinking share of global GDP.\u201d More here: Julian Jessop of Capital Economics also thinks investors are being too blas\u00e9 about the president elect: Mexico\u2019s financial markets are suffering another bad day, as fears over future trade relations with America keep rising. Mexican government bond prices have hit their lowest levels since February, as the peso keeps sliding to record lows (now at 21.2 peso to the $1). Nicholas Hyett, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, highlights some significant market moves in London: Asset managers Aberdeen and Ashmore are down 5.3% and 6.7% respectively on worries that a spending splurge under Trump could cause the Fed to hike interest rates to fend off inflation. That has hit emerging market bonds, to which both have exposure, hard this morning. The ongoing rally in sterling is boosting the UK\u2019s retailers, with Next, which has previously warned that the lower pound could result in a 5% increase in prices at its stores, leading the way, up 3.4%. Two moves really stand out, on a day of general market volatility: In case there was any doubt about who\u2019s expected to benefit from a Trump presidency... Yup, that\u2019s banks, industrial firms, healthcare providers and traditional energy all UP, with technology and consumer goods firms DOWN. The sharp selloff in emerging market currencies earlier today (details here) appears to have sent a shiver through European markets. After seeing the Dow hit a record high last night, investors are reassessing the situation... so we could see falling shares on Wall Street too. FXTM research analyst Lukman Otunuga says: Markets awoke with a change of heart during early trading on Friday with emerging market stocks descending into the abyss as fears heightened over higher US interest rates under new US President Donald Trump. Copper is continuing to defy the wider losses, driven by hopes of a new US infrastructure-spending plan. The copper price has jumped another 5% today towards $5,900 per tonne, the highest since June 2015. City investors should certainly keep an eye on the protests taking place in major US cities since the election, as they ponder how events will play out. The scale of the anger about Donald Trump\u2019s victory may shake any breezy complacency that the next president can simply unite the country, push some tax cuts through Congress, and kick off a Keynesian-style rebuilding project. Naeem Aslam of Think Markets says: The social unrest over in the US represents a risk for markets which traders should not ignore. This is very important and President Trump needs to address this issue as he has taken custody of a divided country. Yes, the equity market has achieved another record high over in the US, however, if these protests picked up more steam, we could have some serious problems which could be followed by a sharp sell-off for the market. Investors could lose the confidence and that might result in a move from risk on trade to risk off trade. Aslam also reckons that Trump\u2019s victory could help Britain as it exits from the EU: As for the UK, Theresa May, is going to take advantage of the situation as Donald Trump was a big supporter of Brexit. She has been invited to the US, the trade discussion will be on the forefront. The odds are higher that Donald trump will be a lot more relaxed in relation to striking some exclusive deals with the UK. If Theresa May becomes successful in carving some special deals with the US, it will make the matter a lot easier in achieving a similar goal with other countries like China and India All Europe\u2019s stock markets have all slid into the red, following the heavy losses in some emerging markets overnight. Some traders are anticipating that the European economy may also be buffeted by events in America. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets says: The new Donald Trump vision for America is drawing the attention of international capital. This renewed belief in a better environment for corporate America is at the expense of Europe and especially emerging markets. The strengthening pound is a punch in the stomach for the British stock market. The FTSE 100 has now shed 75 points, or -1.1%, at 6752, dragged down by international firms who earn in dollars. Shire Pharmaceuticals and Rolls Royce, the engine maker, are both down over 3%, while Standard Chartered (-4.7%) continue to suffer from the turmoil in its key Asian emerging markets. And the smaller FTSE 250 is also suffering, down 0.9%. After some short-term gains after the US election, the City is now bogged down with the thorny question of what the next US president will actually do. Chris Beauchamp of IG explains: The initial bounce was driven by a realisation that Trump\u2019s infrastructure stimulus would indeed come to pass, but since then investors have been scrambling to work out all the other implications, and this will take far longer. In this climate of uncertainty, markets such as the FTSE 100 now look expensive for now, especially with a rising pound. Predictions of higher American inflation (and interest rates) have pushed the US dollar up against almost every major currency this week. The pound, though, is a rare winner - perhaps showing that Brexit fears have either eased or simply been temporarily ignored. Norman Lamont, a former British finance minister, claims that European leaders will be spooked by the double-whammy of the Brexit vote and Trump\u2019s election win. He argues that the two events are different -- Brexit is about \u2018free trade\u2019 with the whole world, he insists, while Trump\u2019s view on trade are clearly different. But still: On the whole, the psychological factor is one that will worry the Europeans quite a lot. The pound has now gained one percent, or 1.25 cents, against the US dollar this week -- making it a rare winner from Trump\u2019s victory. The pound is now higher than its levels before October\u2019s \u2018flash crash\u2019. Caxton FX analyst Alexandra Russell-Oliver suggests sterling is benefitting from the prospect of America and Britain remaining close (despite political upheaval in both counties this year). The pound may be receiving additional support as President-elect Trump emphasises that the US and the UK will continue to enjoy a \u201cvery special\u201d relationship. The pound has also gained ground against the euro, up almost one eurocent at \u20ac1.161. That means one euro is now worth 86.1p. Tony Cross, analyst at TopTradr, says fears of European political instability are pushing sterling up. Granted it\u2019s starting from a low base given the beating the currency took, both from the shock Brexit vote and the flash crash just over a month ago, but this is increasingly looking as if it\u2019s been overdone. Critically there\u2019s growing concern that we\u2019ll see a rising tide of nationalism across continental Europe, with French elections in the new year a real cause for concern, pushing EUR/GBP down to below 0.8700 for the first time since late September. Zing! Sterling has just jumped over the $1.26 mark for the first time in five weeks, a gain of 0.5%. It\u2019s moving (slowly) towards the levels seen before prime minister Theresa May pledged to start the Brexit process by March 2017 (when the pound was worth $1.30). Trump\u2019s election success seems to have shunted concerns over Britain\u2019s future onto the back burner - for the moment, anyway: Newsflash: The Mexican peso has hit a new record low, as the turmoil in emerging market currencies continues. The peso has just lurched down to 20.8385 against the US dollar, as traders expect shockwaves from Trump\u2019s election win. In another alarming move, the yield on Italy\u2019s 10-year government bonds have hit their highest level in a year. There are fears that Italy\u2019s prime minister, Matteo Renzi, will lose his referendum on constitutional reform next month, triggering a new bout of political instability. In London, the FTSE 100 has dropped 26 points in early trading, to 6801, adding to yesterday\u2019s 80-odd point decline. So-called \u2018defensive stock\u2019 such as utility companies and tobacco makers are up -- after all, we\u2019ll still need energy and water next year. But Standard Chartered, the bank with plenty of exposure to Asia\u2019s emerging market, have dropped almost 5%. The pound is also pushing higher this morning, now at $1.26, which is dragging down the share price of internationally-focused companies. European markets are a little higher, though, after German financial giant Allianz reassured investors by reporting better-than-expected profits. Emerging market currencies are also being hit by the prospect that US interest rates will be raised next month (making the US dollar more attractive). FXTM vice-president of Market Research, Jameel Ahmad, reckons the Federal Reserve is under strong pressure to deliver a hike in December: While the declines seen in Asian currencies are being linked to the impact of trade throughout the continent if Donald Trump enforces protectionist trade policies, the return of expectations that the Federal Reserve will still raise US interest rates in December is strengthening the Dollar and also pressuring the emerging market currencies. If the Federal Reserve do not raise US interest rates in December as they have been preparing the markets towards for months following such a spectacular rebound in stocks after the victory by Trump, it will raise questions over credibility and concerns that they are worried about Donald Trump taking over office in January. The government bond selloff is continuing this morning, as investors continue to anticipate that Trumponomics will push up inflation. Britain\u2019s 10-year gilt is falling, driving up the yield (interest rate) on the bond to 1.4% for the first time since June, up from 1.34% last night. That\u2019s a chunky move, pushing up the Westminster government\u2019s cost of borrowing. French, German,Spanish and Portuguese bond yields are also falling today, as money pours out of sovereign debt Reminder: yields rise when prices fall, as investors are demanding a higher rate of return for holding the debt. Bloomberg reports that more than $1trn has taken out of the bond market this week alone: It\u2019s been a wild day in the emerging markets, as nervous traders fear a new wave of American protectionism. Currencies stumbled and shares slid amid worries that exports will fall once Donald Trump is in the White House. There is also angst that some of the \u2018hot money\u2019 capital that has flowed to developing countries will soon move back to the US. Indonesia suffered a bad day - the authorities were forced to intervene in the foreign exchange market after the rupiah plunged 3%, its biggest drop in five years. This also sent shockwaves through Indonesia\u2019s stock market -- the Jakarta Composite fell over 3%, on track for its worst day in a year. Among other emerging market currencies, South Korea\u2019s won lost 1.1 per cent, the Taiwanese dollar Indian rupee shed 0.5%, while the Thai baht is down 0.4 per cent. It wasn\u2019t a good time to be a peso, either. The Philippine peso has hit a seven year low, while its Mexican counterpart has fallen back towards record levels due to worries about the Trump\u2019s anti-Mexico stance. More details here: Good morning. Forty eight hours after the US election results flooded in, Donald Trump\u2019s victory over Hillary Clinton continues to reverberate through the financial markets. But there\u2019s also a real sense of fatigue this morning, as traders try to anticipate the next few moves and analysts frantically assess the implications of a Trump presidency and a Republican-dominated White House. Last night, the Dow Jones index hit a new all-time high - a phrase we didn\u2019t anticipate writing when a swathe of key battleground states went Republican red in the early hours of Wednesday morning. Wall Street traders are piling into companies such as Caterpillar, anticipating a new infrastructure programme. Banks are also in demand, as Trump\u2019s transition team signal that they will dismantle the Dodd-Frank regulations. But money continues to flow out of government government bonds at an alarming rate, driven by predictions that the tax cuts and debt-fuelled stimulus plan promised by Trump would drive up inflation. RBC Capital Markets explain why investors think the US economy might get a lift, at least in the short term: Given Trump\u2019s election night speech and the generally feel-good vibe raining down on Trump from within his party, there is reason to be optimistic. Time will tell. But if you were to press us on the economic impact, directionally we are inclined to believe the net result will be positive. Practically speaking it\u2019s difficult to make a call on how the Republican sweep impacts the economic outlooks over the medium term without having a concrete framework of legislative measures in place. But if the conciliatory messaging from the Congressional Republicans and President-elect Trump are any indication, we could be poised for some significant pro-growth initiatives very early on in the administration. We note that corporate tax reform is \u201clow-hanging fruit\u201d and we would add regulatory reform to that list as well (given the rhetoric over the last 24 hours). BUT....Trump\u2019s anti-immigrant, anti free-trade stance is also sending a chill across developing markets - who have benefitted from the increased pace of globalisation in recent years. Jeffrey Halley, a market strategist at Oanda Asia Pacific in Singapore, says big changes are afoot, telling Bloomberg that: \u201cThere\u2019s been a big rotation out of emerging markets into U.S. dollar assets.\u201d \u201cAn emerging market is a market you can\u2019t emerge from in an emergency. It\u2019s one of the best lessons I\u2019ve ever learnt in 30 years in the market. When everybody runs for the door at the same time, the door\u2019s very small.\u201d So 2016 could yet end with a bout of market instability, or worse, as everyone wonders what next year will hold. We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day....",

      "bodyText": "The National Crime Agency has arrested three employees from blue-chip banks as part of a major UK insider trading investigation linked to the Panama Papers. The arrests, which were made in recent months and first reported on Friday, are the latest development in an operation led by City watchdog the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). Its existence was disclosed by ministers this week. After the leak of a cache of data from the Panama based law firm Mossack Fonseca by the Guardian and other media in April, the UK government ordered the creation of a multiagency Panama Papers taskforce with funding of \u00a310m. On Tuesday, the chancellor and the home secretary revealed the taskforce had been working on \u201ca major insider-trading operation\u201d. The investigation began before the publication of the Panama Papers but it has been given new impetus by the release of the biggest-ever leak of confidential tax haven data. New leads are understood to have come from information obtained by the UK taskforce, with ministers saying it had acquired \u201chigh-quality, significant and credible data on offshore activity in Panama\u201d. A spokesman for the National Crime Agency, which tackles serious and organised crime, said: \u201cWe have nothing to add to the written ministerial statement released earlier this week.\u201d The FCA declined to comment. The financial news service Bloomberg reported claimed the operation could be one of the largest UK insider trading inquiries. It said more arrests were planned, and that officers from the NCA were assisting with covert surveillance. Neither those detained, nor their employers, have been named. The Panama Papers taskforce was announced in April, one week after the simultaneous publication of the first leaked files by media outlets in more than 80 countries. It brought together investigators, compliance specialists and analysts from HM Revenue and Customs, the NCA, the Serious Fraud Office and the FCA. This week ministers told parliament that civil and criminal investigations into 22 individuals suspected of tax evasion had been opened. They said the taskforce has identified nine professional enablers of economic crime, all of whom have links with known criminals. Forty-three high-net-worth individuals have had their tax status placed under special review. And officers have uncovered 26 offshore companies holding UK property whose owners have been linked to suspicious financial activity. The German newspaper S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung obtained 11.5m leaked documents from an anonymous whistleblower calling themselves John Doe, and the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists in Washington shared the information with media outlets around the world. The ICIJ has declined to show the leaked documents to any government, saying it is not an arm of law enforcement and its policy is not to turn over such material. UK regulators have been flexing their muscles on insider trading, with a number of high-profile court cases and investigations. Operation Tabernula culminated this year when a jury convicted former Deutsche Bank corporate broker Martyn Dodgson of insider dealing. Dodgson, who advised the government on its stakes in Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group, was sentenced to four and a half years in prison. Last week a former manager at BlackRock, the investment firm, admitted to improperly trading shares and other investment products in the run-up to public announcements. Mark Lyttleton was arrested by City of London police in April 2013 and has pleaded guilty in a case that involved the use of a Panamanian-registered company to carry out trades.",

      "bodyText": "The owner of Britain\u2019s biggest steelworks has boosted the survival chances of the Port Talbot plant by committing to stabilising its ailing UK business. The group executive director of Tata Steel, Koushik Chatterjee, said the company is focused on turning around its UK operations as the company published its financial results. Chatterjee said Tata Steel\u2019s performance had improved significantly over the past year thanks to cost cuts, more efficient use of its plants and the cheap pound. In the most positive comments about the future of the UK business since Tata Steel launched a review of the operations in March, he added: The company will strive to continue to focus on the improvement in the European performance with special focus to make UK structurally sustainable and de-risked to future external volatility.\u201d Tata Steel said the talks with German company ThyssenKrupp about a merger of their European steel operations are continuing, as are negotiations over the future of the British Steel pension scheme with trustees, the Pensions Regulator and the government. But Chatterjee\u2019s comments suggest that Tata Steel is paving the way to keep its UK business \u2013 whether the merger with ThyssenKrupp goes ahead or not \u2013 and try to turn around its performance. The future of Tata Steel UK and its 11,000 workers has been in doubt since its Indian owner announced the review, amid mounting losses and heavy debts. The latest financial result for the European arm of Tata Steel show revenues in the three months to the end of September fell from \u00a31.5bn in the previous quarter to \u00a31.4bn, but underlying profits rose from \u00a390m to \u00a3116m. The fall in the value of the pound has boosted the profitability of the UK business. It has made exports more valuable and imports to Britain from rival steel providers less competitive, although this benefit has been partly offset by an increase in costs because key raw materials such as iron ore and coal are bought in dollars. Tata Steel declined to publish the financial results of the UK arm, which was losing more than \u00a31m a day earlier in the year but is now understood to be performing significantly better. However, Tata Steel sources insisted that the UK business could not rely on a weak pound to be competitive and needed to make significant changes to be sustainable. Ratan Tata, the interim chairman of Tata Group \u2013 Tata Steel\u2019s Indian parent \u2013 aims to make a final decision about whether to keep its UK steel business or sell it off within the next few weeks. The UK business is only likely to be included in the ThyssenKrupp deal if the pension scheme can be restructured. Tata is also in the process of selling its speciality steels business, which is based in the north east of England and employs 2,000 people. The company has shortlisted bidders, who are now conducting due diligence. The British Steel pension scheme remains a major obstacle to the future of Tata Steel UK. It has liabilities of more than \u00a315bn and 130,000 members, making it one of the biggest retirement schemes in the country. Earlier this week, Stephen Kinnock, the Labour MP for Aberavon, which includes the Port Talbot steelworks, said it would be an \u201cabsolute disgrace\u201d if Tata closed the scheme and said the Indian company had \u201cmoral and social responsibilities\u201d.",

More than 2,000 of the airline\u2019s mixed fleet employees working out of Heathrow are to be balloted next week. All new recruits join the mixed fleet, which was set up in 2010 offering markedly inferior pay and conditions to those enjoyed by existing crew. Unite, the union representing the crew, says the average pay including allowances is just \u00a316,000 a year, a figure disputed by BA, which says crew would normally make at least \u00a321,000 a year with bonuses, from a basic salary of \u00a312,000 a year. The union claims the low pay has seen crew sleeping in their cars between shifts and working in different jobs on their days off to make ends meet. A union survey found two in three crew had gone to work while unfit to fly because they could not afford to be off sick. Unite\u2019s regional officer Matt Smith said: \u201cBritish Airways, once the \u2018world\u2019s favourite airline\u2019, is fast becoming the \u2018world\u2019s least liked\u2019, paying poverty wages. It should be to the company\u2019s eternal shame that they, the UK\u2019s national carrier, are making billions while their cabin crew responsible for maintaining a safe environment are working while sick and without adequate rest.\u201d Discontent at pay and conditions has been brewing for several years among lower-paid recruits, who considered a strike in 2014. Walsh, chief executive of BA\u2019s parent company IAG, earned \u00a36.5m in 2015, while the company is forecasting annual profits of \u20ac2.5bn (\u00a32.3bn). A British Airways spokeswoman said: \u201cOur pay proposal for our mixed fleet cabin crew is fair, reasonable and consistent with that already accepted by other British Airways colleagues. It reflects typical pay awards given by other companies in the UK and will ensure their reward levels remain in line with cabin crew at our airline competitors. We remain open and flexible to discuss this further with our colleagues and the union.\u201d She said that the pay offer would see basic pay and hourly duty rates increase by a minimum of 7%. One of Britain\u2019s most prolonged and bitter strikes in recent years took place at BA, when cabin crew walked out for 22 days between 2010 and 2011, costing the airline about \u00a3150m. Earlier this year, BA crew voted for industrial action short of a strike in protest at a new performance review system.",

      "bodyText": "Deliveroo\u2019s top director nearly doubled his pay last year before the company trimmed pay for thousands of delivery riders. The London-based company\u2019s highest-paid director, thought to be founder William Shu, was paid a salary of \u00a3102,135 in the year to December 2015 compared with \u00a353,333 in the previous year according to accounts filed at Companies House on Friday. Shu has a large stake in the business which, after a fund raising in August, now has a value approaching $1bn. The jump in Shu\u2019s pay comes despite a massive widening of losses at Deliveroo to \u00a318.1m, up from \u00a31.4m a year before as the group invested in expansion in Ireland, France, Germany, Spain, Italy, Hong Kong and the US. The company also handed out share options worth nearly \u00a3500,000 to employees \u2013 not including Deliveroo\u2019s couriers, who are all self-employed. Deliveroo riders in some parts of London have sought union recognition as they try and seek better pay and conditions. The bid follows successful protests by riders in the capital who objected to the trial of a new pay structure which would have moved them onto payments per delivery from an hourly rate. As self-employed contractors, Deliveroo couriers are not entitled to the rights available to workers, including sick pay and the national living wage. The firm\u2019s contract even tells those who sign up to make deliveries that they cannot test this status at the employment tribunal \u2013 although lawyers have dismissed this as unenforceable. The accounts for parent company Roofoods Ltd filed in London give only limited information and do not represent the full picture of the group and its subsidiaries around the world. A Deliveroo spokesperson said: \u201cAt Deliveroo our aim is to create the best food delivery experience in the world. In 2015, we invested significantly to help us achieve this. We launched in 10 new countries, drove further expansion in both new and existing markets and continued to develop and invest in improving our offering to customers. \u201cIt is common for ambitious startups to prioritise growth at this stage in their development, and our investments in growth are in line with our long-term strategy.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Britain is in store for a hard Brexit that will hit the UK economy and lay bare the deep divisions in British society, a leading ratings agency has warned. In a bleak assessment of the UK\u2019s prospects following the EU referendum, Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s said Britain was a diminishing global economic power on the verge of losing the ability to freely export goods and services to the EU. S&amp;P said the UK was at risk of a further downgrade, following its unusual decision to slash the rating by two notches from the top AAA rating to AA, following the 23 June referendum. Moritz Kraemer, S&amp;P global ratings chief sovereign credit officer, described that downgrade as \u201can extraordinary rating action, underlining the unprecedented step that is Brexit\u201d. He added: \u201cFar from healing festering wounds, as was then Prime Minister David Cameron\u2019s intention, the referendum has deepened and laid bare the schisms in British society. \u201cMost of the economic impact will hit Britain itself. The second-round effect on the world economy is likely to be more limited, as the UK economy accounts for a small and shrinking share of global GDP.\u201d The agency cited data from the International Monetary Fund, which suggested the UK\u2019s share of the world economy will shrink from about 5% in 1980 to just over 3% in 2020. Kraemer said: \u201cIt is hard to fathom how a rather hard Brexit can be avoided unless both sides become much more flexible than they appear today. Nothing today suggests that a common quest for compromise will overcome the gulf that now looks as wide as the English Channel.\u201d S&amp;P said the \u201cnegative\u201d outlook on the UK\u2019s sovereign rating reflected the multiple risks associated with the decision to leave the EU, exacerbated by Britain\u2019s diminishing ability to respond to those risks. \u201cThis assertion is based on what we view as the UK\u2019s weaker institutional capacity for effective, predictable, and stable policymaking.\u201d S&amp;P was the last of the three main ratings agencies to strip the UK of its prestigious triple A rating. Moody\u2019s and Fitch delivered the blow in 2013.",

    "webTitle": "UK construction at weakest level for four years as housebuilding stalls", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The construction sector suffered its worst quarter for four years following the vote to leave the EU and, in a blow to government hopes for better housing supply, homebuilding stalled. Official figures showed output in the construction sector, which accounts for 6% of the UK economy, slipped by 1.1% in the July to September quarter from the previous quarter. That echoed reports from builders after the Brexit vote that economic uncertainty was hitting their order books. But the figures from the Office for National Statistics on Friday were slightly better than its earlier estimate that construction output had fallen 1.4% in the quarter. Figures for September alone showed a small month-on-month rise in output of 0.3%, beating forecasts for a 0.2% dip in a Reuters poll of economists. The details of the latest report will make disappointing reading for the government as it bids to get housebuilding going to address a chronic shortage of housing in the UK. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, is expected to use his autumn statement on 23 November to set out measures to increase housing supply. The ONS said total new housing recorded no growth in the third quarter, following a small dip the previous quarter. \u201cGiven the UK\u2019s acute housing shortage, the government will be disappointed to see that new house building was only flat quarter-on-quarter in the third quarter,\u201d said Howard Archer, economist at the consultancy IHS Global Insight. But housebuilder Redrow noted that housing was still up 8.7% when compared with the same period in 2015 as private new housing increased by 10.8% but public new housing \u2013 a much smaller part of the sector \u2013 fell 3.1%. John Tutte, chief executive officer at Redrow, said the year-on-year figures painted a \u201cmuch-improving picture for housing over the last year\u201d. \u201cThis trend chimes with our own recent positive figures which revealed that last year we increased completions on homes by 17%, with our forward order book at record levels,\u201d said Tutte. \u201cDemand for homes is still incredibly high, a trend even Brexit has failed to dampen in our recent experience, and we have geared up our business for growth in response.\u201d Hammond is also expected to announce more spending on infrastructure as he pares back the previous chancellor George Osborne\u2019s austerity drive and looks for ways to shore up economic activity as the UK starts negotiations to leave the EU. The latest ONS figures on infrastructure, which includes projects such as road building and railways, showed output increased by 1.2% in July to September. That was the first quarter-on-quarter increase in infrastructure for more than a year. But compared with the same period a year ago there was a fall of 7.7% in output. Commenting on the first full quarter of construction data since the referendum, ONS statistician Kate Davies said small rises in infrastructure and public building work had been offset by large falls in repair and maintenance work, down 3.4% on the quarter. \u201cConstruction output has remained broadly flat in the last year, both before and after the recent referendum,\u201d she said. The construction sector is still recovering from a deep recession prompted by the global financial crisis. Economists expect the Brexit vote and protracted process of leaving the EU will weigh it down further. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at the consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: \u201cThe downturn in construction output in the third quarter is shallower than the ONS initially estimated, but the sector still faces severe challenges ahead. \u201cThe construction sector\u2019s outlook will brighten if the chancellor cancels planned cuts to public sector investment in the autumn statement later this month. But unlike other indicators, firms\u2019 investment intentions have not recovered since the Brexit vote, so commercial construction still looks set to weaken. \u201cMeanwhile, demand for new homes likely will deteriorate next year as households\u2019 real incomes are squeezed by high inflation and as lenders reflect the recent sharp rise in funding costs in mortgage rates.\u201d Kay Daniel Neufeld, economist at the consultancy Cebr, said that aside from Brexit uncertainty the sector faces various other challenges, including regulatory hurdles and skills shortages. Looking ahead to the UK outside the EU, he added: \u201cStricter immigration controls would further exacerbate the problem for the UK construction sector.\u201d",

But unlike other indicators, firms\u2019 investment intentions have not recovered since the Brexit vote, so commercial construction still looks set to weaken.</p> <p>\u201cMeanwhile, demand for new homes likely will deteriorate next year as households\u2019 real incomes are squeezed by high inflation and as lenders reflect the recent sharp rise in funding costs in mortgage rates.\u201d</p> <p>Kay Daniel Neufeld, economist at the consultancy Cebr, said that aside from Brexit uncertainty the sector faces various other challenges, including regulatory hurdles and skills shortages.</p> <p>Looking ahead to the UK outside the EU, he added: \u201cStricter immigration controls would further exacerbate the problem for the UK construction sector.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Amazon delivery drivers admitted breaking speed limits and said they did not always have time for toilet breaks because of the pressure to stay on schedule, according to a BBC investigation. Drivers for companies contracted to work for the online retailer told an undercover reporter that they were expected to deliver up to 200 parcels a day. The report also claimed some drivers said they were effectively paid less than the minimum wage of \u00a37.20, because of the long hours worked to deliver all their assigned parcels. A spokesman for Amazon said: \u201cOver 100 small and medium-sized businesses across the UK are providing work opportunities to thousands of people delivering parcels to Amazon customers. We are committed to ensuring that the people contracted by our independent delivery providers are fairly compensated, treated with respect, follow all applicable laws and drive safely.\u201d An undercover BBC reporter took a job with AHC services, one of the agencies that supplies drivers to Amazon Logistics to deliver parcels. The reporter worked for two weeks based at Amazon\u2019s Avonmouth depot in Bristol, and claimed he worked more than 11 hours a day delivering parcels, which was against the law. \u201cOur delivery providers are obligated to ensure that drivers do not spend more than 10 hours per day driving,\u201d Amazon\u2019s spokesman said. \u201cAs independent contractors of our delivery providers, drivers deliver at their own pace, take breaks at their discretion, and are able to choose the suggested route or develop their own.\u201d Amazon said that over the past six months, the average driving time for drivers in the UK was 8.5 hours a day. The reporter also said he was paid \u00a393.47 for three days\u2019 work in his first week, following deductions such as optional van hire for a week, and insurance. That was the equivalent of \u00a32.59 an hour. He received the equivalent of \u00a34.76 an hour in his second week when he worked four days. The BBC said Amazon Logistics required agency drivers to be self-employed, and therefore not entitled to the national minimum wage (for staff under 25) and the national living wage (over 25) or employment rights such as sick pay or holiday pay. Amazon said: \u201cOur delivery providers have always been expected to pay more than the national living wage, and we recently clarified with all of our delivery providers that we expect drivers to receive a minimum of \u00a312 per hour before bonuses, incentives and fuel reimbursements.\u201d Former driver Charlie Chikaviro said the pressure to deliver parcels left him with no choice but to drive fast. \u201cI had to, the way it was designed. You\u2019re going to have to do that. I had a few crashes ... but not bad crashes,\u201d he said. The Oxford-based AHC dismissed the BBC claims as \u201chistoric and based on isolated examples which occurred over a year ago\u201d. It told the BBC: \u201cSince then we have made changes to the way our checks are carried out and taken a number of steps to improve our ways of working.\u201d The firm also said it took road safety and the welfare of its contracted drivers seriously and that drivers were free to choose when they worked.",

Investors took fright as the company warned that trading had been weaker than expected following the EU referendum, with a \u201cdistinct slowdown\u201d in its traditionally strongest months of September and October. The company was the biggest faller on the FTSE 250 as it warned full-year profits were now expected at between \u00a375m and \u00a380m, lower than the \u00a390m City analysts had been forecasting. The company said: \u201cFollowing a slowing of activity around the time of the EU referendum, trading conditions in the UK have continued to soften and competition in the market has intensified.\u201d It said the group had been hit by delays to some projects in the commercial sector and weak demand for specialist insulation among petrochemicals and manufacturing customers. The company, which supplies insulation, roofing, commercial interiors and other building products, said it would be closing about 20 to 30 branches and cutting some jobs to reduce costs. The chief executive, Stuart Mitchell, is leaving by \u201cmutual agreement with immediate effect\u201d. Leslie Van de Walle, chairman, said that at a time when the business was under pressure, they \u201cneeded a way to accelerate opportunities\u201d under new leadership. A spokesman confirmed that Mitchell was entitled to receive a payoff of up to \u00a3558,250, representing his annual salary. But the exact amount would depend on whether he stepped into a new role elsewhere. Mel Ewell, a non-executive director, is standing in as chief executive while the board finds Mitchell\u2019s permanent replacement.

    "webTitle": "Amazon to spread Black Friday sales over two weeks", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Amazon is to extend its Black Friday promotion to almost two weeks as retailers gear up for the biggest shopping day of the year. Billions of pounds is expected to be spent by shoppers over the Black Friday weekend, starting 25 November, and over the 12 days in the run-up to it. Last year, on Black Friday, Amazon sold more than 7.4m items in the UK, a record for the company involving sales at a rate of 86 items a second. Black Friday has grown rapidly in the UK after Amazon transferred the idea from across the Atlantic in 2010 by offering deals to British customers. This year, starting on 14 November, Amazon intends to offer discounts on products over the 12 days in the run-up to Black Friday. It will offer double the number of deals compared to last year. The online retailer said it was extending its promotions, which ran for about a week last year, in response to customer feedback. The announcement shows that retailers are preparing for another hectic period of shopping, but also that they are trying to spread out consumer spending. Black Friday has been marred by chaotic scenes in shops as people have rushed to pick up discounts and websites have crashed due to the number of visits. Black Friday involves online and high-street retailers offering a range of discounts on products. Its origins are disputed but the craze began in the US about 50 years ago. Black Friday is the day after the public holiday for Thanksgiving. Retailers have traditionally cut their prices to encourage consumers back into the shops. Some claim the name can be traced back to the police in Philadelphia, who gave the nickname to the day after Thanksgiving because of the chaos that ensued in the city as shoppers headed to the high street at the same time as spectators went to the annual Army vs Navy American football match. However, some retail historians claim the day is called Black Friday because it marks the day when retailers move from making a loss to a profit for the first time in the year. Black Friday led to scuffles in British supermarkets when Asda and Tesco ran in-store promotions in 2013 and 2014. Police had to be called to Tesco stores in 2014 as shoppers scrambled to pick up deals. Britain\u2019s biggest retailer was subsequently criticised for launching its Black Friday deals at midnight. However, last year Black Friday was a more subdued occasion in supermarkets and high streets, with shoppers choosing to look for deals online instead of in shops. Tesco delayed the opening of its shops until 5am, leading to much smaller queues outside its supermarkets. The surge in spending on Black Friday in the last six years has transformed the build-up to Christmas for retailers in Britain. It has brought forward spending from December and concentrated it in a tighter period, putting pressure on shops, websites and warehouses. Amazon has more than doubled its UK workforce for November and December, bringing in 20,000 temporary seasonal workers. Doug Gurr, the UK country manager for Amazon, said: \u201cIn response to positive customer feedback for Black Friday deals, we are introducing the Black Friday Sale \u2013 12 days of fantastic deals on must-have gifts and products, saving our customers millions of pounds. \u201cWe\u2019re also thrilled to have over 1,000 small businesses featuring in our Black Friday sale, broadening the selection for our customers and enabling those businesses to boost their sales in the run-up to Christmas.\u201d Although Black Friday is the biggest shopping day in Britain and the US, Singles\u2019 Day in China is the biggest day for shopping worldwide. This day, a Friday, has been promoted as a shopping event by Alibaba, the Chinese online retailer. Analysts at the accountancy firm KMPG believe sales could exceed $20bn (\u00a316bn) this year, up from $14bn last year. Alibaba will kick off its Singles\u2019 Day promotions with a televised gala on Thursday evening, with David Beckham replacing the singer Katy Perry as the event\u2019s \u201cglobal ambassador\u201d after she pulled out at the last minute. Paul Martin, head of UK retail at KPMG, said: \u201cGiven the continual growth in popularity of Chinese Singles\u2019 Day, there is no doubt that sales this year will be bigger than ever. It reinforces the growing buying power of the Chinese consumer and the increasing prominence of the date in the retail calendar. \u201cWith such consumer attention placed on Singles\u2019 Day, we could see sales jump significantly as major campaigns launched in Hong Kong and Taiwan encourage consumers to join in the action.\u201d",

Black Friday has been marred by chaotic scenes in shops as people have rushed to pick up discounts and websites have crashed due to the number of visits.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3b806bd8b196f558856f522738d45efb50150685\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3b806bd8b196f558856f522738d45efb50150685/0_184_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Shoppers in Macy\u2019s store, Herald Square, New York, as Black Friday sales started in 2015.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shoppers in Macy\u2019s store, Herald Square, New York, as Black Friday sales started in 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kena Betancur/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/black-friday\">Black Friday</a> involves online and high-street retailers offering a range of discounts on products. Its origins are disputed but the craze began in the US about 50 years ago. Black Friday is the day after the public holiday for Thanksgiving. Retailers have traditionally cut their prices to encourage consumers back into the shops.</p> <p>Some claim the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/nov/26/what-is-black-friday-biggest-uk-shopping-day\">name can be traced back to the police in Philadelphia</a>, who gave the nickname to the day after Thanksgiving because of the chaos that ensued in the city as shoppers headed to the high street at the same time as spectators went to the annual Army vs Navy American football match. However, some retail historians claim the day is called Black Friday because it marks the day when retailers move from making a loss to a profit for the first time in the year.</p> <p>Black Friday led to scuffles in British supermarkets when Asda and Tesco ran in-store promotions in 2013 and 2014. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/video/2014/nov/28/black-friday-police-tesco-shopper-scuffles-video\">Police had to be called to Tesco stores in 2014</a> as shoppers scrambled to pick up deals. Britain\u2019s biggest retailer was subsequently criticised for launching its Black Friday deals at midnight.</p> <p>However, last year Black Friday was a more subdued occasion in supermarkets and high streets, with shoppers choosing to look for deals online instead of in shops. Tesco delayed the opening of its shops until 5am, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/nov/27/mince-pies-not-mini-riots-cautious-shops-open-for-black-friday\">leading to much smaller queues outside its supermarkets.</a><br></p> <p>The surge in spending on Black Friday in the last six years has transformed the build-up to Christmas for retailers in Britain. It has brought forward spending from December and concentrated it in a tighter period, putting pressure on shops, websites and warehouses.</p> <p>Amazon has more than doubled its UK workforce for November and December, bringing in 20,000 temporary seasonal workers.</p> <p>Doug Gurr, the UK country manager for Amazon, said: \u201cIn response to positive customer feedback for Black Friday deals, we are introducing the Black Friday Sale \u2013 12 days of fantastic deals on must-have gifts and products, saving our customers millions of pounds.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re also thrilled to have over 1,000 small businesses featuring in our Black Friday sale, broadening the selection for our customers and enabling those businesses to boost their sales in the run-up to Christmas.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"587d804464ec3a014c027ca08329c1ab0964d243\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/587d804464ec3a014c027ca08329c1ab0964d243/0_17_4032_2420/1000.jpg\" alt=\"In China\u2019s Jiangsu province packers get ready for Singles\u2019 Day.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In China\u2019s Jiangsu province packers get ready for Singles\u2019 Day.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Imaginechina/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Although Black Friday is the biggest shopping day in Britain and the US, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media-network/2016/nov/08/singles-day-new-black-friday-british-retailers-waitrose\">Singles\u2019 Day</a> in China is the biggest day for shopping worldwide. This day, a Friday, has been promoted as a shopping event by Alibaba, the Chinese online retailer. Analysts at the accountancy firm KMPG believe sales could exceed $20bn (\u00a316bn) this year, up from $14bn last year.</p> <p>Alibaba will kick off its Singles\u2019 Day promotions with a televised gala on Thursday evening, with David Beckham replacing the singer Katy Perry as the event\u2019s \u201cglobal ambassador\u201d after she pulled out at the last minute. </p> <p>Paul Martin, head of UK retail at KPMG, said: \u201cGiven the continual growth in popularity of Chinese Singles\u2019 Day, there is no doubt that sales this year will be bigger than ever. It reinforces the growing buying power of the Chinese consumer and the increasing prominence of the date in the retail calendar. </p> <p>\u201cWith such consumer attention placed on Singles\u2019 Day, we could see sales jump significantly as major campaigns launched in Hong Kong and Taiwan encourage consumers to join in the action.\u201d</p>",
