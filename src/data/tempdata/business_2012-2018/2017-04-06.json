      "bodyText": "The 78-year-old boss of Laura Ashley has been ordered to pay his ex-wife \u00a364m to settle their long-running divorce row. Pauline Chai, who was crowned Miss Malaysia in 1969, was seeking \u00a3100m from Khoo Kay Peng following their split after 42 years of marriage. She claimed their assets were worth at least \u00a3205m. She claimed she had contributed to her husband\u2019s success by being a \u201ctraditional\u201d wife, and that she and Khoo had made a sharing agreement entitling her to half of the family wealth. Khoo, who is non-executive chair of Laura Ashley Holdings, argued that his former wife should only receive \u00a39m. On Thursday, Mr Justice Bodey ruled Chai should receive a \u00a364m settlement made up of cash and property. Chai and Khoo married in 1970 and had five children together before splitting in 2012. Since separating, they have spent more than \u00a36m between them on lawyers to fight their financial dispute. In January, lawyers representing Chai said she had been granted a decree absolute, nearly four years after filing for divorce. A family judge had signalled the end of the marriage a year ago by granting a decree nisi. Khoo, who is based in Malaysia, said the marital home was in Malaysia and believed a judge there should decide on the division of money. He said Chai wanted the hearing to be held in England because an English judge would give her a more generous award, while she argued they moved their home to Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire, before separating and therefore decisions should be made in an English court. Khoo has since returned to Kuala Lumpur. During the hearings, Khoo compared Chai to Imelda Marcos because of her love of shopping and her 1,000-strong shoe collection. Chai said her ex-husband had \u201calways\u201d told her \u201cwhat\u2019s mine is yours\u201d. Chai claimed she and Khoo had made a sharing agreement and said she owned half of the \u201cfamily\u2019s business empire\u201d. She said he was the \u201cpaper owner\u201d but, in substance, assets were jointly owned. \u201cI looked at marriage in the traditional way,\u201d Chai had told Mr Justice Bodey at hearings in the family division of the high court in London. \u201cHe is the breadwinner and I stayed at home and looked after the children. It was a daunting task.\u201d Bodey\u2019s detailed ruling on exactly who gets what in the financial settlement of assets is expected to be published in the near future. The case was heard in private, but journalists were granted the right to name Khoo and Chai and report some information. The judge has barred reporting of revealing confidential financial material.",

The key thing is to look carefully what you are doing.

For one attendee the event rekindled happy memories.

And it\u2019s not just about potatoes. The department store reckons that people can find solace and contentment from other basic activities and rituals, so there are other group activities planned, like lessons in how to grind spices by hand, tie herb bundles, and even make tea, using leaves rather than a teabag. It all takes place in a semi-darkened \u201cconceptual farmhouse\u201d in the shop\u2019s basement. Participants gain admission by ringing a cow bell, and have to remove their shoes and put away their mobile phones. Those feeling a tad tired can lie down and have a nap on a straw bed.

    "webTitle": "Low interest rates put global financial sector at risk, IMF warns", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A prolonged period of low interest rates will tempt banks to take greater risks and sound the death knell for final salary pensions, the International Monetary Fund has warned. A new study from the IMF said a continuation of the cheap borrowing environment seen since the global financial crisis a decade ago would pose a \u201csignificant challenge\u201d to financial institutions and force them to make fundamental changes to their business models. Although interest rates have recently started to rise in the US, the IMF said Japan\u2019s experience suggested an imminent and permanent end to the current low interest rate environment could not be guaranteed. Some economists, such as the former US treasury secretary Larry Summers, say the global economy is gripped by so-called secular stagnation, in which excessive savings and weak investment lead to weaker growth and lower interest rates. The IMF, in a chapter from its forthcoming Global Financial Stability Review, said the decline in real (inflation-adjusted) interest rates since the mid-1980s had been caused by slow-moving structural factors such as weaker growth and the desire of an ageing population to save more for their retirement. It was possible that the pace of innovation had slowed, while rising savings and an appetite for advanced-country financial assets in emerging nations had also put downward pressure on interest rates in the west over the past 15 years. Japan has had ultra-low interest rates for almost three decades, while other developed countries cut borrowing costs aggressively in response to the deep financial and economic crisis that began almost a decade ago. The Bank of England held borrowing costs at 0.5% for more than seven years before cutting them to 0.25% last August, the lowest level in its 323-year history. The European Central Bank has adopted a similar approach and its president, Mario Draghi, has said there would be no early rate rise for the eurozone. The IMF said a low interest rate environment would hit the earnings of banks and pose \u201clong-lasting challenges for life insurers and defined-benefit pensions funds\u201d. It added: \u201cSmaller, deposit-funded and less diversified banks would be hurt most, which could increase the pressure to consolidate. As banks reach for yield at home and abroad, new financial stability challenges may arise in their home and host markets. These hypotheses are supported by the experience of Japanese banks.\u201d Life insurers and pension funds would probably need to raise more capital because permanently low interest rates would make it more difficult to make the returns needed to fund existing liabilities taken on when borrowing costs were higher. The IMF said defined-benefit schemes \u2013 already under threat in many developed countries \u2013 would tend to become less attractive than defined-contribution schemes, where the risk is taken by the employee rather than the employer. The study said ageing populations would mean a reduction in demand for credit but increase demand for health and long-term care insurance. Smaller banks would need to consolidate and policymakers would need to beware of calls for a softer touch regulatory regime. \u201cPrudential frameworks would need to provide incentives to ensure longer-term stability instead of falling prey to demands for deregulation to ease the short-term pain,\u201d the IMF said. It said efforts should be made not just to facilitate consolidation of smaller banks but also to \u201climit excessive risk-taking and avoid a worsening of the too-big-to-fail problem\u201d. The IMF\u2019s view that low interest rates might be here to stay was challenged by the ratings agency Fitch, which said borrowers should prepare for a significant shift in the global interest rate environment over the next few years. Fitch said it expected US real interest rates to increase to levels that were more closely aligned with the country\u2019s economic growth potential, taking them close to pre-crisis levels. \u201cWith the Fed having now achieved its inflation and employment objectives, becoming more focused on the risk of labour market tightening and starting to discuss the unwinding of its balance sheet, we expect interest rate normalisation will take place by 2020 and that the Fed Funds rate will reach 3.5% to 4%,\u201d said Brian Coulton, chief economist at Fitch. Markets currently believe the Fed will need to make only modest adjustments to official US interest rates in the coming years, with the Fed Funds rate unlikely to rise much above 2% by 2020. Fitch said it did not accept that there had been a lasting shift to a new equilibrium.",

Some economists, such as the former US treasury secretary Larry Summers, say the global economy is gripped by so-called <a href=\"http://larrysummers.com/2016/02/17/the-age-of-secular-stagnation/\">secular stagnation</a>, in which excessive savings and weak investment lead to weaker growth and lower interest rates.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2017/apr/06/markets-slide-after-federal-reserve-surprise-and-ahead-of-trump-china-meeting-business-live\">Markets volatile after Federal Reserve surprise and ahead of Trump China meeting - business live</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The IMF, in a chapter from its forthcoming Global Financial Stability Review, said the decline in real (inflation-adjusted) interest rates since the mid-1980s had been caused by slow-moving structural factors such as weaker growth and the desire of an ageing population to save more for their retirement. </p> <p>It was possible that the pace of innovation had slowed, while rising savings and an appetite for advanced-country financial assets in emerging nations had also put downward pressure on interest rates in the west over the past 15 years.</p> <p>Japan has had ultra-low interest rates for almost three decades, while other developed countries cut borrowing costs aggressively in response to the deep financial and economic crisis that began almost a decade ago.</p> <p>The Bank of England held borrowing costs at 0.5% for more than seven years <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/04/bank-of-england-cuts-uk-interest-rates\">before cutting them to 0.25% last August</a>, the lowest level in its 323-year history. The European Central Bank has adopted a similar approach and its president, Mario Draghi, has said there would be no early rate rise for the eurozone.</p> <p>The IMF said a low interest rate environment would hit the earnings of banks and pose \u201clong-lasting challenges for life insurers and defined-benefit pensions funds\u201d.</p> <p>It added: \u201cSmaller, deposit-funded and less diversified banks would be hurt most, which could increase the pressure to consolidate. As banks reach for yield at home and abroad, new financial stability challenges may arise in their home and host markets. These hypotheses are supported by the experience of Japanese banks.\u201d</p> <p>Life insurers and pension funds would probably need to raise more capital because permanently low interest rates would make it more difficult to make the returns needed to fund existing liabilities taken on when borrowing costs were higher.</p> <p>The IMF said defined-benefit schemes \u2013 already under threat in many developed countries \u2013 would tend to become less attractive than defined-contribution schemes, where the risk is taken by the employee rather than the employer.</p> <p>The study said ageing populations would mean a reduction in demand for credit but increase demand for health and long-term care insurance. Smaller banks would need to consolidate and policymakers would need to beware of calls for a softer touch regulatory regime.</p> <p>\u201cPrudential frameworks would need to provide incentives to ensure longer-term stability instead of falling prey to demands for deregulation to ease the short-term pain,\u201d the IMF said.</p> <p>It said efforts should be made not just to facilitate consolidation of smaller banks but also to \u201climit excessive risk-taking and avoid a worsening of the too-big-to-fail problem\u201d.</p> <p>The IMF\u2019s view that low interest rates might be here to stay was challenged by the ratings agency Fitch, which said borrowers should prepare for a significant shift in the global interest rate environment over the next few years.</p> <p>Fitch said it expected US real interest rates to increase to levels that were more closely aligned with the country\u2019s economic growth potential, taking them close to pre-crisis levels. </p> <p>\u201cWith the Fed having now achieved its inflation and employment objectives, becoming more focused on the risk of labour market tightening and starting to discuss the unwinding of its balance sheet, we expect interest rate normalisation will take place by 2020 and that the Fed Funds rate will reach 3.5% to 4%,\u201d said Brian Coulton, chief economist at Fitch. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Markets currently believe the Fed will need to make only modest adjustments to official US interest rates in the coming years, with the Fed Funds rate unlikely to rise much above 2% by 2020.

      "bodyText": "US markets made an uncertain start to trading in the wake of the surprise hints by the Federal Reserve that it was looking at shrinking its balance sheet by the end of the year. There was also some nervousness as President Trump met his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping. With a fall in financial shares following the Fed news balanced by gains in energy shares as oil prices edged higher, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up around 8 points. The S&amp;P 500 opened 0.34% lower while the Nasdaq Composite added 0.11%. On that note, we\u2019ll close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. And to Greece where senior European officials are voicing optimism that tortuous negotiations over the country\u2019s long-stalled bailout programme are on the verge of being wrapped up. From Athens our correspondent Helena Smith reports: In Berlin, Brussels and Athens senior officials, including the German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, are expressing optimism that talks over the latest compliance review between Greece and its creditors can finally be concluded. Sch\u00e4uble said he was upbeat an agreement would soon be reached. Whether it could be clinched at tomorrow\u2019s eurogroup meeting of finance ministers, however, remained to be seen, he added. The remarks were echoed by prime minister Alexis Tsipras who used the opening this afternoon of a new stretch of motorway between Athens and Thessaloniki in the north to say completion of an all-conclusive deal was imminent. The review is key to disbursement of \u20ac7.5bn in fresh loans needed to repay maturing debt in July - crucial to Europe averting a new Greek crisis. \u201cWhether some want it or not, the completion of the review is very near,\u201d he told an assembled gathering of notaries including the EU\u2019s commissioner for regional policy Corina Cretu. \u201cGreece will finally attain an all-conclusive agreement which will open the way for its exit from [bailout] programmes of economic stewardship. Despite the naysayers it will regain the power to stand on its own feet.\u201d The agreement, he said, would not only bring interminable negotiations to an end but include the \u201cnecessary measures\u201d Greece needs to reduce its unmanageable debt burden \u2013 at 180% of GDP the highest in the EU. The delivery of the long-awaited motorway was symbolic in that it sent out the message that \u201cyes, we can do it, and we will do it. We are determined to get the country out of crisis and no one, in the end, will manage to prevent us.\u201d The much-delayed review has cost Greece dearly. In the uncertainty banks have again reported a massive flight of capital since January with major investments also being put on hold. The German chancellor Angela Merkel is reported to have also intervened, calling Tsipras personally on Wednesday after he upped the ante and called for an emergency meeting of EU leaders if the review wasn\u2019t wrapped up at Friday\u2019s eurogroup in Malta. The cut in BP boss Bob Dudley\u2019s pay and the changes to the oil company\u2019s remuneration policies have been welcomed by Royal London Asset Management, which owns \u00a3679m worth of shares in the business. Ashley Hamilton Claxton, Royal London\u2019s corporate governance manager, said: The 2017 pay policy looks set to significantly reduce the total pay that Mr Dudley will be awarded going forward. It is rare for a company to consult with us on proposals for reducing pay, setting an example for other companies holding binding votes this year. We applaud the BP remuneration committee for being proactive in responding to the shareholder revolt last year and see this as a milestone in the engagement between companies and shareholders. In particular, the committee applied discretion to override the formulaic outcome of the pay policy, which is a welcome step in the right direction. Ahead of Friday\u2019s US non-farm payroll numbers and following better than expected private sector jobs data on Wednesday comes another sign of an improving labour market. New claims for unemployment fell by 25,000 to a seasonally adjusted 234,000 last week, the biggest drop in nearly two years. The previous week\u2019s level was revised up by 1,000 to 259,000.Claims have been below 300,000 - seen as a sign of a healthy jobs market - for 109 straight weeks. More price rises are on the way for hard hit consumers, this time for children\u2019s goods. Zoe Wood writes: Mothercare chief executive Mark Newton-Jones said the price of its clothing and toys would increase by 3-5% this summer following the decline in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote. Newton Jones said it had mitigated price rises by striking better deals with suppliers but with half its goods bought in dollars the retailer was not able to absorb higher sourcing costs. \u201cFrom the middle of the year our selling prices will move by 3 to 5% as that inflation flows through,\u201d he said. With its focus on childrenswear Newton-Jones said the price increases would not be material, for example adding 40p to the cost of a babygrow. The retailer also owns the Early Learning Centre toy brand. His comments came as the retailer said UK like-for-like sales were up 4.5% in 11 weeks to 25 March which was better than some analysts expected, sending the shares up more than 2%. Newton-Jones was hired in 2014 to lead a turnaround of Mothercare but confidence was knocked by poor trading last summer. Canaccord Genuity analyst Sanjay Vidyarthi said the management\u2019s recovery strategy looked to be back on track with the UK chain turning a profit over the last six months - its first profitable half since 2011. \u201cThis is very encouraging, given how difficult and volatile trading conditions have been on the high street, particularly in clothing,\u201d he said. The Czech koruna has jumped 1.5% against the euro after the country\u2019s central bank dropped the currency peg which had been in place for three and a half years. But the move was not unexpected so there was little real disruption in the market. Kathleen Brooks at City Index said: If you want to drop a currency peg, then the Czech national bank can show you how to do it... Dismantling a long-held currency regime doesn\u2019t need to be as volatile or panic-stricken as Swiss peg debacle back in 2015. The timing of dropping the peg has been pre-emptive: the economy isn\u2019t too hot that the CNB desperately needs a stronger currency, neither are bond yields too high, which means the CNB doesn\u2019t have to worry about hiking interest rates. Instead, the CNB can keep a steady ship for now, although it will want to have one eye on inflation, which has risen to 2.5%, the highest level since the end of 2012. We don\u2019t expect the CNB to hike interest rates yet, although this could be on cards for the summer months. If the CNB does hike rates then we would expect koruna appreciation against the euro. So far with the ECB we\u2019ve had Draghi and Praet on one side and Weidmann on the other. Now this: A quick look at the markets and they have recovered from their worst levels as the day wears on. The current state of play is: The FTSE 100 is 0.24% lower Germany\u2019s Dax is down 0.19% France\u2019s Cac is now up 0.22% Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB has added 0.19% Spain\u2019s Ibex is up 0.41% The Athens market has added 0.41% And in the US, the futures are suggesting a 23 point opening rise on the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Bob Dudley, the chief executive of BP, has seen his total pay package cut by 40% as the oil firm responds to the backlash against excessive executive pay. Dudley\u2019s remuneration for 2016 including pension was $11.6m (\u00a39m) compared to $19.4m. His annual bonus was reduced from $4.2m to $2.5m. Last year some 59% of BP shareholders opposed Dudley\u2019s pay package, which rose 20% despite the company reporting record losses. Finance director Brian Gilvary has seen his pay fall from \u00a35.1m to \u00a34.2m. BP said Dudley\u2019s basis salary would be frozen at $1.854m for 2017, and from this year the level of executive bonuses paid for meeting targets would be cut by 25%. The amount of bonus which must be taken as shares will be increased from 33% to 50%. Dudley\u2019s long term incentives will be reduced from seven times salary to a maximum of five times salary. Back, again, with the European Central Bank and board member and head of Germany\u2019s Bundesbank Jens Weidmann is taking a more hawkish task than the earlier comments from Mario Draghi and Peter Praet. In a speech in Berlin (in German here) he said: I could have imagined a less expansive monetary policy, especially as many economic indicators developed positively....Given the prospect of a protracted, robust economic recovery in the euro area and an increase in price pressure, it is legitimate to ask when the ECB Council should consider monetary policy normalization and how it could adapt its communication in advance. The Bundesbank has wanted the ECB to wind down its stimulus programme for some while so the remarks are no surprise, although they have pulled the euro back from its decline in the immediate aftermath of the Draghi and Praet commments: A day after a report that the UK lagged the rest of the G7 on productivity, the Office for National Statistics is holding a forum on the subject. My colleague Katie Allen is there: As Greece continues to attempt agreement with its creditors ahead of a eurogroup meeting on Friday, new figures show the scale of the continuing unemployment problem in the country. The jobless rate in January stood at 23.5%, while December\u2019s rate was revised up from 23.1% to - again - 23.5%. The rate for young people between 15 and 24 stood at 48%. Greece\u2019s unemployment is down from its record high of 27.9% in September but is still more than double the average in the rest of the eurozone. Overall retail sales in the eurozone slipped back in March as a rise in Germany was offset by the falls in France and Italy. Markit\u2019s headline eurozone retail PMI came in at 49.5 last month, compared to 49.9 in February. According to the survey, sales were down on an annual basis and in line with the monthly trend, declines in France and Italy were partially offset by a rise in Germany. Markit economist Alex Gill said: The marginal decline in sales highlighted by the headline index covered up a divergence in underlying trends at the country level. Operating conditions in the Italian retail sector remained precarious, as evidenced by another sharp decline in like-for-like sales, compounded by a further fall in gross margins amid strong competitive pressures. Monthly sales also dropped in France for the first time in three months as political uncertainty and inflation began to weigh on consumer demand. In contrast, sales grew at the fastest pace in six months in Germany. Retail sales in Italy have also weakened: But it was a different story in France. With consumer spending flagging due to uncertainty created by the country\u2019s forthcoming presidential election, Markit\u2019s retail sales PMI dropped back into contraction territory in March. It fell from 51.7 in February to 49.4, signalling the first drop in like-for-like sales since November last year. Markit economist Alex Gill said: French retail sales eased slightly in March, thereby reversing the growth trend seen in the previous three months, as political uncertainty with regard to May\u2019s presidential elections put downward pressure on consumer spending. Inflationary pressures may also be starting to erode consumers\u2019 purchasing power. IHS Markit forecasts a 1.3% rise in consumer prices in the first quarter this year, markedly up from the level seen throughout 2016. After reasonable industrial orders figures from Germany earlier, come positive construction and retail sales numbers. According to Markit, the German construction PMI climbed from 54.1 in February to 56.4 last month as optimism hit a record high. This was the strongest rise in construction activity since February 2016, said Markit. Meanwhile Markit said the retail PMI rose from 51.2 in February to 52.5 in March. Its senior economist Trevor Balchin said: The German retail sector continued to recover in March from a weak start to the year. Sales rose at the fastest monthly rate since last September, and returned to growth on the year-on-year measure. The latest survey results also signalled a trend of destocking in the retail sector at the end of the first quarter on a seasonally-adjusted basis, the first contraction in warehouse levels since January 2016. This partly reflected further strong upward pressure on purchase prices as firms looked to protect margins. Back with the European Central Bank and board member Peter Praet has referred to the overlap between his speech in Frankfurt and that of president Mario Draghi: Meanwhile Oxford Economics\u2019 Ben May says: Back with the corporate world, and Unilever has started restructuring in the wake of the failed bid from Kraft Heinz. Julia Kollewe writes: Unilever has put its margarine division, which makes Flora and Stork, up for sale, as it shakes up its business after fending off a $143bn (\u00a3115bn) takeover bid from US rival Kraft Heinz. The Anglo-Dutch consumer group\u2019s underperforming spreads business could fetch up to \u00a36bn in a sale, according to analysts. Private equity firms including CVC and Bain Capital are reportedly circling the division and Kraft could also be interested. Announcing the outcome of a strategic review, Unilever chief executive Paul Polman said: \u201cAfter a long history in Unilever, we have decided that the future of the spreads business now lies outside the group.\u201d Unilever owns a raft of household name products, including Dove soap, Ben &amp; Jerry\u2019s ice cream, Persil washing powder and Marmite. Polman told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme that the margarine business was a \u201cdeclining segment\u201d that could be \u201cbetter managed by others\u201d. Referring to the Kraft bid, he said that \u201cthe events of the last few weeks have pointed out that we have opportunities to drive further value in the business\u201d. The full story is here: Still with the European Central Bank and board member Peter Praet has echoed president Mario Draghi\u2019s view that it is too soon to change tack on policy. In a speech at the same Frankfurt event on \u201cCalibrating unconventional monetary policy\u201d he said: Our monetary policy is working, and we see that, supported by our mutually reinforcing monetary policy measures, the euro area economic recovery is steadily firming. The cyclical recovery is gaining momentum and the expansion is broadening across sectors and countries, showing the effectiveness of the transmission of our measures throughout the entire euro area economy. Yet, the risks to the growth outlook remain tilted to the downside, even though their balance is improving. And, importantly, inflation dynamics continue to be conditional on the present, very substantial degree of monetary accommodation. And he concludes that low interest rates will remain well after the ECB ends its bond buying [quantitative easing] programme: In our expectation, the policy interest rate will remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time and well past the horizon of our net asset purchases. This forward guidance implies a sequencing between the interest rate policy and the quantitative policy that can most efficiently internalise and exploit the intimate complementarities between these two key components of our current stance. The European Central Bank is not planning to reassess its current monetary policy of low interest rates and bond buying, says its president Mario Draghi. In a speech in Frankfurt he said the current stance was still appropriate and before making any alterations, the bank needed to see more signs that inflation was approaching its target. So far there was not enough evidence to significantly change its forecasts although there were signs of recovery: Though the risks to the growth outlook remain tilted to the downside \u2013 mainly on account of [geo-political factors] \u2013 the balance seems to be shifting upwards. This is reflected in recent sentiment indicators, which suggest that the recovery may be gaining momentum. But he added: Despite.. signs of progress, it is clearly too soon to declare success. And he defended the bank\u2019s policy which has come under some criticism, notably from Germany, by saying it was a key factor in the recovery in the eurozone econony\u2019s recovery in recent years. He concluded: We are confident that our policy is working and that the outlook for the economy is gradually improving. As a result, the forces that are currently weighing on domestic price pressures should continue to wane. But even so, we have not yet seen sufficient evidence to materially alter our assessment of the inflation outlook \u2013 which remains conditional on a very substantial degree of monetary accommodation. Hence a reassessment of the current monetary policy stance is not warranted at this stage. Before making any alterations to the components of our stance \u2013 interest rates, asset purchases and forward guidance \u2013 we still need to build sufficient confidence that inflation will indeed converge to our aim over a medium-term horizon, and will remain there even in less supportive monetary policy conditions. The dovish tone of the comments has sent the euro lower, especially with the Fed in the process of raising interest rates and beginning to end its accommodative stance this year. The weakness on Wall Street and in Asia has carried over to Europe, as uncertainty over the Federal Reserve\u2019s plans and the Trump/Xi meeting unsettle investors. The FTSE 100 is down nearly 60 points or 0.8% in early trading, while Germany\u2019s Dax, Spain\u2019s Ibex, Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB and France\u2019s Cac have all opened down around 0.6%. On the corporate front we have results from the Co-op Group, which has just reported a loss after the well-documented problems at its banking business. Julia Kollewe reports: The Co-op Group has slid into the red for the first time since 2013 after writing off the value of its 20% stake in the Co-op Bank to zero, as expected. This resulted in a \u00a3140m hit, which was partially offset by one-off gains. The mutual, which now focuses on its grocery chain, funeral homes and insurance services, posted an annual loss before tax of \u00a3132m, against a \u00a323m profit in 2015. It had 4m active members at the end of 2016 and has recruited a further 350,000 this year. Overall revenues were up 3% to \u00a39.5bn, with the Co-op supermarkets enjoying like-for-like sales growth of 3.5%. Chief executive Steve Murrells said while much remains to be done, \u201cwe\u2019ve made great progress in rebuilding our Co-op, with all our businesses delivering strong performances.\u201d The group came close to collapse in 2013 when it slumped to a \u00a3277m loss. Its banking arm was rescued by US hedge funds after the disastrous takeover of the Britannia building society. This was compounded by a scandal around the bank\u2019s former chairman, Paul Flowers, who took class A drugs, and thousands of members left. The Co-op Bank put itself up for sale in February to raise more capital and offer its 4m customers more stability. We\u2019ve already had some fairly positive news from the eurozone, with German factory orders rising in February after a sharp decline in the previous month. New orders climbed by 3.4% month on month after the surprise 6.8% drop in January, although it was still below expectations of a 4% increase. ING economist Carsten Brzeski said: The increase in new orders was exclusively driven by stronger domestic demand. Foreign demand remained stable. A bit worrisome is the fact that new orders from other Eurozone countries have dropped for the second consecutive month. The surge in new orders from other Eurozone countries at the end of last year has now entirely vanished into thin air, adding a slightly disappointing note to the current picture of a Eurozone recovery. Obviously, new orders have always been volatile but the fluctuations and size of volatility since late-summer have been almost unprecedented. German order books seem to be extremely moody, reacting sensitively to seasonal and weather moods. Looking through this high volatility, the trend for order books is slightly positive, though still not as positive and strong as current confidence indicators are suggesting. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Investors appear nervous ahead of a meeting between US president Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping. Trump, of course, said one of his first acts as president would be to label China a currency manipulator, but he has taken a more conciliatory tone since actually coming into power. Even so, with North Korea firing another missile this week, the meeting could be a tense one. Markets had already been unsettled by the latest minutes from the Federal Reserve. The US central bank is keen not to upset the applecart but seems to have done so anyway. To much surprise, the Fed indicated it expected to start shrinking its $4.5trn balance sheet later this year, earlier than expected. The bank has build up a portfolio of bonds and mortgage backed securities as part of its stimulus measures in the wake of the global financial crisis, and reducing those assets would be a key moment in moving back to more normal circumstances. Barclays analysts said: To our surprise, the minutes to the March meeting contained extensive discussion on balance sheet policies. We had expected this discussion to take place at the June FOMC meeting, with subsequent deliberations communicated around the timing of the annual Economic Symposium at Jackson Hole in August. However, the committee moved quicker than we anticipated, and staff weighed in with various alternative scenarios during the March meeting. The desire to signal sooner than later is likely a function of the committee\u2019s wish to avoid adverse market reactions. If that was the aim, it seems to have failed. The length of the discussion on this move and the uncertainty it casts over future interest rate rises saw Wall Street turn sharply lower after strong gains earlier on. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which at one point on Thursday was nearly 200 points higher, ended down 41 points following the minutes. Asian markets followed suit, with Japan\u2019s Nikkei falling 1.4% to a four month low. European markets are forecast to follow suit: There were other concerns, with a disappointing Chinese service sector survey. Michael Hewson at CMC Markets said: A disappointing Caixin services PMI number from China...showed that economic activity, though positive hit its lowest level since September last year, casting doubt on the robustness of recent officials data, which panted a far rosier picture. Elsewhere, eurozone retail sales are due later, along with the weekly jobless claims from the US, while European Central Bank president Mario Draghi is due to give a speech in Frankfurt shortly.",

From Athens our correspondent Helena Smith reports:</p> <blockquote> <p>In Berlin, Brussels and Athens senior officials, including the German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, are expressing optimism that talks over the latest compliance review between Greece and its creditors can finally be concluded. Sch\u00e4uble said he was upbeat an agreement would soon be reached. Whether it could be clinched at tomorrow\u2019s eurogroup meeting of finance ministers, however, remained to be seen, he added. </p> <p>The remarks were echoed by prime minister Alexis Tsipras who used the opening this afternoon of a new stretch of motorway between Athens and Thessaloniki in the north to say completion of an all-conclusive deal was imminent. The review is key to disbursement of \u20ac7.5bn in fresh loans needed to repay maturing debt in July - crucial to Europe averting a new Greek crisis. </p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f868a14e74d3d544b541725b2654484e4f3eca91\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f868a14e74d3d544b541725b2654484e4f3eca91/0_203_3856_2314/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tsipras in Athens on Wednesday\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tsipras in Athens on Wednesday</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pacifi/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <blockquote> <p>\u201cWhether some want it or not, the completion of the review is very near,\u201d he told an assembled gathering of notaries including the EU\u2019s commissioner for regional policy Corina Cretu. \u201cGreece will finally attain an all-conclusive agreement which will open the way for its exit from [bailout] programmes of economic stewardship. Despite the naysayers it will regain the power to stand on its own feet.\u201d</p> <p>The agreement, he said, would not only bring interminable negotiations to an end but include the \u201cnecessary measures\u201d Greece needs to reduce its unmanageable debt burden \u2013 at 180% of GDP the highest in the EU. The delivery of the long-awaited motorway was symbolic in that it sent out the message that \u201cyes, we can do it, and we will do it. We are determined to get the country out of crisis and no one, in the end, will manage to prevent us.\u201d </p> <p>The much-delayed review has cost Greece dearly. In the uncertainty banks have again reported a massive flight of capital since January with major investments also being put on hold. The German chancellor Angela Merkel is reported to have also intervened, calling Tsipras personally on Wednesday after he upped the ante and called for an emergency meeting of EU leaders if the review wasn\u2019t wrapped up at Friday\u2019s eurogroup in Malta. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58e6397ee4b05776df18b2a4\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-04-06T12:53:02.553Z\">1.53pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">BP pay move a &quot;step in the right direction&quot; - investor</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2017/apr/06/markets-slide-after-federal-reserve-surprise-and-ahead-of-trump-china-meeting-business-live?page=with:block-58e61a33e4b0e0ec04efe500#block-58e61a33e4b0e0ec04efe500\">cut in BP boss Bob Dudley\u2019s pay </a>and the changes to the oil company\u2019s remuneration policies have been welcomed by Royal London Asset Management, which owns \u00a3679m worth of shares in the business.</p> <p>Ashley Hamilton Claxton, Royal London\u2019s corporate governance manager, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The 2017 pay policy looks set to significantly reduce the total pay that Mr Dudley will be awarded going forward.

With its focus on childrenswear Newton-Jones said the price increases would not be material, for example adding 40p to the cost of a babygrow. The retailer also owns the Early Learning Centre toy brand.</p> <p>His comments came as the retailer said UK like-for-like sales were up 4.5% in 11 weeks to 25 March which was better than some analysts expected, sending the shares up more than 2%. Newton-Jones was hired in 2014 to lead a turnaround of Mothercare but confidence was knocked by poor trading last summer.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>Canaccord Genuity analyst Sanjay Vidyarthi said the management\u2019s recovery strategy looked to be back on track with the UK chain turning a profit over the last six months - its first profitable half since 2011. \u201cThis is very encouraging, given how difficult and volatile trading conditions have been on the high street, particularly in clothing,\u201d he said.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-04-06T12:38:27.655Z\">at 1.38pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-58e6322ae4b05b487c0dfd8f\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-04-06T12:24:53.577Z\">1.24pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Czech central bank drops currency peg with euro</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Czech koruna has jumped 1.5% against the euro after the country\u2019s central bank dropped the currency peg which had been in place for three and a half years.</p> <p>But the move was not unexpected so there was little real disruption in the market. Kathleen Brooks at City Index said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If you want to drop a currency peg, then the Czech national bank can show you how to do it... Dismantling a long-held currency regime doesn\u2019t need to be as volatile or panic-stricken as Swiss peg debacle back in 2015.</p> <p>The timing of dropping the peg has been pre-emptive: the economy isn\u2019t too hot that the CNB desperately needs a stronger currency, neither are bond yields too high, which means the CNB doesn\u2019t have to worry about hiking interest rates. Instead, the CNB can keep a steady ship for now, although it will want to have one eye on inflation, which has risen to 2.5%, the highest level since the end of 2012. We don\u2019t expect the CNB to hike interest rates yet, although this could be on cards for the summer months. If the CNB does hike rates then we would expect koruna appreciation against the euro.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9687c5ec850ebc266601a9b9a80289689d3b16a9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9687c5ec850ebc266601a9b9a80289689d3b16a9/376_215_1517_910/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Czech koruna rises after currency cap dropped\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Czech koruna rises after currency cap dropped</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David W Cerny/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58e62f28e4b05776df18b277\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-04-06T12:12:21.171Z\">1.12pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>So far with the ECB we\u2019ve had Draghi and Praet on one side and Weidmann on the other.

Trump, of course, said one of his first acts as president would be to label China a currency manipulator, but he has taken a more conciliatory tone since actually coming into power. Even so, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/05/north-korea-launches-ballistic-missile-into-sea-says-seoul\">North Korea firing another missile this week</a>, the meeting could be a tense one.</p> <p>Markets had already been unsettled by the latest minutes from the Federal Reserve. The US central bank is keen not to upset the applecart but seems to have done so anyway. To much surprise, the Fed indicated it expected to start shrinking its $4.5trn balance sheet later this year, earlier than expected. The bank has build up a portfolio of bonds and mortgage backed securities as part of its stimulus measures in the wake of the global financial crisis, and reducing those assets would be a key moment in moving back to more normal circumstances.</p> <p>Barclays analysts said:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>To our surprise, the minutes to the March meeting contained extensive discussion on balance sheet policies. We had expected this discussion to take place at the June FOMC meeting, with subsequent deliberations communicated around the timing of the annual Economic Symposium at Jackson Hole in August. However, the committee moved quicker than we anticipated, and staff weighed in with various alternative scenarios during the March meeting. The desire to signal sooner than later is likely a function of the committee\u2019s wish to avoid adverse market reactions. </p> </blockquote> <p>If that was the aim, it seems to have failed. The length of the discussion on this move and the uncertainty it casts over future interest rate rises saw Wall Street turn sharply lower after strong gains earlier on. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which at one point on Thursday was nearly 200 points higher, ended down 41 points following the minutes.<br></p> <p>Asian markets followed suit, with Japan\u2019s Nikkei falling 1.4% to a four month low. European markets are forecast to follow suit:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/IGSquawk/status/849859399812227072\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Our European opening calls:<a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24FTSE&amp;src=ctag\">$FTSE</a> 7262 down 70<br>$DAX\u00a012139 down 78<br>$CAC\u00a05059 down 33<a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24IBEX&amp;src=ctag\">$IBEX</a> 10323 down 79<a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24MIB&amp;src=ctag\">$MIB</a> 20087 down 166</p>&mdash; IGSquawk (@IGSquawk) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/IGSquawk/status/849859399812227072\">April 6, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>There were other concerns, with a disappointing Chinese service sector survey. Michael Hewson at CMC Markets said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A disappointing Caixin services PMI number from China...showed that economic activity, though positive hit its lowest level since September last year, casting doubt on the robustness of recent officials data, which panted a far rosier picture. </p> </blockquote> <p>Elsewhere, eurozone retail sales are due later, along with the weekly jobless claims from the US, while European Central Bank president Mario Draghi is due to give a speech in Frankfurt shortly.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-04-06T06:51:07.485Z\">at 7.51am BST</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "Ryanair has warned it will have to halt flights from the UK for \u201cweeks or months\u201d if Theresa May does not seal an early bilateral Brexit deal on international aviation. The suspension of flights from Stansted and other airports was \u201ca very distinct possibility\u201d, the company\u2019s chief financial officer, Neil Sorahan, told the Guardian. He added: \u201cIn the worst-case scenario there will be no flights in or out of the UK to Europe for a period, for all carriers. \u201cThere could be a situation where you\u2019re going to have get comfortable with staycations for the summer of 2019: those trips down to Portugal and Spain, unless you can swim, aren\u2019t really going to happen.\u201d Ryanair, a Dublin-based company, is legally allowed to operate out of the UK under a Europe-wide \u201copen skies\u201d regulation that allows all EU airlines and others in the \u201ccommon travel area\u201d including Morocco, Iceland, Norway and Switzerland to fly in and out of any country signed up to the pact. The open skies policy binds EU members to regulatory oversight by the European court of justice and to freedom of movement, two red lines for the UK government in Brexit talks. But Sorahan said that even if May changed her stance, Ryanair had to make contingency plans as the EU had said there could be no Brexit deal until all parts of the arrangement were agreed. \u201cEurope has been very clear in recent days that no deals are going to be put in place, they are not planning to put any special deals in place,\u201d he said. \u201cIf there was a cliff-edge scenario with World Trade Organisation rules and no bilateral on open skies in place, there is a distinct possibility that there will be no flights for a period of time between Europe and the UK. The impact on business would be disastrous.\u201d Britain is one of Ryanair\u2019s key bases with 40 of its 400 aircraft operating out of 19 UK airports including Stansted, Glasgow and Belfast. But the airline said it was considering abandoning flights between Scotland and Northern Ireland and the capital, owing to costs after Brexit. Ryanair believes it will have to set up a UK subsidiary with a British air operating licence (AOC) to continue the routes. Although Sorahan did not confirm the cost, easyJet has said its own moves to obtain an EU subsidiary and licence will cost the company \u00a310m. While easyJet would otherwise forfeit 40% of its traffic, Ryanair\u2019s UK flights were only 2% of its business, said Sorahan. \u201cThe decision may be not to go for an AOC but just abandon UK domestic flying.\u201d Like all other airlines, Ryanair schedules aircraft 12 months in advance, which means it would need to know the probable regulatory regime by next March to ensure continuity. Asked whether it was not flexible enough as a business to move planes back to the UK in the event of a last-minute deal, Sorahan said: \u201cIt would be difficult as we would have contracts with airports in Europe\u201d months before. The company said if it could not continue business in the UK during the weeks and months after Brexit in April 2019 it would pursue growth opportunities in Italy \u2013 where it said was now the number one carrier \u2013 Spain and eastern Europe. It added that it was also looking at possibilities of increasing operations in Scandinavia and Germany, where it only has 20 aircraft. Ryanair said it was talking to the Department for Transport and the Department for Exiting the European Union but that it had not been given any indication that a new open skies deal was a priority. \u201cOur message to Theresa May is: please make your mind up quickly and get a decision on an aviation deal and continue to keep Britain flying,\u201d said Sorahan. A government spokeswoman said: \u201cAviation is absolutely crucial to the UK\u2019s economy and we are committed to getting the right deal for Britain. We will work closely with the international aviation community to ensure that this global industry continues to be a major success story for the UK economy.\u201d Few airlines share Ryanair\u2019s worst fears. Pieter Elbers, the chief executive of Dutch national carrier KLM, which flies to 17 destinations in the UK from Amsterdam, with Britain representing almost a quarter of its European capacity, told the Guardian: \u201cIt\u2019s a worry. The instability and uncertainty is not good for business. However, it\u2019s premature to go into this will or won\u2019t happen.\u201d Elbers said that in the worst-case scenario of no deal, KLM would keep flying to Britain. He said: \u201cWe could still operate within that 1960s bilateral agreement\u201d which established mutual flying rights between the Netherlands the UK. However, Brexit has already forced other airlines such as easyJet into moving aircraft to enable continuity of business. Sorahan said Ryanair had planned to grow by about 15% in the UK last year but had instead posted growth of about 6%. \u201cRyanair is pivoting its growth away from the UK,\u201d he told reporters at a briefing in London on Thursday. \u201cWe may see that growth slow down as we get closer to the divorce negotiations coming to an end, unless we get greater certainty as to what we actually can or cannot do within Europe.\u201d Sorahan said the airline also expected Brexit to hit growth in both the UK and the EU, as both parties have to deal with a completely new scenario, although they had not seen that come through yet. \u201cThe only positive, I suppose, for our customers, is that this will lead to lower fares, as we have to stimulate the market,\u201d he said. Ryanair meanwhile announced that customers would be able to start booking connecting flights, a first for budget carriers in Europe, starting later this month at its base in Fiumicino, Italy. It said it expected to start fully connecting flights with other long-haul carriers, such as Norwegian and Aer Lingus, later in the year. Ryanair aded that it was also in talks to start selling tickets for other airlines worldwide, as part of a digital ambition to become what it described as an \u201cAmazon of travel\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "The maker of Flora and Stork has put the margarine and spreads business up for sale as consumers turn to butter and healthier options. Unilever, an Anglo-Dutch business which is one of the biggest consumer goods groups in the world, said it plans to sell its spreads business, which is valued at around \u00a36bn, or spin it off into a separate company. Sales of margarine and spreads, once regarded as a healthier alternative to butter, have been in long-term decline in Europe and the US. Concerns about trans fats in the 2000s led to many brands removing hydrogenated fats from their spreads and reformulating their recipes. However, sales have continued to fall. Growing suspicion of processed foods and a re-evaluation of saturated fat have prompted many consumers to return to butter. Households have also cut back on the amount of bread they eat and are buying more butter because they consider it to be more natural. Sales of margarine in the UK are down more than 12% on last year while butter sales have climbed nearly 2%, according to figures from research group Kantar Worldpanel. George Salmon, analyst at City firm Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \u201cThe reality of 21st-century life is that people are more likely to grab breakfast on the go rather than sit around the table with a few slices of toast.\u201d Tom Berry at consumer research group GlobalData added: \u201c A turnaround in expert advice on dairy fats has resulted in the resurging popularity of \u2018real\u2019 butter. The growth in home baking and the narrowing price gap between butter and margarine have further contributed to falling sales for the latter.\u201d Margarine has been central to the Unilever business since the company was formed in 1929 by the merger of Lever Brothers, which was making soap from its factory in Port Sunlight, Merseyside, and Margarine Unie, a collection of margarine makers across Europe. Margarine was invented in France in 1869 after Napoleon III offered a reward to anyone who could produce a cheaper and longer-lasting alternative to butter. Hippolyte M\u00e8ge-Mouri\u00e8s, a chemist, created margarine and eventually sold his product to Jurgens, a Dutch company that went on to become part of Margarine Unie and then Unilever. The firm\u2019s Stork brand was launched in 1920 and was the subject of famous 1970s and 1980s advertising campaigns, with comedians Sir Bruce Forsyth and Leslie Crowther, the latter fronting TV taste tests in supermarkets. Flora was launched in 1964, and marketed as being healthier than both margarine and butter, while I Can\u2019t Believe It\u2019s Not Butter! \u2013 a lower cost spread that claimed to taste more like the real thing \u2013 first went on sale in the US in 1986. However, demand for margarine and spreads has been on the slide in recent years. Annual UK sales have dropped by more than a third over the past five years, from \u00a3605m to an estimated \u00a3399m in 2016. At the same time butter sales have gone up from \u00a3666m to \u00a3706m, research from Mintel shows. Paul Polman, chief executive of Unilever, said on Thursday: \u201cAfter a long history in Unilever, we have decided that the future of the spreads business now lies outside the group.\u201d Polman announced the move as part of a shakeup of Unilever after it fought off a $143bn (\u00a3115bn) takeover bid from US rival Kraft Heinz. As well as owning the collection of margarine brands, Unilever products include Dove soap, Ben &amp; Jerry\u2019s ice-cream, Persil laundry detergent and Marmite. Unilever also announced it would spend \u20ac5bn (\u00a34.3bn) on buying back its own shares \u2013 which should push the price of the shares up \u2013 and would increase its dividend payout to shareholders by12% this year. The company is also also planning to cut costs, which will result in management job losses, and said it would review its dual legal structure in the UK and the Netherlands. This review, which will be conducted with Brexit as a backdrop, could lead to Unilever ditching its UK legal base, although the company said this did not mean any jobs would be affected. At the time of the Kraft Heinz bid, Polman called for more help from the government to protect \u201cnational champions\u201d such as Unilever. Companies in the Netherlands are offered more protection against hostile takeover bids because directors are required to take into account the interests of all stakeholders in the business, not just shareholders. Neil Wilson, a senior market analyst at ETX Capital, said: \u201cThe Kraft Heinz bid was a massive wake-up call. Unilever realised it needed to do more for shareholders but it also has to improve margins \u2013 the appeal of Kraft\u2019s bid was being able to squeeze far higher margins out of the business \u2013 bribes alone won\u2019t work.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Doritos, Peperami and Coco Pops are the latest products to fall victim to shrinkflation as rising costs hit food producers. The size of a large bag of Doritos has been reduced by 10% to 180g but remains on sale at the same average price of \u00a31.99. A \u00a31 \u201cgrab bag\u201d is shrinking by nearly 12% to 90g. Peperami has also shrunk by 10% to 22.5g while prices have remained steady at 79p a stick, or \u00a31.59 for a pack of three. The price of the sausage sticks\u2019 main ingredient, pork, hit a two-year high late last year amid high demand from China, while the fall in the pound has increased the cost of importing meat. At the same time a big box of Coco Pops has been cut by 80g to 720g, but is selling for the same price of \u00a33.75, and a smaller box has been reduced by 40g to 510g for the same price of \u00a32.69. Kellogg\u2019s said the weight had dropped because it had cut the amount of sugar in its recipe. It said the number of Coco Pops in a box had actually increased by more than 10%. According to the Grocer trade journal, which first reported the weight change, the smaller box (reduced by 40g to 510g) now contains about 16,500 Coco Pops compared to about 14,500 previously, . A spokesperson for Kellogg\u2019s, the owner of Coco Pops, said: \u201cWe recently reduced sugar in Coco Pops Original by 14%, which has reduced the weight of some packs. \u201cBy removing some of the sugar in the recipe and changing the coating, each Coco Pop weighs less than the previous recipe.\u201d The company, which has also cut the amount of sugar in Bran Flakes and Frosties, said it was doing so in response to demand from customers. In the case of Bran Flakes the pack weight didn\u2019t change when the sugar was reduced, Kellogg\u2019s said. Lianne van den Bos, senior food analyst at Euromonitor International, said: \u201cMany manufacturers will say that they are shrinking the size of their products as part of their responsibility to consumers with regards to health. But while this sounds honourable, the bottom line is the main motivation for shrinkflation.\u201d The latest round of shrinkflation \u2013 as the downsizing of favourite foods while holding the price has become known \u2013 follows similar moves by Maltesers, Hula Hoops and Toblerone. The falling value of the pound since the Brexit vote has added to problems caused by the rising price of some commodities, such as butter and wheat. Last week crisps and bacon were named as two of the products driving a sharp pick-up in food price inflation to 2.3% in the last three months, according to market research firm Kantar Worldpanel. A spokesperson for Peperami said: \u201cPeperami is manufactured in mainland Europe and has been subject to rising commodity costs and foreign exchange pressure due to significant currency fluctuations. We always endeavour to reduce the impact of such movements to ensure our brands are as affordable as possible for our loyal consumers.\u201d A spokesperson for Doritos owner PepsiCo said: \u201cLike most businesses, we are facing factors such as fluctuating foreign exchange rates which are impacting the cost of ingredients and materials. \u201cAs a result we\u2019ve had to make a few changes to certain Doritos packs. We always strive to provide high quality, competitively priced products and will continue to review our range to ensure we offer great value to our customers.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 6 April 2017. An earlier version said incorrectly that it is the large box that now has 16,500 Coco Pops in it.",
