      "bodyText": "So to recap, Greece has put forward a plan of reforms, spending cuts and tax rises that is close to what was demanded by its creditors before Alexis Tsipras called last Sunday\u2019s referendum. The plan includes sweeping chnages to VAT to raise a full 1 percent of GDP, moving more items to the 23% top rate of tax, including restaurants - a key battleground before. Greece has also dropped its opposition to abolishing the lower VAT rate on its islands, starting with the most popular tourist attractions, despite firm opposition from Tsipras\u2019s coalition partner. Athens also appears to have made significant concessions on pensions, agreeing to phase out solidarity payments for the poorest pensioners by December 2019, a year earlier than planned. It would also raise the retirement age to 67 by 2022. And it has agreed to only raise corporation tax to 28%, as the IMF wanted, not 29% as previously targeted. Greece is also proposing to cut military spending by \u20ac100m in 2015 and by \u20ac200m in 2016, and implement changes to reform and improve tax collection and fight tax evasion. It will also press on with privatisation of state assets including regional airports and ports; some government MPs had vowed to reverse this. In return, Greece appears to be seeking a three-year loan deal worth \u20ac53.5bn. Two obvious questions -- will this still be enough for creditors, or will they push for even tougher \u201cconditionality\u201d now we\u2019re talking about a new bailout programme. And how will Alexis Tsipras persuade his party, including the hardline Radical Left, to support it? We may find out both questions on Friday, so tune in then. Goodnight! GW The Greek proposal doesn\u2019t appear to cover debt relief. But apparently, Athens has also released one of its \u2018non-papers\u2019 to the media, explaining that they are also seeking \u201cregulation\u2019 of debt\u201d and the \u20ac35bn investment package promised by Jean-Claude Juncker. A round of applause for Greek newspaper Naftemporiki, who has uploaded the full proposal: The Greek reform proposals It does appear that Greece has, errr, compromised rather substantially: Hot out of Brussels, the Greek proposal is starting to leak. And it shows that Greece is promising to hit the surplus targets demanded by its creditors, after months of resistance And here\u2019s how they\u2019ll do it: And finally (probably), the first reactions are already coming in from outraged leftists following news of the new measures, says Helena. The communist party has called on supporters to attend a mass rally in Omonia Square at 7pm (5pm BST) on Friday to protest \u201cthe barbaric memorandum.\u201d \u201cFight now to cancel the plans to pauperise the people,\u201d it declared in a statement released in the last five minutes. \u201cLet\u2019s say NO to the barbaric memorandum.\u201d Time to dig out the OXI signs again? Panic over! A signed copy of the Greek proposal has landed in Brussels. So what happens now? Over to Athens..... Our correspondent Helena Smith has confirmed that the proposed reforms have indeed been sent to the country\u2019s creditors - and three hours AHEAD of the midnight deadline central European time. Government insiders are saying the proposals were sent at 1OPM Greek time (9 PM central European time) to all three creditors and the president of the Euro Group of euro area finance ministers Jeroen Dijsselbloem. The Dutch finance minister must sign off on the reforms before they are submitted for further discussion to EU leaders. The proposed package - a biting mix of tax hikes and swingeing cutbacks - was tabled in parliament as an emergency bill on Thursday. It will, say officials, be put to vote on Friday evening in order to invest the Greek prime minister, his deputy Yannis Dragasakis and finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos with the appropriate authority to conduct talks around the proposed reforms. Until a cast-iron agreement is reached, the vote will not be binding - rather is is aimed exclusively at furnishing the central protagonists in Greece\u2019s negotiating team with the authority to debate with creditors around the proposed reforms. Once negotiations are completed it will become law. After several drama-filled days, replete with apocalyptic scenarios, a ray of hope was seen tonight. The vast majority in Tsipras\u2019 radical left Syriza party accept that chaos lies the other way. But the devil will be in the detail. Panagiotis Lafazanis, who heads Syriza\u2019s militant wing, the Left Platform, has already expressed his wholehearted opposition to the proposed plan saying it fails to give any hope of a breakthrough to the Greek economic crisis. The Left Platform represents about a third of the party. Zoe Konstantopoulou, the president of the parliament and a member of Syriza\u2019s hard left herself, has publicly announced that no new memorandum outlining further austerity will be passed by the 300 seat House. Although, Konstantopoulou has just spent 3.5 hours with Tsipras.... and has left his office refusing to make any comment! Ah, there may be a hitch... Eurogroup president Dijsselbloem\u2019s spokesman has confirmed that the Greek bailout plan has arrived! Sounds like the Greek proposal has been fired across to Brussels; if so, that\u2019s AHEAD of the midnight deadline. Here\u2019s our latest news story about tonight\u2019s developments: Greece debt crisis: Athens accepts harsh austerity as bailout deal nears The Greek government capitulated on Thursday to demands from its creditors for severe austerity measures in return for a modest debt write-off, raising hopes that a rescue deal could be signed at an emergency meeting of EU leaders on Sunday. Athens is understood to have put forward a package of reforms and public spending cuts worth \u20ac13bn (\u00a39.3bn) to secure a third bailout from creditors that could raise $50bn and allow it to stay inside the currency union. A cabinet meeting signed off the reform package after ministers agreed that the dire state of the economy and the debilitating closure of the country\u2019s banks meant it had no option but to agree to almost all the creditors terms. Parliament is expected to endorse the package after a frantic few days of negotiation that followed a landmark referendum last Sunday in which Greek voters backed the radical leftist Syriza government\u2019s call for debt relief. Syriza, which is in coalition with the rightwing populist Independent party, is expected to meet huge opposition from within its own ranks and from trade unions and youth groups that viewed the referendum as a vote against any austerity. More here: A group of pro-EU demonstrators have gathered outside the Greek parliament tonight: Friday will be busy.... International observers have been telling us today that the package is likely to be so punitive that humanitarian aid cannot be ruled out. EU president Jean Claude Juncker had mentioned humanitarian aid as part of the \u201cdetailed Grexit scenario\u201d plans creditors had drawn up. EU diplomats based in Athens said some form of assistance is likely to be given even if am agreement between Greece its creditors is reached. Syriza MPs have been telling our Helena Smith that the big no received in the referendum on Sunday was a \u201cconfidence vote\u201d in Tsipras who like no other prime minister before now has the popular support to enforce such punitive measures. That is not how the far far left (or indeed the far left in Syriza) see things. Strikes, rallies and protests should be expected in weeks ahead. We don\u2019t yet know the details of Greece\u2019s plan, but one report says there will be \u20ac13bn of fresh austerity. A heavy blow for the economy after years of recession, and the current banking shutdown. The irony has not been lost on anyone - even though governing MPs are making light of it - that after the Greeks\u2019 resounding rejection of further biting austerity at the weekend, prime minister Alexis Tsipras has with lightning speed now agreed to put his name to the most punitive austerity package any government has been asked to implement during the five years of economic crisis in Greece. Breaking news in Athens. In an emergency meeting the Greek government has approved the package of measures it will present to creditors (hopefully later this evening) to break the impasse and reach an agreement, our correspondent Helena Smith reports. A senior Syriza MP has just told me that the radical left party\u2019s parliamentary group has been \u201casked to be on standby\u201d to vote on the package possibly as early as tomorrow. \u201cWe have all been told to be here. We may have to vote on it tomorrow,\u201d he said. The defence minister who leads the right-wing populist Independent Greeks party, the government\u2019s junior partner, has also just said: \u201cVery shortly the Greek proposal will be tabled.\u201d Time for a recap The Greek government is furiously scrambling to draw up a credible package of economic reforms to deliver to its creditors before midnight tonight, ahead of Sunday meetings that will decide its future in the eurozone. French officials are providing \u201cinvaluable support\u201d to Greece, we hear. Greek media claim that the plan could include up to \u20ac12bn of tax rises and spending cuts, more than expected. One Syriza MP has told us that he\u2019s optimistic about a deal for the first time in weeks. And Ireland\u2019s Michael Noonan has suggested there\u2019s a better than 50% chance of a deal. But there are also signs of tension in the Greek coalition. Panagiotis Lafazanis, the energy minister and influential hard-leftist, has ruled out a new tough austerity package. And Mario Draghi, the ECB chief, has warned that reaching a Greek deal is \u201creally difficult\u201d this time. European Council president Donald Tusk has thrown his weight behind calls for Greece to be given the debt relief which the IMF says is essential. Tusk said that if Greece provides a realistic proposal, then \u201cit will need to be matched by an equally realistic proposal on debt sustainability by the creditors\u201d. Tusk tweeted his message too: And threw in a bit of Latin: That\u2019s \u201cThrift is a great revenue\u201d, \u2018pparently. Tusk\u2019s comments pile more pressure on eurozone hard-liners to face up to Greece\u2019s need for debt relief. But Germany\u2019s chancellor Angela Merkel has warned that Greece cannot receive a \u2018classic haircut\u2019 on its loans. And finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, has echoed this point, telling an audience in Frankfurt that: \u201cDebt sustainability is not feasible without a haircut and I think the IMF is correct in saying that.... There cannot be a haircut because it would infringe the system of the European Union.\u201d Sch\u00e4uble has also pushed back at US interference: Europe\u2019s stock markets have jumped by 2% today, partly on hopes of a Greek resolution soon. As analysts at City firm Jefferies explain: By Monday morning, hopefully, it should be pretty clear whether or not Greece is staying in the euro area \u2013 at least for the next few months. It seems very unlikely that over the next 72 hours the two sides will bridge the gap between Tsipras\u2019 desire for a debt write-down and the Europeans\u2019 reluctance to offer anything up-front without Greece actually implementing (as opposed to promising to implement) reforms. So a long-term deal seems illusive, but a short-term bridging loan allowing Greece to pay the IMF and, most importantly, the ECB on 20 July (the following Monday), could be on offer. And the weekend is going to be busy, with eurozone finance ministers meeting on Saturday: Followed by leaders on Sunday: European commission vice-president Valdis Dombrovskis has confirmed that Greece\u2019s lenders are working on a debt sustainability analysis, ready for the weekend. In Spain, a video is doing the rounds shows Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras -- whether intentionally or not -- snubbing his Spanish anti-austerity ally, Podemos\u2019 Pablo Iglesias. The video, shot as Tsipras visited the European parliament on Wednesday, shows the Syriza leader greeting politicians. As Iglesias puts his hand on Tsipras\u2019 shoulder and holds out his other hand, Tsipras instead turns to French MEP Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon. Thousands have shared the video on social media, asking whether the gesture was intentional or simply an oversight by Tsipras. On Monday, Iglesias welcomed the results of the Greek referendum, but sought to dampen any speculation that Spain would follow in the footsteps of Greece. \u201cWe have a great friendship with Syriza, but luckily, Spain is not Greece,\u201d Iglesias told local media. \u201cThe circumstances are different and it makes no sense to draw parallels.\u201d Mr Sch\u00e4uble is in a witty moody today.... Don\u2019t take the offer, Jack - the Puerto Rico default is bad, but not as bad as Greece. Woah! Back in Frankfurt, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble has said the IMF is correct that Greece needs a haircut make its debt sustainable; but alas this isn\u2019t possible under European rules. Sch\u00e4uble also played down the significance of \u2018reprofiling\u2019 Greece\u2019s debt mountain (eg, by extending maturities) Spotted: Greece\u2019s new finance minister, Euclid Tsakalotos, chatting with his predecessor Yanis Varoufakis in the Athens parliament today. French finance minister Michel Sapin has also weighed in on the Greek crisis. Reuters has the details: \u201cBalanced budgetary strategies are necessary and efforts are needed to boost investment,\u201d Sapin told a conference in Frankfurt. \u201cWe must find the right balance between indispensable budgetary consideration and boosting growth.\u201d Regarding Greece, Sapin said there was a need to rebuild confidence and trust to find a solution to the current crisis Over in Frankfurt, German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble called for the eurozone to be strengthened to avoid a repeat of the Greek crisis. Sch\u00e4uble warned: \u201cA monetary union constructed like ours is nothing but an invitation for somebody that doesn\u2019t stick to the rules and that\u2019s called moral hazard.\u201d Sch\u00e4uble added that Greece can\u2019t expect any help until it\u2019s taken \u2018prior actions\u2019, and there\u2019s no sign of that yet. Hopefully Greece\u2019s new proposal, due by midnight, will illuminate that point. For all its concern about Greece\u2019s debt sustainability, the IMF isn\u2019t planning to offer any relief itself. Olivier Blanchard, its outgoing chief economist, has pointed out that poorer countries (Fund members themselves) haven\u2019t received the kind of treatment Athens is seeking: Gloomy news from the IMF: They\u2019ve just cut their global growth forecasts. They now expect world GDP to rise by 3.3% this year, down from 3.5% back in April. For once, the eurozone doesn\u2019t get the blame -- instead, the Fund has slashed its growth forecasts for the US and Canada, and also predicted slower growth in Japan and the UK. Angela Merkel has ruled out slashing the face value of Greece\u2019s government debt, during a visit to Bosnia today. Reuters has the details: \u201cIn 2012 we dealt with the issue of debt sustainability. We stretched out the maturities, we pushed back the repayment requirement for EFSF loans out to 2020. So we are not dealing with debt sustainability for the first time,\u201d Merkel said when asked about differences with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) over a debt writedown for Greece. \u201cI have said that a classic haircut is out of the question for me and that hasn\u2019t changed between yesterday and today.\u201d That is likely to play well back home. But it also doesn\u2019t rule out a \u2018reprofiling\u2019 of Greek debt -- ie, cutting the (already low) interest rates or giving Athens more time to pay its borrowings back. That could make the debt more sustainable. Speaking of haircuts..... Europe allowed the negotiations with Greece to drag on too long, says European Council president Donald Tusk in an interview published today. Tusk told Dutch newspaper NRC Handelsblad that tougher limits should have been drawn from the beginning of negotiations, after Syriza won January\u2019s general election. Instead, the two sides talked for months, meaning Greece\u2019s second bailout expired on 30 June before a deal was reached. Tusk also warned that last weekend\u2019s referendum makes it harder to reach a deal, as Tsipras will have to make proposals which go against the \u201cNo\u201d result to get a new aid package. Thanks Henk! Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, explains why European markets are rallying: Reports have circulated this morning that the latest Greek plan could contain \u20ac12 billion in tax rises and cuts. Whilst this will be music to creditors\u2019 ears, or it will if relationships haven\u2019t been soured too much, this level of reform is more than the amount the Greek public rejected by voting \u2018no\u2019 in last weekend\u2019s referendum. Tsipras remains stuck between the creditor rock and the Syriza/Greek public hard place, and if the \u20ac12 billion reform plan reports are true it\u2019s going to be a tough sell back at home, to put it mildly. Things might be eased, however, if the growing calls for debt relief are heard by those (Germany) who are so opposed to them. Donald Tusk joined Christine Lagarde and Jack Lew in stating that negotiations do not go one way, and that if Greece\u2019s proposal is sufficient it has to be matched by an \u2018equally realistic\u2019 proposal by the creditor cabal on debt sustainability. Rumours of a French helping hand in drawing up these proposals also suggest that the Eurozone, or at least certain members of the region, remain committed to avoiding a Grexit, with Irish finance minister claiming that there is more than a 50% chance of a deal being made. European stock markets are pushing higher, following Donald Tusk\u2019s warning to creditors that they must consider Greek debt sustainability. The main indices are up over 2%, on hopes that a deal could come by Sunday. Who voted No last Sunday? The Greek poor. And who voted yes? The wealthy. And here\u2019s the proof, from my colleagues Achilleas Galatsidas and George Arnett. They\u2019ve taken the voting data from last weekend\u2019s referendum, and mapped it against average income levels across Athens. They report: Wealthy suburbs in the north such as Kifisia voted definitively in favour of a deal with Greece\u2019s creditors. However, in some of the lower-income districts, particularly in the west of the city, the no vote was backed by the vast majority of residents. Bad news for eurozone crisis watchers who fancied a quiet weekend - eurozone finance ministers will meet at 2pm BST (4pm Athens time) on Saturday to discuss Greece\u2019s proposals (once they\u2019re written): Political developments in Athens.... Donald Tusk\u2019s comments on debt sustainability could be an important development, following a double-whammy of pressure from America last night. Yesterday, International Monetary Fund MD Christine Lagarde warned that Greece is now in \u201ca situation of acute crisis\u201d; reforms and a \u201cdebt restructuring\u201d are both needed to escape it. And US Treasury secretary Jack Lew made his clearest signal yet that America believes restructuring is inevitable. He said: \u201cIn the next few days what we\u2019ll see is [whether] the parties come together and build enough trust that Greece will take the actions that it needs to take so that Europe will restructure the debt in a way that is more sustainable\u201d The IMF had already made his point a week ago; its new Debt Sustainability Analysis showed that Greece needs \u201ccomprehensive\u201d debt relief, with repayments delayed for decade. The eurozone has been trying to kick this issue under the carpet for months. Tusk\u2019s comments suggest that the message has got home to Europe; helpful for the Greek government, but problematic for the likes of Germany. The EU has just announced the timings for Sunday\u2019s leaders\u2019 meetings on Greece: Tusk has also tweeted that Greece\u2019s creditors must show how they would help Greece bring its debt pile down to a sustainable level: While I was watching Donald Tusk, the European Commission was giving its morning briefing. And it emerged that president Juncker will meet Greek opposition parties today: There are murmurings from Athens that opposition parties fear that Alexis Tsipras is either unable or unwilling to reach an agreement. Kathimerini explains: New Democracy leader Evangelos Meimarakis met with Tsipras and four other party leaders on Monday, resulting in the issuing of a joint statement. However, the conservative said on Wednesday that he refused to hold another meeting in private with Tsipras and called on him to address Parliament. Meimarakis said that he wanted Tsipras\u2019s comments to be officially recorded, which suggests that the New Democracy chief has become suspicious of the prime minister\u2019s motives. Meimarakis also decided to send ex-ministers Dora Bakoyannis and Costis Hatzidakis to Brussels for discussions with officials there. Former PASOK leader Evangelos Venizelos suggested that Tsipras is trying to trap the opposition parties so he can call snap elections without reaching any agreement with the institutions. Luxembourg\u2019s PM, Xavier Bettel, says that he will speak with Tsipras later today to push him to deliver \u2018serious\u2019 proposals. Standing alongside Donald Tusk, Bettel also signals that patience is stretched: We have had months of goodwill. we now need proposals. Donald Tusk, EC president, says we have just three days to tackle the Greek crisis. Speaking in Luxembourg, Tusk says that Greece remains the most pressing issue for Europe. We stand ready to do whatever is necessary to protect the stability of the euro area. I spoke with prime minister Alexis Tsipras today, says Tusk. And I hope that today we will receive concrete and realistic proposals from Athens. And if that happens, we will also need parallel proposal from the creditors. If Greece provides a realistic proposal, then \u201cit will need to be matched by an equally realistic proposal on debt sustainability by the creditors\u201d. Only then will we have a win-win situation. Otherwise we will continue the lethargic dance that we have been dancing for the last five months. Donald Tusk, president of the European Council is giving a press conference with Luxembourg\u2019s prime minister Xavier Bettel now, and discussing Greece. It\u2019s being streamed live here. Francesco Papadia, former director general for market operations at the European Central Bank, has put his finger on the political challenges ahead: Ireland\u2019s finance minister, Michael Noonan, has an Irish radio that he believes Alexis Tsipras will manage to reach a deal to keep Greece in the eurozone. The odds, he says, are over 50%. I\u2019m trying to get hold of the quotes - in the meantime, Twitter has the top lines: Noonan was also complimentary about Greece\u2019s new finance minister, Euclid Tsakalotos, calling him \u201cvery impressive\u201d (among other things...): There\u2019s no escape from deflation in Greece. Consumer prices fell by 2.2% annually in June, down from a 2.1% drop in May. This month\u2019s figures will surely be even worse, given the imposition of capital controls at the end of June. Greece\u2019s jobless rate has dipped, but is still at depression-era levels. The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate in April 2015 was 25.6%, according to Elstat, down from 25.8% in March 2015. Europe\u2019s stock markets are rallying this morning, partly due to hopes that the Greek government will meet tonight\u2019s deadline. The French CAC and German DAX are both up over 1%. Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, says: Optimism is rising that Greece will deliver on promised proposals, both on time (today) and extensive enough (\u20ac12bn of reforms?), to allow creditors sign off on a third bailout for the beleaguered nation rather than its exit from the single currency. Traders are also reacting to the latest twists in China - shares have soared today, after days of panic plunges prompted a ban on some shares sales. Alexis Tsipras is now meeting with his top cabinet ministers to discuss the reform plans, according to local media Hold the optimism. Greece\u2019s energy minister, the influential left-wing Panagiotis Lafazanis, has said today that he expects a deal soon - but won\u2019t accept a new bailout programme with tough austerity. A MoU, or Memorandum of Understanding, is a list of measure Greece must take in return for aid. And any third bailout would certainly include one. Lafazanis represents the radical far-left wing of the Syriza coalition, an important bloc of Tsipras\u2019s government. Analysts have speculated that the Left Platform could potentially break away, rather than sign up to a new austerity package. Greek media are also reporting that Greece\u2019s reform plan could include \u20ac12bn of cuts and tax rises -- several billion euros than previously expected. And that\u2019s because of the deterioration in the Greek economy, which plunged back into recession this year. Enikos has the details says: The report said that instead of growing by 0.5 percent this year, months of uncertainty and almost two weeks of capital controls meant \u201cthere are estimates of a recession of about 3 percent.\u201d \u201cIt is estimated that the measures of 8 billion euros that Greece had presented for 2015 and 2016 will have to be increased by 2 billion euros per year, raising the total to 12 billion euros for the two years,\u201d Kathimerini reported. That\u2019s French PM Manuel Valls, who insisted yesterday that Greece must not leave the eurozone. Over in Athens insiders are saying that French help in drawing up the country\u2019s new reform proposal is proving invaluable. Our correspondent Helena Smith reports. Officials here are saying that all hope now rests with the French connection. Paris has dispatched a team of technocrats to help finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos draft the new proposal in an effort to ensure it is as convincing as can possibly be. One insider says: \u201cIt is being done all over again, measure by measure. They are offering invaluable assistance.\u201d Tsakalotos, who returned to Athens last night, will convene with prime minister Alexis Tsipras and other senior officials to discuss the new measures \u2013 a mix of biting taxes, swingeing cuts and administrative reforms. At this point in time, the third bailout will allegedly be in the range of \u20ac52bn with Greece asking for the emergency aid to be disbursed over three years. The media here is also reporting that the IMF is pressing for the package to be higher, in the range of \u20ac60-\u20ac70bn. Events have happened so fast, that Greeks have almost not had the opportunity to digest the news that after nearly six months of drama-filled negotiations they could soon be hit with a heavier austerity package than at any other time. But for the first time in several days there is hope that a way can be found out. I spoke with Greece\u2019s pre-eminent sociologist, professor Konstantinos Tsoukalas, who also sits as a state MP with the governing Syriza party this morning, and he said: \u201cI am very optimistic for the first time in days.\u201d Greek pensioners have been queuing at bank branches today, to receive the maximum \u20ac120 they are entitled to under capital controls. There\u2019s no hope of buying or selling shares in Greek companies this week; it\u2019s just been announced that the stock market will remain closed until at least Monday night. Mario Draghi, one of the crucial players in this drama, has warned that resolving the Greece crisis will be very tough. That\u2019s according to Italian financial daily Il Sole 24 Ore today. It reports that Draghi was asked about the prospect of a Greek deal when on a flight from Brussels to Rome yesterday, and replied: \u201cI don\u2019t know, this time it\u2019s really difficult.\u201d Draghi also downplayed the prospect of Russian President Vladimir Putin stepping in, saying: \u201cI don\u2019t see it as a real risk ... and then, they don\u2019t have money themselves.\u201d (thanks to Reuters for the translation) Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the Greek debt crisis. \u201cI love deadlines. I love the whooshing noise they make as they go by.\u201d With that attitude, Douglas Adams would certainly have enjoyed the eurozone crisis. But Greece now faces one of those deadlines that one really can\u2019t miss. Alexis Tsipras\u2019s government must draw up and deliver a credible economic plan to its creditors by the end of the day, to have any chance of securing the third bailout plan it requested on Wednesday. Tsipras, back in Athens after his bruising trip to the European Parliament, will meet with his cabinet today to discuss the details. That could be a tense affair; sections of his Syriza party will surely battle against the imposition of fresh austerity measures, especially after last Sunday\u2019s referendum. But if the cabinet can stay united, finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos will draw up the details and send them winging to creditors. Germany expects them by midnight Thursday (although EC president Jean-Claude Juncker has suggested the finally final deadline is 8.30am Friday morning #whoosh). The pressure on both sides to reach a deal is hitting new heights. Yesterday, the IMF and the US Treasury urged Athens and its lenders to reach a deal, and warned that Greece must be given debt relief. Government spokesman Gabriel Sakellaridis has already been on TV today to insist that agreement can be reached. Sakellaridis told Antenna TV this morning that: \u201cI am certain the agreement will pass Syriza\u2019s parliamentary group, [and] the governing coalition. The government is doing everything it can to reach an immediate deal and end this cycle of uncertainty.\u201d That certainty will be tested today, as we rattle towards a weekend of drama that could surpass anything seen in the last five years of the eurozone crisis. If an acceptable plan isn\u2019t drawn up in time, Sunday\u2019s EU leaders summit will be about handling the fallout of Greece\u2019s departure from the eurozone. We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events though the day....",

It would also raise the retirement age to 67 by 2022. </p> <p>And it has agreed to only raise corporation tax to 28%, as the IMF wanted, not 29% as previously targeted.</p> <p>Greece is also proposing to cut military spending by \u20ac100m in 2015 and by \u20ac200m in 2016, and implement changes to reform and improve tax collection and fight tax evasion. It will also press on with privatisation of state assets including regional airports and ports; some government MPs had vowed to reverse this.</p> <p><strong>In return, Greece appears to be seeking a three-year loan deal worth \u20ac53.5bn.</strong></p> <p>Two obvious questions -- will this still be enough for creditors, or will they push for even tougher \u201cconditionality\u201d now we\u2019re talking about a new bailout programme. And how will Alexis Tsipras persuade his party, including the hardline Radical Left, to support it?</p> <p>We may find out both questions on Friday, so tune in then.

      "bodyText": "The new chairman of Barclays has told top staff he intends to double the bank\u2019s share price in three years as he slashes costs and reinvigorates the organisation. John McFarlane set out his ambitions for the bank in a meeting with top managers on Wednesday, just hours after the City was informed that Antony Jenkins had been ousted as chief executive. The bank\u2019s share price, at around 260p, is at a similiar level to six years ago and McFarlane is keen to bolster returns to shareholders after a period dogged with rows over bonuses and multimillion-pound fines from regulators around the world. His remarks to managers were described as aspirational goals rather than formal targets, and Barclays declined to comment on them. McFarlane\u2019s goal to accelerate growth at Barclays follows a period when Jenkins had been scaling back its investment bank \u2013 the source of the fines and bonus controversy. McFarlane told the Financial Times on Thursday that he thought the bank could be more aggressive in lending on credit cards and mortgages, and accelerate growth in its African business. There is also a new plan for the investment bank, once the powerhouse of the business. McFarlane will become executive chairman of Barclays next week following the ousting of Jenkins, who was promoted to chief executive three years ago in the wake of the Libor-rigging scandal. McFarlane, who only joined three months ago, said that Jenkins was fired after \u201crumblings\u201d from non-executive directors. It is not the first time McFarlane has been installed as an executive chairman \u2013 a role usually frowned upon by investors and City regulators, who prefer the roles of chairman and chief executive to be kept separate. In 2012, he was named as executive chairman of insurance company Aviva after its chief executive, Andrew Moss, was ousted during the so-called \u201cshareholder spring\u201d, in which sizeable numbers of investors rebelled against boardroom pay in that year\u2019s round of annual meetings. He has also boasted about his impact on the share price during his time at Aviva. When asked on Wednesday about his reputation as a ruthless cost-cutter, he referred to his period at Aviva: \u201cTripling the market cap ... isn\u2019t about knives, it\u2019s about accelerating.\u201d",

When asked on Wednesday <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/08/john-mcfarlane-barclays-reputation-antony-jenkins\">about his reputation as a ruthless cost-cutter</a>, he referred to his period at Aviva: \u201cTripling the market cap ... isn\u2019t about knives, it\u2019s about accelerating.\u201d</p>",

It is now to be halved and applied only to each bank\u2019s UK operations. The changes will also mean that bailed-out banks Lloyds Banking Group and Royal Bank of Scotland pay more. The new challenger banks \u2013which the chancellor is keen to encourage to boost competition \u2013 including Virgin Money will also take the hit. Gary Greenwood, an analyst at Shore Capital, calculated that the changes announced by the chancellor on Wednesday would result in HSBC paying \u00a3300m to the exchequer \u2013 down from \u00a31bn under the old system. Standard Chartered would pay almost nothing \u2013 down from \u00a3350m. Greenwood\u2019s analysis \u2013 a snapshot of what the impact of the changes would be if they had all come into place immediately \u2013 shows that the bailed-out banks RBS and Lloyds would pay about \u00a3100m and \u00a3300m more, respectively. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), an independent thinktank, said the changes to the bank levy \u2013 which will cost the exchequer \u00a31.8bn a year from 2021-22 \u2013 \u201cwas a significant giveaway, a large slice to HSBC\u201d. Greenwood assumes all the changes come into place at once in an effort to gauge their eventual impact on individual banks, although the measures are being phased in over the next six years. By 2020-2021, the bank levywill be halved in value and based only on the UK portion of a balance sheets. The 8% surcharge on banks\u2019 UK profits comes in from the start of next year while by 2020-21 the overall level of corporation tax will be cut to 18%. This implies the banking sector will then be paying a corporation tax rate of 26%. Analysts at US investment bank Morgan Stanley also concluded that of the major banks, Lloyds would suffer most, with a 7% hit to profits in 2017 and 4% in the longer term. For HSBC there is no immediate impact but in the longer term it will see a 6% improvement. For Standard Chartered, there is a 15% boost. The analysts also warned that the 8% surcharge could result in increased costs of borrowing for households and businesses. \u201cIt\u2019s worth bearing in mind that over time, this impact may be mitigated by repricing of domestic loans, given all bank profits will be subject to the same surcharge,\u201d Morgan Stanley analysts said. The Treasury declined to comment on Thursday. Osborne told MPs during his budget speech that by making the changes \u201cwe\u2019ll actually raise more from the banks this parliament, but at the same time make our country a more competitive place to do business\u201d. The budget contained the latest in a series of tax changes on the bank sector. The IFS said: \u201cBy 2021 there will have been 13 tax rates in 10 years.\u201d It calculated the surcharge would raise \u00a31.3bn from 2016 while other tax changes mean the Treasury expects to bring in \u00a32bn.",

      "bodyText": "The Communication Workers Union has launched a campaign against what it claims are threats to working conditions and services at Royal Mail from privatisation and regulatory intervention. The union said its \u201cPeople\u2019s Post\u201d campaign was a response to the government\u2019s declared intention to sell its remaining stake in Royal Mail and the regulator Ofcom\u2019s demands for efficiency measures. If Royal Mail succumbed to pressure and tried to change workers\u2019 terms and conditions then the CWU could resort to industrial action. The last government sold 70% of Royal Mail to investors in 2013. Following the sale of another 15% last month, Chancellor George Osborne announced in the budget on Wednesday that he intended to sell the remainder by April next year. Ofcom\u2019s comments about flexibility in workforces at other European postal companies and the regulator\u2019s call for greater efficiency at Royal Mail show the regulator has working conditions in its sights, the CWU added. Both risk undermining working conditions and ultimately the universal postal service that delivers to all parts of the country for the same price, the CWU said. At a rally to launch the campaign on Friday, Dave Ward, the CWU general secretary, said: \u201cThere are a lot of pressures coming on from competition, regulation and privatisation and it is pushing Royal Mail towards a race to the bottom. \u201cThis is a defiant message. The coalition may have been successful in privatising 70% of the company and this government may have been successful in selling, overnight without any public scrutiny, half the remaining stake, but in terms of what the postal worker does and the service they provide it\u2019s still the people\u2019s post.\u201d Royal Mail and the CWU reached a five-year agreement in 2013 designed to end many years of industrial strife. The union said it would not accept attempts to change the agreed terms. Ward said the agreement was a groundbreaking deal that was working well but that it was not set in stone. There will inevitably be greater pressure on Royal Mail management and if the agreement comes under strain the CWU will fight back, he said. \u201cWe are not frightened of industrial action. We\u2019ve probably had more industrial disputes in the last 10 or 12 years than any other union. We want Royal Mail to be successful and I know Royal Mail faces some really big challenges.\u201d Ofcom has overstepped its remit and there should be an overhaul of regulation, the CWU argued. Promoting competition and cost cuts threatens Royal Mail\u2019s daily deliveries and rivals should be banned from \u201ccherry picking\u201d in the letters market, the union said. Ward argued that Ofcom had appointed itself as an arbiter of efficiency at Royal Mail when its job is to preserve the universal service. Ofcom said: \u201cOfcom\u2019s duty is to secure a universal postal service that is financially sustainable and efficient. If this is ever under threat, we have powers to step in, but questions of pay and contract terms are for the companies themselves.\u201d The decision in May of rival Whistl to stop delivering letters despite choosing the most profitable parts of the country and paying low wages showed Royal Mail was not wasteful, Ward said. He wants the CWU to recruit members at other postal companies to fight for better conditions. Royal Mail should be the industry\u2019s standard bearer for good pay and terms instead of being put under pressure to copy other companies whose workers are on insecure contracts with low pay, he added. Ward said the CWU was against the sale of the government\u2019s remaining stake but that the union\u2019s campaign was designed to last beyond full privatisation. Town hall meetings with prominent speakers will be open to the public and members will be galvanised by the union concentrating on its main job of working for them, he said.",

    "webTitle": "Primark to debut in Milan", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Primark is taking its own brand of high street chic to Milan, home to Versace, Prada and Armani and one of the world\u2019s fashion capitals. The retailer \u2013 already nicknamed Primarni by fans \u2013 plans to open three stores in Italy within the next 12 months. The move comes as Primark revealed that its first US store, in Boston\u2019s Downtown Crossing, will open in September. John Bason, finance director of Primark\u2019s parent company Associated British Foods (ABF), said Primark already had stores in Germany, the UK, France and Spain, and that Italy was the logical next step. Primark\u2019s own analysis has found Italy to be the second biggest potential market for the brand in the EU, behind only Germany. \u201cA lot of this is about the availability of stores \u2026 Italy is just a bit more difficult,\u201d said Bason. \u201cPrimark will do what it has done time and time again. We will open a few stores, let\u2019s understand the variations [in the market] and then have the confidence to accelerate.\u201d He said the Italian venture was being overseen by a completely different team within Primark to the US venture and insisted the business was not overstretching itself. Primark has lined up eight new stores in the notoriously tricky US market. Bason said the retailer had already begun shipping clothing to its new warehouse in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, in preparation for the opening. In the UK, Primark\u2019s biggest market, Bason said sales at established stores rose by between 1% and 2% in the 16 weeks to 20 June despite a cold start to the spring which has hit sales at other retailers including Marks &amp; Spencer. \u201cInstead of going backwards, we have seen the strength of Primark and it has gone ahead further,\u201d he said. The weather had undoubtedly held back performance, Bason said, but British shoppers now had more money to spare, thanks to falls in petrol and food prices, and were putting more Primark items in their baskets on each shop. Shares in ABF rose more than 5% to \u00a330.78 on Thursday as Primark\u2019s relatively strong performance in the UK, as well as in Spain, Portugal and Ireland was offset by weaker sales in Germany and the Netherlands. For the group as a whole, sales at established stores were flat year-on-year. The retailer admitted its results next year were likely to be hit by extra running costs while it moves a UK warehouse from Magna Park to Islip in Northamptonshire. It said the rising value of the dollar, which Primark uses to buy the bulk of its clothing, against the pound would also cut profit margins.

      "body": "<p>Primark is taking its own brand of high street chic to Milan, home to Versace, Prada and Armani and one of the world\u2019s fashion capitals. <br></p> <p>The retailer \u2013 already nicknamed Primarni by fans \u2013 plans to open three stores in Italy within the next 12 months. The move comes as Primark revealed that its first US store, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/apr/23/primark-retail-us-market-boston\">in Boston\u2019s Downtown Crossing</a>, will open in September.</p> <p>John Bason, finance director of Primark\u2019s parent company Associated British Foods (ABF), said Primark already had stores in Germany, the UK, France and Spain, and that Italy was the logical next step. Primark\u2019s own analysis has found Italy to be the second biggest potential market for the brand in the EU, behind only Germany.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of this is about the availability of stores \u2026 Italy is just a bit more difficult,\u201d said Bason. \u201cPrimark will do what it has done time and time again. We will open a few stores, let\u2019s understand the variations [in the market] and then have the confidence to accelerate.\u201d He said the Italian venture was being overseen by a completely different team within Primark to the US venture and insisted the business was not overstretching itself.</p> <p>Primark has lined up eight new stores in the notoriously tricky US market. Bason said the retailer had already begun shipping clothing to its new warehouse in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, in preparation for the opening.</p> <p>In the UK, Primark\u2019s biggest market, Bason said sales at established stores rose by between 1% and 2% in the 16 weeks to 20 June despite a cold start to the spring which has hit sales at other retailers including Marks &amp; Spencer.</p> <p>\u201cInstead of going backwards, we have seen the strength of Primark and it has gone ahead further,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The weather had undoubtedly held back performance, Bason said, but British shoppers now had more money to spare, thanks to falls in petrol and food prices, and were putting more Primark items in their baskets on each shop. </p> <p>Shares in ABF rose more than 5% to \u00a330.78 on Thursday as Primark\u2019s relatively strong performance in the UK, as well as in Spain, Portugal and Ireland was offset by weaker sales in Germany and the Netherlands. For the group as a whole, sales at established stores were flat year-on-year. </p> <p>The retailer admitted its results next year were likely to be hit by extra running costs while it moves a UK warehouse from Magna Park to Islip in Northamptonshire. It said the rising value of the dollar, which Primark uses to buy the bulk of its clothing, against the pound would also cut profit margins. </p> <p>City analysts welcomed the company\u2019s reassurance that a good proportion of the impact of the strong dollar had been successfully mitigated by Primark\u2019s buying teams in the terms agreed on new orders. </p> <p>There was also good news from ABF\u2019s food brands business, which has won back orders from Tesco for its 50/50 Kingsmill bread, after the supermarket cut the product as part of its plan to reduce the ranges on its shelves by a third.</p> <p>However, Alicia Forry, an analyst at Canaccord Genuity, said Primark\u2019s venture into the US could hit profit margins as it invested in a new warehouse. \u201cWhile the company has invested a lot of time in analysing the US opportunity for Primark, it is not a given that the brand will succeed in that market,\u201d she said.</p>",

Financial records revealed on Thursday morning that the supermarket had taken in twice its usual amount from customers on Wednesday. A swift investigation found that human error was \u201calmost certainly\u201d to blame, according to a Co-op spokesman, but the exact cause was yet to be determined. The company has declined to say how many customers were charged twice, but it is thought that hundreds of thousands of people were affected across Co-op\u2019s 2,800 stores and 200 petrol stations in the UK. A Co-op spokesman said: \u201cDue to a processing error, customers who shopped with us or used a petrol filling station on 7 July using a credit or debit card were charged twice. \u201cWe would like to apologise to all those affected, and reassure customers that refunds will be made directly into their accounts within 24 hours.

Figures showed the Co-op\u2019s food sales for 2014 fell 2.1% to \u00a37.1bn. This was a result of the wider Co-operative Group being hit by the reduction in its stake in the Co-operative Bank \u2013 which dropped from 100% to 20% \u2013 following its emergency re-capitalisation by hedge funds after the bank nearly collapsed in 2013.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Younger workers struggling to find jobs after the financial crisis risk a lifetime trapped at the bottom of the economic ladder unless governments move swiftly to improve their skills and boost investment, according to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). The Paris-based organisation said the global jobs recovery was slowly gathering pace, but long-term unemployment remained a headache for many countries, especially in Europe. More than one in three jobseekers in the 34 OECD countries have been out of work for 12 months or more, equivalent to 15.7m people. The OECD secretary general, Angel Gurr\u00eda, said the figure represented an increase of 77% in long-term unemployment since the end of 2007. More than half of of the people in that category had been out of work for two years or more. \u201cTime is running out to prevent the scars of the crisis becoming permanent, with millions of workers trapped at the bottom of the economic ladder,\u201d said Gurr\u00eda in Paris at the launch of the organisation\u2019s 2015 employment outlook. \u201cIf that happens, the legacy of the crisis would be to ratchet inequality up yet another notch from levels that were already far too high. Governments need to act now to avoid a permanent increase in the number of workers stuck in chronic joblessness or moving between unemployment and low-paid precarious jobs.\u201d Gurr\u00eda, who also said wages had remained stagnant since 2007, highlighted the plight of low-skilled workers in Europe, especially across the Mediterranean belt, who have suffered during six years of high unemployment. \u201cWhile levels [of unemployment] have peaked in the worst-hit countries of southern Europe, youth unemployment remains above pre-crisis level in nearly every OECD country. \u201cThe share of young people neither employed nor in education or training \u2013 the so-called Neets \u2013 is still higher than in 2007 in more than three quarters of OECD countries among 20- to 24-year-olds, and in nearly two thirds of countries among 25- to 29-year-olds,\u201d it said. The OECD has campaigned for governments to direct greater resources to high-grade training to enhance young people\u2019s skills. In the report it points to evidence that shows a person\u2019s long-term career prospects are largely determined in the first ten years of working life. \u201cThis suggests that many of the youth who finished school during the crisis and have struggled to find work since may find their future career opportunities limited,\u201d it said. The report found that the UK and several other wealthy European nations had seen a shift towards part-time and self-employment, despite strong demand from workers for full-time work. The share of workers employed part-time had risen from 18.6% before the crisis, to 20.6% currently, the report said. The Netherlands, at 51.7%, ranked the highest for part-time work, followed by Switzerland at 36.8% and then the UK, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Norway and Sweden. Wage growth across the 34 member countries has slowed from an annual 1.8% between 2000 and 2007 to 0.5% since then. \u201cWage restraint helped limit job losses during the recession and encourage a rebound in employment after, but slower wage growth and real declines in some countries has also reduced the incomes of many households, further contributing to economic hardship,\u201d it said.",

      "bodyText": "The International Monetary Fund has cut its global growth forecast for 2015 after a harsh winter led to a weak start in the US. In an update to its World Economic Outlook (WEO), the Washington-based IMF said it now expected global output to expand by 3.3%, down from the 3.5% it pencilled in three months ago. It also shaved its forecasts for four of the G7 leading industrial countries \u2013 the US, the UK, Japan and Canada \u2013 and said the risks to its forecast were skewed to the downside. Growth in the US is now projected to be 2.5% this year, opposed to the 3.1%the IMF forecast in April. The UK\u2019s growth forecasts have been cut from 2.7% to 2.4% in 2015 and from 2.3% to 2.2% in 2016. The updated WEO showed global growth at 3.3% in 2015, slightly lower than the 3.4% recorded in 2014. In 2016, growth is expected to strengthen to 3.8%. The IMF said it saw activity in the advanced economies picking up from 2.1% this year to 2.4% in 2016, but accepted that the expected acceleration in growth had yet to materialise. \u201cDisruptive asset price shifts and a further increase in financial market volatility remain an important downside risk,\u201d it said. \u201cRaising actual and potential output through a combination of demand support and structural reforms continues to be the economic policy priority.\u201d In advanced economies, the IMF advised central banks to keep bolstering activity and push up inflation. Countries with strong public finances should spend more on infrastructure projects, it said. \u201cIn economies with high public debt, the pace of fiscal consolidation needs to strike an appropriate balance between debt reduction and imposing a drag on economic activity. Efforts at implementing structural reforms remain urgent across advanced economies, both to tackle crisis legacies and to raise potential output.\u201d It added that the economic recovery in the eurozone was broadly on track. \u201cGrowth projections have been revised upward for many euro area economies, but in Greece, unfolding developments are likely to take a much heavier toll on activity relative to earlier expectations.\u201d The IMF added: \u201cThe underlying drivers for a gradual acceleration in economic activity in advanced economies \u2013 easy financial conditions, more neutral fiscal policy in the euro area, lower fuel prices, and improving confidence and labour market conditions \u2013 remain intact.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "George Osborne\u2019s new \u201cliving wage\u201d will fail to compensate low-income workers for the \u00a312bn cuts in the welfare budget, some of which will leave tax credit claimants up to \u00a31,000 a year worse off, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies. In its analysis of the chancellor\u2019s budget, the IFS said the budget was regressive, taking \u201cmuch more\u201d from the poor than the rich. IFS director Paul Johnson said: \u201cUnequivocally, tax credit recipients in work will be made worse off by the measures in the budget on average.\u201d The IFS said there were bound to be more losers than winners, as higher wages from the increase in the minimum wage would amount to \u00a34bn in income, while the welfare changes will save the government \u00a312bn. The IFS said that 13m families would lose an average of \u00a35 a week as a result of extending the freeze in working-age benefits, tax credits and the local housing allowance, until 2020. Changes to Universal Credit, which affect the amount people can earn before benefits start to be withdrawn, will cost 3m families an average of \u00a31,000 a year. Johnson said: \u201cSignificant allowances were an integral part of the design of Universal Credit, intended to give claimants an incentive to move into work. This reform will cost about 3m families an average of \u00a31,000 a year each. It will reduce the incentive for the first earner in the family to enter work. \u201cUC is the government\u2019s flagship welfare reform, championed by the work and pensions minister, Iain Duncan-Smith, who enthusiastically welcomed the chancellor\u2019s budget yesterday.\u201d The IFS said that, in total, the budget included \u00a314bn in tax increases, only partly offset by \u00a38bn in giveaways. Johnson said that the budget would lead to a \u201clower welfare country\u201d, as the chancellor promised, but \u201cwas not quite consistent with the boast that it was aimed at a lower tax country\u201d. Johnson described Osborne\u2019s decision to increase the minimum wage for over-25s to \u00a39 an hour by 2020 as \u201ca gamble\u201d, saying that the only guaranteed way of securing higher wages was to boost productivity. He added: \u201cWe still await details of how that is to be tackled. Simply forcing wage increases by government fiat, by hiking the minimum wage, is more of a gamble.\u201d It was, he said, \u201ca deeply disappointing budget for those of us who hoped the chancellor might take the chance to improve, simplify and reform our creaking tax system. This was not the budget of a tax-reforming chancellor.\u201d Given the array of benefit cuts, he said it was not surprising that \u201cthe changes overall are regressive \u2013 taking much more from poorer households than richer ones\u201d. He added: \u201cLooking over the period of the consolidation as a whole, poorer households have done worse than those in the middle and upper-middle parts of the income distribution, though it remains the case that the some of the biggest losers have been those right at the very top of the income distribution.\u201d Andy Burnham, the Labour leadership contender, called the IFS verdict \u201cdevastating\u201d and condemned the celebrations of Iain Duncan Smith, the work and pensions secretary, in the Commons on Wednesday. Burnham said in a tweet it showed the \u201cnasty party was well and truly back\u201d. Chris Leslie, the shadow chancellor said Labour was \u201cdelighted\u201d that Osborne had \u201cstolen\u201d some of its manifesto policies \u2013 such as the increase in the minimum wage. But he added: \u201cDo not under-estimate how important those tax credits have been for many, many people who will be waking up this morning and I think left reeling by the massive reduction to their quality of life that will come because of the nature of this set of decisions. It will really hit working families hard.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The controversy surrounding tax evasion strategies used by HSBC\u2019s Swiss private banking arm will be reignited next week when Stephen Green, the former boss of the bank, faces questions in the House of Lords. Lord Green, who left HSBC to become trade minister in 2011, will give evidence to the economic affairs committee at a one-off session on the culture of banking. It will be the first time Green has appeared since leaving the government as trade minister in 2013 and since the Guardian and other publications revealed the strategies that HSBC\u2019s Swiss arm used to help customers evade tax. Green was chief executive and then chairman of HSBC from 2003 to 2010, the period covered by the leak of customer data about the banking arm, showing how it turned a blind eye to illegal activities of arms dealers and helped wealthy people evade taxes. The so-called HSBC files, which cover the period 2005-2007, amounted to the biggest banking data leak in history, shedding light on around 30,000 accounts holding almost $120bn (\u00a378bn) in assets. The economic affairs committee, chaired by Clive Hollick, a Labour peer who used to run United Business Media, intends to ask Green about the Swiss operation and HSBC\u2019s Mexican business, which was hit by a \u00a31.2bn fine from the US authorities in 2012. Imposing the fine, US regulators pointed to a \u201cblatant failure\u201d to implement anti-money-laundering controls in the bank\u2019s Mexican operation that allowed local drug traffickers to deposit hundreds of thousands of dollars each day in HSBC accounts. Hollick\u2019s committee will also ask whether global banks are too large to manage and whether the policy of US prosecutors to issue multimillion-pound fines against companies, rather than prosecute individuals, is the right approach to improve the ethics and culture of banks. Green will give evidence alongside Sir Win Bischoff, the veteran banker who is a former chairman of Lloyds Banking Group. Bischoff is currently chairman of the Financial Reporting Council.

      "bodyText": "Are we heading for another stock market crash? The signs are ominous. The New York stock exchange \u2013 the world\u2019s largest stock market \u2013 shut down for three and a half hours due to a mysterious \u201ctechnical issue\u201d on Wednesday; China\u2019s speculative stock market plunged still further, despite tens of billions of dollars of spending on the part of the government in a futile attempt to halt the carnage; Greece is sailing into uncharted territory and teetering on the brink of leaving the Eurozone; and meanwhile Puerto Rico is mired in its own debt crisis. Euripides and Sophocles couldn\u2019t have asked for better material for a financial markets melodrama. Little wonder, therefore, that yesterday turned into a day of carnage on Wall Street, from the moment that US stocks prepared to open for trading early in the morning. There may be more to come. According to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst for S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices, with only an hour to go before the bell rang to signal the start of trading on the floor of the NYSE, the 1.03% decline in the price of futures contracts on the Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s 500 stock index \u2013 the market bellwether \u2013 was the biggest since the autumn of 2008, in the midst of the financial crisis. By the time the day of market horror finally ended, trading had at least resumed on the NYSE, with exchange officials quickly quashing speculation of a cyber-attack. But if you\u2019re looking at your 401k or other investment account statements in the coming days, you may want to brace yourself for a shock: the S&amp;P 500 index tumbled 1.65% to 2,046.91, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.46% to 17,517.76. Most traders reported seeing a sea of red on their screens, and each of the 10 sectors in the S&amp;P 500, from financial stocks and retailers to mining companies, participated in the selloff. If you\u2019re unnerved by what you\u2019ve already witnessed, you may want to prepare yourself for another go on the Dow Jones Terror Ride. \u201cIt\u2019s time to take a deep breath and prepare for more volatility,\u201d says Russ Koesterich, global chief investment strategist at BlackRock, the giant asset management firm. \u201cEvery client I meet is wondering whether these events \u2013 China, Puerto Rico, Greece \u2013 are the first cracks in the edifice like those we saw in 2007, but they aren\u2019t that existential. We just aren\u2019t used to this kind of volatility, so they are going to feel very, very dramatic, and be very serious with respect to the countries concerned.\u201d Translation: investors in US stocks have been too smug for too long. True, the bull market that began back in early 2009 has encountered some big headwinds along the way. When Europe\u2019s debt crisis first flared up, US markets stalled; our own squabbles over whether to raise the debt ceiling had a similar impact. Early last year, biotechnology and some darlings of the technology stock universe were caught in a selloff when the market felt share prices had outstripped fundamentals, like the rate at which profits (if any!) and sales were growing. This time around, however, there are several factors working simultaneously to send stock prices into a tailspin. Last week, all eyes were on Greece. True, its fate shouldn\u2019t really matter to the S&amp;P 500 or the Dow Jones \u2013 Greece\u2019s share of the global gross domestic product is a mere 0.26%, smaller even than that of Iraq in the midst of its civil war. And it\u2019s not as if we hadn\u2019t seen this coming: the word \u201cGrexit\u201d, shorthand for a Greek exit from Europe\u2019s monetary union and the euro, was coined in early 2012. But the treaty that created the new single currency didn\u2019t provide for the possibility of a divorce among the countries abandoning their francs, pesetas and drachmas in favor of the euro. \u201cSo there\u2019s no precedent for what happens next, and markets hate uncertainty,\u201d says Koesterich. China is another matter altogether. Its economic growth \u2013 even under pressure over much of the past decade \u2013 means that it is now the world\u2019s second largest national economy. It is a crucial US trading partner, a source of goods and, increasingly, a market. If the country\u2019s burgeoning middle class have lost their savings thanks to speculation in one of the most startling market bubbles since 1929, then what happens to the profits of companies like Starbucks, Colgate-Palmolive or Papa John\u2019s International, which have bet on growing demand from just that demographic? In the case of China, the speculative fever has been so intense that so far it\u2019s impossible to know just what true market values might be for that country\u2019s stocks. Already the almost apocalyptic selloff has wiped away $3tn from the value of Chinese stocks \u2013 and undoubtedly we haven\u2019t heard the end of it. What are ordinary investors, sitting comfortably in their living rooms or home offices here in North America, supposed to do about it all? If I say \u201cnothing at all\u201d, your first instinct probably will be to have me carted off to the nearest asylum. And yet, what we\u2019re seeing now in the US stock market is but the shadow of events that are taking place in overseas markets. So far, at least, they aren\u2019t taking a toll on the profits or revenues of US companies, with a few exceptions. What they are doing is rattling the nerves of traders and investors and creating tremendous uncertainty \u2013 and fear and uncertainty are the worst enemies of financial markets. \u201cThe market will always focus on the shark that is swimming closest to the boat,\u201d says Russ Koesterich. There are a few steps you can take to ensure your portfolio is bulletproof, of course. If you are worried about liquidity \u2013 about being stuck owning something that you can\u2019t sell when markets are moving very quickly, or when buyers vanish \u2013 you can opt to own index funds or exchange-traded funds tied to big, widely traded indexes. If it\u2019s hard to trade an individual stock or even a large-cap stock fund, it will be much easier to trade one of these products in tougher and more volatile markets. Avoid borrowing to invest: margin debt is what is getting many of those Chinese speculators into so much trouble, and making the rout in Chinese markets even worse than it might otherwise be, as forced selling pushes markets even lower. Given that so much of the turmoil is happening overseas, you can check your portfolio to see how much exposure you have to non-US markets. Don\u2019t just look for foreign stocks or funds, though; think about how much a US company like Apple, for instance, earns by selling its products abroad, and how much economic problems \u2013 including changes in the value of the dollar \u2013 might affect those profits. Ultimately, however, you will need to get accustomed to higher market volatility, of the kind that we saw yesterday. It may feel painful and ugly \u2013 especially when it\u2019s accompanied by an unexplained technical malfunction on the part of the stock exchange\u2019s trading systems. If you need some Valium to get through that transition, so be it; it will also help if you can wean yourself off CNBC, and stop following market events on a minute-by-minute basis. After all, we all are \u2013 or should be \u2013 invested for the long haul. We\u2019ve seen these levels of volatility before. We\u2019ve survived. And the odds are that we\u2019ll live to trade \u2013 or invest \u2013 another day.",

Already the almost apocalyptic selloff has <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/the-chinese-financial-crisis-that-has-wiped-3-trillion-off-the-stock-markets-10375655.html\">wiped away $3tn</a> from the value of Chinese stocks \u2013 and undoubtedly we haven\u2019t heard the end of it.</p> <p> What are ordinary investors, sitting comfortably in their living rooms or home offices here in North America, supposed to do about it all?</p> <p> If I say \u201cnothing at all\u201d, your first instinct probably will be to have me carted off to the nearest asylum. And yet, what we\u2019re seeing now in the US stock market is but the shadow of events that are taking place in overseas markets. So far, at least, they aren\u2019t taking a toll on the profits or revenues of US companies, with a few exceptions. What they are doing is rattling the nerves of traders and investors and creating tremendous uncertainty \u2013 and fear and uncertainty are the worst enemies of financial markets. \u201cThe market will always focus on the shark that is swimming closest to the boat,\u201d says Russ Koesterich.</p> <p> There are a few steps you can take to ensure your portfolio is bulletproof, of course. If you are worried about liquidity \u2013 about being stuck owning something that you can\u2019t sell when markets are moving very quickly, or when buyers vanish \u2013 you can opt to own index funds or exchange-traded funds tied to big, widely traded indexes. If it\u2019s hard to trade an individual stock or even a large-cap stock fund, it will be much easier to trade one of these products in tougher and more volatile markets. Avoid borrowing to invest: margin debt is what is getting many of those Chinese speculators into so much trouble, and making the rout in Chinese markets even worse than it might otherwise be, as forced selling pushes markets even lower.</p> <p> Given that so much of the turmoil is happening overseas, you can check your portfolio to see how much exposure you have to non-US markets. Don\u2019t just look for foreign stocks or funds, though; think about how much a US company like Apple, for instance, earns by selling its products abroad, and how much economic problems \u2013 including changes in the value of the dollar \u2013 might affect those profits.</p> <p> Ultimately, however, you will need to get accustomed to <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/intl/fastft/357181/volatility-spikes-amid-nyse-breakdown\">higher market volatility</a>, of the kind that we saw yesterday. It may feel painful and ugly \u2013 especially when it\u2019s accompanied by an unexplained technical malfunction on the part of the stock exchange\u2019s trading systems. If you need some Valium to get through that transition, so be it; it will also help if you can wean yourself off CNBC, and stop following market events on a minute-by-minute basis. After all, we all are \u2013 or should be \u2013 invested for the long haul.</p> <p>We\u2019ve seen these levels of volatility before. We\u2019ve survived. And the odds are that we\u2019ll live to trade \u2013 or invest \u2013 another day.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s biggest housebuilder says reduced tax breaks for Britain\u2019s two million buy-to-let landlords will not derail the UK housing market. Shares in housebuilders tumbled after the chancellor used his summer budget to reduce the tax relief on buy-to-let mortgages for higher-rate taxpayers. The move triggered warnings of a mass sell-off of homes, or widespread rent rises. Barratt, whose shares have advanced more than 60% over the past year, fell almost 6% after the surprise announcement. They were up 1.7% at 604.5p in early trading on Thursday. The company said it built 16,447 houses in the year to the end of June, up nearly 11% on the previous year. Chief executive David Thomas said the company sold about a 10th of the total to landlords, and most of them were bought for cash or through a company. \u201cThe number of transactions that would be in any way impacted by the changes would be much lower than 10%,\u201d he said. \u201cWe felt the reaction in the market yesterday was very overdone.\u201d However, Greg Hill of smaller housebuilder Hill, which focuses on London and the south-east, said cuts to tax breaks could have an impact: \u201cWe are concerned that the reduction in tax relief for buy-to-let investors to 20% could reduce demand for new homes. Buy-to-let investors are crucial in providing more homes for rent across the UK and these changes could potentially impact the growth of the new-build private rented sector.\u201d From April 2017, landlords will no longer be able to claim tax relief worth 40% or 45% of the interest payments on their buy-to-let mortgages. The maximum tax relief will be set at 20%, although the change will be introduced over a four-year period. The private-rented sector has grown rapidly in recent years, and one in five homes is now owned by landlords. However, property experts said landlords investing through limited companies should be able to avoid the impact of the cut in tax breaks. Barratt estimates it made profits before tax of \u00a3565m in the past year, up 45% on the previous year. This beats City expectations of \u00a3555m of profits. The average house selling price increased 7% to \u00a3235,000. Thomas said demand for property remains strong, outstripping supply. The industry is working hard to ramp up output by a further 50,000 to around 200,000 new homes a year, amid signs that the housing shortage is worsening. He added: \u201cThere is a very significant supply\u2013demand imbalance, so the underlying fundamentals are clearly not affected by yesterday\u2019s announcement. The fundamentals for the market remain very positive.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "China\u2019s stock markets have bounced back, restoring some calm to markets after days of panic selling. The deepening crisis prompted China\u2019s stock exchange regulator to impose severe limits on share selling on Wednesday, warning of a panic in the market \u2013 Beijing\u2019s most drastic step yet. Shareholders with large stakes in listed firms were banned from selling for six months, in an attempt to halt the wild swings seen in stock markets in recent days. The CSI 300 index of the biggest listed companies in Shanghai and Shenzhen gained 6.4% on Thursday, but investors remained nervous. The Shanghai Composite rose 5.8%, the biggest daily percentage gain in six years. Hong Kong\u2019s stock market also rebounded, finishing 3.7% higher. On Wednesday, the Hang Seng dropped 5.8%, its biggest one-day percentage fall since the financial crisis in 2008, as panic spread from China. It remains to be seen whether this is a temporary reprieve or the start of a stabilisation. The bounceback in China boosted global oil prices, with Brent crude up 66 cents at $57.72 (\u00a337.52) a barrel, a 1.2% rise; and New York crude rising 90 cents to $52.55 a barrel, a 1.7% gain. Police and regulators are investigating evidence of potential \u201cmalicious\u201d short selling of Chinese shares, state news agency Xinhua reported. The vice-minister of public security, Meng Qingfeng and a team of officials visited the office of the security regulator on Thursday morning, a sign the authorities will severely punish operations that violate laws and regulations. China\u2019s banking regulator said it would allow banks to extend mortgages that have used shares as collateral. The central bank also announced it was injecting 35bn yuan into the markets. It is the fifth cash injection the People\u2019s Bank of China has carried out since 25 June. Some analysts believe the government\u2019s measures are starting to have an impact. \u201cIt looks like the government plan is quite successful, that the market is again back to having ample liquidity,\u201d said Jiahe Chen, chief strategist at Cinda Securities. But others said it was too early to tell whether the stock market rout is over, noting that about half of all China-listed firms have stopped trading. China\u2019s mainland stocks have lost more than a quarter of their value since reaching a peak on 12 June, in the biggest slide since the global financial crisis in 2008. Some $4tn has been wiped off the stock market value of companies, forcing Chinese regulators to take unprecedented measures to stabilise markets. Economists at Credit Suisse said: \u201cWe are inclined to believe that Beijing will escalate policy responses until they start working. If market conditions do not stabilise, we expect a statement of \u2018whatever it takes\u2019 from the Chinese government, given that social stability is at stake and financial systemic risks are evident.\u201d China\u2019s government, central bank and regulators have been pulling out all the stops to prop up share prices \u2013 including a freeze on new stock market listings and cutting interest rates to new record lows. The country\u2019s top brokerages vowed to buy billions of dollars worth of shares last weekend. But the measures appeared to have little effect in the first three days of this week, with the sell-off continuing. The US administration has expressed concerns the stock market crash could delay Beijing\u2019s economic reforms. There are mounting warnings the Chinese stock market rout poses a bigger risk to the global financial system than the Greek debt crisis. Nigel Green, the founder and chief executive of financial consultancy deVere Group, said: \u201cWith the Chinese stock market losing a third of its value since mid-June, which is about equivalent to the UK\u2019s entire economic output last year, this has all the makings of morphing into a major financial crisis. \u201cDespite few foreign investors having much exposure to the Chinese stock markets, the meltdown matters. Indeed, it is hugely significant because it will send shockwaves throughout global capital markets, not least because China is the world\u2019s second-largest economy and one of the largest consumers of commodities and other goods sold by other countries. As such, China, not Greece, is arguably the main cause for concern for investors right now.\u201d Australian financial services firm AMP lambasted Chinese regulators for contributing to the panic sell-off \u2013 the first time a foreign investor has publicly criticised Beijing\u2019s intervention in its markets. The firm\u2019s AMP Capital China Growth Fund, the biggest Australian fund that invests exclusively in China shares, has seen its market value shrink by A$272m to A$440m. However, Chen believes it is important the government is taking some action. The worst thing for a financial market \u201cis not the fluctuation of price, but overall lacking of confidence and liquidity. It needs government action to reverse this kind of situation as it is not a normal situation that can be corrected by the market itself,\u201d he said. In China, some 80% of investors are individuals, many of whom have borrowed from a broker to play the stock market. The past six months have seen a record number of businesses listed on the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges, and an explosion in margin trading. This means a broker can ask for more cash or other collateral if the price of securities falls, which is known as a margin call. As regulators have cracked down on margin trading, falling share prices have triggered margin calls \u2013 forcing investors to offload assets to come up with the cash. HSBC cut its growth outlook for this year for Asia excluding Japan to 6.3% from 6.5%. \u201cThings aren\u2019t exactly going according to plan,\u201d the bank said on Wednesday. \u201cAsia\u2019s export malaise is not just a temporary blip, but reflects longer-lasting structural factors, with a trade rebound unlikely.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The government\u2019s new national living wage will have a devastating impact on independent retailers and could lead to price rises for shoppers, analysts have warned. Store executives and industry experts said that the retail sector, which employs vast numbers of staff on or just above the national minimum wage, would be forced to cut jobs, reduce staff working hours and pass on additional costs to their shoppers when the wage, announced in Wedensday\u2019s budget, is introduced next April at \u00a37.20 an hour for the over-25s. Around one in 10 UK workers are employed in retail and hundreds of thousands are so poorly paid that they rely on in-work benefits to make ends meet, despite working full time. The bosses of major retail chains warned that any rise in basic pay for workers is likely to mean cuts in other benefits, such as annual bonuses, staff discounts or pension payments. The mandatory pay rise for workers aged over 25 comes amid tough competition on the high street and online. The big four grocers are under substantial pressure to keep costs down so they can cut prices to stop shoppers switching to discounters such as Aldi and Lidl. The Association of Convenience Stores, which represents thousands of small independent grocery outlets, said its members were likely to have to reduce the number of hours that their staff work, cancel investment plans or work more hours in their business themselves. James Lowman, the chief executive, said: \u201cThe introduction of a compulsory living wage will have a devastating impact on thousands of convenience stores ... to introduce this undermines the independent Low Pay Commission and is a reckless way to impose a massive burden on small businesses.\u201d The minimum wage rise is a further blow for small businesses which also face new plans to enable individual towns and cities to loosen Sunday trading regulation to allow big stores to open for longer. Michael Weedon, deputy chief executive of the British Independent Retailers Association, said the reduction in corporation tax, also announced in the budget, would not help the majority of small businesses because most didn\u2019t make enough profit to pay it. He said stores faced having to \u201ceither cut hours, or jobs, or both\u201d. The British Retail Consortium, which represents the majority of the UK\u2019s largest retailers, said its members paid an average \u00a37.30 an hour already. However, paying the national living wage will increase costs for businesses. A senior executive at one large retailer said that every penny on wages would slice \u00a32m off his firm\u2019s bottom line. Bruno Monteyne, a retail analyst at research firm Bernstein, said: \u201cRetailers are not magic machines that eat up inflation. Ultimately the consumer will pay for the increase in wages.\u201d He added that the wage rise would be a new boost to the discount grocers, which employ relatively few staff in relation to the amount of goods they sell. However, the pay increases are a victory for campaigners who have been challenging big businesses including Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s, Marks &amp; Spencer, Next and Morrisons at their annual shareholder meetings over low wages. Last month, Tesco boss Dave Lewis told campaigners that the retailer was in detailed talks with the trade union Usdaw about restructuring pay packages to increase basic salary. But he insisted the total amount available for workers could not be increased this year. On Wednesday , Mike Coupe, the chief executive of Sainsbury\u2019s, said he could not commit to paying the living wage as calculated by the independent Living Wage Foundation \u2013 \u00a39.15 in London and an average \u00a37.85 across the rest of the UK \u2013 within the next year. He explained one way of moving closer to paying the living wage would be to cut back on staff benefits such as a discount card or annual bonus. But he said more than 90% of staff would opt to keep their discount card rather than a rise in pay. \u201cIf we take away benefits to improve the base rate I don\u2019t think that would be popular,\u201d he told campaigners. However, the boss of another major retailer pointed out that most employers campaigned against the original minimum wage, introduced in 1999, insisting it would be disastrous. Those warnings proved unfounded. He said: \u201cMaking sure hard-working staff are getting paid well is never a bad thing. They are also customers and many of our other customers might see their pay rise. On balance it will be OK.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "George Osborne has infuriated green energy producers and campaigners with a \u00a3910m-a-year raid on the renewable energy sector by changing a climate change levy (CCL) at the same time as providing more fiscal help for North Sea oilfields. RenewableUK, the lobby group, said the changes would cost green energy producers around \u00a3450m in the current financial year, and up to \u00a31bn by 2020-2021. The move hammered the share price of power generator Drax which is in the process of converting stations from burning coal to burning wood pellets. The company lost more than a quarter of its stock market value as it said the move would cost it \u00a330m this year and \u00a360m in 2016. Caroline Lucas, the Green party MP, described the budget as a \u201cserious blow for the fight against climate change\u201d, while Greenpeace said it showed the chancellor is out of step with the times. Osborne insisted the Conservative government would still continue to promote low carbon investment and would be pushing for a deal at United Nations talks in Paris later this year to limit global warming to 2C. But his budget measures included removing the CCL exemption from renewable electricity schemes and promised streamlining other taxes. \u201cThe government will review the business energy efficiency tax landscape and consider approaches to simplify and improve the effectiveness of the regime. A consultation will be launched in autumn 2015,\u201d he said. Osborne also promised to bring forward proposals for a sovereign wealth fund for communities that host shale gas developments, to expand the North Sea investment, and cluster area allowances to include additional activities. Phil Grant, of management consultants Baringa Partners, said the budget was bad news for investors in green power. \u201cBritain is a world leader in green energy but the abolishment of climate change levies for renewables is another blow for an already fragile sector. Investors were perturbed by recent decisions \u2026 to reduce subsidies for new renewable plants and we\u2019ve seen the share prices of companies exposed to renewables take a further hit this afternoon.\u201d Gordon Edge, RenewableUK\u2019s director of policy, said that until now, Levy Exemption Certificates generated as a result of the CCL had provided vital financial support for renewable energy producers. \u201cThe government had already announced an end to future financial support for onshore wind \u2013 even though it\u2019s the most cost-effective form of clean energy we have. Now they\u2019re imposing retrospective cuts on projects already up and running across the entire clean energy sector. \u201cYet again the government is moving the goalposts, pushing some marginal projects from profit into loss. It\u2019s another example of this government\u2019s unfair, illogical and obsessive attacks on renewables\u201d. Caroline Lucas said that axing the CCL exemption for renewable electricity, committing to further funding for road building, and doing nothing to push forward a low-carbon agenda more widely jeopardised progress on climate change. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen yet another example of reckless short-term policy making that prioritises the profits of polluters over the public interest in a safe and habitable climate,\u201d she added. Doug Parr, director of policy at Greenpeace, said Osborne was now taxing clean-power schemes as if they were fossil fuel. \u201cThis will make it more expensive for business to buy electricity from renewable power. He is man out of step with the times,\u201d he added. But the move to review the impact of energy efficiency measures on bill payers was welcomed by the EEF, manufacturing employers organisation. \u201cFifteen years of layering and tinkering with policy has left us with a vast patchwork of expensive, inefficient and incoherent policy drivers for decarbonisation,\u201d said the EEF\u2019s director of policy, Paul Raynes. \u201cWe urgently need to revisit the policy landscape to reduce costs, improve the business environment and better deliver on our policy objective of reducing emissions,\u201d he added. Meanwhile Catherine Mitchell, a professor of energy policy at the University of Exeter, said the government wanted a sustainable, secure and affordable energy system but had introduced policy changes that took the UK away from that goal. \u201cThe ending of subsidies for onshore wind farms, our cheapest low-carbon electricity resource, the failure to exploit the potential of energy efficiency, the removal of the Climate Change Levy exemption for renewable energy, and support for unpopular fracking and extortionately expensive nuclear power does not add up to a credible energy policy,\u201d she said adding: \u201cIt reduces the chances of us meeting our various legal requirements, and presents serious political risk to investors, which in itself makes energy more expensive.\u201d Sam Fankhauser, a professor and deputy director at the ESRC Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy at the London School of Economics, said the move on renewable electricity compromised the effectiveness of the Climate Change Levy as a form of carbon pricing. But he believed a review of green taxes could be constructive: \u201cUK energy taxes can and should be reformed to make them less burdensome for businesses, deliver increased revenues for HM Treasury and reduce carbon emissions more efficiently. For instance, the Carbon Reduction Commitment Energy Efficiency Scheme, Climate Change Levy and Climate Change Agreement can be combined into one single instrument.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Right now, China\u2019s stock market is crashing. In the past month, the Shanghai Composite Index (essentially its version of Australia\u2019s All Ordinaries Index) has fallen by 30%. The sell-off of stocks prompted the Chinese government to try to stem the tide. At the end of June it cut its official interest rates to 4.85%. This was the fourth such cut this year. The interest rate is now 115 basis points below the 6.0% it was this time last year, yet the share market keeps falling. On Wednesday the Chinese government got all bolshie and suspended trade in about half the stocks. A state-owned wealth fund began buying just under $20bn worth of shares with a view to hold them until the Shanghai index had risen 20%. It is sweet to see a communist government, in 2015, try to hold back market forces. It worked about as well as you would expect. On Wednesday the market opened down 8% on the previous day. It recovered a bit during the day before finishing down 5.9%. Capitalism 1, communism 0. But while this all sounds pretty much like doom, it\u2019s worth noting the Shanghai Composite Index remains 72% above where it was 12 months ago. The reality is the Chinese stock market was in a massive bubble, fuelled by margin lending (where people borrow to buy shares) and investors seeking better returns as the Chinese property market faltered. Now it is bursting: How big the burst will be is, as ever, up for debate. Some suggest a lower level may have been found. But the Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong, which is generally a good guide to how the Chinese market will go, lost 8.5% of its value on Wednesday. Now it is 1.2% below where it was a year ago. Clearly the Shanghai index has grown a tad out of whack with economic reality. So should we be worried? Well, yeah. In the normal course of events, a fall such as this would not be overly worrying. Clearly a correction was required; stock markets often see a fall after such a rapid rise as we saw this year in China. Measures the Chinese government has introduced in the past week \u2013 allowing for greater margin lending, suspending stocks, stopping the release of new stock issues \u2013 smell like panic. You could argue that such was the size of these measures, they themselves helped fuel some of the selling on Wednesday. Panic begets panic. It\u2019s a panic that suggests the Chinese government is more than a bit concerned about the impact of any falls on the broader Chinese economy. Some commentators have noticed the parallels between China now and the United States in the 1929 Wall Street crash, which also followed large margin lending. Such talk gets pretty scary, given China accounts for over 30% of Australian exports: The Chinese economy is not doing well, despite its government\u2019s best efforts to boost growth through easing monetary policy. The latest industrial output figures show annual growth not far above where it was during the GFC: The sense is that China\u2019s ability to grow off the back of its cheap exports is diminished, given increases in labour and production costs. Thus now it aims to produce more of its growth from internal consumption. It is becoming less likely that China will be able to reach its target of 7% annual GDP growth. The fall in the share market \u2013 while perhaps not having as huge an impact on people\u2019s wealth as it would in other nations where more people own shares \u2013 will certainly not make for brave spending by Chinese households. China remains a command economy, which gives it ballast against a Great Depression-like outcome. Its financial and economic system is able to essentially ignore economic realities to keep lending and spending. But that can only happen for so long before reality kicks down the door. This week the share market has shown the limits of the government\u2019s power, and that will not go unnoticed by Chinese consumers. The Chinese housing market, although slightly better than it was six months ago, is unlikely to gain much strength from this. Declining Chinese consumption growth and a continuing weak housing market spell bad things for our exports. The latest advice by the office of the chief economist in the Australian government\u2019s Department of Industry noted that \u201cChina\u2019s steel exports remain elevated against expectations but in the absence of a housing recovery, China\u2019s steel production is likely to drop in the short term\u201d. Forget the housing recovery now, it would seem. And with steel production falls come a fall in iron ore prices \u2013 which have slumped below US$50 a tonne in the past week: For the moment the price remains above that forecast in the May budget, but the wriggle room is getting small \u2013 and any further falls start to really hit the budget\u2019s projected bottom line. Shrinking as well are the profit margins for mining companies. BHP has a break even price on iron ore of around US$50 a tonne and for Rio Tinto it is in the low US$40s. One bright spot for us is this is also driving down the value of our dollar \u2013 on Wednesday it went below US75 cents for the first time in six years: The RBA has been desperate for the dollar to fall to around US 70 cents and, given the likely further fall in iron ore prices, that must now be a real chance. Non-mining exporters will be cheering. But with the falls in those prices also come falls in our national income and concerns that the dollars (both in profits and in tax revenue) from the export side of the mining boom may not be as bountiful as hoped. As the apocryphal Chinese curse goes: \u201cMay you live in interesting times.\u201d Thanks to China, the times are interesting for anyone trying to manage our economy.",
