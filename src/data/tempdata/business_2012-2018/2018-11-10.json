      "bodyText": "It should be one of the bright spots in the British economy, one that shines through the Brexit gloom, but the higher education sector has become a pin on which balances the most enormous mountain of debt. And with speculation that institutions may be in financial trouble circulating around the sector, ministers are nervous. Recent figures show that UK universities have borrowed \u00a312bn since the financial crash \u2013 from their banks, from private investors, mostly in the US, and from the international bond markets. Calculated by Reuters and published in the International Financing Review (IFR), the debt figure follows a string of deals by the likes of Oxford and Cambridge, Liverpool, Bristol and Cardiff universities. Oxford borrowed \u00a3750m over 100 years at an interest rate of 2.5% and is seen as a safe bet. Cardiff was not far behind, borrowing \u00a3300m at 3% over 40 years. However, the Welsh institution ran a surplus of just \u00a3145,000 in the year to July 2017. At this rate, when the loan ends and the capital must be repaid, \u201cit would take over 2,000 years to pay off the debt\u201d, the IFR reported. This colossal and rising total of university borrowing is dwarfed by projections for a rise in student debt from the current \u00a3100bn to \u00a31tn over the next 25 years and the hundreds of millions borrowed to build student accommodation. Not only is there a mountain of debt reliant on the success of the sector: universities generate \u00a395bn for the economy and \u00a312.5bn of exports. Towns and cities in Britain with a university or two derive huge benefits from the economic activity they generate. Council leaders fall over themselves to please their local vice-chancellors. With so much at stake, anyone would think that ministers would follow suit. Unfortunately, that doesn\u2019t seem to be the case. While there are MPs and officials in Whitehall who understand how crucial higher education has become to the finances and fabric that underpin the British economy, the cabinet continues to procrastinate about two crucial issues \u2013 reforms of the student fees system and the treatment of foreign students by the Home Office. The prime minister has set in train a review of post-18 technical education, which is a much neglected subject, but does little to address the difficulties faced by more academically focused universities. Many of them, especially the second tier and below, are left in a tricky position. Most have already cut costs by driving their academic and ancillary staff onto precarious short-term and zero-hours contracts. Then there is the number of 18-year-olds, which is falling. So is the number of foreign students. Oxford and Cambridge will attract students from abroad who are prepared to jump through the Home Office\u2019s hoops. But the less-well-known colleges, and even the Russell Group universities, are already losing out. Loans deals, many of which were signed in the euphoria following 2012 \u2013 when colleges, suddenly awash with student loan cash, made a dash for growth \u2013 add another layer of cost. Unfortunately, debts that were once deemed affordable might not be in the next few years as annual budgets come under strain. Last week, Sir Michael Barber, the head of the university regulator, the Office for Students (OFS), insisted the government would let higher education institutions in financial trouble go to the wall. Barber, a former Institute of Education professor, former Labour government adviser, ex-head of McKinsey\u2019s global education practice and chair of the OFS, knows his stuff, but those who lend serious amounts of money to the UK education sector seem to think otherwise. Moody\u2019s, the credit ratings agency, has built into its analysis the assumption that university loans are gilt-edged \u2013 that is to say that lending to a university is as good as lending to the government. This contradiction can be explained by the existence of a divide between the top tier of universities, which are probably safe with or without a government guarantee, and the rest, which could be let go \u2013 but with consequences not just for the debt holders. Local communities would suffer and, more broadly, the nation would see a star industry founder. Andrew McGettigan, author of The Great University Gamble, warned in 2012 that George Osborne and David Willetts, the chancellor and higher education minister respectively, risked killing a golden goose by loading it up with debt. Today it is even clearer that ministers, should they sit on their hands, will push the system further into the red and weaker institutions closer to collapse.",

      "bodyText": "Peloton, the virtual spin class aiming to be the Netflix of fitness, has already saddled up celebrity fans including David Beckham and Hugh Jackman. Now it is spending \u00a350m in the UK as part of a bid to sign up 1 million members in Europe. The New York-based company has given the exercise bike a high-tech spin, adding a screen on which subscribers can live stream or download classes filmed at the company\u2019s Manhattan studio, while interacting with other Peloton members via social media. Instructors can interact with hundreds of fitness fans riding along at home. Valued at $4bn after raising $550m this summer from investors led by the private equity firm TCV, which has previously backed Netflix, Spotify and Facebook, the company will launch a multi-million pound national TV and digital billboard advertising campaign later this month and is building its first fitness studio outside the US in London\u2019s Covent Garden. David Minton, the director of fitness market analysts DBLeisure, said: \u201cThey have got so much money this is like McDonalds doing a national TV ad when it just has one shop. It\u2019s a bit of a landgrab.\u201d Peloton has hired two British instructors who will begin live streaming classes from London next week. It wants to take on up to eight more in the the next couple of years as it uses London as its base for European expansion. It has also signed up six pop-up shops in London and is looking for premises in northern cities such as Manchester. Peloton faces competition from New Zealand\u2019s Les Mills, a company which made its name in the 1990s by creating the Bodypump fitness class. It has been streaming virtual fitness classes to gyms in the UK for several years and offers on demand classes, which can be done at home without equipment. The company has now teamed up with the exercise bike maker Stages to offer a service similar to Peloton\u2019s in the UK. Both firms are trying to catch a ride on a growing niche within the buoyant fitness market in the UK, as ageing baby boomers invest in staying healthy, while younger generations put time and money into ensuring they are selfie-fit. This year the number of gyms in the UK topped 7,000 for the first time, with total membership approaching 10 million, up 2.2% on last year, according to DBLeisure. In the year to March alone, 275 new fitness facilities opened in the UK, helping lift the value of the fitness market to just under \u00a35bn, up nearly 3% on last year at a time when many other consumer businesses are suffering. Kevin Cornils, the managing director of Peloton\u2019s international division, said London was the obvious next step for the company because of the surge in high-end boutique gyms in the capital in recent years. The eager adoption of road cycling by high spending \u201cMamils\u201d \u2013 middle-aged men in Lycra - also offers a potentially lucrative market. The company is trying to tempt them in by hiring pro cyclists such as Christian Vande Velde to lead classes that offer tailored playlists for fans of hip hop or 1980s music. \u201cYou have got the Mamil community here which we don\u2019t have in the US,\u201d said Kevin Cornils, managing director of Peloton\u2019s international division. \u201cThey were initially cynical about spin classes but they are ready to spend the right amount of money to get good equipment. We are hoping they will see Peloton as a complement to their road bike.\u201d The company\u2019s 1 million members, the vast majority of whom are currently in the US, pay nearly \u00a32,000 for a purpose-built exercise bike fitted with a screen, and for a \u00a339 a month subscription they can live stream one of 14 exercise classes a day from the company\u2019s New York studio or choose from 10,000 on demand rides. Riders can see who else is taking part at the same time, electronically \u201chigh five\u201d friends or compete against others in the class or in their age group. The British instructors will begin leading classes from a temporary studio in east London from 13 November, and will move to a permanent gym in Floral Street, in Covent Garden, in about 18 months. It already has 50 staff in the UK but wants to double that within a year. Cornils said the company has already installed hundreds of bikes in the UK, some of which were brought over by wealthy fans, and it had 3,000 Britons enquiring about bikes before it even launched.",

      "bodyText": "The administrators of now-collapsed Foodora Australia have admitted it is \u201cmore likely than not\u201d their food delivery riders were employees rather than independent contractors \u2013 and are owed more than $5m in unpaid wages. The admission is a world-first and could have significant impacts on the \u201cgig economy\u201d around the world, including competitors such as Uber, Uber Eats and Deliveroo. Foodora\u2019s parent company \u2013 German company Delivery Hero \u2013 is offering to pay $3m to the company\u2019s creditors, which includes underpaid workers, but also the Australian tax office, and the NSW, Victoria and Queensland state offices of revenue. The Transport Workers Union has vowed to go after the parent company for the full amount of unpaid wages. On Thursday, the administrators released a report in which they conceded Foodora had been underpaying its workers by incorrectly classing them as independent contractors. Contractors have greater flexibility to choose when to work, but are not entitled to award wages, penalty rates or annual leave \u2013 which are only available to employees. This meant some food app riders earned as little as $6 an hour. Uber Eats and Deliveroo still claim their food deliverers are contractors, not employees. But Foodora has admitted \u201cit is more likely than not that the majority of the delivery riders and drivers should have been classified as at least casual employees\u201d. They found 20% of deliverers worked full-time hours (38 a week) at least once, and 5% of workers worked more than 38 hours a week for more than four weeks. Under current Australian labour law, a mix of factors determines whether a person is an independent contractor or an employee. In June, the Fair Work ombudsman took Foodora to the federal court alleging that at least three workers should have been classed as full-time employees. The then-ombudsman, Natalie James, said the company exerted a high level of control \u2013 it made riders wear branded uniforms and sign up for set shifts, and restricted them to certain areas. The administrator\u2019s report agreed with many of these points: \u201cEach rider/driver should have been provided with entitlements under the Fast Food Industry Award 2010 \u2026 from our sampling of the riders, it would appear to be more likely than not that the riders were casual employees. This appears to be consistent with the nature of the work, the hours worked and the position taken by the [tax office] in relation to their employee obligations audit.\u201d However, it said each individual would have to be looked at on a case-by-case basis. In August, the company announced it would close its Australian operations within a month after financial issues and the pending court case. The administrator\u2019s report estimated that riders, if paid the lowest casual rate, would be entitled to $28m total in wages, but were paid only $23m. However, Foodora did not have enough money to cover all the company\u2019s debts. Foodora also owes $2.1m in unpaid tax, $550,000 to Revenue NSW and an estimated $400,000 to Victoria and Queensland revenue, combined. The report also revealed the company had made a loss every year since 2015. Over four calendar years, the company lost $3.3m, $10.9m, $7.5m and $7m, respectively. Tony Sheldon from the TWU said the union intended to pursue the German parent company, which was solvent. He said the admission strengthened the case against Uber and Deliveroo that their workers were also employees. \u201cIt\u2019s a business model based on wage theft and that is the brave new world of work,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it strengthens the case against Uber Eats, Uber and the like. \u201cSeventy per cent of delivery riders are visa holders, many of them students from overseas. The average age being 23, there is a responsibility for the government to pursue this company literally to the ends of the world.\u201d",
