      "bodyText": "Roll up, roll up, who wants to buy Shire? The FTSE 100 pharmaceutical company, itself built by acquisitions, is suddenly in the spotlight. Takeda of Japan has made three offers. Shire rebuffed the lot but wanted to keep talking, presumably in the hope of getting better terms. Then Allergan of the US, maker of Botox, said it was contemplating an offer before deciding against. Somebody else may be along in a minute. For the time being, though, Takeda is the only game in town and there\u2019s a problem: its third offer was worth \u00a344bn, or \u00a346.50 a share, but carried the whiff of overadventurous financial engineering. It\u2019s not obvious that Takeda, which is smaller than Shire, can make the takeover numbers work. A worry about Shire \u2013 and a reason its share price had slipped to \u00a330 a month ago \u2013 was its level of debt. The figure was $19bn (\u00a313.4bn) at the last count. Yet the Takeda proposal would involve adding leverage to leverage. The Japanese company would have to find \u00a316.7bn to pay the cash component of the offer to Shire shareholders. To fund the rest of the transaction, Takeda would virtually double its number of shares in issue so that Shire investors end up with 51% of the new company. That structure may suit Takeda but it\u2019s hard to see the appeal for Shire\u2019s shareholders. If Takeda was offering pure cash, finding the readies would be its own shareholders\u2019 problem. Why, though, should the London owners of Ireland-based Shire want to own half of a heavily indebted Japanese pharmaceutical firm? Shire\u2019s board was right to reject the offer: Takeda should be told to massively improve the proportion of upfront cash. Allergan, also smaller than Shire, faced the same problem of size. The 6% fall in the US group\u2019s share price will not have helped either. Takeda\u2019s shares, though, have slipped further \u2013 by 8% since it made its first approach. Maybe it just can\u2019t sensibly afford this deal. Same old strategy for Debenhams Debenhams has cut its dividend in half, unveiled an 85% slump in bottom-line profits for the half-year and said its restructuring programme will cost \u00a385m, not the \u00a355m originally projected. And, by the way, the finance director is off to Selfridges. The chief executive, Sergio Bucher, gamely tried to look on the bright side. He is \u201chugely encouraged\u201d by progress with his \u201cRedesigned\u201d strategy to make Debenhams a leader in \u201cshopping as a fun leisure activity centred around mobile interaction,\u201d which, frankly, sounds much the same as every other old-school retailer\u2019s survival strategy. It is unfair to judge a three-year plan after 12 months but the journey to the promised land of profitable growth looks harder than at the outset. Five years ago, Debenhams was making \u00a3139m of pre-tax profits; this year\u2019s outcome will be close to \u00a350m. For investors, the best that can be said is that the share price may be overstating the gloom. At 22p, Debenhams is worth just \u00a3270m. Yes, it is carrying debt of \u00a3248m, but borrowings are well within covenants. That position buys time and hope that rivals will go out of business or shrink, gifting a few shoppers to Debs. It\u2019s something to cling to. So is the thought that the government might wake up and recognise that a reform of business rates is overdue. Justin King, the former chief executive of Sainsbury\u2019s, made the point (again) yesterday that online retailers enjoy the enormous advantage of not paying a property-based tax that their store-based counterparts can\u2019t avoid. The system is behind the times. King is right \u2013 it\u2019s time ministers addressed a playing field that is unfairly tilted. Alarm over Unilever \u201cWe remain highly confident of achieving the required level of shareholder support,\u201d says Graeme Pitkethly, Unilever\u2019s chief financial officer, talking about the proposal to abandon the Anglo-Dutch corporate structure and go wholly Dutch. We\u2019ll see how that works out but the mood music among UK investors is not good. Only Columbia Threadneedle has dared to announce its concerns but the FT reports that three top-20 investors and one top-40 house are also alarmed. One cannot be surprised. Unilever would retain a listing in London but, crucially, it would exit the FTSE 100 index. That would create huge selling pressures among those funds that track the blue-chip index or are obliged to hold a given percentage in UK-indexed stocks. Why would any fund in that position be in favour of Unilever\u2019s rejig? The only logical vote would be against a proposal that requires a 75% majority of shareholders in the plc class of share.

    "webTitle": "Oil price hits three-year high of $74 a barrel", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Oil has hit a new three-and-a-half-year peak, and other commodity prices \u2013 notably nickel and aluminium \u2013 moved sharply higher as Donald Trump\u2019s sanctions and the continuing conflict in Syria fuelled fears of supply shortages. Brent crude rose 1.7% to $74.74 (\u00a352.67) a barrel on Thursday, the highest level since November 2014 when oil group Opec began increasing production to protect its market share, a move that subsequently led to a supply glut and a price slump to $27 a barrel just over a year later. More recently Opec had agreed with Russia, another major supplier, to cap output and protect prices, even though growing production from US shale companies threatened to undermine this strategy. However a surprise drop in US oil inventories this week, along with concerns about Middle Eastern supply following the military strikes on Syria by the US, the UK and France, have kept crude prices buoyant. Meanwhile, ahead of an Opec meeting on Friday, Reuters reported that Saudi Arabia wanted to see prices as high as $100 a barrel. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: \u201cFriday sees a host of energy ministers from some of the most influential oil producing nations meet in the Saudi city of Jeddah, heightening anticipation of what could be yet another production freeze/cut extension in the offing.\u201d Lee Wild, head of equity strategy at Interactive Investor, said: \u201cDespite the influence of US shale, Saudi Arabia still calls the shots on global oil markets, and it\u2019s increasingly obvious the Saudis are comfortable with oil at $80 or more. Add a drop in weekly US oil reserves to the mix and the only way for crude prices is up. Saudi bullishness should be no surprise given it must somehow bankroll Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman\u2019s expensive reforms and modernisation at home.\u201d There is also the prospect that the US might reinstate sanctions next month on Iran, the third largest producer in Opec, over its nuclear programme. Even if Iran escapes renewed sanctions, Trump\u2019s moves to impose tariffs on steel and aluminium and on 1,300 Chinese products \u2013 prompting fears of a global trade war \u2013 and his actions against Russian metal companies have already had a major effect on other commodity prices. Earlier this month the US imposed sanctions on a number of Russian oligarchs and companies, including aluminium-producer Rusal, and there are suggestions that these could be broadened to include key Russian nickel supplier Nornickel. The company is linked to both Rusal and the oligarch who controls it, Oleg Deripaska. UBS analyst Lachlan Shaw told Reuters: \u201cA logical extension would be if you were to broaden sanctions, then Norilsk would fall under that remit.\u201d Nickel \u2013 used to make stainless steel and is a key component in rechargeable batteries used in mobile phones and electric cars \u2013 surged as much as 9.3% to $16,690 a tonne on Thursday, the highest since December, 2014. That followed a 7.5% rise on Wednesday. Aluminium rose 5% on Thursday, making a 32% rise this month. But Julius Baer analyst Carsten Menke said the recent moves in metals like nickel could be due to speculation rather than fundamental issues. He told Reuters: \u201cIf any commodity moves more than 10% in two days, it\u2019s either a severe disruption to supplies, which we don\u2019t have in this case, or it\u2019s speculators. In the case of nickel it\u2019s the latter, the rally is absolutely overdone.\u201d The Trump tariffs on steel and aluminium have already prompted complaints to the World Trade Organisation from the European Union, India and China, and on Thursday they were joined by Russia. The complaint argues that the tariffs are aimed at protecting US domestic producers from surging imports rather than \u2013 as the US argues \u2013 for national security reasons. A number of countries, including Canada, Mexico, South Korea and Australia \u2013 as well as the EU, have won temporary exemptions from application of the tariffs, pending talks with the US.",

More recently Opec had agreed with Russia, another major supplier, to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/nov/30/opec-likely-to-extend-production-curbs-to-bolster-oil-prices\">cap output and protect prices</a>, even though growing production from US shale companies threatened to undermine this strategy.</p> \n<p>However a surprise drop in US oil inventories this week, along with concerns about Middle Eastern supply following <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/14/syria-air-strikes-us-uk-and-france-launch-attack-on-assad-regime\">the military strikes on Syria</a> by the US, the UK and France, have kept crude prices buoyant. </p> \n<p>Meanwhile, ahead of an Opec meeting on Friday, Reuters reported that Saudi Arabia wanted to see prices as high as $100 a barrel. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: \u201cFriday sees a host of energy ministers from some of the most influential oil producing nations meet in the Saudi city of Jeddah, heightening anticipation of what could be yet another production freeze/cut extension in the offing.\u201d</p> \n<p>Lee Wild, head of equity strategy at Interactive Investor, said:<em> </em>\u201cDespite the influence of US shale, Saudi Arabia still calls the shots on global oil markets, and it\u2019s increasingly obvious the Saudis are comfortable with oil at $80 or more. Add a drop in weekly US oil reserves to the mix and the only way for crude prices is up. Saudi bullishness should be no surprise given it must somehow bankroll Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman\u2019s expensive reforms and modernisation at home.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Email sign up\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>There is also the prospect that the US might reinstate sanctions next month on Iran, the third largest producer in Opec, over its nuclear programme.</p> \n<p>Even if Iran escapes renewed sanctions, Trump\u2019s moves to <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/08/donald-trump-metal-tariffs-trade-war\">impose tariffs on steel and aluminium</a> and on <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/03/us-plans-tariffs-chinese-imports-list\">1,300 Chinese products</a> \u2013 prompting fears of a global trade war \u2013 and his actions against Russian metal companies have already had a major effect on other commodity prices.</p> \n<p>Earlier this month the US imposed sanctions <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/apr/06/trump-russia-sanctions-election-meddling-latest\">on a number of Russian oligarchs and companies</a>, including aluminium-producer Rusal, and there are suggestions that these could be broadened to include key Russian nickel supplier Nornickel.

Speaking at a press conference to mark the start of the IMF\u2019s spring meeting in Washington, Lagarde said breaking up companies was not the solution, but added that her organisation was monitoring their impact on prosperity, financial stability and the workplace. \u201cCompetition is needed. From competition you get productivity growth and innovation. Too much concentration, too much market power in the hands of the few is not helpful to the economy or to the wellbeing of individuals.\u201d Pressure has been building in the US for antitrust laws to be used to break up some of the biggest companies, with Google, Facebook and Amazon all targeted by critics. Lagarde said: \u201cI am not sure breaking up some of the tech titans in this country [the US] or in other countries will be the right answer. It used to be the right answer, but when most of the assets are intangible, how do you break them up? How do you facilitate access and allow market disruptors to operate? I think that is where a lot of new thinking has to be done.\u201d The IMF is carefully monitoring new digital currencies such as Bitcoin, which it says are prone to fraud and can be used for money laundering. \u201cWe have seen a flourishing of cryptocurrencies. There are now more than 100. That has stability implications eventually. We do not think it is systemic at this point in time but regulators and supervisors have to be watchful.\u201d Lagarde expressed concern at the growing threat of a trade war between the US and China, saying that protectionism posed a threat to the upswing in the global economy and to an international system that had served countries well. She said the actual impact of the proposed US and Chinese tariffs would be small. \u201cIt is more difficult to measure the erosion of confidence. When investors don\u2019t know the terms on which they are trading, they are reluctant to invest. Growth is being driven by more investment and trade, so why damage those engines?\u201d Britain is one developed country that has not seen its growth prospects upgraded by the IMF over the past year. The Washington-based organisation expects growth of around 1.5% this year and next. Although the UK economy has performed better than the IMF expected prior to the EU referendum in June 2016, Lagarde said there had been a negative impact from Brexit. \u201cThe cloud of uncertainty that covers the British economy is one reason the UK is not enjoying the same upswing as other advanced countries. Hopefully it will clear up as time goes by.\u201d Lagarde said the UK needed to sort out its new trading arrangements with the European Union and 150 countries around the world. \u201cOnce that has been settled, once the cloud has been dissipated, hopefully Britain will be in a better position to benefit from the upswing.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The drugs company Shire is at the centre of a multibillion-pound takeover battle after the Botox-maker Allergan emerged as a rival suitor to Japan\u2019s Takeda, which is also hoping to clinch a deal. Shire, which makes the ADHD drug Adderall and focuses on rare diseases, was the top FTSE 100 riser on Thursday after Allergan said it was considering making an offer. Shares rose nearly 6%. It followed Takeda\u2019s revelation that although the board of Shire had rejected a \u00a344bn offer, talks with the company were \u201congoing\u201d. Allergan, a global company listed in New York and with its headquarters in Dublin, said it was in the early stages of considering a possible offer for Shire. It added: \u201cNo offer has been made. There can be no certainty an offer will be made nor as to the terms on which any such offer would be made. A further announcement will be made as appropriate.\u201d Later on Thursday, Allergan Chief Executive Brent Saunders decided to drop his pursuit of London-listed Shire after receiving pushback from some of his shareholders, who were concerned about the company overstretching its resources, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not be identified discussing confidential talks. Allergan then issued a second announcement stating it did not intend to make an offer for Shire. It is the latest twist in the battle to take control of Shire after Takeda said at the end of March it was considering making an offer. Updating the market on Thursday, the Japanese firm revealed Shire\u2019s board had rejected its offer, which was equivalent to \u00a346.50 a share. Shire responded with its own statement saying that the board had considered three separate offers from Takeda, unanimously rejecting them all on the grounds that they \u201csignificantly undervalue the company and Shire\u2019s growth prospects and pipeline\u201d. However, Shire suggested it would be willing to consider an improved offer: \u201cAt the board\u2019s request Shire\u2019s advisers entered into a dialogue with Takeda\u2019s advisers to discuss whether a further, more attractive, proposal may be forthcoming and to understand the basis on which such a proposal would be made. \u201cThe board and management of Shire remain committed to enhancing shareholder value and are focused on fully evaluating internal and external opportunities to maximise value for shareholders, including any further proposals from Takeda.\u201d Shire was founded in Basingstoke, Hampshire, in 1986, but the company has scaled back its presence in the UK and most of its operations are in the US. It has its headquarters in Dublin for tax purposes but is mainly from Boston. Takeda is focused on expanding overseas and initially said an acquisition of Shire would allow it to grow in its core areas of oncology, gastrointestinal and neuroscience. However, Shire announced on Monday that it was selling its oncology business to the French firm Servier for $2.4bn (\u00a31.7bn). \u201cShire\u2019s latest refusal, as well a deal to offload its oncology division, a prize asset that would have been complimentary to Takeda\u2019s portfolio, could be the final nail in the coffin of the merger,\u201d Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group, said.",

      "bodyText": "And finally, here\u2019s Nick Fletcher on today\u2019s action in the commodity market: Oil has hit a new three-and-a-half-year peak, and other commodity prices \u2013 notably nickel and aluminium \u2013 moved sharply higher as Donald Trump\u2019s sanctions and the continuing conflict in Syria fuelled fears of supply shortages. Brent crude rose 1.7% to $74.74 (\u00a352.67) a barrel on Thursday, the highest level since November 2014 when oil group Opec began increasing production to protect its market share, a move that subsequently led to a supply glut and a price slump to $27 a barrel just over a year later. More recently Opec had agreed with Russia, another major supplier, to cap output and protect prices, even though growing production from US shale companies threatened to undermine this strategy. However a surprise drop in US oil inventories this week, along with concerns about Middle Eastern supply following the military strikes on Syria by the US, the UK and France, have kept crude prices buoyant. Meanwhile, ahead of an Opec meeting on Friday, Reuters reported that Saudi Arabia wanted to see prices as high as $100 a barrel. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: \u201cFriday sees a host of energy ministers from some of the most influential oil producing nations meet in the Saudi city of Jeddah, heightening anticipation of what could be yet another production freeze/cut extension in the offing.\u201d More here: Goodnight! GW At the risk of being cynical.... Saudi Arabia do have a particular motive to keep the oil price high - the impending flotation of energy giant Aramco. If crude is trading at three-year highs, Saudi might get a better price from investors for a stake in its domestic operator. But the team at FXPro say traders should be cautious, in case the stratgy changes: The main focus today is on oil prices, which, since late 2014, have continued to rise to new heights. Saudi Arabia announced their desire to see the prices reach $80-100 per barrel on Wednesday, causing oil to jump $2 (3%) to $73.40. Saudi Arabia\u2019s comments were seen as an intent to continue limiting oil production, although oil stores are currently close to the 5-year average. It\u2019s worth mentioning that Saudi Arabia plans to sell a 5% stake in their largest oil company, Saudi Aramco, and launch the biggest IPO in history, valued at $100Bln. Higher oil prices would likely increase demand for these shares, providing the opportunity to earn more money. Nevertheless, this pre-sale price pumping tactic could easily turn into a time bomb. After the deal, Saudi Arabia could return to the strategy they used in 2014, refusing to balance supply and pushing prices to multi-year lows by increasing output. Nickel continues to post strong gains, due to that speculation about new US sanctions on Russian metal producers. Fiona Cincotta, Senior Market Analyst at City Index, says: Aluminium is at a 6-year high, up 32% just this month, whilst nickel has surged 20% this week alone as concerns over Russian sanctions and supply issues dominate. It\u2019s official: Allergan says it is \u201cin the early stages of considering a possible offer for Shire\u201d. It adds: No offer has been made. There can be no certainty an offer will be made nor as to the terms on which any such offer would be made. A further announcement will be made as appropriate. So the City might get one of its favourite things - a takeover battle, between Takedo and Allergan to take control of Shire, whose shares are now 9% higher #developing The Shire takeover battle takes another twist! Over in Washington, INF chief Christine Lagarde has been channelling JFK as she urges world leaders to take advantage of the current relative calm: The IMF is particularly concerned about America, and Donald Trump\u2019s plan to cut taxes and boost the US deficit [the equivalent of ignoring that leak in the attic, and splashing out on a new swimming pool instead] Oil is continuing to climb, with Brent now trading at $74.40 per barrel. That\u2019s a gain of 1% today, and its highest level since last 2014. Traders are citing recent falls in oil inventories, and signs that Opec members such as Saudi Arabia will continue to rein in production to prevent prices falling. This chart shows how prices picked up after Opec agree to curb supplies in 2016. America\u2019s jobs market continues to sizzle. The number of US citizens filing new claims for unemployment benefit fell to 232,000 last week, from 233,000. That suggests that job creation and retention remains strong, with the labor market close to full employment. Now we have a statement from Shire... confirming that it has rejected Takeda\u2019s advances. But significantly, Shire also says the two sides are still talking, suggesting a takeover is still possible. The company says it has: \u201centered into a dialogue with Takeda\u2019s advisers to discuss whether a further, more attractive, proposal may be forthcoming and to understand the basis on which such a proposal would be made. The Board and management of Shire remain committed to enhancing shareholder value and are focused on fully evaluating internal and external opportunities to maximise value for shareholders, including any further proposals from Takeda. Shares in Shire have now dropped back to \u00a338.98, leaving them around 3.7% higher today. Newsflash: Takeda has confirmed that it has approached Shire with a takeover bid -- but its advances was rejected. In a statement to the City, the Japanese pharma firm says it suggested buying Shire for \u00a346.50 per share -- \u00a317.75 in cash (US dollars) and \u00a328.75 of new Takeda shares. However, Shire\u2019s board rejected the proposal. However, this story isn\u2019t over! Takeda says that discussions between the two sides are \u2018ongoing\u2019, suggesting another offer could come before next Wednesday\u2019s deadline. Takeda insists that it will \u201cremain disciplined\u201d over any formal offer -- a nod to Shire shareholders not to expect the moon on a stick. As previously stated, Takeda intends to maintain its well-established dividend policy and investment grade credit rating. Takeda also argues that merger with Irish-headquartered Shire would make sense: Building on Takeda\u2019s existing momentum, the acquisition of Shire would accelerate its transformation and result in a global, value-based, R&amp;D-driven biopharmaceutical leader headquartered in Japan, with a balanced geographic footprint, a robust, modality-diverse pipeline and enhanced financial strength. Back in the City, shares in pharmaceutical firm Shire has jumped almost 7% as traders anticipate a takeover battle. Reuters is reporting that Japanese firm Takeda Pharmaceuticals has made an \u2018indicative takeover proposal\u2019 for Shire - which produces the ADHD drug Adderall - worth \u00a343bn, or \u00a346.50 per share. Last month, Takeda said it was considering making an offer for Shire, so the City has been waiting for the next move. Under takeover rules, Takeda has until 25 April to bid, or walk away. Shire was founded in Hampshire, but is now based in Ireland for tax purposes. Takeda is particularly interested in its rare diseases portfolio, where it has 40 programmes in its drug pipeline. Shire are currently up 256p at \u00a340.12, to the top of the FTSE 100 leaderboard. Russia has launched an attempt to win compensation over America\u2019s new tariffs on steel and aluminium. Moscow has filed an official complaint to the World Trade Organisation, arguing that the 25% tariff on steel, and 10% on aluminium, are \u2018safeguard measures\u2019 - ie, designed to protect the US economy, not for national security. That\u2019s an important distinction - as major exporters can ask for compensation under WTO rules if they are penalised by such safeguards. As Russia puts it: Although the United States presented the measures at issue as being adopted to address the threat that imports of steel and aluminium pose to the US national security, they are in essence safeguard measures, and the Agreement on Safeguards and Article XIX of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 (GATT 1994) are applicable to them. The United States did not provide notification under paragraph 1(c) of Article 12 of the Agreement on Safeguards on taking a decision to apply the safeguard measures to the WTO Committee on Safeguards. The Russian Federation is a WTO Member that has a substantial interest as exporter of the products subject to the safeguard measures. Therefore, the Russian Federation requests consultations with the United States under paragraph 3 of Article 12 of the Agreement on Safeguards and paragraph 2 of Article XIX of the GATT 1994. So, Russia now joins China, India and the EU in opposing these tariffs: Lisa Hooker, consumer markets leader at PwC, says the 1.2% fall in retail sales last month is disappointing - but there are some reasons for optimism: \u201cWith snow and rain right through March including in the critical run up to Easter, it\u2019s no surprise that shoppers avoided the high street. So, while online retailers benefited to some extent, last month\u2019s retail sales were particularly disappointing. \u201cFootfall was significantly impacted by the weather, and the first of retailers\u2019 spring/summer fashion and home product ranges would have been of little consolation to shoppers looking to stay warm. \u201cBut, it\u2019s not all doom and gloom. This week, we\u2019ve already seen evidence of wages growing in real terms as inflation has eased. Moreover, our most recent survey* shows that consumer sentiment is recovering and is higher than it was both in December and this time last year. This is particularly true of younger people, with more under 45s saying they think they\u2019ll be better off next year. Keith Richardson, managing director retail sector at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking, also blames the icy blast of grim weather for keeping shoppers off the streets. \u201cWhile Mother\u2019s Day and an early Easter provided some respite for retailers in March, the impact of two Beasts from the East was brutal. \u201cThe high street felt the worst of the chill as shoppers simply stayed at home to avoid the snow. But it wasn\u2019t just the weather to blame. \u201cFashion clearly suffered as nobody wants to buy spring clothing during a blizzard, even from the comfort of their sofa. Economist Rupert Seggins says the retail sector will have a slight negative impact on growth in the last quarter: Economics journalist Dharshini David says the weak spending figures might deter the Bank of England from raising interest rates next month: Rhian Murphy, ONS Senior Statistician, says the wintery weather in March hurt Britain\u2019s high street stores, but boosted web retailers: \u201cRetail sales fell in the first quarter due to a large decline in March with petrol sales seeing a significant slump as a result of the poor weather keeping many shoppers indoors. However, the snow actually helped boost online spending with department stores in particular seeing growth in their web sales. \u201cVarious shops also reported increased spending on gifts in the run-up to Easter and Mother\u2019s Day, which also helped boost online sales.\u201d Newsflash: UK retail sales suffered an unexpectedly sharp fall last month, as the Beast from the East hit the sector. Sales volumes fell by 1.2% on March, much worse than the 0.5% which economists had expected. The Office for National Statistics blames bad weather for the decline - backing up what Debenhams reported this morning. The figures also show that Britain has suffered its weakest quarter for retail sales in a year, with volumes down 0.5% in January-March. The ONS says: In the three months to March 2018 (Quarter 1), the quantity bought in retail sales fell by 0.5% when compared with Quarter 4 (Oct to Dec) 2017, with declines in all sectors except for department stores and non-store retailing. The month-on-month growth rate fell by 1.2% due to a large fall of 7.4% from petrol sales; a likely consequence of adverse weather conditions, which impacted travel. Department stores were the only sector to show positive growth in March at 0.8%, with feedback from retailers suggesting that online offers for Mothering Sunday and Easter boosted internet sales more than usual during the adverse weather. The quantity bought in supermarket stores declined in March, while specialist food stores saw strong growth; possibly due to the easier access to these stores during snow. Reaction to follow... Here\u2019s Reuters\u2019s take on how the nickel price has soared as investors anticipate new sanctions on Russian metal producers: Nickel surged more than nine percent on Thursday to its strongest level since late 2014 on fears U.S. sanctions on major Russian aluminium producer Rusal may be broadened and could hit key Russian nickel supplier Nornickel. It was the second straight session of sharp gains for nickel, adding to Wednesday\u2019s 7.5-percent spike, spurred by worries over tighter global supply for a commodity already in deficit. Three-month nickel on the London Metal Exchange rallied as much as 9.3% percent to $16,690 a tonne, the highest since December, 2014. The metal, used to make stainless steel, was up 7.3 percent at $16,395 by 0702 GMT. \u201cPretty clearly there is a lot of smoke. And pretty clearly the U.S. has Russia in its sights for a number of reasons known to them,\u201d said UBS analyst Lachlan Shaw. \u201cA logical extension would be if you were to broaden sanctions, then Norilsk would fall under that remit.\u201d Russia\u2019s Norilsk Nickel, or Nornickel, is the world\u2019s second-biggest nickel producer. An official for Nornickel this week dismissed the idea of the prospect of sanctions on the company driving up the nickel price. The FTSE 100 has hit a 10-week high, as the commodity rally pushes up shares in mining giants and oil producers. The Footsie is up 17 points at 7334, as it recovers from last month\u2019s selloff. Energy and raw materials companies are leading the way, with Anglo American up 1.6% and Royal Dutch Shell gaining 0.5%. Over in the City, shares in Debenhams have slumped by 10% to its lowest level since the 2008 financial crisis. Traders are unimpressed by its latest financial results, showing an 85% slump in pre-tax profits and a warning that full-year earnings will be lower than many brokers expected. The company also blamed the \u2018Beast from the East\u2019 for hitting sales in March, saying it had to close almost 100 stores as icy, snowy weather gripped the UK. That followed on from a disappointing Christmas, which had already prompted a profits warning in January. Debs says it is accelerating its \u201cDebenhams Redesigned\u201d strategy - an attempt to boost digital sales, cut costs, and lure more customers through the doors by billing shopping as a \u201cfun leisure activity\u201d. But...finance director Matt Smith isn\u2019t hanging around to see the results - he\u2019s moving to Selfridges. Lee Wild, head of equity strategy at interactive investor, says Saudi Arabia is pushing for a high oil price to prop up its fiscal plans: Despite the influence of US shale, Saudi Arabia still calls the shots on global oil markets, and it\u2019s increasingly obvious the Saudi\u2019s are comfortable with oil at $80 or more. Add a drop in weekly US oil reserves to the mix and the only way for crude prices is up. Saudi bullishness should be no surprise given it must somehow bankroll Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman\u2019s expensive reforms and modernisation at home. Even lumber is being swept higher by the surge in commodity prices: The rubber price has, umm, bounced by 5% today, after China announced temporary anti-dumping measures on imports. The measures will affect halogenated butyl rubber imported from the United States, European Union and Singapore, Reuters reports The surge in commodity prices this month is quite astonishing: Shares in Australia\u2019s mining sector has hit a three-month high this morning, following the rally in commodity prices: Oil isn\u2019t the only commodity to rally today. Nickel has surged by 9% this morning, hitting its highest level since December 2014. That follows reports that Russian mining firm Norilsk Nickel could be caught up in US sanctions against Moscow. That could have serious consequences for manufacturers, as nickel is a key component in rechargeable batteries used in mobile phones and electric cars, for example. Earlier this month the US imposed sanctions on aluminium-producer United Co. Rusal. That has caused drama in the commodities markets, with aluminium up another 5% today. Bloomberg explains: Consumers, manufacturers and traders are scrambling to secure supply cut off by Rusal, the largest aluminum producer outside China. Aluminum reached a six-year high and nickel jumped the most intraday since 2009. Alumina, a raw material needed to make aluminum, notched a fresh record. \u201cIt really is unprecedented in terms of the turmoil it\u2019s unleashed,\u201d Robin Bhar, a metals analyst at Societe Generale SA, said by phone from London. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing to watch.\u201d Hussein Sayed, Chief Market Strategist at FXTM, agrees that supply worries and geopolitical tensions are pushing oil up: Oil found support after data from the Energy Information Administration showed that crude inventories dropped 1.1 million barrels in the week to 13 April, while gasoline and distillate stockpiles fell by more than 3 million barrels. Now it is OPEC and Co.\u2019s turn to capitalize on the bullish report as they meet in Jeddah on Friday. While the elimination of oversupply has been a critical factor pushing oil prices, I still believe there\u2019s a significant risk premium being priced in, specifically the fear of supply disruption from the Middle East and possible renewed sanctions on Russia and Iran. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The oil price is on a tear this morning, hitting its highest levels since late 2014 as stockpiles fall and worries about geopolitical tensions in the Middle East weigh on the markets. Brent crude has crashed over the $74 per barrel mark this morning, following data yesterday showing a surprise drop in US oil inventories. US crude (West Texas Intermediate) is also rising, hitting a three-year high of $68.95. Last week\u2019s US-UK-French military strikes in Syria have also pushed oil prices higher, amid worries that supplies from the region could be disrupted. In addition, a Reuters report that Saudi Arabia is pushing for higher prices -- perhaps even $100 per barrel -- has caught traders attention. It may show that the Opec cartel will push on with its supply curbs, to keep prices buoyant. Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group says: Traders are starting to get excited that the oil market is finally rebalancing with the global supply glut evaporating. Whilst it may be premature for the OPEC led group implementing supply cuts to cheer, the numbers are certainly pointing to a potential end in sight. Also coming up today... We get a new healthcheck on Britain\u2019s retail sector, with sales figures for March released this morning. Economists predict that they fell by 0.5% month-on-month, as grim weather kept shoppers away from the high streets. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets says: Today\u2019s retail sales numbers for March could shatter the perception of consumers feeling a little better about their spending habits. So far this year consumers have been in a fairly cautious mood with retail sales in January and February rising 0.1% and 0.8% respectively. This morning\u2019s March numbers could reverse all or most of these gains with expectations of a decline of 0.5%. High street chain Debenhams, broadcaster Sky and pest control firm Rentokil are also reporting to the City. The news from Debenhams isn\u2019t great - pre-tax profits slumped by almost 85% in the last six months: Sky has reported a 5% rise in like-for-like revenues, and are speaking to the press now....

Saudi Arabia announced their desire to see the prices reach $80-100 per barrel on Wednesday, causing oil to jump $2 (3%) to $73.40. Saudi Arabia\u2019s comments were seen as an intent to continue limiting oil production, although oil stores are currently close to the 5-year average.<br></p> <p>It\u2019s worth mentioning that Saudi Arabia plans to sell a 5% stake in their largest oil company, Saudi Aramco, and launch the biggest IPO in history, valued at $100Bln. Higher oil prices would likely increase demand for these shares, providing the opportunity to earn more money.</p> <p>Nevertheless, this pre-sale price pumping tactic could easily turn into a time bomb. After the deal, Saudi Arabia could return to the strategy they used in 2014, refusing to balance supply and pushing prices to multi-year lows by increasing output.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5ad8aa77e4b0d4b06ccb5c4e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-04-19T14:56:54.683Z\">3.56pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Nickel continues to post strong gains, due to that speculation about new US sanctions on Russian metal producers.</strong></p> <p>Fiona Cincotta, Senior Market Analyst at <a href=\"http://www.cityindex.co.uk/\">City Index</a>, says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Aluminium is at a 6-year high, up 32% just this month, whilst nickel has surged 20% this week alone as concerns over Russian sanctions and supply issues dominate.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/jsblokland/status/986848807148236800\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Commodity?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Commodity</a> prices are spiking everywhere. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Nickel?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Nickel</a> is up 18% in the last 5 trading days! <a href=\"https://t.co/QioOc9y9wl\">pic.twitter.com/QioOc9y9wl</a></p>&mdash; jeroen blokland (@jsblokland) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jsblokland/status/986848807148236800?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 19, 2018</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2018-04-19T16:07:51.806Z\">at 5.07pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5ad8a2cae4b0d4b06ccb5bc5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-04-19T14:54:59.491Z\">3.54pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d3a9443fe349c92f7e38df56b1bd6b06f96f0b64\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d3a9443fe349c92f7e38df56b1bd6b06f96f0b64/0_0_3500_2334/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange today\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange today, where the Dow is down 0.2%</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brendan Mcdermid/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5ad8a6f0e4b096a5b0266a10\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-04-19T14:26:58.842Z\">3.26pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>It\u2019s official: Allergan says it is \u201cin the early stages of considering a possible offer for Shire\u201d.</strong></p> <p>It adds:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>No offer has been made.

      "bodyText": "Retail sales fell steeply in March owing to a slump in petrol sales when the \u201cbeast from the east\u201d hit Britain. Volume of sales fell 1.2% in March from February, with petrol sales down 7.4%, the Office for National Statistics said. The ONS blamed the slump on the cold spell, when large parts of the UK were brought to a standstill by heavy snow and bitter cold weather. Analysts had been expecting a decline of 0.5%. Sales were down 0.5% between January and March compared with the previous quarter, the worst performance in a year. Rhian Murphy, ONS senior statistician, said: \u201cRetail sales fell in the first quarter due to a large decline in March with petrol sales seeing a significant slump as a result of the poor weather keeping many shoppers indoors. However, the snow actually helped boost online spending with department stores in particular seeing growth in their web sales. \u201cVarious shops also reported increased spending on gifts in the run-up to Easter and Mother\u2019s Day, which also helped boost online sales.\u201d The department store sector was the only one to enjoy sales growth in March at 0.8%. Online offers for Mother\u2019s Day and Easter led to greater internet sales than usual during the cold wave, the ONS said. Food stores and non-food stores both posted declines of 0.6% last month. Within food stores, supermarket sales fell while specialist food stores such as butchers, bakers, fishmongers and convenience stores posted strong growth as they were easier to get to during the snow. Clothing retailers experienced a 0.7% fall. Sales in household goods stores slipped 0.2% while those in other stores such as jewellers and bookshops dropped 1.8%. The forecasting group EY Item Club said the figures suggested GDP growth slowed to 0.3% at best in the first quarter of this year, and could well have been as low as 0.2%. But it believes this is unlikely to deter the Bank of England from raising interest rates from 0.5% to 0.75% in May, even though it comes after inflation weakened to a one-year low of 2.5% in March. Howard Archer, EY Item Club\u2019s chief economic adviser, said: \u201cThe monetary policy committee expected the economy to take a hit in the first quarter from the severe weather and sees a bounce back in activity in the second quarter. It is also keen to gradually normalise monetary policy.\u201d Samuel Tombs, the chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: \u201cSales should rebound in April as people jumped back in their cars and finally started to buy spring clothing.\u201d However, he added: \u201cHouseholds also have adopted a more cautious mindset in recent months, having thrown caution to the wind last year. Savings intentions have increased to their highest level since September 2008, according to GfK\u2019s consumer confidence survey, suggesting that retailers won\u2019t benefit much from the forthcoming modest recovery in real wages. In short, consumers still are not in a position to drive the economy strongly forwards.\u201d Department store group Debenhams reported an 85% slump in pre-tax profits on Thursday, after the \u201cbeast from the east\u201d forced the retailer to temporarily shut almost 100 stores.",

      "bodyText": "The shape of the four-finger KitKat bar is set to lose its EU-wide protected trademark status after the European court of justice was instructed that the chocolate was not well enough known in Belgium, Ireland, Greece and Portugal. An appeal by Nestle\u0301, the maker of KitKat, against an earlier ruling should now be thrown out, the court\u2019s advocate general advised judges sitting in the Luxembourg court. The company had only provided evidence that the chocolate was sufficiently well known in Denmark, Germany, Spain, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Austria, Finland, Sweden and the UK, the advocate general, Melchior Wathelet, said. For the trademark to be valid the KitKat would need to be recognised as distinctive across all the EU\u2019s states, as had been ruled by the general court, the second highest in the EU, in 2016. The decision by the advocate general, whose advice is not binding but is generally followed, means the KitKat shape will now be open to imitation by competitors. It follows a decision by appeal judges in the UK in favour of stripping KitKat of its UK-only trademark on the basis that the three-dimensional shape of a chocolate product had \u201cno inherent distinctiveness\u201d. The appeal court heard then that that Nestl\u00e9 had spent between \u00a33m and \u00a311m a year advertising and promoting KitKats between 1996 and 2007. More than 40m were sold in Britain in 2010. The legal skirmish in the European court of justice is part of a wider battle between Nestle\u0301 and Mondel\u0113z International, previously known as Cadbury Schweppes, which filed the original challenge to the EU trademark in 2007, a year after it had been granted. Nestl\u00e9, in turn, is challenging Mondel\u0113z\u2019s British trademark for the shade of purple wrapper on its Cadbury\u2019s Dairy Milk chocolate bars. The EU intellectual property office was said to have erred in law when it granted trademark status to the four-finger shape in 2006. Nestle\u0301 has not sought such a status for its two-finger bar. A spokesman for Nestl\u00e9 said: \u201cWe believe his [Wathelet\u2019s] final conclusion is based on incorrect factual findings. Nestl\u00e9 did submit sufficient evidence to prove acquired distinctiveness of its iconic KitKat four fingers shape to meet the advocate general\u2019s proposed threshold, including in the few countries where evidence was challenged.\u201d Gaining trademark status for shapes has proven to be particularly challenging for companies. In 2016 the Rubik\u2019s Cube lost a decade-long battle to secure trademark protection for its own distinctive character. However, Toblerone, which is owned by Mondel\u0113z, has successfully trademarked its \u201czigzag prism\u201d shape.",

      "bodyText": "More than half of the world\u2019s wealthiest investors expect to live to the age of 100, according to a survey. UBS wealth management polled 5,000 high-net worth individuals (HNWIs), defined as having at least $1m in investable assets, across 10 countries including Germany, the UK, US and Taiwan, and found that 53% were confident of becoming centenarians. This is considerably higher than the 80-year life expectancy in most developed countries. The UBS report, entitled The Century Club, concluded: \u201cThe idea of living a century was once confined to science fiction. But no longer. For the world\u2019s wealthy, living a 100-year life is not an outcome they consider a mere possibility. It\u2019s one they expect.\u201d The richest 1% own half the world\u2019s wealth, according to a report by Credit Suisse in November, which highlighted the growing gap between the super-rich and the remainder of the globe\u2019s population. Numerous studies have provided evidence that wealth inequality is linked to health inequality. Last year, data compiled by the Department of Health showed that in the UK the gap between rich and poor in relation to \u201chealthy life expectancy\u201d \u2013 defined as a life free of disease or disability \u2013 had widened to almost 20 years. A University of Washington study in the US in 2017 came to a similar conclusion on a \u201clife expectancy gap\u201d between affluent and poorer areas of at least 20 years. UBS found that the outlook for longevity varies by country and wealth. Three-quarters of Germany\u2019s wealthy elite anticipate reaching 100 while less than a third of HNWIs in the US believe they will live that long. In Switzerland, Mexico and Italy the figure is more than two-thirds. In the UK, nearly a third (32%) expect to reach the age of 100. However, even the wealthy worry about having enough money to pay for healthcare when they are older, according to UBS. There is more appetite to work longer and to spend less today to save for tomorrow, amid concerns about how to pay for end of life care. Healthcare costs are the greatest concern among those surveyed by UBS, with 52% worried about rising medical bills. In addition, 35% worry about having less wealth to pass on to their children, and 33% fret about being forced to work longer to maintain their lifestyle. At the same time, nearly eight in 10 believe that work is important for their wellbeing. This belief is particularly strong in Asia (93% in Hong Kong), and in Switzerland (87%), but far less so in the US and the UK, where the figures are 52% and 59% respectively. Nine in 10 say their health is more important than increasing their wealth and a similar number believe their wealth enables them to live a healthier life. Those with more than $10m spend four times more on health than their less wealthy peers. Ultra-high net-worth individuals with $50m-plus claim they would part with nearly half their riches in exchange for an extra 10 years of healthy life. UAE investors are the most likely to sacrifice more while US investors are the least likely. The longer they live, the quicker the wealthy are going to give away their riches; and the more likely they are to skip a generation and give wealth to their grandchildren rather than their children. Nearly two in three plan to give away more of their wealth while they are still alive to see heirs enjoy it, especially in Switzerland but less so in Mexico and the US, where people worry about outliving their assets.",

      "bodyText": "Debenhams is to cut the size of at least 30 stores as it blamed \u201cprofound change\u201d in shopping habits and bad weather for an 85% slump in pre-tax profits. The department store group said sales at established stores declined 2.2%, or 2.8% at constant currencies, in the 26 weeks to 3 March, against a challenging UK market background. Underlying sales in the UK slid 4.1% as the \u201cbeast from the east\u201d forced the retailer to temporarily shut almost 100 stores. The temporary closures during the final week of the six-month period, when large parts of the UK were brought to a standstill by heavy snow and bitter cold weather, accounted for about a 1% fall in underlying sales in the first half. Digital sales fared better, rising 9.7%. Pre-tax profit slumped to \u00a313.5m, from \u00a387.8m in the same period a year earlier, a decline of 84.6%. The pre-tax figure includes an exceptional charge of \u00a328.7m relating to the cost of a strategic review and restructuring the company\u2019s warehouse and logistics operation. Excluding these extra costs, underlying profit before tax was \u00a342.2m, down 51.9%. Debenhams admitted that for the full year, profit before tax was expected to be at the lower end of forecasts of \u00a350m to \u00a361m. Debenhams\u2019 share price fell as much as 10% in early trading but by late morning it had recovered nearly all its losses for the day. The share price has fallen by a third since the beginning of the year. It slumped 20% on the day in early January when Debenhams issued an unexpected profit warning owing to poor Christmas trading. The Debenhams chief executive, Sergio Bucher, said: \u201cA combination of a disappointing Christmas and structural change in the market means it has not been an easy half year.\u201d He admitted that Debenhams\u2019 products had not been good enough at Christmas and the company was revamping its fashion ranges, ending collaborations with Jeff Banks and John Rocha and bringing in a new line by Richard Quinn. \u201cThe UK retail environment is undergoing profound change ... We expect no help from the external environment, so we are focused on delivering our Debenhams redesigned strategy, aiming to mitigate difficult trading conditions through self\u2010help initiatives,\u201d Bucher said. The retailer is talking to landlords about reducing space at 30 stores as shoppers switch to buying online. Cutting the size of its Uxbridge site in west London by a fifth improved profits and there are plans to shrink the Wimbledon store by nearly a third this year. Debenhams said 25 stores were up for lease renewal in the next five years, giving it an opportunity to renegotiate rents or potentially move out. It has identified eight stores that could potentially close, on top of two that shut last year, but Bucher said the focus was on reducing store size. As clothing sales continue to shrink, Debenhams is handing over space to restaurants and other food businesses and planning to revamp its beauty halls to bring in more services such as blow-dry bars. \u201cThe high street needs to embrace shopping as leisure activity,\u201d said Bucher. But he added that government could also help the high street, which is suffering from mass store closures and administrations. \u201cPaying taxes is something we all should be proud of as we all deserve great healthcare ... [but] the government is responsible to make sure we have an even playing field. Right now business rates give an unfair advantage to online pure-play competitors and that needs to be addressed.\u201d The group\u2019s chief financial officer, Matt Smith, is leaving after less than three years in the job for rival Selfridges, where he will become finance director.",

    "webTitle": "Researchers create super sponge that mops up oil spills", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Oil spills could be soaked up by a new floating substance that combines waste from the petroleum industry and cooking oil, according to new research led by South Australia\u2019s Flinders University. The new polymer, made from sulphur and canola cooking oil, acted like a sponge to remove crude oil and diesel from seawater, according to a new study published in the Advanced Sustainable Systems journal. The polymer can be squeezed to remove the oil and then reused. The lead researcher, Dr Justin Chalker, said it had the potential to be a cheap and sustainable recovery tool in areas affected by oil spills. \u201cWe anticipate that when we get to economies of scale we will be able to compete in price with other materials that are used to soak up oil,\u201d said Chalker, senior lecturer in synthetic chemistry at Flinders University. \u2022 Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon \u201cOur goal is for this to be used globally. It is inexpensive, and we have an eye for it to be used in parts of the world such as the Amazon Basin in Ecuador and the Niger Delta that don\u2019t have access to solutions to oil spills.\u201d The International Tanker Owners Pollution Federation says about 7,000 tonnes of crude oil were spilt into oceans last year. The BP Deepwater Horizon explosion in 2010, which released 4.9m barrels of crude oil into the Gulf of Mexico, prompted new research efforts but large spills continue. The Indonesian port city of Balikpapan, part of the island of Borneo, declared a state of emergency after a spill along the coast earlier this month.
