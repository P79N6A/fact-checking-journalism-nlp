      "bodyText": "A late PS.... Could Germany be heading for new elections? Philip Oltermann reports from Berlin: Angela Merkel has indicated that she would rather have fresh elections than try to rule in a minority government as the collapse of German coalition talks posed the most serious threat to her power since she became chancellor more than a decade ago. Merkel, who has headed three coalitions since 2005, said she was \u201cvery sceptical\u201d about ruling in a minority government and suggested she would stand again as a candidate if elections were called in the new year, telling public broadcaster ARD she was \u201ca woman who has responsibility and is prepared to take responsibility in the future\u201d. More here: Time for a recap. European investors are bracing for fresh upheaval after Germany\u2019s coalition talks collapsed overnight. With Angela Merkel\u2019s position as chancellor looking less secure, analyst are predicting further volatility \u2013 and possibly losses in the weeks ahead. Right now, the euro has lost 0.3% against the US dollar, to $1.176. It has also lost ground against the pound, which is up 0.6% at \u20ac1.127. The markets were jittery after Germany\u2019s Free Democrats walked out of \u2018Jamaica coalition talks\u2019 with Merkel\u2019s CDU/CSU bloc, and the Green party. As things stand, there seem to be three outcomes 1) Merkel tries to govern in a minority government, perhaps with support from the centre-left Social Democrats 2) Fresh elections are held, likely early next year 3) The FDP return to negotiations. President Steinmeier has urged all sides to act responsibly, saying they have a responsibility to do their best to ensure Germany has a stable government. The ball is now in Steinmeier\u2019s court; he must recommend a candidate to be chancellor, which MPs in the Bundestag will vote on. Here\u2019s what might happen next. After suffering early losses, European stock markets are are little higher this afternoon. The possibility that Angela Merkel might not govern as chancellor for several more years has caused some head-scratching in the City. It could make it harder for her to offer Brexit concessions to the UK, or to support French president Emmanuel Macron\u2019s push for European reforms. Wolfgang Bauer, fixed income fund manager at M&amp;G Investments, says the outcome of the German crisis will drive markets in the weeks ahead. If the grand coalition was to be renegotiated and went ahead, this would mean political stability in Germany and support for risk assets like equities and corporate bonds. I expect that the SPD would be able to push through more of their agenda and this might mean further steps towards European integration, reaching out to Macron. If however negotiations between CDU/CSU and SPD fail and we are heading towards a minority government or even snap elections, I would expect to see market volatility increase due to rising political uncertainty in Europe\u2019s economic powerhouse. It would be less likely that any major European integration projects would be pushed forward for the foreseeable future. It is important to note that the tail risk remains and currently it does not seem to be priced in.\u201d A clip of Frank-Walter Steinmeier speaking this lunchtime, complete with subtitles for English readers: Teneo Intelligence have kindly sent over an explanation of how Germany\u2019s political system will proceed, following the breakdown of the \u2018Jamaica coalition talks\u2019 last night. A Bundestag vote is the next step As a lesson from the Weimar days, the Bundestag cannot dissolve itself. Neither can Merkel unilaterally provoke early elections via a confidence question. After all, the newly elected Bundestag has never expressed its confidence in Merkel in the first place; she currently serves merely as caretaker. Therefore, the next step is necessarily the attempt to elect a chancellor in the Bundestag. There is no time limit, but Steinmeier must eventually propose to MPs a candidate he deems best placed to win support in the Bundestag \u2013 this remains likely to be Merkel, lead candidate of the strongest parliamentary group. Without any coalition agreement in place, she will not receive the required support of an absolute majority of all MPs (355 out of 709) in the first round of voting. 14 day deadline, caretaker government, and Europe In consequence, a 14-day deadline kicks in during which this vote could (theoretically) be repeated multiple times. This, however, is likely only if, for instance, the SPD were to change its mind and opt for another grand coalition. In the meantime, Merkel and her grand coalition cabinet continue to serve as caretakers. Hopes in the UK for a political deal with Berlin on Brexit were unrealistic before but have now become even less likely. The EU\u2019s negotiation guidelines, including the need to pay a sufficient amount of money in the run-up to the December European Council, are still the basis for any deal, now more than ever. Eurozone build-out jointly with France remains a task for the next government, but conversations will remain on ice until the deadlock in Berlin has been broken. How to dissolve parliament and hold snap elections Absent such developments, however, another round of voting must be held within 14 days of the first round. This time, a plurality of votes is sufficient for a candidate to be elected chancellor (i.e., the candidate who receives the largest number of votes is elected). It is then up to the federal president to decide, within seven days, whether to appoint the elected candidate on the basis of this plurality vote. The result would be a minority government. The alternative option for the president is to dissolve the Bundestag and call early elections. These would have to be held within 60 days of the dissolution of parliament. As a result, mid-February would be the earliest possible date for snap polls. The exact timeframe, however, depends on how quickly Steinmeier proceeds in the coming days towards proposing a candidate for chancellor to the Bundestag. Here\u2019s a photo of German Chancellor Angela Merkel meeting with President Frank-Walter Steinmeier today. Over in Brussels, European Central Bank president Mario Draghi is testifying to MEPs. Draghi hasn\u2019t mentioned the situation in Germany in his opening statement. Instead, he argues that Europe\u2019s economic recovery is solid and broad-based, but also warns the euro area must be strengthened to help it deal with upcoming risks. As Draghi puts it: The EU Treaties gave the ECB the primary objective of maintaining price stability in the euro area as a whole. This is the best contribution we can make to the welfare of our fellow citizens. Ensuring price stability is a precondition for the euro area economy to achieve a balanced growth path that can be sustained in the long run. But this is not the only condition. Achieving a balanced growth path also requires to strengthen the euro area ability to deal with risks, whenever they will materialise. The current economic outlook provides a unique opportunity to reduce the likelihood of severe shocks by strengthening the economic structures of Member States, with policy actions both on the fiscal and structural side. At the same time, boosting the resilience of the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) implies also reinforcing our common institutional set-up so as to prevent and manage shocks. The key part of Frank-Walter Steinmeier\u2019s statement came when he urged all political parties to consider helping to form a new government. The German president said: \u201cAll political parties elected to the German parliament have an obligation to the common interest to serve our country. \u201cI expect from all a readiness to talk to make agreeing a government possible in the near future.\u201d Newsflash: German president Frank-Walter Steinmeier is delivering a statement in Berlin now, following his meeting with Angela Merkel. Steinmeier says that Germany faces an unprecedented situation, following the breakdown in coalition talks between the CDU/CSU, the FDP and the Greens. He says he expects all parties to be prepared to help find a solution. He\u2019ll be speaking to the leaders of Germany\u2019s political parties, and the heads of other institutions, to see if a government can be formed. Steinmeier also reminds Germany that the world is watching, saying it is clear that European nations would be concerned if the region\u2019s largest economy can\u2019t form a stable government. And that\u2019s it - he doesn\u2019t take any questions. Germany\u2019s Social Democrats, who came second in September\u2019s election, are sticking to their policy of not joining a grand coalition with Angela Merkel. That\u2019s according to a party document seen by Reuters, which reports: \u201cGiven the results of the Sept. 24 election, we are not available for entry into a grand coalition,\u201d read a SPD paper due to be discussed by party leaders that was obtained by Reuters. \u201cWe are not afraid of new elections.\u201d European stock markets have now recovered their earlier losses as traders await news from the Merkel-Steinmeier talks. Political analyst Nina Schick suggests the political uncertainty could last for months, though, meaning traders will remain nervous. Here\u2019s our latest report from Berlin. Angela Merkel\u2019s political difficulties could be bad news for the UK over the Brexit talks. Mihir Kapadia, CEO of Sun Global Investments, reckons it will be hard for the chancellor to give Britain any concessions, as she\u2019ll have to take a \u2018pragmatic\u2019 approach. She will be preoccupied with domestic issues and unable to assume a leadership role in the EU. She was expected to return to the European fray as the leader of Germany and push for a faster more pragmatic approach which would be more favourable to the UK. However, she will now be mired in domestic political difficulties and will not have the time or the perceived authority to take a lead in Europe. The vacuum will be filled in part by a more pro-EU stance by Mr Macron. Analysts at Citigroup say the euro is being propped up by several factors - including the lack of clarity over German politics right now. Over in Berlin, Angela Merkel arriving for a meeting with German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier at Bellevue Palace, his official residency. Merkel will brief Steinmeier about the state of the coalition talks (nicht sehr gut!). Steinmeier is then expected to give a statement around 2.30pm local time (1.30pm GMT) Euro volatility has risen this morning, suggesting that traders are more nervous about Europe\u2019s prospects. But...we\u2019re nowhere near the levels seen in April, when Emmanuel Macron and Marine Le Pen were battling for the French presidency, as this chart shows: Kathleen Brooks of City Index suggests the markets may be underestimating the risks from Germany. Volatility spiked ahead of the French election, which turned out to be a boon for markets as Emmanuel Macron was easily elected President of France. The market got the level of risk wrong back in April, and were overly worried, could they be wrong this time and be overly complacent? How this saga plays out in the coming days will be crucial for European traders. It\u2019s not beyond the realm of possibility that Germany could end up being the biggest political hot potato for the Eurozone this year. A quick reminder of the result of September\u2019s election shows why Angela Merkel is in a bind. Having only won 246 out of the 706 seats in the Bundestag, the CDU/CSU needs coalition partners to form a stable government. However, the maths is tricky, as the SPD isn\u2019t willing to join another grand coalition. That leaves four smaller parties; but ideological disagreements mean a formal deal with either the left-wing Die Linke or the far-right AfD isn\u2019t feasible. So a deal with the Greens and the the FDP was the only option. Christian Odendahl of the Centre for European Reform reckons the SPD could help prop up a minority administration. Here\u2019s a chart of the euro\u2019s sharp moves against the US dollar this morning: However, the euro is still down 0.5% against the pound, at \u20ac1.125. A flurry of headlines from Germany are helping the euro to claw back some of its earlier losses. The Free Democrats have apparently signalled that they could support a minority government made up of the CDU-CSU bloc and the Green party. FDP parliamentary director Marco Buschmann told the Bild newspaper that: \u201cIf there are good initiatives, then we are available.\u201d The prospect of Angela Merkel holding onto power seems to be reassuring investors, even though nothing is clear at this stage. Dutch foreign minister Halbe Zijlstra has warned that the collapse of German coalition talks last night is \u2018bad news\u2019 for Europe. Zijlstra told reporters in Brussels that: \u201cGermany is a very influential country within the EU so if they don\u2019t have a government and therefore don\u2019t have a mandate it\u2019ll be very hard for them to take positions.\u201d (thanks to Reuters for the quote) Peter Thal Larsen, European editor at Breakingviews, sums up the situation: Political economics professor Henrik Enderlein says Angela Merkel has been \u201cseriously weakened\u201d, with no easy way forward. The possibility that Angela Merkel could be forced out of the German Chancellery will worry the City, says Rebecca O\u2019Keeffe, head of investing at interactive investor. \u201cEuropean equity markets have picked up where they left off last week, heading lower after the FDP walked out of German coalition talks. Angela Merkel has been the glue that has held the European Union together for the past 12 years, a stable force in turbulent times. Chancellor Merkel is also one of the few European politicians who has demonstrated she may be prepared to compromise with Britain, rather than run the risk that Prime Minister May is replaced by a hardline Brexiteer. With almost unsurpassed political experience, markets will want Germany to find a quick solution, preferably one that leaves Mrs Merkel in situ. Get up to speed every day with our morning email! Ulrich Speck, senior research fellow of the Elcano Royal Institute think tank, says the collapse of the Jamaica coalition talks could be a major moment in German politics, and beyond. The pound is gaining ground against the euro this morning, up 0.25% at \u20ac1.1235. Angela Merkel will meet with Germany\u2019s president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, later today to discuss the situation. Steinmeier is a leading figure in the left-wing Social Democrat party - who came second in September\u2019s election but refused to enter another Grand Coalition. Marc Ostwald of ADM Investor Services suspects that a minority government made up of Merkel\u2019s CDU/CSU and the Green party might have decent survival prospects, as the SPD could support much of its legislative programme. He adds: As a point of historical note, there is no precedent for fresh general elections so quickly after the previous one. I would not want to second guess this situation, but with Steinmeier being president, and the risk that any or all of the CDU, SPD and FDP take a hammering if fresh elections are held, it might be the compromise outcome. Germany\u2019s DAX stock index has fallen by half a percent at the start of trading in Frankfurt. Postal operator Deutsche Post, financial group Deutsche Bank and industrial giant Thyssenkrupp are leading the fallers. But...energy provider RWE have jumped by almost 4%. That\u2019s because German\u2019s Green party would have pushed for coal-fired power plants to be shut down had they joined a coalition. Other European markets have also dipped into the red. Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at FXTM, fears that Angela Merkel\u2019s failure to form a new government could drive markets lower. With this bombshell development heightening concerns over political instability in Europe\u2019s largest economy and sparking speculation of fresh elections, the Euro may be in store for further punishment. Although Europe\u2019s encouraging macro fundamentals may offer some background support to the Euro long term, political risk has the ability to trigger further selloffs in the shorter term. Germany\u2019s coalition conundrum puts the whole future of Europe into doubt, says Dean Turner of UBS Wealth Management. He told Bloomberg TV that: The clear risk is that if Angela Merkel was not going to continue as chancellor, what would that mean for Europe? With Emmanuel Macron elected in France, the push to rebuild the Franco-German alliance, to restructure Europe and make new reforms would be put into question. The FT\u2019s Tobias Buck has a good explanation of why Merkel and the Free Democrats couldn\u2019t reach a coalition deal. Among the core differences was the issue of refugee and asylum policy and, in particular, the issue of whether refugees should be allowed to bring their families to Germany. In 2016, at the height of the Syrian refugee crisis, Berlin suspended that right. But the freeze on family reunifications runs out next year, raising the prospect of a spike in new arrivals. The Bavarian CSU, the sister party of Ms Merkel\u2019s CDU, was determined to prolong the suspension, broadly backed by the CDU and the FDP. The Greens, in contrast, insisted that refugees must be allowed to bring their spouses and children into the country, citing humanitarian reasons. Other areas of disagreement were Germany\u2019s response to climate change and the Green demand to shut down a significant number of coal-fired power plants, which are among the biggest producers of carbon dioxide emissions. Tax policy, too, was a bone of contention, with the FDP demanding a rapid phase-out of the so-called solidarity tax that is raised to fund the economic development in eastern Germany. Our correspondent in Berlin, Philip Oltermann, says Merkel\u2019s position as Germany\u2019s leader is now under scrutiny, following the collapse of coalition talks. He writes: With talks now seemingly over, Merkel could seek to form a minority government, either with the FDP or the Greens, and gather support from other parties on individual policy votes. The Social Democrat leader, Martin Schulz, whose party has played junior partner to Merkel in the German government for the past four years, ruled out the possibility of another grand coalition under his leadership. \u201cThe voter has rejected the grand coalition,\u201d Schulz said at a party conference in Nuremberg on Sunday. Once all other options are exhausted, Germany\u2019s president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, could dissolve the current parliament and call fresh elections. To get there, however, Steinmeier would need first to set into motion a complicated process that would involve a parliamentary vote on Merkel\u2019s role as interim chancellor. While the debate in Germany over the past few weeks has mainly focused on policy differences between the parties, it is likely to soon shift to the chancellor, and the question of whether or not she still commands sufficient power to hold together a strong government. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Oh Mutti! German politics has been plunged into new uncertainty overnight after Angela Merkel\u2019s attempts to form a new coalition collapsed. Overnight, the pro-market Free Democratic Party walked out of talks with Merkel\u2019s CDU-CSU group, and the leftwing Green party. Despite weeks of talks, the FDP, the CDU and the Greens weren\u2019t able to carve out an agreement on migration and climate change. This seems to have scuppered Merkel\u2019s hopes of building a \u2018Jamaica coalition\u2019, following September\u2019s election. Investors are watching with considerable interest to see how Merkel reacts. Will she try to lead a minority government, which could hamper her efforts to push through legislation on issues like refugees policy, or Brexit.... Alternatively, she could push for new elections. But that has risks too -- embroiling Germany in a second campaign with no certainty that Merkel\u2019s party would do any better than last time (when her majority fell sharply). The financial markets have already reacted, sending the euro down almost half a cent against the US dollar to \u20ac1.175. Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, says the FDP\u2019s decision to quit coalition talks could have a \u201cconsiderable impact\u201d on European politics, and the markets. \u201cNews emerging from Germany that Angela Merkel has failed to form a coalition within deadline has thrown the country into a state of political disarray for the time being, which could have a detrimental effect on the eurozone as a result. \u201cGermany is renowned for being the economic powerhouse of Europe in recent times, and has consistently contributed to its growth in the first three quarters of this year. Despite the single currency remaining strong for now and the eurozone stimulus programme going to plan, the ECB may choose to approach the situation in Germany with caution until political matters becomes clearer. The German stock market is also expected to drop this morning, as traders in Frankfurt brace for more turmoil. German politics may hog the spotlight today, as there\u2019s not much else in the calendar. ECB president Mario Draghi will give his views on the state of the eurozone after lunch, when he appears before the European Parliament Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. In the UK, we\u2019ll be enjoying the build-up to Philip Hammond\u2019s budget on Wednesday. The agenda 2pm GMT: European Central Bank president Mario Draghi testifies to the European Parliament 6.30pm: Bank of England deputy governor David Ramsden gives a speech at King\u2019s College London.",

Neither can Merkel unilaterally provoke early elections via a confidence question. After all, the newly elected Bundestag has never expressed its confidence in Merkel in the first place; she currently serves merely as caretaker.</p> <p>Therefore, the next step is necessarily the attempt to elect a chancellor in the Bundestag. There is no time limit, but Steinmeier must eventually propose to MPs a candidate he deems best placed to win support in the Bundestag \u2013 this remains likely to be Merkel, lead candidate of the strongest parliamentary group. Without any coalition agreement in place, she will not receive the required support of an absolute majority of all MPs (355 out of 709) in the first round of voting.</p> <h2><strong>14 day deadline, caretaker government, and Europe</strong></h2> <p>In consequence, a 14-day deadline kicks in during which this vote could (theoretically) be repeated multiple times. This, however, is likely only if, for instance, the SPD were to change its mind and opt for another grand coalition.</p> <p>In the meantime, Merkel and her grand coalition cabinet continue to serve as caretakers. Hopes in the UK for a political deal with Berlin on Brexit were unrealistic before but have now become even less likely. The EU\u2019s negotiation guidelines, including the need to pay a sufficient amount of money in the run-up to the December European Council, are still the basis for any deal, now more than ever. Eurozone build-out jointly with France remains a task for the next government, but conversations will remain on ice until the deadlock in Berlin has been broken.</p> <h2><strong>How to dissolve parliament and hold snap elections</strong></h2> <p>Absent such developments, however, another round of voting must be held within 14 days of the first round. This time, a plurality of votes is sufficient for a candidate to be elected chancellor (i.e., the candidate who receives the largest number of votes is elected). It is then up to the federal president to decide, within seven days, whether to appoint the elected candidate on the basis of this plurality vote. The result would be a minority government. The alternative option for the president is to dissolve the Bundestag and call early elections. These would have to be held within 60 days of the dissolution of parliament.</p> <p>As a result, mid-February would be the earliest possible date for snap polls. The exact timeframe, however, depends on how quickly Steinmeier proceeds in the coming days towards proposing a candidate for chancellor to the Bundestag. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a12e93baa484106f489b50c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-11-20T14:40:57.901Z\">2.40pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here\u2019s a photo of German Chancellor Angela Merkel meeting with President Frank-Walter Steinmeier today.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d41a26b71788dd72ec8ddd44cc95d6a98eee0538\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d41a26b71788dd72ec8ddd44cc95d6a98eee0538/0_0_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"German Chancellor Angela Merkel meeting with President Frank-Walter Steinmeier today.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a12e52360526906e8cba066\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-11-20T14:26:47.810Z\">2.26pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"64c2e7249fd2c757e5e72c7aab90a1d7c56881f8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/64c2e7249fd2c757e5e72c7aab90a1d7c56881f8/0_0_3500_2294/1000.jpg\" alt=\"ECB President Draghi in Brussels today.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"655\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">ECB President Draghi in Brussels today.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yves Herman/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Over in Brussels, European Central Bank president Mario Draghi is testifying to MEPs.</strong></p> <p>Draghi hasn\u2019t mentioned the situation in Germany in his opening statement.

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s unusually weak pay growth could be caused by workers reining in their demands due to Brexit uncertainty, a senior Bank of England official has said. In his first speech since joining the Bank from the Treasury, Dave Ramsden said the impact of the EU referendum on inflation had persuaded him to vote against an increase in interest rates earlier this month. Seven out of the nine members of Threadneedle Street\u2019s monetary policy committee backed raising the cost of borrowing for the first time in more than a decade, pushing the bank rate up from 0.25% to 0.5%. But Ramsden, one of the Bank\u2019s deputy governors, said that workers were showing pay restraint even though unemployment had continued to fall and currently stood at a 42-year low of 4.3%. The decade since the start of the financial crisis has been marked by historically weak growth in earnings, but Ramsden said it was possible that \u201csince the referendum, workers have responded to uncertainties about the outlook by showing even more flexibility in their wage demands\u201d. He told an audience at King\u2019s College, London: \u201cAt the margin, the idea that workers are responding to Brexit by showing increased flexibility could mean that is more room than headline measures of slack suggest for the economy to grow without generating above-target inflation in the medium term. \u201cFor that reason, in our November meeting I was willing to wait for more evidence on the evolution of wage and domestic cost growth before beginning to withdraw some monetary stimulus. So I voted for no change in bank rate.\u201d Ramsden said the profile of the economy since the referendum had been saucer-shaped and it was likely that the UK would remain in the flat part of the saucer for some time. The Bank\u2019s forecast of 0.4% growth each quarter over the next three years would leave it 2% smaller by 2020 than envisaged in its last pre-referendum forecast. \u201cThe biggest risk I see to that outlook for demand is around the resolution of the current uncertainty about our eventual trading arrangements and the path that will be followed to reach them. \u201cWere that uncertainty to be lifted, I can see a case why UK whole economy demand could grow more strongly, more in line with, for example, recent manufacturing indicators. Equally, were uncertainty to persist at current levels or even increase further, I could see a case for demand growth, and in particular investment growth, being weaker.\u201d \u2022Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

    "webTitle": "Bristol's housing crisis: 'The idea you would own a home is ridiculous'", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Bristol\u2019s economy has flourished in recent years, fuelled in part by its proximity to the capital\u2019s booming economy and overheating housing market. The west of England, and the city of Brunel and Banksy, is an increasingly expensive place to live with the highest private sector rental costs outside London, according to the Resolution Foundation thinktank. Bristol\u2019s burgeoning youth population is bearing the brunt, in a part of the world known not just for its heritage as a cornerstone of the industrial revolution but for its cultural scene. With typical house prices more than 10 times the average salary, that might make it tougher for the next Massive Attack or Portishead to emerge. \u201cThe idea that you would own a home in a few years is ridiculous,\u201d says Aidan Cassidy, a 23-year-old Bristol University graduate who is a member of a campaign group calling for cheaper rents in the area. \u201cFor our parents it was possible. Now people buying houses are only able to do so with the help of their parents, which is a select few relying on the bank of mum and dad.\u201d In many ways, Bristol can be used by Philip Hammond as a positive example of Britain under the Conservatives when he stands up to deliver the budget on Wednesday. He can point to more people in work than the national average, rising wages and output per worker having shot up above the UK\u2019s pre-financial crisis levels. But Bristol\u2019s economic success has attracted London \u00e9migr\u00e9s making a break from the expensive cost of living in the Big Smoke, while the city\u2019s two universities have also fed an additional 10,000 students into the local population of almost 450,000 people over the past decade. Not enough homes have been built for all of these newcomers, in a city where affordability was already stretched a decade ago. The cost of a typical home has shot up at an annual rate of more than 10% in recent years, much faster than the national average. Sheena Wynne works for a charity in the city, rents a house with her partner and finds it difficult to imagine buying a home. She partly blames \u201cbuy to leave\u201d speculation by foreign investors in London for having a knock-on effect. Houses in the capital are bought as investment assets and left empty, house hunters are then forced out of London and that, in turn, drives up costs in Bristol. \u201cIt\u2019s pushing communities out of London and they\u2019re looking for the next place to live,\u201d she says. The 30-year-old from Brighton, who studied history at Bristol University and stayed in the city after graduating, sums up the view held by many young professionals her age across the UK: \u201cI\u2019m in a relatively well-paid job and even I am struggling to save money.\u201d An additional \u00a310bn for the Tories\u2019 help-to-buy scheme \u2013 a subsidy programme for house buyers \u2013 has already been announced. But for many young people in Bristol that will not be enough. \u201cHelp to buy is a bit of a joke. For the amount you get for what you need, it\u2019s a snowflake in the ocean,\u201d says Ben Diamond, 23, who works for GKN Aerospace at the Airbus plant in Filton on the outskirts of Bristol. Diamond, and 22-year-old Jamie Furnell, both young members of the Unite trade union, believe they are bearing the brunt of a housing shortage, the rising cost of living, and government austerity that has forced their older colleagues to work for longer. Furnell reckons this is creating a \u201cbottleneck of younger people who are having to work in Tescos\u201d around the UK. The scale of the problem is such that employers are becoming concerned about their staff. Bevis Watts is managing director of ethical lender Triodos Bank, which funds green projects and social housing and employs about 150 workers in the city. \u201cWe have concerns about transport infrastructure, rising prices and affordability for the people we\u2019re employing,\u201d said Watts. \u201cThere is an enormous challenge to build all the houses that are needed.\u201d Sajid Javid, the communities secretary, gave a speech in Bristol last week, talking in the city where he grew up about the government awarding an additional \u00a32bn for affordable housing. Yet he has also suggested Britain needs \u00a350bn in government borrowing to fund a major housebuilding programme, an idea from which Hammond has distanced himself. Bristol\u2019s mayor, Marvin Rees, who became the first directly elected black mayor in the UK last year, wants Hammond to break from austerity to fund the building of more houses in the city. Rent caps could be an answer, he says, adding that the government must also devolve more power to regional authorities. \u201cAusterity has worn people down and has the resonance of hopelessness about it,\u201d he says of the spending choices facing the chancellor ahead of the budget. \u201cWe need to start investing in cities.\u201d With tuition fees running at more than \u00a39,000 a year, people from poorer backgrounds are put off higher education. Hammond will use the budget to raise the earnings threshold at which fees are repaid to \u00a325,000 from \u00a321,000. However, that won\u2019t do much for Michael Keating, 20, who is studying politics at Bristol University. He pays more than \u00a3100 per week to live in halls, and says the university should lower its costs in order to encourage diversity at an institution with more privately educated students than Cambridge. \u201cThe debt I\u2019m taking on almost doesn\u2019t feel real. You\u2019re talking about such big numbers and you\u2019re so young,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s tough to take.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Bristol\u2019s economy has flourished in recent years, fuelled in part by its proximity to the capital\u2019s booming economy and overheating housing market. The west of England, and the city of Brunel and Banksy, is an increasingly expensive place to live with the <a href=\"http://www.resolutionfoundation.org/publications/a-western-union-living-standards-and-devolution-in-the-west-of-england/\">highest private sector rental costs outside London, according to the Resolution Foundation</a> thinktank.</p> <p>Bristol\u2019s burgeoning youth population is bearing the brunt, in a part of the world known not just for its heritage as a cornerstone of the industrial revolution but for its cultural scene. With typical house prices more than 10 times the average salary, that might make it tougher for the next Massive Attack or Portishead to emerge. </p> <p>\u201cThe idea that you would own a home in a few years is ridiculous,\u201d says Aidan Cassidy, a 23-year-old Bristol University graduate who is a member of a campaign group calling for cheaper rents in the area. \u201cFor our parents it was possible. Now people buying houses are only able to do so with the help of their parents, which is a select few relying on the bank of mum and dad.\u201d</p> <p>In many ways, Bristol can be used by Philip Hammond as a positive example of Britain under the Conservatives when he stands up to deliver the budget on Wednesday. He can point to more people in work than the national average, rising wages and output per worker having shot up above the UK\u2019s pre-financial crisis levels. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ba15b234e290cd46e46e731f0048018d41b9e9f0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ba15b234e290cd46e46e731f0048018d41b9e9f0/0_55_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"New houses on a development in Bristol\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">New houses on a development in Bristol.

Bevis Watts is managing director of ethical lender Triodos Bank, which funds green projects and social housing and employs about 150 workers in the city. \u201cWe have concerns about transport infrastructure, rising prices and affordability for the people we\u2019re employing,\u201d said Watts. \u201cThere is an enormous challenge to build all the houses that are needed.\u201d</p> <p>Sajid Javid, the communities secretary, gave a speech in Bristol last week, talking in the city where he grew up about the government awarding an additional \u00a32bn for affordable housing. Yet he has also suggested Britain needs \u00a350bn in government borrowing to fund a major housebuilding programme, an idea from which Hammond has distanced himself.</p> <p>Bristol\u2019s mayor, Marvin Rees, who became the first directly elected black mayor in the UK last year, wants Hammond to break from austerity to fund the building of more houses in the city. Rent caps could be an answer, he says, adding that the government must also devolve more power to regional authorities. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d1d78befcadf28658584eafdd4190b643ce6d027\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d1d78befcadf28658584eafdd4190b643ce6d027/0_139_7360_4417/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bristol mayor Marvin Rees outside his office in City Hall.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bristol mayor Marvin Rees outside his office in City Hall.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adrian Sherratt for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cAusterity has worn people down and has the resonance of hopelessness about it,\u201d he says of the spending choices facing the chancellor ahead of the budget. \u201cWe need to start investing in cities.\u201d</p> <p>With tuition fees running at more than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jan/27/how-will-tuition-fees-affect-students\">\u00a39,000 a year,</a> people from poorer backgrounds are put off higher education.

      "bodyText": "The latest annual gross state product figures shows that overall Victoria and New South Wales were the two strongest performing economies in 2016-17, while conversely Western Australia\u2019s economy went backward by more than any state since the 1990s recession. But while the figures show the non-mining states are again leading the way, they also confirm that household incomes across the nation fell in real terms. While we get the national GDP figures every three months (the next are due in two weeks) we only get the state version once a year \u2013 known as the gross state product figures. The biggest difference between GSP and the state final demand figures that are in the quarterly GDP figures is that they include trade. This is important especially in a state like Western Australia where state final demand has been going backwards since 203-14, but because of exports the state\u2019s economy has been growing. Well, no more. In 2016-17 the WA economy shrank 2.7% \u2013 the biggest fall of a state\u2019s economy since NSW\u2019s economy fell 2.8% in the midst of the 1990s recession in 1990-91. Even worse, its GSP per capita fell 3.3%. By contrast over on the eastern seaboard Victoria\u2019s economy grew by 3.3% and NSW rose 2.9% (both behind the much smaller and thus more erratic Northern Territory and ACT). In per capita terms South Australia was the standout state. It\u2019s economy grew 1.6% in per capita terms, just ahead of NSW\u2019s 1.3%. That Victoria\u2019s GSP per capita grew by so much less than its total figure highlights the massive increase in its population that has driven a lot of its economic performance \u2013 including having the strongest growth of employment of any state on the mainland. That Western Australia saw the strongest growth of full-time employment does seem a bit odd given it is in a recession, but it is more a factor of timing than good economic news. Since the end of 2014, the number of people employed full-time in WA has plunged, but there was a bit of a natural recovery in 2016-17. However, there are still 26,000 fewer people now employed full-time in WA than there were in December 2014: The figures show just how massive has been the change after the mining boom. In 2012-13, combined business investment in WA and Queensland was 61% higher than in NSW and Victoria; in the past year it was 21% lower: And while Western Australia\u2019s economy had been able to keep above water due to exports, in 2016-17 the contribution of $9.2bn worth of net exports in real terms was not able to counter the $15.2bn fall in private capital expenditure: It all added up to WA having the worst performing economy in the year. And it meant that for the first time the combined economies of the two mining states of WA and Queensland did not contribute to Australia\u2019s GDP growth, while NSW and Victoria took the reins: The growth in NSW and Victoria was mostly driven by household expenditure as well as public spending. South Australia similarly saw a big boost in public spending, but this was mostly due to the purchase of the new Royal Adelaide hospital. The ACT was actually the strongest housing market, with new dwelling construction contributing 1% points worth of growth \u2013 double the next biggest in NSW: It means the NSW\u2019s economy now takes up a bigger share of the national economy than it has for over a decade, and WA\u2019s economy takes up a smaller share than it has since 2008-09: But one thing all the states have in common is falling real household disposable incomes. Reflecting the national picture observed in the latest GDP figures, real household disposable income fell in every state and territory in 2016-17 except for the ACT \u2013 which saw a big boost coming from property income. Western Australia still remains the richest state per capita, but its household disposable income per capita fell 2.8% in current dollars and whopping 3.5% in real terms. So big was the fall that it was the only state to actually see a fall by more than the national average: The state economy figures are good for giving the full picture of what is going on across the country. It shows that while NSW and Victoria are leading the way and driving national growth, Western Australia has fallen into a very deep recession, with the fall in business investment so large that not even its massive surge in exports is enough to overcome it. But while economic growth varies across the country, one thing households in all states are experiencing is declining incomes. As we move into the new year, with employment growing well but wages growth largely dormant, it will remain be the biggest economic puzzle \u2013 how to get income growth re-started. And as we get closer to the next election, it is a puzzle that the government hopes \u2013 and possibly needs \u2013 to solve.",

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s amazing what can happen when the government threatens to impose a price cap on energy bills. Suddenly the big six suppliers, who have spent the three decades since privatisation wedded to their poor-value standard variable tariffs, or SVTs, become a whirr of activity. Centrica, parent of British Gas, is the third to declare it will abolish SVTs. Iain Conn, the Centrica chief executive, says the timing is unrelated to the government\u2019s threat to cap SVTs, a claim that will convince almost nobody. This looks like an 11th-hour bid to persuade ministers to change their mind. OK, it\u2019s true, as Conn says, that Centrica has been muttering about the wisdom of getting rid of SVTs for 18 months. But, come on, this new thinking still postdates Ed Miliband\u2019s price-cap proposals, first aired in 2013. All the while, Centrica has argued that its SVT represents good value and is preferred by some customers. Still, if the new approach is a serious attempt to ween customers off SVTs, and persuade them to choose a tariff actively, that\u2019s clearly to be welcomed. But there\u2019s an obvious problem. Energy supply is not like home insurance. Companies have an obligation to supply and can\u2019t simply switch off customers who are too lazy, or too baffled, to shop around. Those determinedly inactive punters still have to be charged something, and Centrica\u2019s new emergency default tariff looks suspiciously like another SVT, just dressed in different clothes. Conn rejects the charge of making cosmetic tweaks, but it\u2019s hard to understand why the government should take him on trust. Ministers would look ridiculous if they are lobbied into dropping price caps but the new default tariffs turn out to be just as poor value as the current SVTs. You can\u2019t blame Conn for trying new tactics, of course. Centrica\u2019s share price has more than halved since Miliband changed the debate over energy bills. There is no penalty for throwing the dice one last time. Conn is probably also correct that price caps risk making a bad position worse. But the timing of the new proposals, from a political perspective, looks terrible. The storm has been gathering for years. It\u2019s a bit late in the day to declare that you had a magic solution all along. Time to dial down the drama at the London Stock Exchange Here are two predictions about the outcome of the great bust-up at the London Stock Exchange, assuming next month\u2019s extraordinary meeting of shareholders goes ahead. First, chairman Donald Brydon will survive the attempt by hedge fund The Children\u2019s Investment Fund (TCI) to oust him. Indeed, he will probably secure a landslide victory. Second, if the public showdown happens, fund managers\u2019 support will come at a cost for Brydon. Once he has found a successor to chief executive Xavier Rolet, investors will expect him to make his own exit in reasonably short order. It will be punishment, of a sort, for failing to defuse this embarrassing situation. The first prediction \u2013 the chairman\u2019s survival \u2013 seems almost certain, because most fund managers know how the governance game is supposed to work. It is not shareholders\u2019 job to try to overturn an important boardroom decision, such as the departure of a chief executive. In this case, everybody agrees that Rolet has done a brilliant job but, if the board has decided it\u2019s time for a change of boss after nine years, that judgment has to be respected. If not, the entire crew of non-executive directors would probably be obliged to resign in sympathy with Brydon, plunging the LSE into a deeper crisis. The chief executive can\u2019t be seen to be bigger than the board. The second outcome almost flows from the first. This mess should have been avoided. It has been caused, in large part, by Brydon\u2019s refusal to explain why Rolet is leaving next year. TCI and its founder, Sir Chris Hohn, were entitled to ask the question and a more deft chairman would have provided the answer. A blow-by-blow account was not necessary, just evidence that the board had reasons to act. Outright refusal to explain was never going to be enough in the 21st century, and the use of confidentiality clauses was silly. Even at this late stage, it should be possible to avoid a public confrontation and a vote. The first step is for the principal players \u2013 Brydon, Hohn and Rolet \u2013 to recognise that the current soap opera serves nobody\u2019s interests, least of all those of the LSE and its employees. Flying into the post-Brexit future Good news for London City Airport: the European Medicines Agency will be relocating from Canary Wharf to Amsterdam, and Paris has got the gig to host the European Banking Authority. For the well-paid UK staff of both bodies, a daily or weekly commute to the Dutch and French capitals is doable. The UK, one assumes, wanted to recruit a few senior folk for equivalent agencies.

The French company, which operates the Channel Tunnel, has chosen the admirably Anglo-Saxon name to \u201cmark the group\u2019s passage into an exciting new era for mobility infrastructures\u201d. The change of branding will be only at group level, with customers looking to take its shuttle service between Folkestone and Calais continuing to book with Eurotunnel\u2019s Le Shuttle service. However, the rebranding recalls other identity crises that met with varying degrees of acceptance \u2013 particularly the Post Office\u2019s dalliance with the name Consignia. Adopted in 2001 to public bemusement, it was dropped a year later. A Eurotunnel \u2013 or Getlink \u2013 spokesman said the rebranding was necessary because the group now owned companies beyond the tunnel. They include Europorte, which runs freight through the tunnel, and ElecLink, a projected power line to connect the French and UK national grids. For cross-Channel passengers of a certain vintage, the name may also recall the doomed Sealink ferry service which went out of operation in the 1990s around the time the tunnel started operating. A spokesman confirmed that directors themselves had come up with the new name, which was unanimously approved by Getlink\u2019s Anglo-French board, including the former British government ministers Patricia Hewitt and Tim Yeo. He said: \u201cNo massive expensive brand identity organisation came in. It\u2019s Get \u2013 go and acquire \u2013 and Link. It\u2019s not fancy, it\u2019s not invented. It\u2019s very Anglo-Saxon \u2013 and a large part of our customer base and investor base is Anglo-Saxon.\u201d The initials GET are already used on stock exchanges for Groupe Eurotunnel, and the new name is also believed to be easily pronounceable by its French chief executive, Jacques Gounon. In a statement, Gounon said: \u201cGetlink is all that is Eurotunnel and more than just Eurotunnel!\u201d The spokesman said the new name would allow the company and investors to \u201cstop thinking about the past and start thinking about the future in a positive way\u201d. While Eurotunnel\u2019s refinancing and debts made it a byword for disastrous investment from 1994 to 2000 \u2013 and has been affected by Brexit and Europe\u2019s migrant crisis in recent years \u2013 the group has annual revenues of more than \u20ac1bn (\u00a3886m) and provides good returns to shareholders. The group, which was forced to give up its own ferry service by competition authorities, also owns Ciffco, a European railway training centre, along with its rail freight and power businesses. It has the concession to operate the Channel Tunnel until 2086. Confusingly for many, it does not operate Eurostar trains, only the train shuttles that carry vehicle traffic. That confusion may yet continue for passengers looking to book, as the spokesman confirmed: \u201cThe Eurotunnel brand is one of our jewels so that won\u2019t change.\u201d \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

      "bodyText": "British Gas owner Centrica is to scrap its widely criticised standard variable tariff (SVT) for new customers from April, and other energy companies are expected to follow suit. The company is the third of the big six suppliers to announce the end of its SVT following announcements from E.on and Scottish Power. Theresa May promised action last month to end \u201crip-off energy prices\u201d, proposing a price cap on SVTs and other default tariffs \u2013 the expensive plans that customers are moved to when cheaper fixed deals end. Britain\u2019s competition watchdog found that consumers were being overcharged by \u00a31.4bn a year, a figure that Centrica contests. The company said it would stop offering the SVT on 31 March, offering new customers a choice of at least two three-year fixed tariffs instead. \u201cThis will result in a broader range of better deals with fewer people on default tariffs,\u201d it said. \u201cAnd if standard variable tariffs could be ended completely then the effects would be market-wide.\u201d About 5 million British Gas customers are currently on SVTs. Household energy bills have doubled in Britain over the past decade and now average \u00a31,200 a year. The company will set up a new 12-month default tariff with no exit fees for customers who do not pick a new contract when their existing one expires. Centrica said it was working with the regulator on whether the default tariff should be a fixed or variable price. Centrica\u2019s chief executive, Iain Conn, said: \u201cThe default needs to be an unattractive tariff but not a punitive tariff.\u201d A spokesperson for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: \u201cCentrica\u2019s decision to put an end to poor value tariffs is an encouraging first step in helping to create a fairer energy market. We will not rest until we see the \u00a31.4bn consumer detriment identified by the Competition and Markets Authority addressed \u2013 which is exactly why we published draft legislation to cap tariffs last month.\u201d The government has put forward legislation to cap the energy bills of 11m households for as long as five years, which it claims could save people up to \u00a3100 a year. The measure, which will not take effect until 2019 at the earliest, will apply to anyone on a standard variable tariff. Gillian Guy, the Citizens Advice chief executive, welcomed Centrica\u2019s move but said consumers still needed additional protections, including a price cap. Centrica reiterated its opposition to price caps, arguing that they lead to reduced competition and choice, and to prices that tend to cluster around the cap. Peter Earl, the head of energy at comparethemarket.com, said: \u201cThe writing is on the wall for SVTs. With three of the big six scrapping them, we expect the others to follow suit. The fact that British Gas is only scrapping SVTs for new customers from April suggests that millions of customers from various suppliers may remain on these tariffs for the foreseeable future. SVTs represent woefully poor value for money and few tears will be shed at their demise.\u201d He said consumers would save an average of \u00a3300 a year if they switched from an SVT to a fixed tariff. Stephen Murray, the energy expert at Moneysupermarket.com, said Centrica\u2019s move highlighted that change within the industry was \u201cmuch more effective than a one-size-fits-all price cap, which could have unintended consequences such as many of the best deals disappearing, prices finding a higher level, and a growing market of disengaged customers\u201d. Greg Jackson, the chief executive of rival supplier Octopus Energy, which invests in solar generation, described the move as a \u201cruse\u201d. \u201cIf they wanted to bring lower bills to customers, they could just cut their prices. Instead, they\u2019re bringing in an ever more complex array of high fixed tariffs making it even harder for customers to know whether they\u2019re getting good value.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The International Monetary Fund has said the conditions seem right for a pickup in growth in Australia but warned it would only be modest, with record-low wage growth weighing on household incomes. It has also predicted Australia\u2019s ultra-low interest rate environment will persist for years, saying a sustained rise in inflation will come about only when the economy has been at full employment \u201cfor some time\u201d. That is the preliminary verdict from International Monetary Fund staff who have just completed an official visit to Australia. They considered the health of the housing market and found the market was expected to cool in coming months but imbalances \u2013 such as poor housing affordability and household debt vulnerabilities \u2013 were \u201cunlikely to be corrected soon\u201d. The IMF verdict came the same day as Jonathan Kearns, the Reserve Bank\u2019s head of financial stability, noted in a speech on Australia\u2019s housing market that house prices in Australia had risen by two-thirds since 2009, with growth of housing credit outpacing incomes. He said Australians need not worry about negative impacts from foreigners buying residential property, because purchases by foreign buyers \u201cdo not, on the whole, reduce the supply of dwellings available to local residents\u201d. \u201cIn fact, [they] may actually contribute to expansion of the housing stock,\u201d he said. The IMF has noted that the Turnbull government\u2019s plan to return the budget to surplus by 2020-21 was predicated on a \u201crapid rebound\u201d of nominal GDP in the next few years. Deloitte Access Economics warned earlier this month that budget plan was unrealistic, because it was built on the assumption that 44% of the estimated increase in national income over the next four years would be collected in federal taxes \u2013 a record-high share. The Deloitte report followed a separate report from the Parliamentary Budget Office last month that found the government\u2019s plan to return the budget to surplus was heavily reliant on personal tax increases across every income bracket, with the largest tax increase to hit middle-income earners. It said the tax hikes reflected a seismic shift in the taxation burden from businesses to individuals. The personal tax increases are necessary to compensate for the government\u2019s controversial $65.4bn company tax cuts. The IMF has supported the Turnbull government\u2019s call for greater corporate and personal income tax cuts, as part of a larger plan for tax reform. It said Australia\u2019s state governments should abolish their stamp duty tax regimes and replace them with broad-based land taxes, such as the new land tax regime in the Australian Capital Territory. It said \u201csignificant\u201d corporate tax cuts in other large advanced economies could encourage similar tax cuts here, because they would have \u201ccapital flow implications of potential concern for Australia\u201d. The IMF staff said conditions were in place for a pickup in economic growth to above-trend rates in Australia, reflecting a stronger global outlook, recent stronger employment growth and a stronger contribution from infrastructure investment. \u201c[But] the pickup in growth is likely to be modest, while inflation and wages will be slow to rise,\u201d they said. \u201cWith stronger momentum in domestic demand and inflation close to the midpoint of the [RBA\u2019s] target range not yet secured, continued macroeconomic policy support will remain essential. \u201cWith the cash rate at 1.5%, monetary policy remains appropriately accommodative. \u201cWith Australia\u2019s recovery lagging that of other major advanced economies, monetary policy should remain firmly focused on ensuring stronger sustained momentum in domestic demand and inflation.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Many items discounted over the Black Friday weekend can be bought for the same price or even cheaper at other times of the year, an investigation by consumer group Which? has found. With shoppers expected to spend at least \u00a310bn this week, a Which? survey of deals on offer for last year\u2019s Black Friday found more than half (60%) cost the same or less either before or after the event. For almost half the deals, the price was the same or even lower in December, immediately after the US-inspired discount day. The group tracked prices of the 35 most popular tech, home and personal care products on sale for the 2016 Black Friday weekend over the course of a year. Of those, 22 were from Currys/PC World, 12 from Argos and one from Amazon. A Neff Slide and Hide Oven on offer for \u00a3494.99 at Currys/PC World last Black Friday was sold for \u00a345 less just three weeks later, and was cheaper than the Black Friday price for at least 113 other days of the year. A Samsung 55-inch Smart 4K Ultra HD curved TV advertised by Currys as \u201cSave \u00a3400, now \u00a3849\u201d was \u00a350 cheaper at least 29 times in December, January and April and \u00a379 cheaper at least 18 times in May. Currys also offered a DeLonghi bean-to-cup coffee machine for \u00a3349 for Black Friday in 2016, which it said was down from the \u00a3729.99 price for most of September and October. However, Which? found the coffee machine was sold for \u00a3579.99 for nearly three weeks during this time (Currys told the group this was an isolated mistake) and remained at the Black Friday price for almost all of December. The Oral-B Pro 3000 crossaction electric toothbrush from Amazon was advertised as \u201csave 26%: was \u00a340.49, now \u00a329.99\u201d but was \u00a35 cheaper on at least two days in July. A 49-inch LG TV advertised by Argos at \u00a3499 as \u201cOur lowest price\u201d was \u00a34 cheaper a week later and \u00a316 cheaper at the end of December. Experts have warned that increased costs from the weaker pound and higher business rates mean that retailers will not offer the same discounts as last year. Eleanor Parr at retail analysis firm GlobalData also said that electrical products were likely to be most affected by inflation, with fashion and homewares also hit. While there are some bargains to be had, Which? advised shoppers to do some research before rushing to buy for Black Friday. Alex Neill, Which? managing director of home products and services, said: \u201cOur research shows that although Black Friday can offer some great discounts, not all offers are as good as they seem. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to get swept along by hype and excitement on the day, so we recommend doing some preparation and research to help make sure you really are getting a good deal when shopping in the sales.\u201d Currys/PC World told Which? it had reduced about 4,000 products for Black Friday 2016, adding: \u201cWe make no apology for reducing some of them even more after that period.\u201d Argos said: \u201cBlack Friday is a fantastic event which allows customers to choose from thousands of products which offer great value. This does not exclude these products from other sales or promotional activity at other times of the year.\u201d Amazon said: \u201cWe offer many thousands of incredible deals around Black Friday representing millions of pounds of savings for our customers across a vast selection of products.\u201d \u2022Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

      "bodyText": "British shoppers could spend less on Christmas for the first time since 2012, as a fall in real wages and continuing economic uncertainty put a brake on celebrations. A slump in spending on Christmas getaways, as well as cutbacks on clothing and household goods, are expected to result in a 0.1% dip in UK spending during the key shopping period of November and December, according to research compiled by IHS Markit for Visa, the card provider. High streets will take the pain, with spending at physical stores expected to drop 2.1%, the third successive year of contraction and the biggest since 2012. In contrast, online sales are forecast to rise by 3.6% over the period, accounting for a record share of this year\u2019s Christmas spending. Of every \u00a35 spent during November and December, almost \u00a32 will be spent online. Mark Antipof, the chief commercial officer at Visa, said: \u201cLooking back, consumers were in a sweet spot in 2016 \u2013 low inflation and rising wages meant there was a little extra in household budgets to spend on the festive period. This year has seen a reversal of fortunes \u2013 with inflation outpacing wage growth and the recent interest rate rise leaving shoppers with less money in their pockets. \u201cAlthough overall sales are likely to disappoint, we expect some clear winners to emerge. Online and mobile are set to take a record share of Christmas spending. Hotels, restaurants and bars are also forecast to report strong growth as Britons choose to celebrate Christmas and New Year closer to home.\u201d The prediction of a gloomy Christmas comes after retail sales tumbled to their first year-on-year fall since 2013 last month, according to the Office for National Statistics. Food prices, which were 3.5% higher than a year earlier, helped push the volume of goods bought in shops and online down by 0.3% from October 2016. A recent survey by the CBI business lobby group showed high street sales falling at their fastest rate since the height of the recession in 2009. Meanwhile, a report by the KPMG/Ipsos Retail Think Tank late last month also warned of tougher times for retailers in the final three months of the year. It said some non-food sales had been pulled forward into September, when a cold snap kicked off the autumn season early, while rising personal debt levels, the edge up in interest rates, shrinking wages and increasing inflation all added to pressure on household budgets. John Lewis, Marks &amp; Spencer, Next and New Look have all reported gloomy figures in recent weeks, not helped by an unseasonably warm October. It\u2019s a nailbiting end to the season in which many chains bank the lion\u2019s share of their annual profits, and retail bosses are battling to protect profit margins against the rise in imported goods resulting from the weakness of sterling. But not every analyst is predicting a slowdown. A consumer survey by Deloitte suggested that shoppers plan to spend an average of \u00a3544 each this Christmas, 1.8% more than last year, and are expected to spend \u00a310.1bn in the week of Black Friday, nearly 4% more than last year as more retailers take part in the US-inspired promotional day. \u2022Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The government is under pressure to change the law to tackle bogus self-employment and protect workers in the gig economy after a report published on Monday by two influential parliamentary committees. The work and pensions select committee and the business, energy and industrial strategy (BEIS) committee have prepared draft legislation intended to close the loopholes that allow \u201cirresponsible companies to underpay workers\u201d. Frank Field, the Labour MP who chairs the work and pensions committee, called on the prime minister to \u201cfulfil the promise she made on the steps of Downing Street on her first day in office\u201d by backing a draft bill \u201cthat would end the mass exploitation of ordinary, hard-working people in the gig economy\u201d. About 5 million people \u2013 15% of the workforce \u2013 are self-employed, with about 1.6 million of those thought to work for the likes of Uber, Deliveroo and other gig economy employers who rely on people who sign up for work on a daily basis. The rise of other insecure forms of work, with about 900,000 on zero-hours contracts and 1.6 million on temporary or agency contracts, has raised fears that employment law is struggling to protect those working in the modern economy. \u201cThe bill would put good business on a level playing field, not being undercut by bad business. It is time to close the loopholes that allow irresponsible companies to underpay workers, avoid taxes and free ride on our welfare system,\u201d Field said. Rachel Reeves, the chair of the BEIS committee, added: \u201cUber, Deliveroo and others like to bang the drum for the benefits of flexibility for their workforce but currently all the burden of this flexibility is picked up by taxpayers and workers. This must change.\u201d The Labour-led committees have supported a large number of the recommendations of the government-backed Matthew Taylor review into modern employment and gig economy working. The government said it would respond to Taylor\u2019s report by the end of this year, but some employment rights activists had feared it would fall off the agenda as parliament became overcome with Brexit matters. Taylor said: \u201cThis excellent report shows that whatever concerns the government has about my recommendations, parliamentary support is no longer a reason not to pursue them.\u201d The MPs\u2019 draft bill aims to clarify the definitions of employment status and enshrine the presumption that those working for companies over a certain size are all classed as workers, with rights to the minimum wage and holiday pay. The new legislation would put the onus on the company to prove self-employed status, in a dispute, rather than on the worker to do so through the courts. MPs also proposed that companies be legally obliged to provide all workers and employees with a clear written statement of their employment status, laying out their rights and entitlements, on their first day at work. Unions said the reforms should go further. Jason Moyer-Lee, the general secretary of the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain (IWGB), said the report did not \u201ccall for extending more basic employment rights \u2013 such as statutory sick pay or right to claim unfair dismissal \u2013 to workers.\u201d The GMB\u2019s general secretary, Tim Roache, said the plans \u201cmay make a small difference\u201d. \u201cHowever, the fact remains that without real investment in HMRC and a political will to get tough on rogue employers who are cheating the British taxpayer out of millions and reaping profits out of worker exploitation, then there will be no significant change,\u201d he said. Employers\u2019 body, the CBI, though, said companies would be concerned. \u201cBased on a very limited review of the evidence, the committees have brought forward proposals that close off flexibility for firms to grow and create jobs, when the issues that have been raised can be addressed by more effective enforcement action and more targeted changes to the law,\u201d said Neil Carberry, the CBI managing director for people and infrastructure. The bill also includes changes to the law to make it easier for workers to be consulted and informed about business changes that affect their employment and also help casual workers get support in raising legitimate concerns with their employer. The report recommends enabling class actions by groups of workers to establish employment status, making it more difficult for companies to suggest rulings only apply to individuals. It also suggests\u201cpunitive fines\u201d for those who have previously been found to have broken employment law and \u201cnaming and shaming\u201d for non-accidental breaches by businesses and supply chains. MPs also called for higher fines for firms found to have paid below the national minimum wage, for example, to help increase resources for labour market watchdogs. The bill proposes asking the Low Pay Commission to test the idea of offering premium pay, above the legal minimum wage, to workers who do not have guaranteed hours. It also proposes ditching the Swedish derogation, a loophole which allows agency workers placed with companies to be paid less than direct employees, provided the agency agrees to continue paying them for at least four weeks at times when it is unable to find them work. A BEIS spokesperson said the government would respond fully at a later date, but added: \u201cWe have record numbers of people in work thanks to our flexible labour market, benefitting both workers and business. But we recognise that the labour market is not working for everyone which is why we commissioned Matthew Taylor to review modern working practices to ensure our employment rules and rights keep up to date. \u2022Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here. \u2022 This article was amended on 20 November 2017 to further clarify the changes to the ICE regulations.",

The new legislation would put the onus on the company to prove self-employed status, in a dispute, rather than on the worker to do so through the courts.</p> <p>MPs also proposed that companies be legally obliged to provide all workers and employees with a clear written statement of their employment status, laying out their rights and entitlements, on their first day at work.</p> <p>Unions said the reforms should go further. <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/jason-moyer-lee\">Jason Moyer-Lee</a>, the general secretary of the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain (IWGB), said the report did not \u201ccall for extending more basic employment rights \u2013 such as statutory sick pay or right to claim unfair dismissal \u2013 to workers.\u201d</p> <p>The GMB\u2019s general secretary, Tim Roache, said the plans \u201cmay make a small difference\u201d. \u201cHowever, the fact remains that without real investment in HMRC and a political will to get tough on rogue employers who are cheating the British taxpayer out of millions and reaping profits out of worker exploitation, then there will be no significant change,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Employers\u2019 body, the CBI, though, said companies would be concerned. \u201cBased on a very limited review of the evidence, the committees have brought forward proposals that close off flexibility for firms to grow and create jobs, when the issues that have been raised can be addressed by more effective enforcement action and more targeted changes to the law,\u201d said Neil Carberry, the CBI managing director for people and infrastructure.</p> <p>The bill also includes changes to the law to make it easier for workers to be consulted and informed about business changes that affect their employment and also help casual workers get support in raising legitimate concerns with their employer.</p> <p>The report recommends enabling class actions by groups of workers to establish employment status, making it more difficult for companies to suggest rulings only apply to individuals. It also suggests\u201cpunitive fines\u201d for those who have previously been found to have broken employment law and \u201cnaming and shaming\u201d for non-accidental breaches by businesses and supply chains. </p> <p>MPs also called for higher fines for firms found to have paid below the national minimum wage, for example, to help increase resources for labour market watchdogs. </p> <p>The bill proposes asking the Low Pay Commission to test the idea of offering premium pay, above the legal minimum wage, to workers who do not have guaranteed hours. </p> <p>It also proposes ditching <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.acas.org.uk/?articleid=4162\">the Swedish derogation</a>, a loophole which allows agency workers placed with companies to be paid less than direct employees, provided the agency agrees to continue paying them for at least four weeks at times when it is unable to find them work.</p> <p>A BEIS spokesperson said the government would respond fully at a later date, but added: \u201cWe have record numbers of people in work thanks to our flexible labour market, benefitting both workers and business. But we recognise that the labour market is not working for everyone which is why we commissioned Matthew Taylor to review modern working practices to ensure our employment rules and rights keep up to date.</p> <p>\u2022Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BusinessDesk\">@BusinessDesk</a>, or sign up to the daily Business Today email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2017/may/16/guardian-business-today-sign-up-financial-news-email?CMP=business_footnote\">here</a>.<br><br><em>\u2022 This article was amended on 20 November 2017 to further clarify the changes to the ICE regulations.</em><br></p> <p> </p>",
