      "bodyText": "House prices are rising at their fastest pace for almost seven years, according to the latest survey to point to a property market on the rise. Rising prices and growing demand have also driven a jump in the number of people putting their homes on the market, according to the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics). Its survey echoed a report from Britain's largest mortgage lender, Halifax, last week that house prices were 5.4% higher than in the summer of 2012. Estate agents polled by Rics indicated the fastest rise in prices since their peak in late 2006 as government schemes such as Funding for Lending continued to improve access to mortgages. Rics warned, however, of the risk of prices soaring to unaffordable levels, echoing commentators who have warned that George Osborne's property market schemes could spark another house price bubble. The group said that although the market conditions were prompting more people to put their home on the market, demand still outstripped supply. \"During August, the number of would-be buyers increased yet again as increasingly accessible finance allowed more people to enter the market,\" the Rics report said. Peter Bolton King, the Rics global residential director, added: \"It's not surprising that more and more people are looking to sell their homes. Buyers are out there and prices are on the up so if you're looking to move it's a good time to do so. What we don't wish to see, however, is prices rise to such an extent that they become unaffordable. \"For the market to work properly, it's vital that property is both accessible and affordable, and we'll be monitoring the situation very carefully as the housing sector continues to recover.\" Following government moves to improve access to mortgages, there have been reports of first-time buyers flocking into the housing market. LSL Property Services, which owns estate agencies including Your Move, suggested last week that there were more than 26,000 first-time buyer transactions in July \u2013 an increase of 45% on the same month in 2012. The Rics report said the Funding for Lending scheme and Help to Buy \"appear to be part of the reason for the pick-up in activity\". The report's headline prices balance stood at 40, based on the proportion of respondents reporting a rise in prices minus those reporting a fall. That was the highest since November 2006 and compared with 36 a month earlier. Rics said each region across the country saw supply increase in August as the recovery continued to spread from south-east England to other areas. The South West and the North East, in particular, saw the number of new homes coming onto the market rise significantly. Rics added: \"It seems that recent price rises are going to continue unabated.\" The estate agents surveyed expect prices across Britain, on average, to increase by 2.2% over the coming year and by 4.4% in each of the next five years. At the start of this year, those respective figures were 0.6% and 3.4%. The survey of 348 agents will intensify fears of unsustainable rises that will leave another generation saddled with huge debts. Experts' concerns about another bubble centre on the Help to Buy scheme, which was introduced in April and provides equity loans for first-time buyers of up to 20% towards the cost of new-build properties worth up to \u00a3600,000. The International Monetary Fund and others have criticised the scheme, which will be expanded in January to make the loans available to all buyers and all types of property up to the \u00a3600,000 limit. Some of the estate agents surveyed by Rics predicted a boom as a result of the government schemes; others were more cautious about their impact. \"The second stage of the government's Help to Buy scheme in January 2014 could create a bubble,\" said Michael Brooker, an agent in Crowborough, East Sussex. Others were less confident the price rises would last. Julian Dyer in the Welsh town of Abergavenny, said: \"The market has definitely perked up over the last 6 months, however the market seems very fragile, and I am not convinced that the upturn is sustainable. The government initiative to help builders does not seem to have worked in this area.\"",

However, the details of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research forecast (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/sep/06/economic-growth-gdp-figures\" title=\"\">UK economy is expanding at the same rate as when coalition came to power</a>, 7 September) show that, despite real GDP being 6% higher, real personal disposable income will be about 1% lower in 2015 than in 2010. The difference is partly explained by the UK's population growth, but the key point is that GDP is not the same as household income \u2013 which is what matters for living standards. Headlines should reflect what is happening to household real incomes, rather than the usually quoted GDP figures.<br><strong>Professor Tony Atkinson</strong><br><em>Oxford</em></p> <p>\u2022 On 9 September you published a number of pieces discussing new economic data indicating the possibility of recovery, and that this would only be a true recovery once wages started to rise.</p> <p>My experience, through undertaking a great deal of market research throughout the recession, shows that most households are looking for an economic recovery to provide greater job security and certainty of income. This allows people to contemplate new expenditure, as they feel confident that there will be the money to pay for it.

      "bodyText": "\"Osborne will say that the best way of safeguarding living standards is growth\" (Miliband vows to get tough on zero-hours jobs, 9 September, 2013). However, the details of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research forecast (UK economy is expanding at the same rate as when coalition came to power, 7 September) show that, despite real GDP being 6% higher, real personal disposable income will be about 1% lower in 2015 than in 2010. The difference is partly explained by the UK's population growth, but the key point is that GDP is not the same as household income \u2013 which is what matters for living standards. Headlines should reflect what is happening to household real incomes, rather than the usually quoted GDP figures. Professor Tony Atkinson Oxford \u2022 On 9 September you published a number of pieces discussing new economic data indicating the possibility of recovery, and that this would only be a true recovery once wages started to rise. My experience, through undertaking a great deal of market research throughout the recession, shows that most households are looking for an economic recovery to provide greater job security and certainty of income. This allows people to contemplate new expenditure, as they feel confident that there will be the money to pay for it. So, while extra money would obviously be good, this isn't the first priority. Meanwhile, businesses are reluctant to engage in wage rises as high employment costs irrevocably increase a business's cost base to the detriment of corporate manoeuvrability \u2013 when times become tough then the only option becomes layoffs or closure. Instead, bonuses and other rewards are in place to share in the success of the employer, which can be varied in line with performance. Given this. I find your underlying editorial assumption that wages must rise to demonstrate economic recovery shockingly naive, if not a bit old-fashioned. Germany has demonstrated that economic strength and sustainability come, in part, from wage restraint: wages there have fallen in real terms every year since reunification. Today's reality is that if you want to earn more you must seek new skills or job progression, not expect more money for doing the same. Simon Rowland London \u2022 Karel Williams (Comment, 9 September) is right: our unbalanced economy means that London's continued good fortune does not represent a national recovery. There are persistent regional inequalities. As he says, labels are important. It's a shame therefore that he doesn't explicitly refer to other ways in which our economy could be perceived as \"unbalanced\", such as the size of financial services in relation to other sectors. Not only are these other meanings important in their own right for our understanding of the economy, we also need to be vigilant to political discourse on our \"unbalanced economy\" and proposals to \"rebalance\" it, such as HS2 (a project not referred to by Williams). If HS2 really can help \"rebalance\" our economy (Letters, 9 September), it's essential that the public understands exactly how our current economy is \"unbalanced\". Politicians should not hide behind ambiguity. Dr Alex May Manchester \u2022 Polly Toynbee, as always, hits the nail on the head, when she writes: \"If competition over living standards for low and middle earners becomes the next battleground, it's cause for celebration\" (Whose recovery is this?, Comment, 7 September).

      "bodyText": "Tokyo's Olympic triumph was followed on Monday by good news from the Japanese economy after official figures showed GDP grew faster than previously estimated in the early part of the summer. The Nikkei index jumped 2.5% in response to a rise in GDP from 0.6% in the three months to the end of June to a revised 0.9% that put the annualised rate at 3.8%. Analysts said the rocketing economy was testament to the new political regime under prime minister Shinzo Abe, who has given his name to the Abenomics shock treatment his administration has delivered to the economy following his election last year. Since October 2012 the Nikkei has soared from 8,500 to 15,000 before falling back to 13,500. In the last fortnight the index has regained some momentum and begun to head back towards 14,000 again. While the index is still well below the 38,000 it registered in the 1980s boom, and its pre-Lehmans crash peak of 18,100, the stock market rise over the last year is seen as an indication of Abe's determination to inject some life into the economy and spur growth. The upward revision in the last GDP figures appears to vindicate his policies \u2013 which have included appointing a new central bank governor with a remit to loosen monetary policy and backing from the finance ministry for large scale public infrastructure projects. Nancy Curtin, chief investment officer at Close Brothers Asset Management, said it was clear that the world's third largest economy is heading in the right direction: \"The red carpet was rolled out last week for Japan's strengthened Q2 GDP figures when the Bank of Japan announced expectations for inflation are improving. \"But it is not the only sign of recovery as a result of Shinzo Abe's initial shock and awe approach.

Private consumption was revised down from 0.8% to 0.7% quarter on quarter and consumer confidence slipped slightly. Capital Economics said consumers were cutting back on spending after becoming worried that wages will fail to keep pace with inflation.

      "bodyText": "Europe's stock markets have closed for the day. Italy's FTSE MIB posted the biggest rise of the main indices, up over 1% on relief that the coalition government had not been rocked (yet) by the Berlusconi panic. Other markets ended flat, or down, with the Syrian crisis continuing to drive caution in the City. Closing prices: \u2022 FTSE 100: down 16 points at 6530, -0.25% \u2022 German DAX: flat at 8276 \u2022 French CAC: down 8 points at 4040, -0.2% \u2022 Spanish IBEX: down 22 points at 8,632, - 0.26% \u2022 Italian FTSE MIB: up 197 points at 17,244, +1.16% And in the currency markets, the pound has gained almost one cent against the US dollar to $1.5712, partly due to George Osborne's bullish speech this morning. Chris Beauchamp, market analyst at IG, points out that the encouraging news from Asia overnight (Japanese GDP revised higher, and forecast-beating Chinese exports) had little impact on London shares; Signs of life in China failed to buoy the mining sector in any meaningful fashion, with the sector showing a distinctly mixed performance. Rio Tinto and Anglo American were in the ascendant, but BHP and Antofagasta refused to join in the general rejoicing among raw materials firms. Sentiment was hit by a sharp drop in BG Group shares, as the firm warned that troubles in Egypt would hit production while its Norway efforts would not bear fruit as early as hoped. The company\u2019s protestations of better times to come fell on deaf ears, and the shares lost 5.3%. Here's the biggest fallers on the FTSE 100 tonight: While City brokerage ICAP was the biggest riser on the FTSE 250 index - following that report that it faces a \u00a370m Libor fine (see 2.01pm). That suggests \u00a370m would be a good result for the firm.... And on that note, I'm off. Back tomorrow. Thanks all, and goodnight. GW This video, by the crisis-scape.net team, records how migrants in Greece have been subject to more attacks, and arrests, since the financial crisis began: The team are also recording examples of such attacks here: map.crisis-scape.net A new survey of world happiness, conducted by the UN, had found that the four eurozone countries at the heart of the debt crisis have become much less pleasant places to live. The survey, published today, confirmed what many blog readers have long reported \u2013 that happiness has deteriorated across the eurozone periphery. Greece suffered the most, coming second only to Egypt in terms of the drop in happiness over the last year. Spain came sixth for deteriorating happiness, followed by Italy in 8th place and Portugal in 12th. The lengthy report (156 pages, online here) said the drop in happiness was \"far greater\" than would be expected from just the drop in incomes since the crisis began. Instead, soaring unemployment and the restrictions on \"life choices\" are the key reasons. The report explains: The biggest hit, in terms of the implied drop in life evaluations, was in respondents\u2019 perceived freedom to make key life choices. In each country the crisis tended to limit opportunities for individuals, both through cutbacks in available services and loss of expected opportunities. Portugal's drop in happiness was entirely due to the jobless crisis, the report found, while other issues such as 'perceived rising corruption' and disintegrating social fabric were responsible for tumbling happiness in the other three countries, as this chart from the report shows: Greece came in 70th overall for happiness in the report, with Portugal at 85, Italy at 45 and Spain at 38. The report also suggests that the striking slump in happiness in Greece is because people have dramatically lost faith in the country's institutions - namely the police and the legal system. It explains: Although generalized social trust is maintained roughly at pre-crisis levels, trust in police and in the legal system fall much more in Greece. Trust in police stayed stable at pre-crisis levels, or even grew slightly, in Spain and Portugal, while falling by 25% in Greece. Trust in the legal system fell significantly in all three countries [Greece, Italy and Spain], but by almost three times as much in Greece as in the other countries. And Greece's eKathimerini newspaper flags up another bleak statistics -- that suicides in Greece have doubled since the crisis began. It begins: A day ahead of World Suicide Prevention Day, reports suggest that the doubling of the number of suicides in Greece in the three-year period between 2009 and 2011 represents a trend that shows no sign of abating this year. Combined data by the Hellenic Statistical Authority (ELSTAT), the Citizens' Protection Ministry and the European statistical agency Eurostat show that Greece went from being one of the countries with the smallest number of suicides in the world to seeing suicides double in the three years between 2009 and 2011. The number of deaths by suicide rose from 2.5 per 100,000 of the population before 2009 to over five per 100,000, or 1,245 in the three-year period during which the country was hit by a combination of deep recession and tough austerity measures. Over in Rome, Italian politicians are considing whether Silvio Berlusconi should be barred from the Senate following the failure of his final appeal against a tax fraud charge. As explained at 9.53am, there are fears that Berlusconi could withdraw his People of Liberty (PDL) from the coalition government unless he is reprieved (he's even filed an appeal to the European Court of Human Rights) . Senators are unlikely to take a decision today. Committee member Benedetto della Vedova (who represents Mario Monti's centrist Civic Choice party) has told La Repubblica that it could take \"weeks, not days\" for the legal issues to be hammered out, adding: But that doesn't mean accepting any delaying tactics. In Italy? Perish the very thought. Meanwhile the Italy Chronicles blog is scathing of the political classes for not dealing with the former prime minister. Here's a flavour: Really, in the view of this Italy observer, the parliamentary commission is completely unnecessary. Berlusconi has been convicted of a crime and he should be removed from parliament automatically with out any vote. Had Italy\u2019s government been in the hands of a Berlusconi coalition, the vote would have been in his favor, thus making a mockery of Italian law and the nation\u2019s constitution. It is not known when the vote on Berlusconi\u2019s parliamentary future will take place, though it is expected before the end of September. If the vote goes against Berlusconi, his immunity from arrest will be removed. This worries Berlusconi considerably as he fears he will be arrested sooner or later, possibly in connection with accusations, confirmed by another senator, of alleged bribery. Rumors that an arrest warrant for Berlusconi has been prepared have been denied by magistrates leading the senator bribery investigation. More here: Stripping Berlusconi Sky News is reporting that ICAP, the world's largest interdealer broker, could be close to paying a \u00a370m fine for its role in the Libor scandal. We've known for some time that ICAP was in talks with US and UK regulators over the affair, in which workers on several trading desks helped to fix the official rate at which banks would lend to each other. But it's the first time that a possible settlement figure has been reported. Via Sky News: One insider said on Monday that ICAP, which is run by Michael Spencer, one of the City's wealthiest men, was closer to finalising a settlement with the FCA than with the US regulators. The civil settlement will be an embarrassment to Mr Spencer, who has consistently sought to downplay the extent of ICAP's involvement in the manipulation of Libor. However, a deal costing the interdealer broker in the region of \u00a370m would not be financially material to ICAP and would be only marginally higher than the projections of City analysts. Spencer is also a former Treasurer of the Conservative Party. A \u00a370m fine would be lower than Barclays (\u00a3290m) or Royal Bank of Scotland (\u00a3390m). It'd be interesting to see if the payment was imposed on the company's bonus pool, as happened with RBS (which is mostly owned by the UK taxpaper). The World Trade Organisation isn't getting carried away by this talk of economic revival. It just cut its forecasts for trade growth, due to Europe's weak economy: The WTO now expects world trade this year to expand by 2.5%, down from 3.3%. It has also lowered its 2014 forecast to 4.5%, from 5%. Reuters has more details: World trade is expected to grow by 2.5% this year and 4.5% in 2014, the World Trade Organization's new chief Roberto Azevedo said on Monday, revising down previous estimates of 3.3% and 5%. Azevedo said the figures will be detailed in a report to be released on September 19. He said the forecasts had been cut because the European Union had been expected to recover in the second quarter of this year, but was now expected to bottom out in the third quarter. Following the sale of Ribena and Lucozade this morning (see 9am) we're pulled together a list of other British food and drink brands that are now owned by overseas firms. From Cadbury to Newcastle Brown Ale, via Weetabix and Branston Pickle, it's a pantry-worth of kitchen favourites: A taste of Britain: UK brands sold overseas Duncan Weldon, senior policy advisor at the TUC (and long-time critic of George Osborne's handling of the economy), isn't convinced by today's speech: Via Andrew Sparrow's liveblog: Here's the full text of George Osborne's speech. And here's the press notice the Treasury has issued. Looking back at Japan, Fung Siu of the Economist Intelligence Unit confirms that Tokyo is hoping for an economic boost from the 2020 Olympics (as mentioned in my opening post at 7.54am), but explains that it may not be felt until 2017: The prime minister has already declared that hosting the Olympics is the fourth arrow of Abenomics. Hosting the games will help boost economic growth in the medium to long-term. The Japanese government is unlikely to launch a complete overhaul of the city's infrastructure. Part of the reason why Tokyo won the bid was because the city's infrastructure was in such good order (compared with the other bids) so the decision is unlikely to impact growth in the short-term. Preparations for the games are likely to begin in earnest from 2017 when there might be a slight increase in real GDP growth. Hosting the games will certainly help keep Japanese economy on a sustainable growth path over the medium to long-term. One more key line from Osborne \u2013 he defended the Bank of England's new 'forward guidance' that UK interest rates aren't going up anytime soon. The chancellor argues that it's wrong to suggest that the guidance has failed because yields on UK government bonds have since risen to a 2-year high (the 10-year yield hit 3% last week). Quite the reverse, he says - rising yields are a sign of confidence in Britain's recovery, which \"vindicates\" the need for forward guidance. The 'counterfactual' is that rates would be even higher without the Bank's new pledge, given all the recent signs that the UK economy is healing. Hang on, though -- it's not that long ago that Osborne was hailing record low bond yields as a sign of faith in Britain's economy.... The nub of George Osborne's speech today (full coverage here on Politics Live) is that those who called for an additional fiscal stimulus to stimulate growth, a Plan B, have \"lost the argument\", and are the \"biggest threat to the economy today\". Osborne's argument is that the UK's economic underperformance since he took office is due to the shock of higher inflation, the eurozone crisis, and the resulting impact on financial conditions. Not the shock of his austerity measures.\uf702 Thus, growth has returned in recent months as those threats eased. Osborne gives the European Central bank some credit, saying the eurozone crisis has \"abated\" following the ECB's actions last summer. In other news, Osborne is also sporting a back-to-school haircut: Chancellor George Osborne has begun his speech on the UK economy in London. As expected, Osborne is arguing that his 'plan A' has pulled the UK out of the crisis, and slamming his critics. The economic collapse was even worse than the thought. Repairing it will take longer than we hoped....but we held our nerve when many urged us to change course. Thanks to the efforts of firms and households, we have turned the corner, Osborne declared. He's now outlining how the UK suffered so badly in the Great Recession because the banking sector had been allowed to expand out out of control, and because public spending rose steadily through the boom years before the credit crunch. \"Truly sustainable\" growth in future, he argues, will depend on 'sound public finances' and well-capitalised banks. My colleague Andrew Sparrow will be covering the whole speech in Politics Live. Confidence over the European recovery continues to rise, with the news this morning that eurozone investors are more optimistic about the situation than any time in the last two years. Sentix's index of eurozone sentiment came in positively for the first time in more than two years in September, with investors saying they are more upbeat about the outlook for Europe. Its monthly reading came in at +6.5 points, the highest reading since May 2011, and up from August's -4.9 points. That's the second-biggest month-on-month improvement since the survey began in 2003, as the graph above shows: Dr Sebastian Wanke, Sentix's senior analyst, called the reading: an explosive coup for the euro zone adding that it was driven by rising confidence in Germany. He said: For Germany, the composite index jumped upward, too, and reached its highest reading since April 2011 which signals a clearly strengthening economy. Good news all round, but also a reminder that sentiment could quickly sour if the recovery should stumble. Last week the ECB trimmed its eurozone growth forecast for 2014 to just 1%, so there's not much leeway. Sentix also warned that sovereign bond prices are expected to fall in the months ahead, pushing up the cost of government borrowing. That's because, \"according to investors, neither central bank policies nor the economy will have a positive influence on bond prices\". Just in: Greece's industrial production is still shrinking, while shop prices remain locked in deflation. New data shows that industrial output dropped by 8.1% year-on-year in July, reversing the 0.6% rise recorded in June. Manufacturing output dropped by 4.3%, while there was a 19.6% plunge in electricity production. As this graph shows, Greece's industrial base is a fifth smaller than before the financial crisis began [more details here] And while prime minister Samaras talks about 'the worst being over' (see 9.38am), retailers are still being forced to slash prices. Consumer prices fell by 1.3% in August, year-on-year, showing deflation is accelerating after July's -0.7% reading. Data last week showed that the fall in Greek GDP was slowing, thanks to a surge in tourism this year. Speaking of Italy, bad debts within its banking sector jumped by 22% year-on-year in July, the latest sign that its economy is deteriorating. The data, from the Bank of Italy, also showed that the Italian credit market remained disfunctional. Loans to households were down by 1.1% during the month, compared with July 2012, while the average interest rate charged to companies borrowing up to \u20ac1m rose from 4.3% to 4.41%. Eurocrisis watch (2): The political crisis in Italy will continue today as a Senate committee meets to consider whether to expel Silvio Berluconi from parliament, following his tax fraud conviction. Tension is high, as Berlusconi's allies say he could bring the country's shaky coalition crashing down, should he be banished from the Senate (as Italian law appears to demand). However, the great survivor of Italian politics could hang on a little longer, with member of Berlusconi's PDL party arguing that he should be spared...for a little longer at least. Reuters has the latest: Berlusconi's lawyers argue that the \"Severino law\", under which convicted politicians are ineligible for parliament, cannot apply in Berlusconi's case because it was passed last year. Berlusconi's lawyers have appealed to the European Court of Human Rights. They want the Senate committee to postpone proceedings until the European Court decides or Italy's constitutional court rules on whether the law is valid. That possibility has been rejected by the PD, which accuses the PDL of trying to waste time with groundless appeals. As the manoeuvres continue, President Giorgio Napolitano, who has played a decisive behind-the-scenes role in Italian politics since the Berlusconi crisis erupted, may play a significant part again. The meeting starts at 3pm local time (2pm BST)... Eurocrisis watch (1): Over the weekend, Greece's prime minister promised the long-suffering Greek people that the recession will soon (finally) be over. Antonis Samaras made the pledge at the annual Thessaloniki trade fair, as our Athens correspondent Helena Smith writes: Boosted by figures showing the economy contracting by 3.8% in the second quarter \u2013 its smallest decline since the outbreak of Athens's worst financial crisis in modern times \u2013 the leader said the country's dependency on foreign lenders was also nearing an end. \"Greece is turning a page \u2026 all the international organisations agree that next year, 2014, will be the year of recovery for the Greek economy,\" he told industry and business leaders attending the annual Thessaloniki trade fair. \"Last year most abroad were predicting that Greece would exit the euro. Now they are predicting the exact opposite. That Greece will exit the recession and stay in the euro,\" he said promising that the progress would hail the end of unpopular austerity. Here's Helena's full story: Worst of Greece's recession is nearly over, says prime minister There was no mention of another aid package for Greece, which some analysts believe will need to be hammered out his autumn. And opposition to Greece's austerity programme has not dissolved. On Saturday night, a demonstration organised by trade unions outside the Trade Fair building was well-attended. And some young demonstrators were detained by police officers after minor clashes broke out: In the corporate world two childhood favourites, Ribena and Lucozade, are changing hands. Japan's Suntory Beverage &amp; Food is taking control of both brands, having just agreed to pay \u00a31.35bn for GSK's soft drinks portfolio (details here). David Redfern, chief strategy officer at GSK, said the deal would help his firm focus on healthcare and pharmaceuticals. He insists that both brands should be safe once the deal goes through: Lucozade and Ribena are iconic brands that have made a huge contribution to GSK over the years, but now is the right time to sell them as we increase the focus of our Consumer Healthcare business and execute the delivery of our late stage pipeline of pharmaceuticals and vaccines. We believe the future of Lucozade and Ribena is in good hands given SBF's established beverages business, ambitious growth plans and also their recognition of the strong performance and capability of the GSK employees working on these products. Reassuring to know that poorly children will still be nursed through a nasty cold with a soothing mug of hot Ribena in future years. The sale is part of a trend of classic British food brands being devoured by foreign investors -- including KP Nuts, Sarson's vinegar and Weetabix. The BBC has rounded up some media reaction to George Osborne's upcoming speech on the economy (which my colleague Andrew Sparrow will cover extensively in his Politics Live blog): \u2022 The Financial Times says it helps him consolidate his stewardship of Britain's finances ahead of the party conferences. \u2022 The Daily Express says his star is rising, and he is widely seen as Prime Minister David Cameron's successor. \u2022 But the Sun has doubts about his assertions. It praises the chancellor for sticking to his policy guns but it says the good news is \"just numbers\" and that \"people don't feel better off\". \u2022 The Daily Mirror calls him \"complacent\" and \"boastful\". More here. In Britain, chancellor George Osborne will declare today that the UK economy has \"turned the corner\", and that critics of his plans have been defeated. Our political editor Patrick Wintour has the details: \"Even if the improving economic news eventually leads to an improvement in the fiscal outlook, the job will not be done,\" he will say in a major speech aimed at setting the parameters of the 2015 election. \"More tough choices will be required after the next election to find many billions of further savings.\" A bullish chancellor will claim that critics of his deficit reduction plans are at a loss to explain why the recovery is now taking place. He will point out that the spending cuts are at their deepest now owing to the backloading of the cuts programme. He will point to evidence that shows in his view \"the last few months have decisively ended [the] controversy\" about fiscal policy \u2013 as those who advocate a so-called plan B cannot explain recent improvements in the economic data. He will say that if he had heeded the advice of the shadow chancellor, Ed Balls, to spend and borrow more, it would have undermined the recovery. Instead he will claim he held his nerve, and that the economy is now recovering. Britain's economy does, indeed, seem to be growing robustly at present \u2013 with GDP rising by 0.7% between April and June. Many economists reckon it picked up pace over the summer. But, with real wages still lagging behind inflation, it does not feel like a recovery to many people. The Labour opposition will hammer this point home today, when Ed Miliband pledges to crack down on zero-hours contracts (where workers aren't guaranteed any minimum paid work). Ed Miliband vows to get tough on zero-hours contracts Spain's IBEX is the worst-performing index in Europe this morning, down almost 1% after Madrid missed out (again) on hosting the Olympics. Although the economic benefits of hosting the Olympics aren't clear, the Spanish must be gutted to be rebuffed for the third time. As my colleague Paul Hamilos writes: And so it was that on Sunday morning, Madrid woke up to the hangover of an economy that continues in crisis, youth unemployment at record levels of 56%, and little to look forward to. The news dominated the headlines on TV and in the papers. \"The great disappointment,\" shouted the front page of El Mundo newspaper, while ABC said \"Goodbye to the Olympic dream\". 2020 Olympics: Madrid disappointed for third time Today's upwardly revised GDP data shows Japan's prime minister Shinzo Abe's first two \"arrows\" - monetary and fiscal stimulus - are hitting their target, argued Rob Wood of Berenberg. However, how about arrow 3 -- structural reforms? No sign of a bullseye yet, Wood says: The signs so far have been disappointing, raising the risks that this spurt of growth in Japan will fizzle out after a year or two. Still, Abe has the opportunity to announce root and branch reforms that would increase competition in parts of Japan\u2019s closeted economy and unleash better productivity growth. He just needs to seize the opportunity as he did with the stimulus. The Japanese Nikkei has closed at a five-week high as the Tokyo stock market enjoyed an Olympics bounce today. Shares rose as traders anticipated increased spending ahead of 2020, and also welcomed the news that Japan's economy grew faster than thought in Q2. The Nikkei surged 2.5%, or 344 points, to 14,205, while the Hong Kong the Hang Seng was up 0.5%. As Nobuhiko Karamochi of Muzuho Securities explained: The GDP data overall was strong, and companies' capital spending in particular stood out. Although we were already assuming that corporate investment would be strong, given recent capital investment data for the April-June quarter, this should bolster sentiment. Asian investors also welcomed the news that China's exports beat exports in August, up 7.2% year-on-year. No bounce in Europe, though, where the main indices are mostly in the red (FTSE 100 down 5 points, and Spain's IBEX shedding 0.8% in early trading). Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and the business world. The week begins with bullish news from Asia, where Japan's economy grew much faster between April and June than first thought. A surge in capital expenditure drove GDP up by 3.8% on an annualised basis (or more than +0.9% quarter-on-quarter), the Cabinet Office reported, up from the first estimate of 2.6%. It's the third successive quarterly rise, and may indicate that prime minister Abe's efforts to reflate the Japanese economy through government spending and a massive stimulus package, are working. Analysts said the cheery news should pave the way for Abe to hike the Japanese sales tax, an effort to push up revenues and make a (small) dent in Japan's debt mountain. Hiroako Muto, senior economist at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management, explained: Companies are replacing old equipment, which led to the large upward revision to GDP. Japan's economic recovery will continue due to strong personal consumption and public works spending. The upward revision means that the government can raise the sales tax as scheduled. The news came as Tokyo was already celebrating being awarded the 2020 Olympic Games \u2013 which offers the promise of further capital expenditure. Evan Lucas, market strategist at IG Markets in Melbourne, reckoned the bill will be somewhere between the \u00a39bn ($13.9bn) spent on the London 2012 games and the \u00a327bn ($43bn) splashed out on Beijing 2008 For an economy that is desperate to snap out of 20 years of deflation this is a huge shot in the arm. It's sparked a decent share rally in Asia overnight, where the Nikkei jumped around 2.5%. More to follow....",

Here's a flavour:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Really, in the view of this Italy observer, the parliamentary commission is completely unnecessary. Berlusconi has been convicted of a crime and he should be removed from parliament automatically with out any vote.</p> <p>Had Italy\u2019s government been in the hands of a Berlusconi coalition, the vote would have been in his favor, thus making a mockery of Italian law and the nation\u2019s constitution. It is not known when the vote on Berlusconi\u2019s parliamentary future will take place, though it is expected before the end of September.</p> <p>If the vote goes against Berlusconi, his immunity from arrest will be removed.</p> <p>This worries Berlusconi considerably as he fears he will be arrested sooner or later, possibly in connection with accusations, confirmed by another senator, of alleged bribery.

This surprised us as we expected little new versus the recent strategy presentation in May. In the event, production guidance for 2014 has been cut by 7% (with a smaller knock-on effect in 2015), highlighting the perils of forecasting. We expect to cut our forecasts by 3%-4%. Despite strong earnings and cash flow growth, on our current forecasts BG is still trading on a 25% PE premium versus the Euro sector in 2017. <br> </blockquote> <p>The company's shares, puffed up last week by vague takeover talk, ended 65p lower at \u00a312.17, the biggest faller in the leading index.</p> <p>Overall, the market fell back after last week's gains, with the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> closing down 16.59 points at 6530.74. Early optimism following strong economic data from China and Japan - and the latter's success in winning the bid to host the 2020 Olympics - was soon overshadowed by renewed concerns about Syria. Friday's poor US non-farm payroll figures left investors wondering when the Federal Reserve would end its $85bn a month bond buying programme, adding to the uncertainty. Michael Hewson at CMC Markets said:</p> <blockquote> Expectations of a positive start for Europe's markets after the recent Chinese and Japanese data soon gave way to the proverbial elephant in the room of Syria, as markets digested weekend comments from President Assad that Syria and its allies would strike back if attacked. <br> While these concerns have restricted any prospect of strong gains and kept Europe's markets on the back foot for most of the day, the likelihood of an imminent strike from the US still looks slim at this stage.  [But] this increasing uncertainty, along with increasing doubts about both the size and timing of a Fed taper after last Friday's disappointing jobs numbers is keeping investors cautious. </blockquote> <p>Miners gained ground following the Chinese, with <strong>Rio Tinto</strong> up 33.5p at 3130.5p and <strong>Anglo American</strong> adding 13.5p to 1594.5p.</p> <p><strong>Glencore Xstrata</strong> tightened its grip on platinum miner <strong>Lonmin</strong> with two of its directors joining the board. The merged mining group holds 24.5% of Lonmin as a legacy of Xstrata's original interest in the business. Now Glencore's Gary Nagle and Paul Smith will join Lonmin as non-executive directors with immediate effect. Analysts at Investec said:</p> <blockquote> It is surprising that board members from Glencore Xstrata had not appointed directors previously, although no doubt the company has been busy progressing its merger with Xstrata. Xstrata had previously wanted to consolidate their ferrochrome, platinum and vanadium assets into Lonmin, such a plan may re-emerge. Glencore Xstrata is to host an analyst day [on Tuesday] that may provide some clarity on its strategy concerning Lonmin. <br> </blockquote> <p>Lonmin dipped 0.6p to 342.1p while Glencore climbed 2.95p to 321.3p.</p> <p><strong>Burberry</strong> rose 35p to \u00a316.35 following an upgrade from HSBC which lifted its price target from \u00a317.50 to \u00a319.00. The bank said:</p> <blockquote> Conservative guidance and cautious sell-side make this stock more solid than it appears. In the short term, the first half trading statement should be fine; long term, strategic initiatives are coming together and digital vision sets the group apart. <br> </blockquote> <p>In the insurance sector <strong>Legal and General </strong>was lifted 3.1p to 193.8p by an outperform rating from Bernstein, while <strong>Aviva</strong> added 8.8p to 399.8p as Morgan Stanley lifted its price target from 403p to 445p. The bank said:</p> <blockquote> In our view, Aviva is delivering on its plan \u2013 we saw clear signs of progress at first half of 2013. In particular, the \u00a3400m non-cash fall in the internal loan should reassure the market. Aviva is now trading on a similar PE to key peers - however, we think the restructuring drives higher than average upside. </blockquote> <p>But <strong>Associated British Foods</strong> fell 33p to \u00a318.18 despite saying its second half profit would be ahead of expectations thanks to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/sep/09/primark-boosts-associated-british-foods-again\" title=\"\">a continuing strong performance from its Primark </a>discount fashion chain. Analysts were concerned about the growth prospects for its sugar business.</p> <p><strong>Tate and Lyle</strong> - which is no longer involved in sugar production - dropped 27.5p to 779.5p on continuing worries about growing competition for its sucralose products, particularly from China. Analysts at UBS moved from neutral to sell and cut their target price from 890p to 770p, saying:</p> <blockquote> We believe Tate's current valuation is too high. It does not adequately reflect the risk that sucralose prices continue to decline as generic competitors improve product quality and access greater scale. Nor, judging by the premium Tate enjoys to close peer Ingredion, does it recognise that ex-sucralose Tate is a horizontally integrated corn processor whose gross margins can be volatile and whose return on capital is significantly below that of branded consumer goods companies. <br> We acknowledge the strength of Tate's balance sheet (likely to be strengthened further by a working capital unwind on the back of a lower corn cost). However, the relatively low dividend payout ratio suggests management would prefer to potentially make acquisitions than return cash to shareholders. </blockquote> <p>Elsewhere <strong>GlaxoSmithKline</strong> slipped 11p to \u00a316.40 as it confirmed the sale of its Ribena and Lucozade brands to Japan's Suntory for \u00a31.35bn.</p> <p>Among the mid-caps, chipmaker <strong>CSR</strong> climbed 22.5p to 517.5p after a positive note from Liberum Capital. Analyst Eoin Lambe said:</p> <blockquote> We upgrade from hold to buy given the recent pull back in the share price. We expect it to meet consensus expectations for the second half but believe there are upside risks to 2014 revenue estimates. New products such as Bluetooth smart, cameras, automotive systems on a chip and Wifi audio in 2014 could lead to stronger than expected revenue growth. <br> We believe 2014 will be the inflection point for Bluetooth smart as it is included in a host of new products (smart watches, keyboards, mice, remote controls, health and fitness). </blockquote> <p>Larger rival <strong>Arm</strong> was also in demand, up 25p at 917.5p.</p> <p><strong>Barratt Developments</strong> ended 13.7p higher at 328.2p as Panmure Gordon raised its recommendation ahead of the housebuilder's latest update. Panmure's Mark Hughes said:</p> <blockquote> Barratt will issue its interim results on Wednesday. The shares have fallen over the summer from their 353p high, and therefore we are now upgrading our recommendation from sell to hold in anticipation of a positive report. Target price 320p (from 300p). <br> </blockquote> <p>Aim-listed oil and gas group <strong>Nostra Terra</strong> lost nearly 4% to 0.395p but traders heard talk the company would soon give a positive update on one of its production prospects.</p> <p>Finally <strong>Edenville Energy</strong> added 5% to 0.2p with 133m shares traded after a positive report on the viability of its coal project in Tanzania. A proposal to construct and operate a small scale mine and power plant, supplying electricity to the local market, has been identified as the best way to proceed.</p>",

This surprised us as we expected little new versus the recent strategy presentation in May. In the event, production guidance for 2014 has been cut by 7% (with a smaller knock-on effect in 2015), highlighting the perils of forecasting. We expect to cut our forecasts by 3%-4%. Despite strong earnings and cash flow growth, on our current forecasts BG is still trading on a 25% PE premium versus the Euro sector in 2017. The company's shares, puffed up last week by vague takeover talk, ended 65p lower at \u00a312.17, the biggest faller in the leading index. Overall, the market fell back after last week's gains, with the FTSE 100 closing down 16.59 points at 6530.74. Early optimism following strong economic data from China and Japan - and the latter's success in winning the bid to host the 2020 Olympics - was soon overshadowed by renewed concerns about Syria. Friday's poor US non-farm payroll figures left investors wondering when the Federal Reserve would end its $85bn a month bond buying programme, adding to the uncertainty. Michael Hewson at CMC Markets said: Expectations of a positive start for Europe's markets after the recent Chinese and Japanese data soon gave way to the proverbial elephant in the room of Syria, as markets digested weekend comments from President Assad that Syria and its allies would strike back if attacked. While these concerns have restricted any prospect of strong gains and kept Europe's markets on the back foot for most of the day, the likelihood of an imminent strike from the US still looks slim at this stage. [But] this increasing uncertainty, along with increasing doubts about both the size and timing of a Fed taper after last Friday's disappointing jobs numbers is keeping investors cautious. Miners gained ground following the Chinese, with Rio Tinto up 33.5p at 3130.5p and Anglo American adding 13.5p to 1594.5p. Glencore Xstrata tightened its grip on platinum miner Lonmin with two of its directors joining the board. The merged mining group holds 24.5% of Lonmin as a legacy of Xstrata's original interest in the business. Now Glencore's Gary Nagle and Paul Smith will join Lonmin as non-executive directors with immediate effect. Analysts at Investec said: It is surprising that board members from Glencore Xstrata had not appointed directors previously, although no doubt the company has been busy progressing its merger with Xstrata. Xstrata had previously wanted to consolidate their ferrochrome, platinum and vanadium assets into Lonmin, such a plan may re-emerge. Glencore Xstrata is to host an analyst day [on Tuesday] that may provide some clarity on its strategy concerning Lonmin. Lonmin dipped 0.6p to 342.1p while Glencore climbed 2.95p to 321.3p. Burberry rose 35p to \u00a316.35 following an upgrade from HSBC which lifted its price target from \u00a317.50 to \u00a319.00. The bank said: Conservative guidance and cautious sell-side make this stock more solid than it appears. In the short term, the first half trading statement should be fine; long term, strategic initiatives are coming together and digital vision sets the group apart. In the insurance sector Legal and General was lifted 3.1p to 193.8p by an outperform rating from Bernstein, while Aviva added 8.8p to 399.8p as Morgan Stanley lifted its price target from 403p to 445p. The bank said: In our view, Aviva is delivering on its plan \u2013 we saw clear signs of progress at first half of 2013. In particular, the \u00a3400m non-cash fall in the internal loan should reassure the market. Aviva is now trading on a similar PE to key peers - however, we think the restructuring drives higher than average upside. But Associated British Foods fell 33p to \u00a318.18 despite saying its second half profit would be ahead of expectations thanks to a continuing strong performance from its Primark discount fashion chain. Analysts were concerned about the growth prospects for its sugar business. Tate and Lyle - which is no longer involved in sugar production - dropped 27.5p to 779.5p on continuing worries about growing competition for its sucralose products, particularly from China. Analysts at UBS moved from neutral to sell and cut their target price from 890p to 770p, saying: We believe Tate's current valuation is too high. It does not adequately reflect the risk that sucralose prices continue to decline as generic competitors improve product quality and access greater scale. Nor, judging by the premium Tate enjoys to close peer Ingredion, does it recognise that ex-sucralose Tate is a horizontally integrated corn processor whose gross margins can be volatile and whose return on capital is significantly below that of branded consumer goods companies. We acknowledge the strength of Tate's balance sheet (likely to be strengthened further by a working capital unwind on the back of a lower corn cost). However, the relatively low dividend payout ratio suggests management would prefer to potentially make acquisitions than return cash to shareholders. Elsewhere GlaxoSmithKline slipped 11p to \u00a316.40 as it confirmed the sale of its Ribena and Lucozade brands to Japan's Suntory for \u00a31.35bn. Among the mid-caps, chipmaker CSR climbed 22.5p to 517.5p after a positive note from Liberum Capital. Analyst Eoin Lambe said: We upgrade from hold to buy given the recent pull back in the share price. We expect it to meet consensus expectations for the second half but believe there are upside risks to 2014 revenue estimates. New products such as Bluetooth smart, cameras, automotive systems on a chip and Wifi audio in 2014 could lead to stronger than expected revenue growth. We believe 2014 will be the inflection point for Bluetooth smart as it is included in a host of new products (smart watches, keyboards, mice, remote controls, health and fitness). Larger rival Arm was also in demand, up 25p at 917.5p. Barratt Developments ended 13.7p higher at 328.2p as Panmure Gordon raised its recommendation ahead of the housebuilder's latest update. Panmure's Mark Hughes said: Barratt will issue its interim results on Wednesday. The shares have fallen over the summer from their 353p high, and therefore we are now upgrading our recommendation from sell to hold in anticipation of a positive report. Target price 320p (from 300p). Aim-listed oil and gas group Nostra Terra lost nearly 4% to 0.395p but traders heard talk the company would soon give a positive update on one of its production prospects. Finally Edenville Energy added 5% to 0.2p with 133m shares traded after a positive report on the viability of its coal project in Tanzania. A proposal to construct and operate a small scale mine and power plant, supplying electricity to the local market, has been identified as the best way to proceed.",

      "bodyText": "Name: TSB. Age: Zero days old. Appearance: Three circles, three letters, no serifs whatsoever. Wait, zero days old? But I've seen TSB on the high street for years. No, you saw Lloyds TSB, the product of a merger that took place in 1995. As of today, TSB is going it alone. Oh right. But why is this happening? It's being sold off, as per a condition by the British government when it bailed out Lloyds TSB in 2008. And, you know, everyone loves a bit of nostalgia. Nostalgia? Yes. TSB hasn't been a British high-street name since the 1990s. It's retro. Who knows, if this is a success then maybe HSBC will turn back into Midland Bank, Santander will turn back into Abbey National and, if we're really lucky, we'll be able to buy Marathons again, not Snickers. Everyone wins. Why on Earth should I bank with TSB? Because, technically, it's a brand new bank completely untainted by all this global financial crisis stuff. TSB didn't try to fraudulently sell you PPI or contribute to the collapse of the economy. Obviously, Lloyds TSB did both of those things, but that was probably down to the mean old Lloyds side. It has a horse for a logo, for Christ's sake. Who'd trust a horse to run a bank? TSB's logo isn't much better, though. It's just circles and letters. Yes, but it's been revamped. It used to be so bulky and authoritarian. Not any more, just look at it! Now it's all sleek and sexy. \"Come here, big boy,\" it says. I'm pretty sure it doesn't say that, actually. No, you're right. I got carried away. It just says TSB. What does TSB stand for, anyway? It used to be Trustee Savings Bank, so presumably that. Not Terrifyingly Sociopathic Berks, then? No. Or Tightfisted Self-Interested Bastards, for that matter. Or Totally Shit Banking? Nope. Or Those Sodding Bankers, This Situation Blows, Tremendous Staff Bonus or Trustworthy? Silly Billy. Aw, this is fun. Yes, we should really do this more. Do say: \"The bank that likes to say yes.\" Don't say: \"The bank that would like to say yes, but the current financial situation means that it has to say no at this time.

      "bodyText": "Deloitte, one of the UK's largest accountancy firms, has been fined a record-breaking \u00a314m for a conflict of interest that occurred when it advised MG Rover Group and the Phoenix Four directors who bought the British carmaker before it collapsed. It is the largest fine issued by the Financial Reporting Council (FRC), the body that regulates accountants, which has also given Deloitte a severe reprimand. Maghsoud Einollahi, a former director of the accountancy firm, was fined \u00a3250,000 and given a three-year ban from accountancy. In a stinging reprimand to Deloitte, the FRC said the sanctions were needed because of the seriousness of the ethical breaches and the substantial benefit that had arisen through the misconduct. The \u00a314m penalty dwarfs a \u00a31.4m fine given to PricewaterhouseCoopers in November 2011 after it wrongly said JPMorgan Chase bank was keeping customer money separately from its own. On Monday the FRC said its report sent \"a strong and clear message\" that all accountants had a responsibility to act in the public interest and comply with their code of ethics. \"The sanctions imposed are in line with the FRC's aim to ensure penalties are proportionate and have the necessary deterrent effect to prevent misconduct and bolster public and market confidence,\" said Paul George, executive director of the FRC. The outcome is one of the final twists in the tale of MG Rover, which was bought in 2000 for \u00a310 by four local businessmen, John Towers, Nick Stephenson, John Edwards and Peter Beale. The Phoenix Four went on to pay themselves and the managing director, Kevin Howe, \u00a342m before the firm collapsed in 2005 with debts of \u00a31.4bn and the loss of around 6,000 jobs.

A Deloitte spokesperson said: \"We remain disappointed with the outcome of the tribunal and disagree with its main conclusions. As a firm, we take our public interest obligations seriously in everything we do. We are disappointed that the efforts we and others made did not successfully secure the long-term future of the MG Rover Group.\" \u2022 This article was amended on 10 September 2013 to correct the figure for MG Rover's debt when it collapsed.",

In the event, production guidance for 2014 has been cut by 7% (with a smaller knock-on effect in 2015), highlighting the perils of forecasting. We expect to cut our forecasts by 3%-4%. Despite strong earnings and cash flow growth, on our current forecasts BG is still trading on a 25% PE premium versus the Euro sector in 2017. The company disappointed the market last year and again in February over its production targets. But last week its shares were lifted by vague takeover speculation. Overall the FTSE 100 has dipped 11.95 points to 6535.38, after last week's positive move. Friday's poor US non-farm payroll figures left investors wondering when the Federal Reserve would end its $85bn a month bond buying programme, adding to the uncertainty. Ishaq Siddiqi at ETX Capital said: Syria and [Fed] tapering concerns [are] being balanced off by the overnight gains in Asian markets after data from China and Japan enthused the market over the outlook for both economies. Data out of China indicated that inflation remained subdued while exports data released Sunday showed a better increase than forecast, painting a better outlook for the second half of 2013 than previous anticipated. After the rocky first half of the year for China, both data points soothed worries about the economic outlook for the world's second largest economy, lifting resource shares in the European session. Meanwhile Japan's second quarter GDP figures were revised up from 0.6% to 0.9%, on top of the country being announced as the host of the 2020 Olympic Games. Following the China figures, miners are among the risers, with Rio Tinto up 40.5p at 3137.5p and Anglo American adding 21p to \u00a316.02. Associated British Foods had fallen 30p to \u00a318.21 despite saying its second half profit would be ahead of expectations thanks to a continuing strong performance from its Primark discount fashion chain. But Burberry has risen 33p to \u00a316.33, pushing it to the top of the FTSE 100, following an upgrade from HSBC which lifted its price target from \u00a317.50 to \u00a319.00. The bank said: Conservative guidance and cautious sell-side make this stock more solid than it appears. In the short term, the first half trading statement should be fine; long term, strategic initiatives are coming together and digital vision sets the group apart. It said Burberry was now an \"HSBC Europe Super Ten stock\", which sounds impressive. Elsewhere GlaxoSmithKline has slipped 8p to \u00a316.43 as it confirmed the sale of its Ribena and Lucozade brands to Japan's Suntory for \u00a31.35bn.",

      "bodyText": "Primark is axing its internet experiment to sell its fashion on the Asos website and is to open one million sq foot of retail space, defying the retail industry switch to online, as its sales continue to surge ahead. While other clothing retailers are pulling away from the high street, the budget clothing chain is opening more stores in the UK and stepping up expansion abroad after revealing that it expects a 22% surge in sales in the year to 14 September. Profit margins were also up as the retailer benefited from lower cotton prices and was able to clear more of its summer ranges thanks to the long spell of warm weather. Desirable fashions such as coloured jeggings, mini-skirts and logo sweatshirts helped boost underling sales to close to 5% for the full year while Primark also gained from opening several new stores. The sales boost came despite Primark's involvement in the high-profile factory disaster in Bangladesh where more than 1,200 workers died when the Rana Plaza building collapsed. John Bason, finance director for the clothing chain's parent company Associated British Foods (ABF), said: \"We believe we are taking share from across the market. Primark is quite differentiated and has got an ever-wider appeal.\" He added that Primark was also benefiting from greater consumer confidence in the UK. \"The pressure on disposable income has clearly come off, it is not getting any worse, but consumers are careful in how they are spending money,\" Bason said. Despite that, Primark is not renewing a trial with online retailer Asos which comes to an end in the next few weeks and does not currently intend to try selling online with other partners or via its own website. Instead, Primark will be improving its website to \"showcase\" products more effectively and to make it more interactive. Bason said the trial with Asos, the fast-growing fashion site, had provided some insight into online retailing and had been a success in terms of sales but \"The best way to get profitable growth is on the high street.\" Primark will open less new space in the UK this financial year but will nearly double the pace of growth abroad as it moves into France with its first store opening in Marseille in December and four more stores by September next year.
