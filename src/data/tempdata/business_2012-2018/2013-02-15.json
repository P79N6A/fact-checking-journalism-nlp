      "body": "<p>When Warren Buffett, the investor known as the Oracle of Omaha, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2013/feb/14/warren-buffett-berkshire-heinz-3g-capital\">agreed to buy beloved ketchup and baked-beans maker Heinz for $23bn on Thursday</a>, it seemed like the perfect corny American love story. Buffett, a billionaire many times over, is known for his unassuming style and his love of Cherry Coke and hamburgers, while Heinz is synonymous with cookouts and mankind's most perfect food, french fries. </p> <p>Unfortunately, it did not take long for thunderclouds to gather over this festive barbecue of a deal. </p> <p>On Friday, the Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating whether someone was tipped off about the deal early and <a href=\"http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2013/02/14/s-e-c-is-said-to-be-investigating-trading-before-heinz-deal/\">tried to make money on the information</a>.</p> <p>When someone connected to a big merger gets information before it's public, and then buys a company's stock to make money on it, that's known as insider trading. It is part of the SEC's job to chase people who commit the crime, but it's not easy. Insider trading is rampant and the SEC has long been too poor to do the job right. As a result, it has often caught the smallest fish \u2013 the guys dumb enough to get caught \u2013 instead of the brilliant masterminds among big hedge funds and investors that could outsmart the law.</p> <p>Over the past three years, prosecutors including New York's Preet Bharara have had more success tracking down alleged insider trading at hedge funds including Galleon by approaching it as they would a mafia case: elaborate, technology-savvy operations that include email scanning and wiretaps. </p> <p>Still, you don't need a Homeland-like setup of surveillance screens, Bloomberg trading terminals and flowcharts to know if a merger shows suspicious evidence of insider trading. You can play along and spot the main forensic giveaways at home. You only need the internet and the free stock charts you can get through <a href=\"http://www.google.com/finance\">Google Finance</a>, <a href=\"http://finance.yahoo.com/\">Yahoo Finance</a> and MarketWatch's <a href=\"http://bigcharts.marketwatch.com/\">BigCharts.com</a>. </p> <p>Let's call it CSI: Heinz. The best part is that you don't need any math to be the star of this show. You just need the ability to spot unusually big numbers lurking among smaller ones. </p> <p>The first number is usually the stock price. The first thing that gives away potential insider trading is a giant jump in the stock the day before a merger is announced. The number of shares bought and sold \u2013 which is known as the volume of the stock \u2013 is also important. </p> <p>Heinz's stock price has been pretty pokey; it may well have been the most drama-free major stock in America before all of this excitement. For instance, <a href=\"http://www.google.com/finance?q=NYSE%3AHNZ&amp;ei=m1keUfirDojGwAPfgwE\">here is a stock chart showing Heinz stock over the past five days</a>. What it shows is that Heinz was completely flat at around $60 a share until the morning when Buffett's investing conglomerate, Berkshire Hathaway, agreed to join with investment firm 3G to pay $72.50 a share. There is an immediate sharp upward \"cliff\" in the stock on the morning of the announcement. That indicates that no one was moving the stock on inside information. Heinz doesn't show much evidence of insider trading by the criteria of stock price. (That doesn't mean there wasn't any, just that we have to keep looking harder.)</p> <p>However, there's another stock-related number to check. All of the stock-trading sites have a category called Vol/Avg, which tells you the number of shares traded that day, as well as the average number of shares traded over time. Heinz's stock chart shows that on average, 3.56 million of its shares are traded on any given day. On Friday, however, more than 6 million shares traded hands; yesterday, when the deal was announced, more than 64 million shares of Heinz were zooming back and forth across stock exchanges. That shows that a <em>lot</em> of people were interested in buying and selling the stock, which is completely normal when a big deal is announced. </p> <p>The key is to look at the volume on the day before the deal is announced. If no one knows a merger is coming, then the volume should be around the average. </p> <p>If we're looking for obvious evidence of insider trading, we're out of luck on the stock volume too. <a href=\"http://bigcharts.marketwatch.com/\">MarketWatch's BigCharts.com</a> has \"historical quotes\", which tell you how the stock traded on any given day in the past. On 13 February, before the merger announcement, there were 3.48 million shares of Heinz changing hands. That's below the average volume, which indicates sluggish interest in the stock. </p> <p>No clear evidence of insider trading there. At this rate, CSI: Heinz looks close to being cancelled. </p> <h2>A boring stock? Not necessarily</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-404181765\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/2/15/1360959843912/Traders-work-at-the-post--010.jpg\" alt=\"Traders work at the post that trades HJ Heinz Co on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Traders work at the post that trades HJ Heinz Co on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. Photograph: Brendan Mcdermid/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It also doesn't help us that Heinz has been such a boring stock that speculators, like hedge funds, have not been very much interested in it before now. In this case, according to Yahoo and Google, the top 10 holders of Heinz stock are venerable firms like Vanguard, BlackRock and Federated Investors. These firms, which you may find in your 401k, tend to buy stocks and hold them. Heinz has been too dowdy to attract hedge-fund thrill-seekers, which explains why the stock price and the volume have been so flat for so long. </p> <p>OK, so the stock price, the volume of shares and the owners don't give us much evidence that there was insider trading. It's all very Mayberry RFD, just another pokey week in a pokey stock. Do you give up? Change the channel? No. Hang in there. The juicy part is yet to come. </p> <p>At this point, the professionals look at something a little more complicated: the options. Options are a way for sophisticated investors to speculate on the future of a stock. Options let them bet on what the price of Heinz \u2013 or Dell, or Exxon \u2013 will be in a given month. </p> <p>An investor may believe, for instance, that Heinz stock will be near $55 in June. The $55 is known as the \"strike price\". The other number you need to know about options charts is \"open interest\". This indicates how many options contracts are bet at that price. It sounds complicated, but it's an easy number to understand: it's like counting the number of chips on a poker table. The more open interest, the more bets are being placed. </p> <p>The key with options, like with stocks, is to look for numbers that look unusually high. In this case, the big numbers are going to be in the \"Open Interest\" column of the Heinz options charts, <a href=\"http://bigcharts.marketwatch.com/quickchart/options.asp?sid=2371&amp;symb=hnz\">which are called options chains</a>.</p> <p>Now you have to use some forensic reasoning. Buffett's offer was $72.50, so if anyone was tipped off about the price of the deal, they'd want to buy a lot of Heinz options at a strike price of $70. ($60 would be too low and $75 would be too high.) But that didn't happen. You can click on the February, March and June options charts and find that the $70 price didn't have too much unusual activity \u2013 maybe a little more, but nothing crazy. </p> <p>However, what stands out in the stream of numbers is this: all of a sudden, the day before the deal, the Heinz options snoozefest suddenly started to snort to life. A lot of people showed interest in buying Heinz at $65 a share in June. </p> <p>An easy chart at <a href=\"http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2013-02-14/so-who-leaked-heinz-deal\">ZeroHedge</a> highlights what happened on 13 February, the day before the Heinz deal was announced: 2,593 options contracts were opened, betting that Heinz stock would be worth at least $65 in June. (The ZeroHedge chart shows a slightly higher number, but 2,593 is where it ended up). According to the estimates of one trader, that number of contracts would have affected about 250,000 shares of Heinz \u2013 a pretty significant number. </p> <p>Maybe it was just a lucky guess? Maybe someone just had that much faith in the stock? It could have been. But there didn't seem to be much reason to believe that Heinz, that pokey, sleepy stock, would suddenly turn into a star. <br>Heinz's stock chart over five years <a href=\"http://www.google.com/finance?q=hnz&amp;ei=gmMeUZCnDeSrwAOXaA\">shows that it has never lurched higher than around $60</a> \u2013 until the day Buffett announced his offer. </p> <p>Also, there's the timing of it. One Wall Street trader who was watching the options told me that the first bunch of options contracts moved at 2:22pm on 13 February, with another batch at 3:03pm. In trading hours, that was only three hours before the Heinz takeover was announced. </p> <p>Now things are getting warm. To use the terminology of the CSI shows, there's enough there to start asking whether there may have been a premeditated move. </p> <p>\"Is it suspicious? Yes. Is it, 'Holy crap I've never seen anything like this before?' I'm not so sure,\" said a veteran Wall Street trader who bets on the prices of companies involved in mergers and acquisitions. But he saw no reason to assume that the options trading in Heinz was purely coincidental: \"The SEC should be knocking on the door.\"</p>",

    "webTitle": "Wool renaissance boosts UK suppliers", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "In the foothills of the Snowy Mountains of New South Wales, the grazing merino sheep are on the frontline of a renaissance in British wool manufacturing that is being championed by everyone from Prince Charles to Victoria Beckham. From Australia, the wool is shipped to mills dotted through Yorkshire, Lancashire and the Scottish Highlands, where expert weavers and dyers are turning out some of the finest cardigans, scarves and suits in the world. Just 30 years ago, the UK wool market was on its knees and a once thriving industry that had more than 130 mills, employing 50,000 workers, looked likely to die as retailers turned to cheaper suppliers. Meanwhile a shift to more casual attire meant that, even in the City, tailored woollen suits fell out of favour. However, in the past five years wool has made a comeback, with annual sales soaring 50% from \u00a3180m in 2007 to \u00a3270m last year. It now provides employment for 5,000 in around 40 fully functioning mills, with production up 12% in a year. Experts put this down to demanding middle classes in emerging markets, a swing back to sharp suits and knitted jumpers (think Mad Men, James Bond and The Killing) and a more conscientious customer keen to know the exact journey of their favourite winter coat. James Sugden, of the manufacturer Johnstons of Elgin, where he has spent 25 year as managing director, explained: \"I've been in this industry for 40 years and we are busier now than I have ever seen because although we can't compete on price we can compete on quality. \"It's a bit like Scottish whisky \u2013 we've got a great iconic brand that is perfect for the growing middle classes in emerging markets. If you go to Edinburgh and walk along the Royal Mile, you'll see Chinese tourists buying bundles of high-quality scarves to take home with them.\" More than 70% of wool products made in the UK now end up abroad and fashion houses from around the world are keeping a close eye on the market, including Chanel, which bought the Scottish Barrie Knitwear cashmere mill out of administration last year. The revival has brought with it recognition from the Prince of Wales, who launched the Campaign for Wool in 2010 with the blessing of designers, manufacturers and, seemingly, the public. It has led to the reintroduction of the International Woolmark prize, which gave early recognition to young Yves Saint Laurent and Karl Lagerfeld in the 1950s. Organisers of this year's award have secured judges including Victoria Beckham and Donatella Versace, for the ceremony which takes place on Saturday. Stuart McCullough, chief executive of the Woolmark Company, said: \"There are now more UK mills working with high quality merino wool than there have been for many years and they are now coping with more demand that they have seen for many decades.\" High-street retailers have also come on board, with Marks &amp; Spencer, John Lewis, Topshop and Paul Smith all having introduced British-made woollen garments once more. Sugden said: \"I think consumers like to know more and more the story of who makes their clothes. We have mill tours with queues of people wanting to see how it is made and there is a whole education process around manufacturing.\" The industry appears to be strengthening and manufacturers, which are nearly all independently owned and with a commitment to creating local jobs, have adapted and expanded. Yorkshire-based Abraham Moon &amp; Sons recently opened a new warehouse and, in Leeds, Laxtons has invested in a new mill. The next stage for the industry is to train a new generation of dyers, weavers and spinners. And with the fashion industry squarely behind them, the British wool-makers appear to have every chance of future success.",

It has led to the reintroduction of the International Woolmark prize, which gave early recognition to young Yves Saint Laurent and Karl Lagerfeld in the 1950s.</p> <p>Organisers of this year's award have secured judges including Victoria Beckham and Donatella Versace, for the ceremony which takes place on Saturday.</p> <p>Stuart McCullough, chief executive of the Woolmark Company, said: \"There are now more UK mills working with high quality merino wool than there have been for many years and they are now coping with more demand that they have seen for many decades.\"</p> <p>High-street retailers have also come on board, with Marks &amp; Spencer, John Lewis, Topshop and Paul Smith all having introduced British-made woollen garments once more.</p> <p>Sugden said: \"I think consumers like to know more and more the story of who makes their clothes. We have mill tours with queues of people wanting to see how it is made and there is a whole education process around manufacturing.\"</p> <p>The industry appears to be strengthening and manufacturers, which are nearly all independently owned and with a commitment to creating local jobs, have adapted and expanded.</p> <p>Yorkshire-based Abraham Moon &amp; Sons recently opened a new warehouse and, in Leeds, Laxtons has invested in a new mill. The next stage for the industry is to train a new generation of dyers, weavers and spinners.</p> <p>And with the fashion industry squarely behind them, the British wool-makers appear to have every chance of future success.</p>",

These have barely moved, even as the story has developed from a cue for jokes on Twitter to a scandal about the safety of the European food chain. The City's complacency is perhaps understandable. The job of analysts is to guess where profits and share prices are heading, especially in the short term. On that score, it's a safe bet that consumers will continue to shop in supermarkets; they may buy less processed meat but they do have to eat. Do not expect to see an immediate hit to sales or profits. But the long-term impact could be very different. It now looks as if the end of the road has been reached for supermarkets' \"divide and rule\" approach to their supply base. Tesco chief executive Phil Clarke in effect conceded as much on Friday as he ordered a review of how relationships with suppliers can be made \"more transparent and collaborative\". That's not quite an admission that too many of Tesco's relationships are obscure and hostile \u2013 but it's not far off. The substitution of horsemeat for beef is, of course, fraud \u2013 and, in that regard, it's fair for supermarkets to portray themselves as victims. At the same time, however, criminal acts are more likely to succeed if meat is passed through multiple hands before it arrives on supermarket shelves. That's the problem the retailers now have to confront. And, to judge from Downing Street's hostile comments about supermarket bosses' \"unacceptable\" silence, the government is not keen to shoulder much responsibility itself. For the big retailers, a bill will arrive in some form \u2013 and the impact of a subtle shift in pricing power back towards high-quality producers should not be underestimated. \u2009 Is Vodafone's dividend vulnerable? It's not (yet) a deal or even an offer, but Vodafone's income-loving investors should be on red alert. A \u20ac10bn-ish purchase of Kabel Deutschland would be a chunky outlay for a company that was supposed to be showering its own shareholders with cash. It might also signal the moment when chief executive Vittorio Colao is obliged to spell out how much his new taste for cable assets could cost and how he intends to pay. Last year's cable deal was innocuous. At \u00a31bn, Cable &amp; Wireless Worldwide was small enough to get lost in the wash and Vodafone's timing was commendably opportunistic. Bidding for Germany's largest cable company, on the other hand, could only be considered \"strategic,\" which normally implies a strategic problem. It's not hard to guess its nature. In a joined-up digital world, a wireless-only phone operator such as Vodafone risks being under-equipped for battle. Exhibit A is the iPad, where many purchasers don't bother to install a 3G internet connection on their new gadget: they're happy instead to do their downloading at home on a cheaper all-you-can-eat wi-fi tariff. So the bumper returns Vodafone once expected from mobile data traffic may be threatened. Getting big in cable would relieve the headache. It's just that Colao has been vague about his ambitions. It will make sense in some markets to buy; sometimes it will be better to invest; sometimes leasing wholesale capacity will be the way to go. All options are open, then. Is the same true of the proceeds from Verizon Wireless? That's the worry among shareholders who have waited patiently to see this prized 45%-owned US asset produce dividends. There have been two crops so far. But the first time Vodafone gave its shareholders a special dividend; the second time it chose a share buy-back. Significant? Well, buy-backs can always be halted should a strategic need arise, say the doubters. In the meantime, the arithmetic on the ordinary dividend is tight. Ignoring Verizon, free cash flow should be \u00a35.3bn this year. But the dividend costs \u00a34.8bn. That's uncomfortable, especially given Vodafone's struggles in southern Europe. And if cable assets now have to be bought or secured, the numbers look even more challenging. Clarity, please, Mr Colao, your investors are getting nervous. A 6% dividend yield is a fine thing \u2013 but only if it is safe. Drinks deal languishes \u2009The idea of a competition inquiry into our big banks has inexplicably failed to excite government ministers. Do not fear, though, the Office of Fair Trading has its finger on the pulse of the burning competition question: will drinkers of Irn Bru and Orangina be disadvantaged if the manufacturer, AG Barr, combines with Britvic, the Fruit Shoot folk? Yes, this modest \u00a31.4bn merger really was dispatched to the Competition Commission this week. The presence in the soft drinks market of Coca-Cola Enterprises and a battalion of supermarkets with vigorous own-label operations didn't impress the market purists at the OFT. Boffins at the commission will now spend up to six months exploring the interplay between Coke's Fanta, Britvic's Tango and Barr's Orangina. What a waste of time. Coca-Cola Enterprises in Britain would still be twice the size of a Britvic/Barr combo, which is the statistic that ought to have killed the theorising. Indeed, the prosperity of Barr \u2013 the junior partner in the proposed deal but the one with greater dynamism \u2013 is something to celebrate. In Scotland, Irn Bru gives Coke a run for its money. Most consumers, one suspects, would be happy for Barr's management to be given a chance to square up to the US giant across the UK armed with a bigger portfolio of brands. And, let's not forget, nobody is forced to consume any of these sticky products. The other hope was that a merged Britvic/Barr might be a mini-national champion, a company more capable of generating export revenues. Educating continentals in the subtleties of Irn Bru seemed a challenge and a half, but the combo ought to be allowed to try. After all, most soft drinks firms are multinationals these days. But the deal has now lapsed, which is often a prelude to collapse. \"If this is government industrial policy, I'm going to take French lessons,\" reflected Gerald Corbett, chairman of Britvic.

      "bodyText": "Japan will escape censure from the G20 group of nations meeting in Moscow this weekend despite widespread unease at Tokyo's aggressive intervention into currency markets to drive down the value of the yen. It is understood that pressure from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and several prominent G20 members has kept any reference to Japan's attempts to depress the yen out of a communique due to be released on Saturday. A draft communique seen by Reuters suggests that Tokyo would not be singled out for criticism, as had been suggested. An unnamed delegate was quoted as saying: \"There wasn't anybody putting Japan on the spot. That's quite frankly a bit of a surprise.\" IMF boss Christine Lagarde dismissed the possibility of an international currency conflict, saying that \"the current talk of currency war is overblown\". She said an assessment by the IMF \"does not indicate any major deviation from the fair value of major currencies\". Japan's incoming government of Shinzo Abe has spoken openly of the need to drive down the value of the yen to help firms such as Panasonic and Sony export goods more cheaply. Some European countries have accused Tokyo of signalling its intention to buy billions of euros in order to drive up the value of the eurozone currency. In a barely disguised swipe at Japan, US Treasury undersecretary Lael Brainard warned the world's biggest economies against taking unilateral steps when it comes to exchange rates. \"All the members of G20 need to deliver on a commitment to move towards a market-determined exchange rate and refrain from competitive devaluation,\" he said. The G20 has previously asked nations to refrain from market intervention. Finance ministers, including the UK chancellor George Osborne, and central bank chiefs are meeting in Moscow under the chairmanship of Vladimir Putin's Russian government to discuss how to support the global recovery ahead of a leaders meeting later in the year. The pound has fallen 20% against the dollar and euro since the financial crisis, though with little of the hoped-for boost to exports. Bank of England policymaker Martin Weale said on Friday that the benefits could merely be delayed as exporters begin the process of turning to growing markets and away from recession-hit continental Europe. Weale, a member of the bank's interest-rate setting committee, said the cheaper currency could still bring rewards, though he warned that a fall in foreign investment income could bring another drop in the exchange rate. He said that while this will raise import prices and spur inflation, it could support exporters further and help re-balance the UK economy away from financial services and towards manufacturing.",

      "bodyText": "Shares in Tullett Prebon fell nearly 6% on Friday after unconfirmed reports that conversations involving a broker at the firm had been cited by regulators investigating Libor fixing allegations. Tullett refused to comment on claims that \"broker F\" at \"broker firm C\" \u2013 mentioned in a penalty notice issued by the Financial Services Authority against UBS \u2013 was a reference to an individual at the money-broking group. The claims were made in an article in the Financial Times, which did not name its sources. The same report also alleged that Tullet was \"broker firm 3\" referred to in an FSA settlement this month with Royal Bank of Scotland over Libor fixing. The broker firm, which publishes its full-year results next month, saw its shares fall as low as 266.4p at one point as the stock slipped by more than 10%. They finished the day down 17.8p, or 5.9%, at 282.8p. Tullett was not immediately able to confirm the FT report. There is no suggestion it is one of the banks or broker firms under investigation by either the FSA or Serious Fraud Office for involvement in Libor fixing. A spokesperson said: \"Tullett Prebon has never been informed by the FSA or any other regulatory authority that Tullett Prebon or any of its brokers are under investigation in relation to Libor.\" Tullett's chief executive Terry Smith has been one of the most outspoken advocates of criminal prosecutions for anyone found to have attempted to fix Libor rates. In June last year, he said on his blog: \"For the record, my view [is] that the banks do not have any integrity left and that criminal proceedings should be instituted against those who had manipulated Libor.\" In the same blog he also sought to remind readers of the difference between banks, where traders work, and firms such as Tullett, which provide broker services. \"By the way, for the information of some of the Tweeters who railed against me as a banker, I'm not.

In December two men who had been at broker firm RP Martin were among those who had their homes raided as part of an SFO investigation. They were later released, without charge, after questioning. Last month Icap, another interdealer broker, was brought into the FSA probe into alleged manipulation. It has suspended one employee and put three others on administrative leave while investigations continue. Responding to the FT claims, Gary Greenwood, an analyst at Shore Capital, said: \"To date, Tullett has denied any wrongdoing and, unlike its larger rival Icap, has not yet suspended or placed any employees on administrative leave. \"While it appears increasingly likely that the interdealer brokers may have been complicit in Libor rigging, the fact that they are not directly involved in the rate setting process means that we believe any potential fines/penalties will be considerably lower than those levied on the guilty banks ...

      "bodyText": "A project launched by David Cameron to place small businesses in disused government buildings is on the verge of failure, the Treasury's most senior civil servant has disclosed. A year after the prime minister announced he would make 300 empty state-owned properties available to entrepreneurs, a leaked letter has revealed that not a single building has been occupied. Nick Macpherson, the Treasury's permanent secretary, wrote that many of the buildings that Cameron claimed would become bustling offices were too small, in poor condition or had restrictive leases preventing their use by anyone outside government. Only four properties out of the original 300 could be used by small businesses soon but those deals have yet to be finalised, he added. Labour said the disclosure was proof that the scheme was ill-conceived and expensive. Chukka Umunna, the shadow business secretary, said: \"Sadly this idea seems to have gone the same way as so many of the government's schemes supposed to be helping businesses which have been beset by chaos, delay and ministers' failure to deliver.\" Cameron launched the scheme in January 2012 during a visit to north-east England. Beforehand, Downing Street press officers briefed journalists that he would be making a major announcement about disused government properties. \"The first priority for the ones we aren't using is to sell them off, but in the meantime, many are going to be sitting idle. So let's match the capacity we've got with the need that's out there. Let's provide office space where we can to those who can use it,\" the prime minister said. Some of these buildings had become empty because of cuts to the public payroll, he said. As well as helping entrepreneurs, the initiative would give a much-needed boost to Treasury finances, officials claimed. \"Enterprise is what we do in Britain. This is the year that, more than ever, we've got to go for it,\" Cameron added. Macpherson's letter, which was sent to the public accounts committee two weeks ago, details the efforts made by Cabinet Office and Treasury civil servants to make the scheme work over the last year. Macpherson wrote that a number of early problems were identified. \"As expected, not all of the government's property was suitable for this initiative. During the past year some of those spaces from the original headline figure have been handed back to landlords or sold.\" Macpherson said the government had been running a pilot scheme that has reviewed 145 surplus government properties in 95 locations and tried to identify suitable providers to manage the buildings. \"Of the spaces that remain, there are a variety of reasons for not being able to use them. Reasons for this include: being very small; poor condition; security considerations; restrictive leases terms preventing their use outside government; and some not being available long enough to make them viable or worthwhile for potential providers to manage,\" he said. After another three months the pilot project had identified just 20 suitable properties, Macpherson said. These were in Birmingham, Bolton, Bristol, Colchester, Rugby, Crewe, Blackpool, Berkeley, Beverley, Leeds, Bedford, Nottingham, Northampton, Oxford, Peterborough, Waterlooville, Wimbledon and Runcorn. Between May and July, the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills ran a procurement study for these projects, and added four more possible properties. Macpherson said the response to the procurement process was encouraging with expressions of interest from 60 people. But just eight properties received bids. \"Of the eight spaces, two properties were subsequently withdrawn pending disposal; two were considered unviable by the bidders after further consideration; and four are currently in contract negotiation,\" Macpherson said. One of the reasons for the low number of bids appeared to be because the government stipulated that management of the spaces should be self-funding, he said. Asked to respond to the letter, the Treasury passed the Guardian's queries on to the Cabinet Office, which did not respond to queries about how many civil servants staff hours have been spent working on the project, and a request for an estimate of the total cost of the project. A Cabinet Office spokesperson said: \"We are acting on our commitment to provide vacant government space to SMEs (Small and medium enterprises) to help them grow. Several government departments have identified locations with potential, and we are carefully assessing bids from providers to run some of the buildings in the first phase of this initiative.\"",

Thanks for all the comments, have a good weekend and we'll be back on Monday. There are apparently reports from Germany that the total bailout needed for Cyprus is just over \u20ac16bn, a little lower than previous talk of \u20ac17bn. Cyprus is also going to the polls this weekend. And here's something to look out for next week. Late on Valentine's Day, Moody's proved there is no love lost between ratings agencies. The company downgraded McGraw Hill - owner of rival rating agency Standard &amp; Poor's - from A3 to Baa2 with a negative outlook. Part of the reason was said to be the recent lawsuits filed against S&amp;P by the Department of Justice over its rating of risky mortgages ahead of the financial crisis. PSA Peugeot Citroen unions agreed to let the French carmaker start to move workers from its troubled Aulnay plant, effectively beginning the wind-down of the site a year ahead of its scheduled closure, reports Reuters: The works council approved the transfers to another Paris area plant in response to violence and threats against staff ignoring a strike call by the leftwing CGT, said Denis Martin, Executive Vice President of industrial operations. Full story here. Gold is being hit hard today, down around 2% to a six month low of just over $1602 as investors cash in recent gains amid growing optimism this year that key economies such as the US and China are picking up. And Bloomberg is reporting that George Soros, who often gets these things right, and fellow billionaire Louis Moore Bacon had cut their stakes in gold-back exchange-traded products in the last quarter. Some pictures from the G20 meeting are coming in now, including one of chancellor George Osborne and a nicely understated car. The EU has called off a proposed visit to Macedonia next week, Reuters reports: The European Union's enlargement commissioner cancelled a visit to Macedonia next week over a political dispute that he warned could undermine the ex-Yugoslav republic's bid to start membership talks with the bloc. Macedonia's main opposition Social Democrats have been boycotting parliament since they were thrown out of the assembly by security during a brawl in late December. The full report is here. More data from the US. Consumer sentiment improved in February, amid signs of increased job hiring. The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan index rose to 76.3 from 73.8 in January, better than the reading of 74.8 expected by economists. Households with incomes of below $75,000 were among the most optimistic, said survey director Richard Curtin, \"with expected gains in employment more than offsetting declines in after-tax incomes due to the end of the payroll tax cut.\" Of course the US still has to come to an agreement in the next couple of weeks over planned spending cuts and tax rises. If they both kick in, consumer confidence may well take another hit. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said on the industrial production figures; At first glance, industrial production data provide further signs that the US economy got off to a disappointing start to the year, but a small drop in output needs to be looked at in the context of strong growth in prior months, confirming messages from business surveys that the underlying trend in the economy remained one of firm growth in January. And with that I will hand over the blog to Nick Fletcher. Thanks for all your comments and have a lovely weekend. US industrial production dropped unexpectedly in January, weighed down by weak manufacturing and mining. Industrial output dropped 0.1% over the month, compared with a rise of 0.4% in December, and expectations of a rise of 0.2%. But Markit points out that the three-month trend is positive, with production rising by 1.6% compared with the previous three months. Just back to the eurozone trade figures briefly (see 10.14am), which showed a healthy-looking surplus in December. Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight notes that the underlying picture was not so encouraging as both exports and imports fell appreciably in December and over the fourth quarter of 2012. He writes: This suggests that the markedly increased 0.6% quarter-on-quarter drop in Eurozone GDP in the fourth quarter of 2012 was significantly influenced by a weakened export performance. Meanwhile, the appreciable drop in Eurozone imports is consistent with weakened Eurozone domestic demand in the fourth quarter. Fed chairman Ben Bernanke is now speaking at the G20. He says a strong US economy equals a strong world economy. The US is acting in line with the position of the Group of Seven nations, he says, by using domestic policy tools to boost growth and reduce unemployment. Consistent with the G7 policy statement, the US is using domestic policy tools to advance domestic objectives. Russian president Vladimir Putin, meanwhile, told the Group of 20 nations that it was vital to eliminate economic imbalances and have a clear strategy on borrowing to put the global economy on a sustainable growth path. The days when economic crises had an isolated impact are gone. Problems in the US and the eurozone affect each country's economy. Now IMF chief Christine Lagarde is up. She too says talk of currency wars is \"overblown\". Yes, the euro has appreciated and yes the yen has depreciated, but that is the result of good policies in the eurozone and looser policy in Japan. There is no major deviation from fair value of major currencies. The G20 draft will make not mention a commitment to not target foreign exchange rates, Reuters is reporting, citing a G20 delegate. Headlines on the wires suggest the latest draft communique will repeat previous language on avoiding excessive foreign exchange volatility and disorderly movements in foreign exchange rates. But the G20 deputies did not single out Japan in their disucssions about the communique, the G20 delegate said. Reuters says the draft also reaffirms commitments to medium-term fiscal plans but says some countries need to take into account near-term considerations. It does not include this week's G7 language on the need to use fiscal and monetary policies only for domestic objectives. The (remarkably talkative) G20 delegate said the deputies debated whether fiscal consolidation has been too aggressive or whether the lack of fiscal consolidation has led to too much uncertainty. Very few pictures coming through from the meeting, but here's the OECD's Angel Gurria giving Russia's finance minister a big hug. Back to Portugal, where the prime minister is sounding downbeat about the country's prospects this year. Pedro Passos Coelho suggested the government may have to cut its forecasts for this year, saying: The [fourth quarter] results leave us with a level of foreign demand that, if extended into 2013, will not allow us to maintain the projections we have made. Portugal is in its third year of recession, as it labours under a crippling austerity programme imposed by the country's international lenders. Meanwhile, over in Moscow, the governor of the Bank of Japan Masaaki Shirakawa is saying countries must be aware of the impact of domestic policies on the rest of the world. While the head of the OECD Angel Gurria tells CNBC we are further away today from a currency war then we were two or three years ago. Here's our economics editor, Larry Elliott, on the UK retail sales figures. He says, while you can blame the snow for some things, the real reason behind poor sales is that consumers don't have the money to splash out. More online shortly... The best explanation of all, therefore, is the most obvious one: consumers are skint. Real incomes, according to the ONS, are back to 2003 levels, and with petrol prices again rising sharply there is simply less money available for discretionary spending. But isn\u2019t this inconsistent with an improving labour market, which should be leading to an increase in aggregate incomes? Not at all. Rising employment masks two big trends: the increase in part-time work and the willingness of workers to accept cuts in real (inflation-adjusted) pay in order to avoid losing their jobs. As a result, spending power for millions of Britons is weak and is likely to remain so. That\u2019s why the ONS is reporting that the proportion of on-line sales remained above the 10% mark in January. Normally, there is a spike in internet buying in December as consumers load up on CDs, books and clothes for Christmas presents, and then the percentage falls back. This year it has remained high, a sign that Britain has not lost the spending habit but is being forced to shop around for bargains. Brazil's finance minister Guido Mantega is now making his voice heard over in Moscow at the G20. He says Brazil will not allow an over-appreciation of the real. Mantega is thoguht to have coined the term \"currency wars\" to describe the series of competitive devaluations adopted by rich nations to bolster their exports to the detriment of emerging market nations. Reuters reports: Since then Brazil has actively sought to depreciate its currency, the real, to protect local manufacturers of everything from shoes to suits and make its exports more competitive. It has taken bold action to curb speculative capital inflows with higher taxes. [Clarification: Using the monthly figures (as usual) apologies to those who prefer yearly statistics] The eurozone trade surplus widened in December, with imports falling at a faster rate than exports. Eurostat said the unadjusted trade surplus was \u20ac11.7bn in December. That is higher than the \u20ac8bn a year earlier, but lower than forecasts for a rise to \u20ac13.1bn. The biggest single improvement was in Italy, which swung to a \u20ac9bn surplus in the first 11 months of 2012, from a deficit of almost \u20ac27bn a year earlier. Chris Williamson of Markit is more upbeat. While the snow clearly had an impact on sales, the decline was nothing like as severe as we've seen in previous years. For example, the 0.6% decline in January compared with a 1.9% monthly fall in December 2010, when the country was also hit by heavy snow. The data therefore add to other survey evidence which suggests the economy got off fairly lightly from snow disruption, further allaying fears of a weather-related \"triple dip\" recession. We should also remember that retail sales are not used in the calculation of the first estimates of GDP, which the PMIs suggest is still on source to recover from the downturn seen late last year. Rob Wood of Berenberg Bank agrees that the snow is not the whole picture. The snow problem shouldn\u2019t disguise the real problem, however. The underlying picture is that the economy is bouncing along the bottom, so weather disruptions can easily tip it into negative territory. The underlying story is a familiar one for UK households, which have been fed a diet of meagre wage growth and above target inflation for much of the past four years. As inflation heads up again, those meagre wage rises will stretch even less far and consumption will struggle to get going for a little while yet. The particularly disappointing aspect of today\u2019s data is that the growth in the value of spending on the high street also slowed to a standstill as households presumably tried to boost their savings. The chances of a triple-drip had receded a little with improved data in recent weeks, but in truth the data had not pointed to much momentum. And this release brings a dip back on the table. If the snow disruption is reflected in other industries, with construction being the most likely candidate again, then we could well see a quarterly contraction in Q1 2013. Here's Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight on the dire UK retail sales figures. Even allowing for a substantial hit to retail sales from the snow, the further fall in January fuels concern that consumers may be becoming more careful in their spending as consumer price inflation moves back up and squeezes purchasing power. A serious concern for retailers - and the economy in general - is that consumers\u2019 purchasing power is coming under renewed pressure from a move back up in inflation while earnings growth remains muted. Briefly over to Ireland where there is some good news on the jobs front, with the announcement of 450 posts from eBay in the border town of Dundalk. Our correspondent in Dublin Henry McDonald reports: The Taoiseach Enda Kenny visited eBay's operation centre in Dundalk this morning at the launch of the new jobs. eBay has joined the likes of Facebook, Twitter, Linked-In and Google in establishing their European base in the Republic. The new posts will help provide the growing European customer base of the company\u2019s eBay Marketplaces and PayPal businesses with an enhanced experience in the areas of customer services, sales and compliance. The new positions, which are in addition to 1,000 new jobs announced by PayPal last year, are located within its Customer Services team and also based at the Dundalk facility. Gary Hagel, Senior Director, eBay Customer Experience, UK, Ireland and Rest of Europe said: \u201ceBay\u2019s continued commitment to its customers is underlined through this investment in customer services team members fulfilling a variety of roles to make eBay an even better place to shop and sell. Ireland is a centre of excellence for our Global Customer Experience function and the country provides a highly-skilled workforce for eBay with the required technical and language skills, an attractive research environment and proven track record on delivery.\u201d Louise Phelan, Vice President Global Operations EMEA at PayPal said: \u201cToday\u2019s announcement is fantastic news for the Dundalk area. We are looking forward to welcoming our eBay colleagues at the PayPal site in Dundalk. Last year was a great year for PayPal in Ireland. Our Dundalk site was operational within 11 weeks of the contracts being signed. We currently have over 230 people employed on site there and we look forward to continuing to expand this number in 2013.\u201d Just to recap, the UK economy shrank in the final three months of 2012. If it contracts again in the first three months of this year, that will plunge the UK into its third recession in four years... the dreaded triple-dip. That would leave chancellor George Osborne's reputation in tatters. And consumer spending is a huge part of the UK economy, as noted by Sky's Ed Conway. Here's James Knightley from ING on the impact of retail sales on the pound. The ONS stated that there was an impact from snow which had particularly hurt small grocers. This adds to the negative newsflow on the UK with worries over the UK\u2019s EU referendum and the Scottish independence vote along with a potential rating downgrade all helping to keep downward pressure on sterling. Rather than the snow, some analysts see a more fundamental issue at play in the UK retail sales figures. The news has sent the pound tumbling to its lowest point in more than six months against the dollar, at $1.5470. The main factor driving UK retail sales lower was a slump in food sales, with food sales down 1.6% in January, the largest monthly fall since May 2011. Even more starkly, food sales were estimated to have fallen 2.6% year-on-year (seasonally adjusted), to the lowest level since April 2004. The ONS says small grocers blamed poor sales on the heavy snowfall at the end of the month. As energy and futures trader Nicola Duke notes, the figures do seem to represent reality out on the streets. Ouch. UK retail sales slumped dramatically in January, down 0.6% on the month, compared with expectations of a 0.5% increase. That's terrible news for George Osborne as it will reignite fears that the UK is headed for a triple-dip recession. We've got UK retail sales figures for January coming up and the forecasts are pretty upbeat. Economists expect December's 0.3% decline to swing to a 0.5% rise in sales over the month. Although Marc Ostwald of Monument Securities warns that the data between December and February is often very wide of expectations. Eight minutes until we find out... Disabled citizens have gathered outside the main offices of the finance ministry in Athens this morning to protest against reductions to their salaries and pensions imposed as part of a broader government austerity program. Ekathimerini reports: The union representing the country's disabled is lobbying the government to provide relief to the retired and working disabled and for guardians of those with heavy disabilities. Unionists have demanded a meeting with Finance Minister Yannis Stournaras, Labor and Social Insurance Minister Yiannis Vroutsis and others to discuss their grievances. While Greek students celebrated Valentine's Day with a protest march last night, demonstrating against reforms to the education system. And in the country's second largest city, Thessaloniki, demonstrators gathered to protest against the death of 38-year-old Babakar Ndiaye from Senegal who died after falling from a height of 7m to the train station in Athens while being chased by the municipal police for selling goods in the street. Looking back at yesterday's figures, Draghi says fourth quarter GDP data was more negative than the ECB expected. Now it's ECB chief Mario Draghi's turn to speak out against currency manipulation. Over in Moscow for the G20, he says: Currency chatter is inappropriate, fruitless and self-defeating. He says the ECB mandate is mid-term price stability in both directions. The exchange rate is not a policy target but it is important for growth and price stability, he adds, noting the fundamental issue at the heart of these discussions. He too says the euro is not overvalued, saying that nominal and real euro exchange rates are around their long-term averages. He declines to comment on the likely wording of the G20 statement. He also weighs in on the austerity vs growth debate, saying: We don't believe that inflating budget deficits to create demand is sustainable. No pictures of Draghi in a wooly hat yet, but here's a reminder of another central bank governor enjoying the snow at the 2010 G7 meeting... As the meetings and photo shoots of the Group of 20 jamboree begin, there are those that question how useful these events are. Paul Donovan, senior economist at UBS, says: And so another taxpayer financed weekend minibreak gets underway, as twenty countries fly their officials around the world to have their photograph taken and to issue a pre-agreed communiqu\u00e9. At a guess the communiqu\u00e9 will say that the G20 likes growth and doesn't like recessions. Spanish inflation eased in January, according to data from the national statistics agency. CPI rose 2.7% in January, compared with the same month last year, down from 2.9% in December; while the EU-harmonised annual price inflation came in at 2.8%, compared with 3% in December. There's also some better news out of Portugal, despite the dire GDP figures out yesterday, which showed its economy shrinking by 1.8% in the fourth quarter of 2012. The FT reported last night: Portugal\u2019s debt agency is confident that the country is poised to regain full access to bond market funding in the next few months and exit its bailout programme, despite its heavy debts and recession-plagued economy. \u201cI expect we will have full market access in the next few months,\u201d Jo\u00e3o Moreira Rato, chief executive and chairman of IGCP, the Portuguese treasury and government debt agency, told the Financial Times. \u201cWe are very close to it,\u201d he added. \u201cIt looks like everything is moving in the right direction.\u201d As independent economist Shaun Richards notes, this demonstrates how far removed the financial markets are from reality. He noted the dire economic problems that have been inflicted on Portugal as a result of austerity in his blog yesterday. Ahead of the meeting, Germany's central bank governor Jens Weidmann spoke to Bloomberg. And, of course, the subject of currencies came up. Weidmann said the euro was not seriously overvalued, and that the ECB would not cut rates just to weaken the euro. He said ECB chief Mario Draghi was not trying to talk down the euro at the recent press conference. Sticking with the ECB, he said the central bank may be forced to show its hand on the outright monetary transactions bond-buying programme. He too sees a gradual recovery in the second half. On Ireland, he said the recent deal to switch a costly promissory note, used to pay for the rescue of failed Anglo Irish Bank, into less expensive sovereign bonds, could breach the ban on monetary state financing. Finally, he said rumours of his resignation were greatly exaggerated. Keen readers of the blog may remember Twitter erupted with news of Weidmann's imminent departure last month, only for the Bundesbank to deny it within minutes. Bloomberg is running both a full story and some key quotes from the interview. Earlier this week, the G7 issued a joint statement reaffirming its \"longstanding commitment to market determined exchange rates\". But this show of unity was quickly undermined by off-the-record briefings critical of Japan. It is thought that G20 hosts Russia would like to echo the thrust of the G7 text when they issue their communique on Saturday, but there will no doubt be substantial wrangling over the wording today and tomorrow. Russian finance minister Anton Siluanov said yesterday: The G-20 countries have always held the position that currency policy should be based on market conditions. Russia has already said that Japan will not be singled out in the text. Siluanov's deputy, Sergei Storchak \u2013 who is Russia's G20 representative or 'sherpa' as they are known \u2013 told reporters: There will be no specific mention of Japan - we are all in the same boat. Good morning and welcome back to our rolling coverage of the eurozone crisis and other global economic events. Today the finance ministers and bank governors of the Group of 20 nations will start their two day meeting in Moscow in an attempt to reach a common stance on currency manipulation. Japan will be under pressure for its expansive policies that have driven down the value of the yen.",

He says, while you can blame the snow for some things, the real reason behind poor sales is that consumers don't have the money to splash out. More online shortly...&#xa0;</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The best explanation of all, therefore, is the most obvious one: consumers are skint. Real incomes, according to the ONS, are back to 2003 levels, and with petrol prices again rising sharply there is simply less money available for discretionary spending.<br>But isn\u2019t this inconsistent with an improving labour market, which should be leading to an increase in aggregate incomes? Not at all. Rising employment masks two big trends: the increase in part-time work and the willingness of workers to accept cuts in real (inflation-adjusted) pay in order to avoid losing their jobs.<br>As a result, spending power for millions of Britons is weak and is likely to remain so. That\u2019s why the ONS is reporting that the proportion of on-line sales remained above the 10% mark in January. Normally, there is a spike in internet buying in December as consumers load up on CDs, books and clothes for Christmas presents, and then the percentage falls back. This year it has remained high, a sign that Britain has not lost the spending habit but is being forced to shop around for bargains.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-511e0f2e95cb419168cb3fbf\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-02-15T10:34:22.843Z\">10.34am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Brazil will not allow over-appreciation of real</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Brazil's finance minister Guido Mantega is now making his voice heard over in Moscow at the G20.

For example, the 0.6% decline in January compared with a 1.9% monthly fall in December 2010, when the country was also hit by heavy snow. The data therefore add to other survey evidence which suggests the economy got off fairly lightly from snow disruption, further allaying fears of a weather-related \"triple dip\" recession.

The underlying picture is that the economy is bouncing along the bottom, so weather disruptions can easily tip it into negative territory.</p> <p>The underlying story is a familiar one for UK households, which have been fed a diet of meagre wage growth and above target inflation for much of the past four years. As inflation heads up again, those meagre wage rises will stretch even less far and consumption will struggle to get going for a little while yet. The particularly disappointing aspect of today\u2019s data is that the growth in the value of spending on the high street also slowed to a standstill as households presumably tried to boost their savings.</p> <p>The chances of a triple-drip had receded a little with improved data in recent weeks, but in truth the data had not pointed to much momentum. And this release brings a dip back on the table.

      "standfirst": "Analysts say IAG could benefit from American deal, but clouds remain as Iberia staff prepare to strike", 
      "body": "<p>Investors in <strong>International Airlines Group,</strong> the owner of British Airways and Spain's Iberia, had a bumpy but rewarding ride last week.</p> <p>The company benefited from news that American Airlines and US Airways planned to merge, one of a number of recent deals which suggest the possible return of an acquisition spree.</p> <p>Analysts said IAG, as a partner with American, would get access to further routes if the merger succeeded, while consolidation could see a increase in fares and thus revenues for the airlines. Liberum analysts estimated the merger could add \u20ac70m to IAG's earnings.</p> <p>But there are clouds on the horizon for the airline, notably at Iberia. Its pilots are due to go on strike next week to protest against job cuts, while Spain's struggling Bankia has appointed advisors to sell some of its stakes in various companies. Following the merger of BA and Iberia, Bankia has a 12% shareholding in IAG, and the prospect of a sale could hang over the company's shares.</p> <p>IAG shares closed 1p higher at 227.9p, up just over 9p on the week.</p> <p>News that US investor Warren Buffett and Brazil's Jorge Paulo Lemann had teamed up to buy Heinz for $28bn added to the recent merger mania, following news of a buyout of Dell computers and Liberty Global's plan to take over Virgin Media.</p> <p><strong>Vodafone</strong> meanwhile could come into conflict with Liberty over a German cable television business. The UK mobile phone group, up 0.25p to 167.8p, was reported to be interested in a takeover of Kabel Deutschland, which could be worth up to \u00a37bn. But Liberty said on Thursday it expected consolidation in Germany's cable companies, while it had earlier indicated the bid for Virgin would not rule out further deals. Analysts at Espirito Santo said:</p> <blockquote> In light of these comments we remain of the view that Liberty Global would be likely to consider making a counter offer should Vodafone bid for Kabel Deutschland. </blockquote> <p>So, with all the corporate developments and despite some poor economic data, the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> finished the week at 6328.26p, a 0.90 point gain on the day but a 65 point rise since Monday.</p> <p>But signs of a deepening recession in the eurozone, with a 0.6% fall in GDP in the final quarter unveiled on Thursday, dented some of the optimism, while UK retail sales figures also made for gloomy reading.</p> <p>As the G20 met in Moscow for a two day summit, the weakening yen raised fears of central bankers stoking a currency war. Comments by the G7 during the week only served to make things more confusing.</p> <p>Mining shares turned in a mixed performance, with <strong>Anglo American</strong> adding 26p to \u00a320.39 as a 15% hike in its dividend helped make up for a 50% drop in underlying annual earnings. Outgoing chief executive Cynthia Carroll, who hands over at the end of next month to Mark Cutifani, also revealed impairment charges for its Minas Rio iron ore mine in Brazil and its troubled platinum business.</p> <p>Still with platinum, <strong>Johnson Matthey</strong> dipped 5p to \u00a322.94 as the refiner said it would lose commission income of around \u00a335m after Anglo American Platinum decided not to renew a development deal.</p> <p>Elsewhere in the mining sector, <strong>Fresnillo </strong>fell 105p to \u00a315.50 and <strong>Randgold Resources</strong> dropped 220p to \u00a355.80 after Citigroup issued sell recommendations on both shares due to declining gold and silver prices. The bank also cut its rating on <strong>Petropavlovsk</strong>, down 16.3p to 326.4p, from buy to neutral.</p> <p>In the market gold lost 2% to a six month low of $1609 an ounce, partly due to a lack of demand from China during the Lunar New Year holiday.</p> <p>But <strong>Arm </strong>added 15p to 940p after Citigroup lifted its price target for the UK chip specialist, whose designs are used in Apple's iPads, from 835p to 1070p.</p> <p>One merger which unravelled during the week was the tie-up between soft drinks groups <strong>Britvic</strong>, up 13.9p to 403.9p yesterday, and Irn Bru maker AG Barr, 10p better at 512.5p.

      "bodyText": "Investors in International Airlines Group, the owner of British Airways and Spain's Iberia, had a bumpy but rewarding ride last week. The company benefited from news that American Airlines and US Airways planned to merge, one of a number of recent deals which suggest the possible return of an acquisition spree. Analysts said IAG, as a partner with American, would get access to further routes if the merger succeeded, while consolidation could see a increase in fares and thus revenues for the airlines. Liberum analysts estimated the merger could add \u20ac70m to IAG's earnings. But there are clouds on the horizon for the airline, notably at Iberia. Its pilots are due to go on strike next week to protest against job cuts, while Spain's struggling Bankia has appointed advisors to sell some of its stakes in various companies. Following the merger of BA and Iberia, Bankia has a 12% shareholding in IAG, and the prospect of a sale could hang over the company's shares. IAG shares closed 1p higher at 227.9p, up just over 9p on the week. News that US investor Warren Buffett and Brazil's Jorge Paulo Lemann had teamed up to buy Heinz for $28bn added to the recent merger mania, following news of a buyout of Dell computers and Liberty Global's plan to take over Virgin Media. Vodafone meanwhile could come into conflict with Liberty over a German cable television business. The UK mobile phone group, up 0.25p to 167.8p, was reported to be interested in a takeover of Kabel Deutschland, which could be worth up to \u00a37bn. But Liberty said on Thursday it expected consolidation in Germany's cable companies, while it had earlier indicated the bid for Virgin would not rule out further deals. Analysts at Espirito Santo said: In light of these comments we remain of the view that Liberty Global would be likely to consider making a counter offer should Vodafone bid for Kabel Deutschland. So, with all the corporate developments and despite some poor economic data, the FTSE 100 finished the week at 6328.26p, a 0.90 point gain on the day but a 65 point rise since Monday. But signs of a deepening recession in the eurozone, with a 0.6% fall in GDP in the final quarter unveiled on Thursday, dented some of the optimism, while UK retail sales figures also made for gloomy reading. As the G20 met in Moscow for a two day summit, the weakening yen raised fears of central bankers stoking a currency war. Comments by the G7 during the week only served to make things more confusing. Mining shares turned in a mixed performance, with Anglo American adding 26p to \u00a320.39 as a 15% hike in its dividend helped make up for a 50% drop in underlying annual earnings. Outgoing chief executive Cynthia Carroll, who hands over at the end of next month to Mark Cutifani, also revealed impairment charges for its Minas Rio iron ore mine in Brazil and its troubled platinum business. Still with platinum, Johnson Matthey dipped 5p to \u00a322.94 as the refiner said it would lose commission income of around \u00a335m after Anglo American Platinum decided not to renew a development deal. Elsewhere in the mining sector, Fresnillo fell 105p to \u00a315.50 and Randgold Resources dropped 220p to \u00a355.80 after Citigroup issued sell recommendations on both shares due to declining gold and silver prices. The bank also cut its rating on Petropavlovsk, down 16.3p to 326.4p, from buy to neutral. In the market gold lost 2% to a six month low of $1609 an ounce, partly due to a lack of demand from China during the Lunar New Year holiday. But Arm added 15p to 940p after Citigroup lifted its price target for the UK chip specialist, whose designs are used in Apple's iPads, from 835p to 1070p. One merger which unravelled during the week was the tie-up between soft drinks groups Britvic, up 13.9p to 403.9p yesterday, and Irn Bru maker AG Barr, 10p better at 512.5p. The deal lapsed after it was referred to the Competition Commission, much to the surprise of City analysts. Damian McNeela at Panmure Gordon said: This decision seems bewildering given the relatively small share each of these brands has of the \u00a39bn Great Britain soft drinks market and the fact that Coca Cola and private label combined account for around 50% of the take home market. We believe that there remains a substantial appetite amongst both boards to complete this merger and we are of the opinion that should the terms of the merger be renegotiated Britvic are likely to be in a stronger position. Among the mid-caps, engineering group Invensys added 4.7p to 351.6p after Morgan Stanley moved from equal weight to overweight and raised its price target from 254p to 390p. Electrical retailer Darty blew a fuse, down 7.5% to 46p. The former owner of the - now bust - Comet chain issued a profit warning after weakness in its key markets in Europe. Activist investor Knight Vinke, which owns 25%, said it was unhappy with the company's progress and said it was taking a seat on the board. Vending machine group SnackTime dropped 40% to 6.5p as it said its trading performance was below market expectations and it was in talks with its banks about extending its current loan and revising covenants. It was also discussing the issued of \u00a3800,000 of loan notes to its larger shareholders.

      "body": "<h2>John Zhu, UK economist at HSBC</h2> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/feb/15/uk-retail-sales-drop-triple-dip-recession\" title=\"\">first piece of official data for 2013</a> indicates a bad start to the year. Snow may have played some role but only time will tell how much. More generally, the Christmas/January shopping period has disappointed and consumers are still struggling.</p> <p>While this is only January, inflation is not falling, nominal wage growth remains subdued, and the prospect of further disruptions due to the recent food scares in the UK mean retail sales may remain weak in Q1.</p> <h2>Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight</h2> <p>Even allowing for a substantial hit to retail sales from the snow, the further fall in January fuels concern that consumers may be becoming more careful in their spending as consumer price inflation moves back up and squeezes purchasing power.</p> <p>A serious concern for retailers - and the economy in general - is that consumers' purchasing power is coming under renewed pressure from a move back up in inflation while earnings growth remains muted. Consumer price inflation has moved back up to 2.7% from 2.2% in September and seems set to move above 3.0% over the coming months, while annual earnings growth has faltered to stand at just 1.3% in November.\"</p> <h2>Daniel Solomon, UK economist at the CEBR</h2> <p>Looking behind the headline figure, overall volume declines were driven by falls in fuel and food store retailing. Fuel sales fell by 8.0% over the year to January, the tenth consecutive month of annual declines. Food store sales volumes also fell by 2.6% over the same period, the fourth consecutive month of annual declines. The quantity sold in the food sector has now fallen to its lowest level since April 2004 in real terms, while declining sales volumes at household goods stores also dragged down the overall figure.</p> <p>Sales volumes increased at non-specialised retailers, such as department stores. Volumes here rose by 8.8% over the year to January and have now increased year on year for 12 consecutive months. Sales volumes at textile, clothing and footwear stores increased by 1.2% over the past year. Although clothing price inflation is positive, cheap labour in producer countries is keeping price rises in check, supporting sales volumes.</p> <p>Online retailing is becoming increasingly important because web-based traders can avoid the costly overheads associated with store-based operations and save customers the time and inconvenience of having to leave their homes to shop. Nevertheless, internet sales as a proportion of all retailing posted a surprise fall last month. In January, online sales constituted 10.1% of all retailing, down on the all-time high of 10.7% in November and December last year.</p> <p>We expect a fragile domestic economy to weigh down on retail sales growth throughout 2013. The economy is expected to grow by just 0.7% this year, having stagnated over 2012.

      "bodyText": "John Zhu, UK economist at HSBC The first piece of official data for 2013 indicates a bad start to the year. Snow may have played some role but only time will tell how much. More generally, the Christmas/January shopping period has disappointed and consumers are still struggling. While this is only January, inflation is not falling, nominal wage growth remains subdued, and the prospect of further disruptions due to the recent food scares in the UK mean retail sales may remain weak in Q1. Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight Even allowing for a substantial hit to retail sales from the snow, the further fall in January fuels concern that consumers may be becoming more careful in their spending as consumer price inflation moves back up and squeezes purchasing power. A serious concern for retailers - and the economy in general - is that consumers' purchasing power is coming under renewed pressure from a move back up in inflation while earnings growth remains muted. Consumer price inflation has moved back up to 2.7% from 2.2% in September and seems set to move above 3.0% over the coming months, while annual earnings growth has faltered to stand at just 1.3% in November.\" Daniel Solomon, UK economist at the CEBR Looking behind the headline figure, overall volume declines were driven by falls in fuel and food store retailing. Fuel sales fell by 8.0% over the year to January, the tenth consecutive month of annual declines. Food store sales volumes also fell by 2.6% over the same period, the fourth consecutive month of annual declines. The quantity sold in the food sector has now fallen to its lowest level since April 2004 in real terms, while declining sales volumes at household goods stores also dragged down the overall figure. Sales volumes increased at non-specialised retailers, such as department stores. Volumes here rose by 8.8% over the year to January and have now increased year on year for 12 consecutive months. Sales volumes at textile, clothing and footwear stores increased by 1.2% over the past year. Although clothing price inflation is positive, cheap labour in producer countries is keeping price rises in check, supporting sales volumes. Online retailing is becoming increasingly important because web-based traders can avoid the costly overheads associated with store-based operations and save customers the time and inconvenience of having to leave their homes to shop. Nevertheless, internet sales as a proportion of all retailing posted a surprise fall last month. In January, online sales constituted 10.1% of all retailing, down on the all-time high of 10.7% in November and December last year. We expect a fragile domestic economy to weigh down on retail sales growth throughout 2013. The economy is expected to grow by just 0.7% this year, having stagnated over 2012. Real wages are also forecast to decline, as tight job market conditions limit wage growth and inflation remains elevated. This will cut into consumers' spending power, signalling a bleak year ahead for retailers.

While Minas Rio still has risks, we believe the upside potential to the revised $8.8bn capex budget is minimal.
