      "bodyText": "The reliance of eurozone banks on the European Central Bank was demonstrated on Monday when Portugal revealed that its domestic banks were tapping the central bank for record amounts of funding. The Bank of Portugal said the use by domestic banks for the various facilities available from the ECB rose to \u20ac56.3bn in March \u2013 up from \u20ac47.5bn in February and greater than the previous record level of \u20ac49.1bn in August 2010. Bailed out by the EU and International Monetary Fund in April 2011 for \u20ac78bn, Portugal has \u20ac12bn earmarked for bolstering its banks' capital positions if necessary in the months ahead. The plight of Portugal's banks was revealed following the cash injection by the ECB in February when the central bank lent \u20ac529bn to 800 banks across the eurozone through its long-term refinancing operation (LTRO). Portuguese banks were among those frozen out from the wholesale funding markets \u2013 where banks borrow from each other or professional investors \u2013 during the height of the eurozone crisis and as a result are among a number in the eurozone that utilise ECB funding. \"I think it's natural and reasonable for banks to have taken advantage of these funds under the circumstances, especially after the ECB relaxed some collateral requirements before February's injection,\" Teresa Gil Pinheiro, chief economist at Banco BPI in Lisbon, told Reuters. \"The LTRO injection was in late February so it's natural that it is registered in March,\" she said. The Portuguese continued reliance on ECB funding comes amid fresh concerns in the eurozone about the price at which the governments of Spain and Italy can borrow on the markets. A weak auction of Spanish government bonds last week \u2013 when some \u20ac2.5bn rather than \u20ac3.5bn were sold \u2013 was regarded a sign that the initial confidence the ECB created through its injections of cheap cash was evaporating. \"Of immediate concern is the trend in Spanish and Italian government bond yields,\" said Gary Jenkins of Swordfish Research. \"The recent uplift in yields for both Spain and Italy are most concerning, because whilst in the short term the LTROs helped to save the system, they could accelerate the crisis if they do not work in lowering yields and encouraging investors to buy Italian and Spanish government bonds,\" Jenkins added. He is concerned that if yields keep rising, and the prices fall, the banks which have bought the government bonds will find themselves in a difficult position when they next disclose their holdings of government bonds. There is also criticism that the cheap funds being provided by the ECB are being sat on by banks and not being used to finance loans to companies or individuals. \"As banks across the euro area hoard cash, the long-term refinancing operations appear to be having a limited impact on the real economy, and we may see the ECB continue to carry out its easing cycle in 2012 as the region remains at risk for a prolonged recession,\" said David Song, currency analyst at DailyFX. Last week, data showed more than 17 million people in the eurozone were out of work in February, the highest level since 1997 \u2013 two years before the single currency was created in January 1999. New data on Monday showed that industrial production in Greece \u2013 the first eurozone country to receive a bailout \u2013 continued to fall in an economy already on track for its fifth consecutive year of recession. In February industrial production fell 8.3% on the year, after falling 6% in January and almost 12% in December.",

    "webTitle": "Gas prices will rise due to increased distribution costs, networks warn", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Gas network owners have raised the prospect of escalating energy costs beyond 2020 after predicting that distribution costs will rise by up to 27% by the beginning of the next decade. Network companies including National Grid have told the energy regulator that the cost of upgrading their facilities will rise by double-digit amounts between 2013 and 2021 \u2013 an increase that would ultimately be passed on to consumers if it is waved through. The estimates led one energy commentator to warn that the energy-related financial squeeze on UK households was coming from \"all sides\". Network owners claim that the cost increases will pay for the replacement of steel pipes with plastic tubing, and cover the cost of disruptive street works. In submissions to the Ofgem watchdog, Northern Gas Networks, which supplies energy to 2.6 million customers in northern England, said costs would increase by 27%. The largest distributor, National Grid, which covers 10m homes including in London, proposed cost increases of 11%, and the second largest, Scotia Gas Networks, which covers Scotland and the south-east, claimed costs would also rise by 11%. Wales and West Utilities put forward the second highest increase, at 22%. The GMB trade union, which represents around 30,000 energy industry workers, warned that thousands of jobs were at risk due to the increased use of subcontractors in the eight-year plans. \"We are in a perfect storm for consumers,\" the union said. \"In an industry that is less safe, with lower standards of service, it is the economics of the madhouse.\" The gas networks supply energy to a total of 20m homes in the UK. Mark Todd, director of the Energyhelpline.com price comparison site, said the submissions underlined the financial toll exacted on households by energy costs. Distribution costs account for around 20% of a household gas bill. According to Todd, the average daily gas bill has more than doubled since 2002, from 91p to \u00a32.06. \"There is pressure from all sides on people's energy bills,\" said Todd. \"It seems like there is no let up for the consumer. We have got raw material cost increases, green taxes to pay for insulation and wind farms. And now this, investment in infrastructure which everyone says is falling to pieces.\" According to a survey published last week by uSwitch, another comparison service, and the polling company YouGov, a third of households that are in arrears on their energy bills have slipped further into the red over the past year. Ofgem, which must approve the plans, has flagged up \"material issues\" over the proposals and has told the gas network owners that it had expected falling costs over the next eight years, not double-digit increases. The watchdog has set a deadline of 27 April for new cost estimates. An Ofgem spokesperson said: \"We are committed to ensuring value-for-money for energy consumers, and we have made it clear to companies our concerns over their proposed cost increases. We will publish our own proposals for the next gas distribution price control in July, and we will consult widely with stakeholders on these proposals prior to making a final decision later this year.\" Responding to the GMB's warnings on safety, a spokesperson for National Grid said: \"We plan to invest over \u00a310bn in our gas networks over the next 10 years so that consumers will continue to receive a safe and reliable gas supply. We are also seeking \u00a3100m to train apprentices to ensure our skilled workforce is maintained.\"",
