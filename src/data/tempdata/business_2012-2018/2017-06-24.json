      "bodyText": "The investment plans of Jaguar Land Rover are unlikely to be an isolated reaction to Brexit. Last week the carmaker revealed amid a fanfare of publicity that it would be hiring 5,000 extra engineers and, with less fanfare, that it would begin work on its next-generation electric car in Austria. Very simply, the company appears to have made a judgment that for the next two to three years the pound will remain low and, with this discount in place on its exports, it will profit from shifting a huge volume of diesel cars from factories in the West Midlands and Merseyside to the rest of the world. But the post-2020 years will be dominated by sales of electric cars, and for that Brexit poses too many risks. The rhetoric from the car industry has become more strident as the opening of negotiations has neared and last year\u2019s vague promises from business secretary Greg Clark of help and support have faded from memory. Mike Hawes, the boss of the carmakers\u2019 lobbying organisation, said last week that without the promise from Theresa May of interim arrangements to fall back on when talks on a deal conclude in 2019, firms would look overseas for expansion, not to the UK. Hawes has long argued for a deal that keeps tariffs low and regulations in harmony to favour trade. The difference between his comments in the past week and those just a few months ago was the tone. It was all high anxiety, where once there was dead calm. Already the anecdotal evidence of scrapped investments in the UK are piling up. City investment managers say their clients are increasingly twitchy about what David Davis, the UK\u2019s chief negotiator, can achieve against the brick wall of intransigence built by EU leaders. It doesn\u2019t matter to exporters that Nigel Farage says that a hard Brexit is for the birds, after the election and a hung parliament. A hard Brexit is still the logical outcome of the UK\u2019s position that free movement of labour and the jurisdiction of the European court of justice must end in Calais. The opening skirmishes over the right of EU citizens to remain in the UK and on what terms have shown how tough Angela Merkel and other EU leaders intend to be as they stand behind Michel Barnier and his team to preserve the integrity of the union, and the single market in particular. The former Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis gives a disturbing account of his negotiations in Brussels following the country\u2019s debt crisis. Greece was obviously in a worse position than the UK, and therefore a weaker negotiating partner. Still, his experience is relevant. He warns that EU negotiators will happily drown meetings in swaths of data and a determination to focus on details when the resolution of a particular problem is within their grasp. So it wasn\u2019t surprising that the Belgian prime minister and others described May\u2019s proposals as vague. It is almost the default position of any senior EU-supporting politician. Even dyed-in-the-wool europhiles can recognise that the EU\u2019s reaction to the 2008 crash and its aftermath showed that democracy plays second fiddle to the survival of the union. In his book Adults in the Room: My Battle with Europe\u2019s Deep Establishment, Varoufakis relates how the German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble welcomed him to his first meeting with the words: \u201cIt is my mandate against yours.\u201d Sch\u00e4uble, according to Varoufakis, \u201cwas honouring a long EU tradition of neglecting democratic mandates in the name of respecting them\u201d. Germany\u2019s tight-fisted finance chief, feted as one of the architects of German reunification, and reviled in equal measure as the chief enslaver of Greece in perpetuity, may be shuffled to one side in a new Merkel government after elections this year. But the EU will continue to sing the same song, especially now that May\u2019s mandate is that much weaker. And that is what British and international companies based in the UK are waking up to. They themselves spend billions of pounds each year lobbying in Brussels to gain an advantage against outside competition. If they didn\u2019t, Europe would be deluged with cheap goods from the far east while its huge trade surplus with the US would be much diminished. Estimates that the German car companies would lose 60,000 or 80,000 jobs in the event of a hard Brexit and the return of tariffs to Anglo-German trade might be close to the truth, but they miss the point. Business leaders from Warsaw to Stockholm, and Madrid to Dublin, are well aware that Brussels believes in Brussels first and foremost, and the advantages to them of this stance are many. Davis was always kidding himself as he toured Europe before the talks, telling local politicians that they were powerless to prevent Britain extracting a beneficial trade deal because they were in hock to big business. If Bavarian politicians were being dictated to, it was not by BMW, it was by the Brussels elite. Yes, Barnier et al were nervous last year when Italy\u2019s Five Star Movement and Spain\u2019s Podemos were poised to wreak Ukip-style havoc with their own exit plans. But that time has passed, leaving Brussels free to bury Davis in details \u2013 and any hopes of a soft Brexit with it.",

      "bodyText": "A decade ago, Frances O\u2019Grady thought she had seen just about the worst conditions possible for workers in 21st-century Britain. As part of a team investigating vulnerable employment, the trades union leader held clandestine meetings in churches with intimidated workers that exposed life at the sharp end of the jobs market. \u201cWe had stories about people working up to their knees in water in white meat factories on zero hours. Pretty shocking stuff,\u201d she recalls. Now on the 10th anniversary of that landmark commission into vulnerable employment, the general secretary of the TUC seems exasperated that for all the evidence of workers being mistreated, little has changed. And yet for the past fortnight her frustrations have been mixed with a glint of optimism. The election shock was a clear signal people have had enough, O\u2019Grady tells the Observer. \u201cTen years on we are forced to take stock, and what\u2019s happened? We\u2019ve gone backwards,\u201d O\u2019Grady says before a TUC conference on Monday to launch a campaign for better jobs and pay. \u201cMy feeling is that the government needs to get its act together pretty fast. I am not overly optimistic on this front. But if they learned anything from that election campaign, then they should have learned there is a real appetite for real change in the workplace.\u201d Sitting in her airy central London office, clasping an \u201cI love unions\u201d mug full of tea, the 57-year-old reels off a sorry list of statistics. \u201cThe number of people in precarious work has rocketed by over a quarter over the last five years. We\u2019ve got over three million people at the sharpest of the sharp end \u2026 This is people who are not only on low pay: they have also got no rights, and even if they had rights they would be too scared to enforce them,\u201d she says. The new campaign, called the Great Jobs Agenda, is targeting the millions of people in precarious work in the so-called gig economy \u2013 where, rather than having fixed permanent roles, workers tend to be given tasks as and when they are needed. That kind of work has grown hand in hand with the rise of online shopping, and platforms such as the taxi-hailing app Uber and the takeaway delivery service Deliveroo. Most of those companies say they hire independent contractors, who miss out on rights such as the minimum wage and sick pay. They are often paid per job rather than by the hour. Other workers in the gig economy, for example in care homes and pubs, are on zero-hours contracts with no guaranteed work and therefore no guaranteed income. They also tend to be on lower pay. O\u2019Grady also highlights the army of people getting work in warehouses through temporary employment agencies, such as with Sports Direct. An investigation by the Guardian highlighted a climate of fear at the retailer\u2019s Shirebrook warehouse in Derbyshire, prompting a select committee of MPs to say it was being run like a Victorian workhouse. O\u2019Grady reaches for a similar description. \u201cI am personally shocked about how technology is used as a tyrant in the workplace. Tracking people going to the toilet. Tracking the work they do \u2026 All of that feels Dickensian in its failure to respect workers as human beings. They are just commodities. There is something really sickening about it.\u201d Trade unions and journalists have exposed \u201cexactly what\u2019s going on in high street names like Sports Direct\u201d, she says, and now there is widespread anger. But Theresa May\u2019s promise of an economy that works for everyone seems to have made little difference so far. \u201cThere are people across the spectrum who are pretty outraged at what\u2019s going on in 21st-century Britain. But nothing\u2019s happened. We had the prime minister on the steps of Downing Street, we\u2019ve had promise after promise, and we\u2019ve had no action. So I think patience is wearing thin and I think it\u2019s important that politicians do listen \u2013 but more importantly that they act. And there is no reason for delay. How much more evidence do people need?\u201d The TUC wants zero-hours contracts banned and for everyone on regular hours to have a right to a written contract guaranteeing their normal working hours. It wants an end to bogus self-employment and believes the law should change to give people a default right to qualify for all employment rights, unless the employer can demonstrate they are genuinely self-employed. O\u2019Grady says people\u2019s anger goes further than the squeeze on living standards that has been sparked by meagre wage growth and a rise in living costs since the Brexit vote. She also points to the \u00a34bn a year the TUC reckons insecure work is costing the public coffers in lost tax and higher benefits. \u201cYes it is about falling real wages, yes it is about people\u2019s anxieties about what sorts of jobs their kids are going to go into \u2013 but there are these immediate, urgent issues of some employers running riot with exploitative contracts that are not just robbing those workers of a decent job and livelihood but robbing the exchequer too,\u201d she says. The TUC wants workers to go on to its new website, https://greatjobsquiz.org.uk, where they can rate their workplace by checking, among other things, if it pays the living wage, recognises trade unions and is safe. It is a kind of \u201cTripadvisor for bosses\u201d, says O\u2019Grady. The site will also tell workers what their rights are. O\u2019Grady, who has two grown-up children, feels that kind of information is urgently needed to prevent a culture of precarious work becoming entrenched. \u201cFor me, the heartbreaking bit is the generation of workers who don\u2019t know any better \u2013 who think that this is normal,\u201d she says. As for where unions fit into the world of rising self-employment and short-term contracts, O\u2019Grady insists that collective action will remain the best route to change. She also rebuts the idea that falling trade union membership leaves them without a mandate, but she wants better access to workplaces. \u201cSurely it should be possible for workers to have the right to be represented by a union and also to have a right for unions to bargain on their behalf. Because in the end, particularly with vulnerable workers, banding together is your only chance of resetting that power and balance,\u201d she says. The prime minister made a nod to changing culture in workplaces last year when she appointed Matthew Taylor, the former head of Tony Blair\u2019s policy unit, to head a review into modern employment. He is due to report soon. So is O\u2019Grady hopeful the review will mark a turning point? \u201cMatthew\u2019s job is to make recommendations to government,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t think governments of any colour can duck their responsibility or outsource their responsibility or use reports to delay. They should be getting on with the job.\u201d There is a worry, however, that getting on will prove more difficult as Brexit negotiations finally get under way \u2013 a year on from a referendum in which O\u2019Grady made the case for staying in the EU to protect workers\u2019 rights. \u201cI am very conscious about civil servants being dragooned into Brexit work and what does that mean for everything else? There is still a country to run. There are still injustices to tackle.\u201d Yet she remains optimistic that May\u2019s weakened government knows it cannot let workers\u2019 rights fall by the wayside. \u201cThe government would pay a big political price for not acting to tackle insecurity at work. I can\u2019t think of too many elections where work issues were so high on the agenda,\u201d she says. Case studies Liz Lee Care home worker Lee has been on zero-hours contracts with care homes for four years and wants to keep things that way until her teenage children are older. The 48-year-old mother of two says she prefers not having to commit to fixed hours. \u201cIt fits my lifestyle, really. It slots in nicely,\u201d she says. Lee is on a zero-hours contract with a care home in Warwickshire and also on a \u201cbank\u201d list, where different homes can call on her to cover shifts when they are short of staff. She likes having the option of topping up her family\u2019s income but also being able to say no when she needs to be with her children, Shannon, 15, and Ciaran, 13. Her husband, Carl, runs his own business fitting professional kitchens in top-end restaurants around the country and is often away from home. Flexible working allows her to support the children\u2019s activities, such as dance, music and karate, says Lee. \u201cThere\u2019s also school holidays where there is nobody else to have the children \u2013 otherwise I would have to be paying out what I earn in childcare costs.\u201d As a carer Lee earns around \u00a39 per hour in the daytime, \u00a39.50 per hour at night and a little more at weekends. \u201cLuckily, in Carl\u2019s job he can support us anyway but it\u2019s nice to have that little extra for things like dance and singing lessons for my daughter, and to help pay for holidays.\u201d Some carers have said they are nervous about turning down work for fear of not getting further offers in the future. But Lee says she has never found that a problem. \u201cI\u2019ve always managed to get some form of work, and they still offer shifts to me,\u201d she says. \u201cThe only downside is that if I am off sick you don\u2019t get sick pay, but Carl can still support me.\u201d Syed Khalil Taxi driver Khalil, who lives in Dagenham, east London, has worked as a driver for Addison Lee and Uber over the past eight years, and experienced the downside of life in the gig economy. When he first joined Uber, the fast-growing ride hailing app, Khalil said he had high hopes, given promises of decent pay and the ability to work whatever hours he chose. He bought a car on hire purchase and initially paid no commission on rides secured via the app. But when he had a problem with his car and then got sick, Khalil says his situation changed. As a self-employed contractor he did not receive sick pay and, because he was the owner of the car, he continued to have to make hire purchase and insurance payments. He had to claim benefits. Before long, he had to go back to work in order to cover his rising bills. With his vehicle off the road, Khalil went to work for Addison Lee, where he could rent one of the taxi firm\u2019s own cars. But he says he had to work long hours to cover the cost of renting the car. He remained self-employed, so when he got ill again, with a kidney problem, he did not receive sick pay and had to continue to make rental payments. He says Addison Lee required him to wear a smart shirt and trousers, and he could be fined if spotted not meeting the dress code, so he felt like an employee without any of the benefits. He has now returned to Uber, as his own car is back on the road. But he says Uber has gradually raised the commission it takes and signed up more drivers so that his earnings have dropped. He says it regularly introduces new terms and conditions, with drivers having to agree to them before they can access the app. \u201cIf you say no, you can\u2019t log in. I\u2019ve been working as a minicab driver since 2009 \u2013 I\u2019m nearly 40 and I have no pension and no savings at all,\u201d he says. \u201cThere is no way you can plan anything, for a holiday or for the future.\u201d Uber\u2019s Tom Elvidge said: \u201cLicensed drivers who use our app are totally free to choose if, when and where they drive with no shifts or minimum hours. The vast majority of drivers tell us the reason why they signed up to Uber is so they can control their hours and be their own boss. We\u2019re always acting on feedback from drivers, which is why we\u2019re investing in discounted illness cover and savings schemes alongside other improvements.\u201d",

We\u2019ve gone backwards,\u201d O\u2019Grady says before a TUC conference on Monday to launch a campaign for better jobs and pay.</p> <p>\u201cMy feeling is that the government needs to get its act together pretty fast. I am not overly optimistic on this front. But if they learned anything from that election campaign, then they should have learned there is a real appetite for real change in the workplace.\u201d</p> <p>Sitting in her airy central London office, clasping an \u201cI love unions\u201d mug full of tea, the 57-year-old reels off a sorry list of statistics. \u201cThe number of people in precarious work has rocketed by over a quarter over the last five years. We\u2019ve got over three million people at the sharpest of the sharp end \u2026 This is people who are not only on low pay: they have also got no rights, and even if they had rights they would be too scared to enforce them,\u201d she says.</p> <p>The new campaign, called the Great Jobs Agenda, is targeting the millions of people in precarious work in the so-called gig economy \u2013 where, rather than having fixed permanent roles, workers tend to be given tasks as and when they are needed. That kind of work has grown hand in hand with the rise of online shopping, and platforms such as the taxi-hailing app Uber and the takeaway delivery service Deliveroo.</p> <p>Most of those companies say they hire independent contractors, who miss out on rights such as the minimum wage and sick pay. They are often paid per job rather than by the hour. Other workers in the gig economy, for example in care homes and pubs, are on zero-hours contracts with no guaranteed work and therefore no guaranteed income. They also tend to be on lower pay.</p> <p>O\u2019Grady also highlights the army of people getting work in warehouses through temporary employment agencies, such as with Sports Direct. An investigation by the <em>Guardian</em> highlighted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/09/how-sports-direct-effectively-pays-below-minimum-wage-pay\">a climate of fear</a> at the retailer\u2019s Shirebrook warehouse in Derbyshire, prompting a select committee of MPs to say it was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/22/mike-ashley-running-sports-direct-like-victorian-workhouse\">being run like a Victorian workhouse</a>.</p> <p>O\u2019Grady reaches for a similar description. \u201cI am personally shocked about how technology is used as a tyrant in the workplace. Tracking people going to the toilet. Tracking the work they do \u2026 All of that feels Dickensian in its failure to respect workers as human beings. They are just commodities. There is something really sickening about it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"abb47e060d405ab09aac509d56110a0c5db03bbd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/abb47e060d405ab09aac509d56110a0c5db03bbd/0_267_4000_2399/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Deliveroo rider on the road in London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Deliveroo rider on the road in London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bloomberg via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Trade unions and journalists have exposed \u201cexactly what\u2019s going on in high street names like Sports Direct\u201d, she says, and now there is widespread anger. But Theresa May\u2019s promise of an economy that works for everyone seems to have made little difference so far.</p> <p>\u201cThere are people across the spectrum who are pretty outraged at what\u2019s going on in 21st-century Britain. But nothing\u2019s happened. We had the prime minister on the steps of Downing Street, we\u2019ve had promise after promise, and we\u2019ve had no action. So I think patience is wearing thin and I think it\u2019s important that politicians do listen \u2013 but more importantly that they act. And there is no reason for delay. How much more evidence do people need?\u201d</p> <p>The TUC wants zero-hours contracts banned and for everyone on regular hours to have a right to a written contract guaranteeing their normal working hours. It wants an end to bogus self-employment and believes the law should change to give people a default right to qualify for all employment rights, unless the employer can demonstrate they are genuinely self-employed.</p> <p>O\u2019Grady says people\u2019s anger goes further than the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jun/22/brexit-economy-uk-slowdown-living-standards-costs\">squeeze on living standards</a> that has been sparked by meagre wage growth and a rise in living costs since the Brexit vote. She also points to the \u00a34bn a year the TUC reckons insecure work is costing the public coffers in lost tax and higher benefits.</p> <p>\u201cYes it is about falling real wages, yes it is about people\u2019s anxieties about what sorts of jobs their kids are going to go into \u2013 but there are these immediate, urgent issues of some employers running riot with exploitative contracts that are not just robbing those workers of a decent job and livelihood but robbing the exchequer too,\u201d she says.</p> <p>The TUC wants workers to go on to its new website, <a href=\"http://greatjobsquiz.org.uk\">https://greatjobsquiz.org.uk</a>, where they can rate their workplace by checking, among other things, if it pays the living wage, recognises trade unions and is safe. It is a kind of \u201cTripadvisor for bosses\u201d, says O\u2019Grady.</p> <p>The site will also tell workers what their rights are. O\u2019Grady, who has two grown-up children, feels that kind of information is urgently needed to prevent a culture of precarious work becoming entrenched.</p> <p>\u201cFor me, the heartbreaking bit is the generation of workers who don\u2019t know any better \u2013 who think that this is normal,\u201d she says.</p> <p>As for where unions fit into the world of rising self-employment and short-term contracts, O\u2019Grady insists that collective action will remain the best route to change. She also rebuts the idea that falling trade union membership leaves them without a mandate, but she wants better access to workplaces.</p> <p>\u201cSurely it should be possible for workers to have the right to be represented by a union and also to have a right for unions to bargain on their behalf. Because in the end, particularly with vulnerable workers, banding together is your only chance of resetting that power and balance,\u201d she says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"23dce8daca5a35b26c7bd16391aa691b73dd8dd4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/23dce8daca5a35b26c7bd16391aa691b73dd8dd4/0_36_6144_3686/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Uber\u2019s driver service centre in London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Uber\u2019s driver service centre in London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felix Clay for the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The prime minister made a nod to changing culture in workplaces last year when she appointed Matthew Taylor, the former head of Tony Blair\u2019s policy unit, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/oct/01/theresa-may-hires-former-tony-blair-policy-boss-to-review-workers-rights\">to head a review into modern employment</a>. He is due to report soon. So is O\u2019Grady hopeful the review will mark a turning point?</p> <p>\u201cMatthew\u2019s job is to make recommendations to government,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think governments of any colour can duck their responsibility or outsource their responsibility or use reports to delay. They should be getting on with the job.\u201d</p> <p>There is a worry, however, that getting on will prove more difficult as Brexit negotiations finally get under way \u2013 a year on from a referendum in which O\u2019Grady made the case for staying in the EU to protect workers\u2019 rights.</p> <p>\u201cI am very conscious about civil servants being dragooned into Brexit work and what does that mean for everything else? There is still a country to run. There are still injustices to tackle.\u201d</p> <p>Yet she remains optimistic that May\u2019s weakened government knows it cannot let workers\u2019 rights fall by the wayside.</p> <p>\u201cThe government would pay a big political price for not acting to tackle insecurity at work. I can\u2019t think of too many elections where work issues were so high on the agenda,\u201d she says.</p> <h2>Case studies</h2> <p><strong>Liz Lee</strong><br><strong>Care home worker</strong><br>Lee has been on zero-hours contracts with care homes for four years and wants to keep things that way until her teenage children are older. The 48-year-old mother of two says she prefers not having to commit to fixed hours. \u201cIt fits my lifestyle, really. It slots in nicely,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Lee is on a zero-hours contract with a care home in Warwickshire and also on a \u201cbank\u201d list, where different homes can call on her to cover shifts when they are short of staff. She likes having the option of topping up her family\u2019s income but also being able to say no when she needs to be with her children, Shannon, 15, and Ciaran, 13.</p> <p>Her husband, Carl, runs his own business fitting professional kitchens in top-end restaurants around the country and is often away from home. Flexible working allows her to support the children\u2019s activities, such as dance, music and karate, says Lee. \u201cThere\u2019s also school holidays where there is nobody else to have the children \u2013 otherwise I would have to be paying out what I earn in childcare costs.\u201d</p> <p>As a carer Lee earns around \u00a39 per hour in the daytime, \u00a39.50 per hour at night and a little more at weekends. \u201cLuckily, in Carl\u2019s job he can support us anyway but it\u2019s nice to have that little extra for things like dance and singing lessons for my daughter, and to help pay for holidays.\u201d</p> <p>Some carers have said they are nervous about turning down work for fear of not getting further offers in the future. But Lee says she has never found that a problem. \u201cI\u2019ve always managed to get some form of work, and they still offer shifts to me,\u201d she says. \u201cThe only downside is that if I am off sick you don\u2019t get sick pay, but Carl can still support me.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"42aa9b3b90e9291bceb0e29e3d87bfc251def6bf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/42aa9b3b90e9291bceb0e29e3d87bfc251def6bf/0_121_2576_1546/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Syed Khalil\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Syed Khalil: \u2018I have no pensions and no savings at all.\u2019</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Syed Khalil</strong><br><strong>Taxi driver</strong><br>Khalil, who lives in Dagenham, east London, has worked as a driver for Addison Lee and Uber over the past eight years, and experienced the downside of life in the gig economy.</p> <p>When he first joined Uber, the fast-growing ride hailing app, Khalil said he had high hopes, given promises of decent pay and the ability to work whatever hours he chose. He bought a car on hire purchase and initially paid no commission on rides secured via the app.</p> <p>But when he had a problem with his car and then got sick, Khalil says his situation changed. As a self-employed contractor he did not receive sick pay and, because he was the owner of the car, he continued to have to make hire purchase and insurance payments. He had to claim benefits.</p> <p>Before long, he had to go back to work in order to cover his rising bills. With his vehicle off the road, Khalil went to work for Addison Lee, where he could rent one of the taxi firm\u2019s own cars.</p> <p>But he says he had to work long hours to cover the cost of renting the car. He remained self-employed, so when he got ill again, with a kidney problem, he did not receive sick pay and had to continue to make rental payments. He says Addison Lee required him to wear a smart shirt and trousers, and he could be fined if spotted not meeting the dress code, so he felt like an employee without any of the benefits.</p> <p>He has now returned to Uber, as his own car is back on the road. But he says Uber has gradually raised the commission it takes and signed up more drivers so that his earnings have dropped. He says it regularly introduces new terms and conditions, with drivers having to agree to them before they can access the app.</p> <p>\u201cIf you say no, you can\u2019t log in. I\u2019ve been working as a minicab driver since 2009 \u2013 I\u2019m nearly 40 and I have no pension and no savings at all,\u201d he says. \u201cThere is no way you can plan anything, for a holiday or for the future.\u201d</p> <p>Uber\u2019s Tom Elvidge said: \u201cLicensed drivers who use our app are totally free to choose if, when and where they drive with no shifts or minimum hours. The vast majority of drivers tell us the reason why they signed up to Uber is so they can control their hours and be their own boss. We\u2019re always acting on feedback from drivers, which is why we\u2019re investing in discounted illness cover and savings schemes alongside other improvements.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "After Amazon\u2019s $14bn acquisition of Whole Foods, the stage is set for an epic clash between the online behemoth and the traditional retail king of America, Walmart. On one side, a business with an advanced online operation but little physical presence. On the other, a retailer with a huge physical presence but an underdeveloped digital side. Their battlefield of choice? The $800bn US retail food market. After the deal was announced, Amazon\u2019s role in gutting bricks-and-mortar retail caused stock in rival grocery businesses including Kroger, Costco and Supervalu to fall by as much as 17%. Such losses were mirrored by larger retailers, including Walmart, whose stock fell as much as 7%. The deal also raised questions about Amazon\u2019s accumulation of power. But the US commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, rejected anti-trust considerations, telling Fox Business Network he had not seen \u201canything that Amazon has done that would qualify remotely for anti-trust consideration\u201d. The size of a company was not in itself a problem, Ross said. \u201cTake their acquisition of Whole Foods. I think that\u2019s a very clever move to marry together a very good, high-quality, niche retailer with the very broad brush approach of marketing everything that Amazon has done so well. But I surely don\u2019t see any anti-trust implications in that.\u201d The success of Amazon\u2019s entry into the grocery business is not assured. Delivering fresh food is hardly the same as delivering books and clothing \u2013 \u201clast mile\u201d delivery of perishable goods to customers is notoriously problematic. Whole Foods\u2019 460 stores, however, give Amazon a high-end distribution chain, including a delivery service and the ability for Amazon to expand into markets to which it previously had no access. Whole Foods gets Amazon\u2019s massive cache of consumer data and technology. Analysts say that while the hook-up could affect other grocery chains, including the upscale Kroger, it\u2019s unlikely to affect Walmart, at least in the short term. The Bentonville, Arkansas-based company is the largest seller of food in the US, generating more than half its $486bn annual revenue from groceries. With 4,700 stores, Walmart has enjoyed a rare advantage, even as it struggles to compete with Amazon online. Last week, as the Amazon-Whole Foods deal was announced, Walmart fired back with its $310m acquisition of Bonobos, an innovative clothing retailer. That was the the company\u2019s fourth e-commerce acquisition since it paid $3.3bn for the e-commerce site Jet.com last year and placed founder Marc Lore in charge of its e-commerce operations. Analysts point out that Whole Foods\u2019 and Walmart\u2019s grocery business are not natural competitors. Whole Foods stores are concentrated in wealthier, higher-density markets. Walmart is focused on lower-income, lower-density areas. Nor, says Michael Pachter of Wedbush Securities, do their customer bases overlap. According to data from Kantar Retail, only around 9% of households who shopped at Whole Foods in April also shopped at a Walmart. \u201cWalmart customers were late adopters of Amazon Fresh (Amazon\u2019s grocery delivery service) and Amazon Prime,\u201d Pachter says, \u201cso they\u2019re going to be late adopters of the Whole Foods premium experience.\u201d Over time Walmart is likely to expand its grocery business, just as Amazon plans to do. Groceries ensure customers return frequently and not only when they need a new appliance, and can therefore be run as a zero-margin business \u2013 a terrifying notion to grocery rivals. As Pachter points out, no other sector in the economy besides rent or mortgage payments accounts for monthly outgoings so significant or consistent. Groceries, he says, matters \u201cbecause it is huge\u201d. \u201cWalmart wants to sell everything and Amazon is called the everything store. Groceries are a significant driver of other purchases. So the trick with Amazon may be to get trucks equipped so they can deliver groceries and TV sets. You have to assume that ultimately the biggest grocers and retailers are going to suffer equally.\u201d Amazon, with 50 million Prime customers in the US, may also be looking to adapt its grocery services to include a lower price point. The company recently cut fees for its Prime membership program to people on government food programs \u2013 nearly 20% of the US population, a move suggesting that the retailer plans to expand its services to lower-income consumers. That should also send a message to Walmart, which generates around $13bn annually in sales revenue from customers receiving food assistance. Last week, at a Whole Foods store in downtown Manhattan, many customers said the company\u2019s reputation for inflated prices was overblown and its products unfairly associated with consumer indulgence frivolity. Exiting with two bags of groceries, Lisa Miller said: \u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t know why it was so criticized. It has great policy, the food is amazing. Maybe it\u2019s a dollar more than the grocery store but I\u2019d rather pay for the quality.\u201d Amazon\u2019s expansion into food sales and distribution comes as it scales up its distribution infrastructure. Earlier this year it announced a $1.49bn worldwide air services hub at Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky international airport and the leasing of 20 Boeing 767 air cargo planes. In order to compete with Walmart, however, Amazon-owned Whole Foods may have to lower prices and force existing stores to conform, a move that appears antithetical to the culture of the John Mackey-led chain, where individual stores were given a degree of autonomy. The Amazon takeover may also come just in time. Over the past year, Whole Foods had begun closing underperforming stores and reducing its expansion program. Hostile actions by the equity fund Jana Partners forced several changes in the boardroom. In Manhattan, Whole Foods customers said they welcomed the deal. \u201cAmazon is moving into food, so Amazon and Walmart are going to be head to head,\u201d said Shayne McQuade, by trade a designer of solar backpacks. \u201cIt might be the beginning of a new era.\u201d",

You have to assume that ultimately the biggest grocers and retailers are going to suffer equally.\u201d</p> <p>Amazon, with 50 million Prime customers in the US, may also be looking to adapt its grocery services to include a lower price point. </p> <p>The company recently cut fees for its Prime membership program to people on government food programs \u2013 nearly 20% of the US population, a move suggesting that the retailer plans to expand its services to lower-income consumers. That should also send a message to Walmart, which generates around <a href=\"https://www.finsum.com/index.php/markets/corporate-news/item/5597-amazon-battles-walmart-for-low-end-of-market\">$13bn annually</a> in sales revenue from customers receiving food assistance.</p> <p>Last week, at a Whole Foods store in downtown Manhattan, many customers said the company\u2019s reputation for inflated prices was overblown and its products unfairly associated with consumer indulgence frivolity.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jun/20/amazon-whole-foods-silicon-valley-global-domination\">It's not just Amazon coming for Whole Foods \u2013 Silicon Valley is eating the world</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Exiting with two bags of groceries, Lisa Miller said: \u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t know why it was so criticized. It has great policy, the food is amazing. Maybe it\u2019s a dollar more than the grocery store but I\u2019d rather pay for the quality.\u201d<br></p> <p>Amazon\u2019s expansion into food sales and distribution comes as it scales up its distribution infrastructure. Earlier this year it <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-38839063\">announced</a> a $1.49bn worldwide air services hub at Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky international airport and the leasing of 20 Boeing 767 air cargo planes.</p> <p>In order to compete with Walmart, however, Amazon-owned Whole Foods may have to lower prices and force existing stores to conform, a move that appears antithetical to the culture of the <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/16/whole-foods-ceo-john-mackey-earned-8-million-from-the-amazon-deal.html\">John Mackey</a>-led chain, where individual stores were given a degree of autonomy. </p> <p>The Amazon takeover may also come just in time. Over the past year, Whole Foods had begun closing underperforming stores and reducing its expansion program. Hostile actions by the equity fund Jana Partners forced several changes in the boardroom. </p> <p>In Manhattan, Whole Foods customers said they welcomed the deal. </p> <p>\u201cAmazon is moving into food, so Amazon and Walmart are going to be head to head,\u201d said Shayne McQuade, by trade a designer of solar backpacks. \u201cIt might be the beginning of a new era.\u201d</p>",
