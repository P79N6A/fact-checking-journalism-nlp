      "bodyText": "The markets have closed early today and so are we, so here is quick closing summary. The FTSE 100 finished the day up 0.23%, capping a run of five days on rising share prices. Spain's IBEX gained 0.6% and France's CAC reversed its losses to finish up 0.07%. Other major European markets were closed. UK productivity declined in November, which is likely to add to concerns about relatively low output per worker compared to other developed economies. The government's controversial mortgage subsidy scheme Help to Buy helped push up mortgage approvals by almost 40% in a year, but lending to businesses has not recovered. France's economy shrank in the third quarter of this year, but officials forecasts are expected to show a return to growth in the final quarter of the year. Thank you for following and for all your comments today. Have a very merry Christmas! In the end it was more a small glass of sherry than turkey with the trimmings. But a modest Santa rally has lifted the FTSE 0.23% to 6,693 points. Spain's IBEX is up a healthy 0.6%, but no such cheer for France's CAC 40 index, which is down 0.08%, after those dismal GDP figures released earlier today. Kash Kamal, research analyst at Sucden Financial said European markets were being helped by better-than-expected data from the US. \"Stronger than expected Q3 GDP growth in the US and UK and stable growth in the eurozone... have encouraged investors who were previously on the sidelines to return to equity markets as annual gains across major global indices push to their highest levels since 2009. Quote via Reuters Here is our story on those rocketing mortgage figures: Mortgage approvals a third higher in November than last year Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS, says the data does little to fire optimism that banks are becoming more prepared to lend. It also raises questions as to whether the extension to the Funding for Lending Scheme (FLS) in April to favour lending to smaller and medium-sized businesses has had much impact. With the UK sustaining a decent level of economic activity and prospects looking relatively bright, it seems highly likely that business demand for credit will pick up appreciably over the coming months. As demand for credit does pick up, it is vitally important for healthy and more balanced UK growth that all companies who are in decent shape and who do want to borrow \u2013 whether it be to support their operations, lift investment, explore new markets \u2013 can do so, and at a non-punishing interest rate. This applies to all companies, whatever their size. So let's touch base with Reuters Breaking Views, who have been on a deep dive into the latest trends in business jargon. Analysis of 15 years of corporate press releases, and a decade or so of conference calls, shows some expressions are relentless in taking share. \"Visionary\" and \"disruptive\" have consistently surprised to the upside... If you are looking to express in terms of linguistics, there is a rich opportunity set to target. But be careful with what looks like low-hanging fruit. These phrases, net-net, may transitioned beyond an inflection point There is a worrying amount of thought leadership out there... Last minute gift idea? Spotted by Nick Malkoutzis at Kathimerini. Err, so who wants to play European Financial Stability Facility advisers? There is not much festive joy for President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande in France's latest GDP data: figures released by the Insee statistics agency show that the French economy shrank 0.1% in the third quarter, a notable reversal after the economy grew 0.6% in Q2. More details from the release: Household consumption slowed down, to +0.1% in Q3 compared to +0.4% Q2. Exports fell, (\u20131.3% Q3, compared to +1.9% Q2) while imports grew, albeit at a slower pace (+0.9% Q3, +1.5% Q2). Growth in household wages slowed down (+0.3% Q3, +0.5% Q2), while households' disposable incomes also slipped back (+0.1%Q3 after +0.4%Q2). Taxes on income and wealth grew as a share of GDP (+1.9% Q3, after +1.4%Q2), following \"budget consolidation measures\" - the de-indexation of income tax thresholds and the creation of a 45% bracket. However, Insee are forecasting growth for Q4, so France may yet avoid a double-dip recession... More UK data, but this time more gloom than boom. UK labour productivity fell 0.3% in the third quarter of the year, although output per worker rose slightly, according to the Office for National Statistics. Other highlights from the ONS release: Output per hour fell by by 0.6% in the manufacturing sector in the third quarter but declined by 1.2% in the broader production sector. Output per hour in the service sector was unchanged in Q3. Whole economy unit labour costs decreased by 0.8% in 2013 Q3, reflecting the impact of the high level of bonus payments that were included in the previous quarter, and were 1.3% higher than a year earlier. Manufacturing unit wage costs decreased by 0.3% in Q3 and were 0.7% higher than a year earlier. These figures will all be more grist to the mill for economists perplexed by the UK's \"productivity puzzle\" - strong growth in employment combined with lacklustre growth over the past year. UK workers also produce less than their peers in other developed countries, opening up a productivity gap. Back to the UK, where UK mortgage approvals have reached a four-year high, according to the British Bankers' Association. The most eye-catching statistic is the jump in gross mortgage borrowing to \u00a310.3bn in November, 37% higher than the previous year. The BBA credits \"assistance schemes for mortgages ... helping first-time buyers and housing chains generally\" i.e. the government's massive mortgage subsidy scheme Help to Buy . Unsecured borrowing increased by 0.9% over the year, reflecting growth in card borrowing (5.6%) but a fall in borrowing on personal loans and overdrafts (3.2%). David Dooks, BBA statistics director, said: More new mortgages and a net rise in borrowing reflected a stronger mortgage market in November. With approvals up a third on a year earlier, lending will continue to be strong in the months ahead. Annual growth in borrowing by manufacturing companies has turned positive for the first time in four years, although overall borrowing by companies is generally still subdued. The last point is interesting: the BBA figures show that lending to companies continues to decline, despite various schemes, such as Funding for Lending. Enrico Letta, Italy's prime minister, said his country was experiencing \"social fatigue\" , but promised further reforms in the new year. Speaking at his year-end press conference, he promised to present a formal coalition pact in January. Letta said: I have been part of this change and I feel the full weight of responsibility. This generation will have the opportunity of changing Italy and I am convinced it can do it. We have the most complex part of this crisis behind us and we have to be in a position to take advantage of some important opportunities. More from Reuters in Rome: Letta was speaking shortly before the Senate completed parliamentary approval for the 2014 budget after it cleared the lower house on Friday. He said a new pact for his coalition government to be worked out in detail in January would address issues ranging from cutting taxes that deter companies from hiring to easing citizenship laws for the children of immigrants. An overhaul of both the current electoral law and a parliamentary system that makes it difficult for any party to win a stable governing majority would come before European parliamentary elections in May, he said. One of the most interesting business stories this morning throws more light on investigations into possible manipulation of currency markets. The BBC reports that banks knew of unusual currency trading four years before regulators began investigating the \"London fix\". According to their report, the banks had warned their clients against trading at 4pm, after noticing sharp movements in exchange rates. Up to 15 banks have been drawn into the investigation into the possible manipulation of $3trillion a day currency markets, including HSBC and Barclays, although none have been formally accused of wrongdoing. From the BBC\u2019s report ... research by Morgan Stanley and seen by the BBC shows that banks were already concerned about the London fix in 2009 - four years before the investigations were announced. It noted unusually sharp movements in exchange rates around 4pm, concluding that anyone trading at that time is unlikely to get the best possible deal available that day, increasing the costs of currency trades. It calls this a \"surprising revelation,\" since the \"prevailing consensus\" is that the 4pm London fix is the \"optimal\" time to trade. Though small, these added costs can mount up significantly over a year's trading. \"In the worst case scenarios, these costs can even begin to have a debilitating effect on annual performance,\" says the report, entitled 'A Guide to FX Transaction Cost Analysis, Part 1'. David Ruffley, a member of the treasury select committee, has written to the Serious Fraud Office, asking for an investigation parallel to the Financial Conduct Authority's probe. I think it's fairly clear that everyone in this country who has shares in pension funds, and that's most of us one way or the other, will have seen a fall in the value of those shares as a result of this. And that's not a politician saying it - it is what a bank was telling its own customers in 2009. More gloom for the British high street, as the stormy weather that has battered southern parts of the country weather moves further north today. Bricks and mortar stores, already struggling in the face of online competition, have seen footfall down 6% on last year in the previous week. Howard Archer at IHS Global Insight writes today that the weather is likely to further reduce shopper numbers. Given retailers\u2019 hopes that the last couple of days before Christmas would see a final strong surge in sales, the awful weather could not have come at a worse time. The very wet and windy weather must have had a significant dampening impact on shopper footfall. On the face of it, this plays into the hands of the online retailers \u2013 even if presents bought now online cannot be delivered in time for Christmas, at least the givers can say they are bought and on the way! ...Certainly, retailers will be hoping that the weather later this week is not bad enough to deter shoppers from hitting the clearance sales \u2013 and given the extended squeeze on many people\u2019s purchasing power, consumers will likely be very keen to get out and take advantage of genuine bargains Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the latest events across the eurozone, the financial markets and the global economy. European markets have nudged up, after Japan\u2019s main stock index hit a six-year high. The Nikkei finished up 0.1% on Tuesday, as investors took cheer from positive US data, lifting sentiment on the global economy. Elsewhere in Asia, China\u2019s credit crunch appears to be easing, after Beijing authorities topped up $50 bn in liquidity funds they added last week. Here in Europe, Germany\u2019s DAX is up 0.8%, France\u2019s CAC has risen 0.5%. In London, the \u201csanta rally\u201d is a bit thinner: the FTSE is up 0.3% to 6698 points. But market watchers are sounding pretty hopeful about global markets. Andrea Tueni at Saxo Bank The rally should continue next year, Europe has still a big potential for a catch-up rally versus Wall street. It is another quiet day as we head into the Christmas holidays. The FTSE 100 will close today at 12.30 and European markets at 13.00 GMT. I\u2019ll be tracking this and what news we can find.",

I was thinking about retirement. I\u2019m really at the wrong age to be looking for a new career. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of uncertainty in the workforce. There are guys in their 30s with big mortgages. They are very apprehensive. \u201cI think everyone thought Holden would be around forever. The reality is we make a very good product. They are closing the doors on the Commodore V8, which was the best car we\u2019ve ever produced. That makes it harder to take. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect this level of uncertainty in my life. I joke with my wife that she\u2019ll have to keep me, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s an option. I\u2019ve still got a mortgage to pay off. I have no other option but to work, but it will be enormously hard to find one. Everyone is stunned at the moment, but it won\u2019t properly sink in until they are forced to look for another job.\u201d Darren Kirwan, Holden worker, Victoria \u201cI\u2019ve been at Holden for 13 years as an electrician. I did my apprenticeship there. I always thought there would be an opportunity to stay on. \u201cIt\u2019s been gut wrenching but I see no other outcome but the auto industry shutting down in Australia, which will have a big impact on the manufacturing industry. \u201cThere\u2019s a bit of a sombre mood at the moment. It\u2019ll be worse for the older guys as they\u2019ll have a problem getting back into the workforce. But even for the younger blokes, manufacturing will be non-existent in this country for them. There will be a lot of young people thinking \u2018What\u2019s the point of getting a trade?' \u201cI\u2019d be having second thoughts about [becoming an electrician now], certainly. If people don\u2019t build things, there\u2019s not much call for electricians. What\u2019s the point?\u201d Van Hua, cafe owner, South Australia \u201cEven though they\u2019re still working, they have to save their money now for a rainy day. If we put ourselves in their shoes, we would do the same. Their children are still young. Their family is young. They have a mortgage to pay. \u201cThere is nothing worse than finding out that you don\u2019t have a job tomorrow. You don\u2019t know if you can get another job or not, especially the older people. \u201cIndirectly or directly, the entire country will be affected. Say a husband works at Holden and his wife works in the hospital. When Holden shuts they will have just one income. This means they have to cut all their expenses, and, for example, buy less clothes for children. The clothing stores lose money. The textile guys suffers. There just won\u2019t be as much money going around.\u201d Nick Gouvousis, Holden worker, Victoria \u201cAs far as production goes, we knew the V6 line would be it. There was always a 50-50 chance we\u2019d get the next generation cars to build but I didn\u2019t think we\u2019d lose the heart of it, the engineering. \u201cNone of us saw it coming. I\u2019ll probably take a good holiday in 2017. I\u2019ve been there 25 years now but I\u2019m concerned because I don\u2019t think I\u2019m over the hill just yet. I\u2019m not even 50 and there aren\u2019t many industries that require the same skills. There will be a big rush of 20,000 people looking for a job at once. It\u2019ll all come down to whether employers like the look of you or not.\u201d Michael Claridge, car retailer, South Australia \u201cThe complexities involved in this whole issue are enormous. I don\u2019t think anyone understands what it takes to build a car. It\u2019s a very complex business and the supply lines are enormous. \u201cThe effect this will have on the SA economy is my overriding concern. There\u2019s no doubt that the flow-on effects through to suppliers will be profound. As a state we\u2019ve got some challenges ahead of us. \u201cThe Holden brand will remain, it just that vehicles will be sourced from all over the world. The product line will remain, along with its servicing and parts supply. The really disappointing thing is we won\u2019t be building them in Australia any more. \u201cWe\u2019ve got an upgrade for the Commodore coming in 18 months to two years. Holden flat out say it will be the best car to date that they\u2019ve ever produced, and will definitely outperform value and features of anything else on the market. While it\u2019s a sad day that production will cease in Australia, it sounds like we\u2019re going to go out with a bang.\u201d",
