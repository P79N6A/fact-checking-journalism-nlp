Five years ago, when I was the Guardian\u2019s women\u2019s editor, I was sent to report on gender diversity at Davos. I dragged my short, not very masculine, body to the oddly bleak Swiss village to watch the world\u2019s rich and powerful consort. Being neither rich nor powerful, it would be fair to say that I stood out. But it would be more accurate to say that I was literally overlooked during my time there, as men tend to be taller than 5ft 2. In 2012, women made up 17% of the delegates. When business and political leaders meet in Davos next week, still almost 80% of the 3,000 delegates will be men. Recognising the overwhelming proportion of men among its attendees, the WEF, which organises the talkfest each year, introduced a quota system in 2011. This meant that the group of megacorps designated \u201cstrategic partners\u201d, the 100 leading global companies, had to bring one woman for every four men. Some chose to pay for only four places rather than try to find that elusive beast, a powerful woman. Not much has changed. Anyone used to working in a male-dominated environment \u2013 and most governments and big companies are \u2013 would recognise the atmosphere in Davos. Although most of the business is done behind closed doors, men pack the stages and each gathering presents a sea of dark suits and a low-toned hubbub. I carried heels everywhere as flat snow boots meant a crooked neck, or even worse, being talked down to. There were special programmes of fun-filled events for \u201cwives\u201d, although that has changed, I think. There were brilliant women there, of course, with a series of special events and even a slightly gruesomely named Girls\u2019 Lounge, as there will be again next week. WEF has tried to bring about change and 90% of panels this year will include at least one woman. Three out of five co-chairs of the 2017 event are women, as is the head programme designer, Emma Benameur. As ever, among the younger attendees, there is a greater proportion of women. Also, the quotas have brought some change, albeit glacial. Women made up just 9% of Davos attendees in 2002. The organisers of Davos, an expensive and bewildering event, blame the fact that most global organisations rich enough to send anyone there tend to be led by men. The governments of the UK and Germany may be led by women but most European parliaments are still overwhelmingly male. Yet one third of the delegates come from non governmental organisations such as academia or the media. Go figure. Each year, studies point out that companies perform better when they have at least one woman on the board, such as one from accountancy firm Grant Thornton in 2015, called Women in business: the value of diversity. Still no major change. At the start of 2016, women as a topic ranked among the top three issues at Davos, the third most tweeted, right up there with refugees and climate change. Given where we have got to on the other two, perhaps it\u2019s no surprise that so little has changed when it comes to the number of women.",

The retailer \u2013 whose working practices were exposed by a Guardian investigation in 2015 \u2013 had pledged not use Reynolds Porter Chamberlain (RPC) for the review after protests from investors. In September, Sports Direct said an independent party other than RPC would conduct the review, which was intended to look at its boardroom structure and other management issues. Two candidates put forward by the Investor Forum to lead the review had pulled out. The Investor Forum coordinates behind the scenes negotiations between shareholders and companies. Up to 20 candidates are thought to have been considered. But on Friday, in an announcement after the stock market had closed, the company, which was founded by Mike Ashley, said it would appoint RPC to lead the much anticipated review. RPC has worked extensively for Ashley and Sports Direct, which is one of the law firm\u2019s biggest clients. Sports Direct said: \u201cThis decision has been taken in the light of recent frustrations over delays in appointing an independent party other than RPC to lead the review. These delays were due to the fact that we have twice accepted candidates who were put forward to chair the review by the Investor Forum, only for those candidates to subsequently be withdrawn. \u201cWe believe any further delays would place an unreasonable burden on the business at a time when the company should be fully focused on delivering its strategic priorities as we build towards our medium and long term aspiration to become the \u2018Selfridges\u2019 of sports retail.\u201d The Investor Forum responded: \u201cWe note the Sports Direct statement and will be discussing its implications with our members.\u201d Sports Direct\u2019s statement, which included a pledge for an external evaluation of the board later this year, follows the move earlier this month by shareholders to again reject Keith Hellawell as chairman of the retailer. At a specially convened meeting 54% of independent shareholders voted against the former police chief constable\u2019s re-election to the board.

      "bodyText": "China suffered a sharp drop in exports last year and there are fears its trading position will weaken further in 2017 with repercussions for the global economy if Donald Trump\u2019s protectionist policies prompt a trade war. A week before the billionaire\u2019s inauguration as US president, Chinese authorities expressed their concern that Trump would follow through on pledges to impose high tariffs on imports from China and to brand the country a currency manipulator. The president-elect has long maintained that China has been devaluing its currency in order to make its exports more competitive on overseas markets. Beijing\u2019s worries come against the backdrop of a slowdown in trade with figures on Friday showing exports fell for the second year running in 2016, dropping by 7.7% \u2013 the biggest fall since 2009 \u2013 with imports falling by 5.5%. The weaker than expected performance added to concerns that global demand is slowing in a climate of heightened political uncertainty and social tensions. The World Bank warned this week that a tentative pickup in the global economy is at risk from the uncertainty unleashed by Brexit and the arrival of Trump in the White House. There was also a note of caution on growth prospects from the World Economic Forum, which said before its annual meeting in Davos next week that rising income inequality posed a risk to the global economy in 2017. Policymakers and investors are waiting to see which of Trump\u2019s campaign trail pledges he will seek to push through after being sworn in on 20 January. He fought Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton on an anti-globalisation platform with a pledge to bring jobs back to America that he claimed had been lost to China and other countries. China\u2019s customs agency expressed its worries on Friday. \u201cThe trend of anti-globalisation is becoming increasingly evident, and China is the biggest victim of this trend,\u201d customs spokesman Huang Songping told reporters, according to Reuters news agency. \u201cWe will pay close attention to foreign trade policy after Trump is inaugurated president.\u201d Experts said part of China\u2019s trade slowdown in 2016 was down to a deliberate push to rebalance away from an exports-driven economy. \u201cSome of the decline is expected and intended,\u201d said Kamel Mellahi, professor of strategic management at Warwick Business School. \u201cThe focus on the domestic market, recent anti-pollution measures and supply-side policies, combined with the sluggish international demand for Chinese goods, are all having a negative impact on export.\u201d Julian Evans-Pritchard, China economist at the consultancy Capital Economics, said he saw little prospect of China\u2019s trade position improving in the near future, partly thanks to tepid global growth. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to see conditions becoming much more favourable to Chinese trade than they already are. Further upside to economic activity, both in China and abroad, is probably now limited given declines in trend growth,\u201d he said. \u201cThe risks to trade lie to the downside \u2013 the likelihood of a damaging trade spat between China and the US has risen in recent weeks following Trump\u2019s appointment of hardliners to lead US trade policy.\u201d Brian Davidson, US economist at Fathom Consulting, emphasised the potential costs to businesses in China and to American consumers if Trump\u2019s deal-making with the vast Asian economy turned sour. \u201cWe think Mr Trump is set to renegotiate the US trade relationship with China and the stakes are high: US exporters could lose access to the world\u2019s second largest economy; and US consumers might be deprived of the hundreds of billions of dollars\u2019 worth of goods that they buy from China each year,\u201d he said. Reasons to worry about the global economy in 2017 China\u2019s slowdown in exports is just one factor behind a cautious outlook for global growth in 2017. Economists are also pointing to: The US central bank raising interest rates. The Federal Reserve raised borrowing costs in December 2015 and December 2016 and has signalled more increases to come this year. On the one hand, that is a vote of confidence in the world\u2019s biggest economy. On the other, there are worries that the moves will heap pressures on emerging market economies. When US rates go up, emerging market assets become less attractive and investors shift their money elsewhere for higher returns. At the same time, higher US rates tend to increase the value of the dollar and that inflates the dollar-denominated debts of emerging market countries. A new US president with a protectionist stance. Trump has China in his sights as well as Mexico and other big US trading partners. He has announced his intention to pull out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal and has said he wants to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement between the US, Canada and Mexico. There are worries the protectionist mood will spread beyond America with inward-looking politicians such as France\u2019s Marine Le Pen gaining ground against a backdrop of growing discontent at inequality. But, in the near-term, many forecasters see a potential economic boost from Trump taking over, given his pledge to beef up state spending and cut taxes in the world\u2019s largest economy. Political uncertainty is high. It is not just Trump\u2019s arrival in the White House that is concerning investors. The UK\u2019s Brexit talks kick off this year and there are key elections in the Netherlands, France and Germany. Added to that are geopolitical tensions stemming from Russia and elsewhere so economists therefore see plenty of reasons that 2017 could again disappoint for global growth. Climate change risks. The World Economic Forum has ranked this as the second biggest risk it sees for this year behind rising income and wealth disparity. That was due in part to the increasingly frequent extreme weather that climate change heralds.",

Economists are also pointing to: </p> <ul> <li><strong>The US central bank raising interest rates.</strong> The Federal Reserve <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/14/us-federal-reserve-raises-interest-rates-second-time-since-2008\">raised borrowing costs in December 2015 and December 2016</a> and has signalled more increases to come this year. On the one hand, that is a vote of confidence in the world\u2019s biggest economy. On the other, there are worries that the moves will heap pressures on emerging market economies. When US rates go up, emerging market assets become less attractive and investors shift their money elsewhere for higher returns. At the same time, higher US rates tend to increase the value of the dollar and that inflates the dollar-denominated debts of emerging market countries.</li> </ul> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/11/inequality-world-economy-wef-brexit-donald-trump-world-economic-forum-risk-report\">Rising inequality threatens world economy, says WEF</a> </p> </aside>  <ul> <li><strong>A new US president with a protectionist stance.</strong> Trump has China in his sights as well as Mexico and other big US trading partners. He has announced his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/21/donald-trump-100-days-plans-video-trans-pacific-partnership-withdraw\">intention to pull out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal</a> and has said he wants to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement between the US, Canada and Mexico. There are worries the protectionist mood will spread beyond America with inward-looking politicians such as France\u2019s Marine Le Pen gaining ground against a backdrop of growing discontent at inequality. But, in the near-term, many forecasters see a potential economic boost from Trump taking over, given his pledge to beef up state spending and cut taxes in the world\u2019s largest economy.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Political uncertainty is high</strong>. It is not just Trump\u2019s arrival in the White House that is concerning investors. The UK\u2019s Brexit talks kick off this year and there are key elections in the Netherlands, France and Germany. Added to that are geopolitical tensions stemming from Russia and elsewhere so economists therefore see plenty of reasons that 2017 could again disappoint for global growth.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Climate change risks</strong>. The World Economic Forum has ranked this as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/11/inequality-world-economy-wef-brexit-donald-trump-world-economic-forum-risk-report\">second biggest risk it sees for this year</a> behind rising income and wealth disparity. That was due in part to the increasingly frequent extreme weather that climate change heralds.</li> </ul>",

      "bodyText": "William Hill has been accused of \u201cappalling\u201d behaviour after encouraging torch-waving staff to visit rival bookmakers and lure gamblers into its own shops with the promise of free bets. The bizarre tactic is part of William Hill\u2019s efforts to exploit a dispute between two of its competitors \u2013 Ladbrokes-Coral and Betfred \u2013 and horse-racing TV channel the Racing Partnership. The row, over the fee that the Racing Partnership charges bookies to show races, has left Ladbrokes-Coral and Betfred unable to broadcast the channel to punters. An internal William Hill memo seen by the Guardian encourages staff to exploit the impasse by taking part in what it calls the \u201ctorch challenge\u201d. This involves turning up at a rival bookmaker wielding a torch and shining it through the shop window to attract the attention of gamblers. William Hill staff then inform the customers that its stores still have rights to show the Racing Partnership channel and offer them a free bet as an enticement to defect. \u201cLet\u2019s get disruptive and make sure their punters see the light!\u201d the internal memo reads. \u201cGrab a torch and shine it around your local competitor,\u201d it continues, adding: \u201cTake your free bets down too.\u201d William Hill insisted the scheme was harmless, saying: \u201cIt is a bit of fun to highlight that we have a product that our competitors don\u2019t.\u201d But Carolyn Harris, Labour MP for Swansea East, said it displayed bookmakers\u2019 lack of respect for gamblers, some of whom are addicts. \u201cThis is indicative of the way they treat people. It\u2019s like two dogs fighting over a piece of meat and they\u2019re prepared to go to any lengths. It\u2019s pretty appalling.\u201d Harris leads a cross-party parliamentary group advocating a reduction in the maximum stake from \u00a3100 to \u00a32 on fixed odds betting terminals (FOBTs) \u2013 sometimes referred to as the \u201ccrack cocaine\u201d of gambling due to their addictive nature. She said bookmakers were nervous about the impact an ongoing parliamentary review might have on the profit they make from FOBTs. \u201cMaybe they\u2019re worried the days of FOBTs are numbered so they\u2019re trying to get more racing customers,\u201d she added. Ladbrokes said: \u201cWe\u2019re a big high street operator and we\u2019re not surprised a competitor will sink to any tactics to try and pinch our customers. We\u2019re confident our customers will appreciate what they\u2019ve already got.\u201d Betfred declined to comment. The behaviour of gambling firms has come under increasing scrutiny following a year in which industry regulator \u2013 the Gambling commission \u2013 sanctioned several firms over their failure to prevent problem gambling and money-laundering. Last year, the commission arranged voluntary settlements with bookmakers such as Paddy Power, which agreed to pay \u00a3280,000 after it was found to have encouraged a problem gambler until he lost five jobs, his home and access to his children. Betfred reached an \u00a3800,000 settlement in June after admitting it had failed to implement proper anti-money-laundering controls in accepting stolen cash from a \u201cVIP\u201d customer. In a similar case, the regulator announced an \u00a3880,000 settlement with Coral in April, after the bookmaker took hundreds of thousands of pounds from a \u201cVIP\u201d problem gambler who was using the proceeds of theft to feed his habit.",

    "webTitle": "FTSE 100 closes at another record high after US data boosts dollar - as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "For only the second week in seven months, US companies have cut the number of oil rigs on stream. According to the Baker Hughes survey, they cut 7 oil rigs and added one gas rig last week, but this is only expected to be a temporary pause as shale producers begin to boost spending. Oil prices were already lower before the figures, on concerns about a slowdown in China after worse than expected export figures and worries about whether Opec will be able to fulfil its recent agreement to cut production. Brent is currently down 0.54% at $55.71 a barrel while West Texas Intermediate is 0.77% lower at $52.60. On that note it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back next week when..... Davos. As the FTSE 100 hit yet new highs, European markets also ended the week on a high note. Positive updates from JP Morgan and Bank of America helped the European banking sector, including the beleaguered Italian banks. So the final scores in Europe showed: Germany\u2019s Dax jumped 0.94% to 11,629.18 France\u2019s Cac closed up 1.2% at 4922.49 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB finished up 1.87% at 19,514.54 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 1.11% better at 9511.6 But in Greece, the Athens market dropped 2.03% to 651.70 In the US the Dow Jones Industrial Average - which came within a whisker of breaching the 20,000 barrier a week ago - is currently down around 10 points 19,881 after losing its early gains. Not everyone is convinced the market\u2019s record breaking run can be sustained. Top fund manager Neil Woodford has just compared the current market euphoria with the dotcom bubble, with share prices rises out of sync with proper valuations. More here: On the continuing rise in the UK market, Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: Some decent data out of the US helped lift the dollar this afternoon, in the process clearing the way for the FTSE to hit a fresh high. Though both the retail sales and consumer sentiment figures, at 0.6% and 98.1 respectively, were a tad lower than expected, they still provided enough fuel for the dollar to overturn its earlier losses. Against the pound it went from half a percent down to 0.1% up, pushing sterling back under $1.22 in the process, while taking another 0.2% off the euro. The Dow Jones also reacted positively to the figures, rising around 15 points after the bell; that only just put the index over 19900, however, a level it has repeatedly struggled to escape since before Christmas. For the 12th consecutive day the FTSE 100 has closed at another record high. After drifting for the early part of the day, the leading index was boosted during the afternoon as US retail sales and confidence figures lifted the dollar and weakening the pound. As has been the case since June\u2019s Brexit vote, the fall in sterling gave a lift the to overseas earners which make up a large part of the FTSE 100. So the index finished up 45.44 points at 7337.81. This is the fourteenth day of rises, and also marks the sixth week of gains, the first time this has happened since June/July 2012. Heading into the close, the FTSE 100 is well on course for another record closing high. The fall in the pound is one factor in the gains, as it has been since the Brexit vote, but there are others. Jasper Lawler, senior market analyst at London Capital Group, said: There was a strong rebound in the pharmaceutical shares which sold-off in the wake of Donald Trump\u2019s press conference. Markets have pared bets the President-elect\u2019s hostile attitude to drug pricing would spill over to international markets. Homebuilder Barratt Developments and Kingfisher were top risers whilst disappointing economic data from China and a downturn in the price of gold hurt mining company shares including Randgold Resources. Bank of America reported earnings per share ahead of estimates in results that bode well for other money-centre banks....Shares of UK-listed banks including Barclays, RBS and HSBC responded positively to the US results. On the pound, he said: This week the pound dropped to a three-month low against the dollar and a two-month low versus the euro. Next Tuesday Theresa May will set out the long-awaited approach the government will take before triggering article 50. The PM has difficult balancing act of trying to offer some more clarity to the British public, parliament and financial markets without losing the upper hand in negotiations with the EU. If the Prime Minister confirms the UK will leave the single market in a \u201cHard Brexit\u201d, the British pound could drop below 1.20 against the dollar, and quite possibly into \u201cflash crash\u201d territory soon thereafter. More likely the PM will be a little coyer. The uncertainty of being unspecific is not good for Sterling either, but leaving the door open to staying in the single market should support the pound. There is a lot of UK economic data on tap next week too, but it will likely play second fiddle to politics. On Tuesday there is inflation data, Wednesday unemployment data and Friday sees the release of retail sales data. Back with the situation in Greece, and German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble has suggested the EU might take over the country\u2019s bailout if the International Monetary Fund decided not to get involved. Here is the report from EurActiv via Reuters: Berlin is weighing up the possibility of the EU taking over theGreek bailout in the event that the International Monetary Fund decides to end its role in it, German Minister of Finance Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble said on Friday. In an interview with S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung , Sch\u00e4uble floated the idea that if the IMF decides to pull out, Europe could figure out its \u201cown solution\u201d within the eurozone. He added, though, that such a solution must guarantee a strict implementation of the bailout\u2019s terms. \u201cIf we continue solely then we will have to better guarantee the agreements ... This role could be assigned to the ESM,\u201d he emphasised, saying that if the absence of the IMF brings major changes [to the agreement] then the new conditions will need the approval of the German parliament - which is preparing for elections next autumn. However, Sch\u00e4uble warned that if the Greek side does not deliver on its commitments, it will be the end of the current programme, and new negotiations will be required. It is the first time that the Merkel government has proposed a solution to the Greek crisis without the IMF. In Athens, this change of heart is described as unprecedented, because ever since the first bailout, Germany has insisted that the IMF must take part, on account of the European Commission\u2019s supervisory mechanism. Unsurprisingly, US consumer sentiment was dominated by the political situation given the election of Donald Trump as president. The survey\u2019s chief economist Richard Curtin said: The post-election surge in optimism was accompanied by an unprecedented degree of both positive and negative concerns about the incoming administration spontaneously mentioned when asked about economic news. The importance of government policies and partisanship has sharply risen over the past half century. From 1960 to 2000, the combined average of positive and negative references to government policies was just 6%; during the past six years, this proportion averaged 20%, and rose to new peaks in early January, with positive and negative references totaling 44%. This extraordinary level of partisanship has had a dramatic impact on economic expectations. In early January, the partisan divide on the Expectations Index was a stunning 42.7 points (108.9 among those who favorably mentioned government policies, and 66.2 among those who made unfavorable references). Needless to say, these extreme differences would imply either strong growth or a recession. Since neither is likely, one would anticipate that both extreme views will be tempered in the months ahead. Nonetheless, it should be noted that among the majority of consumers who referred to neither positive nor negative views on government, the Expectations Index was a strong 90.9, supporting a real consumption growth of 2.7% in 2017. After slightly disappointing US retail sales figures come some slightly disappointing confidence figures, although the figures remain high. The preliminary University of Michigan survey of consumer sentiment came in at 98.1 in January, down from 98.2 in December and below expections of a figure of 98.5. Continuing worries about Brexit, reinforced after Thursday\u2019s news that UK prime minister Theresa May will make a speech on the subject on Tuesday, have put more pressure on the pound. It it on course for its fifth week of falls in the last six against the dollar, and is currently down 0.21% at $1.2137. Against the euro it has fallen 0.16% to \u20ac1.1437. If it closes at this level it will be the lowest since 9 November. The weak pound of course has boosted the prospects for the overseas earners which make up a large proportion of the FTSE 100, lifting the index 0.46% to 7325 and on course for yet another record closing high. Meanwhile the Dow Jones Industrial Average is edging closer to the elusive 20,000 barrier, up 0.14% to 19,918. In case you missed it, there is more controversy in the confectionary world following the decision by the makers of Toblerone to cut costs by widening the gaps between the chocolate peaks. US food manufacturing giant Mondel\u0113z, which makes Toblerone, has further angered consumers by announcing plans to hike the price of its Cadbury\u2019s Freddo bars from 25p to 30p in the spring. Mondel\u0113z said it was selectively increasing prices as a \u201clast resort\u201d. Read our full story: US markets are up a touch, with decent US retail sales and strong quarterly earnings from Bank of America and JP Morgan Chase providing some cheer. Dow Jones: +0.1% at 19,919 S&amp;P 500: +0.1% at 2,274 Nasdaq: +0.2% at 5,558 Here is our full story on the investigation into the \u201cflash crash\u201d in the pound last October, which stunned traders and policymakers: IG expects US markets to open modestly higher: Reaction is coming in to those US retail sales figures, which showed growth of 0.6% in December. It was a touch below expectations of a 0.7% rise. Rob Carnell, chief international economist at ING, said the figures were good enough to justify a March hike in US interest rates: US December retail sales were not as good as had been expected. But having said that, the consensus was aggressively optimistic, and sales were not particularly weak in an absolute sense, with both main measures showing gains over the previous month. There is therefore no good reason why this data should deter the Fed from hiking rates again at their March meeting if they want to do so, which we think they do. Markets are still anticipating a very cautious Fed, with only about a 30% chance of a March hike, in contrast to our own forecast that the Fed does hike by another 25 basis points at the March meeting. Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics, said there was nothing to suggest consumer spending would weaken in the first half of 2017: With consumer confidence surging to multi-year highs after the election and employment / wage growth still solid, there is no reason to suspect that consumption growth is going to weaken in the first half of this year. Particularly not when households will be anticipating a potentially big decline in tax rates at some point this year. Sticking with the US, the reporting season for banks is underway. Bank of America and JP Morgan Chase have both reported a sharp rise in quarterly earnings, boosted by a surge in activity following Donald Trump\u2019s victory in the US presidential election. Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JP Morgan Chase, said America\u2019s largest bank by assets had grown market share in virtually all of its businesses in the three months to 31 December. He added: The US economy may be building momentum. Looking ahead there is opportunity for good, rational and thoughtful policy decisions to be implemented, which would spur growth, create jobs for Americans across the income spectrum and help communities. US retail sales grew by 0.6% in December according to figures just in from the Commerce Department. It was a touch below expectations of a 0.7% increase, but November\u2019s growth figure was revised up to 0.2% from 0.1%. Growth in December was fuelled by higher demand for cars, with sales up 2.4%. When cars were taken out of the equation, retail sales were up 0.2%. Overall, the figures are likely to be taken as sign that the world\u2019s largest economy was in decent shape at the end of 2016. Over in the US, figures are expected to show US retail sales rose 0.7% in December, following a 0.1% rise in November. The data lands at 13.30 UK time. Oil prices continue to slide and are on course for the first weekly fall since late December. Crude has been hit by concerns about whether the production cuts agreed by Opec in November will stick, and the fall in Chinese exports reported earlier had added to the negative sentiment, since it casts doubt on the strength of the world\u2019s second largest economy. So Brent is currently down 1% at $55.43 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate has fallen a similar amount to $52.44. The FTSE 100 is on course to close at a record high for the 12th straight day. Here\u2019s an update of trading across Europe\u2019s main markets: FTSE 100: +0.4% at 7,318 Germany\u2019s DAX: +0.6% at 11,591 French CAC: +0.9% at 4,907 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: +1.6% at 19,456 Spain\u2019s IBEX: +0.9% at 9,489 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: +0.6% at 365 The Bank for International Settlements has published its report on the \u201cflash crash\u201d in the pound in October. The Guardian\u2019s Jill Treanor reports: October\u2019s flash crash in the pound - when the currency nose dived 9% against the dollar in Asian trading hours - was caused by a combination of inexperienced traders, algorithmic trading and complex trading positions, according to an official report. The flash crash sparked a range of theories about why the pound fell so fast in just a few seconds after midnight.After an investigation by the Bank for International Settlements it is far from clear what caused the slide in the pound, which nose dived from $1.26 to$1.1491, before recovering again. While it says it cannot rule out \u201cfat fingers\u201d - mistaken trading - or attempts at market abuse, the BIS concludes there is little evidence to substantiate the claims. Instead it points to a combination of inexperienced traders, algorithmic trading and complex trading positions being implemented at a time of day when the pound would not usually be trading. No big losses were suffered by the big players in the markets and some of the trades which took place as sterling plunged were cancelled, the report said. Whatever the cause of the initial selling in sterling, the market was likely to be vulnerable at that time of day to sharp moves and an associated withdrawal of liquidity. Gold has been hitting seven-week highs above $1,200 an ounce this week and is hovering just below that level this morning. The World Gold Council believes gold will continue to shine this year, despite some concerns that the strength of the US dollar could limit its appeal. In its outlook for 2017, the organisation argues that demand for gold will be underpinned by a number of factors including heightened geopolitical risks, currency depreciation (euro and pound) and growing inflation expectations. Looking back at 2016, it says: \u201cThe gold price had a strong performance in 2016, rising close to 10% in US dollar terms making it one of the best performing assets last year, despite a post-US election pullback. And the price has gained more than 5% since the Federal Reserve increased rates in mid-December.\u201d Gold always thrives on uncertainty and there is plenty of that at present. The unknowns presented by US president-elect Donald Trump, who will be inaugurated on 20 January, Britain\u2019s exit negotiations with the EU, and elections in the Netherlands, France and Germany should all boost demand for bullion, seen as a safe haven in times of trouble. Berenberg\u2019s chart of the week features the global manufacturing sector. The German bank says purchasing managers indices for major regions suggest an upturn is underway. Holger Schmieding, chief economist, says: All major regions, manufacturing is picking up. While turning at different times, purchasing managers indexes in the US, China, Germany and the UK are rising. Along with stable gains in employment, the pick-up in export-orientated manufacturing reflects growing optimism and willingness to spend by businesses and households. More investment in long-lived capital could generate the productivity gains that have been woefully weak recently. He asks, will the upswing continue? Answer: US households are the global consumer of last resort; their spending patterns shape global trends, for better, and for worse. Done right, pro-growth policies should boost US demand growth over the coming years, supporting gains in global goods demand and manufacturing output. Of course, the downside risks linked to the new administration\u2019s potential policies are profound. International trade remains a significant wildcard. Trump has proposed to impose tariffs and erect other barriers to imports, which could trigger tit-for-tat responses for trade partners, thus inhibiting international trade and cross border flows of goods. On balance, we do not expect Congress to approve such proposals and are optimistic the upturn will continue. German Chancellor Angela Merkel will chair a cabinet meeting on Brexit next week, a government spokesman has said. The ministerial committee on Brexit will meet for the first time on Wednesday to discuss organisational and structural issues as it prepares for formal negotiations with Britain to begin. Finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, economy minister Sigmar Gabriel, foreign minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier and Merkel\u2019s chief of staff Peter Altmaier will be among those to attend the meeting. Government spokesman Steffen Seibert, said: The committee will deal with preparations for negotiations on Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union, preparations within the federal government as well as by the European institutions.\u201d Arnaud Masset, market analyst at the internet bank Swissquote, considers the dollar\u2019s prospects: The dollar index rose almost 1% ahead of [Trump\u2019s press] conference but quickly reversed gains, sliding as much as 2% since then, down to 100.72 before stabilising at around 101.30. The market does not expect much from Trump\u2019s investiture next week as it will most likely be in the same vein. Against this backdrop, we expect the market will pay increasing attention to US fundamentals and to the Federal Reserve. Obviously this will not happen overnight as investors still expect a lot from the Trump presidency; however, they have also started to realised that they were somewhat overoptimistic. We remain bearish on the US dollar and expect high quality commodity and emerging market currencies to continue rallying. However, in the short-term, the Trump story will remain the main driver in the foreign exchange market, meaning that event risk is definitely something to monitor, especially the President-elect\u2019s Twitter feed. The US dollar is heading for its worst week in two months when measured against a basket of six major currencies. The dollar index was down slightly for a third day and 1% lower over the week. Currency traders were left disappointed by lack of policy detail from Donald Trump when he gave a press conference on Wednesday. The US president-elect talked about his plans to build a wall on the border with Mexico, but there was no detail on potential fiscal stimulus. Nomura\u2019s Jordan Rochester has a view: It opens up the possibility for the market that he could go down the more toxic route which is becoming more protective on trade. Therefore it\u2019s quite prudent for investors that the dollar is a bit softer. Saunders in one line: The BoE\u2019s Michael Saunders is also highlighting the shift in recent years in Britain\u2019s labour market to a gig economy and more self-employment. In the last five years, the numbers of people that are self-employed has risen by 14%, the number of agency workers is up by about 30%, and the number of businesses registered in the UK is up by 40%. There has been also been the expansion of zero hours contracts and the \u201cgig economy\u201d. Among people in work, the proportion that are full-time employees (ie not self-employed, not part-time, not in a temporary job) remains well below pre-recession levels. Of course, some people may prefer flexible work structures or seek to reinvent their career through self-employment. But, given that on average these less secure forms of work are also less well-paid, the expansion of contingent work probably also reflects the erosion of secure and well-paid jobs from technological gains and greater emphasis on cost control. Saunders suggests the prospects for wage rises in the UK are not great: Michael Saunders, external member of the Bank of England\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee, is speaking at a Resolution Foundation in London. Saunders said the jobless rate may not rise as high this year as the Bank was forecasting in the November inflation report. Policymakers predicted the jobless rate would rise to 5.4% by the end of 2017 from a current 11-year low of 4.8%, Economic growth has recently been stronger than expected. Rather than the rise in unemployment forecast in the November inflation report, it seems quite possible to me that the jobless rate will stay below 5% this year. Conor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, points out that the weak trade data from China is limiting the FTSE\u2019s gains this morning: After squeaking to a fresh peak last night, making it a record 11 consecutive sessions of closing highs, the FTSE quickly began to build above 7300 this Friday. The FTSE likely could have managed something a bit more robust this morning if it weren\u2019t for weak data from China weighing on the miners. With Chinese exports seeing their biggest yearly drop since 2009, down 7.7% across 2016, and imports falling a troublesome 5.5%, the likes of Rio Tinto and Antofagasta found themselves in the red as Friday got underway. Over in the Eurozone there wasn\u2019t really much to work with, though this didn\u2019t stop the DAX and CAC rising by 0.4% and 0.5% respectively. On the corporate front it\u2019s a bit calmer this morning following Retail Super Thursday yesterday. (You can read a handy round-up of how the various retailers performed over Christmas here.) There have been a few updates this morning: Pub group Mitchells and Butler had a merry Christmas, with like-for-like sales growth of 4.7% in the four weeks to 7 January 2017. In the first quarter overall (covering the 15 weeks to 7 Jan), like-for-like sales were up 1.7%. More here. Fortnum &amp; Mason were another Christmas winner, as shoppers flocked to the upmarket department store for hampers, caviar and white truffles. Like-for-like sales rose 16% in the five weeks to 1 January. Things appear less rosy at Countrywide. The estate agent said it expected to report a 6% fall in transactions for 2016 and predicted a further slowdown in 2017. The FTSE 100 has hit a new record high and is on course to extend its longest ever winning streak. The index is currently up 27 points or 0.4% at 7,320. Europe\u2019s major markets are all higher this morning: FTSE 100: +0.4% at 7,320 Germany\u2019s DAX: +0.4% at 11,570 France\u2019s CAC: +0.5% at 4,887 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: +1.2% at 19,387 Spain\u2019s IBEX: +0.3% at 9,439 Over in the currency markets, one-week sterling volatility jumped to the highest since early November as Theresa May prepares to give a speech on Brexit on Tuesday, hitting 14.275 according to Reuters. It is expected to be a major speech from the prime minister outlining her plans for Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union. As economists at Investec note, the speech \u201cwill almost certainly have implications for sterling\u201d. The pound is currently up 0.2% against the dollar at $1.2181. Also coming up.... Michael Saunders, an external member of the Bank of England\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee, will be giving a speech later this morning at the Resolution Foundation in London. Economists and investors will be looking for any clues on the latest thinking at Threadneedle Street. Traders and economists will also be looking out for US retail sales (13.30 UK time), for signs of how the broader economy was performing at the end of 2016. And of course we\u2019ll be monitoring the markets to see whether the FTSE 100 can extend its record run of rises...the indication from early trading is yes, with the index up 29 points at 7,321. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Trade data from China has disappointed, with exports falling 7.7% in 2016, the biggest drop since 2009. Imports fell 5.5%. The weaker-than-expected performance will raise fears that global demand is slowing, in Europe and elsewhere. Another major concern is the prospect of a trade war between China and the US, once Donald Trump is in the White House. The president-elect has already signalled he will take a tough stance against China. Julian Evans-Pritchard, China economist at Capital Economics, says it is difficult to see any improvement in China\u2019s trade position any time soon: Looking ahead, it\u2019s hard to see conditions becoming much more favourable to Chinese trade than they already are. Further upside to economic activity, both in China and abroad, is probably now limited given declines in trend growth. Instead, the risks to trade lie to the downside \u2013 the likelihood of a damaging trade spat between China and the US has risen in recent weeks following Trump\u2019s appointment of hardliners to lead US trade policy.",

Markets have pared bets the President-elect\u2019s hostile attitude to drug pricing would spill over to international markets. </p> <p>Homebuilder Barratt Developments and Kingfisher were top risers whilst disappointing economic data from China and a downturn in the price of gold hurt mining company shares including Randgold Resources.</p> <p>Bank of America reported earnings per share ahead of estimates in results that bode well for other money-centre banks....Shares of UK-listed banks including Barclays, RBS and HSBC responded positively to the US results. </p> </blockquote> <p>On the pound, he said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This week the pound dropped to a three-month low against the dollar and a two-month low versus the euro. Next Tuesday Theresa May will set out the long-awaited approach the government will take before triggering article 50. The PM has difficult balancing act of trying to offer some more clarity to the British public, parliament and financial markets without losing the upper hand in negotiations with the EU.</p> <p>If the Prime Minister confirms the UK will leave the single market in a \u201cHard Brexit\u201d, the British pound could drop below 1.20 against the dollar, and quite possibly into \u201cflash crash\u201d territory soon thereafter. More likely the PM will be a little coyer. The uncertainty of being unspecific is not good for Sterling either, but leaving the door open to staying in the single market should support the pound. </p> <p>There is a lot of UK economic data on tap next week too, but it will likely play second fiddle to politics. On Tuesday there is inflation data, Wednesday unemployment data and Friday sees the release of retail sales data.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-01-13T16:24:21.741Z\">at 4.24pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5878eebfe4b0f10ba20b7de1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-01-13T15:38:53.244Z\">3.38pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Back with the situation in Greece, and German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble has suggested the EU might take over the country\u2019s bailout if the International Monetary Fund decided not to get involved.

Balanced on blinis, tucked into bagels or crafted into sushi, salmon has become an everyday luxury in the UK. But fans of seafood may be forced to take it off the menu as prices are expected to soar because of a surge in sea lice hitting production. Wholesale salmon prices leapt as much as 50% last year after severe problems in Norway and Scotland with the tiny parasites, which feed on the blood and tissue of salmon. The problem followed a supply shortage caused by a deadly algae bloom in Chile, the world\u2019s second biggest producer of farmed salmon. Global supplies of Atlantic salmon fell nearly 9% last year and are expected to fall during the first half of this year as lice problems worsen, according to fish industry analysts at the Norwegian bank Nordea. The top five salmon farms in Norway, the world\u2019s largest producer of salmon, produced 60,000 tonnes less fish than expected last year, about a 6% drop, according to Nordea. In Scotland, production dropped 4% to 171,722 tonnes in 2015. It was forecast to improve last year but the target is unlikely to be reached because of the sea lice and amoebic gill disease, a potentially fatal illness caused by another parasite, which arrived in the UK five years ago. Both pests have become more common on fish farms in recent years, with experts blaming warming sea temperatures associated with climate change. The parasites\u2013 a tough marine cousin of the wood louse \u2013 attach themselves to the skin, fins or gills and feed on the fish. One major international producer, Marine Harvest, said the volume of salmon it produced in Scotland had slumped by 16%, or 1,500 tonnes, in the summer, partly because it accidentally killed 175,000 fish while trying to treat them for lice using a device called a thermolicer. The device, which immerses fish in a warm bath, is one of a number of methods fish farmers are trying to control sea lice as an alternative to chemicals. Other methods include the hydrolicer, which bathes fish in fresh water, and employing \u201ccleaner fish\u201d such as wrasse and lumpsuckers, which eat the lice. New legislation on the control of lice comes into force in Scotland this year, after a similar move in Norway, where farmers are trying tarpaulin \u201cskirts\u201d around the upper parts of sea cages containing the salmon in a bid to stop sea lice larvae from getting in \u2013 or out. Lance Forman, owner of H Forman &amp; Son, a smoked salmon curer which supplies several major supermarkets, said he had been forced to put prices up three times last year as the cost of the Scottish farmed salmon had gone up as much as 100%. \u201cIt\u2019s been crazy,\u201d agreed Scott Unwin, of Bobbys Fish, a Billingsgate trader. He estimated that prices had gone up by as much as 50% in the past four to six months and said supplies were short. \u201cI\u2019ve been at Billingsgate 30 years and I\u2019ve never seen it so bad,\u201d he said. Forman said prices in supermarkets had risen by only about 17% in the past year because suppliers and retailers had absorbed some costs rather than pass them all on to shoppers. \u201cThere\u2019s also shrinkflation. Shops know customers only want to pay \u00a34 for a pack and so rather than put the price up they make the packet size smaller,\u201d he said. Industry analysts say price rises have been slow to filter through to supermarket shelves because fish is generally bought on six- to 12-month contracts and salmon is one of a basket of items targeted in the supermarket price war with discounters Aldi and Lidl. Major supermarkets keep prices down on luxuries such as salmon, especially at Christmas, to try to tempt shoppers through their doors. But signs are emerging that prices are now on the way up. Morrisons highlighted the pressure on salmon prices last week while market research firm Kantar Worldpanel pointed to fish prices as a key contributor to the first period of food price inflation since September 2014. \u2022 This article was amended on 18 January 2017. An earlier version said Chile was the world\u2019s biggest producer of farmed salmon, and Norway the second largest. This has been corrected to say Norway is the world\u2019s largest producer, and Chile the second biggest.",

      "bodyText": "Hundreds of chambermaids, doormen and cocktail waiters have been flown to Davos to cater to every whim of world leaders, business executives and the super-rich who will descend next week on the Swiss Alps town for the annual World Economic Forum (WEF) celebration of capitalism. While WEF guests, including Theresa May, Chinese leader Xi Jinping and South African president Jacob Zuma, will spend their nights in some of the world\u2019s most luxurious hotel suites, the staff brought in to serve them will be sleeping up to five to a room in bunk beds. The manager of the fanciest hotel in Davos \u2013 the Grandhotel Belv\u00e9d\u00e8re \u2013 said he had flown in 200 extra staff to work in shifts around the clock during the annual jamboree of the rich and powerful. \u201cWe normally have about 100 employees, but this week we have 300 to help us out,\u201d Thomas Kleber, general manager of the Belv\u00e9d\u00e8re, said. Kleber said the extra staff have been flown in from partner hotels across the world to help out during the Belv\u00e9d\u00e8re\u2019s busiest week of the year, but because the whole of Davos is packed out with forum visitors there isn\u2019t much space to accommodate the additional workers. \u201cWe have a staff house, but at this time of the year it is getting cosy,\u201d he explained. \u201cWe do have some different places with four or five people in one room. We have set up high beds with one sleeping on top and one underneath.\u201d Despite the contrasting sleeping arrangements, a key theme of this year\u2019s conference will be rising inequality, which the WEF has warned is the biggest problem facing the world. The forum said the growing gap between rich and poor, which it said had helped trigger the UK\u2019s Brexit vote and Donald Trump\u2019s presidential victory, had led the west to \u201ca tipping point and might now embark on a period of deglobalisation\u201d. The WEF has organised six sessions for Davos visitors to discuss inequality, including one entitled \u201cCombating rising insecurity and inequality\u201d, to be introduced by the WEF\u2019s chief economist, Jennifer Blanke. Another session will explore rising inequality through a \u201cvisual exploration that reveals the causes and consequences of fragility in cities now and through time\u201d. The extra Belv\u00e9d\u00e8re staff include \u201cspecially recruited people just for mixing cocktails\u201d, as well as baristas, cooks, waiters, doormen, chambermaids and receptionists. The Belv\u00e9d\u00e8re is the focus of most Davos action, including top-level diplomatic meetings, the signing of billion-dollar business deals and, of course, the best parties. The WEF organisers have taken control of 85% of the hotel\u2019s rooms to host world leaders, business people and celebrities, who this year include Grammy award-winner Shakira and Jamie Oliver. Not even Kleber knows the identities of his guests due to security concerns, but he said in previous years that Bill Clinton, David Cameron, Ban Ki-moon and John Kerry stayed at the hotel. \u201cThere are always a lot of big famous people, big business bosses and state visitors,\u201d he said. The Belv\u00e9d\u00e8re will host more than 300 functions over five days, with the first executive coffee bar meetings starting at 6am and the last of the late-night parties not turning out until 3am. \u201cWe have all kinds of functions from breakfast meetings, politician lunches to nightcaps and cocktail receptions in every corner of the hotel. Every company and every single party has its own individual needs,\u201d he said. \u201cIce sculptures are always part of it.\u201d Kleber declined to provide any details of what parties the hotel will be hosting this year, or how much the hotel charges for hosting events. Last year, a Silicon Valley tech company was reportedly charged \u00a36,000 for a short meeting with the president of Estonia in a converted luggage room. The hotel has also previously flown in New England lobster, and provided special Mexican food for a company that was meeting a Mexican politician. \u201cI assume [the staff] get good tips,\u201d Kleber said, but \u201cmost of them are not coming for the money \u2013 they are coming to be part of a once-in-a-year event \u2026 Of course it\u2019s hard work, but it\u2019s a lot of fun,\u201d he added. Theresa May will be the only G7 leader to attend this year\u2019s summit, which clashes with Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration as the 45th US president. Downing Street refused to state which events or parties May plans to attend in her two-day Alpine sojourn. Last year, Cameron was photographed partying tie-less with Bono, Leonardo DiCaprio and Kevin Spacey, at a lavish party hosted by Jack Ma, the founder of internet group Alibaba and China\u2019s richest man with a $34.5bn (\u00a328.5bn) fortune. Tony Blair, who also attended the Ma party last year, is also a regular at the glitziest events. Travelling to Davos and finding anywhere to stay next week is very expensive, but not nearly as costly as getting an all-access pass to the schmoozing. Basic membership of the WEF and an entry ticket costs 68,000 Swiss francs (\u00a355,400), and that will only grant access to general sessions. To get access to all areas, corporations must pay to become Strategic Partners of the WEF, costing SFr600,000, which allows a CEO to bring up to four colleagues, or flunkies, along with them. They must still pay SFr18,000 each for tickets. All Strategic Partners have been told that at least one of their invitees must be a woman. Strategic Partners are given access to all private sessions, and a car and driver with a special sticker allowing door-to-door pickup. Just 100 companies are able to become Strategic Partners; among them this year are Barclays, BT, BP, Facebook, Google and HSBC. Companies have privately complained about the cost of the exclusive access, which helped the WEF bring in record revenue of SFr228m last year, according to its annual report. The most exclusive invite in town is to an uber-glamorous party thrown jointly by Russian billionaire Oleg Deripaska and British financier Nat Rothschild at the oligarch\u2019s palatial chalet, a 15-minute chauffeur-driven car ride up the mountain from Davos. In previous years, Swiss police have reportedly been called to Deripaska\u2019s home after complaints about the noise of his Cossack band. A former assistant to economist Nouriel Roubini has described Deripaska\u2019s parties as \u201cendless streams of the finest champagne, vodka, and Russian caviar amidst dancing Cossacks and beautiful Russian models\u201d. Sandra Navidi, who was Roubini\u2019s director of research, recalled her trip to Deripaska\u2019s party in her book Superhubs: How the Financial Elite and their Networks Rule our World. Many of this year\u2019s guests, who include outgoing US vice-president Joe Biden, China\u2019s two richest men, and London mayor Sadiq Khan, will travel on private jets to nearby airports before transferring by helicopter to escape the traffic on the approach to the picturesque town. So many jets are expected that the Swiss government has opened up D\u00fcbendorf military airfield, an 85-mile helicopter flight away, to accommodate them. Adam Twidell, chief executive of private jet booking service PrivateFly, said there were 1,700 private jet flights in and out of nearby airports last year, and he expected about 10% more this year. The increase in private jet flights \u2013 which each burn as much fuel in one hour as typical use of a car does in a year \u2013 comes as the WEF warns that climate change is the second most important global concern. In its annual global risks report the WEF noted that environmental concerns were more prominent in the paper, drawn from 700 experts, than ever before. Twidell said a last-minute flight to Davos from London on a small private jet would cost about \u00a37,860. \u201cClients we have booked so far include business leaders, heads of state and government individuals,\u201d he said. \u201c[But] it\u2019s not just pure politicians and business people who are wanting to be seen at Davos. The parties there have become a place to be. Davos is now on \u2018the circuit\u2019 along with the Superbowl, the Champions League final and the Monaco Grand Prix.\u201d The rich and powerful at Davos Christine Lagarde The managing director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) is a firm fixture at the WEF, and will participate in at least three panels at this year\u2019s conference including \u201cSqueezed and Angry: How to fix the middle-class crisis\u201d, and another on how to \u201cchallenge stereotypes and institutional inertia to achieve gender parity within our lifetimes\u201d, as well as being keynote speaker on the wider challenges facing the economy this year. Lagarde, formerly a French minister, was recently found guilty of negligence in approving a massive payout of taxpayers\u2019 money to controversial French businessman Bernard Tapie but avoided a jail sentence. The court decided she should not be punished and that the conviction would not constitute a criminal record. On Monday evening the IMF gave her its full support. Theresa May The UK prime minister will be at Davos for the first time this year. May is not listed to appear on any panels, and the No 10 press office declined to provide any details of May\u2019s itinerary. David Cameron used his speech at Davos last year to reassure global business leaders that Britain would stay in the European Union. Cameron said he wanted to \u201cconfront this issue, I want to deal with it\u201d. \u201cMy aim is absolutely clear: I want to secure the future of Britain in a reformed European Union,\u201d he said. Shakira The Grammy award-winning Colombian singer-songwriter will be at Davos in her role as a global ambassador for Unicef. She follows in the footsteps of other celebrities, including Bono, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Will.i.am, who have spoken at Davos to promote their charitable interests. Shakira will be promoting her Pies Descalzos / Barefoot Foundation, which helps provide education to poor and vulnerable children. Matt Damon The Talented Mr Ripley and Good Will Hunting actor will be at Davos to talk about his continuing efforts to provide clean water to developing countries. Damon, who founded charity Water.org, will speak at a session hosted by CNBC. In 2014, Damon told Davos that having travelled in developing countries he \u201cstarted to get a real appreciation for the magnitude of the water crisis\u201d. Xi Jinping The Chinese president will lead an 80-strong delegation of business executives and billionaires to Davos. He is the first Chinese president to attend the WEF, and his visit is a statement of intent that China wants to assume a global leadership role as other world powers struggle with domestic tumult. Joe Biden The outgoing US vice-president will be at Davos, which runs until Friday \u2013 the same day as Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration. Biden, who will travel to Switzerland on Air Force 2, will \u201cdeliver remarks on the cancer moonshot and deliver an address on foreign policy\u201d, the White House said. Sheryl Sandberg The chief operating officer of Facebook, who has amassed a $1.3bn fortune from the social network according to Forbes, will speak at a panel about how older world leaders can harness the optimism of youth. The panel also includes: Meg Whitman, CEO of Hewlett Packard; Last King of Scotland actor Forest Whitaker, and Juan Manuel Santos, the president of Colombia. Sir Martin Sorrell Britain\u2019s best-paid boss \u2013 who collected \u00a370.5m from his advertising company WPP last year \u2013 will speak at a panel entitled \u201cSize Matters: The Future of Big Business\u201d. They will discuss how \u201cfewer than 10% of the world\u2019s public companies account for 80% of all profits. What does operating at this scale mean for competition, collaboration and innovation?\u201d Eric Schmidt The chairman of Google\u2019s parent company Alphabet is a regular at Davos, although he is not lined up to speak at any panels this year. Schmidt, 61, is the world\u2019s 36th richest man with a $11bn fortune, according to Forbes. Jack Ma The founder of Chinese internet group Alibaba is China\u2019s richest man with a $34.5bn fortune, according to the Bloomberg billionaires index. Last year he hosted a lavish party attended by David Cameron, Bono, Leonardo DiCaprio and Kevin Spacey. Jamie Oliver The British celebrity chef-turned businessman will be interviewed by Huffington Post founder Arianna Huffington about \u201cdriving a healthy and sustainable food revolution\u201d. Oliver, who is worth $400m according to the Sunday Times rich list, was recently forced to close six of his Italian restaurants after tough trading and the \u201cpressures and unknowns\u201d following the Brexit vote. Khalid al-Falih Saudia Arabia\u2019s energy minister will be in demand as a key voice on Opec after the oil-producing countries recently agreed to cut output sending oil prices soaring. Al-Falih, who is also chairman of state oil and gas giant Saudi Aramco, has been put in charge of leading Saudi Arabia Vision 2030 \u2013 the country\u2019s plan to diversify away from oil dependency.",

We have set up high beds with one sleeping on top and one underneath.\u201d</p> <p>Despite the contrasting sleeping arrangements, a key theme of this year\u2019s conference will be rising inequality, which the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/11/inequality-world-economy-wef-brexit-donald-trump-world-economic-forum-risk-report\"> WEF has warned </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/11/inequality-world-economy-wef-brexit-donald-trump-world-economic-forum-risk-report\">is the biggest problem facing the world. </a>The forum said the growing gap between rich and poor, which it said had helped trigger the UK\u2019s Brexit vote and Donald Trump\u2019s presidential victory, had led the west to \u201ca tipping point and might now embark on a period of deglobalisation\u201d.</p> <p>The WEF has organised six sessions for Davos visitors to discuss inequality, including one entitled \u201cCombating rising insecurity and inequality\u201d, to be introduced by the WEF\u2019s chief economist, Jennifer Blanke. Another session will explore rising inequality through a \u201cvisual exploration that reveals the causes and consequences of fragility in cities now and through time\u201d. </p> <p>The extra Belv\u00e9d\u00e8re staff include \u201cspecially recruited people just for mixing cocktails\u201d, as well as baristas, cooks, waiters, doormen, chambermaids and receptionists. </p> <p>The Belv\u00e9d\u00e8re is the focus of most Davos action, including top-level diplomatic meetings, the signing of billion-dollar business deals and, of course, the best parties. The WEF organisers have taken control of 85% of the hotel\u2019s rooms to host world leaders, business people and celebrities, who this year include Grammy award-winner Shakira and Jamie Oliver.</p> <p>Not even Kleber knows the identities of his guests due to security concerns, but he said in previous years that Bill Clinton, David Cameron, Ban Ki-moon and John Kerry stayed at the hotel. \u201cThere are always a lot of big famous people, big business bosses and state visitors,\u201d he said. </p> <p>The Belv\u00e9d\u00e8re will host more than 300 functions over five days, with the first executive coffee bar meetings starting at 6am and the last of the late-night parties not turning out until 3am. \u201cWe have all kinds of functions from breakfast meetings, politician lunches to nightcaps and cocktail receptions in every corner of the hotel. Every company and every single party has its own individual needs,\u201d he said. \u201cIce sculptures are always part of it.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/12/ilo-warns-of-rise-in-social-unrest-and-migration-as-inequality-widens\">ILO warns of rise in social unrest and migration as inequality widens</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Kleber declined to provide any details of what parties the hotel will be hosting this year, or how much the hotel charges for hosting events. Last year, a Silicon Valley tech company was reportedly charged \u00a36,000 for a short meeting with the president of Estonia in a converted luggage room. The hotel has also previously flown in New England lobster, and provided special Mexican food for a company that was meeting a Mexican politician. </p> <p>\u201cI assume [the staff] get good tips,\u201d Kleber said, but \u201cmost of them are not coming for the money \u2013 they are coming to be part of a once-in-a-year event \u2026 Of course it\u2019s hard work, but it\u2019s a lot of fun,\u201d he added. </p> <p>Theresa May will be the only G7 leader to attend this year\u2019s summit, which clashes with Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration as the 45th US president.</p> <p>Downing Street refused to state which events or parties May plans to attend in her two-day Alpine sojourn. Last year, <a href=\"http://shanghaiist.com/2016/01/22/jack_ma_davos_party.php\">Cameron was photographed partying</a> tie-less with Bono, Leonardo DiCaprio and Kevin Spacey, at a lavish party hosted by Jack Ma, the founder of internet group Alibaba and China\u2019s richest man with a $34.5bn (\u00a328.5bn) fortune. Tony Blair, who also attended the Ma party last year, is also a regular at the glitziest events.</p> <p>Travelling to Davos and finding anywhere to stay next week is very expensive, but not nearly as costly as getting an all-access pass to the schmoozing. Basic membership of the WEF and an entry ticket costs 68,000 Swiss francs (\u00a355,400), and that will only grant access to general sessions. </p> <p>To get access to all areas, corporations must pay to become <a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/about/strategic-partners\">Strategic Partners</a> of the WEF, costing SFr600,000, which allows a CEO to bring up to four colleagues, or flunkies, along with them. They must still pay SFr18,000 each for tickets. All Strategic Partners have been told that at least one of their invitees must be a woman. </p> <p>Strategic Partners are given access to all private sessions, and a car and driver with a special sticker allowing door-to-door pickup. Just 100 companies are able to become Strategic Partners; among them this year are Barclays, BT, BP, Facebook, Google and HSBC. Companies have privately complained about the cost of the exclusive access, which helped the WEF bring in record revenue of SFr228m last year, according to <a href=\"http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Annual_Report_2015-2016.pdf\">its annual report</a>. </p> <p>The most exclusive invite in town is to an uber-glamorous party thrown jointly by Russian billionaire Oleg Deripaska and British financier Nat Rothschild at the oligarch\u2019s palatial chalet, a 15-minute chauffeur-driven car ride up the mountain from Davos. In previous years, Swiss police have reportedly been called to Deripaska\u2019s home after complaints about the noise of his Cossack band. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/economics-blog/2017/jan/11/are-americans-more-ready-to-accept-inequality-donald-trump\">Are Americans more ready to accept inequality?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A former assistant to economist Nouriel Roubini has described Deripaska\u2019s parties as \u201cendless streams of the finest champagne, vodka, and Russian caviar amidst dancing Cossacks and beautiful Russian models\u201d. Sandra Navidi, who was Roubini\u2019s director of research, recalled her trip to Deripaska\u2019s party in her book Superhubs: How the Financial Elite and their Networks Rule our World.</p> <p>Many of this year\u2019s guests, who include outgoing US vice-president Joe Biden, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/11/china-xi-jinping-world-economic-forum-davos-donald-trump\">China\u2019s two richest men</a>, and London mayor Sadiq Khan, will travel on private jets to nearby airports before transferring by helicopter to escape the traffic on the approach to the picturesque town. So many jets are expected that the Swiss government has opened up D\u00fcbendorf military airfield, an 85-mile helicopter flight away, to accommodate them.</p> <p>Adam Twidell, chief executive of private jet booking service PrivateFly, said there were 1,700 private jet flights in and out of nearby airports last year, and he expected about 10% more this year. </p> <p>The increase in private jet flights \u2013 which each burn as much fuel in one hour as typical use of a car does in a year \u2013 comes as the WEF warns that climate change is the second most important global concern. In its <a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/reports/the-global-risks-report-2017\">annual global risks report</a> the WEF noted that environmental concerns were more prominent in the paper, drawn from 700 experts, than ever before.</p> <p>Twidell said a last-minute flight to Davos from London on a small private jet would cost about \u00a37,860. \u201cClients we have booked so far include business leaders, heads of state and government individuals,\u201d he said. \u201c[But] it\u2019s not just pure politicians and business people who are wanting to be seen at Davos.

      "bodyText": "The legalisation of marijuana in several US states has not curbed beer sales, according to new research, as Americans managed to find room in their social schedules for both. Analysts at investment firm Bernstein said fears that the brewing industry would be sent into chronic decline by red-eyed revellers reaching for joints instead of beers have proved unfounded. \u201cAt first sight, one would regard marijuana and alcohol in general as clear rivals and that every extra dollar spent on weed meant a dollar less on booze,\u201d they said. But rather than swapping Budweiser for bud-smoking, the legalisation of marijuana for medical or recreational purposes has in some cases corresponded with an uptick in beer consumption. In states where medical marijuana is legal, beer consumption was down 0.6% on average in the three years leading up to legalisation, but rose 0.1% in the three years after. Bernstein admitted its analysis was based on a relatively small number of states over just a few years but said: \u201cOur analysis indicates that the legalisation of medical marijuana had a positive impact on beer volume trends.\u201d It said this suggested \u201cbeer and weed are complements rather than substitutes\u201d. The picture was more mixed in states where recreational marijuana use has been legalised, but showed no signs that beer was losing out in favour of weed. The surprising results could be down to smokers having more money in their pockets to spend on beer, thanks to a fall in the price per gram of marijuana since legalisation, said Bernstein. In the state of Washington, habitual tokers paid around $10 per gram in March 2016, down from $25 in September 2014. While the budding legal weed industry faces higher costs from taxes and regulation, Bernstein said retail prices had still fallen because black-market dealers require a premium to offset the risk of imprisonment. \u201cThis would imply that previous users of marijuana now have more disposable income to spend on either more booze or more weed,\u201d they said. The report, put together by a team of 10 analysts, also highlighted anecdotal evidence suggesting a degree of overlap in the cultures surrounding marijuana and craft beer. It pointed to what has become known as the \u201cSt Patrick\u2019s Day massacre\u201d, when police raided an event staged by the Lagunitas beer brand, at which pot-smoking was commonplace. Lagunitas later produced a brand of beer commemorating the event, while its annual production figures still make reference to 420, a number commonly used as shorthand for marijuana culture. Its published beer output figures for the years 2010 to 2014 all ended in the figures 420. \u201cOne does not need to look far into popular culture to see that beer and weed cultures can be highly complementary,\u201d said Bernstein. The investment firm also highlighted several other industries that stood to benefit from marijuana legalisation, mainly companies likely to benefit from an onset of the munchies. They include Domino\u2019s Pizza, Mexican food chain Chipotle and salty snacks firm Frito Lay. California became the first state to legalise medical marijuana in 1996, but a wave of states have since followed suit. There are currently 28 states whose citizens can reach for a joint to ease their suffering and eight where its use is allowed for recreational purposes. \u2022 This article was amended on 17 January 2017 to remove a reference to Oskar Blues",

      "bodyText": "October\u2019s flash crash in the pound \u2013 when the currency nosedived by 9% against the dollar in Asian trading hours \u2013 was caused by a combination of inexperienced traders, algorithmic trading and complex trading positions, according to an official report. No single factor caused the dramatic moves which compounded the weakness of sterling after the Brexit vote, the international banking body, the Bank for International Settlements, said. Other factors such as \u201cfat finger\u201d errors and potential market abuse cannot be ruled out, but there is little, if any, hard data to substantiate them, the report added. The actions of individual participants, who are not identified, may have helped perpetuate the fall, as did the derivatives trading positions placed in the market. Some traders halted activity for as long as 30 minutes, including the black box algorithmic trading which does not rely on individuals to place orders. Some of the trades made as sterling plunged to as low as $1.1491 \u2013 down from $1.26000 \u2013 just after midnight on 7 October were later cancelled, the BIS report said. \u201cWhatever the cause of the initial selling in sterling, the market was likely to be vulnerable at that time of day to sharp moves and an associated withdrawal of liquidity,\u201d the report said. Bank of England governor Mark Carney, who asked the BIS to investigate, said it was vital that lessons were learned from the incident, which drove the pound to the lowest level since March 1985. \u201cThe report finds that there were no material losses incurred by systemic financial institutions, large volumes were transacted around the event window despite the illiquid time of day, and spillovers to other markets were very limited,\u201d said Carney. The report breaks down the event into three stages. First, just after midnight, for a period of only eight seconds (00:07:03 to 00:07:11) sterling fell from $1.2600 to 1.2494. About \u00a3252m of pound-dollar trades and \u20ac52m (\u00a342m) of euro-pound trades took place on the Reuters platform. Second, at 00:07:15, the Chicago Merchantile Exchange triggered its velocity logic mechanism, which pauses trading for 10 seconds on the futures exchange. Around this time, it become more difficult to find a price for the pound on the currency markets as there were not enough \u201cbid\u201d offers, which would have cushioned its falls. This was an \u201cunusual phenomenon\u201d, the report said. By 00:07:15 the pound was at $1.24 and \u201cgapping between trades\u201d to slide to $1.1491 at 00:07:41, a 9% fall. Those were the prices quoted by Reuters and the report noted that the currency traded lower on other trading platforms. In the third phase, the pound began to recover and was 2.2% down against the dollar by 00:20:00. The event took place amid thin trading and during a public holiday in China. which also meant big players may not have been in the market. A survey of 12 of the most active dealers showed that the lack of buy orders may have been caused by trading positions already in place. The time of day meant that traders were less experienced in sterling markets. \u201cSuch individuals were likely to have had lower risk limits and risk appetite, and may have had less expertise in the suitability of particular algorithms for the prevailing market conditions,\u201d the report said. \u201cEvidence in the UK also suggests that some traders\u2019 participation during the event may have been constrained as a result of concerns around potential market and conduct risks associated with trading in illiquid markets away from previous prevailing price levels. Both factors could have exaggerated the speed and dysfunctional nature of the price movement.\u201d As the slide coincided with a Financial Times story saying French president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande was calling for a hard Brexit, this had been cited as a potential cause. However, the report said this \u201cis only likely to have added marginal weight to the move as it did not contain new information\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "The weeks leading up to Christmas are traditionally lucrative for high street and online stores but they also reveal which retailers are faring better than others. This year most of the biggest retail names had a good festive season - with fashion chain Next the biggest loser. Next The fashion and homewares chain was the first to report how it performed over the festive period but its trading update was so dismal it dragged down shares across the retail sector. Full price sales in Next\u2019s stores dropped by a far-worse-than-expected 3.5% in the weeks leading up to Christmas even though the retailer has opened new stores. The annual winter sale \u2013 which starts at 5am each Boxing Day \u2013 was also disappointing, with sales down 7%. Directory sales, almost all online, rose by only 5%. The retailer warned of lower-than-expected profits this year and a tough 2017 as a result of rising inflation and shoppers switching away from buying clothing. But rivals did much better and analysts have started questioning whether the fashion ranges are to blame. Marks &amp; Spencer M&amp;S had its its best Christmas in six years, ending the prolonged fall in clothing sales. Like-for-like clothing sales rose 2.3% in the 13 weeks to 31 December \u2013 a big improvement on the 6% fall a year earlier. It was Steve Rowe\u2019s first Christmas as chief executive of the retailer, and he said \u201cbetter ranges, better availability and better prices\u201d helped reverse the fortunes of its clothing business. The store\u2019s Christmas TV advertising, featuring Santa\u2019s wife making an emergency present delivery, was also credited with helping sales: \u201cMrs Claus was fabulous\u201d, said Rowe. The store sold more than 5,000 copies of the red M&amp;S dress worn in the ad by Mrs Claus, played by actress Janet McTeer. Like-for-like sales within its ever-popular food division increased by 0.6%. The results were boosted by an extra five days in the trading period compared with last year. Excluding those days, clothing and food sales were still higher, by 0.8% and 0.3% respectively. John Lewis John Lewis warned staff they would get a lower bonus this year, because even though sales were ahead the group\u2019s operating profit will be lower as a result of pressure on prices and higher costs. Like-for-like sales at its department stores rose by 2.7% in the six weeks to 31 December, while Waitrose\u2019s like-for-like sales were up by 2.8%. Morrisons The supermarket enjoyed its best Christmas in seven years, after it revamped its premium ranges, opened more tills and cut fewer prices. David Potts, the Morrisons chief executive, said the UK\u2019s fourth largest supermarket had found its \u201cmojo\u201d as the retailer reported a 2.9% increase in like-for-like sales excluding fuel in the nine weeks to 1 January. Fresh fruit and vegetables, beers, wine and spirits, and Morrisons\u2019 new upmarket The Best range did well, while sales of the Nutmeg clothing range rose 30%. Sainsbury\u2019s Britain\u2019s second biggest supermarket chain surprised the City with a record Christmas and its first sales growth since March. The growth was modest - just 0.1% on a like-for-like basis excluding fuel in the 15 weeks to 7 January - but it was better than the 0.8% drop City analysts were expecting. Like-for-like sales at Argos \u2013 bought by Sainsbury\u2019s last year \u2013 rose by 4%, more than double the City forecast. Sainsbury\u2019s boss Mike Coupe said the retailer\u2019s Christmas performance reinforced the logic of its \u00a31.4bn takeover of Argos. Grocery sales were boosted in supermarkets containing Argos outlets. Tesco Britain\u2019s biggest supermarket said sales of food, clothing and toys all rose over Christmas. Sales at stores open for more than a year grew by 0.7% in the six weeks to 7 January, slightly better than the City expected. Tesco chief Dave Lewis said the improvement was driven by better customer service and product ranges. Highlights included party food, with sales up 24%, premium wine, up 20%, and Free From specialist allergy-free foods, up 18%. However, shares fell because of the retailer\u2019s disappointing international performance. Aldi Total UK sales for December at the German discount chain were up 15% on a year earlier, helped by strong demand for festive vegetables, prosecco and premium products such as \u201cspecially selected\u201d mince pies. The company said it was stealing a march on upmarket retailers Waitrose and M&amp;S. Lidl The rival German discounter\u2019s sales rose 10% in December year on year, as it opened new stores and lured shoppers with its mix of bargain prices and luxury foods. Lidl sold 200,000 lobsters over the Christmas period thanks to a savvy social media campaign, and cut the price of mini stollen, Serrano ham and silver-topped Christmas puddings. Majestic Wine Bumper sales of gin and sparkling wine helped Majestic to its \u201cbiggest ever\u201d Christmas. Gin sales jumped 55% compared with the previous year, with upmarket products such as Warner Edwards rhubarb gin and Sipsmith sloe gin performing particularly well. Sparkling wine sales rose 12%, with sales of prosecco increasing three times faster than champagne. Sales at established Majestic Wine stores (those open for more than a year), rose 7.5% in the 10 weeks to 2 January, comfortably beating expectations. Strong growth within its Naked Wines and Lay &amp; Wheeler businesses helped to drive overall group sales up 12.4%. Fortnum &amp; Mason The luxury department store group posted 16% like-for-like sales growth for the five weeks to 1 January, as shoppers stocked up on tea, hampers, caviar, smoked salmon and white truffles. Growth was underpinned by online sales, up by 22% on 2015, with Fortnum\u2019s products dispatched to 121 countries in the run-up to Christmas. The bakery department contributed a 23% increase while some tea ranges more than doubled in sales and sales of hampers, one of Fortnum\u2019s staples in the Christmas period, climbed 19%. Footfall at the flagship store in Piccadilly, central London, rose 10% as the weaker pound brought more international visitors to the capital. Debenhams Debenhams has reported better than expected Christmas trading as customers clamoured for beauty products and gifts. Like-for-like sales grew by 5% in the seven weeks to 7 January and were up 1.7% at constant exchange rates. Analysts had expected a 1% drop. The retailer has cut back on promotions to boost profit margins. Primark The discount chain\u2019s owner Associated British Foods, said trading across its business was \u201cgood\u201d in the last 16 weeks. It did not release like-for-like figures for Primark, but total sales were up 11% year on year in constant currency terms, or a chunky 22% in actual currency terms (thanks to the sharp fall in sterling since the Brexit vote). JD Sports The trainer and sports fashion retailer expects to beat City forecasts for full-year profits, sending its shares to an all-time high. Headline profit before tax and one-off items is set to exceed expectations of \u00a3200m by up to 15% thanks to bumper sales \u2013 up 10% on a like-for-like basis in the 49 weeks to 7 January. JD has overtaken Sports Direct as the UK\u2019s biggest sportswear retailer by market value, but both companies face mounting pressure over poor working conditions at their warehouses. Mothercare The baby goods retailer returned to growth in the third quarter after a surge in online sales. Total sales for the 13 weeks to 7 January rose by 0.6%, boosted by a 5.5% rise in online sales. The company said online sales now account for about 40% of all UK sales. Sales at stores open for more than a year increased by 1%. Mark Newton-Jones, chief executive, said the company had focused on improving its product range and selling goods at full price. It also better managed its stock levels, so that it entered the end-of-season sale with less stock than the previous year. B&amp;M Discounter B&amp;M celebrate a bumper Christmas trading period as cautious shoppers looked to save money. Sales rose 7.2% at the group\u2019s UK established stores in the 13 weeks to Christmas Eve, with 1.1% of that lift coming from an extra day of trading. Sales of gifts, decorations and confectionery performed particularly well according to the company, chaired by former Tesco chief executive Terry Leahy. AO World Online electricals retailer AO World achieved decent sales growth over Christmas, but struck a cautious note about the months ahead, citing \u201cthe uncertain UK economic outlook, currency impacts on supplier pricing and the possible effect on consumer demand\u201d. Total revenues in the three months to 31 December were up 12.3% year on year. Analysts at consultancy Verdict Retail said while growth has slowed considerably since last year, AO is still gaining significant market share in a sector which has been in decline for most of 2016, and remains undeterred from its expansion plans. Oxfam Sales at the charity surged to a five-year high as shoppers snapped up secondhand clothes and ethical gifts such as Fairtrade chocolate and coffee. The charity posted a 10% year-on-year rise in sales for November and December to \u00a317.2m. \u201cVirtual\u201d gifts, such as providing safe water for a small community, were popular, with a 9% rise in sales. SuperGroup The retailer behind the Superdry clothing brand enjoyed a very strong Christmas, with revenue jumping 21% in the 10 weeks to 7 January. The company, which features clothing co-designed by the actor Idris Elba, said it benefited from its store extension programme and a weaker pound, because an increasing proportion of its revenues come from outside the UK. Like-for-like sales, in stores open for more than a year increased by 14.9%. Asos The online fashion retailer aimed at twentysomethings had a bumper Christmas, with UK sales up 18% and international sales up 52% (helped by the weakness of the pound) in the four months to the end of December. Asos is now expecting sales for the full year to rise by between 25% and 30%, boosted by the strong festive trading period. Nick Beighton, the Asos chief executive, said the firm would further upgrade its systems and processes to meet the growing demand for its clothing. Hotel Chocolat Customers visited the luxury chocolatier\u2019s website and shops in greater numbers than the previous year over the Christmas period. They not only bought more items, but more higher-priced items, lifting sales by 16.2% in the 13 weeks to 25 December. Angus Thirlwell, co-founder and chief executive, said being a UK manufacturer gave the company flexibility to maintain good stock availability right up to the end of the season.",

Like-for-like sales at its department stores rose by 2.7% in the six weeks to 31 December, while Waitrose\u2019s like-for-like sales were up by 2.8%.</p> <h2>Morrisons</h2> <p>The supermarket enjoyed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/10/morrisons-enjoys-some-remarkable-christmas-cheer\">its best Christmas in seven years</a>, after it revamped its premium ranges, opened more tills and cut fewer prices.</p> <p>David Potts, the Morrisons chief executive, said the UK\u2019s fourth largest supermarket had found its \u201cmojo\u201d as the retailer reported a 2.9% increase in like-for-like sales excluding fuel in the nine weeks to 1 January. Fresh fruit and vegetables, beers, wine and spirits, and Morrisons\u2019 new upmarket The Best range did well, while sales of the Nutmeg clothing range rose 30%.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a0ae20233d9287f935acfbcc3d8b22768c388b25\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a0ae20233d9287f935acfbcc3d8b22768c388b25/0_129_3744_2246/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Sainsbury's store\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sainsbury\u2019s posted its first sales growth since March last year over Christmas.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dinendra Haria/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Sainsbury\u2019s</h2> <p>Britain\u2019s second biggest supermarket chain surprised the City with a record Christmas and its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/11/sainsburys-record-sales-christmas-week-morrisons-argos-sales\">first sales growth since March</a>. </p> <p>The growth was modest - just 0.1% on a like-for-like basis excluding fuel in the 15 weeks to 7 January - but it was better than the 0.8% drop City analysts were expecting. Like-for-like sales at Argos \u2013 bought by Sainsbury\u2019s last year \u2013 rose by 4%, more than double the City forecast. </p> <p>Sainsbury\u2019s boss Mike Coupe said the retailer\u2019s Christmas performance reinforced the logic of its \u00a31.4bn takeover of Argos. Grocery sales were boosted in supermarkets containing Argos outlets.</p> <h2>Tesco</h2> <p>Britain\u2019s biggest supermarket said sales of food, clothing and toys all rose over Christmas. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/12/tesco-sales-festive-season\">Sales at stores open for more than a year grew by 0.7% in the six weeks to 7 January</a>, slightly better than the City expected. Tesco chief Dave Lewis said the improvement was driven by better customer service and product ranges. Highlights included party food, with sales up 24%, premium wine, up 20%, and Free From specialist allergy-free foods, up 18%.</p> <p>However, shares fell because of the retailer\u2019s disappointing international performance.</p> <h2>Aldi</h2> <p>Total UK<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/10/uk-retail-sales-christmas-economy#img-1\"> sales for December at the German discount chain were up 15%</a> on a year earlier, helped by strong demand for festive vegetables, prosecco and premium products such as \u201cspecially selected\u201d mince pies. The company said it was stealing a march on upmarket retailers Waitrose and M&amp;S. </p> <h2>Lidl</h2> <p>The rival German discounter\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/11/lidls-bumper-christmas-after-shoppers-shell-out-on-lobster\">sales rose 10% in December year on year</a>, as it opened new stores and lured shoppers with its mix of bargain prices and luxury foods. Lidl sold 200,000 lobsters over the Christmas period thanks to a savvy social media campaign, and cut the price of mini stollen, Serrano ham and silver-topped Christmas puddings.</p> <h2>Majestic Wine</h2> <p>Bumper sales of gin and sparkling wine helped Majestic to its \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/10/majestic-wine-sales-up-75-over-firms-biggest-ever-christmas-period\">biggest ever\u201d Christmas</a>.

Strong growth within its Naked Wines and Lay &amp; Wheeler businesses helped to drive overall group sales up 12.4%.</p> <h2>Fortnum &amp; Mason</h2> <p>The luxury department store group posted 16% like-for-like sales growth for the five weeks to 1 January, as shoppers stocked up on tea, hampers, caviar, smoked salmon and white truffles. Growth was underpinned by online sales, up by 22% on 2015, with Fortnum\u2019s products dispatched to 121 countries in the run-up to Christmas. </p> <p>The bakery department contributed a 23% increase while some tea ranges more than doubled in sales and sales of hampers, one of Fortnum\u2019s staples in the Christmas period, climbed 19%. Footfall at the flagship store in Piccadilly, central London, rose 10% as the weaker pound brought more international visitors to the capital.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"30a7cb77691026aa7da45368526f1d5c32ebe384\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/30a7cb77691026aa7da45368526f1d5c32ebe384/0_41_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Debenhams store\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Debenhams\u2019 like-for-like Christmas sales grew by 5%.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Debenhams</h2> <p>Debenhams has reported better than expected Christmas trading as customers clamoured for beauty products and gifts.

The retailer has cut back on promotions to boost profit margins.</p> <h2>Primark</h2> <p>The discount chain\u2019s owner Associated British Foods, said trading across its business was \u201cgood\u201d in the last 16 weeks. It did not release like-for-like figures for Primark, but total sales were up 11% year on year in constant currency terms, or a chunky 22% in actual currency terms (thanks to the sharp fall in sterling since the Brexit vote).</p> <h2>JD Sports<br></h2> <p>The trainer and sports fashion retailer expects to beat City forecasts for full-year profits, sending its shares to an all-time high. Headline profit before tax and one-off items is set to exceed expectations of \u00a3200m by up to 15% thanks to bumper sales \u2013 up 10% on a like-for-like basis in the 49 weeks to 7 January. JD has overtaken Sports Direct as the UK\u2019s biggest sportswear retailer by market value, but both companies <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/15/jd-sports-warehouse-channel-4-kingsway-rochdale\">face mounting pressure over poor working conditions at their warehouses</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"16ada98dca68dc0431d6d388b2837f33ec879062\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/16ada98dca68dc0431d6d388b2837f33ec879062/0_271_2600_1560/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mothercare returned to growth in the third quarter.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mothercare returned to growth in the third quarter.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Faith/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Mothercare</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/mothercare\">The baby goods retailer</a> returned to growth in the third quarter after a surge in online sales.

Sales at stores open for more than a year increased by 1%.</p> <p>Mark Newton-Jones, chief executive, said the company had focused on improving its product range and selling goods at full price. It also better managed its stock levels, so that it entered the end-of-season sale with less stock than the previous year.</p> <h2>B&amp;M</h2> <p>Discounter B&amp;M celebrate a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/04/retailer-b-and-m-christmas-trading-period-strongest-quarter-since-2013\">bumper Christmas trading period</a> as cautious shoppers looked to save money. Sales rose 7.2% at the group\u2019s UK established stores in the 13 weeks to Christmas Eve, with 1.1% of that lift coming from an extra day of trading. Sales of gifts, decorations and confectionery performed particularly well according to the company, chaired by former Tesco chief executive Terry Leahy.</p> <h2>AO World<br></h2> <p>Online electricals retailer AO World achieved decent sales growth over Christmas, but struck a cautious note about the months ahead, citing \u201cthe uncertain UK economic outlook, currency impacts on supplier pricing and the possible effect on consumer demand\u201d.</p> <p>Total revenues in the three months to 31 December were up 12.3% year on year. Analysts at consultancy Verdict Retail said while growth has slowed considerably since last year, AO is still gaining significant market share in a sector which has been in decline for most of 2016, and remains undeterred from its expansion plans.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c22be83c20fd4cbb1dbae9f17da9da478cf31a7e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c22be83c20fd4cbb1dbae9f17da9da478cf31a7e/0_61_3504_2102/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Oxfam sign\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Oxfam posted a 10% year-on-year rise in sales for November and December.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tim Ockenden/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Oxfam</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/jan/12/ethical-gift--oxfam-highest-sales-five-years\">Sales at the charity surged to a five-year high</a> as shoppers snapped up secondhand clothes and ethical gifts such as Fairtrade chocolate and coffee.

The company, which features <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/mar/26/superdry-signs-up-idris-elba\">clothing co-designed by the actor Idris Elba,</a> said it benefited from its store extension programme and a weaker pound, because an increasing proportion of its revenues come from outside the UK. Like-for-like sales, in stores open for more than a year increased by 14.9%.</p> <h2>Asos</h2> <p>The online fashion retailer aimed at twentysomethings had a bumper Christmas, with UK sales up 18% and international sales up 52% (helped by the weakness of the pound) in the four months to the end of December. <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-asos-results-idUKKBN14W0QX\">Asos is now expecting sales for the full year to rise by between 25% and 30%</a>, boosted by the strong festive trading period. </p> <p>Nick Beighton, the Asos chief executive, said the firm would further upgrade its systems and processes to meet the growing demand for its clothing.</p> <h2>Hotel Chocolat</h2> <p>Customers visited the luxury chocolatier\u2019s website and shops in greater numbers than the previous year over the Christmas period. They not only bought more items, but more higher-priced items, lifting sales by 16.2% in the 13 weeks to 25 December. <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/apr/02/hotel-chocolat-boss-easter-angus-thirlwell-interview\">Angus Thirlwell, co-founder and chief executive</a>, said being a UK manufacturer gave the company flexibility to maintain good stock availability right up to the end of the season. </p>",
