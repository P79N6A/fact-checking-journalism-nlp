      "standfirst": "Morrisons chief executive sees convenience stores and online as future as critics say supermarket chain slow to&nbsp;modernise", 
      "body": "<p>Morrisons will be able to compete on equal terms with its rivals for the first time, its chief executive, Dalton Philips, said as he revealed the supermarket chain may open up to 300 convenience stores over the next three years.</p> <p>He also defended his decision to sign up to a \u00a3216m 25-year deal with Ocado to use the online grocer's systems to set up a home delivery website later this year, and said he believed the online business would make a profit within four years.</p> <p>\"It took our competitors years to build an online capacity of \u00a3500m. We've done it at a stroke. Looking at our competitors it appears to take a decade to hit profitability. We'll achieve it in four years.</p> <p>\"By 2015 when all this is finished we will be a fully integrated multichannel business. We will be able to compete on a level playing field for the first time.\"</p> <p>Morrison's 500 stores will undergo a \u00a3300m technology overhaul, after Philips revealed stock was still counted manually, with staff filling out papers before inputting the data into computers.</p> <p>Earlier this year, the company said it would make 700 back office staff redundant as it introduced cash counting machines, having previously counted takings by hand. But he revealed 80% of those workers have been redeployed elsewhere within the business.</p> <p>Philips refused to say how many staff could end up losing their jobs because of the latest upgrades, but said he hoped many could be redeployed. He added: \"We've been running a 21st-century business with 20th-century technology.\"</p> <p>The company has been criticised in the past for being too slow to move into the convenience store market and online, the two fastest-growing areas of retail.</p> <p>On Wednesday, Sainsbury's revealed at its annual general meeting that the number of convenience stores it had open would exceed supermarkets for the first&#xa0;time.</p> <p>Morrisons plans to open 100 convenience stores by the end of the year, having bought up several former HMV, Jessops and Blockbuster sites. Philips said he would look at other companies that go bust for future expansion.</p> <p>The new stores will offer 50% fresh products, which the company said will match the prices in their supermarkets, although other groceries would cost&#xa0;more.</p> <p>Philips, who joined three years ago, has been accused of not acting fast enough to secure the future of Morrisons, which has seen its market share fall in the last year. But he remained defiant, claiming he had answered his critics. \"And I feel good about it,\" he said.</p> <p>Although Philips refused to blame his predecessor Marc Bolland \u2013 now in charge of Marks &amp; Spencer \u2013 for failing to introduce new technology or an online business when rivals were forging ahead with their own, he agreed Morrisons had fallen far behind.</p> <p>\"When I arrived there were no plans for online, no plans for convenience and systems that were from the last century. Three years on we are putting in 21st-century systems and we are very aggressive on our convenience business.</p> <p>\"Defying gravity becomes a lot harder. We could have done nothing and let our business go into slow but inevitable decline.\"</p> <p>The new convenience stores will be mainly focused in the south-east, an area where Morrisons has little market penetration, and will open new central London sites.</p> <p>The online business is set to launch in January, after localised trials are expected to be rolled out in the autumn. But the company still needs to decide where its spoke delivery sites will be, particularly around London, for deliveries from the distribution centre in the north of&#xa0;England.</p> <p>Morrisons will become the last of the big four supermarkets to enter a \u00a35.6bn-a-year online market that us expected to double in size by 2017.</p> <p>Clive Black, retail analyst at Shore Capital, said he thought moving into online and convenience stores was long overdue for Morrisons, but cautioned the supermarket not to expand too quickly.</p> <p>\"The key thing is to get the right locations,\" he said. \"We would have some reservations about the quality of some of the stores they've chosen. We would like them to take their time in terms of site evaluation. Tesco and Sainsbury's can't open everywhere, so there's space to enter the&#xa0;market.\"</p> <p>Philips also called on the government to review business rates, adding his name to a long list of retailers concerned that high rates could destroy the high street.</p> <p>He said: \"Business rates are too high. If they continue to rise they will put more shops out of business. We want a thriving high street and the government has to look at how business rates are calculated.\"</p> <p>His suggestion that an online tax may be a solution is at odds with his business partners Ocado. Its chief executive, Tim Steiner, said high street retailers needed to \"shut more shops and stop moaning\".</p>",

He also defended his decision to sign up to a \u00a3216m 25-year deal with Ocado to use the online grocer's systems to set up a home delivery website later this year, and said he believed the online business would make a profit within four years. \"It took our competitors years to build an online capacity of \u00a3500m. We've done it at a stroke. Looking at our competitors it appears to take a decade to hit profitability. We'll achieve it in four years. \"By 2015 when all this is finished we will be a fully integrated multichannel business. We will be able to compete on a level playing field for the first time.\" Morrison's 500 stores will undergo a \u00a3300m technology overhaul, after Philips revealed stock was still counted manually, with staff filling out papers before inputting the data into computers. Earlier this year, the company said it would make 700 back office staff redundant as it introduced cash counting machines, having previously counted takings by hand. But he revealed 80% of those workers have been redeployed elsewhere within the business. Philips refused to say how many staff could end up losing their jobs because of the latest upgrades, but said he hoped many could be redeployed. He added: \"We've been running a 21st-century business with 20th-century technology.\" The company has been criticised in the past for being too slow to move into the convenience store market and online, the two fastest-growing areas of retail. On Wednesday, Sainsbury's revealed at its annual general meeting that the number of convenience stores it had open would exceed supermarkets for the first time. Morrisons plans to open 100 convenience stores by the end of the year, having bought up several former HMV, Jessops and Blockbuster sites. Philips said he would look at other companies that go bust for future expansion. The new stores will offer 50% fresh products, which the company said will match the prices in their supermarkets, although other groceries would cost more. Philips, who joined three years ago, has been accused of not acting fast enough to secure the future of Morrisons, which has seen its market share fall in the last year. But he remained defiant, claiming he had answered his critics. \"And I feel good about it,\" he said. Although Philips refused to blame his predecessor Marc Bolland \u2013 now in charge of Marks &amp; Spencer \u2013 for failing to introduce new technology or an online business when rivals were forging ahead with their own, he agreed Morrisons had fallen far behind. \"When I arrived there were no plans for online, no plans for convenience and systems that were from the last century. Three years on we are putting in 21st-century systems and we are very aggressive on our convenience business. \"Defying gravity becomes a lot harder. We could have done nothing and let our business go into slow but inevitable decline.\" The new convenience stores will be mainly focused in the south-east, an area where Morrisons has little market penetration, and will open new central London sites. The online business is set to launch in January, after localised trials are expected to be rolled out in the autumn. But the company still needs to decide where its spoke delivery sites will be, particularly around London, for deliveries from the distribution centre in the north of England. Morrisons will become the last of the big four supermarkets to enter a \u00a35.6bn-a-year online market that us expected to double in size by 2017. Clive Black, retail analyst at Shore Capital, said he thought moving into online and convenience stores was long overdue for Morrisons, but cautioned the supermarket not to expand too quickly. \"The key thing is to get the right locations,\" he said. \"We would have some reservations about the quality of some of the stores they've chosen. We would like them to take their time in terms of site evaluation. Tesco and Sainsbury's can't open everywhere, so there's space to enter the market.\" Philips also called on the government to review business rates, adding his name to a long list of retailers concerned that high rates could destroy the high street. He said: \"Business rates are too high. If they continue to rise they will put more shops out of business. We want a thriving high street and the government has to look at how business rates are calculated.\" His suggestion that an online tax may be a solution is at odds with his business partners Ocado. Its chief executive, Tim Steiner, said high street retailers needed to \"shut more shops and stop moaning\".",

      "bodyText": "The US stock market was on course to reach a new peak on Thursday after the Federal Reserve pledged to keep interest rates low until unemployment falls nearer to levels last seen before the banking crash. On a day when more Americans than expected claimed unemployment benefits, the central bank said the economy was underperforming and still needed very low rates to stay on course for recovery. In morning trading in New York the Dow Jones climbed to 15423, above its all-time closing high of 15409, reached in May this year. The S&amp;P 500 also climbed above its closing record to reach 1,668, following in the footsteps of the FTSE 100, which finished the day 33 points higher at 6539. The Fed statement was widely interpreted as a hardening of views in its Washington headquarters against pressure from investors and many rightwing politicians in favour raising interest rates. By a majority vote, the Fed open markets committee (FOMC) said: \"To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the committee expects that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the asset purchase programme ends and the economic recovery strengthens.\" The statement ended a month of uncertainty following a June question-and-answer session when Fed chairman Ben Bernanke had appeared to indicate that monetary easing was due to be scaled back before the end of the year. Bernanke's earlier remarks sent the FTSE 100 into freefall and knocked more than 800 points off the index. Reassuring speeches by Fed staff since then stabilised the atmosphere but failed to reverse the stock market trend significantly. Several policymakers on Capitol Hill have voiced fears that the Fed's quantitative easing (QE) programme, which involves the central bank creating $1tn (\u00a3660bn) a year of new money, will encourage investments in developing nation currencies, property and other risky assets. Critics of the Fed's strategy, which has kept interest rates at 0.25% for four years and caused purchase of more than $3tn of government bonds, have also argued the economy is strong enough to withstand a return to \"normal\" interest rates. Concerns that Tokyo's commitment to pump huge amounts of yen into Japanese economy to beat deflation was unravelling also fuelled panic on the international money markets. But in an apparent co-ordinated move, the Bank of Japan declared on Thursday that its own version of quantitative easing was improving economic growth and would be expanded over the coming months. BOJ governor Haruhiko Kuroda said while overseas economies were weaker than expected that would be offset by robust domestic consumer spending and a pickup in capital expenditure. He was confident consumer and business demand will increase, pushing inflation towards its 2% target in roughly two years. The Shanghai composite index reacted to the FOMC's comments with a 3.2% rise, its strongest gain since January.

Investors in China feared a collapse in demand for Chinese exports should the Fed choke of the US recovery with higher interest rates. Last week the new governor of the Bank of England Mark Carney joined European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi in issuing statements that interest rates would remain low despite the early signs of economic recovery. Carney is due to review the BoE's strategy for communicating to the markets how and when it intends to raise rates. It is expected he will persuade the nine-member monetary policy committee to adopt a Fed-style formula for issuing forward guidance, but it is not known if the UK will mimic trying a rise in interest rates to a large fall in unemployment. The Fed said it would keep rates low until unemployment fell to 6.5% from its current 7.6% and possibly longer depending on the level of inflation and growth. But Bernanke failed to persuade all FOMC members to sign the statement. Esther George said she was concerned continued high levels of monetary easing \"increased the risks of future economic and financial imbalances and, over time, could cause an increase in long-term inflation expectations\".

He missed his own deadline and now his \"message\" has been ignored by the board and fellow shareholders. What's he waiting for? Hasn't he noticed that easyJet's share price is soaring, up 50% since his January blast? Well, one problem is that the Haji-Ioannou family stake is worth almost \u00a32bn these days. That's a chunky holding. But it's far from impossible to sell in an orderly fashion - a dispatch in a few bundles would do the trick given the market's current appetite for easyJet shares. Sir Stelios would then able to depart while claiming \u2013 fairly \u2013 that his long campaign of activism has benefited all shareholders.

Indeed, he said in January that he would look to off-load a few ahead of any order to send \"a clear message\" to the board. He missed his own deadline and now his \"message\" has been ignored by the board and fellow shareholders. What's he waiting for? Hasn't he noticed that easyJet's share price is soaring, up 50% since his January blast?</p> <p>Well, one problem is that the Haji-Ioannou family stake is worth almost \u00a32bn these days. That's a chunky holding. But it's far from impossible to sell in an orderly fashion - a dispatch in a few bundles would do the trick given the market's current appetite for easyJet shares.</p> <p>Sir Stelios would then able to depart while claiming \u2013 fairly \u2013 that his long campaign of activism has benefited all shareholders. He was instrumental in pushing the importance of dividends and returns on capital, for example. Alternatively, January's statement was bluster \u2013 he's a hard man to read.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Over on Wall Street, shares are also enjoying a Bernanke pick-me-up. The Dow Jones industrial average is up 137 points, or 0.9%, at 15428. Finish there and it'll be a new record closing high for the Dow. And European readers can tune in tomorrow morning to see if it made it! But with the markets closed, and the eurozone looking quiet, I'm shutting up for the day. Good night, and thanks. GW Another example of industrial action in Greece - medical staff have called two one-day strikes for later this month. The protest is against the government's plan to move 2,500 health sector workers into the 'mobility scheme' -- where they will receive lower wages and could be dismissed if they don't take another job. Kathimerini has more details: State hospitals and the ambulance service will be operating on a reduced staff next Tuesday after the union representing hospital employees and the National First Aid Center (EKAB) called a 24-hour walkout to coincide with a general strike on that day and a second 24-hour walkout the following Wednesday, July 24. As reported at 2.32pm, police officers and teachers both held protest rallies in Athens today - against the mobility scheme. The government, though, has introduced legislation to bring the programme into law, which should be voted on next week. European stock markets have closed at their highest level since early June, as the Bernanke Bounce lasted until the closing bell. And with Wall Street still buoyant, it's possible that the US indices will close at new record highs late tonight. Mining stocks helped to push the FTSEurofirst to a five week high. The prospect of the Fed 'tapering' its bond purchases more slowly \u2013 ie, stimulating the US economy more vigorously for longer \u2013 cheered the City. \u2022 FTSE 100: up 38 points at 6543, +0.58% \u2022 German DAX: up 92 points at 8158, + 1.1% \u2022 French CAC: up 28 points at 3868, +0.75% \u2022 Spanish IBEX: up 35 points at 8030, +0.45% \u2022 Italian FTSE MIB: flat David Jones, chief market strategist at IG, explains: The US Federal Reserve\u2019s chairman Ben Bernanke did a stellar job in taming the recent downside bias that came from the volatility in equity markets. The mere phrase that we would see \u2018a highly accommodative policy\u2019 for the foreseeable future gave relief to investors, and was sufficient to charge risk sentiment and send indices rocketing up sharply. However, the Portuguse stock market fell by 2%, hit by political instability fears after its president called for all political parties to create a \"national salvation\" deal (details here). Bank shares led the fallers, with Banco Internacional do Funchal tumbling by 13%. Here's a video clip of the protests in the Portuguese parliament this afternoon -- showing a group of demonstrators chanting and clapping, and throwing paper (i think) as they urged MPs to resign: Via Economico Reports of protests in the Portuguese parliament this afternoon, via local journalist Jos\u00e9 Miguel Sardo. Another sign of the tension in Lisbon, after the Portuguese president called for parties to work together to keep the country afloat (see 12.26pm). Ben Bernanke's comments last night has sent US government bond prices up, reversing the recent rise in Treasury yields, as bond traders anticipate the Fed's bond-buying programme lasting longer. The yield on US 10-year bonds has dropped to 2.608%, from 2.68% last night. That's still much higher than 1.4% reached a year ago, but pretty low in historical terms. German and UK sovereign debt has also strengthened. And Ashot Tsharakyan, Economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics, says that shows why we should all watch events in the US: European investors should follow the U.S. economy closely, and also that U.S. policymakers should understand that what they say affects Europe. Clear central bank communication, well in advance of any change in policy, will be critical. Although the U.S. economy is strengthening, the euro zone remains fragile. Rising sovereign bond yields pose a risk to the stability of the global financial system and to the euro zone\u2019s highly indebted economies, which are plagued by high unemployment, tight credit, and fiscal austerity. According to the Bank for International Settlements a rise of 3 percentage points in bond yields would cost U.S. investors more than $1 trillion, equal to 8% of GDP. This is large, but a similar rise would be much more damaging around the world, costing creditors of France, Italy, Japan and the U.K. the equivalent of 15% to 35% of those countries' GDP. Greek prime minister Antonis Samaras will get the red carpet treatment in Washington next month, when he visits President Obama. The visit, announced today, will see the two leaders discuss \"Greek-US defense cooperation, the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, regional cooperation, mutual counterterrorism efforts\". The two men will also discuss development in North Africa and Syria, and the division of Cyprus, according to the White House. No mention of the debt crisis -- a sign of how the prospect of Greece quitting the eurozone has faded from the agenda. Assoiciated Press sums up the early action on Wall Street: The stock market is rising to record highs after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said the central bank would continue to support the U.S. economy. The Dow Jones industrial average was up 151 points, or 1 percent, to 15,443 after the first few minutes of trading Thursday. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index rose 17 points, also 1 percent, to 1,670. The early advance put the Dow and S&amp;P above their previous record closes set in May. All 10 industry groups in the S&amp;P 500 rose. Investors also bought bonds after being reassured that the Fed was not in a hurry to pull back on its huge bond-buying program. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.59 percent from 2.63 percent late Wednesday. US shares have jumped at the start of trading in Wall Street. Both the Dow Jones index and the S&amp;P 500 have risen around 1% to levels above their record closing points. Clearly Ben Bernanke's comments last night about maintaining highly accomodative monetary polcy have been well received by US traders, as well as those in Europe (where the FTSE 100 is up 0.5%, and the German DAX is 1.2% higher). Bernanke's dovish words must have shaken any bearish traders.... It's another day of protests in central Athens, as opposition to the government's civil service job cuts plans refuses to be subdued. Hundreds of municipal police officers drove through the capital on motor bikes, unhappy about plans to put thousands of their number into the mobility pool (the first stage towards redundancy): A group of teachers also held a protest rally in front of the Greek Parliament, holding banners with slogans such as \"It's enough\" and \"No to demolition of public education\" And a new opinion poll has found little public support for the newly reshuffled government in Athens, even within supporters of the two parties in the coalition. According to the poll, only 23% of Greeks have a positive view of the recent government reshuffle the poll found. Forty seven percent of New Democracy supporters saw the shake-up in a positive light, compared to 41% among Pasok voters. More here on eKathimerini: Ruling conservatives ahead of leftist opposition, poll shows The share rally in London has turned sour for two outsourcing companies, G4S and Serco, who are accused of overcharging the UK government by tens of millions of pounds on a contract for tagging offenders Serco and G4S are leading the FTSE 100 fallers after the justice secretary, Chris Grayling, called in the Serious Fraud Squad. He told MPs that both companies had charged for monitoring people who were back in prison and had had their tags removed, people who had left the UK, and some who had never been tagged. And that wasn't the worst of it, as home affairs editor Alan Travis reports: \"There are a small number of cases where charging continued for a period when the subject was known to have died,\" the justice secretary told MPs. Serco shares have now tumbled 6.3%, while G4S has shed over 3%. The number of Americans filing new jobs claims has risen to a two month high, according to data just released. Last week's US jobless new claims total came in at 360,000, an increase on the 344,000 in the previous seven days, and dashing hopes that it would drop to 340,000. However, that figure still suggests the US labour market is slowly healing - one of the key measures that Ben Bernanke and the Federal Reserve will use when deciding when to slow its stimulus measures. Some lunchtime fun...the Bank of England has launched a new application that lets you explore its corridors and vaults from the comfort of your own smartphone or computer. My colleague Maev Kennedy reports: A panoramic tour on the app shows the stacks of shining gold bars, each weighing around 13kg and valued at about \u00a3350,000 \u2013 the price of gold fluctuates constantly and is fixed twice a day. The vaults hold about 400,000 gold bars, almost all of which are owned by other banks. A small percentage belongs to the government and to the bank itself \u2013 including two Roman gold bars on display in the bank's museum.

Wall Street traders predict that the main stock indices will follow Europe's lead by rising by around 1% when trading begins in 90 minutes time - details here. In Athens, municipal policewomen have held a protest outside the headquarters of the co-ruling New Democracy party, in the latest demonstration against planned public sector job cuts: Portugal appears to be gripped by political instability, after the country's president called for all parties to work together to guide it out of its bailout programme. Last night, An\u00edbal Cavaco Silva said a \u201cnational salvation\u201d deal between the coalition government and the opposition socialist party was needed. The time has come for politicians to assume their responsibilities. The decisions taken in the next few days will affect Portugal\u2019s future in the year ahead. Cavaco Silva added that a deal was needed to guarantee Portugal's governability and debt sustainability. This has caused surprise in Portugal, as the president was expected to simply endorse the reshuffled government hammered out between prime minister Pedro Passos Coelho and coalition partner Paulo Portas. Portuguese media are alarmed. The daily Publico wrote in an editorial that: The president of the republic decided to overcome the political stalemate between the parties in the ruling coalition by adding another problem to the one that already existed. He decided to take power. A former socialist minister, Pedro Silva Pereira, has warned that Cavaco Silva has put the government's future in doubt. Here's Reuters take: Portugal political crisis deepens: Portugal's political crisis deepened on Thursday after the president rejected a plan to heal a government rift and critics accused him of igniting a \"time bomb\" by calling for early elections next year. And in the financial markets, Portuguese sovereign debt is weakening in value, pushing up the yield on its 10-year bonds to 6.993%, up from 6.89% last night). At noon in the City, the big three European stock markets remain higher after an upbeat morning following Ben Bernanke suggested last night that the Federal Reserve could maintain its stimulus package for longer than thought (see opening post for the details). This pushed the main index of European shares up to a five-week high. \u2022 FTSE 100: up 40 points at 6545, +0.6% \u2022 German DAX: up 72 points at 8138, +0.9% \u2022 French CAC: up 18 points at 3859, + 0.5% \u2022 Spanish IBEX: up 16 points at 8011, +0.2% \u2022 Italian FTSE MIB: up 25 points at 15700, +.15% The Bernanke effect is also being felt in the commodities market, with gold at a two week high ($1,285 per ounce). Oil has hit a three-month high this morning, with a barrel of Brent crude trading at $108.92. Matt Basi, head of UK sales trading at CMC Markets UK, explains that Bernanke has been a major impact on the stock markets: After June\u2019s sell off in risk assets was attributed to seemingly hawkish comments from the Fed Chairman last month, the July rally has built further momentum this morning on the back of a much softer statement from the Fed Chairman after markets closed last night. This renewed dovishness has apparently been the result of concerns over the true state of the US labour market, though with half of the FOMC still arguing for tapering before the year end, the longevity of the asset purchase programme remains unclear. (following last night's Fed minutes - details here) In the bond markets, Italy has succeeded in selling almost \u20ac5bn of government debt despite being downgraded by Standard &amp; Poor's on Tuesday night. However, there appeared to be lacklustre demand \u2013 with the bid-to-cover ratios (the ratio of demand to the amount of debt on the table) showing the Italian Treasury accepted most of the offers. Here's the key details: \u2022 \u20ac3.38bn of three-year bonds sold: yield (or interest rate) of 2.33%, down from 2.38%. Bid-to-cover ratio of 1.34 \u2022 \u20ac1.461bn of 30-year bonds at an average yield of 5.19%, up from 4.985%. Bid-to-cover ratio of 1.3 There was chatter in the markets that the auction was quite slow \u2013 suggesting traders may be more nervous of Italian debt since the downgrade. The news yesterday that Silvio Berlusconi's final appeal against a jail term and ban from public office will be heard on 30 July may also be a factor, with speculation that the veteran politician could pull support for Italy's coalition government if the hearing goes against him. Another key fact about the Greek labour market (see 10.16am) is that nearly two-thirds of unemployed people have been out of work for at least a year, economist Angelos Tsakanikas at the IOBE think tank explained. And here's a graph showing how the ratio between those in work, and not, has been steadily falling over the last two years - from 1.15 to 0.8%. Here's the ELSTAT statement on Greek unemployment in Greek and also in English The unemployment rate in Greece has climbed to a new record high of 26.9%, while the youth jobless rate is now a truly dire 57.5%. Data just released by ELSTAT showed that there was no end to the Greek jobless crisis in Aprii. The official unemployment rate rose from 26.8% in March, and is significantly higher than the 23.1% recorded in April 2012. The data shows that there are now 3,636,042 people of working age employed in Greece, compared to 1,337,621 officially unemployed. A further 3,337,051 are classed as 'inactive' (ie, not in work or looking for a job). Among women, the unemployment rate is now 30%, compared to 24.2% for men. Jens Weidmann \u2013 the head of the Bundesbank and Germany's man on the ECB governing council \u2013 has railed against the current dovishness gripping the central bank world. Weidmann is to tell an audience in Munich that the ECB has not \"tied itself to the mast\" with its new forward guidance on interest rates. Interesting timing, given the details in the ECB monthly report (see 9.40am). Reuters has the story: Weidmann, the hawkish chief of Germany's Bundesbank, said the ECB's commitment last week to keep its interest rates at record lows - or even cut them further - was justified by a subdued inflation outlook and a weak economic environment. But he added that the ECB's monetary policy stance was conditional on economic developments.\"It is not an absolute advanced commitment of the interest rate path,\" he said in the text of a speech for delivery in Munich. \"The ECB Council has not, like Odysseus simply tied itself to the mast.\" We're all for classical references at Guardian Towers, but it seems like a slightly curious analogy. After all, if Odysseus hadn't been restrained he would have been lured to his doom by those alluring Sirens. Presumably if Weidmann had the ship's wheel, they wouldn't have taken such a reckless course in the first place? The European Central Bank has released its monthly bulletin, and it includes more details of the ECB's deliberations at last Thursday's governing council meeting. The report (online here as a pdf) expands, a little, on its unprecedented move into forward guidance, by guiding that interest rates would remain at \"present or lower levels for an extended period of time\". Today's report states: The extended period of time over which the Governing Council currently expects the key ECB interest rates to remain at present or lower levels is a flexible horizon which does not pre-specify an end-date but is conditional on the Governing Council\u2019s assessment of the economic fundamentals that determine underlying inflation. So the ECB is unwilling to commit to a target or deadline, but still pinning its forward guidance to its primary mandate of price stability. The report also shows that further rate cuts, from the current record lows, are certainly being considered. The ECB states that the guidance was released \"before exhausting the scope for further reductions in the key ECB interest rates\". Frederik Ducrozet of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole spies a hint that the ECB won't, or can't, fix the credit squeeze in the eurozone periphery on its own. Luxembourg, traditionally one of the more peaceful areas of the eurozone, is gripped by political crisis today after a spy scandal ended prime minister Jean-Claude Juncker's long reign. Juncker, who played a key role in the eurozone crisis as head of the eurogroup of finance ministers, is expected to tender his resignation today after 18 years. He has been brought down by revelations that Luxembourg's intelligence agency had been illicitely bugging politicians. Juncker is due to meet with his cabinet now, before meeting with the country's Grand Duke to propose 'snap elections'. Juncker was brought down by his coalition partners, the Socialists group, which said he should take \"full political responsibility\" for the scandal. An official report found that the country's SREL security agency had illegally monitored top politicians, purchased cars for private use and made payments to local officials. Juncker had argued that he had been focused on more important issues, saying: The intelligence service was not my top priority. Moreover, I hope Luxembourg will never have a prime minister who sees SREL as [their] priority. The dollar has lost ground generally since Bernanke's comments and the release of the minutes from the Federal Reserve's last meeting*. The pound is now up at $1.508, from as low as $1.486 at one point yesterday. That takes sterling back close to its levels before the Bank of England declared that UK interest rates will remain low for longer than the City expected. And the euro's back above $1.30, a level it slid through last week after European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi said eurozone rates would remain at record lows for an 'extended period'. * - Here's our story about the minutes: Fed members agree job market must improve before bond buys slow While Asia, the main Chinese stock market jumped 3% and the Hong Kong Hang Seng is up 2.4%. All mainly on the news that the US economy isn't healthy enough to cope without 'highly accomodative' monetary policy.... Mining stocks are the big gainers in London on the prospect of America's quantitative easing programme running for longer, along with Associated British Foods (owners of the Primark fashion chain) which released strong results this morning: European shares have leapt ahead in the first couple of minutes of trading, as investors scramble to react to Ben Bernanke's comments last night (see 7.53am). In London the FTSE 100 rose by 77 points to 6580, up 1.2%. The French, German, Italian and Spanish markets are showing similar gains. Chris Weston of IG sums up the meat of the Bernanke speech thus: Price action in every asset class came alive on Ben Bernanke\u2019s narrative; while his comments were clearly dovish, the key fact that he stipulated was that the Fed funds rate would not automatically rise when (and of course if) US joblessness hits 6.5%, and this has firmly dictated to the market that the 6.5% level is a threshold, not a trigger. In other words, the punchbowl of easy money won't run dry soon.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the eurozone crisis, the global economy and the financial world. It's going to be a lively day in the markets after Federal Reserve chair Ben Bernanke declared last night that the days of ultra-loose monetary policy are far from over. Shares are rallying in Asia, and big gains are expected in Europe after a suprisingly dovish performance from Bernanke. The Fed chair implied that he and his colleagues are some way from ending the huge bond-buying programme that is pumping $85bn per month into the US economy. The dollar tumbled after Bernanke suggested that the true rate of US joblessness was higher than shown by the official figures, and pointed out that inflation remained As Bernanke put it: Highly accommodative monetary policy for the foreseeable future is what's needed. Bernanke said policy makers are \"somewhat optimistic\" about the US economy, but suggested that the Fed could take further action if needed: If financial conditions were to tighten to the extent that they jeopardized the achievement of our inflation and employment objectives, then we would have to push back against that. Bernanke's comments were surprising as two weeks ago, after the last Fed meeting, he has spoken of slowing the Fed's quantitative easing programme later this year, and ending it by the summer of 2014. Minutes from that meeting, also released yesterday, showed that Fed officials were split over the issue, with some members wanting more reassurance that America's labour market was healing before turning down the tap of easy money. And the prospect of yet more simulus measures has been greeted with a predictable cheer in the financial world -- the Chinese market was up 4% in late trading).And the dollar has been tumbling against other currencies (round-up to follow) Spread betters expect European shares to rally too: But it's a less cheerful picture in the euro area today, where political instability is the theme of the day. Even in Luxembourg, where veteran prime minister Jean Claude Juncker is expected to formally resign today over a spying scandal. I'll be tracking all the action in the markets and the euro area for the next few hours, as usual....",

      "bodyText": "SuperGroup, the retailer behind street fashion brand Superdry, hailed a return to form as it reported a 22% surge in pre-tax profits. Revenues were up 15% to \u00a3360m for the year to April, as the retailer accelerated its international expansion with new outlets in France, Spain, Denmark, India and Lebanon. Floor space in the UK and Europe was increased by 13.8% to reach 536,000 square feet, helped by the opening of six stores in the UK, including a flagship 16,000 sq ft store in the Trinity shopping centre in Leeds. The group rebranded its 20 Cult stores as Superdry last year, to capitalise on the growing popularity of the brand, whose fans include David Beckham and Pippa Middleton. The group plans to extend its floor space in the UK and Europe by a further 80,000-100,000 sq ft in 2014. The group has also been investing in its internet business, with 10 new local language sites including Italian and Norwegian. Online sales rose by 28% and are now worth 11% of the group's revenues, as customers in more than 100 countries log on to order the retailer's trademark hooded sweatshirts and Japanese-character embossed rucksacks. Thursday's financial report will be welcomed by investors after a turbulent time in 2011-12, when the group issued a string of profit warnings following IT problems and an incorrect forecast of demand for its goods. Dan Coen at advisory firm Zolfo Cooper said the retailer had gone a long way to prove cautious investors wrong. \"With ambitious international expansion plans, as well as increasing its online offering overseas, the retailer's success does not look like it will be cooling off anytime soon.\" Julian Dunkerton, the chief executive of SuperGroup and creator of the Superdry brand, said the financial performance was a return to form. He praised the progress in womenswear and said he was confident of \"significant opportunities for growth across all channels and geographies\". He added: \"I am pleased by the performance of 2013 ranges and the early reaction to 2014 product and remain confident in the prospects for the group.\" Primark also shared in the good news on the high street, as it reported a 22% increase in total sales over the 40 weeks until mid-June. The budget fashion chain's performance helped its parent company, Associated British Foods, to a 9% increase in revenues.",

The group rebranded its 20 Cult stores as Superdry last year, to capitalise on the growing popularity of the brand, whose fans include David Beckham and Pippa Middleton.

Looking at the national rate of unemployment minus each state goes some way to displaying the different speeds of the economy around the nation.
