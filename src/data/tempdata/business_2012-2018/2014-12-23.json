      "bodyText": "George Osborne\u2019s hopes of using a strengthening economy as the springboard for victory in the general election next May have been dealt a double blow with news of weaker growth during 2013 and 2014 and one of the biggest current account deficits in the UK\u2019s history. With Britain\u2019s recovery from its worst ever recession set to dominate a tightly fought vote next spring, Labour seized on official figures showing it was unlikely that national output would expand this year by the 3% envisaged by the chancellor in the autumn statement. Osborne has claimed in recent weeks that a combination of stronger growth, falling unemployment and a smaller budget deficit have shown that the government\u2019s plan is working and that sticking to the current course is essential. But the Office for National Statistics said the economy\u2019s performance through much of 2013 and 2014 had been less impressive than was first thought. It left growth unchanged at 0.7% in the third quarter of 2014, but revised down its estimates for the five previous quarters \u2013 cutting the annual growth rate in the year up to the third quarter from 3% to 2.6%. With fresh figures showing America\u2019s economy expanding at an annual rate of 5% in the third quarter, it will now be touch and go whether Britain is the fastest growing of the leading G7 industrial nations in 2014. The data from the ONS added spice to the political battle over economic competence when it said gross domestic product per head \u2013 one measure of living standards \u2013 was rising, but the 0.6% increase in the third quarter left the measure 1.8% below its pre-recession peak. An alternative measure of national wellbeing \u2013 net national disposable income \u2013 remained flat in the third quarter and was 5.6% below its pre-recession peak. The measure makes allowances for depreciation and for income generated in the UK that goes to overseas residents. Meanwhile, the UK\u2019s current account \u2013 which measures trade in goods and services together with investment income and payments to multinational bodies \u2013 was in the red by \u00a327bn in the July to September quarter. At 6% of gross domestic product, the current account deficit is now higher than it was during the so-called Lawson boom at the end of the 1980s, its previous peak. Shabana Mahmood MP, Labour\u2019s shadow Treasury minister, said: \u201cThese are concerning figures. Growth has been revised down for five of the last six quarters, exports continue to disappoint, and business investment fell in the last quarter. The chancellor has totally failed to rebalance the economy as he promised. And working people are still not feeling the recovery, with wages sluggish and average earnings in real terms down \u00a31,600 a year since 2010.\u201d Upward revisions to America\u2019s growth exceeded Wall Street\u2019s expectations, with the Dow Jones average pushing through 18,000 for the first time. The US economy has been growing robustly since a weather-related fall in output in the first three months of this year, and analysts believe it will expand by about 2.5% for 2014 as a whole. On the foreign exchanges, the pound fell to its lowest level in a year against the dollar and by the close of business in London was trading at just above $1.55. Currency traders believe that stronger growth will lead to the US Federal Reserve becoming the first major central bank to raise interest rates, and were taken aback both by the UK growth figures and the current account deficit. David Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce, said: \u201cWhile the quarterly results remain strong, the stark revision in annual growth confirms that the pace of recovery is slowing. The most concerning aspect of these figures is that the current deficit has risen to an unsustainably high level \u2013 due to the fall in net investment. Although the economy continues to grow, the recovery is not yet secure, and further efforts are needed to boost business investment and to help businesses export to foreign markets.\u201d An ONS breakdown of the economy\u2019s performance in the third quarter showed that growth was heavily dependent on consumer spending, which rose 0.9% on the quarter. Spending increased despite a 0.1% drop in real household incomes, with consumers running down their savings in order to make purchases. City analysts said political uncertainty might start to weigh on the pound in the coming months. Anna Stupnytska, global economist at Fidelity Worldwide Investment, said: \u201cUK growth has lost steam in recent months, with the housing sector weakness now looking well entrenched. In 2015, the headwind of political uncertainty is likely to weigh on confidence, at least for the first half of the year. \u201cHowever, the lower oil price should also start benefiting UK consumers, and although the associated boost to growth is unlikely to be as significant as in the US, it will still lend a welcome support. At the same time, the lid is likely to stay on inflation, lifting pressure off the Bank of England to tighten for the time being.\u201d Stephen Lewis, chief economist at ADM Investor Services International, said: \u201cSterling should remain stable as long as foreigners find the UK an attractive home for their capital, but the risks of a sharp fall in the pound would be considerable, given the extent of the current account deficit, if ever foreigners were to lose their appetite for UK investment. \u201cSuch an adverse turn of events might come about if UK economic or political fundamentals were to weaken. But it would not necessarily take developments specific to the UK to trigger trouble. Conditions of general risk-aversion, were they to arise, could also cut the flow of investment funds to the UK, as they did in 2008.\u201d Osborne also came under attack from his closest coalition ally, the chief secretary to the treasury, Danny Alexander. The senior Liberal Democrat said the Conservative spending plans would lead to the \u201cwilful destruction\u201d of public services. He told the Independent that pledging to cut taxes after the election was playing \u201cfast and loose\u201d with the economy and was not appropriate or right for the country.",

Amid mixed news - weak UK growth data, better than expected US GDP figures, the expected failure of the second and penultimate Greek presidential vote - the FTSE 100 finished 21.44 points higher at 6598.18. Wall Street however continued to surge ever higher, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average breaking the 18,000 barrier for the first time. By the time London closed the Dow was up around 80 points at 18,042. Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: UK stocks managed small gains on Tuesday but were held back somewhat by downward revisions to the past five quarters of economic growth. Third quarter growth remained unchanged from previous estimates but as a result of the revisions to prior quarters the annual rate dropped to 2.6%. With just over a week left until the end of the year, the Dow finally breached 18,000 after a surprisingly big upwards revision to US third quarter growth raised confidence in the US economy\u2019s ability to ride out higher interest rates. With investors spurning defensive stocks, pharmaceutical and healthcare companies fell back, not helped by a Reuters report that Express Scripts, the largest manager of prescription drug plans for US companies, was taking a tougher stance on pricing. Shire slipped 131p to \u00a345.33, AstraZeneca lost 86.5p to 4516.5p and Smith &amp; Nephew fell 19p to \u00a310.89. Housebuilders also came under pressure, on concerns about possible UK rate rises next year. Persimmon slipped 21p to \u00a315.72 and Barratt Development dipped 6.9p to 459p. With Brent crude stablising at around $60 a barrel, Tullow Oil climbed 12.7p to 419.7p. Elsewhere BG lost 6.6p to 879.5p despite agreeing the sale and leaseback of two LNG vessels for $460m. Reckitt Benckiser recovered from early falls to end 10p higher at \u00a352 as it completed the demerger of pharmacy business Indivior, which ended at 150p. Among the mid-caps, hedge fund group Man edged up 0.7p to 158.1p after a positive note from Panmure Gordon: Assuming that [flagship fund] AHL continues to benefit as it has in the second half of 2014 from the withdrawal of quantitative easing and deliver good investment returns in 2015, we have increased our profit estimate by 20% on the basis of higher performance fees.

Lower down the market Thorntons shares melted 22% to 92p after the chocolate specialist warned on profits after lower than expected orders from major supermarkets.

      "bodyText": "John Lewis reported a drop in sales last week, after November\u2019s Black Friday sucked demand forward from December and shoppers left their Christmas purchases to the last minute in the hope of bigger bargains. Sales at the department store chain were \u00a3160.6m in the week to last Saturday, up 6.5% on the previous week but down 2.4% from a year ago. John Lewis, seen as a barometer of the high street, said customers were delaying their Christmas shopping. Online sales rose 5.5% year-on-year. It also pointed to the \u201cchanging shape of Christmas trade, with an early peak at the end of November\u201d when British retailers fired the starting gun on the festive shopping season with the adoption of the US tradition of Black Friday. Andrew Murphy, retail director at John Lewis, said Black Friday looks to have been the biggest shopping day of the year, with 27 December, when the in-store post-Christmas sale begins, set to be the second biggest. \u201cIt\u2019s fair to say all our expectations about yesterday were met and I don\u2019t see any reason for today to be any different. Christmas Eve tends to be a quieter day. Only the customers with nerves of steel wait until then. Very often it\u2019s the menfolk that come in to grab a bottle of perfume. Usually trade begins to fade away at 2pm, but I think it will be slightly busier than last year.\u201d Murphy added that John Lewis was benefiting from the delivery problems experienced by some of its competitors. The retailer is giving customers an extra day to order click and collect items to its shops, by extending the cut-off date for orders to Tuesday for collection on Christmas Eve. The clearance sale starts online on Wednesday. The John Lewis fashion, home, menswear and sports departments posted record sales weeks, with sales of sports technology such as running watches leaping 90%. Childrenswear posted an 11% increase in sales, fuelled by 24% growth in nightwear, owing to the enduring popularity of onesies. Retail analyst Nick Bubb said: \u201cJohn Lewis continues to run rings around M&amp;S and other high street rivals and it is clearly outperforming the market in general, but its electricals bias worked against it last week.\u201d Sales of electrical items and home appliances at John Lewis slid 10.8%, a sign of the growing importance of Black Friday on pre-Christmas shopping. Small items fared better: GHD hair straighteners posted 44% growth and sales of Nespresso coffeemakers were up 13%. Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at IHS Global Insight, said: \u201cRetailers are very aware that extended low earnings growth and high debt levels has limited many people\u2019s purchasing power and this is likely to keep them active on the promotions front right up to Christmas Eve as well as in the post-Christmas clearance sales. \u201cIt is very possible that Christmas shopping will end up being pretty strong overall this year, but it will be interesting to see to what extent the discounting and promotions have hit retailers\u2019 margins.\u201d",

Reducing the deficit has been at the heart of what the chancellor likes to call his long-term economic plan. The plan, we are assured by the Treasury, is working. Well, here\u2019s the latest news. Growth is not quite so robust as the government previously thought it was. The expansion relies heavily on consumers spending money they haven\u2019t got. And Britain has not one deficit but two: a record current account deficit to go alongside a still stubbornly high budget deficit. The size of the current account deficit is worrying. Britain has a history of being in the red on its external accounts, because of the tendency to consume more than we produce and to import more than we export. But usually big current account deficits come at the end of raging booms, as was the case in 1973 and 1988. Today\u2019s current account deficit is running at 6% of GDP, higher than in the early 1970s or the late 1980s, and it comes when the recovery is only 18 months old. What\u2019s happened is this. Ever since the de-industrialisation of the early 1980s, Britain has run a hefty and growing deficit on its trade in goods, which stood at \u00a332bn in the third quarter of 2014. Fortunately, this dismal performance was offset by the efforts of the UK\u2019s service sector, which racked up a surplus of \u00a323bn. That left a trade deficit of \u00a39bn for the third quarter. But the current account is more than just trade. It also takes account of how well Britain\u2019s overseas investments are doing: not just foreign direct investment (FDI) but punts made on overseas markets. Here, there have been two recent trends. Firstly, the UK has been doing less well on its portfolio investments than in the boom days before the financial crash. More recently, overseas investors have been making more money on their FDI in the UK than UK investors have been making on their FDI abroad. The primary income account added \u00a312.6bn to the current account deficit in the third quarter. On top of this there is the secondary income account. This is mainly the money Britain pays for the running of international organisations such as the European Union, the United Nations and the World Bank. This added up to just over \u00a35bn in the third quarter. There was a time when a current account deficit of much less than 6% of GDP would have seriously troubled the financial markets. Why they are not more worried by the hidden half of Britain\u2019s twin-deficit problem is something of a mystery, because it is clear that the country can no longer rely on North Sea oil and the racier activities of the City of London to mask the chronic deficit on visible trade. When the markets do start to focus on the current account, this is what they will find. Firstly, export performance has been disappointing despite a 30% drop in the value of the pound between 2007 and 2009. Secondly, the recovery from the recession has been of the bog standard variety: based around rising consumer spending that will suck in imports. Thirdly, there is a real difference in the way the government approaches the twin deficit. Osborne has a plan for the budget deficit, even if it is flawed. For the current account deficit, there is no plan at all.",

Given these arguments, and the fact that this seems to be an early stage of approach and that Seplat has only until 19 January to make an offer, we believe that, at this stage, there is more likelihood than not that this transaction will not happen. Therefore, we would not encourage investors to buy into Afren simply on the back of this announcement.</p> </blockquote> <p>Supermarkets are higher on hopes of a Christmas boost, with troubled <strong>Tesco</strong> up 3.65p to 184.65p and <strong>Morrisons</strong> 3p better at 179p.<br></p>",

In light of the Indivior spin and our earnings revisions, we revise our target price from \u00a350 to \u00a345. We maintain our underperform rating. Overall the FTSE 100 is currently 26.30 points higher at 6603.04 after an overnight rally on Wall Street. With oil fairly stable - Brent crude is up just 0.37% at $60.3 a barrel - investors are reasonably calm ahead of the festive shutdown. But there could be some volatility with the latest Greek election vote and US GDP figures later. Weir, which supplies pumping equipment to the energy industry, has recovered 46p to \u00a319.20 but BG Group continues to be weak, down 17.5p at 868.6p. Afren has added another 1.61p to 51p after Monday\u2019s revelation of bid interest from Nigeria\u2019s Seplat. But Oriel Securities was sceptical a deal would be done. Analyst Dragan Trajkov said: In our view, while such a combination has advantages in terms of geographic focus and balance sheet strength, typically an early leak of a possible transaction results in no transaction (for instance, Petroceltic/Dragon Oil, CEPSA/Salamander, Bowleven/Dragon Oil). We note that an agreement on valuation is made more difficult post a significant share price movement. Furthermore, in this particular case, you would have a company with a free cash flow and dividend (Seplat) buying a company with high debt (Afren), probably causing some Seplat shareholders to at least question the deal at present (ie it would have to be cheap). Given these arguments, and the fact that this seems to be an early stage of approach and that Seplat has only until 19 January to make an offer, we believe that, at this stage, there is more likelihood than not that this transaction will not happen. Therefore, we would not encourage investors to buy into Afren simply on the back of this announcement. Supermarkets are higher on hopes of a Christmas boost, with troubled Tesco up 3.65p to 184.65p and Morrisons 3p better at 179p.",

      "bodyText": "UK retailers are facing increased financial stress this year as the big supermarkets fight a price war that has forced the rest of the high street to slash prices and squeeze profit margins. As retailers prepare for the quarterly rent day on Christmas Day, traditionally the time when banks call in the administrators, more than 24,000 retailers are suffering from significant financial distress, according to research by the advisory firm Begbies Traynor. The number is up 54% compared with the same time a year ago, with food and clothing retailers among the worst hit. Begbies Traynor said as many as 135 businesses were in critical condition as retailers chased sales in the final days of Christmas. The accountancy firm did not name specific retailers but those in difficulty are thought to include Austin Reed, the tailoring firm, which is understood to be close to appointing Deloitte to work on a rescue deal that may include a company voluntary arrangement allowing it to sell off unprofitable stores. Julie Palmer, a retail expert at Begbies Traynor, said: \u201cBlack Friday was lauded as the biggest day of the retail sales this year but it seems the only real winners were the largest online retailers and the big-brand high street chains with the biggest discounts.\u201d Administrators said it was unlikely that 2014 would see a repeat of the mass retail failures of early 2013 when HMV, Blockbuster and Jessops followed the collapse of Comet in late 2012.
