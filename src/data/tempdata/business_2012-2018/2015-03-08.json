Joe Hockey, betraying perhaps an insecurity about his own performance as treasurer, has decided to act as though he were in opposition and has made the report as much about kickingLabor\u2019s economic performance than attempting to paint a picture of the challenges for the next 40 years. </p> <p>Every intergenerational report is only as good as the assumptions on which the predictions are based \u2013 especially those pertaining to demographics. And while some of the predictions about the ageing population and the implications that will have on employment participation and economic growth are worth considering, the assumptions about government spending over the next 40 years are pretty much a farrago of idiocy.</p> <p>For no good reason whatsoever, Hockey has decided for the first time to include in the report projection based on policies of the former government. But he takes as the ALP\u2019s \u201cprevious policy\u201d that represented in the 2013-14 <a href=\"http://www.budget.gov.au/2013-14/content/myefo/html/03_part_3.htm\">mid-year economic and fiscal outlook</a>(Myefo) \u2013 a document produced by the Abbott government and which saw the 2013-14 deficit increase by $10.26bn due to \u201cpolicy decisions\u201d taken by the Abbott government. </p> <p>The 2013-14 Myefo was itself designed to make it appear the ALP had blown the budget, and thus using that as the starting point to predict budget deficits over the next 40 years is a fairly dodgy exercise. </p> <p>But from this beginning, the report happily assumes that under the scenario the government would not change any spending policy for 40 years, debt by 2055 would reach 122% of GDP. </p> <p>Yeah, right. </p> <p>To get to that figure, not only does it assume there will be no changes in spending, but even more stupidly, that while the deficit grew ever more over the next 40 years, governments would be cutting income taxes at the same time. </p> <p>As <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0005858/\">Jeanie Bueller</a> <a href=\"http://www.moviesounds.com/ferrisb/fertilize.wav\">would say</a>, dry that one out and you could fertilise the lawn. </p> <p>The report estimates that from 2020-21 tax rates will be capped at \u201ca constant 23.9% of GDP\u201d. This level was picked because it was the \u201caverage of the period 2000-01 to 2007-08\u201d.

In December 2010 a record high 67.7% of the adult population was participating in the labour force \u2013 it is now 64.7%.

The median population projection assumed currently by the ABS is for 240,000 migrants a year.</p> <p>It\u2019s also worth noting that the <a href=\"http://www.immi.gov.au/media/publications/statistics/immigration-update/nom-sep-2014.pdf\">Department of Immigration </a>estimates net migration to increase from 225,800 last to 256,900 in 2018.</p> <p>The report even estimates from 2007-2018 annual migration will be the equivalent of 1.1% of the population, but will then for reasons unknown fall to just over 0.5% from then till 2055.</p> <p>The report notes that this 0.5% level was the average observed between 1973 and 2006. Why that 33-year period suddenly became an important benchmark for migration levels is unsaid. Why not the past 40 years? Why not 2001-2007 as was the case for tax? </p> <p>The report thus assumes that in the face of an ageing population, Australian governments would shrink the real migration intake \u2013 even though that would exacerbate the problem! </p> <p>The only reason you would make such an assumption is if you wanted to be able to paint a picture of slowing growth, falling participation, rising debt and deficits and weak economic growth \u2013 exactly the picture Joe Hockey wants to suggest would have been the case under an ALP government. And exactly the picture he wants to paint in order to justify his proposed cuts to government expenditure. </p> <p>To demonstrate how absurd this suggestion is, the report even notes that if the net migration intake was estimated at 250,000 per year (i.e. still less than is expected in 2018), then the improvement in real gross national income per person by 2055 would be the same as if the report assumed the unemployment rate for the next 40 years was 4% instead of 5%.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/am/content/2015/s4192235.htm\">On ABC\u2019s AM</a> program, Hockey suggested \u201cImmigration is, you know, is a rather lazy way to try and grow your economy.

      "bodyText": "Kevin Spacey, looking greyer and paunchier as President Underwood in the third series of House of Cards, shocked Democratic party leaders when he told them a plan to create 10m jobs must be paid for with dramatic reductions in benefits, especially for the old. As usual, it was hard to tell if the move was a genuine tilt at a social democratic legacy or yet another tactic in Underwood\u2019s never-ending scramble for survival. Taking him at his word, Underwood\u2019s jobs plan is a return of fire in the long battle of the generations, with the fictional president attacking better-off baby boomers on behalf of blue collar families and the young. It is a battle that no politician can consider in the UK. With an election looming, one that is dominated by appealing to the over 55s, the money available for the young is pitifully small \u2013 and is going to get smaller whichever of the major parties lead the next government. The only way out must be for the party manifestos to address some of the taboos about the over 55s that no one wants to discuss. Here are six: Pensioners need their own tax system The range of pensioner incomes is more compressed than for the general population. Even people who enjoy a combination of the state pension, the state\u2019s earnings-related top-up and a private pension rarely enter the 40p tax bracket. Why not have a separate sliding scale of income tax bands for the over 65s. These could have lower personal threshold (when traditionally it has been higher) and a 40p tax band that starts at \u00a325,000 (almost \u00a342,000 at present) and a 45p band for those banking \u00a380,000 a year \u2013 which means more tax gained from Fred Goodwin\u2019s \u00a3300,000 RBS pension. The coalition\u2019s policy of increasing the personal tax threshold to \u00a310,000 and beyond, combined with their lower average incomes means better-off pensioners are lightly taxed. This should change. Overhaul pension tax relief There has long been a campaign to limit pension tax relief, which amounts to around \u00a330bn a year. A host of other incentives, such as employer\u2019s relief on national insurance contributions and tax relief on the investment income, make a bad situation worse. In a Centre for Policy Studies report, former investment banker and David Cameron adviser Michael Johnson calculated that over the 10 years until 2012 the pension tax relief amounted to \u00a3358.6bn. Put aside that much of the money was put on the stock market and went nowhere, the central point is that most of government subsidy went to better off workers. The situation has become increasingly upsetting for low-paid and part-time workers who earn under the \u00a310,000 income tax threshold and are therefore excluded from tax relief system altogether. The state pension must evolve Pensioners are one of the big winners from the last five years of austerity. According to the Institute for Fiscal Studies, by this April the over 65s will be \u00a34.6bn better off than they would be if the coalition had ignored calls for a \u201ctriple lock\u201d that makes sure the state pension increases in line with rising inflation, earnings growth or 2.5%, whichever is higher. Pensioners benefits, including the free TV licence for the over 75s and winter fuel allowance. Labour and Liberal Democrats have promised to means test the winter fuel allowance, but only to save \u00a3100m, which is a small proportion of a \u00a378bn bill that amounts to almost 50% of welfare spending. The next government should only link the state pension to inflation, while recycling some of the savings from lower pension tax relief into more generous council services for the disabled and infirm. We must build homes for the old, not the young On Saturday, the television celebrity Kirstie Allsopp lectured Radio 4\u2019s Saturday Live audience with her belief that the nation needs lots of homes made from pre-fab kits to house young families. Sounds good, but as a report by the Intergenerational Foundation made clear, the housing crisis is more about encouraging empty nest baby boomers out of their four-bedroom homes into something better and more suited to their needs. These might be high rises in the centre of town or a bungalow. More likely, they would be on an estate, of which there are too few, that look and feel like any other private, well-designed collection of homes, but are in fact specially designed communities. Some councils and housing associations have adopted innovative designs and for their trouble have long waiting lists. The government needs to ease old people out of family homes, not with a stick, but a carrot, otherwise they will never move and young families, knowing no better, will be condemned to live in modern rabbit hutches. Wealth taxes are a must How else to shift the burden of taxation away from the young? Only a tax on parent and grandparent wealth will suffice. Labour\u2019s mansion tax is a start. It is not very elegant and critics who say a tax on \u00a32m-plus homes should be part of a revamped council tax can argue it would be a simpler and more coherent reform. But if the target must, in the first instance, only be the very rich, then it is a good place to start. Next stop should be taxes on land more generally, which has become the source of endless speculative activity. The International Monetary Fund and the Paris-based OECD thinktank have argued for a switch away from taxes on incomes to taxes on wealth. In Britain wealth is lightly taxed, encouraging the better off to find ways of taking an income from gains in wealth (capital gains tax at 28%) rather than gains in income (higher rate tax at 40% or 45% for those earning more than \u00a3150,000) The national debt is not a tax on the young Britain entered the financial crisis in 2007 with comparatively low debts of just over 43% of GDP. Now it is heading for 90%, depending on the measure used. But the cost of servicing the debt and who pays the taxes to finance the annual debt payments is the key. If the burden of debt payments has shifted to older workers through extra taxes on wealth and the interest rate on the debts are low (and they will remain low while there is too much savings chasing too few reliable sovereign bonds assets, like the UK\u2019s) then the extra debt burden in a few years is not so costly and it is not just the young paying. \u2022 This article was amended on 8 March 2015.

      "body": "<p>Kevin Spacey, looking greyer and paunchier as President Underwood in the third series of House of Cards, shocked Democratic party leaders when he told them a plan to create 10m jobs must be paid for with dramatic reductions in benefits, especially for the old.</p> <p>As usual, it was hard to tell if the move was a genuine tilt at a social democratic legacy or yet another tactic in Underwood\u2019s never-ending scramble for survival. Taking him at his word, Underwood\u2019s jobs plan is a return of fire in the long battle of the generations, with the fictional president attacking better-off baby boomers on behalf of blue collar families and the young.</p> <p>It is a battle that no politician can consider in the UK. With an election looming, one that is dominated by appealing to the over 55s, the money available for the young is pitifully small \u2013 and is going to get smaller whichever of the major parties lead the next government. </p> <p>The only way out must be for the party manifestos to address some of the taboos about the over 55s that no one wants to discuss. Here are six:</p> <h2>Pensioners need their own tax system</h2> <p>The range of pensioner incomes is more compressed than for the general population. Even people who enjoy a combination of the state pension, the state\u2019s earnings-related top-up and a private pension rarely enter the 40p tax bracket. Why not have a separate sliding scale of income tax bands for the over 65s. These could have lower personal threshold (when traditionally it has been higher) and a 40p tax band that starts at \u00a325,000 (almost \u00a342,000 at present) and a 45p band for those banking \u00a380,000 a year \u2013 which means more tax gained from Fred Goodwin\u2019s \u00a3300,000 RBS pension. The coalition\u2019s policy of increasing the personal tax threshold to \u00a310,000 and beyond, combined with their lower average incomes means better-off pensioners are lightly taxed. This should change.</p> <h2>Overhaul pension tax relief</h2> <p>There has long been a campaign to limit pension tax relief, which amounts to around \u00a330bn a year. A host of other incentives, such as employer\u2019s relief on national insurance contributions and tax relief on the investment income, make a bad situation worse. In a Centre for Policy Studies report, former investment banker and David Cameron adviser Michael Johnson calculated that over the 10 years until 2012 the pension tax relief amounted to \u00a3358.6bn. Put aside that much of the money was put on the stock market and went nowhere, the central point is that most of government subsidy went to better off workers. The situation has become increasingly upsetting for low-paid and part-time workers who earn under the \u00a310,000 income tax threshold and are therefore excluded from tax relief system altogether.</p> <h2>The state pension must evolve</h2> <p>Pensioners are one of the big winners from the last five years of austerity. According to the Institute for Fiscal Studies, by this April the over 65s will be \u00a34.6bn better off than they would be if the coalition had ignored calls for a \u201ctriple lock\u201d that makes sure the state pension increases in line with rising inflation, earnings growth or 2.5%, whichever is higher. Pensioners benefits, including the free TV licence for the over 75s and winter fuel allowance. Labour and Liberal Democrats have promised to means test the winter fuel allowance, but only to save \u00a3100m, which is a small proportion of a \u00a378bn bill that amounts to almost 50% of welfare spending. The next government should only link the state pension to inflation, while recycling some of the savings from lower pension tax relief into more generous council services for the disabled and infirm.</p> <h2>We must build homes for the old, not the young</h2> <p>On Saturday, the television celebrity Kirstie Allsopp lectured Radio 4\u2019s Saturday Live audience with her belief that the nation needs lots of homes made from pre-fab kits to house young families. Sounds good, but as a report by the Intergenerational Foundation made clear, the housing crisis is more about encouraging empty nest baby boomers out of their four-bedroom homes into something better and more suited to their needs. These might be high rises in the centre of town or a bungalow. More likely, they would be on an estate, of which there are too few, that look and feel like any other private, well-designed collection of homes, but are in fact specially designed communities. Some councils and housing associations have adopted innovative designs and for their trouble have long waiting lists. The government needs to ease old people out of family homes, not with a stick, but a carrot, otherwise they will never move and young families, knowing no better, will be condemned to live in modern rabbit hutches.</p> <h2>Wealth taxes are a must</h2> <p> How else to shift the burden of taxation away from the young? Only a tax on parent and grandparent wealth will suffice. Labour\u2019s mansion tax is a start. It is not very elegant and critics who say a tax on \u00a32m-plus homes should be part of a revamped council tax can argue it would be a simpler and more coherent reform. But if the target must, in the first instance, only be the very rich, then it is a good place to start.

Now it is heading for 90%, depending on the measure used. But the cost of servicing the debt and who pays the taxes to finance the annual debt payments is the key.

      "bodyText": "Greece\u2019s anti-austerity government has raised the spectre of further political strife in the crisis-plagued country by saying it will consider calling a referendum, or fresh elections, if its eurozone partners reject proposed reforms from Athens. Racheting up the pressure ahead of a crucial meeting of his eurozone counterparts on Monday, the Greek finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, said the leftist-led government would hold a plebiscite on fiscal policy if faced with deadlock. \u201cWe are not attached to our posts. If needed, if we encounter implacability, we will resort to the Greek people either through elections or a referendum,\u201d he told Italy\u2019s Il Corriere della Sera in an interview on Sunday. Varoufakis was the second high-ranking official in as many days to suggest the possibility of a referendum being held. On Saturday, Panos Kammenos, who heads the government\u2019s junior partner in office, the small, rightwing Independent Greeks party, said such a ballot could be a \u201cpossible response\u201d to protracted disagreement with creditor bodies propping up Greece\u2019s debt-stricken economy. \u201cIf [lenders] question the will of the Greek people and of the government, one possible response would be to carry out a referendum,\u201d Kammenos, who is also defence minister, told the financial weekly Agora. Reforms have been set as a condition for unlocking a \u20ac7.2bn (\u00a35.2bn) tranche of aid that Athens has yet to draw down from its \u20ac240bn bailout programme agreed with the EU, the European Central Bank (ECB) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). With Greece shut out of capital markets, the disbursement is vital to meeting debt obligations. A letter outlining prospective government reforms \u2013 including the novel idea of clamping down on tax evasion by enlisting the support of tourists and housewives \u2013 was dispatched to the Euro group chairman Jeroen Dijsselbloem on Friday. But with the proposals reportedly receiving a lukewarm response, the Greek finance ministry spent the weekend feverishly fine-tuning the policies. One EU official in Brussels was quoted as saying that the leaked letter \u201cbore no relation\u201d to the deal recently reached between Athens and its creditors enabling the country to extend its current bailout programme until June. Another described the proposals as \u201camateurish\u201d. Faced with the prospect of a new credit crunch, the prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, also worked the phones at the weekend, speaking with French President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande and the ECB president Mario Draghi. Insolvent Greece has reached this point before. But patience is also running out with Athens. The elevation to office of Tsipras\u2019 anti-establishment Syriza party has strained relations with partners \u2013 not least Germany, which has provided the bulk of Athens\u2019s bailout finds \u2013 more than ever before. Six weeks after it was catapulted into power, the leftist-dominated administration has been accused of foul play, political immaturity and exhibiting a marked lack of diplomacy in negotiations. \u201cThe new government has used a considerable amount of political capital but has received very little in return for it,\u201d said Dr Jens Bastian, an independent economic analyst with the Macropolis thinktank in Athens. \u201cTrust with institutional partners at the European level has been eroded, a working relationship [between Greece and its international creditors] has yet to be established,\u201d he added. \u201cFrom Berlin\u2019s perspective there is an increasing amount of fatigue, irritation, confusion about the new government in Athens. Both sides have yet to find a common language, let alone a roadmap towards more constructive engagement.\u201d Greece\u2019s fiscal black hole \u2013 estimated by the IMF as at least \u20ac12.2bn last year and exacerbated by a precipitous drop in tax revenues in recent months \u2013 has left the government with just enough funds to cover state expenditure but little else. \u201cI can only say that we have money to pay the salaries and pensions of public employees,\u201d Varoufakis told the Italian newspaper. \u201cFor the rest we will have to see.\u201d Ahead of tomorrow\u2019s meeting, creditors have signaled that they want Athens to specify reforms with \u201charder facts and figures\u201d including showing a renewed commitment to the country\u2019s stalled privatisation process. Militants on the far-left of Syriza have made such \u201casset stripping\u201d a \u201cred line\u201d that they will not cross. \u201cThe country is at war with lenders,\u201d warned the interior minister, Nikos Voutsis, giving voice to the increasingly combative sentiments now colouring relations with creditors. \u201cEvery month the leash is getting tighter for us. But we are not going to proceed in this war like happy scouts ready to follow bailout policies.\u201d With the rhetoric at such levels, Athens is treading a very fine line. Piling on the pressure, senior ECB officials also repeated at the weekend that the Frankfurt-based institution would not allow Greece to issue more short-term debt on the basis that it would be tantamount to illegally financing the Greek government. Last week, Draghi insisted that lending to Greek banks would only resume once the new government in Athens implemented reforms. Greece\u2019s young premier has said in the absence of rescue funds that his administration will resort to short-term treasury bills to cover cash shortfalls in the coming weeks. \u201cIf the ECB insists on this decision, which in our opinion is not the right one, then it will be taking on a major responsibility,\u201d Tsipras told Der Spiegel before appealing to Draghi by phone on Saturday to change course. With the current impasse threatening to lead Greece into defaulting on its payments and the spectre of a referendum renewing fears of further turmoil for an economy already blighted by the twin ills of bankruptcy and political uncertainty, Varoufakis\u2019 remarks were quickly described as \u201cirresponsible\u201d by the political opposition. Former prime minister Antonis Samaras, who now heads the main opposition centre-right New Democracy party, said a plebiscite would be \u201ca very bad development\u201d. The government clarified on Sunday that a referendum would only take place if negotiations failed and would not relate to Greece\u2019s place in the eurozone \u2013 which Tsipras insists is a given \u2013 but government policy.",

One EU official in Brussels was quoted as saying that the leaked letter \u201cbore no relation\u201d to the deal recently reached between Athens and its creditors enabling the country to extend its current bailout programme until June. Another described the proposals as \u201camateurish\u201d.</p> <p>Faced with the prospect of a new credit crunch, the prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, also worked the phones at the weekend, speaking with French President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande and the ECB president Mario Draghi.</p> <p>Insolvent Greece has reached this point before. But patience is also running out with Athens. The elevation to office of Tsipras\u2019 anti-establishment Syriza party has strained relations with partners \u2013 not least Germany, which has provided the bulk of Athens\u2019s bailout finds \u2013 more than ever before. </p> <p>Six weeks after it was catapulted into power, the leftist-dominated administration has been accused of foul play, political immaturity and exhibiting a marked lack of diplomacy in negotiations.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe new government has used a considerable amount of political capital but has received very little in return for it,\u201d said Dr Jens Bastian, an independent economic analyst with the Macropolis thinktank in Athens.<br></p> <p>\u201cTrust with institutional partners at the European level has been eroded, a working relationship [between Greece and its international creditors] has yet to be established,\u201d he added. </p> <p>\u201cFrom Berlin\u2019s perspective there is an increasing amount of fatigue, irritation, confusion about the new government in Athens. Both sides have yet to find a common language, let alone a roadmap towards more constructive engagement.\u201d</p> <p>Greece\u2019s fiscal black hole \u2013 estimated by the IMF as at least \u20ac12.2bn last year and exacerbated by a precipitous drop in tax revenues in recent months \u2013 has left the government with just enough funds to cover state expenditure but little else.<br></p> <p>\u201cI can only say that we have money to pay the salaries and pensions of public employees,\u201d Varoufakis told the Italian newspaper. \u201cFor the rest we will have to see.\u201d <br></p> <p>Ahead of tomorrow\u2019s meeting, creditors have signaled that they want Athens to specify reforms with \u201charder facts and figures\u201d including showing a renewed commitment to the country\u2019s stalled privatisation process. Militants on the far-left of Syriza have made such \u201casset stripping\u201d a \u201cred line\u201d that they will not cross. </p> <p>\u201cThe country is at war with lenders,\u201d warned the interior minister, Nikos Voutsis, giving voice to the increasingly combative sentiments now colouring relations with creditors. \u201cEvery month the leash is getting tighter for us. But we are not going to proceed in this war like happy scouts ready to follow bailout policies.\u201d <br></p> <p>With the rhetoric at such levels, Athens is treading a very fine line. Piling on the pressure, senior ECB officials also repeated at the weekend that the Frankfurt-based institution would not allow Greece to issue more short-term debt on the basis that it would be tantamount to illegally financing the Greek government. Last week, Draghi insisted that lending to Greek banks would only resume once the new government in Athens implemented reforms. </p> <p>Greece\u2019s young premier has said in the absence of rescue funds that his administration will resort to short-term treasury bills to cover cash shortfalls in the coming weeks. </p> <p>\u201cIf the ECB insists on this decision, which in our opinion is not the right one, then it will be taking on a major responsibility,\u201d Tsipras told Der Spiegel before appealing to Draghi by phone on Saturday to change course. </p> <p>With the current impasse threatening to lead Greece into defaulting on its payments and the spectre of a referendum renewing fears of further turmoil for an economy already blighted by the twin ills of bankruptcy and political uncertainty, Varoufakis\u2019 remarks were quickly described as \u201cirresponsible\u201d by the political opposition.</p> <p>Former prime minister Antonis Samaras, who now heads the main opposition centre-right New Democracy party, said a plebiscite would be \u201ca very bad development\u201d.</p> <p>The government clarified on Sunday that a referendum would only take place if negotiations failed and would not relate to Greece\u2019s place in the eurozone \u2013 which Tsipras insists is a given \u2013 but government policy. </p>",

The growth vouchers scheme was launched in January 2014 and billed by the coalition as \u201ca pioneering programme to help support 20,000 small businesses get the advice they need to achieve their growth potential\u201d. At that time, the Department for Business Innovation and Skills (BIS) said: \u201cThis \u00a330m programme will provide an immediate cash injection of up to \u00a32,000 for eligible small businesses to gain professional business advice in areas such as marketing, recruitment and finance.\u201d With the scheme due to close on 31 March, the Department for Business Innovation and Skills says that so far 2,132 growth vouchers worth \u00a33.6m have been claimed by small businesses. In addition, businesses had received \u00a31.2m worth of advice to help them identify the support they need, added a spokeswoman. The scheme is open to companies with fewer than 250 employees and it selects successful applicants at random to receive a voucher of up to \u00a32,000 to pay for business advice. The company must match that voucher funding, paying for half of the cost of advice. A progress report on the scheme published last month highlighted that some firms were receiving vouchers but not redeeming them, with most of them citing a lack of cash available for adding their 50% share. The BIS told the Guardian: \u201cThere are still 5,694 vouchers in businesses\u2019 possession worth \u00a311m that are yet to be spent and we will continue to distribute vouchers through to the end of March when the programme officially closes. \u201cMore than 12,000 growth vouchers have been issued since the initiative launched in January 2014. \u201cEvidence gathered from this demand-led research programme will help us develop better business support schemes in the future as well as helping businesses decide what type of advice they need to grow,\u201d she added. In its assessmentlast month, BIS said it was primarily a research programme to determine if businesses which use external advice perform better than those that do not. But it also said the growth vouchers scheme \u201caims to offer business support to thousands of businesses\u201d. The BIS said the original estimate was that it would need 19,000 firms to have a business needs assessment to produce \u201crobust evidence\u201d for the research. The number was later revised down to 12,000. The BIS added: \u201cAs we have already exceeded this figure, we are confident the key research objectives for this programme will be met.\u201d One small business owner turned down for a voucher said he felt misled by the scheme. Richard White is opening a bar and restaurant in Exmouth and wanted to use a growth voucher to get help with marketing. He heard about the scheme at a trade fair and was optimistic his application would succeed. However, he received a message at the end of the online application saying he would not be receiving a voucher because the allocation process is done on a \u201crandom basis\u201d. White said: \u201cI got a computer says \u2018no\u2019, basically.\u201d He added: \u201cI think the whole thing is misleading. I think it\u2019s been set up to make the government sound like they are caring ... but [the scheme] doesn\u2019t seem to have done as much as it set out to do.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Bill Gates, the billionaire philanthropist, can lay claim to a lifetime of achievements, but confessed earlier this year that a foreign language was missing from his CV. During an online chat, the former Microsoft chairman and world\u2019s richest man said he feels \u201cpretty stupid\u201d that learning a foreign language had eluded him. In an attempt to tackle the problem, he rejected using some of his $79bn wealth to hire a private tutor. Instead he joined the 70 million people around the world who have logged on to Duolingo, the free online courses that aims to democratise the teaching of languages to anyone with a smartphone, tablet or laptop and an internet connection. Launched in 2012, the app applies computer science to the teaching of English, French, Spanish and German \u2013 as well as other languages \u2013 by developing a \u201ctree\u201d of skills in which the user goes from one challenge to the next. The method has been curated by examining how thousands of users react to learning one skill, for example verbs, before another, such as adjectives, and finding the most beneficial. Behind the online phenomenon are founders Luis von Ahn and Severin Hacker, two computer scientists who generated the idea while working on a project to translate web pages at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. What emerged is an app in which the user answers multiple-choice questions, speaks translations into a microphone, and types in phrases in a structured tree of learning. Before its inception, the 35-year-old Von Ahn was already a millionaire having sold two companies to Google \u2013 he is credited with being a co-inventor of the Captcha web security system, which uses distorted sequences of words to recognise a human user. Having grown up in Guatemala, he wanted to develop an educational opportunity for which those without money could learn a language, advance their chances of getting a job and increase their income potential. \u201cIt has a lot to do with where I grew up because I did grow up in a very poor country, in Guatemala. In the case of education, something amazing happens when everyone can have access to the same education,\u201d he says. \u201cMy main philosophy is that everyone should have equal access \u2013 and unfortunately not even Duolingo is equal access because it requires you to have a phone. It requires you to have a data plan for your phone \u2026 but it is the closest I know how to get equal access.\u201d Behind the company lies the belief that there is something broken with educational systems around the world, in that students can often leave school with limited knowledge despite 12 years of learning or that teachers can find it difficult to focus on a mixed-ability class of students. By using algorithms to estimate how well users work on an exercise, people who fare better will get different questions than those that find experience difficulty in the Duolingo classes. Von Ahn says education around the world could work much better. \u201cThere are one billion adults in the world that don\u2019t know how to read and write and we are in the 21st century, and that is unfathomable to me.\u201d \u201cEven in developed countries, even here in the United States, people have to study maths for 12 years and at the end they barely know how to add fractions. The average graduating senior from the United States does not really know how to add fractions which is also ridiculous for something that literally every single day of your life for 12 years you had to do \u2026 they could learn how to add fractions in probably a month.\u201d In the UK, around 2.5 million have signed up. Of Duolingo\u2019s 70m registered user, about 15 million are active every month. The large drop-off rate \u2013 which includes Bill Gates, who said in the Reddit interview that he gave up without giving a reason \u2013 is a by-product of online learning, says von Ahn. His ambition is to develop a service that is as good as having a one-on-one tutor. The app\u2019s highest level of achievementallows the user to express themselves in a limited way in familiar situations - in that they will be able to communicate though they will not be fluent. \u201cWe want to be as good as a human one-on-one tutor but we are not there yet,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are nowhere near as adaptive as a human tutor who, by looking at your facial expression [sees] you are a little hesitant on something. They may bring [that] kind of human touch to it and we are not as good as that but I think we could be. It will take a really long time to get as good as a human tutor, to be honest.\u201d Duolingo does not charge for lessons, or has ads, instead generating revenuevia a service in which users practice language skills by translating articles for clients, such as CNN. It also makes money through a certification system in which users can take a test to prove their language proficiency \u2013 a multibillion-dollar industry, according to Von Ahn, to which Dulingo aims to become the gold standard. Among the investors who have pumped $38.3m of venture capital into the company has been actor Ashton Kutcher. The investors are committed to not charging for the teaching content, says von Ahn. After languages, he says, the next move may be to teach literacy, which can also have an immediate impact on employment opportunities. The ambition is to have a range of apps which teach a number of subjects intuitively, he says. List of languages What can you learn? Speakers of different languages are taught new tongues separately so a Russian speaker can learn English or German, a Korean speaker can learn English, and a French speaker can learn Spanish and Italian. There are 39 courses in total with 23 on the way. English speakers can learn Spanish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Dutch, Irish, Swedish and Danish.",

The average graduating senior from the United States does not really know how to add fractions which is also ridiculous for something that literally every single day of your life for 12 years you had to do \u2026 they could learn how to add fractions in probably a month.\u201d</p> <p>In the UK, around 2.5 million have signed up. Of Duolingo\u2019s 70m registered user, about 15 million are active every month. The large drop-off rate \u2013 which includes Bill Gates, who said in the Reddit interview that he gave up without giving a reason \u2013 is a by-product of online learning, says von Ahn. His ambition is to develop a service that is as good as having a one-on-one tutor.<br></p> <p>The app\u2019s highest level of achievementallows the user to express themselves in a limited way in familiar situations - in that they will be able to communicate though they will not be fluent. </p> <p>\u201cWe want to be as good as a human one-on-one tutor but we are not there yet,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are nowhere near as adaptive as a human tutor who, by looking at your facial expression [sees] you are a little hesitant on something. They may bring [that] kind of human touch to it and we are not as good as that but I think we could be. It will take a really long time to get as good as a human tutor, to be honest.\u201d</p> <p>Duolingo does not charge for lessons, or has ads, instead generating revenuevia a service in which users practice language skills by translating articles for clients, such as CNN. It also makes money through a certification system in which users can take a test to prove their language proficiency \u2013 a multibillion-dollar industry, according to Von Ahn, to which Dulingo aims to become the gold standard. </p> <p>Among the investors who have pumped $38.3m of venture capital into the company has been actor Ashton Kutcher. The investors are committed to not charging for the teaching content, says von Ahn. </p> <p>After languages, he says, the next move may be to teach literacy, which can also have an immediate impact on employment opportunities. The ambition is to have a range of apps which teach a number of subjects intuitively, he says.</p> <p><br></p> <h2>List of languages</h2> <p>What can you learn? Speakers of different languages are taught new tongues separately so a Russian speaker can learn English or German, a Korean speaker can learn English, and a French speaker can learn Spanish and Italian. There are 39 courses in total with 23 on the way. English speakers can learn Spanish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Dutch, Irish, Swedish and Danish.<br></p>",

      "bodyText": "Policymakers in Britain and the eurozone should take note of an interesting event due to take place on Monday. The British government will finally redeem the war loan taken out in 1917 under the premiership of Lloyd George. That is to say, the last traces of that first world war debt will be repaid almost 100 years later. With debt, and deficits, one has to take the long-term view. This applied to the situation facing the coalition in 2010, and to the policymakers of the eurozone, who were also faced with the financial consequences of the 2007-09 banking crisis. The impact of the crisis was the peacetime equivalent of the devastation wreaked on public sector finances by war itself. Unfortunately, both in this country and the eurozone, an absurdly short-term view was taken of the situation, not least with regard to Greece and other peripheral eurozone economies. It is now well established that Chancellor Osborne has had to accommodate reality and \u201croll forward\u201d his targets for debt and deficit reduction. Even so, what he is proposing to do to public services if the Conservatives are re-elected is sending shivers down many a spine, as the consequences of a \u201clong-term plan\u201d that favours tax cuts at the expense of public services and national defence become more and more manifest. When issued in February 1917, the 5% war loan of 1929-47 accounted for just over 50% of the national debt. By March 1933, when appeals to patriotism by Chancellor Neville Chamberlain persuaded people to lose money by taking up a 3.5% coupon for the original 5% \u2013 times were hard! \u2013 the war loan accounted for just under 25% of the national debt. The actual amount to be redeemed on Monday is, at just over \u00a31.9bn, trifling by today\u2019s standards, but tomorrow is nevertheless a historic day. Appeals to patriotism were efficacious both with regard to the original issue in 1917 and to the conversion in 1932. But one wonders, for all his persuasive powers, what reaction Osborne would face if he were to appeal to today\u2019s electorate to accept a lower coupon. On the contrary, in a blatant pre-election bribe, our shameless chancellor has been offering the so-called \u201cgrey vote\u201d something for nothing with a new 4% bond issue at a time when most interest rates for savers are close to zero. As for the plight of the poor, Osborne glibly told the Today programme that the poor have been paying the price for the mistakes that led to the Great Recession. We know what is implied there: it was all Gordon Brown\u2019s fault, although, in fact, Brown made a major contribution to the fiscal and monetary stimulus that \u201csaved the world\u201d. At which point, a word of praise is due to that inveterate campaigner and Father of the House, Sir Peter Tapsell, who is one of the few Tory MPs to proclaim publicly that the recession was not caused by \u201cLabour\u2019s mess\u201d. Many years ago Tapsell entertained hopes \u2013 nurtured, I think, by Mrs Thatcher \u2013 that he would one day be chancellor himself. It was not to be. He became a national treasure instead. At all events, Harold Macmillan once said: \u201cHere we are, and the question is: where do we go from here?\u201d From the chancellor\u2019s point of view it is to next week\u2019s budget, and to an election victory, after which he would remain as chancellor and be the key negotiator, from the powerhouse of the Treasury, over the terms for \u201creform\u201d of the EU to Britain\u2019s satisfaction. I wonder. And notwithstanding the emphasis on more austerity to come, next week\u2019s budget is widely expected to contain more pre-election bribes. However, the record of pre-election budgets is mixed. Way back in 1964, Reginald Maudling produced a budget that was based on the assumption of a spring election, but prime minister Sir Alec Douglas Home decided to delay until autumn, and Maudling\u2019s \u201cshort-term plan\u201d went awry. In 1970, Roy Jenkins got caught out when he ignored an adviser\u2019s warning that an initially well-received budget could fall victim in the public prints to a rogue set of bad trade figures, and that is exactly what happened. He was subsequently blamed for supposedly contributing to the loss of the election. As befits my maverick old friend Nigel Lawson, his most memorable budget was not the one that preceded the 1987 election, which the Tories won in a canter, but his 1988 budget, in which he changed not just the British but the western world\u2019s attitude to acceptable levels of taxation by lowering the top rate from 60% to 40%. The Lawson boom ended in tears, but there is a sobering lesson for all in that, during Lawson\u2019s heyday, the public finances were in such good shape that senior officials even speculated privately about the chances of paying off the entire national debt. One thing we can be quite sure about next week: the budget will bear no resemblance to Denis Healey\u2019s last budget in 1979, when the Callaghan government lost a vote of confidence (on devolution). In the Commons, an election was called in a hurry, and the April budget was abandoned in favour of a \u201cways and means\u201d budget, agreed by both parties, that merely allowed the government to continue to collect taxes until the formation of the next government \u2013 which was where Thatcher came in. Oh, and by the way: the principal pre-election bribe comes not from the chancellor but from the market forces that have halved the price of oil.",
