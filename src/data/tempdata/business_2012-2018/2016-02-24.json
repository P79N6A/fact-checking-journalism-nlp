      "bodyText": "The International Monetary Fund has urged the UK to ease back on austerity should the economy slow further, as it warned finance ministers at the G20 summit in Shanghai to boost public spending on infrastructure to fuel global growth. In a report on the UK\u2019s economic outlook, the IMF said the risks of a more severe downturn were mounting as David Cameron\u2019s government battled sluggish productivity growth, a balance of payments deficit, high levels of household debt, and the forthcoming referendum on EU membership. In a mission statement drafted ahead of the G20 meeting in China later this week, it said that the power of monetary policy was beginning to wane and it was incumbent on those governments that could safely increase their spending to act together to boost global growth. The chancellor, George Osborne, and the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, are due to attend the conference. It said the Treasury needed to \u201cremain vigilant to the challenges ahead and to continue its policy efforts to promote growth and further boost resilience\u201d. IMF officials said the Treasury had done enough to stabilise the government\u2019s finances for it to embark on extra investment spending should GDP growth, which has slowed since last year, continue to falter. The Treasury declined to comment on the IMF report. The report said: \u201cFlexibility in the fiscal framework should be used to modify the pace of adjustment in the event of weaker demand growth.\u201d The warning follows an even tougher message from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) last week, which called on the UK to ease up on austerity and join a collective effort by the G20 to spend more on infrastructure projects to boost flagging growth. The Paris-based thinktank, which counts 34 of the world\u2019s wealthiest countries as members, said the G20 needed to recognise that low interest rates and money creation by central banks were no longer enough for a lasting recovery. The OECD\u2019s chief economist, Catherine Mann, said: \u201cWith governments in many countries currently able to borrow for long periods at very low interest rates, there is room for fiscal expansion to strengthen demand in a manner consistent with fiscal sustainability.\u201d The IMF echoed the OECD\u2019s call for a coordinated spending plan by rich nations to reverse a downturn in growth since last summer. It avoided singling out individual countries that should increase their spending, but officials warned that slowing global growth needed a different response from policymakers. The G20 was formed to accommodate the views of rich and developing world economies in the aftermath of the 2008 crash. Members include the US, the UK, China, India, Indonesia, Japan, Mexico and Russia. Tumbling oil prices and a dramatic slowing of the Chinese economy have spooked markets, which have slumped since last year. Fears that China, in a bid to increase its exports, is planning to devalue its currency have further undermined confidence in the ability of policymakers in the west to keep the recovery from the 2008 financial crash on track. The US economy has joined the slide in economic activity in recent months, triggering further concerns that global trade, which has already tumbled over the last 18 months, has further to fall. The IMF said the current low interest rates and trillions of dollars of quantitative easing provided by central banks should remain in place, but more action was needed from governments to prevent a bigger drop in global growth this year and next. \u201cA comprehensive approach is needed to reduce over-reliance on monetary policy,\u201d it said. \u201cIn particular, near-term fiscal policy should be more supportive where appropriate and provided there is fiscal space, especially through investment that boosts both the demand and the supply potential of the economy.\u201d IMF officials, concerned that without coordination some countries will boost spending only to suffer a rise in imports and a collapse in their currency, have concluded that the G20 needs to agree a plan of action that involves all members. Osborne has resisted attempts to coordinate spending by G20 countries to boost growth, preferring to focus on reducing the deficit in public spending to achieve a balanced budget by 2020. But the IMF said to support global activity and contain the risks of another financial crash, \u201cthe G20 must act now to implement forcefully the existing G20 growth strategies and plan for coordinated demand support using available fiscal space to boost public investment and complement structural reforms\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "The pound would fall 15%-20% against the dollar. The UK economy in 2017 would grow at only the half the rate currently expected. Inflation would be above 5% by the end of next year, creating a thumping policy headache for the Bank of England. This is HSBC\u2019s \u201ccentral case\u201d for what would happen if the UK votes to leave the European Union. Too alarmist? No, it all sounds entirely plausible. Note that HSBC was making short-term forecasts. The bank\u2019s analysts were careful to state that, regardless of the outcome of the referendum, the UK would remain a flexible and strong economy that would \u201ceventually achieve a strong economic performance in or out of the EU\u201d. The short-term impact, however, could hardly fail to be severe. Start with the currency effect. Sterling has already fallen 6% against the dollar this year as investors have woken up to the fact that Brexit is probably a one-third possibility. If 33% were to become 100% on 23 June then, yes, a 15%-20% fall for the pound sounds about right. And, after a sudden currency fall of that severity, there would almost certainly be an inflationary effect. As for economic slowdown, well, what else would you expect? It could take two years for the UK to negotiate its exit from the EU. The eventual terms of trade with big EU countries might turn out to be attractive (Germany would still want to flog us BMWs and fridges, after all) but businesses would delay some investment until they had seen the deal. That is especially so when the backdrop is a slowing global economy. In fact, HSBC\u2019s \u201csevere\u201d scenario, which points to the risk of outright recession, feels more likely than its \u201cbenign\u201d version that imagines only a small dip in growth in 2017. The point to remember is that the UK starts from a horrible position of having a large current account deficit that must be funded by flows of capital from overseas. That is a key vulnerability if foreign investors take fright after a vote for Brexit and demand higher returns to hold UK assets. Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, made the same point last month. \u201cThe global general environment has become much more febrile, much more volatile, and relying on the kindness of strangers is not optimal in that kind of environment \u2013 and that is the case when you are running a 4% to 4.5% current account deficit,\u201d he said. Carney and Bank officials, of course, are obliged to stay out of the nitty-gritty of the referendum debate as far as possible. There is no chance whatsoever of Threadneedle Street commenting on, let alone endorsing, projections like HSBC\u2019s. But it is a reasonable guess that its scenario assumptions are broadly similar. The moral for the leave camp should be obvious: there is no point trying to gloss over the short-term economic shock of a vote for Brexit. If the economic pitch is supposed to be greater long-term prosperity via trade deals with other parts of the world, then at least concede that possible gain would be preceded by definite pain. Honest outers have grasped the point and talk of short-term remedies, albeit in vague terms. The rest, though, prefer to ignore the problem. They had better have something stronger to say by June because, if the opinion polls indicate a close contest, a proper storm could be raging in currency markets. Far from reassuring stress tests Here\u2019s an exam we would all love to sit. Students will not be deemed to have passed or failed, because outsiders might judge the flops\u2019 prospects harshly. One of the trickiest subjects will not be included. And, by the way, some of the pupils from the bottom class will be excused. Yes, it\u2019s the 2016 version of the European Banking Authority\u2019s stress tests on banks. The big idea this time is that the banks won\u2019t be awarded a simple pass or fail mark. Regulators will instead use the results as \u201ca supervisory tool\u201d in order to avoid the problem of investors demanding that sub-grade banks fill their capital holes quickly. The effect of negative interest rates \u2013 the market\u2019s current obsession \u2013 won\u2019t be studied. And no Portuguese bank will be included. It would be wrong to say the EBA\u2019s stress test are a complete waste of time. There is merit in looking at how European banks could withstand \u201can abrupt reversal of compressed global risk premia\u201d and three other risks. But will any investor be reassured by a process that doesn\u2019t look robust and won\u2019t reach firm conclusions that all can see? It seems highly unlikely. In the current environment for banking shares, that\u2019s a problem.",

But it is a reasonable guess that its scenario assumptions are broadly similar.</p> <p>The moral for the leave camp should be obvious: there is no point trying to gloss over the short-term economic shock of a vote for Brexit. If the economic pitch is supposed to be greater long-term prosperity via trade deals with other parts of the world, then at least concede that possible gain would be preceded by definite pain.</p> <p>Honest outers <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2016/02/24/gerard-lyons-the-eu-is-like-the-titanic-and-we-need-to-jump-off/\">have grasped the point and talk of short-term remedies</a>, albeit in vague terms. The rest, though, prefer to ignore the problem. They had better have something stronger to say by June because, if the opinion polls indicate a close contest, a proper storm could be raging in currency markets.</p> <h2>Far from reassuring stress tests</h2> <p>Here\u2019s an exam we would all love to sit. Students will not be deemed to have passed or failed, because outsiders might judge the flops\u2019 prospects harshly. One of the trickiest subjects will not be included. And, by the way, some of the pupils from the bottom class will be excused.</p> <p>Yes, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/24/european-regulators-to-test-banks-strength-against-financial-shocks\">it\u2019s the 2016 version of the European Banking Authority\u2019s stress tests on banks</a>. The big idea this time is that the banks won\u2019t be awarded a simple pass or fail mark. Regulators will instead use the results as \u201ca supervisory tool\u201d in order to avoid the problem of investors demanding that sub-grade banks fill their capital holes quickly. The effect of negative interest rates \u2013 the market\u2019s current obsession \u2013 won\u2019t be studied. And no Portuguese bank will be included.</p> <p>It would be wrong to say the EBA\u2019s stress test are a complete waste of time. There is merit in looking at how European banks could withstand \u201can abrupt reversal of compressed global risk premia\u201d and three other risks. But will any investor be reassured by a process that doesn\u2019t look robust and won\u2019t reach firm conclusions that all can see? It seems highly unlikely. In the current environment for banking shares, that\u2019s a problem.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A developer behind a luxury London housing project has warned of challenging conditions in the capital\u2019s property market, amid growing concerns of a supply glut in prime homes. Capital &amp; Counties (Capco), which is leading the regeneration of the Earls Court exhibition centre in west London, has reported a slowdown in sales of luxury flats on the site. It blamed the weak demand on increasing supply of high-end housing across the capital and a new stamp duty surcharge on second homes, which comes into force in April. Flats in the Lillie Square development are being sold for more than \u00a31,500 per sq ft, and two-bedroom flats are going on the market for more than \u00a31.3m. The first phase of the project sold quickly when it launched in 2014, with 85% reserved in the first five weeks, but phase two, which launched in September 2015, is taking longer to sell. \u201cThe residential sales market in London experienced challenging conditions towards the end of 2015 as a result of increasing supply, particularly in emerging locations, and regulatory intervention which has impacted demand,\u201d said Capco\u2019s chief executive, Ian Hawksworth. \u201cWhile we remain confident in Lillie Square, the rate of sales has reduced compared to 2014, which reflects these challenges in the residential market.\u201d The firm has not registered an increase in sales for the development since November \u2013 the same month that George Osborne announced the higher tax rate on investment properties and other second homes. A total of 7,500 homes are included in the master plan for Earls Court, ranging from affordable homes to luxury apartments. Capital &amp; Counties\u2019 share price closed 8.2% down at 315p on Wednesday. Lower down the UK housing market, the stamp duty surcharge is also having an effect, according to the British Bankers\u2019 Association, as borrowers attempt to secure mortgages ahead of the changes. The BBA said 80,285 mortgages were approved in January \u2013 the highest number for two years. Of these, 47,509 were approved for home purchases, as opposed to remortgages \u2013 an increase of 27% on the figure for January 2015. Richard Woolhouse, chief economist at the BBA, said: \u201cThe start of the year has seen a significant rise in mortgage borrowing. \u201cIt seems that this has been driven, in part, by borrowers looking to get ahead of the increases in stamp duty for buy-to-let and second-home buyers scheduled to come into effect in April.\u201d Estate agents have reported keen interest from property investors trying to buy ahead of the stamp duty changes, which will see the rate paid on second homes increased by three percentage points. Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight, said this could push up values. \u201cThis could well exert upward pressure on house prices in the near term,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "Talks to clinch a \u00a320bn deal between the London Stock Exchange (LSE) and Deutsche B\u00f6rse are continuing, to set out the new management for the enlarged organisation and to establish where it will be based. There have been conflicting reports about the role of Carsten Kengeter, the German banker who has been running the Frankfurt-based exchange for only nine months. One suggested he would be chief executive while another said he would be chairman. Neither exchange would elaborate on their negotiations after being forced to admit on Tuesday that they had begun their third attempt at a tie-up in 16 years. At that point they confirmed they were embarking on a \u201cmerger of equals\u201d in which both companies would share control of the boardroom, retain their separate brands and operate under a holding company structure. According to the Financial Times, the holding company would be based in London - which might appease any lingering anxiety that the German exchange was gaining greater control of the business. Deutsche B\u00f6rse is to own 54.4% of the merged holding company, compared with LSE\u2019s 45.6%. Under this scenario, the chief executive of the LSE, Xavier Rolet, would leave the enlarged exchange, which would be the third largest in the world in terms of stock market value. Rolet took over in 2009 and embarked on a merger spree, and has been credited with help fuelling growth at the LSE. The timing of the news of the potential deal \u2013 just days after the UK government called a referendum on the UK\u2019s continued membership of the European Union \u2013 is expected to arouse political interest, particularly if the UK votes on 23 June to leave. The head of the finance committee in the German lower house of parliament told Reuters on Wednesday that the deal would help bolster the country\u2019s position as a financial centre. \u201cI would have nothing against it if it happens,\u201d Ingrid Arndt-Brauer said. \u201cI think this would have advantages for Germany as a financial centre. It would gain in importance.\u201d Both sides are braced for scrutiny of the transaction, not only from politicians but also from the competition authorities, which have prevented Deutsche B\u00f6rse\u2019s expansionary plans in the past. \u201cOpportunities are rife for cost savings, but the major test lies in the regulatory hurdle, which, combined with added scrutiny in the context of Brexit, places the onus on the two companies to make a compelling case for the deal over the coming months,\u201d said Peter Gray, partner and head of financial services at mergers and acquisitions firm Cavendish. When they confirmed they were in advanced talks, they described their aim as being to create \u201can industry-defining combination\u201d that would not only allow trading of shares but also operate a vast behind-the-scenes clearing house which would guarantee billions of trades. \u201cThe combined exchange would be the third largest globally using current market values. We would view a merger of equals between the Deutsche B\u00f6rse and LSE positively. For the most part, the two firms operate complementary businesses which provides a strong strategic rationale to the deal,\u201d said Michael Werner, an analyst at UBS. The exchanges first agreed to merge in 2000, before a rival bid for the LSE from Sweden\u2019s OM Gruppen scuppered the deal, which was then rejected anyway. The LSE then rejected a formal \u00a31.3bn offer from Deutsche B\u00f6rse in January 2005. Investor bodies are also likely to keep a close eye on the transaction. Liz Field, chief executive of the Wealth Management Association, said: \u201cThe key priority for WMA and its members when there are any proposed mergers or takeovers involving the London Stock Exchange is to ensure that retail clients can continue to trade equities and other listed financial assets as cost-effectively and efficiently as possible. \u201cWe have no reason to doubt that this will be jeopardised if the LSE and Deutsche B\u00f6rse were to merge, but we will of course be monitoring any developments closely.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The boss of Tata Steel Europe has jumped ship to a German firm, in the middle of sale talks that could determine the future of thousands of UK jobs. The company, part of Indian conglomerate Tata, said Dr Karl K\u00f6hler had decided to take up a \u201csenior leadership position\u201d with an unnamed private industrial firm in Germany. While K\u00f6hler will \u201cremain available to Tata Steel for a short period\u201d as an advisor, his departure comes at a sensitive time for the business. Tata Steel Europe is in talks with investment group Greybull Capital over a possible sale of its Long Products division, which employs 5,000 people in the UK. The talks will decide the fate of the division\u2019s hub in Scunthorpe, as well as steel mills in the north-east and Scotland. With negotiations on the sale still under way, steelworkers\u2019 union Community expressed concerns about the timing of K\u00f6hler\u2019s exit. \u201cThis change in leadership comes at an extremely difficult time for the UK steel industry, so it\u2019s important that the new team ... reaffirms the focus on creating a sustainable future for steel making in the UK,\u201d said Roy Rickhuss, the general secretary. K\u00f6hler will be replaced by the chief technical officer, Hans Fischer, who will not have a seat on the board of parent company Tata Steel. Instead he will report to the group executive director, Koushik Chatterjee, who will provide \u201cadvice and guidance\u201d on the company\u2019s European operations. Community said it wanted further explanation from Tata on the new leadership structure. \u201cIt is a concern that Tata Steel Europe\u2019s CEO will no longer have a seat on the Tata Steel board in India. We will be seeking further clarification on this decision,\u201d said Rickhuss. K\u00f6hler has led Tata Steel Europe during a period in which the UK steel industry has been ravaged by job cuts and closures, prompting the company to cut more than 2,000 jobs over the past 18 months. Industry figures have blamed Chinese firms for dumping cheap steel on the European market to make up for an economic slowdown that has reduced domestic demand in China. K\u00f6hler joined 5,000 steelworkers on a march in Brussels this month, calling on European leaders to do more to protect the region\u2019s steel firms. \u201cThe last six years have been a challenging journey of change for Tata Steel in Europe as it dealt with unprecedented market conditions,\u201d said K\u00f6hler. \u201cI believe the new leadership ... will continue the journey of making the company stronger in the challenging times the European steel industry is facing.\u201d Tata Steel Europe declined to reveal the name of the company K\u00f6hler will be joining, although it is not thought to be a competitor in the steel industry. One industry source said K\u00f6hler\u2019s sudden departure was a surprise given the perilous state of UK steel, adding that the announcement had \u201ccome out of the blue\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "European regulators will test banks\u2019 financial strength against two years of economic contraction, falling commodity and property prices and further regulatory fines as fears mount over lenders\u2019 ability to withstand shocks. The European Banking Authority said on Wednesday its annual stress test programme \u2013 which covers UK banks Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds Banking Group and Royal Bank of Scotland \u2013 would assess banks\u2019 resilience when faced with a slowing global economy. The main risk categories the EBA will test are: falling prices of assets such as commodities and property, weak profits for banks, risk of debt default by countries and companies, and strains in money market funds and other parts of the financial system outside the banking sector. Specific risks within those categories include potential fines for misconduct, an unexpectedly sharp slowdown in China and other emerging markets, sovereign debt default and deflation. Under the EBA\u2019s \u201cadverse scenario\u201d, the European Union\u2019s economy would contract 1.2% this year and 1.3% next year before expanding by 0.7% in 2018. The tests cover 51 banks making up 70% of Europe\u2019s banking system: 37 in the eurozone and 14 outside the single currency bloc. The EBA said that, unlike in previous years, its tests would not pass or fail banks and no capital thresholds had been set. The EBA said in general it believed banks had enough loss-absorbing capital to withstand potential shocks. The EBA said: \u201cThe objective of the crisis stress tests was to identify possible capital shortfalls and require immediate recapitalisation actions. As banks have now moved to a more steady-state setting, the aim of the 2016 exercise is rather to assess remaining vulnerabilities and understand the impact of hypothetical adverse market dynamics on banks.\u201d No banks from Portugal will be subject to the tests because they are not deemed systemically important even though Portuguese banks are seen as weak. There was also surprise that the impact of negative interest rates, one of the big fears for the sector this year, would not play a big part in the tests. The risk of Britain voting to leave the EU on 23 June is not included either. Bank share prices have tumbled this year as investors have worried about risks such as rising bad debts and lower revenues, as the global economy slows and central banks experiment with negative interest rates. Other perceived threats include further big regulatory fines and the effect of plunging prices for oil and other commodities. The rout of bank shares has prompted companies such as Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse to proclaim their own financial strength. One of the concerns is the use of negative interest rates \u2013 when a central bank charges commercial banks for depositing money with it. The move, adopted by the Bank of Japan last month, is meant to encourage banks to lend money to benefit the wider economy, but the largely untested method can also dent banks\u2019 profits. The EBA has not included negative interest rates in its general scenario for the stress tests, but they are among various market risk shocks that are under consideration, it said. The EBA said banks would be required to report on their financial strength to national regulators based on their position at the end of 2015, with a report due in the third quarter of this year.",

IMF chief Christine Lagarde told CNN: \u201cUncertainty is bad in and of itself. No economic player likes uncertainty. They don\u2019t invest, they don\u2019t hire, they don\u2019t make decisions in times of uncertainty.\u201d Lagarde also argued that Britain had benefited from trade and financial ties with the EU, and from migration of workers back and forth, though she sidestepped calculating the damage Brexit might cause. \u201cMy hunch \u2026 is that it is bound to be a negative on all fronts.

But the IMF\u2019s annual health check said \u201cthe relatively positive outlook is subject to risks and uncertainties\u201d, including a global slowdown, sluggish productivity growth, a large trade deficit, still-high levels of household debt, and the forthcoming referendum on EU membership.

      "bodyText": "Ryanair is to actively campaign for Britain to remain in the EU, branding its planes with pro-Europe slogans, as it warned UK fares could rise after a vote to leave. The chief executive of the budget carrier said Europe had allowed Britons to enjoy affordable holidays through deregulating the airline industry, and that Ryanair would invest less in the UK if it were outside the EU. Michael O\u2019Leary promised to \u201cbore everybody to death\u201d by repeating a pro-EU message until the June referendum. His company plans to back the remain campaign in the EU referendum with advertising and by lobbying its customers. \u201cOne of the great things that most people in the UK will have benefited from is deregulation. Europe is the one [thing] that has delivered low fare air travel and cheaper holidays for British citizens,\u201d O\u2019Leary said.

O\u2019Leary warned that the idea of being part of Europe outside the EU was worse than staying in. \u201cLook at Norway. You have to sign up for the single market \u2013 you will still pay and still obey, but have absolutely no influence on the rule-making and reform of Europe.\u201d Speaking in London on Wednesday, the 54-year-old Irishman said: \u201cAs the UK\u2019s largest airline, Ryanair is absolutely clear that the UK economy and its future growth prospects are stronger as a member of the European Union than they are outside of the EU. \u201cRyanair, our people, and I hope the vast majority of our customers will all work together over the coming months to help deliver a resounding yes vote on 23 June.\u201d The budget airline employs more than 3,000 people in the UK and flies more than 35 million passengers between the UK and Europe each year. O\u2019Leary said Brexit \u201cisn\u2019t going to be armageddon\u201d but said foreign investment would decline, and he added: \u201cWe as an airline will invest faster in other European companies such as the Czech Republic and Poland.\u201d But he said air fares risked rising faster in an independent UK, with taxes such as air passenger duty likely to increase as the economy stuttered after exit. He said that the government\u2019s handling of airport expansion, by ruling only one extra runway could be built in the south-east, would limit competition and drive up fares. \u201cThe UK government will continue to push up the cost of air travel \u2026 I would fear more from UK bureaucracy than EU bureaucracy.\u201d He said the leave campaign was \u201cselling an untruth to the British people\u201d \u2013 that they would be free of European regulation and would not have to pay to be part of the single market. \u201cBoris and George Galloway will continue to make merry in their political best interest, that\u2019s what they do, but we\u2019re businesses and we employ people and we don\u2019t want to make footballs out of these issues,\u201d O\u2019Leary added. Ryanair also announced plans to grow its traffic out of London by 10% this year as it launched its busiest winter schedule, with five new European routes and extended services to 18 destinations from Stansted, Gatwick and Luton. It expects to fly 23.6 million passengers, or about 20% of its total, from the London airports.",

    "webTitle": "IMF chief Lagarde warns against Brexit, as pound hits new seven-year low - as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Time for a quick recap. Growing anxiety over the UK\u2019s EU referendum has driven sterling down to a new seven year low. The pound fell as low as $1.3879, as cabinet ministers clashed over the legal strength of Britain\u2019s new deal with Europe. Investors are also scrambling to protect themselves against fresh volatility ahead of the June referendum. The cost of insuring against sterling volatility has hit its highest level since 2011. IMF chief Christine Lagarde has warned that Britain, and Europe, would bother suffer if the UK quits the EU. She fears that the uncertainty will hurt growth, at a time when the world economy is already fragile. The Fund also cited June\u2019s referendum as a potential threat to the UK\u2019s recovery. Several other City bosses have warned against Brexit. Ryanair, the budget airline, has even pledged to campaign actively to keep Britain inside the EU. HSBC has predicted that the pound would slump by 20% in the event of a Brexit vote. It also warned that growth would fall sharply, with the housing market and the banking sector also vulnerable. A poll of City economists has also predicted that the pound will tumble further if the Out campaign wins. On top of Lagarde\u2019s remarks, the IMF has also cited the Brexit referendum as a risk to the UK recovery. In a note issued today, the Fund took a broadly positive view of Britain\u2019s economy. It said \u201cconsiderable progress has been achieved in the post-crisis repair of the UK economy\u201d, citing the halving of the deficit and the steady fall in unemployment. The Fund also expects the UK to keep growing, saying: With the output gap now nearly closed, growth is expected to average near its potential rate of around 2\u00bc percent over the medium term, with inflation rising slowly from its current low levels to the 2 percent target by end-2017. However, this benign baseline is subject to risks, it adds --including the threat of global financial turmoil, the UK\u2019s current account deficit, and the possibility that productivity remains weak. Plus the Brexit threat. As the Fund puts it: Uncertainty associated with the outcome of the forthcoming referendum on EU membership could also weigh on the outlook. Continued efforts are needed to complete the post-crisis repair, promote growth, and further bolster resilience. Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund, has just weighed in on the EU referendum. And she\u2019s not a fan of Brexit, warning that Britain and the EU would both suffer. Speaking to CNN, Lagarde said: \u201cUncertainty is bad in and of itself. No economic player likes uncertainty. They don\u2019t invest, they don\u2019t hire, they don\u2019t make decisions in times of uncertainty.\u201d Lagarde also argued that Britain had benefitted from trade and financial ties with EU, and from migration of workers back and forth. She didn\u2019t say how much damage would be caused by Brexit, though. \u201cMy hunch ... is that it is bound to be a negative on all fronts. For those that stay, because there are fewer of them, and for those who go, because they lose the benefit of [that] facilitation of exchange.\u201d Yuk. Two pieces of rather grim economic data just landed from America, showing that its economy may be weakening. First, data firm Markit has reported that activity across the US services sector is contracting, for the first time in 14 months. Its PMI reading, which monitors thousands of firms, has fallen to 49.8 - just below the stagnation point. Analysts expected a reading of 53.5. Secondly... new home sales across the US slumped by over 9% in January to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 494,000. Marketwatch has more details: January\u2019s figure was the lowest since October and missed forecasts of a 520,000 annual rate from economists surveyed by MarketWatch. It was 5.2% lower than the same period a year ago. The US stock market is following Europe lower, as Wall Street trading begins. The Dow Jones industrial average has lost 1.1%, or 184 points. at 16,247 points. Investors are disappointed to see the oil price sliding today - US crude has lost 3.7% to $30.69 per barrel, after Saudi Arabia dismissed the possibility of a production cut. Ryanair is already cracking on with its campaign to keep Britain in the EU: Ryanair has a somewhat patchy reputation for customer service - despite a recent commitment to be nicer to the punters. So it\u2019s not clear that O\u2019Leary\u2019s intervention will have a dramatic impact on the referendum. At least, not the way he hopes.... Breaking news: Ryanair, the budget airline, has called for a \u201cBig Yes vote\u201d to stay in the European Union, in the June referendum. Ryanair also says it will \u201cactively campaign\u201d for Britain to Remain in the EU. In a statement released to the City, the airline says it supports Britain\u2019s membership of the EU because: this will lead to more UK jobs &amp; better economic growth EU open skies has transformed UK tourism &amp; job creation prospects the free movement of goods &amp; services has made the UK one of Europe\u2019s most competitive &amp; best performing economies David Cameron\u2019s negotiated reforms protect Sterling, limits immigration and closer Union, while reducing bureaucracy foreign inward investment in the UK will be lost to Ireland &amp; Germany if the UK leaves Europe CEO Michael O\u2019Leary says that Ryanair believes the UK\u2019s economy and its future growth prospects are better inside the EU, not outside. Leaving Europe won\u2019t save the UK money or red tape because like Norway the UK will still have to contribute to Europe, and obey its rules if it wants to continue to trade freely with Europe, so it\u2019s clear that UK voters should vote Yes to Europe and Yes to the reformed Europe, that David Cameron has delivered. Ryanair, our people and I hope the vast majority of our customers, will all work together over the coming months to help deliver a resounding Yes vote on June 23rd.\u201d However, O\u2019Leary has also said that Brexit wouldn\u2019t drive up air fares.... The London stock market is falling in sympathy with the pound. The FTSE 100 is now down by 95 points at 5867, a one-week low. Conner Campbell of Spreadex, the City trading firm, says a volley of Brexit warnings have helped to push shares down. Warnings from a variety of sources, including HSBC (here), Sir Martin Sorrell (here), Airbus (here) and hedge-fund Man Group (here), about the pound-plaguing, growth-sapping issues the UK would suffer if the \u2018out\u2019 vote prevails in June\u2019s referendum have only exacerbated the nascent jitters that appeared during yesterday\u2019s trading, helping send the FTSE nearly 80 points lower. If anything the Eurozone indices were even nervier than their UK counterpart, the DAX and CAC plunging 230 and 90 points respectively. Of course the main causality in the increasingly heightened debate over Britain\u2019s place in the EU is sterling, the currency hitting levels not seen since March 2009 The pound is continuing to slide today, as Conservative ministers clash over the EU referendum. It just fell below $1.39 for the first time since March 2009, a drop of 0.9% or 1.2 cents since last night. Sterling has hit a 16-month low against the euro too; at \u20ac1.2659. That means one euro is now worth 79.06p. We can\u2019t put ALL the blame on the EU referendum. Traders are also calculating that the Bank of England may cut interest rates to fresh record lows this year, given the weakness in the global economy. But Alex Edwards, currency analyst at UKForex, says Brexit is a major factor. He explains: Brexit headlines are hitting sterling hard, with talk of a Cabinet split weighing heavily on the pound. It\u2019s going to be a very bumpy ride for sterling in the run up to June\u2019s referendum, and we can expect new lows and increased instability as the rhetoric heightens, polls are released and rumours abound.\u201d That cabinet split involves Michael Gove, the justice secretary (and Out campaigner). Gove claimed this morning that the deal agreed between Britain and Brussels isn\u2019t legally binding as it hasn\u2019t (yet) been included in an EU treaty. Attorney general Jeremy Wright has now weighed in, saying Gove is wrong. But some legal experts have suggested Gove has a point. Our Politics Live blog has all the action: Britain\u2019s most powerful marketing and advertising boss has warned that the EU referendum is spooking his clients, and could force him to move some operations abroad. Sir Martin Sorrell, the head of WPP, says Britain faces \u201ca period of unstability and uncertainty\u201d ahead of June\u2019s vote, and confidence is already being hit. Speaking on Bloomberg TV a moment ago, Sorrell said he shared concerns over the extent of EU bureaucracy. However, he is still worried about the consequences of an Out vote, calling Brexit a \u201cblack hole\u201d. Sorrell said: I think it is really important to be inside the tent, trying to reform and change Europe, rather than being outside the tent in a completely unknown situation, where it will be very hard for several years to work out Britain\u2019s role in the world. WPP\u2019s clients are \u201cat best neutral, and at worst highly negative\u201d about the referendum, he continued. Clients will be postponing investment decisions, postponing trade decisions and considering alternative scenarios - like we all are - about what we will do if the country decides to leave the EU. So are you considering moving your HQ, asks Bloomberg\u2019s Francine Lacqua. We are examining the implications of a negative vote, Sorrell replies. He suggests that the terms of Britain\u2019s relationship with Europe would be critical, saying: The thing that worries me most is that our biggest trading block, whether we like it or not, is Europe. Its GDP is roughly equivalent to the United States...If access to that is restricted, or limited, that will exacerbate the issues. German is WPP\u2019s 4th largest market, while France is the 7th. They, along with Italy and Spain, are all \u201cpretty critical\u201d, said Sorrell, concluding: Any structural change [in Britain\u2019s relationship with Europe] will force us to look very closely at how we are organised. The Brexit uncertainty isn\u2019t helping the mood in the City today. Europe\u2019s stock markets are all in the red this morning, as investors get another bout of jitteriness over the global economy. The oil price has fallen by 2%, after the latest rumours of an OPEC production cut were punctured yesterday. In London, the FTSE 100 (the largest blue-chip companies) has lost 73 points or 1.2%, dragged down by mining stocks. Ipek Ozkardeskaya of London Capital Markets says the bears are on control this morning. All sectors are trading in the red. Materials and energy stocks lead losses in London given that oil and commodity prices face rising selling pressure. US oil gave back the $2 it gained yesterday as Iran called the Saudi-Russia agreement to freeze production \u2018ridiculous\u2019 and Saudi Oil Minister made it clear for everybody: there will be no such thing as a production cut. Hence the possibility of a slide to $25 could be kept on the table. Andy Scott, economist at currency firm HiFX, confirms that the pound is suffering from Brexit fears again. He says: \u201cSterling fell to a fresh 7-year low against the Dollar on Wednesday, below the psychologically important $1.40 level, as polls remained tight over the outcome of June\u2019s EU referendum. With investor sentiment souring again after oil prices retraced gains made at the beginning of the week, Sterling once again came under pressure due to the risk of a \u2018Brexit\u2019.\u201d Scott reckons that the pound could soon fall towards $1.35, last seen in the early months of 2009 during the financial crisis. Airbus, the planemaker, says it doesn\u2019t believe its UK operations would benefit from Britain leaving the EU. Tom Enders, chief executive of Airbus, told a news conference this morning that: \u201cIf Britain leaves, I cannot imagine that this would have positive consequences for our competitiveness in Britain.\u201d Some firms are treading cautiously over the Brexit question, for fear of upsetting customers [the supermarkets have been particularly tight-lipped]. But Airbus - which is headquartered in France - is less reticent. Yesterday it hosted senior Labour MP Alan Johnson, who gave a speech warning that 50,000 engineering jobs could be lost if Britain quits the EU. Here\u2019s another slide from today\u2019s HSBC\u2019s note on the UK\u2019s EU referendum: The pound has just fallen to a new seven-year low, hitting $1.3926 against the US dollar. Investment bank HSBC has issued a stark warning about the impact of Brexit on the UK economy. In a new research note, HSBC predicts that the pound would tumble, and the economy would grind to a near-standstill next year. It also fears that banks would face new pain, and that London\u2019s property market would suffer too. Here\u2019s the key points: Sterling could lose 20% of its value against the US dollar. That would send the pound towards $1.10, a level not seen since 1985 (the year of the Miners\u2019 Strike, and the launch of the battery-powered C5 vehicle). UK growth would slow sharply. HSBC sees 1.5 percentage points being knocked off the GDP growth rate in 2017. That would wipe out almost all the expected growth. Inflation would spike. Imported goods would be more expensive, due to the weak pound, and the Bank of England would be reluctant to raise interest rates. HSBC says: Our central case in the event of a vote for Brexit is that uncertainty grips the economy. This could take around 1.0-1.5 percentage points off the GDP growth rate by the second half of 2017. This would push our 2017 growth forecast, currently 2.3%, into the 0.8-1.3% range. And if sterling were to fall by around 15-20% (as our currency strategists predict), UK inflation could rise by up to 5 percentage points (our end-2017 inflation forecast is 1.8%). In the event of a vote for Brexit, concerns about deflation could swiftly give way to worries of stagflation. HSBC\u2019s analysts also predict that some UK firms could struggle to attract qualified staff from overseas if the Out campaign win, as this chart shows: The cost of protecting against sharp swings in the value of the pound has jumped, to the highest level since 2011. The move suggests heightened concern over the strength of sterling, and the possibility of significant volatility over the next few months. Reuters has the details. Six-month implied sterling/dollar volatility, derived from options that cover the June 23 referendum date, hit 13.35% on Wednesday as investors sought protection against further big falls in the pound. That was its highest since September 2011. A leading City hedge fund manager has warned that Britain could face serious repercussions if it leaves the EU. Manny Roman, chief executive of the London-listed hedge fund Man Group, cautioned that: \u201cWhilst it is hard to say exactly what the impact would be, the uncertainty and potential negative consequences of Brexit for the UK\u2019s economy should not be underestimated.\u201d FastFT has more details. Worth noting that the pound is holding up better against other currencies, rather than the US dollar. Sterling is only at a two-year low on a trade-weighed basis (against a basket of currencies). That\u2019s partly due to the relative weakness of the euro, which is likely to also suffer from a Brexit. Jeremy Cook of FX firm World First also fears the pound will keep falling: He told clients this morning: There are a lot of news pieces floating around this morning asking how low can the pound actually fall? \u201cHow low can X go?\u201d pieces are normally a sign of a bottom but you\u2019d be a braver man than I to begin betting on an immediate bounce back for the pound. There\u2019s a few reasons why Brexit would be bad for the pound: The uncertainty and disruption of an Out vote would hit growth. That would mean interest rates would remain at record lows for even longer, meaning a lower return for holding sterling. Some investors would sell UK assets and pull out of the country. These capital outflows would weaken the pound (as those investors would be exchanging sterling-denominated assets for another currency). Brexit might intensify concerns over Britain\u2019s current account deficit - the gap between what Britain buys and sells to the rest of the world. Currently, that deficit is financed by borrowing, and by selling assets to foreigners. A weak pound isn\u2019t a complete disaster, though. It should give a boost to exporters and the UK tourism industry, and would also push up the cost of imported goods. A poll of City economists has found that most expect the pound to suffer steep losses if Britain votes to leave the EU: This morning\u2019s selloff means the pound has now lost four cents, or over 3%, since David Cameron secured his new settlement with the EU on Friday night. Many analysts believe it could keep falling, perhaps as low as $1.30. That would take the pound through its 2009 low ($1.35), to hit its lowest level since the sterling crisis in 1985, in the middle of Margaret Thatcher\u2019s premiership. Nick Kounis, head of macro research at ABN Amro Bank NV in Amsterdam, has predicted that the pound would slump to $1.20 if the British public choose to exit the EU. He told Bloomberg that: \u201cA vote for Brexit would hit sterling hard.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Fear and uncertainty over Britain\u2019s upcoming EU referendum continue to loom over the City today. The pound has taken another dive - dropping below the $1.40 mark for the first time since March 2009. At one point, sterling was as low as $1.3962, on concerns that the Out campaign will win on 23 June. Chris Weston of IG reports that international investors have been very keen to buy and sell \u2018cable\u2019 -- City jargon for trading the sterling/US dollar. The Remain campaign is tipped to win in June, but the possibility of a shock result is causing angst in the international markets. Weston explains: The market is pricing in around a 40% chance of \u2018Brexit\u2019 and the bookies slightly less. However, if we do see an exit, it promises to get very messy indeed, specifically given the current positioning within the Tory party and the fact the party will effectively be all over the place. Yesterday, Bank of England governor Mark Carney warned that there was heavy demand for protection against the pound tumbling further this summer. We\u2019re expecting to hear from budget airline Ryanair about the Brexit issue today, at a noon briefing. And European stock markets are expected to dip, adding to yesterday\u2019s losses. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100, which lost 75 points on Tuesday, is tipped to lose another 16 points. We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day.....",

The business lobby group said its members in the retail industry were planning to slightly scale back investment spending this year after two quarters when firms expected to raise their capital outlay. Retailers enjoyed a strong January, according to official figures, after cutting prices to clear stock, with sales rising at the fastest rate in two years.

Retailers were gloomy despite a majority, including wholesalers, reporting that sales in February were up on the same month last year and that they expected an improvement in business conditions, which indicated higher orders and profitability over the next three months.

Alistair Cox, chief executive of Hays, reported pre-tax profit up 7% to \u00a382.4m in the second half of 2015, on the back of 8% like-for-like growth in fees to \u00a3396.9m. Fees in the UK were up a more modest 3% and Cox said this was partly down to weakness in the public sector. \u201cWe saw a slowdown in the use of temp workers in public sector amid the caps that have been introduced on salaries for workers in the health service,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople are taking themselves out of the labour pool because the salary is not commensurate with unsociable hours they\u2019re being asked to work.\u201d Rates paid to agency staff were capped in November in an attempt to reduce costs. Cox added that weakness in the public sector had also weighed on results in Scotland, where fees bucked the trend of increases across the UK. Fee income was also down 3% in the north, compared with growth in London, the Midlands and the north-west. Cox said fee growth in the UK had slowed during the half \u201cas increased global uncertainty impacted sentiment\u201d. But he added that the slowdown did not not necessarily signal an impending employment crisis. \u201cI don\u2019t see any reason why it would be prolonged subdued environment,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople still want to change jobs and clients still need the right people. The movement of labour is going to continue.\u201d Many firms had embarked on recruitment drives as the UK emerged from recession and the market had now taken a \u201cpause for breath\u201d amid economic uncertainty, Cox said. He added that Hays did not have a view on whether Britain should leave the EU. Hays\u2019 performance was in line with expectations, with the increase in operating profit allowing for a 5% rise in the half-year dividend to 0.91p.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The pound tumbled below $1.39 for the first time in seven years on Wednesday as analysts warned that a vote to quit the European Union would severely damage the UK\u2019s growth prospects. Sterling dropped to $1.3883 and also suffered against the euro after HSBC issued one of the starkest warnings yet of the dire consequences from a Brexit vote. Analysts at the bank said sterling could lose another 20% of its value against the US dollar, pushing its value towards $1.10 \u2013 a level not seen since 1985 when the miners\u2019 strike was in full swing. A steep rise in the cost of imports following the currency\u2019s collapse would send inflation spiralling, forcing the Bank of England to raise interest rates. The analysts warned that the ensuing turmoil would knock 1.5 percentage points off GDP growth in 2017, losing almost all the 2.3% growth rate the Bank of England expects should the status quo be maintained. \u201cOur central case in the event of a vote for Brexit is that uncertainty grips the economy. This could take around 1.0-1.5 percentage points off the GDP growth rate by the second half of 2017. This would push our 2017 growth forecast, currently 2.3%, into the 0.8-1.3% range,\u201d the analysts said. \u201cAnd if sterling were to fall by around 15-20% (as our currency strategists predict), UK inflation could rise by up to 5 percentage points (our end-2017 inflation forecast is 1.8%). In the event of a vote for Brexit, concerns about deflation could swiftly give way to worries of stagflation. Last year analysts at Morgan Stanley said a Brexit vote would expose the country to a \u201creferendum shock\u201d and a \u201cflirt with recession\u201d. Analysis by the Centre for Economic Performance at the London School of Economics has also dismissed the Leave campaign analysis that the UK economy would be unaffected. It considered an \u201coptimistic scenario\u201d with small increases in trade costs between the UK and the EU, and a \u201cpessimistic scenario\u201d with larger increases. \u201cIn the optimistic case, Brexit reduces UK income by 1.1% of GDP. In the pessimistic case, UK income falls by 3.1%, or \u00a350bn a year.\u201d More business leaders lined up on Thursday to voice their concerns that the UK economy will be a significant casualty of a decision to leave the EU, including Sir Martin Sorrell, chief executive of the advertising firm WPP. Sorrell said Britain faces \u201ca period of unstability and uncertainty\u201d ahead of June\u2019s vote, and confidence is already being hit. Speaking on Bloomberg TV, he said he shared concerns over the extent of EU bureaucracy. However, he is still worried about the consequences of an out vote, calling Brexit a \u201cblack hole\u201d. The continent is fertile ground for WPP, which owns the agencies Ogilvy &amp; Mather and Young &amp; Rubicam, and counts Germany as its fourth largest market and France as its seventh largest. \u201cI think it is really important to be inside the tent, trying to reform and change Europe, rather than being outside the tent in a completely unknown situation, where it will be very hard for several years to work out Britain\u2019s role in the world,\u201d he said. WPP\u2019s clients are \u201cat best neutral, and at worst highly negative\u201d about the referendum, he added. \u201cClients will be postponing investment decisions, postponing trade decisions and considering alternative scenarios - like we all are - about what we will do if the country decides to leave the EU.\u201d Tom Enders, chief executive of Airbus, the planemaker, said he didn\u2019t believe its UK operations would benefit from Britain leaving the EU. He told a news conference: \u201cIf Britain leaves, I cannot imagine that this would have positive consequences for our competitiveness in Britain.\u201d On Tuesday Airbus - which is headquartered in France - hosted senior Labour MP Alan Johnson, as he claimed that 50,000 engineering jobs could be lost if Britain quits the EU. Man Group chief executive Manny Roman also weighed in to the debate: \u201cWhilst it is hard to say exactly what the impact would be, the uncertainty and potential negative consequences of Brexit for the UK\u2019s economy should not be underestimated.\u201d",

    "sectionName": "Business", 
    "webTitle": "Ofcom review to decide future of BT Openreach", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Ofcom is due to announce the initial conclusions of its Strategic Review of Digital Communications on Thursday, examining competition, investment and innovation in broadband, mobile and landline services. The most eagerly awaited part of the review is the regulator\u2019s recommendation on the future of BT Openreach. What is Openreach? Openreach is the division of BT that owns the fibre and copper wires that run from the local telephone exchange to homes and businesses. This part of the network is often called the \u201clast mile\u201d but in total it amounts to 76 million miles of cables snaking their way through Britain. Openreach\u2019s customers are the 537-odd service providers - the likes of Sky and TalkTalk - who sell telephone and internet services to households. It was established in 2006 as part of an agreement with Ofcom to ensure that rival firms had fair access to the broadband network. What\u2019s changing? Ofcom will announce the result of a review into BT\u2019s Openreach monopoly on Thursday, after complaints from rivals that it gives BT an unfair advantage. We don\u2019t know exactly what will happen but Ofcom boss Sharon White has said that the status quo is the least likely outcome. While Ofcom cannot impose any changes, its recommendations carry plenty of weight, because it has the power to refer BT to the Competition and Markets Authority. That would trigger a lengthy process that nobody in the industry really wants. One option is to recommend that Openreach be split from BT entirely. A softer alternative would be to impose more restrictions separating Openreach from the rest of BT with higher \u201cChinese walls\u201d and a separate management board. Ofcom could also call for government support for rival \u201clast mile\u201d networks, such as the one being developed by CityFibre. However, a final decision might not be taken until the end of the year, or even 2017. What is wrong with Openreach? Nothing, according to BT. Everything, according to its competitors. Rival firms, who pay BT to use the last mile, say the company has underinvested in Openreach, leading to poor service. This affects customers by causing service interruptions and slow speeds. Telecoms firms are also fundamentally opposed to a set-up that puts one of their own rivals in charge of a major part of the infrastructure they use. BT\u2019s acquisition of mobile phone operator EE has intensified calls for it to be forced to offload Openreach. And the firm has faced criticism for dragging its feet on the installation of ultra-fast broadband, especially given that it is the largest beneficiary of about \u00a31bn in government funding to support fast internet through Broadband Delivery UK. What is right with it? BT says it is the only company with the scale to manage the network, particularly while it is being upgraded to offer super-fast broadband to as many homes as possible. The company says rivals who now use fibre optic cables, thanks to BT\u2019s investment in replacing slower copper wires, should stop moaning. \u201cSky and TalkTalk have been laggards when it has come to fibre so the UK would still be in the copper dark ages had Openreach had to rely on them,\u201d the company said. What does it mean for BT? Losing Openreach would be a big blow for the telecoms giant. It provided \u00a35bn of \u00a317.8bn group revenue last year, \u00a32.6bn out of \u00a36.3bn in underlying profit and more than half of its \u00a32.8bn free cash flow. Without that money, BT might find it much harder to make the multibillion-pound bets on TV sports rights that have characterised its approach in recent years. Who is saying what?

Ofcom chief executive Sharon White said: \u201cI think there will be change. We\u2019re looking at a number of options but I think it is very unlikely we will conclude that the status quo, which has worked over the last 10 years, is where we are likely to be over the next decade.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Ofcom is due to announce the initial conclusions of its Strategic Review of Digital Communications on Thursday, examining competition, investment and innovation in broadband, mobile and landline services.</p> <p>The most eagerly awaited part of the review is the regulator\u2019s recommendation on the future of BT Openreach.</p> <h2><strong>What is Openreach?</strong></h2> <p>Openreach is the division of BT that owns the fibre and copper wires that run from the local telephone exchange to homes and businesses. This part of the network is often called the \u201clast mile\u201d but in total it amounts to 76 million miles of cables snaking their way through Britain.<br></p> <p>Openreach\u2019s customers are the 537-odd service providers - the likes of Sky and TalkTalk - who sell telephone and internet services to households.<br></p> <p>It was established in 2006 as part of an agreement with Ofcom to ensure that rival firms had fair access to the broadband network.<br></p> <h2><strong>What\u2019s changing?</strong></h2> <p>Ofcom will announce the result of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/oct/06/ofcom-take-time-decision-break-up-bt-jesse-norman\">a review into BT\u2019s Openreach monopoly</a> on Thursday, after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/sep/22/bt-gavin-patterson-promises-ultrafast-internet-criticism\">complaints from rivals that it gives BT an unfair advantage</a>.<br></p> <p>We don\u2019t know exactly what will happen but Ofcom boss Sharon White has said that the status quo is the least likely outcome. While Ofcom cannot impose any changes, its recommendations carry plenty of weight, because it has the power to refer BT to the Competition and Markets Authority. That would trigger a lengthy process that nobody in the industry really wants.</p> <p>One option is to recommend that Openreach be split from BT entirely. A softer alternative would be to impose more restrictions separating Openreach from the rest of BT with higher \u201cChinese walls\u201d and a separate management board.</p> <p>Ofcom could also call for government support for rival \u201clast mile\u201d networks, such as the one being developed by CityFibre.<br></p> <p>However, a final decision might not be taken until the end of the year, or even 2017.<br></p> <h2><strong>What is wrong with Openreach?</strong></h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/09/bt-openreach-ofcom-sharon-white\">Nothing, according to BT. Everything, according to its competitors.</a> Rival firms, who pay BT to use the last mile, say the company has underinvested in Openreach, leading to poor service. This affects customers by causing service interruptions and slow speeds.<br></p> <p>Telecoms firms are also fundamentally opposed to a set-up that puts one of their own rivals in charge of a major part of the infrastructure they use.<br></p> <p>BT\u2019s acquisition of mobile phone operator EE has intensified calls for it to be forced to offload Openreach.<br></p> <p>And the firm has faced criticism for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/oct/27/openreach-connected-eight-months-internet-phone\">dragging its feet on the installation of ultra-fast broadband</a>, especially given that it is the largest beneficiary of about \u00a31bn in government funding to support fast internet through <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/broadband-delivery-uk\">Broadband Delivery UK</a>.<br></p> <h2><strong>What is right with it?</strong></h2> <p>BT says it is the only company with the scale to manage the network, particularly while it is being upgraded to offer super-fast broadband to as many homes as possible. The company says rivals who now use fibre optic cables, thanks to BT\u2019s investment in replacing slower copper wires, should stop moaning.<br></p> <p>\u201cSky and TalkTalk have been laggards when it has come to fibre so the UK would still be in the copper dark ages had Openreach had to rely on them,\u201d the company said.<br></p> <h2><strong>What does it mean for BT?</strong></h2> <p>Losing Openreach would be a big blow for the telecoms giant. It provided \u00a35bn of \u00a317.8bn group revenue last year, \u00a32.6bn out of \u00a36.3bn in underlying profit and more than half of its \u00a32.8bn free cash flow. Without that money, BT might find it much harder to make the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/sep/06/bt-sky-sporting-rights-drama-premier-league\">multibillion-pound bets on TV sports rights</a> that have characterised its approach in recent years.<br></p> <h2><strong>Who is saying what?</strong></h2> <p>Vodafone chief executive Vittorio Colao says: \u201cOpenreach is clearly not working to help competition or choice.\u201d<br></p> <p>TalkTalk chief Dido Harding describes its service as \u201cdreadful\u201d, saying the business is \u201cstarved of capital\u201d.<br></p> <p>Sky\u2019s chief economist Alan Sewell says Openreach is \u201cnot prioritised\u201d by BT and is operated as a \u201ccash cow\u201d for the company.<br></p> <p>Ofcom chief executive Sharon White said: \u201cI think there will be change.

      "bodyText": "Barratt Homes predicted continuing demand for its houses as it announced soaring first-half profits, fuelled by a shortage of homes and the government\u2019s help-to-buy scheme. Pre-tax profits at Britain\u2019s biggest housebuilder rose 40% to \u00a3295m in the six months to the end of December as revenues rose 19% to \u00a31.88bn. The dividend was increased by 25% to 6p a share. Barratt said completed sales rose 9.4% in the first half to 7,626 \u2013 the highest for eight years \u2013 and that it had made a strong start to the second half. Almost a third of sales were made under the government\u2019s help-to-buy programme, which underwrites a portion of a purchaser\u2019s mortgage for a newly built home. David Thomas, Barratt\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cWhen you look at the overall backdrop for the market it is largely positive. There is a huge focus for the government on increasing housing numbers. There is consumer demand for the product and we are confident that the mortgage market [supported] by help to buy is very attractive for our customers.\u201d The government is trying to encourage private housebuilders such as Barratt to build more homes to deal with a housing crisis caused by decades of supply failing to meet the demands of a growing population. Shortage of supply lies behind soaring house prices, particularly in London, and fears are growing that the market is heading for a crash after overseas buyers snapped up property for investment or speculation purposes. Barratt\u2019s shares, down 10% this year, were little changed at 563p. Thomas said London was an important part of Barratt\u2019s business, accounting for about 2,000 of 17,000 properties it expects to build this year. He added that about three-quarters of its London properties were priced at, or below, the \u00a3600,000 limit for help to buy. Last year Barratt sold 25 properties in central London for \u00a32m or less but the average price of a Barratt London home is \u00a3480,000. \u201cWe are not suggesting \u00a3480,000 is low cost but we are saying it is a product for people who live in London and it\u2019s less about overseas or investor buyers at the high end of the market,\u201d he said. The government recently extended help to buy until 2021 and introduced it for buyers in London. Some critics have said the move will simply push up prices in the capital, making houses less affordable. Thomas said: \u201cHelp to buy is giving you a stimulus on the demand side, which is needed if you don\u2019t have full mortgage availability. On the supply side, the government is very focused on freeing up the planning system. A backdrop which says help to buy will be there for five years gives people confidence to build.\u201d",
