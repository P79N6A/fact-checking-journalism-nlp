      "bodyText": "One of France\u2019s most prestigious champagne brands is hoping to capitalise on Britain\u2019s wine boom after planting its first vines on English soil last week. Taittinger has chosen a vineyard near the Kent village of Chilham as the site for its venture into English sparkling wine, with the first bottle due to be drunk in 2023. It is the first time a grande marque champagne house has planted a vineyard in the UK with the aim of producing a top quality English sparkling wine. The wine will be called Domaine Evremond, named after Charles de Saint-\u00c9vremond, the French writer who is credited with helping introduce 17th-century London to the habit of quaffing champagne. The move comes as figures in April revealed that wine producers in the UK will plant a record 1m vines over the next 12 months, allowing growers to produce 2 million more bottles of wine a year in the south of a country not historically known for its viticulture. Taittinger acquired the Kent farmland, in the heart of the so-called Garden of England, in the autumn of 2015. The vineyard is a joint venture between Taittinger, which has a 55% share, its UK agency and importer Hatch Mansfield, and an army of optimistic and deep-pocketed friends and investors. The project is expected to be a multimillion pound investment over the next 10 years. Taittinger considered sites in Sussex and Hampshire but chose the Kent location because it met its stringent benchmarks \u2013 that the land is no more than 100 metres above sea level, south facing, on chalk and in a sheltered position. The land was bought from the Gaskain family, who are long-established Kent fruit farmers \u2013 and investors in the venture \u2013 who will continue to grow apples, pears and plums alongside the fledgling vines. \u201cWe were very impressed by the quality of English sparkling wine already produced here,\u201d said Pierre-Emmanuel Taittinger, the champagne house\u2019s president, who helped plant the vines at a ceremony last week. \u201cWe believe the combination of chalk soils, climate and topography of our site in Kent are ideal for producing quality sparkling wine. We are aiming to create a wine with a taste that is something truly exceptional. These attributes are perfect for grape growing, and are very similar to the terroir in Champagne. For us it was a natural step.\u201d In colour-coded tubs \u2013 determining the grape variety \u2013 were bundles of spindly, red-wax-topped roots that had crossed the Channel for planting. The first 20 hectares (50 acres) of chardonnay, pinot noir and pinot meunier grapes \u2013 the three classic champagne varieties \u2013 were planted this week, with plans to plant nearly 40 hectares over the next two to three years. After some ceremonial planting by hand, the thousands of remaining vines were put into the soil by a German-made GPS planting machine. \u201cUltimately we will be aiming to produce 300,000 bottles per year of premium English sparkling wine,\u201d said Patrick McGrath, managing director of Hatch Mansfield. \u201cBut this will not be for six years or more as the vines will take time to reach the stage where they are producing the quantity of quality fruit required. It will be a gradual process.\u201d The partnership is in line with Taittinger\u2019s joint venture in California\u2019s Napa Valley called Domaine Carneros. The project will be managed by Taittinger\u2019s long-standing director of viticulture, Vincent Collard, and Stephen Skelton, a leading UK viticulturist, who have already carried out extensive testing of the soil. The winemaking will be overseen by Taittinger in a new purpose-built vineyard, combined with a visitors centre.",

      "bodyText": "Britain has more billionaires than ever in what equality campaigners said was a clear sign the UK economy is only working for the few at the top. There are now 134 billionaires based in the UK according to this year\u2019s Sunday Times Rich List, 14 more than the previous highest total, as the super-rich reap the benefits of a \u201cBrexit boom\u201d. Fifteen years ago, there were 21. The annual rich list showed that the wealthiest 1,000 individuals and families in Britain have combined wealth of \u00a3658bn, up from \u00a3575bn last year, despite fears that the Brexit vote last June would plunge the economy into a fresh turmoil. \u201cWhile many of us worried about the outcome of the EU referendum, many of Britain\u2019s richest people just kept calm and carried on making billions,\u201d said Robert Watts, the compiler of the rich list. Srichand and Gopichand Hinduja are the richest in the UK, with a fortune of \u00a316.2bn, up from \u00a313bn and second place in 2016\u2019s list. The brothers live in a \u00a3300m mansion overlooking St James\u2019s Park in central London. Sri, 81, and Gopi, 77, first topped the rich list in 2014 and have made their fortune from a business empire started by their father in Mumbai in 1914. Today, the Hinduja Group employs more than 70,000 people and has global investments in a range of sectors including oil and gas, property, media and banking. Current projects include the transformation of the Old War Office in Westminster into a luxury hotel. The Equality Trust said the \u00a383bn increase in wealth among the richest 1,000 people over the past year could pay the energy bills of all UK households for two and a half years and would be enough for the grocery bills for all food bank users for 56 years. Wanda Wyporska, the executive director of the trust, said that an elite was sitting on mountains of wealth in the fifth largest economy of the world. \u201cThe super-rich continue to streak away from the rest of us, while the poorest see their wealth shrink. This is an economy working for the few, not the many,\u201d she said. \u201cRecord numbers of people visited food banks last year, millions are locked out of a decent home and two-thirds of children in poverty are in working households. \u201cWe know that inequality damages our economy and society, and makes it harder for ordinary people and their children to get on. With the general election fast approaching, our politicians need to decide the sort of country they want to build. One where we can all prosper or one where we\u2019re picking crumbs from the super-rich\u2019s table.\u201d At least 28 of the top 100 individuals or families in the rich list have donated to the Conservative party or individual Tory politicians, according to the Electoral Commission\u2019s records. Among them are David and Simon Reuben, third on the list, who donated to Boris Johnson. Others in the top 10 who donated to the party include Guy, George and Galen Weston and Kirsten and Jorn Rausing, who donated to the West Suffolk Conservatives. The combined wealth of all the Conservative donors on the list is \u00a3102bn, according to the analysis by Labour\u2019s deputy leader, Tom Watson. \u201cThe fact that nearly a third of UK\u2019s 100 richest people have given money to the Tories tells you all you need to know about where Theresa May\u2019s priorities lie,\u201d Watson said. \u201cShe claims to speak for working people but she\u2019s beholden to the billionaires that bankroll her party.\u201d This year\u2019s rich list was released on the day Labour revealed plans to raise taxes on those earning more than \u00a380,000 a year. The threshold to make it on to the richest 1,000 list rose to \u00a3110m this year, double the threshold of 2009. In 1997, \u00a315m of personal wealth was enough. Watts said there was more diversity in this years\u2019 rich list. \u201cMore women, more people from ethnic backgrounds and more from surprising walks of life, with egg farmers and pet food makers lining up with private equity barons and hedge fund managers.\u201d While the wealth of the mega-rich rose overall, some saw their fortunes dwindle. Sir Philip and Lady Green slipped 12 places to 41 as their wealth fell by \u00a3433m over the past year, to almost \u00a32.8bn, following the collapse of BHS that triggered a bitter public row. Mike Ashley, founder of Sports Direct and owner of Newcastle United football club, dropped nine places to 54 after his fortune fell by \u00a3270m to almost \u00a32.2bn. Ashley\u2019s leadership of Sports Direct came under close scrutiny after a Guardian investigation exposed the poor treatment of warehouse workers. The singer Adele enjoyed a surge in wealth of \u00a340m, taking her to \u00a3125m, while new entries included the Scottish DJ Calvin Harris and EL James, the author of Fifty Shades of Grey. The Duke of Westminster, 26, tops the young rich list with \u00a39.5bn. He is head of the Grosvenor family, whose land and property empire spans Britain, Europe, Asia and the Americas.",

Juergen Maier, the chief executive of Siemens UK, believes new technologies including robotics, artificial intelligence and additive manufacturing, or 3D printing, can deliver greater productivity and create more highly paid jobs. But failing to crack the next revolution will come at a high price: falling living standards. The work being done in Worcester, and places like it, will be crucial if Britain is to be successful outside the EU, Maier says. The starting gun has been fired in this global race and Britain needs to get ahead. \u201cThe beauty of it is, if we get this right, it doesn\u2019t just drive productivity, but it also means that you\u2019re driving jobs up the value chain, which means that people are getting better paid, so ultimately you raise living standards,\u201d the 53-year-old says from the factory floor of Materials Solutions, which is 85% owned by Siemens and boasts big-name clients such as Rolls-Royce. \u201cIf you take it as an average, our living standards have hardly risen since the recession. The fundamental reasons are we\u2019re not exporting enough, and we\u2019re not driving productivity and output. Unless you\u2019re driving productivity, you can\u2019t raise wages.\u201d Maier, a firm supporter of the remain campaign in the run-up to the EU referendum, has quickly become the go-to expert on the future of British industry. When he met the Guardian, he was preparing to appear on BBC1\u2019s Question Time in Wigan, alongside panellists including the Brexit secretary, David Davis, and the Ukip leader, Paul Nuttall. His brief as head of the industrial digitalisation review commissioned by the government is to work out how can the UK can better deliver existing technologies, how it can create new industries and, in doing so, whether the UK can generate a net increase in manufacturing jobs despite greater levels of automation. \u201cOur gut feeling is we can, but we still need to prove that,\u201d Maier says. \u201cThe absolute nightmare for me would be that we\u2019re applying this technology, we\u2019re displacing jobs as a result of it \u2013 which will happen \u2013 but what we\u2019re not doing at the same time is creating all the jobs in computer science, in data analytics, in software code writing. The good news is we already have a lot of jobs in this area. These industries will create thousands of jobs, software jobs, engineers.\u201d With much at stake, the review is a major undertaking for Maier, but he does have support from a panel of UK business leaders including Sir Charlie Mayfield, the chairman of John Lewis Partnership, and Carolyn Fairbairn, the director general of the CBI. The current plan is to report back with initial recommendations to the business secretary, currently Greg Clark, in late summer. Maier\u2019s ambition for the UK is considerable but so too are the obstacles, not least the uncertainty created by Brexit and strong competition from the likes of Germany and the US. Another key issue will be Britain\u2019s ability to fill these highly skilled roles in sufficient numbers post-Brexit. \u201cIt is not going to be as good as it was in the single market and I think we just have to be more honest about that,\u201d Maier says. \u201cI\u2019m not a moaner or a \u2018remoaner\u2019, I\u2019m saying we have to get to grips with the realities, which are that there are going to be some barriers to trade. And the sooner we accept that the better. \u201cOnce we\u2019ve got over the heat over the elections and this slight hysteria that we\u2019ve got at the moment, we have to get into a period of calm.\u201d On Materials Solutions\u2019 factory floor in Worcester, 3D printing machines whirr quietly away, making complex metal parts for industries including automotive, aerospace and motor sports with a speed that would have been unthinkable using traditional manufacturing. Here, welding and forging are replaced with machines that turn 3D CAD models into parts using software, lasers and metal powders. For Siemens, the firm has delivered breakthrough technology, by 3D printing gas turbine blades. In doing so, the time it takes from the design of a new blade to its production has been reduced from two years to just two months. Founded and run by Carl Brancher, Materials Solutions employs 23 people and is the perfect example of how Britain can create new, cutting-edge industries, according to Maier. The Siemens boss believes the prize for the winner in the next industrial revolution is considerable: a thriving manufacturing sector, highly paid, skilled jobs and greater productivity, which would in turn fuel growth and raise living standards for all. Britain has some advantages, Maier says, including a flexible, skilled workforce and existing infrastructure that fosters innovation such as the UK\u2019s Catapult centres, the Alan Turing Institute in London and the Henry Royce Institute in Manchester. Besides, he says, we have no choice but to win the race to industrial digitalisation: there is too much at stake to fail. \u201cWe have no option. We have to pull this off and if we don\u2019t pull it off, our living standards will drop further.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "It is a truth universally acknowledged that a prime minister in possession of a strong economy wins elections. Governments lose when the country has been put through the wringer, as in 2010, and win when everything\u2019s going well, as it is now. There\u2019s only one thing wrong with this theory. The economy is not booming \u2013 it\u2019s struggling. The problems that the Conservatives inherited as part of a coalition in 2010 have not been eradicated. In many cases, they have got worse. Policy mistakes have gone unpunished. Yet the only logical conclusion from last week\u2019s local elections is that the Conservatives are on course for a thumping victory in the big one next month. This happens sometimes. The Conservatives completely mismanaged the economy between the late 1980s and the early 1990s, but won the 1992 election even though the worst housing bust in living memory and joining the exchange rate mechanism at too high a rate for the pound had sent unemployment spiralling above 3 million. The Tories handled the economy better after 1992, but lost by a street in 1997. At present, opinion polls show the Conservatives a long way ahead of Labour when it comes to voter perceptions of economic competence. This, though, does not mean the economy is doing well. It doesn\u2019t even mean that voters think the economy is doing well. It simply means they would rather have Theresa May running the show than Jeremy Corbyn, just as in 1992 they decided to stick with John Major rather than take a risk with Neil Kinnock. Over the next month, there will be much talk from the Conservatives about how they pulled the economy back from the brink of disaster in 2010. This is nonsense. Recovery from a deep recession was already under way by the time the coalition came to power. It was then brought to a halt by tax increases, spending cuts and the blow to confidence caused by absurd claims that Britain was in a comparable state to Greece. One yardstick of how the UK is doing is the growth rate, as measured by movements in gross domestic product. Over the past year, the economy has grown by about 2%, slightly below its long-term trend. But GDP is an extremely crude measure, since it takes no account of increases in population or how any rise in national output is divided up. Wages and salaries provide a better guide to economic welfare. If pay packets are going up faster than inflation, our real incomes are rising. If inflation is rising faster than wage growth, real incomes are falling. Geoff Tily, a senior economist at the TUC, has constructed an international league table of real wage growth from 2008 to 2015 using data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. It does not make pretty reading: during that period, UK real wages fell by 1% a year on average. According to Tily\u2019s analysis, Britain ranked 103rd out of 112 countries for which data was available. It\u2019s fair to say that none of the other G7 countries enjoyed spectacular real wage growth either, but the UK was the only one that saw the value of pay packets decline. Of the 34 developed nations that are members of the OECD, the only one that saw weaker wage growth between 2008 and 2015 was Greece. Still, at least British workers did better than Venezuela (104th in the league table), the West Bank and Gaza (105th) and Iran (109th). The UK\u2019s real wage performance in 2015 and 2016 was a lot better, not because the level of pay awards accelerated, but because inflation fell sharply as a result of the drop in global oil prices. But since last summer, a rebound in the cost of crude and the post-Brexit vote depreciation of sterling have led to rising inflation. Over the course of 2017, prices will grow more rapidly than pay and as a result, real wages will fall. May and her team would say a different league table \u2013 for employment growth \u2013 shows the UK in a much better light. That\u2019s true, but in a successful economy, wages and employment grow simultaneously. That has been true of every upswing in living memory, apart from the current one. Real wages don\u2019t quite tell the whole story, because purchasing power is also affected by government decisions on taxes and benefits. Here, the record of the past decade looks better, although only marginally. Real median income is currently 5% higher than it was in 2007-08, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies but it would have risen by 15% had the pre-recession trend continued. This gap is set to widen over the next five years so that by 2021-22, real incomes will be 15 percentage points below where the IFS would have expected them to be. In real money, that\u2019s \u00a35,000 a year per household on average. So how strong is an economy where employment is only going up because workers are pricing themselves into jobs by taking real wage cuts, and employers are taking advantage of an abundance of low-cost labour to skimp on investment? The answer is not very strong at all. Indeed, what you really have is a low-productivity economy where large numbers of people rely on tax credits (now being made less generous) in order to make ends meet. What\u2019s more, the fragility of the economy is underlined by its performance in the past three years. This, according to the government, is when things started to improve as a result of the \u201ctough\u201d measures taken in 2010 to sort out the mess left behind by the last Labour government. But the period of relatively strong growth since the middle of 2012 has been based on two factors: the fall in oil prices, which has since been partly reversed, and the willingness of consumers to take on more debt, which has limits. Growth this year will depend less on the housing market, which has topped out because property is unaffordable for first-time buyers, and more on the ability of exporters to take advantage of the depreciated pound. That would be easier had more of Britain\u2019s industrial base survived the travails of the past four decades. The reality is that beneath the surface glitter, the UK has some deep economic problems, from chronically weak investment to profound regional imbalances and a persistent trade deficit. Ministers know this, although for the time being it suits them to pretend otherwise. The general election would not be taking place without the Brexit vote, and Brexit would not be happening had the economy been as strong as the government claims it to be. May has been stating the blindingly obvious when she says the economy is not working for far too many people. If it were otherwise, she would not be prime minister.",

It simply means they would rather have Theresa May running the show than Jeremy Corbyn, just as in 1992 they decided to stick with John Major rather than take a risk with Neil Kinnock.</p> <p>Over the next month, there will be much talk from the Conservatives about how they pulled the economy back from the brink of disaster in 2010. This is nonsense. Recovery from a deep recession was already under way by the time the coalition came to power. It was then brought to a halt by tax increases, spending cuts and the blow to confidence caused by absurd claims that Britain was in a comparable state to Greece.</p> <p>One yardstick of how the UK is doing is the growth rate, as measured by movements in gross domestic product. Over the past year, the economy has grown by about 2%, slightly below its long-term trend. But GDP is an extremely crude measure, since it takes no account of increases in population or how any rise in national output is divided up.</p> <p>Wages and salaries provide a better guide to economic welfare. If pay packets are going up faster than inflation, our real incomes are rising. If inflation is rising faster than wage growth, real incomes are falling.<br></p> <p>Geoff Tily, a senior economist at the TUC, has constructed an international <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://touchstoneblog.org.uk/2017/02/uk-103rd-112-global-ranking-real-wage-growth-since-crisis/\">league table of real wage growth</a> from 2008 to 2015 using data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. It does not make pretty reading: during that period, UK real wages fell by 1% a year on average.</p> <p>According to Tily\u2019s analysis, Britain ranked 103rd out of 112 countries for which data was available. It\u2019s fair to say that none of the other G7 countries enjoyed spectacular real wage growth either, but the UK was the only one that saw the value of pay packets decline. Of the 34 developed nations that are members of the OECD, the only one that saw weaker wage growth between 2008 and 2015 was Greece. Still, at least British workers did better than Venezuela (104th in the league table), the West Bank and Gaza (105th) and Iran (109th).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4ad9758391178d4026dd002ec87c630fb7baab95\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4ad9758391178d4026dd002ec87c630fb7baab95/0_0_660_248/500.jpg\" alt=\"UK 103rd out of 112 in global ranking for real wage growth since the crisis\" width=\"500\" height=\"188\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The TUC\u2019s global ranking for real wage growth since the crisis</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: TUC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The UK\u2019s real wage performance in 2015 and 2016 was a lot better, not because the level of pay awards accelerated, but because inflation fell sharply as a result of the drop in global oil prices. But since last summer, a rebound in the cost of crude and the post-Brexit vote depreciation of sterling have led to rising inflation. Over the course of 2017, prices will grow more rapidly than pay and as a result, real wages will fall.</p> <p>May and her team would say a different league table \u2013 for employment growth \u2013 shows the UK in a much better light. That\u2019s true, but in a successful economy, wages and employment grow simultaneously. That has been true of every upswing in living memory, apart from the current one.</p> <p>Real wages don\u2019t quite tell the whole story, because purchasing power is also affected by government decisions on taxes and benefits. Here, the record of the past decade looks better, although only marginally. Real median income is currently 5% higher than it was in 2007-08, according to the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://election2017.ifs.org.uk/article/incomes-and-inequality-the-last-decade-and-the-next-parliament\">Institute for Fiscal Studies </a>but it would have risen by 15% had the pre-recession trend continued. This gap is set to widen over the next five years so that by 2021-22, real incomes will be 15 percentage points below where the IFS would have expected them to be. In real money, that\u2019s \u00a35,000 a year per household on average.</p> <p>So how strong is an economy where employment is only going up because workers are pricing themselves into jobs by taking real wage cuts, and employers are taking advantage of an abundance of low-cost labour to skimp on investment? The answer is not very strong at all. Indeed, what you really have is a low-productivity economy where large numbers of people rely on tax credits (now being made less generous) in order to make ends meet.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>What\u2019s more, the fragility of the economy is underlined by its performance in the past three years. This, according to the government, is when things started to improve as a result of the \u201ctough\u201d measures taken in 2010 to sort out the mess left behind by the last Labour government.</p> <p>But the period of relatively strong growth since the middle of 2012 has been based on two factors: the fall in oil prices, which has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/may/05/oil-plunges-to-lowest-level-for-five-months-amid-global-growth-fears\">since been partly reversed</a>, and the willingness of consumers to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/04/uk-credit-cards-borrowing-debt-economic-crash-fears\">take on more debt</a>, which has limits. Growth this year will depend less on the housing market, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/apr/28/uk-house-prices-april-brexit-inflation-wages-nationwide\">which has topped out</a> because property is <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/may/01/smaller-deposits-raise-hopes-for-uk-first-time-homebuyers\">unaffordable for first-time buyers</a>, and more on the ability of <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/mar/31/sterlings-fall-lifts-uk-exports-figures-show\">exporters to take advantage</a> of the depreciated pound. That would be easier had more of Britain\u2019s industrial base survived the travails of the past four decades.</p> <p>The reality is that beneath the surface glitter, the UK has some deep economic problems, from chronically weak investment to profound regional imbalances and a persistent trade deficit. Ministers know this, although for the time being it suits them to pretend otherwise. </p> <p>The general election would not be taking place without the Brexit vote, and Brexit would not be happening had the economy been as strong as the government claims it to be. May has been stating the blindingly obvious when she says the economy is not working for far too many people. If it were otherwise, she would not be prime minister.</p>",

      "bodyText": "In 2009, shortly after the global markets had suffered their worst crisis for 90 years, Alexis Stenfors was working as a currency trader for Merrill Lynch in London. With 15 years\u2019 experience, he was good at his job and he prided himself on his ability to read the markets. His view was that the whole financial system was going to go \u201cbelly up\u201d. That was what he was betting on. And boy did he bet. He took increasingly extreme positions and when they failed to return dividends, he covered up losses in his trading books that he estimated to be around $100m (\u00a378m). Then he went on holiday to India. Stenfors didn\u2019t realise it at the time, but it was the end of his career as a trader, and the beginning of his notoriety as a rogue trader. Merrill Lynch later announced that his actions had resulted in the loss of $456m (\u00a3356m). He lost his job, the media left his reputation in tatters and he was banned from the City for five years. Now he has written Barometer of Fear, a book about his experiences. Or rather, he has written a book that touches on his experience, but is rather more concerned with institutional wrongdoing, such as the Libor scandal. It\u2019s a strange confession-cum-critique in which the author still seems unable to explain his own role. One chapter, quoting the question that has often been put to him, is titled: \u201cWhy did you do it?\u201d At the end of it, having not said much about his motivations, he writes that, despite seeing a psychiatrist for two years: \u201cI am not sure if I have come any closer to a definitive answer to the question.\u201d When discussing banking flaws he can be authoritative, but about himself he appears detached, incurious, even alienated. Yet the man I meet at SOAS, University of London, is far more open than his prose. Stenfors is originally from Finland, part of the small Swedish-speaking minority. He says that this made him feel different to the crowd. As a young boy, he developed a fascination with foreign currencies, collecting coins and making lists of their value. It was an interest, he says, that led him to go into banking, working as an intern at Dresdner bank in Germany in the early 90s. And it would lead him to London, on to Japan and then back to London again, the scene of his downfall. He once told a journalist that, as a young man in Finland, he had used the name Patrick Bateman to book squash courts. Bateman is the New York trader and homicidal psychopath in Bret Easton Ellis\u2019s novel, American Psycho, a book Stenfors had enjoyed. It was a joke, but apparently that was the extent of evidence in Stenfors\u2019s blameless background that he might one day dabble in infamy. He describes an affluent but pressurised life as a trader, with huge financial rewards but little opportunity to do anything with them. He also writes of a ruthless managerial approach. One boss suggested that Stenfors\u2019s wife Maria should be induced when she was having a troublesome pregnancy, to save Stenfors having to take time off. On another occasion, his request for leave to visit his sick father was turned down, and his father died before he could get to him. But none of this lessened his dedication to the job. Now a lean 46-year-old academic, he looks relaxed in a dark suit and open-necked shirt. His short dark hair is untroubled by grey. He lives with Maria and their two children in central London. Unlike some other notable rogue traders, Stenfors never came close to being sent to prison. Why? \u201cThere was never a criminal investigation, or even a hint that it could be criminal,\u201d he says. Initially he was angry that he had been grouped with the likes of Nick Leeson, the trader who brought down Barings Bank. But couldn\u2019t his deceit, deliberately mismarking his books, be seen as a kind of fraud? \u201cI think you would have to ask a lawyer,\u201d he says. \u201cFirst of all, the process of valuing a book, we did it ourselves as the traders. Looking back, how on earth can you have such a set up?\u201d Good question. Perhaps the most shocking element of Stenfors\u2019s new book is that it confirms that the economic crisis, which was effectively created by the banks, did very little to make the banks address their bad habits. Merrill Lynch, for example, had to be bailed out by the Bank of America in what amounted to a buyout. On New Year\u2019s Eve 2008, the day before the deal went through, Merrill Lynch brought forward its bonus payments by several months and lavished them on staff. Once the deal was complete, Merrill Lynch announced it had just lost $13.8bn (\u00a310.7bn) in the previous three months. Stenfors says that this manoeuvre made him feel \u201csick\u201d. \u201cI had this feeling that there was something really wrong with the system,\u201d he says, and notes that the problems have continued with the massive Libor and foreign currency manipulations. But it didn\u2019t stop him from making wild bets in a desperate effort to make money for a bank that had played an instrumental role in the complex junk trades that helped bring about the crisis. \u201cI didn\u2019t have the capability to think about the system as a whole,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was like working in a nuclear reactor. You\u2019re so busy working on pipes here and there, you don\u2019t get to go outside and say: \u2018Hang on, what happens if the whole things explodes?\u2019\u201d Except that was exactly what Stenfors was gambling on. None of it makes sense, but he describes a kind of intense social isolation dominated by work. He didn\u2019t really see anyone who wasn\u2019t involved in finance, other than his wife and their two children. Inside the bubble, all that mattered was winning. It didn\u2019t matter if the price of the victory was the demise of everything else. And that seemed to be enough to quell any doubts he may have had. Stenfors describes himself as someone whose political sympathies have always been on the left. But he also recalls an occasion when he was told by a manager to sack a Japanese trader whose healthy profits were not steep enough for the company\u2019s liking. He did as he was told. \u201cWhere do you draw the line between the morals of the bank and the morals you hold yourself?\u201d he writes. \u201cShould any such line be drawn at all?\u201d I\u2019m astonished by this question, which seems a total abnegation of personal responsibility. Can he really be so ambivalent? \u201cI think it\u2019s very clear that you should follow your own morals in this sense, and that\u2019s what I wish I had done much earlier,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it\u2019s very easy for me to say: \u2018Follow your own morals and it will be fine.\u2019 But it won\u2019t be fine. Because if you break the rules and conventions, you\u2019ll begin to run into trouble.\u201d He talks about not being invited to drinks parties, and being denied the trading book you desired or getting a smaller bonus. All of which makes it sound as if it\u2019s pretty easy for the banking culture to maintain immoral practices. I ask Stenfors how much money he was earning at his peak. \u201cI don\u2019t want to say,\u201d he replies. I push him several times, because I want to know how much money corrupts, and how much is enough to enable someone to walk away. Eventually, he says that in 2008 he earned \u201ca seven-figure sum\u201d. However, he argues that money is not the issue, because you never have time to spend it. What motivated him, he says, was being right. \u201cYou get these bonus cheques, but there\u2019s no way you can use the money, only maybe when you retire. I\u2019ve spoken to so many people over the years and all they want to do is open a pub in Cornwall. But they never do because they never have enough money.\u201d At \u00a31m and more a year, you wonder how much it costs to open a boozer. But the point is that the more you earn, the more you believe you need to earn. For all his talk about not caring about money, Stenfors admits that it irked him if his bonus was not as large as he thought he deserved. Sometimes he made a lot of money for the bank, but the bank overall didn\u2019t perform well, and he felt short-changed. \u201cTrading is very individualistic. You think you deserve this regardless of how the company as a whole is doing. It\u2019s only me, me, me. I was extremely arrogant. But money in this sense isn\u2019t necessarily about acquiring wealth. It\u2019s more like you\u2019ve won the race and you think you deserve the gold medal.\u201d Stenfors took a PhD in economics at SOAS after he left trading, or trading left him. He is now a senior lecturer in economics and finance at Portsmouth University. He has a wide range of friends, he says, and feels much happier. I ask him if he felt his job as a trader was important. He did at the time, he says \u2013 he thought he played a vital role in helping global trade. But now he is not proud of the speculative element. \u201cThe betting was way too much. It was sort of like it started small and then it became so extremely large.\u201d But for all his apparent objection to speculation, I can see something in his eyes when he speaks about trading, a spark of excitement. He\u2019s now eligible to apply for a licence again. Would he do it? \u201cI miss the buzz and I follow the markets,\u201d he says, \u201cbut I don\u2019t think so.\u201d He says he couldn\u2019t do it without becoming obsessed again. Does he miss the money? \u201cOf course, it\u2019s always easier to live if you have more money, but to go back to trading simply to make more money? No, I wouldn\u2019t. I know that if I went back, I know what I would become.\u201d A risk-taker? In the book, he writes: \u201cAlthough other people in the market probably saw me as a big risk-taker, I didn\u2019t spend much time thinking about it \u2013 at least not until it was too late.\u201d \u201cThat was the only thing that I really liked,\u201d he says now. \u201cWithout being a risk-taker, I would not even think about it. That was the thing I enjoyed.\u201d I think he should stick to lecturing. The axeman cometh: an extract from Barometer of Fear Early on I learned to accept that the rules of trading did not always apply to the rest of society or vice versa. Despite this, conventions within the dealing room felt logical and everybody seemed to accept them. In the absence of outside regulation, the banks simply wrote the rules themselves, which were then accepted by the rest of the market as well. The environment might not have been pleasant, fair or honest all the time \u2013 but even so I did not think of trading as immoral. During the 1939-40 Winter War between Finland and the Soviet Union, the Finnish army had a sniper called Simo H\u00e4yh\u00e4. Having killed 505 soldiers in less than 100 days, he came to be nicknamed White Death by the Red Army. Some 40 years later, when H\u00e4yh\u00e4 was asked whether he had any regrets about killing all those people, he answered: \u201cI only did my duty, and what I was told to do, as well as I could.\u201d Traders who showed no compassion for wounded competitors were sometimes also nicknamed \u201csnipers\u201d. Individuals who do their duty, what they are told to do, and as well as they can, are often considered perfect employees \u2013 no matter what their job description is. I was once told by a manager to fire a Japanese employee in my team who had served the bank for two decades. The trader in question had done nothing wrong and had generated a stable revenue stream every year. But the trajectory was not steep enough and the trader had to go. I remember expressing unease about the assignment, not least because of the Japanese tradition of lifelong employment. \u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d I was told. \u201cWe can always suggest a cleaning job in Hokkaido.\u201d I understood. Giving the trader the option of moving to another island of Japan would mean that the bank, technically speaking, still required the employee\u2019s services. However, given that it would mean being humiliated in front of family and friends, the trader would never exercise that option. I did my duty. Afterwards, some colleagues jokingly began to call me the Axeman. I hated the nickname, but thankfully did not have to perform any more such executions. Money probably does have a tendency to drive out morality. Barometer of Fear by Alexis Stenfors is published by Zed Books at \u00a39.99 on 15 May.

Why?</p> <p>\u201cThere was never a criminal investigation, or even a hint that it could be criminal,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Initially he was angry that he had been grouped with the likes of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/from-the-archive-blog/2015/feb/24/nick-leeson-barings-bank-1995-20-archive\">Nick Leeson</a>, the trader who brought down Barings Bank. But couldn\u2019t his deceit, deliberately mismarking his books, be seen as a kind of fraud? \u201cI think you would have to ask a lawyer,\u201d he says. \u201cFirst of all, the process of valuing a book, we did it ourselves as the traders. Looking back, how on earth can you have such a set up?\u201d</p> <p>Good question. Perhaps the most shocking element of Stenfors\u2019s new book is that it confirms that the economic crisis, which was effectively created by the banks, did very little to make the banks address their bad habits. Merrill Lynch, for example, had to be bailed out by the Bank of America in what amounted to a buyout. On New Year\u2019s Eve 2008, the day before the deal went through, Merrill Lynch brought forward its bonus payments by several months and lavished them on staff. Once the deal was complete, Merrill Lynch announced it had just lost $13.8bn (\u00a310.7bn) in the previous three months. Stenfors says that this manoeuvre made him feel \u201csick\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI had this feeling that there was something really wrong with the system,\u201d he says, and notes that the problems have continued with the massive Libor and foreign currency manipulations.</p> <p>But it didn\u2019t stop him from making wild bets in a desperate effort to make money for a bank that had played an instrumental role in the complex junk trades that helped bring about the crisis. \u201cI didn\u2019t have the capability to think about the system as a whole,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was like working in a nuclear reactor. You\u2019re so busy working on pipes here and there, you don\u2019t get to go outside and say: \u2018Hang on, what happens if the whole things explodes?\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8c18f989e0db39cda2788ba5e6cc439daff9600e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8c18f989e0db39cda2788ba5e6cc439daff9600e/0_51_4064_2438/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A man walking past the Merrill Lynch logo outside its building\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Merrill Lynch employee leaves the building after an \u2018irregularity\u2019 was discovered in March 2009.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andy Rain/Rex Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Except that was exactly what Stenfors was gambling on. None of it makes sense, but he describes a kind of intense social isolation dominated by work. He didn\u2019t really see anyone who wasn\u2019t involved in finance, other than his wife and their two children. Inside the bubble, all that mattered was winning. It didn\u2019t matter if the price of the victory was the demise of everything else.</p> <p>And that seemed to be enough to quell any doubts he may have had. Stenfors describes himself as someone whose political sympathies have always been on the left. But he also recalls an occasion when he was told by a manager to sack a Japanese trader whose healthy profits were not steep enough for the company\u2019s liking. He did as he was told.</p> <p>\u201cWhere do you draw the line between the morals of the bank and the morals you hold yourself?\u201d he writes. \u201cShould any such line be drawn at all?\u201d I\u2019m astonished by this question, which seems a total abnegation of personal responsibility. Can he really be so ambivalent?</p> <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s very clear that you should follow your own morals in this sense, and that\u2019s what I wish I had done much earlier,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it\u2019s very easy for me to say: \u2018Follow your own morals and it will be fine.\u2019 But it won\u2019t be fine. Because if you break the rules and conventions, you\u2019ll begin to run into trouble.\u201d He talks about not being invited to drinks parties, and being denied the trading book you desired or getting a smaller bonus. All of which makes it sound as if it\u2019s pretty easy for the banking culture to maintain immoral practices.</p> <p>I ask Stenfors how much money he was earning at his peak. \u201cI don\u2019t want to say,\u201d he replies. I push him several times, because I want to know how much money corrupts, and how much is enough to enable someone to walk away. Eventually, he says that in 2008 he earned \u201ca seven-figure sum\u201d. However, he argues that money is not the issue, because you never have time to spend it. What motivated him, he says, was being right.</p> <p>\u201cYou get these bonus cheques, but there\u2019s no way you can use the money, only maybe when you retire. I\u2019ve spoken to so many people over the years and all they want to do is open a pub in Cornwall. But they never do because they never have enough money.\u201d At \u00a31m and more a year, you wonder how much it costs to open a boozer.</p> <p>But the point is that the more you earn, the more you believe you need to earn. For all his talk about not caring about money, Stenfors admits that it irked him if his bonus was not as large as he thought he deserved. Sometimes he made a lot of money for the bank, but the bank overall didn\u2019t perform well, and he felt short-changed.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u00a0didn\u2019t think about the system as a whole. You never say: \u2018Hang on, what happens if the whole things explodes?\u2019</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cTrading is very individualistic. You think you deserve this regardless of how the company as a whole is doing. It\u2019s only me, me, me. I was extremely arrogant. But money in this sense isn\u2019t necessarily about acquiring wealth. It\u2019s more like you\u2019ve won the race and you think you deserve the gold medal.\u201d</p> <p>Stenfors took a PhD in economics at SOAS after he left trading, or trading left him. He is now a senior lecturer in economics and finance at Portsmouth University. He has a wide range of friends, he says, and feels much happier.</p> <p>I ask him if he felt his job as a trader was important. He did at the time, he says \u2013 he thought he played a vital role in helping global trade. But now he is not proud of the speculative element. \u201cThe betting was way too much. It was sort of like it started small and then it became so extremely large.\u201d</p> <p>But for all his apparent objection to speculation, I can see something in his eyes when he speaks about trading, a spark of excitement. He\u2019s now eligible to apply for a licence again. Would he do it? \u201cI miss the buzz and I follow the markets,\u201d he says, \u201cbut I don\u2019t think so.\u201d He says he couldn\u2019t do it without becoming obsessed again.</p> <p>Does he miss the money? \u201cOf course, it\u2019s always easier to live if you have more money, but to go back to trading simply to make more money? No, I wouldn\u2019t. I know that if I went back, I know what I would become.\u201d</p> <p>A risk-taker? In the book, he writes: \u201cAlthough other people in the market probably saw me as a big risk-taker, I didn\u2019t spend much time thinking about it \u2013 at least not until it was too late.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat was the only thing that I really liked,\u201d he says now. \u201cWithout being a risk-taker, I would not even think about it. That was the thing I enjoyed.\u201d</p> <p>I think he should stick to lecturing.</p> <h2>The axeman cometh: an extract from Barometer of Fear</h2> <p>Early on I learned to accept that the rules of trading did not always apply to the rest of society or vice versa. Despite this, conventions within the dealing room felt logical and everybody seemed to accept them. In the absence of outside regulation, the banks simply wrote the rules themselves, which were then accepted by the rest of the market as well. The environment might not have been pleasant, fair or honest all the time \u2013 but even so I did not think of trading as immoral.</p> <p>During the 1939-40 Winter War between Finland and the Soviet Union, the Finnish army had a sniper called Simo H\u00e4yh\u00e4. Having killed 505 soldiers in less than 100 days, he came to be nicknamed White Death by the Red Army. Some 40 years later, when H\u00e4yh\u00e4 was asked whether he had any regrets about killing all those people, he answered: \u201cI only did my duty, and what I was told to do, as well as I could.\u201d Traders who showed no compassion for wounded competitors were sometimes also nicknamed \u201csnipers\u201d. Individuals who do their duty, what they are told to do, and as well as they can, are often considered perfect employees \u2013 no matter what their job description is.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"206d373cf5d6180eea29760a2a17cfcc000fe326\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/206d373cf5d6180eea29760a2a17cfcc000fe326/0_4335_6036_3620/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alexis Stenfors sitting on a wooden bench clasping his hands together, looking at the camera\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The risk was the only thing I liked\u2019: Stenfors today. He was banned from trading for five years.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pal Hansen for the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I was once told by a manager to fire a Japanese employee in my team who had served the bank for two decades. The trader in question had done nothing wrong and had generated a stable revenue stream every year. But the trajectory was not steep enough and the trader had to go. I remember expressing unease about the assignment, not least because of the Japanese tradition of lifelong employment.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I wouldn\u2019t go back to trading simply to make money. I know what I\u00a0would become</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d I was told. \u201cWe can always suggest a cleaning job in Hokkaido.\u201d I understood. Giving the trader the option of moving to another island of Japan would mean that the bank, technically speaking, still required the employee\u2019s services. However, given that it would mean being humiliated in front of family and friends, the trader would never exercise that option. I did my duty.</p> <p>Afterwards, some colleagues jokingly began to call me the Axeman. I hated the nickname, but thankfully did not have to perform any more such executions. Money probably does have a tendency to drive out morality.</p> <p><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/barometer-of-fear.html\">Barometer of Fear</a><em> by Alexis Stenfors is published by Zed Books at \u00a39.99 on 15 May.

      "bodyText": "As the biggest company in the world, Apple operates to different rules from other businesses. That was apparent against last week when Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, partly blamed weaker-than-expected iPhone sales on leaks about future products. Cook said that there had been a \u201cpause in purchases\u201d due to \u201cearlier and much more frequent reports about future iPhones\u201d. There is undoubtedly some truth in this \u2013 why buy a product when you know a better version will be available in a few months? However, this is an issue that Apple faces every year; indeed, it is something that it actively encourages with its glitzy ceremonies to launch new and upgraded products. Wall Street appears to have shrugged off the news that Apple missed expectations, because shares in the company still rose 3% over the last week. It remains the most valuable company in the world, with a stock market value of more than $750bn (\u00a3579bn). However, the quarterly results are a reminder that the company is far from infallible and that its extraordinary run of success since launching the iPhone in 2007 is nearer the end than the start. Apple reported iPhone sales of 50.8m in the first three months of 2017, down by 1% year-on-year. Its revenues grew 5% to $52.9bn, which was just below analysts\u2019 forecasts of $53.1bn. The company\u2019s financial performance is heavily reliant on the iPhone. While it generated more than $33bn of sales in the quarter, a category it defines as \u201cother products\u201d, which includes the iPod, Apple TV and the Apple Watch, generated just $2.9bn. While the Apple Watch may be popular with those who use it, it has certainly not created a new platform of customers for the company to meaningfully develop \u2013 not yet, anyway. Reports in the technology industry suggest that the next iPhone will be a significant step forward. According to rumours, it could include wireless charging, 3D facial recognition and a curved display. But even so, an upgrade to an existing product is unlikely to be a game-changer in the same way that the original iPhone was a decade ago, or the iPod and the iPad were. It is also worth remembering that Apple saw sales of the iPhone decline in 2016; last October, the company revealed its first fall in annual sales and profits in 15 years. It would be foolhardy to call this the peak for Apple, because you can never be sure what mystery products are lurking in its research and development buildings. However, it is clearly becoming more difficult for Apple, Samsung and others to expand the smartphone sector. The devices are now effectively a commodity, particularly in the western world. The market is for customers looking to upgrade every couple of years rather than those looking to buy their first handset. But a slowdown in its biggest market makes the $250bn cash mountain that Apple is still sitting on even more intriguing. Analysts at Citigroup, the investment bank, have drawn up a list of seven companies that Apple could buy with the cash. Their candidates are Netflix, Walt Disney, Tesla, streaming service Hulu, and video game makers Activision Blizzard, Electronic Arts and Take Two Interactive. Some of these deals, such as Disney or the videogame makers, would basically be bolt-ons that would allow Apple to share the success these businesses already enjoy. Buying Tesla, however, could be transformative and help Apple down the path towards transferring its technology to driverless and electric vehicles. Rumours suggest that Apple may already be working on an electric vehicle anyway. Even if Apple does not do a deal, it seems its next move will be about bringing its technology closer to our everyday lives, whether through a car or turning its headphones into health monitors, another rumoured plan. As smartphone sales slow, we are closer than ever to finding out what Apple\u2019s next move will be. In the wrong at Pearson Pearson chief executive John Fallon\u2019s suggestion that he was somehow doing the decent thing was irritating. After collecting a \u00a3343,000 bonus for a year in which the educational publisher lost \u00a32.6bn, Fallon told shareholders on Friday: \u201cI don\u2019t decide what CEOs get paid but I did decide once the payment was made that the right thing to do was buy shares in Pearson.\u201d No, Mr Fallon, after a year like 2016, the right course was to waive the bonus and rub along on your \u00a3780,000 salary. It is true that the last of the five profits warnings in the past four years arrived a few weeks after the end of Pearson\u2019s financial year, but it was a humdinger of a warning. It signalled a cut in the dividend this year, thereby removing the sole source of solace for investors during Fallon\u2019s ill-starred reign. The share price, even after the bounce that accompanied the unveiling of yet another restructuring plan, has halved in little more than two years. Fallon is correct that the remuneration committee sets his pay. Thus Elizabeth Corley, chair of that committee, and Sidney Taurel, group chairman, must take direct blame for a fiasco that saw almost two-thirds of voting shareholders oppose the remuneration report. Almost a third also opposed Pearson\u2019s forward-looking pay policy. That level of opposition is extremely rare at FTSE 100 companies. Corley also received a 27% vote against her re-election. She is the former chief executive of giant investment manager Allianz Global Investors, so this was a case of shareholding fund managers voting against one of their own. She should take the hint and go. Pearson\u2019s commitment to \u201ccontinuing dialogue with our shareholders\u201d on pay will look thin if the same individual is sent out to bat again. \u201cWe\u2019re the world\u2019s learning company,\u201d says the corporate blurb, but Pearson has shown zero understanding of the public anger over undeserved corporate pay. The lesson isn\u2019t hard: when you\u2019ve reported record losses, don\u2019t give the boss a bonus. Shale industry turns tables on Opec Oil industry hopes that the price of Brent crude would stabilise at around $60 (\u00a346) a barrel were dashed last week. The price was supposed to rise from the average of $55 seen over recent months, following a squeeze on oil production orchestrated by Saudi Arabia and the 13-nation Opec cartel. An improving global economy was also expected to push the price higher as global demand outstripped supply. Indeed, BP and Shell reported bumper profits last week amid signs of an upturn for the big industry players. But US shale operators have had other ideas. They turned on the taps once the price passed $50 and their derricks became profitable again. This led to the oil price falling below the $50 mark again last week. For consumers, it spells a return to lower prices at the petrol pumps and some relief from rising inflation. For the industry and Opec, however, it confirms that shale provides an effective cap on prices however hard they work.",

An improving global economy was also expected to push the price higher as global demand outstripped supply. Indeed, BP and Shell reported bumper profits last week amid signs of an upturn for the big industry players.</p> <p>But US shale operators have had other ideas. They turned on the taps once the price passed $50 and their derricks became profitable again. This led to the oil price falling below the $50 mark again last week.</p> <p>For consumers, it spells a return to lower prices at the petrol pumps and some relief from rising inflation. For the industry and Opec, however, it confirms that shale provides an effective cap on prices however hard they work.</p>",

      "bodyText": "This month sees the 20th anniversary of the granting by New Labour of independence to the Bank of England. It was not full-scale independence but \u201coperational independence\u201d in monetary policy: that is, the freedom to change interest rates without having to consult the chancellor. The Bank is still the Treasury\u2019s agent in other matters, such as decisions about the nation\u2019s currency reserves. The Strand Group at King\u2019s College London held a high-powered conference to mark Bank independence last week: but against the background of elections and all this Brexit nonsense, the anniversary of what was a controversial event at the time seems to have passed non-aficionados by. I myself was against the move at the time, and while hardly anyone questions the idea now, I am still inclined to take the Zhou Enlai view. This is a reference to then Chinese premier\u2019s reply in the 1970s when he was asked what he thought the consequences of the French Revolution had been. He famously replied: \u201cToo early to tell.\u201d This has gone down in fake history as a witty reference to the events of 1789, but an official who was present said Zhou was actually referring to the riots in Paris in 1968. Even critics of Gordon Brown give him, and his economic adviser at the time, Ed Balls, credit for making the Bank independent in this area. It is noteworthy, however, that most of the Brexiters who go on about parliamentary sovereignty seem to have no qualms about placing decisions in the hands of unelected officials. The granting of independence was the final resort of British policymakers in the long, and losing, battle for Labour and Tories alike to control inflation. Both parties had problems with incomes policies in the 1970s. The Tories brought monetarism from 1979, but that failed \u2013 indeed, the doctrine was even subsequently disowned by Milton Friedman, its most prominent advocate. Then came Chancellor Lawson\u2019s obsession with the success of the Germans in controlling inflation; his instrument was to be membership of the European exchange rate mechanism. When Margaret Thatcher vetoed that, Lawson directed the Bank to intervene in the foreign exchange market so that the pound \u201cshadowed\u201d the Deutschmark. When he was rumbled, there was hell to pay, ending with Lawson\u2019s dramatic resignation in 1989. Ironically, after Lawson went, Thatcher was finally worn down a year later, and the pound joined the ERM in 1990. Membership of the ERM then ended in sterling\u2019s ignominious exit from the mechanism on Black Wednesday, 16 September 1992. Amazingly, the British establishment did not seem to be aware of what the Germans knew only too well: namely that the historic reunification of Germany at around the time we joined the ERM would have serious inflationary consequences, because of the massive cost of absorbing the run-down East German economy. It was exactly the wrong time to subject Britain to what was effectively German monetary policy. John Major was prime minister, and he took the rap. Now, although some fanatics had been trying to reverse the result of the 1975 referendum (a two-to-one verdict in favour of remaining in the EEC we had joined in 1973) from the start, we can really date the onset of the cancerous growth of Euroscepticism in the Conservative party to the early 1990s. The general election of 1992 saw the end of the dominance of pro-Europeans in the parliamentary party and the rise of what the beleaguered Major termed the Eurosceptic \u201cbastards\u201d. Meanwhile, after the ERM, the next supposed panacea for British inflation was central bank independence. While this period has coincided with low inflation, it has not necessarily caused it. Most industrial countries have had low inflation in recent times. However, central bank independence is but a sideshow when it comes to the major economic crisis of our times, which is the prospect of Brexit. Which brings us to David Cameron. I gather that Samantha Cameron has been quoted as saying words to the effect that \u201cDave can rationalise himself out of anything\u201d. To judge from reports of what our former prime minister recently said in Kiev, he is rationalising his disastrous decision to hold a referendum on the grounds that the Euroscepticism that was poisoning the Tory party had to be addressed. Well, it is an open question whether the poison has been neutralised. Quite apart from that, we are in the lamentable position where a Tory party that used to have the national interest at heart is now sacrificing everything to its own preservation. Yes: thanks to Theresa May\u2019s lame acceptance of the result of a referendum conducted on a false prospectus, the poison has now spread to the nation at large. We have a government that really is, in Angela Merkel\u2019s word, \u201cdelusional\u201d about squaring the circle: obsessed by the immigration she failed to control at the Home Office, May wishes to leave the customs union and the single market while cherrypicking her way back into the best bits. This is impossible. As often happens, the people running this country do not seem to realise that our continental partners have their own interests, and tend to say what they mean. It is not too late to rethink. My old friend Lord Kerr, who drafted article 50 of the Lisbon treaty, says that it is not irrevocable. It is reversible. There is still an opportunity for our leaders to see sense, and own up to the people. I know the people have spoken. They spoke in 1945 and said one thing, and in 1951 and said another. Throughout the 1960s, the 1970s, the 1990s and the first decade of this millennium, they said one thing, and then another. To coin a phrase: it is a people\u2019s privilege to change its mind.",
