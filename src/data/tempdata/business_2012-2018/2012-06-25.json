    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Royal Bank of Scotland is continuing to keep thousands of branches open for longer in an effort to contain the fallout of its ongoing computer crisis, which analysts said would cost the bailed-out bank tens of millions of pounds. On the sixth day of the computer problems that have stopped as many as 13 million customers of NatWest, Ulster Bank and RBS from accessing account information, the chief executive, Stephen Hester, spoke publicly for the first time to say that the bank was \"well on the road to recovery\" in tackling the crisis. Bonuses next year would take account of the inconvenience to customers, he added. Banking analyst Ian Gordon of Investec estimated that the crisis could cost RBS tens of millions of pounds in repaying overdraft charges and other fees, ensuring customers stuck abroad were not left out of pocket, and covering overtime bills for staff, about 7,000 of whom were parachuted in over the weekend to open branches on a Sunday for the first time. Putting a price on reputational damage was tougher \u2013 especially if customers move their accounts. There were more reports on Monday nightof customers badly inconvenienced by the meltdown, including an unnamed man who was granted bail at Canterbury crown court, Kent, on Friday, but had to wait until Monday to be released because the bank computer problems prevented the court from confirming receipt of a surety demanded by the judge in the case. Opening hours were extended until 7pm on Monday and branches will open from 8am to 6pm for the rest of the week. Credit card customers will be able to withdraw \u00a3100 extra without incurring fees. But Hester, who praised the bank's staff, faced criticism from the union Unite for the scale of job cuts he has embarked on since taking the helm after the 2008 bailout. David Fleming, national officer for Unite, said: \"RBS management has slashed 30,000 staff, cut pay and decimated the pensions of those dedicated staff who are now working hard to resolve the problems.\" Hester, in an interview with Sky News, insisted there was no evidence that job cuts or outsourcing were to blame. The main IT centre was in Edinburgh, said Hester, who has based himself in the Scottish capital rather than London for the coming days. The problem was caused by a botched systems upgrade last Tuesday, which caused a backlog at a bank that normally handles 10m payments a day. Other banks are also now receiving delayed information about transactions. Hester said management would be \"accountable for our actions\" and customer service would be taken into account when bonuses are decided next year. The Liberal Democrat peer Lord Oakeshott said: \"There's no need for Stephen Hester to waste time worrying about his bonus this year. RBS has failed the nation and must be broken up now, with the casino sold off or shut down and the basic bank focusing on the job we paid it \u00a345bn to perform properly.\" The Financial Services Authority, which has asked rival banks to treat their customers affected by the RBS problems fairly, is demanding a complete account of the problem. Hester said there would be a \"full drains-up\" investigation. The bank said NatWest and RBS systems were now operating normally, but continuing issues at Ulster Bank have forced Hester to send senior colleague Chris Sullivan to Dublin to sort out the situation. Hester insisted customer reaction had been terrific and said the bank should be judged on how it deals with the crisis. But comparison website Moneynet.co.uk reported a 10% jump in the number of visitors to its current account pages over the past seven days, compared with the rest of 2012. \"It looks as if the NatWest problems could be good news for its competitors,\" Moneynet.co.uk spokesman Andrew Hagger said. There was also anecdotal evidence on the Guardian website that customers are looking at switching. One, using the name chingwu, wrote: \"Seriously considering moving my account to the Co-op. Refusing my wife's card, yet oddly all direct debits went out as normal. Not a happy bunny!\" Most of the customers at a branch of NatWest in King's Cross, north London, on Monday were no longer experiencing problems with their accounts yesterday, although they were aware of friends and colleagues still suffering. At the Headingley branch of NatWest in Leeds, most customers said they were no longer experiencing problems, although Liam Wiseman, a PE student at Leeds Met University, said he was without keys to his new flat because the deposit was stuck in the system. Phil Wood, 19, a business management student at Leeds Met, works at McDonald's and said his pay did not reach his account for two days, forcing him to borrow from a friend. Customers seeking redress need to apply to RBS first, the Financial Ombudsman Service said. Smaller systems failures in the past had resulted in no complaints to the FOS because the banks \"stepped up to the plate\". This failure could be more complicated, however, because of its length, and the FOS could receive complaints about \"consequential losses\", such as the missed opportunity to buy items at a certain price, or the collapse of a house purchase.",

The move would enable Tesco to \"get to know our customers better still, and use that understanding to deliver an even more personalised offer\", said Clarke who said one outcome would be personalised promotions when a shopper browses its website.</p>",

The award of 456,000 shares was made after Philips' appointment to secure his services for at least another two years. \"This was a difficult decision, but by the time I leave next year I will have been with Morrisons for over eight years and I feel that it's the right time to seek new challenges,\" said Pennycook. He joined Morrisons from the breakdown recovery firm RAC, but previously specialised in company turnarounds. He spent a year at Hereford cider group HP Bulmer, which was sold to Scottish &amp; Newcastle, and before that led the restructuring of both Welcome Break and Laura Ashley. He is understood to be keen to return to this sphere. Morrisons' chairman, Sir Ian Gibson, said Pennycook had done an \"outstanding job\" and had played an \"increasing strategic role in the last few years\". The search for a successor would commence in short order, the company said. The shares closed down 3.6p at 264.8p. After Tesco's profit warning in January, which was blamed on the poor performance, its chief executive Philip Clarke has turned up the heat on the competition with a blitz of money-off coupons and price cuts. he told the Consumer Goods Forum in Istanbul Tesco was \"turning Clubcard digital\", correlating loyalty card information on what shoppers buy with feeds from social networks, mobile phone data and payment methods to help build a fuller picture of its shoppers' spending habits. The move would enable Tesco to \"get to know our customers better still, and use that understanding to deliver an even more personalised offer\", said Clarke who said one outcome would be personalised promotions when a shopper browses its website.",

      "bodyText": "Cyprus has become the fifth eurozone country to seek outside financial help to shore up its ailing economy after a day of heavy selling on financial markets prompted by fear that this week's European summit will end without a blueprint to rescue the single currency. The government in Nicosia admitted that it had been caught in the backwash from the crisis in neighbouring Greece as it formally applied to Brussels for assistance. On a day when Fitch cut Cyprus's credit rating to junk, a statement said: \"The purpose of the required assistance is to contain the risks to the Cypriot economy, notably those arising from the negative spill-over effects through its financial section, due to its large exposure in the Greek economy.\" The news followed an announcement in Athens that Vassilis Rapanos, the man appointed to be finance minister in the new coalition government, had quit without formally taking up his office, while the prime minister Antonis Samaras was not fit enough to travel to the Brussels summit after an eye operation. Markets were also unsettled by comments by Angela Merkel which doused hopes that this week's talks would agree to radical proposals for a full eurozone banking union, common eurobonds and the use of Europe's bailout funds to recapitalise banks directly. The German chancellor said sharing debt liability would be \"economically wrong\". Although the German finance ministry believes a euro collapse could result in a 10% contraction in Europe's biggest economy, Berlin is insisting that eurozone member states must give up full autonomy over their budgets and the running of their banks in return for a deal. In London, the FTSE 100 index closed down 63 points at 5451, the French CAC dropped 64 points to 3027 and Germany's Dax finished 112 points lower at 6152. The biggest falls on European bourses were in Milan, where the FTSE MIB slid 549 points to 13,114 and in Madrid, where the Ibex shed 252 points to 6624. With rumours that Moody's was poised to downgrade Spain's banks for the second time in a month, Wall Street's Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by more than 160 points in morning trading, while the price of Brent crude dropped below $90 a barrel due to concerns that the global economy is heading for a synchronised slowdown. Cyprus is one of the smallest of the 17 members of monetary union and is expected to need a bailout of several billion euros to finance its debt payments and rescue its banks. It follows Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Spain in seeking formal help from the bailout funds set up by Brussels in response to the sovereign debt crisis. Spain finally made its formal request for bailout money from the European Union on Monday, with a letter that failed to mention the amount needed and left markets guessing many of the details of how the country's troubled banks will be rescued. The slow process of putting together the bailout of up to \u20ac100bn should see a memorandum signed at a meeting of eurozone finance ministers on 9 July. Spain asked for the money to go to its FROB bank rescue fund, increasing the national debt. But the country's foreign minister, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Garc\u00eda-Margallo, added to confusion about the bailout process on Monday, saying Spain had not given up on its battle to have the money go directly to banks, without adding to the national debt. \"The question of whether the money will go directly to the banks or to the state is still open,\" he said. It was unclear how much of the \u20ac100bn bailout money Spain would finally ask for, and when it would be needed. El Pa\u00eds newspaper suggested on Mondayyesterday that the government would ask for money as the needs of each bank became clear. With a further round of stress tests on individual banks not due until September, some of the money might not be requested until after that. Officials from the Spanish government and the Bank of Spain have repeatedly said the bailout funds are not needed urgently. They have also stressed that the \u20ac62bn top figure provided last week by two independent auditors of Spain's banking system would cover against a severe downturn in the next three years \u2013 suggesting their request may not go much higher than that. Monday's letter requesting the loan said the amount \"would be sufficient to cover capital necessities as well as an additional margin of security\". Analysts warned Spain against aiming too low. \"It is essential that the loan provided exceeds by a certain margin the estimated capital requirements for the banks,\" said Vincent Forest of the Economist Intelligence Unit. \"Anything too far from the announced \u20ac100bn could fail to reassure investors, and create further volatility and instability.\" EU commissioner Olli Rehn said a deal on loan terms could be concluded within weeks.",

      "bodyText": "A new week, a new eurozone summit. Signs of deja-vu are creeping in (and not just because of another England defeat on penalties) as Thursday and Friday's meeting approaches. However, usually, the markets are cautiously optimistic at the start of any \"big\" week for the EU, but today the signs were far more muted as across Europe, markets opened down. The FTSE 100 is down 29 points, 0.5%, at 5484,French CAC down 33, 1%, at 3058, German DAX down 72, 1.2%, at 6191, Spanish IBEX down 126, 1.8%, at 6750 and Italian FTSE MIB down 311, 2.3%, at 13351. The bond market's biggest change was Spain's 10 year was up 14 basis points at 6.49%, but some way off recent highs above 7%. In company news, the biggest faller by a distance \u2013 and continuing to plunge \u2013 is drug maker Shire, down 241p, 12.3%, at \u00a317.25. The pharmaceutical business rose last week after rival Pfizer had one of its latest drugs rejected by European regulators. But now it's Shire's turn, which has suffered after the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US gave approval to a generic version of one of its drugs. Elsewhere, Morrisons' financial director of seven years, Richard Pennycook, is stepping down in June 2013 to \"concentrate on building a portfolio career\", sending shares down 5.8p, 2.2%, at 262.7p. It brings to an end a miserable few weeks for the supermarket, after posting a 1% fall in first-quarter sales, and former chief executive Sir Ken Morrison publicly criticised the current management team for losing touch with customers, with stores becoming too upmarket. Recent data also showed it suffered a 0.4% fall in market share, while rivals Asda and Sainsbury's grew. Meanwhile, over at Natwest, bosses of parent company Royal Bank of Scotland, say the computer glitch which left customers without access to their money or unable to pay staff and bills is over. However, despite opening branches on a Sunday for the first time ever, shares took a dent, down 3.3p, 1.4%, at 239.9p. The risers included mining firms, Polymetal, up 18.5p, 1.8%, at 930.5p, and Randgold Resources, up 95p, 1.7%, at \u00a357.69, but after suffering heavy falls at the end of last week, they still have some catching up to do to recover. Rolls Royce was up 4.5p, 0.5%, at 845p on unconfirmed reports from the weekend papers that the company is seeking a new chairman to replace Simon Robertson, who may step down next year. And finally, in the small caps, AIM-listed clean fuel firm ITM Power was up an impressive 6.6p, 12.4%, to 58.4p, after announcing it has sold its first hydrogen generation system to the European Aeronautic Defense and Space Company (EADS).",
