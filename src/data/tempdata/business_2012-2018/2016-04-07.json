      "bodyText": "Richard Pennycook, chief executive of the Co-operative Group, has asked for a 60% cut in his multimillion-pound pay package \u2013 but the much trumpeted change will not complete until next year, the Guardian has established. The mutual announced with great fanfare on Thursday that Pennycook, who earned a total of \u00a33.59m last year including an annual bonus of \u00a31.12m, had asked to reduce his salary and rewards package by 60%. The company said the cut came after the rescue of the business had finished and the rebuild was \u201cwell under way\u201d. It also comes after Co-op members protested against high executive pay at last year\u2019s annual meeting. A prominent chart in the Co-op\u2019s annual report published on Wednesday indicates Pennycook\u2019s total rewards will fall to \u00a31.5m. Allan Leighton, chairman of the group, said: \u201cThe move by Richard to reduce his pay shows the Co-op difference in action, as we champion a better way to do business for our members and their communities.\u201d But analysis of the report reveals that Pennycook is still in line for total rewards of just over \u00a33m this year. A planned cut in basic salary from \u00a31.25m to \u00a3750,000 does not take effect until July, halfway through the company\u2019s financial year. Reductions in potential bonuses for Pennycook do not begin until 2017. This year, the former Morrisons executive can earn up to 200% of his salary in annual and long-term bonuses if he meets performance criteria. From 2017, that potential annual bonus will be reduced to 40% of salary and the lon-term incentive bonus will fall to 50% of salary \u2013 both currently stand at 100%. A source close to the Co-op admitted that the information on Pennycook\u2019s pay package was not easy to understand, but added: \u201cWe have tried our best to be as clear as possible in a complex situation.\u201d Confusion over the pay package comes after a long history of disputes over executive remuneration at the Co-op. Last year, about a third of members failed to back the company\u2019s pay report in protest at multimillion-pound payouts to executives. Former chief executive Euan Sutherland left after a leak to the Observer revealed the Co-op planned to pay him more than \u00a33.5m in his first year in the job despite the group\u2019s \u00a32.3bn losses. Hefty salaries for Pennycook and other executives are likely to prove controversial for Co-op members at the annual general meeting in May. This year\u2019s annual report reveals \u00a31m-plus pay packages for the Co-op food business boss, Steve Murrells, its chief operating officer, Pippa Wicks, the general counsel, Alistair Asher, and the consumer services chief, Rod Bulmer. Consultancy AlixPartners was paid \u00a31.25m for the services of Wicks, with Murrells earning \u00a32.2m and Asher \u00a31.4m. Jim Lee, a former secretary of the Scottish Co-operative party and long-term Co-op activist, said: \u201cWe recognise that there\u2019s a market in retail managers but nonetheless this pay seems to be exceptionally high.\u201d He suggested that executive pay should be limited to a multiple of that earned by the lowest-paid workers within the Co-op and that members should be given more say over remuneration. Leighton said: \u201cI don\u2019t think Richard Pennycook was paid too much at all. The pay everybody received was for rescuing this organisation that was long gone and dead and the fact we can sit here today and say the business is growing and confident about the future.\u201d The Co-op revealed a 10% rise in underlying profits to \u00a381m in the year to 2 January, as sales and profits rose in its grocery store and funeral care businesses. Sales and profits fell at its insurance, legal services and online electrical products divisions. Total sales at the 2,800-store Co-op chain were steady at \u00a37bn as it closed 91 larger stores and opened 97 smaller ones. Underlying sales, which strip out the impact of openings and closures, rose 1.6% as the company said shoppers were welcoming \u00a3155m of price cuts and improvements in own-label products. This year the company plans to open a further 100 small stores and close or sell off a similar number as well as investing in improving the quality of own-label products and another \u00a345m in price cuts. Murrells said: \u201cFor most of last year deflation [in the food market] was running at 1.5% and I see nothing to suggest that\u2019s going to ease up.\u201d Funeralcare revenues rose 9.9% to \u00a3399m. The Co-op said high death rates meant it had the busiest year since 2008. Underlying profits rose 18.2% to \u00a378m, with 25 funeral homes opened. The group plans to open a further 200 homes over the next three years, taking the total to 1,100.",

The mutual\u2019s annual report revealed it has the right to exercise an option from September under which the travel agent must buy the mutual\u2019s 30% stake for \u00a350m. Under the deal agreed in 2010, Thomas Cook also agreed to pay the Co-op \u00a332m of minimum guaranteed dividends between October and December this year. The original total was \u00a337m and just \u00a35m has been paid so far. The Central England Co-operative, formerly the Midlands Co-operative, will also be in line for payments of at least \u00a35m relating to its separate 3.5% stake in the joint venture. The potential payouts come at a difficult time for Thomas Cook, which has suffered from troubles in Tunisia and Egypt. If the buyout goes ahead the Co-op brand must be removed from the venture\u2019s 230 stores over the following two years, under the terms of the original agreement. That will mean a refurb of a quarter of Thomas Cook\u2019s travel agency estate. The Co-op has yet to decide whether to exercise the option, but is considered almost certain to do so and the travel agent has made provision for the total payout. Thomas Cook\u2019s provision means that profits, expected to hit about \u00a3205m this year, will not be affected by the multimillion-pound payout that will fall into the group\u2019s next financial year, starting in September. It will mean a potential squeeze on cash, however. Mark Brumby, a leisure analyst at Langton Capital, said: \u201cIt\u2019s fair to say this comes at a difficult time.

      "bodyText": "There is a secret to being the new broom in a company that has been struggling: dissociate yourself from past failures as fast as you can. In that respect, Steve Rowe has got off to the best possible start as the chief executive of Marks &amp; Spencer. His comment that the performance of the key clothing division had been \u201cunsatisfactory\u201d is the sort of breezy honesty that works well when it is your first day in the job. Particularly when it has the merit of being true. The hard numbers support the anecdotal evidence from once loyal M&amp;S customers who now shop elsewhere: the product range has been uninspired and overpriced. One quarterly increase in clothing sales in the past five years tells its own story. The performance of the clothing and homewares division was once again poor in the three-month period to the end of March, but the City was expecting the fall to be bigger than 2.7%, especially after the recent gloom from Next boss Lord Wolfson. Margins were up because M&amp;S has avoided blanket discounting, and the analysts liked that. So where does that leave the new boss at M&amp;S? Clothing has been the retailer\u2019s achilles heel for the past decade as sales either grew at the expense of profit margins or vice versa. Rowe needs to be able to conjure both while restoring M&amp;S to a place in the hearts of the once faithful. Rowe is keeping his powder dry for next month\u2019s full-year results when he promised to reveal more of his ideas to reinvigorate the business. There were some early signs of common sense though, such as cutting the price of 300 of the new spring lines \u2013 an admission they were out of whack with high street rivals. The idea appears to be to woo customers with the lure of more keenlypriced clothes in the hope that they will be impressed by the improvement in the quality of what is on offer. Rowe has made a good start. But it is only a start \u2013 it is not hard to knock a couple of pounds off a pair of leggings. M&amp;S has been pledging to improve its clothing range for years and it hasn\u2019t happened. The hard work starts now. The UK\u2019s productivity slump goes on \u2013 and on Eight years have passed since the economy plunged into recession and during that time there has not been any improvement in the UK\u2019s productivity. Workers produced less in the final three months of 2015 than they did in the first quarter of 2008. In the fourth quarter of 2015, productivity dropped by 1.2% on the previous three months. Never in modern times has productivity been so weak for so long. Trend growth in productivity in the years leading up to the crisis was in the region of 2% a year. And since productivity is the driving force behind improvements in real incomes, that meant living standards increased by 2% a year also. The Office for National Statistics says productivity is now 14% below where it would have been had that pre-crisis trend continued. Broken down by sector, there have been some notably poor performances. Finance and insurance, where productivity growth averaged 4% a year in the decade and a half leading up to the crisis has averaged -1% a year in the eight years since. Manufacturing productivity growth has dropped from 3.1% a year to 0.4% a year; in the IT sector it has fallen from 4.3% to 1.3%. Some of the productivity problem is sector specific. The City, for example, generates less revenue and employs more people in back-office jobs. The offshore sector has been affected by the decline in oil and gas production from the North Sea. But economy-wide factors have also been at play. There has been insufficient investment and a continued failure to spend enough on R&amp;D or, put simply, poorlytrained and badlyled workers are operating with bits of kit that should have been upgraded some time ago. French joint-venture points the way The French president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, has not had a lot of good news lately but he has been cheered by the decision of the Swiss firm MSC Cruises to build four liners in a French shipyard at Saint-Nazaire. The yard nearly closed in 2012 but was saved when the French government took a one-third stake in a joint-venture with the South Korean group STX. It now has orders that will secure its future well into the next decade. A lesson for David Cameron here, perhaps?",

Particularly when it has the merit of being true.</p> <p>The hard numbers support the anecdotal evidence from once loyal M&amp;S customers who now shop elsewhere: the product range has been uninspired and overpriced. One quarterly increase in clothing sales in the past five years tells its own story.</p> <p>The performance of the clothing and homewares division was once again poor in the three-month period to the end of March, but the City was expecting the fall to be bigger than 2.7%, especially after the recent gloom from Next boss Lord Wolfson. Margins were up because M&amp;S has avoided blanket discounting, and the analysts liked that.</p> <p>So where does that leave the new boss at M&amp;S? Clothing has been the retailer\u2019s achilles heel for the past decade as sales either grew at the expense of profit margins or vice versa. Rowe needs to be able to conjure both while restoring M&amp;S to a place in the hearts of the once faithful.</p> <p>Rowe is keeping his powder dry for next month\u2019s full-year results when he promised to reveal more of his ideas to reinvigorate the business.</p> <p>There were some early signs of common sense though, such as cutting the price of 300 of the new spring lines \u2013 an admission they were out of whack with high street rivals.</p> <p>The idea appears to be to woo customers with the lure of more keenlypriced clothes in the hope that they will be impressed by the improvement in the quality of what is on offer.<br></p> <p>Rowe has made a good start. But it is only a start \u2013 it is not hard to knock a couple of pounds off a pair of leggings. M&amp;S has been pledging to improve its clothing range for years and it hasn\u2019t happened. The hard work starts now.</p> <h2>The UK\u2019s productivity slump goes on \u2013 and on</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aa53ba86a5c78c7040b521adf4312d489770282e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aa53ba86a5c78c7040b521adf4312d489770282e/0_134_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Church spires and skyscrapers in the City of London\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The finance and insurance industries have averaged -1% a year productivity growth since the recession.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Toby Melville/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Eight years have passed since the economy plunged into recession and during that time there has not been any improvement in the UK\u2019s productivity. Workers produced less in the final three months of 2015 than they did in the first quarter of 2008. <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/labourproductivity/bulletins/labourproductivity/octtodec201\">In the fourth quarter of 2015, productivity dropped by 1.2% on the previous three months.</a></p> <p>Never in modern times has productivity been so weak for so long. Trend growth in productivity in the years leading up to the crisis was in the region of 2% a year. And since productivity is the driving force behind improvements in real incomes, that meant living standards increased by 2% a year also.</p> <p>The Office for National Statistics says productivity is now 14% below where it would have been had that pre-crisis trend continued.</p> <p><a href=\"http://budgetresponsibility.org.uk/efo/economic-fiscal-outlook-march-2016/\">Broken down by sector</a>, there have been some notably poor performances. Finance and insurance, where productivity growth averaged 4% a year in the decade and a half leading up to the crisis has averaged -1% a year in the eight years since. Manufacturing productivity growth has dropped from 3.1% a year to 0.4% a year; in the IT sector it has fallen from 4.3% to 1.3%.</p> <p>Some of the productivity problem is sector specific. The City, for example, generates less revenue and employs more people in back-office jobs. The offshore sector has been affected by the decline in oil and gas production from the North Sea.</p> <p>But economy-wide factors have also been at play. There has been insufficient investment and a continued failure to spend enough on R&amp;D or, put simply, poorlytrained and badlyled workers are operating with bits of kit that should have been upgraded some time ago.</p> <h2>French joint-venture points the way</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c788285bb02d0901614a51293439adbdf4e4f1b5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c788285bb02d0901614a51293439adbdf4e4f1b5/0_235_4256_2554/1000.jpg\" alt=\"MSC Divina liner under construction in Saint-Nazaire\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">France\u2019s stake in the once-ailing Saint-Nazaire shipyard could offer clues to saving Port Talbot.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Frank Perry/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The French president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, has not had a lot of good news lately but he has been cheered by the decision of the Swiss firm MSC Cruises to build four liners in a French shipyard at Saint-Nazaire.</p> <p>The yard nearly closed in 2012 but was saved when the French government took a one-third stake in a joint-venture with the South Korean group STX. It now has orders that will secure its future well into the next decade. A lesson for David Cameron here, perhaps?</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Indian metals tycoon who has emerged as a potential saviour of Tata\u2019s UK steel business has admitted that his company is yet to decide whether to make a bid and needs to \u201cexamine very carefully\u201d any proposal. Doubts are growing as to whether Sanjeev Gupta and Liberty House have the resources to rescue the Port Talbot steelworks and Tata\u2019s other sites without substantial financial support from the government. Gupta made the comments as a thinktank warned that finding any buyer will be \u201cdifficult\u201d and it would cost the government \u00a34.6bn in tax revenue and benefits as well as \u00a33bn in reduced household spending if Tata\u2019s sites were to close. The IPPR said that if 40,000 jobs are lost at Tata and the rest of the steel industry as a result of the crisis, this would cost the government \u00a32.2m a day in the first year. The figure includes the loss of income tax and VAT, and additional benefit payments. Alfie Stirling, a research fellow at IPPR, said: \u201cThe effects of plant closures on the UK could be very serious indeed. Our new analysis shows that there is significant fiscal and economic cost to inaction, which the government must take account of when considering its options for Tata Steel.\u201d Analysts in India for investment bank Macquarie warned that it would be difficult to find a buyer and said Tata faces \u201cvery high costs\u201d if it mothballs the sites. In a brutal analysis of the UK steel industry, Rakesh Arora said Port Talbot had no future. \u201cTata Steel has rightly decided to put a stop to investing in these loss-making assets, as structural issues such as high labour, energy and regulatory costs make them unviable even over the longer term,\u201d he said. \u201cWe think the possibility of a new buyer turning these assets around is also slim, as we saw with the Teesside facility [which SSI closed last year] and can be gauged from the prolonged discussion around the sale of its long product business [in Scunthorpe]. \u201cPort Talbot has little future for its blast furnaces and will have to be ultimately shut down. Steelmaking in the UK under the current spread of steel and raw material makes no sense to us at all. \uf0a7 \u201cThe rolling business could have some takers but will require serious concessions from the government, mothballing of lots of facilities and large workforce layoffs. Who is going to assume the restructuring costs? We expect no new buyer will agree to it and the onus will fall either on Tata Steel or the UK government. We believe zero cost is the only best case outcome here for Tata Steel.\u201d Sajid Javid, the business secretary, spent Thursday afternoon in talks with management and workers at the Port Talbot plant, who could try to launch a management buyout if they secure a financial backer. Javid was updating staff on his meeting with the Tata chairman, Cyrus Mistry, in Mumbai on Wednesday. He confirmed that the sales process for Tata\u2019s operations will officially begin by Monday and said other parties apart from Gupta have expressed an interest in buying the steel business. The other potential bidders are investment company Greybull, German industrial conglomerate ThyssenKrupp and the possible management buyout. Javid has already held talks with Gupta about his proposals. The Liberty founder told the Guardian that it is still \u201cvery early days\u201d in the process and admitted that any deal would be a \u201cbig step forward\u201d for his company. Tata Steel employs 15,000 people in the UK, including about 4,000 at Port Talbot. Filings at Companies House show that Liberty\u2019s UK business recorded less than $60m (\u00a343m) of sales in 2014, the most recent accounts, and it has twice been threatened with being struck off the register of UK companies for posting accounts late. \u201cIt is something we will examine very carefully before we actually take it on. It is big step forward for us, there is no denying that,\u201d Gupta said. \u201cThere is no definite in anything, it is very early days. We have to engage with Tata, we have to then make a proposition. I believe we will make a proposition but that proposition has to be accepted and it depends on who else we are competing against and what ideas they have. This a competitive process and it\u2019s not necessarily only our model that works.\u201d Gupta\u2019s plan involves converting the blast furnaces at Port Talbot into electric arc furnaces that convert scrap steel into new products. The tycoon has said he will try to avoid redundancies. However, the government and unions are keen to preserve the blast furnaces at Port Talbot, which can produce more steel than arc furnaces, and the transition from blast to arc would require substantial financial support. Gupta said the \u201conly differentiating factor\u201d in his potential bid is the need for competitively priced power, with any buyer needing support for Tata\u2019s pension liabilities of almost \u00a315bn. The Liberty managing director said this support could involve backing the Swansea tidal lagoon project, which Gupta part owns. The project has been criticised for being too expensive, but Gupta said the government should allow it to bid for a price support contract in the upcoming contract for difference auction. These auctions involve the government offering subsidies to energy projects that can offer the most capacity at the lowest price. Gupta said the government is \u201ccommitted\u201d to finding a solution for Port Talbot. \u201cI mean, we don\u2019t yet have a detailed proposition from them, but our feeling is that they are committed to finding a solution, including finding a solution to power,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know about money because they said they can\u2019t do anything which constitutes state aid, so they won\u2019t be able to give anybody money per se. But they can solve problems like power or they can provide commercial loans and things, but they can\u2019t actually give money, that\u2019s against EU regulations.\u201d The Labour MP Stephen Kinnock, whose constituency covers Port Talbot, welcomed Gupta\u2019s interest but questioned the credibility of his plan. Kinnock told the BBC\u2019s Today programme that the blast furnaces at Port Talbot are technologically advanced and replacing them would lead to job losses. \u201cThe proposals Mr Gupta has outlined are very interesting indeed. I\u2019m going to be meeting with him very soon. But there are quite interesting ideas bubbling under and we need to make sure we don\u2019t rush to something because the government is in such a shambles,\u201d he said.",

Since the release of its chic pink coat in 2013, the retailer has successfully introduced a statement piece each season and has done a good job of promoting it (for example, it produced a faux suede version of its own skirt, a meta and brilliant move \u2013 I bought it). This season\u2019s \u201cit\u201d item is likely to be the Autograph leather wrap skirt. The belted A-line number is on-trend and expensive enough to feel like a luxe purchase. Perhaps therein lies the problem \u2013 if you are going to spend more than \u00a3100 on a skirt, would you go to M&amp;S? If you\u2019re young, would you opt for Autograph instead of Topshop? And while the Autograph and Limited Edition collections tend to be carefully curated and promoted, these lines comprise only a fraction of the clothing M&amp;S produces. In short, why would fashion-focused shoppers want to go to Marks &amp; Spencer? What should help lift sales is the forthcoming Alexa line, which is aimed at young women. Given Alexa Chung\u2019s status, I have no doubt it will sell out. In the end, though, M&amp;S will need to pick a side \u2013 it wants to attract younger shoppers but what it offers them is limited and available in only a few stores. However, if it wants to retain older consumers, the retailer must slash its prices to better compete with the rest of the high street.",

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s it for today folks. Thank you for reading and commenting and please join us again tomorrow morning for more rolling news. Dow Jones: -0.5% at 17,633.18 S&amp;P 500: -0.4% at 2,058.38 Nasdaq: -0.6% at 4,893.24 Investors appear to be jittery about the global outlook and general uncertainty about when the Fed might next raise rates. John McDonnell, Labour\u2019s shadow chancellor, has commented on those weak UK productivity numbers: Latest productivity figures showing the largest quarterly fall since 2008 are deeply concerning. It comes only weeks after the Office for Budget Responsibility revised down forecasts for growth due to weak productivity expectations throughout this Parliament. George Osborne has been chancellor for six years now and has made almost no progress with what may be the biggest challenge facing Britain\u2019s economy. It\u2019s about time he listened to the coalition of voices calling for more investment in infrastructure, to boost productivity, as well as addressing the skills shortage which is being reported by employers across the economy. The number of people claiming for unemployment benefits in America dropped more than expected last week. New jobless claims fell 9,000 to 267,000 (seasonally adjusted) for the week ended 2 April, the US Labor Department said. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a smaller fall to 270,000. New jobless claims have now been below the 300,000 mark for 57 weeks - the longest run since 1973. Despite the apparent strength of the US labour market, Fed policymakers are in cautious mode and are not expected to raise interest rates in April. Reaction to the ECB minutes... Jonathan Loynes, chief European economist at Capital Economics: The minutes of the ECB\u2019s monetary policy meeting on March 10th may reinforce concerns that the Governing Council is starting to run out of ammunition. There appears to have been broad support for the package of measures unveiled at the meeting... However, there were differences of opinion about the merits of the different components, with some members expressing concerns over some of the side-effects e.g. the effect of more negative interest rates on banks\u2019 profitability. A few members \u2013 presumably led by the Bundesbank\u2019s Jens Weidmann \u2013 also objected to the expansion of asset purchases. There was broader support for the TLTROs. We don\u2019t think any of this rules out further action from the ECB altogether. With the economic recovery slowing and the euro rising, officials have already stressed since the meeting that interest rates could fall further and other measures are possible. Accordingly, we still think that a further extension of the APP is likely at some point and would not entirely rule out more drastic measures such as some form of \u201chelicopter drop\u201d. Howard Archer, chief European economist at IHS Global Insight: Having delivered a major package of measures in March, we believe the ECB will now likely remain in \u201cwait and see\u201d mode for an extended period. Nevertheless, senior ECB policymakers have actually been out in force on Thursday indicating that the ECB is willing and able to take further stimulative action should it deem it necessary. For example, ECB President Draghi stated that \u201cthe ECB does not surrender to excessively low inflation\u201d. Should the ECB eventually feel the need to undertake more stimulus, it does seem most likely that this would be in the form of more QE or liquidity measures than further interest rate cuts. Following on from Mario Draghi\u2019s gloomy comments published in the ECB\u2019s annual report earlier today, minutes from the governing council\u2019s latest meeting have been released. The minutes reveal that governing council members were broadly supportive of the additional stimulus measures announced in March. Measures included cutting the main interest rate to zero from 0.05%, and cutting the deposit rate by 10 basis points to -0.4%. From the minutes: Taking into account the views expressed by the members of the governing council, the president concluded that a large majority of voting members supported the proposed policy package. Some members were concerned however about the limitations of monetary policy, and reiterated the need for governments to play their part in boosting activity through fiscal policy and reforms. Overall, the recovery in the euro area economy was expected to continue at a more subdued pace, while the risks to the growth outlook were mostly seen to remain tilted to the downside. These risks related in particular to the heightened uncertainties regarding the external environment and to broader geopolitical risks. Against this background, members reiterated the necessity for other policy areas to support sustained output growth and that monetary policy on its own was not sufficient. There was a need for both structural reforms and fiscal policy to also play their part. The yen has hit a 17-month high against the dollar, following the Fed\u2019s cautious stance revealed in the FOMC minutes. The yen is up around 9.5% against the dollar this year, despite negative rates in Japan. The dollar fell 1.4% to 108.02 yen. ING currency strategist Petr Krpata: We are in a broad based soft dollar environment, and given the yen is cheap in relation to its long-term fundamentals, it is not surprising it is outperforming. #sausagegate Dublin Airport is pressing ahead with plans for a second runway, in a sign of Ireland\u2019s reviving fortunes. The second, 3,110 metre runway, is expected to be ready in 2020. Dublin Airport originally received planning permission for a second runway in August 2007, but the plans were shelved as the global economy plunged into crisis and Ireland was hit hard. In a statement on Thursday, the airport\u2019s operator DAA, said the recovery in passenger numbers - particularly in the past two years - had been \u201csignificant\u201d. DAA chief executive Kevin Toland: Last year was the busiest year ever in the airport\u2019s history with a record 25 million passengers travelling in 2015. Passenger numbers continue to grow strongly in 2016 with double digit growth recorded in the first two months of this year. The north runway will significantly improve Ireland\u2019s connectivity which plays a critical role in growing passenger numbers and sustaining the future economic development of Ireland. A US recession is now \u201cvirtually inevitable\u201d according to Societe Generale\u2019s resident bear, Albert Edwards. Edwards says his failsafe recession indicator has turned to red, giving a very gloomy view of the world\u2019s largest economy and its policymakers. Despite risk assets enjoying a few weeks in the sun our failsafe recession indicator has stopped flashing amber and turned to red. Newly released US whole economy profits data show a gut wrenching slump. Whole economy profits never normally fall this deeply without a recession unfolding. And with the US corporate sector up to its eyes in debt, the one asset class to be avoided \u2013 even more so than the ridiculously overvalued equity market - is US corporate debt. The economy will surely be swept away by a tidal wave of corporate default. I suppose now the S&amp;P has recovered we are about to go through another turn on the monetary/market merry-go-round. Ignore this noise. Recent whole economy profits data show that while the Fed plays its games, the economic cycle is withering and writhing from within. For historically, when whole economy profits fall this deeply, recession is virtually inevitable as business spending slumps. And if I had to pick one asset class to avoid it would be US corporate bonds, for which sky high default rates will shock investors. Earlier gains have faded away and most indices are slightly down. The FTSE 100 is down just a touch (4 points) at 6,157. David Morrison, senior market strategist at Spread Co, says fears over the strengthening yen are damaging investor confidence. European equities and US stock index futures are coming off their best levels following yesterday\u2019s sharp oil-inspired rally. While crude prices have held on to recent gains, boosted to a great extent by a surprise drop in US inventories, traders are looking past these this morning and worrying about FX moves. Specifically their concerns focus on the relentless surge in the Japanese yen. The currency is sharply higher again this morning. The rally has gained momentum since the USDJPY broke decisively below 110.00 yesterday and the euro is also sharply lower against the yen this morning. No doubt there was some disappointment that in a speech overnight Bank of Japan governor Haruhiko Kuroda said nothing new about Japan\u2019s economic outlook or monetary policy. But the real fear is that Japan\u2019s policymakers are losing control of the situation and will be unable to counter the yen\u2019s rally. This is a serious concern given Japan\u2019s tepid growth, parlous debt load and inability to create inflation. The European Central Bank is prepared to inject more stimulus if necessary, according to top policymakers. Writing in the ECB\u2019s annual report, the bank\u2019s president Mario Draghi said 2016 would be another challenging year. We face uncertainty about the outlook for the global economy. We face continued disinflationary forces. And we face questions about the direction of Europe and its resilience to new shocks. Meanwhile the ECB\u2019s chief economist, Peter Praet, told an audience of economists in Frankfurt that the bank stood ready to do more: If further adverse shocks were to materialise, our measures could be recalibrated once more commensurate with the strength of the headwind. UK productivity slumped in the final quarter of 2015 according to the latest official figures. Output per hour fell 1.2% in the last three months of the year, compared with the previous quarter. It was the biggest drop since the end of 2008, and reversed a 0.6% in the third quarter. It will come as a blow to Treasury officials and policymakers at the Bank of England, who have been scratching their heads over Britain\u2019s poor productivity performance and hoping for a turnaround. UK productivity growth has lagged that of most major economies since the financial crisis, and last month the Office for Budget Responsibility (the government\u2019s independent forecaster) revised down its forecasts. Unit labour costs were also lower than expected, up 1.3% in the fourth quarter compared with a year earlier. Economists were expecting a 1.9% increase. Alan Clarke, economist at Scotiabank, said the data reinforced the view that the Bank of England will not be raising interest rates any time soon. The market seems to be taking this in its stride, which is understandable. The Brexit vote has tied the BoE\u2019s hands for the time being. If an imminent rate hike was on a knife edge, this data release would have just pushed the hike into the long grass. But with a rate hike a distant prospect, this release merely confirms the market thinking. If the Bank\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee weren\u2019t in a rush to hike rates before, they won\u2019t be after this release. Over in Germany, the latest Daimler AGM took a rather unsavoury turn when two shareholders had a row over the buffet sausages and police were called. The free food at company AGMs has long been a draw for shareholders but Daimler could not have predicted events as the luxury car maker announced a record dividend. Things turned nasty when one shareholder apparently accused another of being too greedy by attempting to pocket several sausages. The sausages in question were Saitenwuerschtle, from the carmaker\u2019s home state of Baden Wuerttemberg. Daimler provided 12,500 sausages for about 5,500 shareholders who attended the meeting, so just over two per person. When one shareholder was caught wrapping up several sausages to apparently take away with him, he was confronted by another and a shouting match began, resulting in the police being called. Daimler board chairman Manfred Bischoff confirmed the incident. We had to call the police to settle the matter. Either we need more sausages or we drop the sausages completely. #sausagegate A little more on the new M&amp;S boss Steve Rowe. Making his debut with an underwhelming trading update, he told journalists he wants to take a straightforward approach to how he leads the business. For starters, he his getting rid of the term \u201cgeneral merchandise\u201d (replacing it with \u201cclothing and home\u201d), which can only be a good thing. Rowe might be new to the top job but he first started working for M&amp;S at the Croydon store on Saturdays, aged 15. Read our piece - From Saturday boy to big boss - here. Steve Rowe, the man newly in charge of Marks &amp; Spencer, has given his first trading update since taking over the top job on Saturday. Clothing sales fell again over the most recent quarter (they have risen in only quarter over the past five years). Rowe said the performance of its clothing business was \u201cunsatisfactory\u201d and turning it around was his \u201cnumber one priority\u201d. Like-for-like clothing and home sales were down by 2.7% in the 13 weeks to 26 March. Nevertheless M&amp;S is one of the top risers on the FTSE this morning, with shares up 1.9% at 428.4p, because the City was expecting a bigger drop in clothing sales. Food sales were flat over the quarter. Read our full story on the trading update here. Europe\u2019s main markets are mostly up this morning, boosted by the Fed\u2019s signal that it is in no immediate hurry to raise rates again. Brent crude oil prices rose above $40 a barrel earlier but are now down a touch at $39.82. Now for some reaction to those Fed minutes. As always its a case of reading between the lines and much of the language is open to interpretation. Steve Murphy, US economist at Capital Economics: Although the minutes acknowledge that a few officials were ready to raise interest rates in April, many thought that the Fed should precede more cautiously, in particular because of worries about global downside risks. At this stage, the chances of an April rate hike are very slim, but we expect the Fed will resume raising rates in June. By that time, fears surrounding global risks should have faded and further increases in core inflation will have convinced officials that the pick-up is in fact genuine. Thereafter, we expect the fed funds rate will end this year at between 1.00% and 1.25%. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK: As suspected the US Federal Reserve\u2019s FOMC minutes painted a picture of a divided central bank, but what was clear is that [while] there is some appetite to pull the trigger on a rate rise in April it is a sentiment that is not shared amongst the majority of the voting members on the committee. \u201cA range of views\u201d was expressed about the likelihood of a move in April, but it is clear that policymakers are concerned about the volatility that has rippled through markets for a good part of this year. Reading between the lines this makes the prospect of a move in April unlikely and hasn\u2019t shifted the dial higher on the odds of a June hike either, with markets assigning a 19.6% probability of a move before the publication of the minutes, and a 17.6% probability afterwards. Good morning and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets and business. The US Federal Reserve is unlikely to raise interest rates at its April meeting, the latest minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) suggest. Chaired by Janet Yellen, the committee was clearly divided. Some members judged improving data suggested the US economy was ready for another rate hike. Others were more wary, fearful of recent trends in the global economy where risks appear to be mounting. Overall, the tone was cautious: A number of participants judged that the headwinds restraining growth and holding down the neutral rate of interest were likely to subside only slowly. In light of this expectation and their assessment of the risks to the economic outlook, several expressed the view that a cautious approach to raising rates would be prudent or noted their concern that raising the target range as soon as April would signal a sense of urgency they did not think appropriate. In contrast, some other participants indicated that an increase in the target range at the Committee\u2019s next meeting might well be warranted if the incoming economic data remained consistent with their expectations for moderate growth in output, further strengthening of the labor market, and inflation rising to 2% over the medium term. US markets rose: Dow Jones: +0.6% at 17,716.05 S&amp;P 500: +1% at 2,066.66 Markets this morning await the latest minutes from the European Central Bank.",

However, there were differences of opinion about the merits of the different components, with some members expressing concerns over some of the side-effects e.g. the effect of more negative interest rates on banks\u2019 profitability. A few members \u2013 presumably led by the Bundesbank\u2019s Jens Weidmann \u2013 also objected to the expansion of asset purchases. There was broader support for the TLTROs.</p> <p>We don\u2019t think any of this rules out further action from the ECB altogether. With the economic recovery slowing and the euro rising, officials have already stressed since the meeting that interest rates could fall further and other measures are possible. Accordingly, we still think that a further extension of the APP is likely at some point and would not entirely rule out more drastic measures such as some form of \u201chelicopter drop\u201d. </p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Howard Archer, chief European economist at IHS Global Insight:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> Having delivered a major package of measures in March, we believe the ECB will now likely remain in \u201cwait and see\u201d mode for an extended period. <br></p> <p>Nevertheless, senior ECB policymakers have actually been out in force on Thursday indicating that the ECB is willing and able to take further stimulative action should it deem it necessary.</p> <p>For example, ECB President Draghi stated that \u201cthe ECB does not surrender to excessively low inflation\u201d.</p> <p>Should the ECB eventually feel the need to undertake more stimulus, it does seem most likely that this would be in the form of more QE or liquidity measures than further interest rate cuts.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57064ef3e4b04a7968a061d5\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-04-07T12:45:03.706Z\">1.45pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">ECB minutes: broad support for policy measures</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2cb028a15f0e9513acce7d2bed5645d3da26b416\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2cb028a15f0e9513acce7d2bed5645d3da26b416/0_0_2690_1884/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"700\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Following on from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/apr/07/us-fed-dampens-prospect-of-an-april-rate-rise-business-live?page=with:block-570628dee4b0c18a88913d5a#block-570628dee4b0c18a88913d5a\">Mario Draghi\u2019s gloomy comments</a> published in the ECB\u2019s annual report earlier today, <a href=\"https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/accounts/2016/html/mg160407.en.html\">minutes</a> from the governing council\u2019s latest meeting have been released. </p> <p>The minutes reveal that governing council members were broadly supportive of the additional <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/10/european-central-bank-cuts-interest-rates-zero-mario-draghi\">stimulus measures announced in March</a>.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A sharp drop in British productivity has cast further doubt over the country\u2019s economic prospects and will add to pressure on the government to prove its productivity plan can bear fruit. Official figures show labour productivity, as measured by output per hour, fell by 1.2% in the fourth quarter of 2015 from the third quarter, the biggest fall since the financial crisis in 2008. Underscoring Britain\u2019s sluggish productivity performance since the financial crisis, statisticians also said output per hour was 14% below where it would have been if pre-downturn trends had continued. That struggle to get more output out of each hour worked has left the UK lagging behind other advanced economies and raised concern about living standards as employers feel less able to raise pay. Output per hour drops The Office for National Statistics said that for 2015 as a whole, output per hour grew 1%, the best performance since 2011 and would have been stronger but for a jump in average hours worked in the final quarter of the year. Ministers will be hoping that the end of year productivity slump was a blip but economists expressed concern about the figures, which on the surface suggested British workers had increased their hours but failed to increase their output at the same time. Howard Archer, economist at IHS Global Insight said the relapse in productivity was \u201cdisappointing and worrying news for UK economic prospects. The crucial question for the UK economy is does the fourth quarter of 2015 mark a temporary relapse in productivity. Or is it evidence that the UK has an ongoing serious productivity problem.\u201d The British Chambers of Commerce said weak productivity was hampering the UK\u2019s overall economic growth. \u201cThere are deep-rooted structural problems in our economy that have dampened productivity \u2013 from skills shortages, to infrastructure bottlenecks and limited growth finance,\u201d said Suren Thiru, head of economics at the group. \u201cDelivering solutions to these critical issues would go a long way to achieving the productivity gains we need.\u201d But the Institute of Directors (IoD) warned against reading too much into the latest figures. \u201cThe key thing is not too get too worried about one statistic; there is no point in comparing ourselves to the pre-crisis productivity trend, which was a feature of a bubble about to pop,\u201d said its chief economist, James Sproule. The figures follow a gloomier outlook for the UK economy from the government\u2019s independent forecasters, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR). That downgrade, published alongside the chancellor George Osborne\u2019s March budget, was largely driven by what the OBR\u2019s experts saw as bleaker prospects for productivity growth. The government has vowed to address the UK\u2019s woeful productivity performance, which has left the gap with other leading western economies at the biggest since modern records began in the early 1990s. Output per hour worked in the UK was 18 percentage points below the average for the remaining six members of the G7 group of industrial nations in 2014, the Office for National Statistics reported in February. The business secretary, Sajid Javid, said last year that \u201cboosting productivity is the economic challenge of our age\u201d and the government launched a productivity plan in July 2015. But that plan was recently criticised by an influential committee of MPs for lacking clear goals and original ideas on how the UK can catch up with other advanced economies. The Commons business, innovation and skills committee questioned whether the plan was worthy of its name and urged the government to be bolder. Britain\u2019s failure to boost productivity since the downturn, known as the productivity puzzle, has also been a focus for the Bank of England as it seeks to work out how much businesses can raise output without piling up inflationary pressures. But policymakers were unlikely to be worried about inflation based on the the latest productivity figures, given they showed only slow growth in unit labour costs, said Alan Clarke, economist at Scotiabank. Unit labour costs were up 0.4% in the fourth quarter from the third quarter and were 1.3% higher compared with a year earlier. The Bank was already expected to keep interest rates at their record low of 0.5% for many months to come and these figures would make little difference, said Clarke. \u201cThe Brexit vote has tied the BoE\u2019s hands for the time being. If an imminent rate hike was on a knife edge, this data release would have just pushed the hike into the long grass,\u201d he said. \u201cBut with a rate hike a distant prospect, this release merely confirms the market thinking.\u201d",

Ministers will be hoping that the end of year productivity slump was a blip but economists expressed concern about the figures, which on the surface suggested British workers had increased their hours but failed to increase their output at the same time.</p> <p>Howard Archer, economist at IHS Global Insight said the relapse in productivity was \u201cdisappointing and worrying news for UK economic prospects. The crucial question for the UK economy is does the fourth quarter of 2015 mark a temporary relapse in productivity. Or is it evidence that the UK has an ongoing serious productivity problem.\u201d</p> <p>The British Chambers of Commerce said weak productivity was hampering the UK\u2019s overall economic growth. \u201cThere are deep-rooted structural problems in our economy that have dampened productivity \u2013 from skills shortages, to infrastructure bottlenecks and limited growth finance,\u201d said Suren Thiru, head of economics at the group. \u201cDelivering solutions to these critical issues would go a long way to achieving the productivity gains we need.\u201d</p> <p>But the Institute of Directors (IoD) warned against reading too much into the latest figures. \u201cThe key thing is not too get too worried about one statistic; there is no point in comparing ourselves to the pre-crisis productivity trend, which was a feature of a bubble about to pop,\u201d said its chief economist, James Sproule.</p> <p>The figures follow a gloomier outlook for the UK economy from the government\u2019s independent forecasters, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR). That downgrade, published alongside the chancellor George Osborne\u2019s March budget, was largely driven by what the OBR\u2019s experts saw as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/mar/16/budget-2016-george-osborne-sugar-tax-growth-forecast-falls\">bleaker prospects for productivity growth</a>.<br></p> <p>The government has vowed to address the UK\u2019s woeful productivity performance, which has left the gap with other leading western economies at the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/18/uk-productivity-gap-widens-to-worst-level-since-records-began\">biggest since modern records began in the early 1990s</a>. Output per hour worked in the UK was 18 percentage points below the average for the remaining six members of the G7 group of industrial nations in 2014, the Office for National Statistics reported in February.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"68450e2eb1b694cb9ada25306c0ef32d0fe88767\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/68450e2eb1b694cb9ada25306c0ef32d0fe88767/0_0_2139_1283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The business secretary, Sajid Javid\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The business secretary, Sajid Javid, who says boosting productivity is the economic challenge of our age.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Pruchnie/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The business secretary, Sajid Javid, said last year that <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/fixing-the-foundations-boosting-britains-productivity\">\u201cboosting productivity is the economic challenge of our age\u201d</a> and the government launched a productivity plan in July 2015. But that plan was recently <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/01/uks-productivity-plan-is-vague-collection-of-existing-policies\">criticised by an influential committee of MPs for lacking clear goals and original ideas</a> on how the UK can catch up with other advanced economies.</p> <p>The Commons business, innovation and skills committee questioned whether the plan was worthy of its name and urged the government to be bolder.<br></p> <p>Britain\u2019s failure to boost productivity since the downturn, known as the productivity puzzle, has also been a focus for the Bank of England as it seeks to work out how much businesses can raise output without piling up inflationary pressures.</p> <p>But policymakers were unlikely to be worried about inflation based on the the latest productivity figures, given they showed only slow growth in unit labour costs, said Alan Clarke, economist at Scotiabank. </p> <p>Unit labour costs were up 0.4% in the fourth quarter from the third quarter and were 1.3% higher compared with a year earlier. The Bank was already expected to keep interest rates at their record low of 0.5% for many months to come and these figures would make little difference, said Clarke.</p> <p>\u201cThe Brexit vote has tied the BoE\u2019s hands for the time being. If an imminent rate hike was on a knife edge, this data release would have just pushed the hike into the long grass,\u201d he said. \u201cBut with a rate hike a distant prospect, this release merely confirms the market thinking.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "A fight between shareholders over free sausages at Daimler\u2019s annual meeting has overshadowed the German luxury carmaker\u2019s declaration of its highest dividend ever. The dispute at Daimler\u2019s meeting in Berlin on Wednesday quickly turned ugly, forcing the company to call the police. The row broke out when one man repeatedly went to the buffet and began wrapping up several sausages to take home, whereupon a female shareholder intervened to tick him off, resulting in a shouting match and the police being called. Answering shareholder questions at the meeting, Daimler board chairman Manfred Bischoff said: \u201cWe had to call the police to settle the matter.\u201d A Daimler spokeswoman said it was a verbal altercation and the police were called to calm matters \u2013 because the female shareholder wanted to file a complaint for slander, and did so. At the centre of the row were Saitenw\u00fcrschtle, Bischoff said with a wink \u2013 long, thin sausages from Swabia in Daimler\u2019s home state of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg in south-west Germany. Elsewhere they are known as Wiener W\u00fcrstchen or frankfurter. The company served about 12,500 sausages to the 5,500 shareholders at the meeting for lunch, alongside bread rolls, wraps, potato soup and potato salad, followed by cake in the afternoon. The buffet was near the area where the carmaker showcased its latest models. Bischoff concluded: \u201cWe either need more sausages or we get rid of them altogether.\u201d Daimler shareholders approved a dividend of \u20ac3.25 a share, the highest in the company\u2019s history \u2013 enough in itself to buy a double-pack of sausages at German discounter Aldi. Swabians are well-known for their thriftiness in Germany. Buffet lunches are part of the culture of German shareholder meetings, which tend to be lengthy affairs. Some events last all day and run well into the evening, because each shareholder has the right to speak and ask detailed questions. The Daimler annual meeting lasted from 10am until 4.15pm local time, the shortest AGM the spokeswoman could recall \u2013 despite the dispute. German singer-songwriter Reinhard Mey immortalised Die hei\u00dfe Schlacht am kalten Buffet (The hot battle at the cold buffet) in a 1970s song, which featured a high society lady filling up her handbag with buffet leftovers. UK companies also used to serve up lavish buffet lunches but have cut back in recent years, although many still serve sandwiches or tea, coffee and biscuits. Marks &amp; Spencer, which delighted shareholders with free ice-cream and wine at the 2010 AGM, prompted shareholder wrath when it ditched the traditional lunch two years later, offering instead a goody bag worth \u00a36.59. Traditionally, many firms have handed out goody bags comprising a selection of their products alongside the buffet lunch \u2013 tobacco companies used to give away cigarettes in the past.",

The rise in the FTSE 100 - up 31.19 points to 6192.82 - has come despite a number of companies going ex-dividend. These include Pearson, which is down 46p at 822p and is the biggest faller in the leading index. Analysts however believe the ex-dividend is not the only reason for the fall. Ian Whittaker of Liberum issued a sell note, saying: Pearson is off sharply today, in part because it has gone ex-div (34p final dividend) but also presumably because of a negative read-across from US for-profit higher education provider Apollo Education Group, which reported second quarter results last night and withdrew its full year guidance after admitting that numbers would be below expectations driven by lower than expected student numbers... Our biggest area of concern with Pearson is its US higher education business, which we estimate is at least a third of group profits: with for-profits structurally impacted and community college enrolments also down, enrolment issues are compounding Pearson\u2019s structural problems with textbooks. Others going ex-div include Aviva, down 11.4p to 430.6p, Lloyds Banking Group, 1.49p lower at 66.09p and Taylor Wimpey, off 3.4p at 190.3p. Also falling is Worldpay, down 7.5p at 275.3p after major shareholders Advent International and Bain Capital sold 275m shares via a placing at 2690p to raise around \u00a3740m. With hopes of a deal to freeze oil output at this month\u2019s meeting of producers, Brent crude has added another 0.3% to $39.97 a barrel. Upbeat news from China\u2019s economy has supported miners, with Anglo American up 15.9p at 538.4p and BHP Billiton, 20.9p better at 753.6p, helped by JP Morgan raising its target price from 600p to 665p. AstraZeneca has added 75p to 4202.5p in the wake of the collapse of Pfizer\u2019s $160bn deal to buy Allergan, as investors tried to decide where Pfizer may pounce next. As for the Fed, the minutes of its last meeting suggested a June rise could be on the cards, according to Caxton FX analyst Alexandra Russell-Oliver: The Fed debated an April rate hike\u2014some see a case for it, some think that would send a signal of urgency that isn\u2019t \u201cappropriate\u201d. Subsequently, the Fed continues to expect to raise rates at a gradual pace, and is proceeding with caution. So while am April rate hike remains unlikely, a June hike is still on the table, provided upcoming data continues to support the argument for raising rates.",

      "bodyText": "Sainsbury\u2019s is ditching its Brand Match promotion later this month as it prepares to cut more prices on everyday products. The supermarket is understood to be planning to end the scheme, which it introduced in 2011, because changing shopping habits mean it now applies to less than a fifth of transactions. It is switching investment to cutting prices on basics such as bread, cheese and household cleaning products rather than the Brand Match scheme, which gives shoppers money-off vouchers if they could have bought branded goods cheaper at Asda. The change comes as shoppers move towards buying little and often, rather than one big weekly shop, so fewer baskets contain the 10 items, including at least one branded product, needed to qualify for Brand Match. This is the latest step in a change of strategy for Sainsbury\u2019s towards investing in lower everyday prices rather than complex promotional deals. The supermarket promised to invest \u00a3150m in November 2014 as part of chief executive Mike Coupe\u2019s recovery plan for the business. Earlier this year, the retailer, which is currently the best performer of the UK\u2019s big four supermarket chains, said it would phase out the vast majority of multi-buy deals by August in favour of simpler lower prices. Supermarket pricing tactics have been under scrutiny by the government\u2019s competition watchdog in response to a \u201csuper-complaint\u201d lodged by the consumer group Which? last April. It submitted a dossier setting out details of \u201cdodgy multi-buys, shrinking products and baffling sales offers\u201d, claiming retailers were creating the illusion of savings, with 40% of groceries sold on promotion. But Sainsbury\u2019s also drew criticism when it stopped handing out vouchers if customers could buy branded goods cheaper at Tesco in 2014. The chain\u2019s motives are likely to be questioned by shoppers who benefit from money back on branded items. Several supermarkets have been reviewing their price-matching schemes as the market is gripped by a price war. The big chains are trying to fight off growing competition from discounters Aldi and Lidl. Morrisons removed the price-matching element of its loyalty card scheme, Match &amp; More, in October \u2013 little more than a year after it was launched. Asda is reviewing its Price Guarantee scheme, which promises to refund the difference if the supermarket is not 10% cheaper than its rivals. The move to stop handing out vouchers if branded goods are cheaper in Asda may raise fears that Sainsbury\u2019s is losing its competitive edge. It is understood that 16% of customer transactions are covered under Brand Match, with the majority of comparable shops being the same as or cheaper than Asda.",

      "bodyText": "Marks &amp; Spencer\u2019s new chief executive is reviewing the future of its range of fashion brands including Classic and Per Una as part of an overhaul of its struggling clothing business. Clothing sales have grown in only one quarter over the past five years and, in his first presentation to the City as chief executive, Steve Rowe said its performance was \u201cunsatisfactory\u201d and improving it was his \u201cnumber one priority\u201d. \u201cOur priority is fixing clothing,\u201d said Rowe, who reiterated that he would continue to lead the division himself rather than hand responsibility to another executive. \u201cThe [clothing] team has sat down and given itself a number of exam questions,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve not been as stylish as we need to be, not had the availability and need to make sure we have the right product at the right price.\u201d In the first glimpse of his turnaround plan for the retailer\u2019s clothing arm, Rowe, who took over from Marc Bolland on Saturday, revealed it had begun a review of its main fashion labels which also include Blue Harbour, North Coast, Indigo, Limited and Autograph. Fashion experts think it is not clear who some of the brands are aimed at and they are not distinct enough. Rowe also acknowledged that some of its clothing had become too expensive, cutting the price of 300 women and men\u2019s spring lines by 10-15%. It sold 30,000 pairs of black jeggings - a 200% increase - after cutting the price by \u00a32 to \u00a317.50, while it had shifted 41,000 men\u2019s white T-shirts after reducing the price from \u00a37.50 to \u00a36. It has also cut the price of the top five sellers in its main spring womenswear collection to \u00a335, compared with \u00a340 a year ago, Rowe said. Like-for-like clothing and home sales were down by 2.7% in the 13 weeks to 26 March, although this was better than the decline of more than 3% expected by analysts. On the food side, although sales were flat M&amp;S said the division outperformed rivals and expanded its market share to 4.3%, after opening 80 stores and launching 400 new products. M&amp;S also ran 40% fewer clothing promotions in stores and online during the quarter, helping to boost profit margins which will now be at the top end of City expectations. Rowe, who has worked for the retailer for 26 years, said it was working on improving its ranges and becoming more fashionable. He said sales in its Autograph collection were up 10% as shoppers embraced styles fashioned by its former head of design Queralt Ferrer. Last year he promoted Ferrer, formerly of Zara owner Inditex, to a far bigger role, becoming the retailer\u2019s first director of design for womenswear, lingerie and beauty. Shore Capital analyst Clive Black said Rowe had acquitted himself well during his first grilling by City analysts. \u201cHe\u2019s a good guy who successfully traversed the crevasse of showing pride in running business alongside a hunger for improvement.\u201d Black said M&amp;S\u2019s clothing business had suffered \u201csustained brand corrosion\u201d and turning it around would not be an easy or quick process. \u201cThe solutions revolve around product, merchandising, marketing and price to the extent that M&amp;S can engineer positive change that delivers sustainable same-store and then trading profit growth,\u201d he said. \u201cWe struggle to see this process of change involving a mere Elastoplast.\u201d Some analysts think Rowe will lower short term profit expectations when he presents its full year results on 25 May, offering the carrot of growth further down the line. Others say he may streamline M&amp;S\u2019s board structure to hasten decision making and reduce the firm\u2019s bloated estate of nearly 900 UK stores. Shares in M&amp;S have fallen by a quarter over the last year and last month hit an 18-month low after Next boss Lord Wolfson warned this year could see the toughest for fashion retailers since the 2008 financial crisis. However the shares closed up 3% at 433p as the City showed it was prepared to give Rowe time to make an impact.",

      "bodyText": "Marks &amp; Spencer\u2019s new boss, Steve Rowe, faces the City for the first time on Thursday, just days after starting the job with a tour of the Croydon store where he first began working for M&amp;S as a 15-year-old Saturday boy. Pacing the aisles in the shop where he once packed knitwear, and his grandmother worked in the lingerie department, would have given him a good perspective on M&amp;S\u2019s problems. Just like the wider business, the Croydon store faces an uncertain future as it fights for space within the planned redevelopment of the 1960s Whitgift shopping centre by Westfield and Hammerson. On a mild spring midweek day when the Guardian visits, the store looks a bit shabby round the edges with a broken security barrier and tatty toilets that do not appear to have been refurbished since the centre opened. But the cafe is packed with mostly middle-aged women, mothers and some elderly men enjoying lunch or a coffee and a gossip. It is busy in footwear, food and beauty but the most crowded section of the store is by the sale rails where friends attempt to hunt out a bargain together. The broad church of M&amp;S\u2019s potential customer base is most evident by the menswear sale rail where a baseball capped youth is checking out trousers beside a suited office worker and an elderly chap in a Barbour-style jacket and slacks. Rowe told staff he was committed to having stores in Croydon, which he said had a \u201cbright future\u201d. Shoppers in Croydon seem less sure about M&amp;S\u2019s place on their high street. \u201cI don\u2019t buy things in M&amp;S,\u201d says Marvia, a fashionable 45-year-old passing by the store with her son. \u201cMaybe the prices need to come down. I want to see something trendier. At my age, I\u2019m looking at classics but I want to mix and match and I don\u2019t feel like I want to dress in a certain way yet. They should look at what Zara is doing. That\u2019s my shop.\u201d Nicole, 41, says she will pop into M&amp;S for underwear, trousers or boots but \u201cthey need to be more modern to attract younger people\u201d. Rowe would do well to listen to these women in their 40s who used to be M&amp;S\u2019s core customer base. Now the average shopper is well over 50 and the retailer has recorded only one quarterly increase in clothing sales in the past five years. On Thursday, M&amp;S revealed another slide in sales in the three months to end March. Clothing and homewares like-for-like sales were down by 2.7%, although this was better than the 3% fall that had been expected by analysts. In Croydon, even older shoppers who remain loyal say their daughters no longer accompany them into M&amp;S because the styling is not up to scratch. \u201cThe style and the price are OK for me although it is more expensive than other places like Debenhams,\u201d says Catherine Taylor, a smart and stylishly dressed 72-year-old. \u201cBut for the young that come in, there isn\u2019t anything trendy.\u201d Sharon and Janice, 57 and 80, say they are big fans of M&amp;S and admit they are dressed nearly head to toe in the chain\u2019s clothing. \u201cI love the food,\u201d says Sharon, \u201cand the quality of the clothing is good.\u201d But Janice says too many of the dresses and skirts are too short for her and she can no longer find the simple well-made trousers and skirts that she used to buy regularly for work. \u201cIn a nutshell, they have stopped selling the classic styles which everyone used to come to M&amp;S for,\u201d she says. Whether it\u2019s classics or fashion, M&amp;S\u2019s place on the high street in Croydon and beyond will depend on Rowe finding a way to ensure 40- to 50-year-olds feel as comfortable in its clothing as they did when he was first working on the shop floor 30 years ago.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "In his statement announcing the decision to keep interest rates steady, the governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, Glenn Stevens, took the position that when it comes to currency battles it is better to jaw-jaw than war-war. Right now it is a bit tough to gauge the \u201ccorrect\u201d value of a country\u2019s currency. The major trading powers in the world \u2013 the US, Europe, Japan and China \u2013 are all indulging in some form of aggressive monetary policy which affects the value of their currencies. Whether it be quantitative easing, negative interest rates, or the depreciation of the yuan, countries are competing against each other in a currency war to try to keep the value of theirs down in order to assist with exports. Thus far the RBA has chosen not to follow such a path \u2013 partly because unlike the US and Europe our economy didn\u2019t go into the toilet in the great recession, and also because the falling prices of iron ore, coal and oil were doing the job for it. The value of our dollar is linked to the prices of our major exports and thus a massive drop in their prices since 2012 has seen similar large falls in the Aussie. So did Stevens\u2019 words have any impact? Well the dollar did fall about half a per cent on Wednesday, though as ever in the international currency market many factors were in play \u2013 including the Japan-US currency battles. But then \u2013 because with currency markets nothing ever goes to plan \u2013 on Thursday morning it made a small rebound. But in the past few months there has been a slight improvement in the value of our major export commodities and the dollar has risen from a low of US$0.687 in January to US$0.766 last Thursday: Now we do need to keep a bit of context \u2013 after all the value remains well down on where it was throughout most of 2015. But after a nine-month run of being below US$0.75, the dollar looked set on a path to US$0.80: The clearest way the RBA could prevent this is by cutting interest rates. A lower interest rate means a lower return on money held in Australian banks in Australian dollars, thus international investors move money into another currency where they can get better returns. This reduces the demand for our dollar, and also reduces its price (in terms of other currencies such as the US dollar). But cutting the exchange rate has implications for our economy \u2013 implications that can outweigh the concerns of a high dollar. For example, the housing market has shown distinct signs of cooling off in Sydney and Melbourne. The RBA\u2019s statement on Tuesday noted: \u201cThe pace of growth in dwelling prices has moderated in Melbourne and Sydney and has remained mostly subdued in other cities.\u201d The bank would be happy with this \u2013 growth in housing prices is good, but not if it is so strong that it may lead to a bubble. And that\u2019s the problem with cutting rates to help lower the value of our dollar \u2013 it could start up the housing boom again. And so instead of cutting the RBA used words. Generally the statement issued each month by the governor of the RBA announcing the latest interest rate decision changes very little \u2013 and people like me perhaps spend far too much time pondering the differences in words. For example on the issue of inflation, in March the governor said: \u201cInflation is quite low. With growth in labour costs continuing to be quite subdued as well, and inflation restrained elsewhere in the world, inflation is likely to remain low over the next year or two.\u201d This month he said: \u201cInflation is quite low. Recent information has confirmed that growth in labour costs remains quite subdued. Given this, and with inflation also restrained elsewhere in the world, inflation in Australia is likely to remain low over the next year or two.\u201d A few changes, but there\u2019s not a lot of difference in meaning between \u201ccontinuing to be quite subdued\u201d and \u201cremains quite subdued\u201d. But this month there was a big difference in the language relating to the exchange rate. Last month there was merely a by-the-by aside that \u201cthe exchange rate has been adjusting to the evolving economic outlook\u201d. This month a new paragraph was inserted noting: \u201cThe Australian dollar has appreciated somewhat recently. In part, this reflects some increase in commodity prices, but monetary developments elsewhere in the world have also played a role. Under present circumstances, an appreciating exchange rate could complicate the adjustment under way in the economy.\u201d \u201cComplicate the adjustment\u201d is a pretty unsubtle way of Stevens alerting the world\u2019s currency traders that he won\u2019t stand by while the dollar continues to rise \u2013 especially if due to \u201cdevelopments elsewhere in the world\u201d (ie other central banks working to lower the value of their own currency). Australia\u2019s rebalancing economy currently needs a lower dollar \u2013 especially in light of the trade figures also out yesterday which showed a near record deficit: That deficit is in current dollars and thus it is not our lowest in terms of GDP, but it is still nothing to be too happy about \u2013 especially as it occurred due to exports falling by more than imports have: Surprisingly, the exports falls \u2013 at least in seasonally adjusted terms \u2013 were not from the mining sector, but the rural one. In trend terms however both sectors fell. The one bright spot has been the services sector \u2013 ie mostly tourism and education \u2013 the sectors most affected by a rising dollar: So did Stevens\u2019 words have any impact? Well, the dollar did fall about half a per cent on Wednesday, though as ever with the international currency market many factors were in play \u2013 including the Japan-US currency battles. But the dollar is now 1.3% below where it was on Thursday. The market has also priced in a greater chance of a rate cut by the end of the year than was previously expected: That doesn\u2019t mean there will be a rate cut \u2013 the market in January thought the chances of a rate cut this month were about 50:50. But it reflects a view that the RBA is now seen as more likely to cut, and that in itself may help dampen demand for our dollar and keep it from rising to US$0.80. If it doesn\u2019t, Stevens will have to move from talking about cutting rates to actually doing it. In the currency wars, all talk no action rarely wins the day.",

But then \u2013 because with currency markets nothing ever goes to plan \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com.au/the-australian-dollar-has-staged-a-comeback-2016-4\">on Thursday morning</a> it made a small rebound.</p> <p> But in the past few months there has been a slight improvement in the value of our major export commodities and the dollar has risen from a low of US$0.687 in January to US$0.766 last Thursday:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Graph 2\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/dtfD6/2/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Now we do need to keep a bit of context \u2013 after all the value remains well down on where it was throughout most of 2015. But after a nine-month run of being below US$0.75, the dollar looked set on a path to US$0.80:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Graph 3\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/tAcGD/2/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The clearest way the RBA could prevent this is by cutting interest rates. A lower interest rate means a lower return on money held in Australian banks in Australian dollars, thus international investors move money into another currency where they can get better returns.</p> <p>This reduces the demand for our dollar, and also reduces its price (in terms of other currencies such as the US dollar). But cutting the exchange rate has implications for our economy \u2013 implications that can outweigh the concerns of a high dollar.</p> <p>For example, the housing market has shown distinct signs of cooling off in Sydney and Melbourne.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/06/federal-reserve-interest-rate-delay-split-decision-janet-yellen\">Federal reserve was split over decision to delay interest rate hike</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The RBA\u2019s statement on Tuesday noted: \u201cThe pace of growth in dwelling prices has moderated in Melbourne and Sydney and has remained mostly subdued in other cities.\u201d</p> <p>The bank would be happy with this \u2013 growth in housing prices is good, but not if it is so strong that it may lead to a bubble. And that\u2019s the problem with cutting rates to help lower the value of our dollar \u2013 it could start up the housing boom again.</p> <p>And so instead of cutting the RBA used words. </p> <p>Generally the statement issued each month by the governor of the RBA announcing the latest interest rate decision changes very little \u2013 and people like me perhaps spend far too much time pondering the differences in words.</p> <p>For example on the issue of inflation, in March the governor said: \u201cInflation is quite low. With growth in labour costs continuing to be quite subdued as well, and inflation restrained elsewhere in the world, inflation is likely to remain low over the next year or two.\u201d</p> <p>This month he said: \u201cInflation is quite low. Recent information has confirmed that growth in labour costs remains quite subdued. Given this, and with inflation also restrained elsewhere in the world, inflation in Australia is likely to remain low over the next year or two.\u201d</p> <p>A few changes, but there\u2019s not a lot of difference in meaning between \u201ccontinuing to be quite subdued\u201d and \u201cremains quite subdued\u201d.</p> <p>But this month there was a big difference in the language relating to the exchange rate. </p> <p>Last month there was merely a by-the-by aside that \u201cthe exchange rate has been adjusting to the evolving economic outlook\u201d.</p> <p>This month a new paragraph was inserted noting: \u201cThe Australian dollar has appreciated somewhat recently. In part, this reflects some increase in commodity prices, but monetary developments elsewhere in the world have also played a role. Under present circumstances, an appreciating exchange rate could complicate the adjustment under way in the economy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cComplicate the adjustment\u201d is a pretty unsubtle way of Stevens alerting the world\u2019s currency traders that he won\u2019t stand by while the dollar continues to rise \u2013 especially if due to \u201cdevelopments elsewhere in the world\u201d (ie other central banks working to lower the value of their own currency).</p> <p>Australia\u2019s rebalancing economy currently needs a lower dollar \u2013 especially in light of the trade figures also out yesterday which showed a near record deficit:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Graph 4\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Nwloe/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>That deficit is in current dollars and thus it is not our lowest in terms of GDP, but it is still nothing to be too happy about \u2013 especially as it occurred due to exports falling by more than imports have:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Graph 5\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/lNwcF/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Surprisingly, the exports falls \u2013 at least in seasonally adjusted terms \u2013 were not from the mining sector, but the rural one.</p> <p>In trend terms however both sectors fell. The one bright spot has been the services sector \u2013 ie mostly tourism and education \u2013 the sectors most affected by a rising dollar:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Graph 6\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/b9ynz/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>So did Stevens\u2019 words have any impact? Well, the dollar did fall about half a per cent on Wednesday, though as ever with the international currency market many factors were in play \u2013 including the Japan-US currency battles. But the dollar is now 1.3% below where it was on Thursday.</p> <p>The market has also priced in a greater chance of a rate cut by the end of the year than was previously expected:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Graph 7\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/AmEYz/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>That doesn\u2019t mean there will be a rate cut \u2013 the market in January thought the chances of a rate cut this month were about 50:50. But it reflects a view that the RBA is now seen as more likely to cut, and that in itself may help dampen demand for our dollar and keep it from rising to US$0.80.</p> <p>If it doesn\u2019t, Stevens will have to move from talking about cutting rates to actually doing it. In the currency wars, all talk no action rarely wins the day.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The mining and resources giant Adani is being investigated for alleged involvement in a US$4.4bn pricing scandal around coal sales by Indian power companies. Adani Enterprises is one of six Adani Group companies named for the first time in connection with an industry-wide scandal in which Indian energy companies are accused of profiteering on coal imported from Indonesia. The company denies being involved over-valuing the coal. It comes days after Adani Enterprises\u2019 Australian subsidiary, Adani Mining, was granted mining leases by the Queensland government for the country\u2019s largest proposed coal project in the Galilee basin. The Adani Group companies are among dozens of companies targeted in an 18-month investigation by the Indian Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI), the Economic and Political Weekly revealed. DRI last week issued a \u201cgeneral alert\u201d to customs offices claiming that power companies were exploiting \u201chigher tariff compensation based on [the] artificially inflated cost of the imported coal\u201d from Indonesia, it reported. Profits from the alleged scam by companies supplying state-owned power utilities were being \u201csiphoned\u201d overseas, the DRI alert said. An Adani Group spokesman told Guardian Australia it was \u201caware of the investigations being conducted by the DRI, and has fully co-operated, and shall continue to co-operate with the investigating agencies\u201d. \u201cAdani Group denies the allegations of over valuation and there is no show cause notice received till date,\u201d he said. The DRI, an agency attached to the Indian finance ministry, made its first arrest as part of the investigation in February, in a case unrelated to the Adani Group. In court documents following the arrest, the DRI alleged a number of Indian power plants were inflating the prices of their Indonesian coal imports, passing on the costs to customers and hiding the profits overseas, the Economic and Political Weekly reported. The power companies typically used front companies in Singapore, Hong Kong and Dubai to inflate the prices of coal in official billing documents, the DRI alleged. Indian energy minister Piyush Goyal told Economic and Political Weekly that the DRI was \u201cinvestigating cases related to misdeclaration of value (over invoicing) of coal imported from Indonesia and supplied to power plants of NTPC [the former National Thermal Power Corporation, India\u2019s biggest power producer]\u201d. The publication named Adani Group companies Adani Enterprises, Adani Power, Adani Power Rajasthan, Adani Power Maharashtra, Adani Wilmar and Vyom Trade Link as targets of the investigation. The Adani Group spokesman said all its coal imports had \u201ctaken place at contemporaneous prices prevailing in the international market which all along [have] been accepted by customs authorities across all ports in India. \u201cAdani Group is supplying to different utilities including public sector utilities in the power sector through a transparent bidding process,\u201d he said. \u201cThe tariff in most cases is also discovered through bidding system and other cases determined by the regulatories in accordance with law.\u201d Adani Mining has indicated about half the coal from its Queensland mine, which will produce up to 60 million tonnes a year, would supply the Indian market, including Adani\u2019s own generators.",
