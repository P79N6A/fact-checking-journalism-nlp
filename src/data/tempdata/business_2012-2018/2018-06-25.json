      "bodyText": "The pound\u2019s strengthening against the dollar has increased the cost of living in London, Birmingham and Aberdeen, which have moved up the ranks of the world\u2019s most expensive cities. Hong Kong is the world\u2019s most expensive city for expatriates, followed by Tokyo, Zurich, Singapore and Seoul, according to a cost of living survey, which ranks 209 cities on the cost of a basket of more than 200 goods and services such as coffee, bread, milk, cinema and rent. There are no UK cities in the top 10, but London made it back into the top 20, rising 10 places to 19th. Birmingham moved up 19 spots to 128th, Aberdeen 12 places to 134th and Belfast jumped eighteen spots to 152th. Kate Fitzpatrick, the UK head at Mercer, the consultancy behind the survey, said: \u201cUK cities\u2019 rise in this year\u2019s ranking is mainly due to a strengthening of the pound against the US dollar.\u201d After falling in the wake of the Brexit referendum, the pound had risen by around 14% against the dollar between March 2017 and March 2018, when the survey was conducted. Fitzpatrick added that a drop in London rent costs held back London\u2019s rise up the rankings. Hong Kong has regained the top spot in the ranking from Luanda, now in sixth place due in part to a decline in the Angolan capital\u2019s housing market, which has lowered rental costs. Hong Kong also came top in 2016. Expats pay the highest rent in Hong Kong \u2013 \u00a35,486 per month for a two-bedroom unfurnished apartment \u201cof international standards in an appropriate neighbourhood,\u201d and \u00a39,600 for a three-bedroom house. This compares with \u00a33,100 a month in London for a two-bed flat and \u00a35,000 for a three-bed house; while in New York it costs \u00a34,076 to rent a flat and \u00a36,793 to rent a house; in Luanda, which has a limited supply of the type of housing favoured by expats, rent is \u00a33,647 for a flat and \u00a37,866 for a house. German cities experienced some of the biggest moves in the ranking, due to rising rents and the strengthening of the euro against the dollar. Frankfurt (68th) and Berlin (71th) both jumped 49 spots while Munich (57th) climbed 41 places. Mercer\u2019s 2018 cost of living ranking shows that a cup of coffee, including service, costs \u00a35.54 in Hong Kong, \u00a34.52 in Zurich, \u00a32.80 in London, \u00a32.52 in Tokyo and \u00a31.75 in New York. A pair of blue jeans costs, on average, \u00a3104.34 in Buenos Aires, \u00a3102.76 in Johannesburg, \u00a3107.09 in Dubai and \u00a385 in London, but only \u00a341.48 in New York. A cinema ticket for an international movie is more expensive in London than any other city, costing \u00a316.79. This compared with \u00a311.92 in Tokyo, \u00a312.39 in Sydney, \u00a312.15 in New York, \u00a310.52 in Hong Kong and \u00a314.55 in Zurich. In the survey New York was used as the base city for all comparisons, and currency movements were measured against the US dollar.",

      "bodyText": "Struggling city centres should end their dependency on retail by replacing shops with offices and housing, according to a report. The Centre for Cities thinktank said the increasing tendency for consumer spending to shift online was a particular risk for city centres in England and Wales that are overreliant on the consumer. The retail industry has been hit by a number of high-profile failures and waves of shop closures as the high street has sought to cope with the challenge posed by internet shopping amid a squeeze on living standards. The report said in successful city centres offices made up two-thirds of the commercial space and the quality of the office space was higher than in other cities. In Bristol and Manchester, which have thriving city centres, retail made up 18% of commercial space. The Centre for Cities said retail outlets were helped by having large numbers of office workers to sell to. By contrast, in poorly performing city centres, offices accounted for less than a quarter of commercial space and the quality of that space was inferior to that of more successful economies. In Blackpool and Newport, more than 40% of commercial space was in retail, much of it struggling. The lack of office space meant fewer potential customers, leading to average vacancy rates of 16% \u2013 almost double the 9% in thriving cities. The report said this made the weaker cities more vulnerable to the continued shift to online shopping. The report also found that the high number of empty shops in struggling city centres reflected broader economic challenges they faced. Of the five cities with the highest number of vacant retail lots in 2017-18, four \u2013 Newport, Blackpool, Bradford and Sheffield \u2013 had a loss of city centre jobs. City centres within the greater south-east \u2013 the most productive of those studied \u2013 had on average much lower vacancy rates than cities elsewhere in the country. The thinktank recommended that cities with relatively high numbers of shops should convert some of these units into residential and office use. Where demand for offices and homes was weak, some demolition could be needed to enable the land to be used to \u201cimprove the public realm\u201d. The Centre for Cities said the government also had a role to play in city centre regeneration and should consider intervening to supply small amounts of new office space to meet demand from high-productivity firms if the private sector was not building enough offices. It added that government should reform business rates \u2013 a tax based on a valuation of a company\u2019s property \u2013 to allow more frequent revaluations of premises. Andrew Carter, the chief executive of Centre for Cities, said: \u201cEach day seems to bring a new crisis for the high street but the answer is not to double down on the declining retail sector. Instead, we need to reimagine struggling city centres as places where lots of different businesses can locate and create jobs \u2013 and where lots of people want to go to for a variety of reasons. \u201cThis means reducing the reliance on shops and focusing on creating a more attractive environment for a wider range of firms. We also need to make our high streets more open and appealing spaces for people to spend time or live in, by improving public realm and transport links, and potentially introducing more housing.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Harley-Davidson plans to shift the production of some of its bikes out of the US in response to Europe\u2019s new tariffs on motorcycle imports. In a stock market filing, the company said the EU\u2019s reaction to Donald Trump\u2019s steel tariffs, which will add $2,200 (\u00a31,657) to the average cost of a motorcycle exported from the US to Europe, will result in up to $100m of extra charges over the next couple of years. The decision is the most high-profile example to date of the potential impact of a widening trade dispute between the US and its largest trading partners. It came amid reports of US plans to escalate its trade spat with China, reports that led to sharp selloffs in global stock markets on Monday. Trump said he was \u201csurprised\u201d that Harley-Davison \u201cwould be the first to wave the White Flag\u201d. \u201cI fought hard for them and ultimately they will not pay tariffs selling into the E.U., which has hurt us badly on trade, down $151 Billion. Taxes just a Harley excuse - be patient! #MAGA,\u201d he wrote on Twitter. \u201cHarley-Davidson maintains a strong commitment to US-based manufacturing, which is valued by riders globally,\u201d Harley-Davidson said in the filing. \u201cIncreasing international production to alleviate the EU tariff burden isn\u2019t the company\u2019s preference, but represents the only sustainable option to make its motorcycles accessible to customers in the EU and maintain a viable business in Europe.\u201d The company said ramping up production in international plants would require incremental investment and could take at least nine to 18 months to be fully complete. The decision is a blow to the Trump administration, which has defended its imposition of tariffs on the EU as part of a strategy to boost jobs in the US. Harley-Davidson is based in Wisconsin, a state Trump narrowly won in the last election and the home of the Republican House speaker, Paul Ryan. Earlier this year, the White House imposed a 25% tariff on steel and a 10% tariff on aluminium imports from several countries, including the 27-member EU. The US has also announced a range of tariffs on Chinese goods, and over the weekend the Wall Street Journal reported the US is considering barring some Chinese companies from investing in US technology firms and blocking additional technology exports to Beijing. European and US stock markets all fell on Monday on fears that the world was heading towards a fully fledged trade war. In London the FTSE 100 fell 2.24% or 172.43 points to 7509.84, its worst daily performance since 6 February this year. Germany\u2019s Dax, already weak on worries about the impact of tariffs on its key car producers, dropped 2.46%, while France\u2019s CAC closed nearly 2% down. In the US stock markets had their worst day in months, the Dow Jones Industrial Index and S&amp;P 500 were both down over 1% while the tech-heavy Nasdaq dipped over 2%. Retaliation by Brussels and Beijing has targeted producers in Republican states where Trump draws much of his support \u2013 including bourbon whiskey and Levi\u2019s jeans \u2013 and is expected to raise the prices of US goods worth up to \u20ac2.8bn (\u00a32.5bn). Trump has threatened to widen the mounting trade dispute by imposing tariffs on European cars. In a tweet last week he said: \u201cIf these Tariffs and Barriers are not soon broken down and removed, we will be placing a 20% Tariff on all of their cars coming into the U.S. Build them here!\u201d Harley-Davidson\u2019s decision is particularly awkward for Trump. Last year he used a White House visit from the company\u2019s executives to push his \u201cAmerica First\u201d trade policies. \u201cA lot of countries are taking advantage of us,\u201d Trump said during a press briefing. \u201cThank you Harley-Davidson for building things in America.\u201d It is not clear where Harley-Davidson will boost production but the impact on jobs in the US could be severe and comes while sales are slumping. In January the company closed a factory in Kansas City as it struggled to overcome a four-year slide in sales. About 16% of Harley\u2019s sales are to Europe. The company sold 40,000 bikes in Europe last year and the revenue generated from EU countries is second only to the US.",

Whatever your view on the expansion of Heathrow, it ought to be easy to agree that if a third runway is going to happen at a (current) official estimate of \u00a314.3bn, it should be 100% clear who is on the hook if costs explode. The government has danced around the question, with transport secretary Chris Grayling offering vague lines about how a third runway must be \u201caffordable\u201d and be built \u201cat a sensible cost\u201d without defining what he means in figures. The airports national policy statement \u2013 the key document in the process \u2013 was 91 pages of flimflam. It simply stated that the final proposal should be \u201ccost-efficient and sustainable\u201d and seek \u201cto minimise costs to airlines, passengers and freight owners\u201d, with the Civil Aviation Authority left to sort out the details. Good luck to the CAA but one suspects it will be no match for Heathrow\u2019s battalion of lobbyists. At a minimum, the government should oblige Heathrow\u2019s owners \u2013 led by the Spanish firm Ferrovial, with a 25% stake, and the Qatar Investment Authority, with 20% \u2013 to inject many billions of pounds in upfront equity capital into their company to ensure the scheme can withstand the inevitable delays and surprises. As things stand today, Heathrow\u2019s use of debt \u2013 \u00a313.5bn at the last count \u2013 is so extreme that even Carillion\u2019s bosses would have blushed at the leverage ratios. Unlike at Carillion, however, if a financial emergency were to materialise with the third runway, there isn\u2019t a credible option of letting the company fail. The airport is too important to the UK \u2013 and the owners know it. So, if costs explode and risk equity remains minimal, the CAA would be drawn into a negotiation. The owner would want higher landing charges from airlines to service its debts and the regulator would come under huge pressure not to thwart a project carrying so much political prestige. That negotiation, one can guess, would be one-sided. Therein lies the scepticism from the airlines. Craig Kreeger, the chief executive of Virgin Atlantic, called in February for Heathrow to be forced to give a \u201cpassenger cost guarantee\u201d, adding: \u201cThey have the most information on how likely the costs are to be deliverable \u2013 and they should bear the risks of their estimate being grossly, grossly off-target.\u201d The airlines are not disinterested players, of course, since a third runway would bring more competition for them \u2013 but it is surely reasonable to expect Heathrow\u2019s owners to prove, upfront and transparently, that they will have a big cushion of risk capital in place. Simply pleading, as Heathrow does, that its owners are wealthy international investors with reputations to protect is not the same thing. It is hard to escape the conclusion that delay, confusion and political in-fighting has served Heathrow\u2019s owners well. Parliament has been asked for approval even before the airport has decided whether part of the M25 should be sunk into a tunnel to make room for the new runway or whether the runway should be built on stilts. That little detail may turn out to be important. Politicians seem so exhausted by the effort of getting the project across the line that detailed risk allocation has been left for later. One day, one suspects, the report from the National Audit Office will be a riveting read. Where is the Brexit voice from UK employers? First it was Airbus, then Siemens, now BMW. It would be useful if some large British-owned employers, if they feel similarly, spoke up about the potential damage to their supply chains from Brexit. A single clear statement from a large company is worth a hundred press releases from the CBI or any other trade body. Patriotism of self-preservation was understandable six months ago but now is not the time for UK employers to plead politeness. Find your voice.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A treatment for childhood epilepsy developed by a UK firm has been approved by US regulators and will become the first cannabis-based medicine on the American market. Epidiolex, made by GW Pharmaceuticals, is set to be launched in the autumn after being approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of two rare and severe forms of epilepsy, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) and Dravet syndrome, for patients from the age of two. The syndromes have a higher early mortality rate than other types of epilepsy and do not respond to many of the other drugs available. Epidiolex, an oral solution with a strawberry flavour that is taken twice a day, is the first medicine approved in the US for Dravet syndrome. It should be available to prescribe by doctors in Britain and the rest of Europe by mid-2019 if the European Medicines Agency approves it early next year. The FDA commissioner, Scott Gottlieb, said: \u201cThis approval serves as a reminder that advancing sound development programmes that properly evaluate active ingredients contained in marijuana can lead to important medical therapies. And the FDA is committed to this kind of careful scientific research and drug development.\u201d Philip Gattone, president and chief executive of the US-based Epilepsy Foundation, said: \u201cFor those living with intractable seizures caused by LGS and Dravet syndrome, Epidiolex represents a true medical advancement.\u201d The most common side effects in the clinical trials were sleepiness, elevated liver enzymes that can cause liver injury (generally mild), diarrhoea, insomnia and infections. Among other epilepsy drugs, the most serious risks include suicidal thoughts and attempts. The UK home secretary has just launched a review into medicinal uses of cannabis following public pressure from the families of two sick children: 12-year-old Billy Caldwell and six-year-old Alfie Dingley, who have forms of intractable epilepsy that appear to be eased by the use of cannabis oil. GW\u2019s chief executive, Justin Gover, stressed that Epidiolex was a prescription drug that had been shown to be effective in reducing seizures in clinical trials. \u201cCannabis oils are a very different thing. There\u2019s no regulation, no quality control and no information on dose and side effects.\u201d Gover said if GW was approached by the two boys\u2019 physicians to request Epidiolex, the firm would be able to assist. Epidiolex is a purified form of cannabidiol (CBD), one of the hundreds of molecules found in the marijuana plant. It contains less than 0.1% of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which makes people high. Epidiolex was developed by GW, which is based in London and Cambridge and employs 500 people in the UK, but is listed on the US stock exchange Nasdaq. It was founded in 1998 by the scientist Geoffrey Guy, who is now chairman, and a fellow biotech entrepreneur, Brian Whittle. The firm has had a Home Office licence to grow cannabis for the past two decades, initially at secret farms in southern England and since 2016 at British Sugar\u2019s 18-hectare glasshouse in Norfolk, and two other glasshouses. The cannabis is moved to a secret location in the UK where CBD is extracted and purified, and made into a medicine. More than 50 children in the UK have already been treated with Epidiolex free of charge out of 1,500 worldwide, mostly in the US, on a compassionate access programme. Gover would not reveal the likely price tag. Analysts expect the drug to become GW\u2019s first \u201cblockbuster\u201d medicine with annual sales of more than $1bn (\u00a3756m). Around 30,000 people in the US suffer from LGS and 6,000 from Dravet syndrome, with similar numbers across Europe. Gover said GW had enough capacity to provide treatment for all of them. GW initially developed Sativex, a mouth spray for multiple sclerosis-related spasticity, which became the first cannabis-based medicine to be licensed in Britain. The company then started scientific work on CBD as a treatment to reduce seizures. In December 2012, GW was approached by the family of Sam Vogelstein, then 11, who was suffering from severe epilepsy. The boy was given purified CBD, which later became Epidiolex, and he has been seizure-free for more than two years. He testified to the FDA advisory panel. GW is studying cannabinoid-based drugs as a treatment for other diseases.",

Epidiolex, an oral solution with a strawberry flavour that is taken twice a day, is the first medicine approved in the US for Dravet syndrome.<br></p> <p>It should be available to prescribe by doctors in Britain and the rest of Europe by mid-2019 if the European Medicines Agency approves it early next year.</p> <p>The FDA commissioner, Scott Gottlieb, said: \u201cThis approval serves as a reminder that advancing sound development programmes that properly evaluate active ingredients contained in marijuana can lead to important medical therapies. And the FDA is committed to this kind of careful scientific research and drug development.\u201d <br></p> <p>Philip Gattone, president and chief executive of the US-based Epilepsy Foundation, said: \u201cFor those living with intractable seizures caused by LGS and Dravet syndrome, Epidiolex represents a true medical advancement.\u201d</p> <p>The most common side effects in the clinical trials were sleepiness, elevated liver enzymes that can cause liver injury (generally mild), diarrhoea, insomnia and infections. Among other epilepsy drugs, the most serious risks include suicidal thoughts and attempts.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jun/19/home-secretary-sajid-javid-announces-review-into-medicinal-cannabis-use\">Home secretary announces review into medicinal cannabis use</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jun/19/home-secretary-sajid-javid-announces-review-into-medicinal-cannabis-use\">UK home secretary has just launched a review into medicinal uses of cannabis</a> following public pressure from the families of two sick children: 12-year-old Billy Caldwell and six-year-old Alfie Dingley, who have forms of intractable epilepsy that appear to be eased by the use of cannabis oil.</p> <p>GW\u2019s chief executive, Justin Gover, stressed that Epidiolex was a prescription drug that had been shown to be effective in reducing seizures in clinical trials. \u201cCannabis oils are a very different thing.

      "bodyText": "BMW has said it will be forced to close its production sites in the UK, putting 8,000 jobs at risk, if components for Mini and Rolls-Royce cars are caught up in customs delays after Brexit. In its starkest warning over Brexit yet, the customs manager of the German carmaker\u2019s UK operations said its manufacturing set-up would not be able to cope with obstructions to its supply chain. \u201cWe always said we can do our best and prepare everything, but if, at the end of the day the supply chain will have a stop at the border, then we cannot produce our products in the UK,\u201d Stephan Freismuth told the Financial Times. BMW employs 8,000 people in the UK, including 4,500 at its flagship plant in Cowley, Oxford, where it produces the Mini. The BMW warning comes ahead of of a key motor manufacturing industry conference on Tuesday where a series of automotive executives from companies with major UK manufacturing operations are expected to express serious concerns about the future of their businesses. The industry hopes a series of warnings from companies including Honda, Volvo and Ford will act as a wake-up call to Theresa May who made exiting the customs union and the single market one of her early red lines. Freismuth said: \u201cWe don\u2019t want to give up our UK plants. We do our best to maintain business continuity.\u201d He added: \u201cIf you have a stop for one day, it costs a lot of money, but at the end if there are more stops our management has to decide how this can be sorted.\u201d BMW has four plants in the UK, including a Rolls-Royce assembly unit in Goodwood in Sussex and an engine plant at Hams Hall in Birmingham. It also has a metal-pressing facility in Swindon. On Saturday thousands of workers enjoyed a summer family fair at the flagship Mini plant in Oxford where food, a ferris wheel and music were laid on by the company. A full or part closure would have a devastating impact for the surrounding area, the poorest part of Oxford, which relies heavily on BMW for employment. The car industry employs about 860,000 people in the UK with virtually all production relying on just-in-time processes, the term used to describe components arriving seamlessly from multiple domestic and international destinations in order to avoid costly stockpiling of parts. The port of Dover and Getlink, which runs Eurotunnel, have said even a two-minute delay at the ports could mean queues up to 17-miles long, with severe consequences for all just-in-time production and the supply of fresh produce. BMW\u2019s warning came just days after Airbus, an important employer in Wales and the Bristol area, said it would be forced to leave the UK if Brexit leads to its operations becoming uncompetitive. The Airbus intervention on Friday was initially greeted with dismay by the government, with the health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, castigating the Franco-German maker of the A380 aircraft for making \u201cinappropriate\u201d remarks. The foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, was also reported to have reacted privately by saying, \u201cFuck business.\u201d Last week the port of Dover warned there could be emergency traffic congestion management, including turning parts of the M20 into a lorry park, if there were any delays at the port. On Tuesday morning the chief executive of the society of Motor Manufacturers and Trade is expected to open the trade body\u2019s automotive summit with a strong message to the government. The Japanese ambassador to Britain is also scheduled to speak and is expected to voice concern about the future of Nissan\u2019s Sunderland factory, Toyota\u2019s Derby operations, and Honda\u2019s Swindon site post-Brexit. BMW\u2019s warning came hours after business leaders from the US, Canada, Japan and India told the British government to solve the Brexit issue urgently or put more than \u00a3100bn worth of trade at risk.",

    "webTitle": "Government rejects plan for \u00a31.3bn tidal lagoon in Swansea", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The government has rejected plans for a \u00a31.3bn tidal lagoon in Swansea Bay, dashing industry hopes of Britain leading development of a new source of renewable energy and sparking widespread criticism. Ministers said the project, which would have been subsidised through household energy bills for decades, was too expensive compared with alternatives such as offshore windfarms and nuclear power. The business secretary, Greg Clark, told parliament he had \u201cleft no stone unturned\u201d in considering whether to support the scheme. \u201cThe inescapable conclusion of an extensive analysis is, however novel and appealing the proposal that has been made is \u2026 the cost that would be incurred by consumers and taxpayers would be so much higher than alternative sources of low-carbon power that it would be irresponsible to enter into a contract with the provider,\u201d he said. Clark said backing a series of lagoons would cost the average consumer \u00a3700 more by 2050, compared with a mix of offshore wind and nuclear power. The capital cost for the lagoon, per unit of electricity generated, would be more than three times as much as the Hinkley Point C power station, he said. The minister said the government\u2019s analysis had concluded there was little potential for cost reductions from future lagoons and limited local economic benefits. However, the long-awaited decision was condemned by the renewable energy industry, green groups and MPs. Mark Shorrock, the chief executive of the company behind the project, Tidal Lagoon Power, accused Clark of being misinformed. \u201cThis is a vote of no interest in Wales, no confidence in British manufacturing and no care for the planet,\u201d he said. Labour said it was \u201cremarkably ironic\u201d that the announcement came on the same day as a vote on Heathrow airport expansion. Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary, said: \u201cOnce again the Tories have defied all logic and failed to make the right decision for our economy, the people of Wales and the future of our planet.\u201d Carolyn Harris, the Labour MP for Swansea East, where the lagoon would have been based, told Clark: \u201cYou will never understand the frustration and anger felt in our city today.\u201d Plaid Cymru, the Welsh nationalist party, formally tabled a vote of no confidence in the secretary of state for Wales, Alun Cairns, at the Welsh assembly. The Plaid assembly member Simon Thomas said: \u201cThe UK government has time and time again failed to invest in Wales. \u201cThe failed electrification of Wales\u2019 railways, and now the rejection of the tidal lagoon prove that the secretary of state for Wales has no credibility and is not fit to represent Wales in public office. He must resign at once.\u201d The trade body RenewableUK said it was disappointed by the rejection, while the Green party co-leader Caroline Lucas said it was \u201ca double blow\u201d because jobs and green energy production would be lost. Clark defended the government\u2019s stance, saying it believed in renewable energy. He disclosed that he had more than 10 meetings this year alone with the Welsh government, which had offered a \u00a3200m equity stake or loan to make the project viable. Clark\u2019s statement comes nearly 18 months after an independent government review strongly backed the scheme. Charles Hendry, the report\u2019s author and a former energy minister, said the Swansea project would add the cost of only a pint of milk to annual energy bills and provide predictable, low-carbon electricity. Hendry told the Guardian that the government had failed to recognise the longer lifetime of lagoons compared to alternatives. \u201cThe offshore wind turbines will have to have been replaced three or four times during the lifetime of a lagoon; a nuclear plant would only last half as long,\u201d he said. The project\u2019s dismissal comes shortly after ministers said they were considering taking a multibillion-pound stake in a new nuclear power station at Wylfa in Wales. That reversed a decades-long policy of avoiding direct state ownership and will have made it possible to aim for a subsidy price much lower than the lagoon\u2019s. The Swansea scheme\u2019s planned generating capacity is about a 10th of Wylfa but backers said it could be followed by five large-scale lagoons, providing a home-grown source of renewable energy, jobs and an export opportunity. Gloucester-based Tidal Lagoon Power had hoped to agree a guaranteed power price with the government \u2013 known as a contract for difference \u2013 for the \u201cpathfinder\u201d lagoon at Swansea. The Swansea project envisaged a U-shaped breakwater built across the bay and the tide passing through 16 turbines, generating power for 155,000 homes. First proposed in 2011, the lagoon won backing from the then chancellor George Osborne, who used his 2015 budget to announce the government was commencing negotiations with Tidal Lagoon Power for the plan. Clark insisted that if future tidal lagoons could demonstrate value for money, the government would consider them. However, industry observers think Monday\u2019s rejection is likely to kill off prospects for any future lagoons in the UK. Other technologies that harness the power of the tides are still seen as having potential.",

      "bodyText": "One of the benefits of having a prime minister and Liberal party as ideologically pro-business as the Donald Trump-led Republican party is that we get a nice taste for the way things are likely to head \u2013 and it is very much towards a less equal society. Late last year, the Republican party legislated a massive tax cut for both companies and individuals that ensured the greatest cuts went toward the wealthiest. It was unfunded and would increase the budget deficit despite the fact that the Republican party has long held themselves up as the standard bearers of budget responsibility. Sound familiar? Of course conservatives don\u2019t mind budget deficits when it comes to granting tax cuts, but they inevitably return with a desire to balance the budget and when they do, they always \u2013 without fail \u2013 target government services and benefits that assist the most vulnerable. And so it was last week the Republican party announced a plan to cut Medicare (a different program to that in Australia), Medicaid and other social services. And this is why when you hear all the guff spouted from the government about their tax cut you need to always be asking how will they pay for it. Because the personal tax cuts put in place will not only make the system less progressive, in some ways the biggest impact is that combined with the company tax cut, they will greatly reduce government revenue. Those in favour of flat taxes and lower company taxes might talk crud about aspiration, but really their only aspiration is for a small government where the private sector provides a greater number of services that previously were publicly run and funded. It is the ideology that favours private education and health, and that prefers outsourcing of government services. And this matters because while progressive taxation does help reduce inequality, the big driver is what is done with those taxes. Last week, the Bureau of Statistics released its latest series on government benefits, taxes and household incomes. The survey, which is done only every five-to-six years, shows that inequality in 2015-16 was essentially unchanged from 2009-10, but remains well above where it was before the mining boom began in 2003-04: But what the data especially highlights is the impacts of income taxes, government cash benefits, and services and production taxes (such as excises and the GST) have on inequality. In 2015-16, the richest 20% of households held 49% of total private income while the poorest 20% held just 4%. Once the amount of government cash benefits (aged pension, disability and family payments etc) had been taken into account the top 20% held 45% while the share going to the poorest was up to 6%. After income tax, the richest 20%\u2019s share was down to 42% and the poorest was up to 7%. The next step is to consider what are known as \u201csocial benefits in kind\u201d \u2013 the dollar value benefit government services \u2013 such as education, health care, child care, housing benefits \u2013 to households. Once these have been considered the share of income to the richest 20% is down to 39% and the poorest 20% is up to 8%. Then, finally the impact of production taxes \u2013 the GST, excises and charges \u2013 is considered. Because these taxes are generally regressive it means that the share of \u201cfinal income\u201d going to the richest 20% increases \u2013 up to 40%, while for the poorest it falls back to 7%: The data allows us to see how income, taxes, and benefits are all distributed across incomes. Cash benefits, for example, are very much targeted towards the poorest, while social benefits are more equally shared. Similarly, while income taxes are more weighted towards the richest, the burden of production taxes is much more evenly shared: When we look at the taxes paid as a percentage of final income, the progressivity of income tax and regressive nature of taxes like the GST is made quite clear. The richest 20% pay on average 32% of their final income in income tax, while the middle income quintile pay just 14%. But on production taxes, the richest 20% pay just 9% while the middle income quintile pay 10%: The reason of course is that while the average costs of living for wealthier people is generally higher than that of poorer people, the cost of buying goods and services does not increase in line with your income. Thus taxes like the GST will inevitably be less progressive, and often regressive. The distribution of cash benefits on the other hand a very much targeted towards the poorest, while government services are more even distributed \u2013 because while you may not qualify for a government cash benefit, universal education and health ensure a wide range of households are able to receive the benefit: I have argued in the past that this is a very good thing. As soon as you start limiting services such as health and education on the basis of income, you quickly see the level of that service decline and a drive for it to be cut. It also leads to situation such as we saw this week in a report by Anglicare on Centrelink \u2013 where the government treats those who use the service with contempt and where a desire to cut costs through automation actually makes a bad situation worse. The data from the Bureau of Statistics also allows us to see the impact of taxes, cash benefits and social services on inequality. The Gini coeffient in 2015-16, which measures inequality of a scale of 0 to 1 (a higher value meaning greater inequality), of private incomes was 0.442. But after cash benefits, it fell to 0.361 and then 0.241 after income taxes. The impact of social benefits reduced it even further to 0.241, before taxes like the GST caused it to rise slightly to 0.249: While our progressive income tax system does reduce inequality, it is what is done with government revenue that really does the heavy lifting. And this is the problem with the government\u2019s tax plan. It both reduces the progressive nature of our income tax system, shifts a greater share of revenue to taxes like the GST, and because of the vast cost of the tax cuts, the government will have to reduce the amount it spends on cash benefits and services. It adds up to a policy that will almost assuredly make Australia a less equal society, and so obvious is this outcome, you could be forgiven for thinking it was the intention.

      "bodyText": "Europe\u2019s top banking regulator has warned the financial industry its preparations for Brexit are \u201cinadequate\u201d and urgently need pushing forward as Britain moves closer to leaving the EU. Sounding the alarm two years after the Brexit vote, the European Banking Authority told City banks they needed to \u201crapidly advance\u201d their planning for a hard Brexit \u2013 potentially putting the Bank of England at odds with the EU\u2019s top regulator. The EBA said banks could not yet rely on the transition period agreed in principle by Theresa May with Brussels, which extends Britain\u2019s departure date from March next year to the end of 2020. While the deal should help maintain the status quo for City banks, it has yet to be formally adopted because it will form part of the wider Brexit divorce settlement. In an opinion paper published on Monday, the top EU banking regulator said major banks should push ahead on the assumption that Britain crashes out without a Brexit deal in 10 months time. Andrea Enria, the chairman of the EBA, said: \u201cFirms cannot take for granted that they continue to operate as at present, nor can they rely on as yet unrealised political agreements or public policy interventions\u201d The comments are at odds with reassurances put forward by the Bank of England after May agreed to the terms of the transition deal in March, which was seen by the City as a key requirement for keeping jobs in London and helping banks to rearrange their operations to keep trading in Britain after Brexit. Britain and Brussels have been at loggerheads over the future of the banking industry and matters of financial stability since the referendum two years ago, with City bank executives caught in the middle of the political tussle. Although London is the banking and financial hub of Europe, the City\u2019s continental rivals such as Paris, Frankfurt and Dublin are vying to take business that becomes available in the wake of Brexit. British banks, including HSBC, have warned they could move at least 1,000 jobs to the French capital after Brexit, while Barclays has picked Dublin as its new EU hub and Royal Bank of Scotland has said it could move more business to Amsterdam. While the governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, has warned the fallout for the finance industry is the single issue that makes him most \u201cnervous\u201d from the number of potential problems a disorderly Brexit could cause for the UK economy, the Bank has previously argued that adequate steps in the UK have been taken to prepare the industry for Brexit. There is growing frustration among senior British officials that European financial regulators have not gone far enough to prepare for Brexit. The UK government has said it will act to allow European firms to service financial contracts in Britain after Brexit, although no such reciprocal steps have been taken as yet by European authorities. The Bank has said UK and EU legislation is needed to ensure continuity in contracts that span many years in some cases covering financial services such as banking and insurance. The EU has shown no willingness to legislate and the EBA said no public solution may be proposed or even agreed in time. The EBA \u2013 itself in the process of moving from London to Paris because of Brexit \u2013 said banks needed to take greater steps to evaluate the risks to their balance sheets from cross-border contracts. \u201cIt is imperative that financial institutions in the EU27 and in the UK identify potential exposures and risk channels that may be affected, and the possible implications of the potential departure of the UK without a ratified withdrawal agreement in place,\u201d the EBA said.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The escalation of trade tensions has sent investors scurrying for the sidelines, amid growing fears of an all out global trade war. Reports that Donald Trump planned to block Chinese companies investing in US tech companies and could also restrict tech exports to China set the tone for the day. Comments from the US treasury secretary that the reports were inaccurate did little to limit the damage, especially since Steve Mnuchin suggested the restrictions might not apply just to China. On top of that, the impact of EU tariffs at a company level was demonstrated by the decision of motor bike maker Harley-Davidson to move some production out of the US. The final impact on European markets was pretty grim: The FTSE 100 fell 2.24% or 172.43 points to 7509.84, its worst daily performance since 6 February this year Germany\u2019s Dax, already weak on worries about the impact of tariffs on its key car producers, dropped 2.46% to 12,270.33 France\u2019s Cac closed down 1.92% at 5283.86 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB finished 2.44% lower at 21,355.19 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 1.78% at 9617.9 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 382 points or 1.55%. Here\u2019s our latest report on the trade wars and Harley-Davidson move which is helping cause the market woes: On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Unsurprisingly in the current circumstances, the VIX volatility index is moving higher: Amid the increasing trade tensions, things could get worse from here for markets, says Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index: Trade war fears appear to be ramping up almost daily. Initially traders were rather complacent that Trump\u2019s threats were just a hardball negotiating tactic. However, he has more than proved that his intentions are far more serious and damaging; this realisation has struck market sentiment hard. Global equities are falling sharply today, with indices on both sides of the Atlantic succumbing to losses of over 1%. The fear that is driving the markets here is at what point does this end? How much damage needs to be done to the economies involved and global trade in order for Trump to decide enough. This is a huge uncertainty in this very dangerous game of economic \u201cchicken\u201d, as investors are starting to see US \u2013 Sino relations sink past the point of no return. In the absence of any optimistic news over the global trading climate, we can expect the current sell off to intensify over the coming sessions. Regarding that tweet from US treasury secretary Mnuchin, Chris Beauchamp at IG said: The new week has begun on a firmly negative footing, as equity indices around the globe suffer heavy losses, with trade wars getting the blame once more. What\u2019s more, the US administration itself appears divided as the Treasury Secretary tweets out that planned measures regarding intellectual property will encompass all countries and not just China. It seems the US is hell-bent on falling out with everyone, increasing the risk that trade wars will do what all the other worries of the past nine years have failed to do \u2013 namely stop the great bull market in equities. The usual havens are in demand as investors seek refuge from the turmoil, with the ten-year Treasury yield dipping below 3% once more \u2013 investor concerns about what a 3% yield would do seem awfully quaint compared to the genuine concerns about the impact of trade wars. Falling oil prices in the wake of Friday\u2019s decision by Opec to increase production - Brent crude is down 1.8% - is another factor in the day\u2019s market slump. But the trade tensions continue to dominate, and the markets may have been too complacent up until now about the impact to the global econom. Neil Wilson at Markets.com made a number of points about the state of play: First, markets have been pretty relaxed about the trade war escalation and so the events of recent days necessitate a repricing of risk that is arguably overdue. Second, Donald Trump\u2019s call for restrictions on Chinese investment in US companies does mark step up in tensions and makes a full blown trade conflict more likely. Three, taken on their own the restrictions on investments would have a bigger economic impact - i.e. on corporate earnings - than fairly small beer tariffs would if there is no escalation. Four, US equities are still just about flat for the year, which given the massive ramp up through Jan is not a terrible performance. From a technical viewpoint, as long as we see the Dow hold its 200-day SMA - which at time of writing it is managing to do - we\u2019re still in an upwards trending channel from the April lows. The US should confirm tariffs on Chinese imports and the investment curbs by the end of this week - it could be a pivotal few days but there is still some hope -albeit fading - that the White House will step back from the brink. Harley Davidson\u2019s decision to pull US jobs is a timely reminder to the administration that trade is not a zero sum game that either won or lost. Although some members of Trump\u2019s team seem to be rowing back on the Chinese reports: It is hard to know which would be better: that the US is targeting China alone on technology or that it plans to expand its attacks further afield as well. A bidding war could be on the cards for Britain\u2019s leading satellite company Inmarsat. Earlier this month US group EchoStar had a bid rejected by Inmarsat, and since then it disclosed a 3% stake in its target. Now Paris-based Eutelsat has said it is currently evaluating its own offer for Inmarsat, pushing the UK group\u2019s shares around 4% higher. Wall Street\u2019s decline is accelerating, sending other markets lower in its wake, as the global trade tensions continue to grow. Investors have been increasingly concerned about the fallout from Trump\u2019s actions on tariffs, and today\u2019s developments - the threat of more restrictions on China and Harley-Davidson cutting some US production - are confirming their worst fears. Both the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&amp;P 500 are down around 1%, with the Nasdaq Composite nearly 1.4% lower on Trump\u2019s tech plans. In Europe the FTSE 100 has dropped 1.9% while in Germany - whose car production would be hard hit by US tariffs - the Dax is down 1.8%. Shares in Carnival, the world\u2019s biggest cruise company, have dropped more than 8% after it cut its earnings forecast for 2018. In the second quarter it said revenues had risen by 10.4% with earnings per share up from 52 cents a year earlier to 78 cents, helped by higher ticket prices and on-board spending. But increased fuel costs and adverse exchange rates mean that it now expects its full year earnings to be $0.19 a share lower than it forecast in March. A weak start to trading in New York: Ding ding! The US stock market is open for trading....and trade war fears are biting. The Dow Jones industrial average has fallen by 160 points, or 0.65%, to 24,420. Technology shares are dropping, following reports that the Trump administration will block Chinese companies from investing in the US, and also restrict US tech exports to China. Alphabet (Google\u2019s parent company) is down by 1.7%, semiconductor maker nVidia is down 2.1% and aircraft maker Boeing is down 2%. Harley Davidson is also dropping, down 2% after outlining its response to Europe\u2019s new tariffs on US goods. Bloomberg points out that Harley\u2019s sales in Europe hit their highest level since 2011 last year (as a share of total sales). Clearly the company can\u2019t afford to lose sales in such a \u2018critical market\u2019 (which is why it will swallow the tariff cost itself, while it moves production out of America). Here\u2019s some reaction to Harley-Davidson\u2019s plans to move some US production overseas, from former White House press spokesman Tony Fratto.... ING economist Carsten Brzeski isn\u2019t impressed either: Peter Alexander of NBC News points out that Donald Trump has previously hailed Harley-Davidson as a great US business. CNN has a good first take on the Harley-Davidson news: Harley-Davidson is already taking a hit in the trade fight between President Trump and European allies. The company is shifting some production of motorcycles for European customers out of the United States to avoid EU retaliatory tariffs. The EU is imposing tariffs on $3.2 billion worth of American goods, including motorcycles, orange juice, bourbon, peanut butter, motorboats, cigarettes and denim. They are a response to the Trump administration\u2019s tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from Europe. For motorcycles, the EU is raising its 6% tariff to 31%. That will make each bike about $2,200 more expensive to export, Harley said. Harley is not raising prices for customers. The company said it will take a hit of $30 million to $45 million for the rest of this year. Harley-Davidson\u2019s (HOG) stock fell 2% in premarket trading. Donald Trump won\u2019t be happy to hear that Harley-Davidson is moving some production out of America. The president singled out the motorcycle maker in his first State of the Union speech in February 2017, telling Congress that he would help companies like Harley-Davidson sell their goods abroad. As the new president put it: I just met with officials and workers from a great American company, Harley-Davidson. In fact, they proudly displayed five of their magnificent motorcycles, made in the USA, on the front lawn of the White House. At our meeting, I asked them, how are you doing, how is business? They said that it\u2019s good. I asked them further how they are doing with other countries, mainly international sales. They told me \u2014 without even complaining because they have been mistreated for so long that they have become used to it \u2014 that it is very hard to do business with other countries because they tax our goods at such a high rate. They said that in one case another country taxed their motorcycles at 100 percent. They weren\u2019t even asking for change. But I am. I believe strongly in free trade but it also has to be FAIR TRADE. Instead, Trump has provoked the European Union into imposing higher tariffs on \u00a32.5bn of US imports, by slapping tariffs on steel and aluminium imports into America. Harley-Davidson isn\u2019t the only US company being hurt by Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs. A nail manufacturer in the mid-west state of Missouri says it has lost 50% of its business in two weeks, thanks to the new tariffs on steel imports. Mid Continent Nail Corporation imports steel wire from Mexico, so has seen prices surge to uncompetitive levels thanks to the 25% tariff on imports imposed by Trump earlier this year. The company has already laid off 60 temporary staff, and could axe another 200 by the end of July unless it gets a tariff exemption, quickly. According to local news outlet Missourinet, Mid Continent Nail Corporation produces half of the nails made in America, but has seen orders tumble as customers find cheaper products elsewhere. Shares in Harley-Davidson have fallen almost 2% in pre-market trading in New York. Traders are calculating that absorbing the $100m annual cost of Europe\u2019s new tariffs will hurt Harley\u2019s profits. We don\u2019t yet know how many US jobs will be affected by Harley-Davidson\u2019s decision to move some production from America to Europe. But it\u2019s possible that the company\u2019s base in Milwaukee, Wisconsin could be hit badly. Wisconsin is one of the rural states that backed Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election, heartened by his promise to Make America Great Again and bring jobs back home. Harley\u2019s announcement, though, shows that trade wars aren\u2019t as \u201cgood and easy to win\u201d as Trump once claimed.... NEWSFLASH: Harley-Davidson is planning to move some manufacturing out of America in response to Europe\u2019s new tariffs on motorcycle imports. Harley-Davidson has just announced that the EU\u2019s tariffs will have a serious impact on its business. The average tariffs on a Harley will rose to 31%, from 6% today, adding $2,200 to the average price of a motorcycle exported from the US to Europe. Such a burden could make Harley\u2019s uncompetitive in Europe. So the company has decided it must shift production of motorcycles for EU destinations from the US to its international facilities to avoid the tariff burden. The company says: Harley-Davidson expects ramping-up production in international plants will require incremental investment and could take at least 9 to 18 months to be fully complete. It says this is the \u201conly sustainable option\u201d to ensure Harleys can still be sold in Europe (where it sold almost 40,000 last year). It says: Increasing international production to alleviate the EU tariff burden is not the company\u2019s preference, but represents the only sustainable option to make its motorcycles accessible to customers in the EU and maintain a viable business in Europe. That could be serious blow to Harley workers in America - and a stark example of the damage that a trade dispute can cause. Europe implemented tariffs on imports of US goods, including motorbikes and bourbon, in response to Donald Trump\u2019s new tariffs on steel and aluminium. In the short term, Harley says it will absorb the cost of the tariffs, rather than passing it onto customers - costing it up t0 $100m per year It says: Harley-Davidson believes the tremendous cost increase, if passed onto its dealers and retail customers, would have an immediate and lasting detrimental impact to its business in the region, reducing customer access to Harley-Davidson products and negatively impacting the sustainability of its dealers\u2019 businesses. Therefore, Harley-Davidson will not raise its manufacturer\u2019s suggested retail prices or wholesale prices to its dealers to cover the costs of the retaliatory tariffs. The Stoxx 600 index of European shares is on track for its biggest one-day fall in a month, according to Reuters data. European car firms are partly to blame, following Trump\u2019s threat to impose 20% tariffs on auto imports from the EU. Renault are down 2.8%, Daimler has lost 2.5, while car parts firm Continental has shed 3.6% (fewer car sales means less demand for tires and brakes). Analysts at FXPro say traders are shunning riskier assets, thanks to Donald Trump\u2019s repeated threats to impose tariffs on America\u2019s trading partners. Over the weekend President Trump indicated that if trade barriers and tariffs against the US were not removed that he would have no choice but to add further sanctions against those countries targeting the US. The stock market selloff is gathering pace. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 is now down 96 points, or 1.2%. Mining stocks are helping to drive the selloff, with Anglo American down 3.3% and Antofagasta losing 2.6% - and dragging the sector down to a seven-week low. That reflects concerns that a trade war will hurt global growth, and dampen demand for commodities like iron ore, copper and nickel. Oil giants are also falling, matching a drop in the price of crude after the Opec cartel agreed to raise production levels last week. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says: With a troublesome US open on the horizon, the European indices saw their losses intensify as Monday went on. The FTSE was one of the worst performers at the start of the week. Not only was the UK index dealing with the same trade war fears gripping its peers, it also had to process Brent Crude\u2019s 1.2% decline, a move that took the black stuff back towards $74.50 per barrel and left Shell and BP down 1.1% and 1.8% respectively. This in turn forced the FTSE 90 points lower, taking the index back under 7600 and only 50 points away from last Thursday\u2019s 7 week nadir. Turkey\u2019s stock market is defying today\u2019s downturn, after Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan was reelected as the country\u2019s president last night. The Istanbul bourse has jumped by 1%, although the Turkish lira is sliding after an early rally. Erdo\u011fan\u2019s AKP party won 52.5% of the votes, giving it an unexpected outright majority in a crucial election for Turkey\u2019s future. Turkey\u2019s presidency has sweeping new powers to appoint officials and set security policies, following a constitutional shake-up last year. Erdo\u011fan has promised to use his new powers to fight terrorism and improve Turkey\u2019s troubled economy. But having overseen a crackdown since an attempted coup in 2016, Erdo\u011fan is likely to keep running Turkey in an autocratic manner. Vincent-Fre\u011bde\u011bric Mivelaz of Swiss Bank explains: Erdogan is likely to act unilaterally (in politics and economics) without consulting the opposition. Among the five parties making the parliamentary threshold of winning 10% of votes, cooperation will not be easy. The constitutional reform of April 2017 reinforces the power of the president (abolishing the office of the Prime Minister, allowing direct appointment of top officials, allowing intervention in the legal system and state-of-emergency powers) and its allies in the Nationalist Movement Party in the parliament. Erdogan\u2019s \u201cPeople\u2019s Alliance\u201d is projected to win 342 seats out of 600 in the parliament, giving little power to the opposition. Emerging markets expert Charlie Robertson of Renaissance Capital warns that Turkey faces troubles ahead. The US stock market is heading for losses when trading begins in almost four hours time. The futures market suggests the Dow Jones industrial average will drop by 150 point, or 0.7%. The technology-focused Nasdaq could lose 1%, amid concerns that tech companies are being dragged into Donald Trump\u2019s trade dispute with China. China\u2019s central bank tried to calm nervous investors yesterday. The People\u2019s Bank of China relaxed the rules on commercial banks, allowing them to hold less cash. That should encourage them to pump more than $100bn of liquidity into the economy, to help Chinese firms. But this wasn\u2019t enough to prevent another day of falling share prices in Shanghai - where the market lost more than 1% today. After two hours trading, European stock markets are falling deeper into the red. The FTSE 100 has now shed almost 1%, down 70 points at 7612. Germany\u2019s DAX has lost 1.2%, helping to knock the Europe-wide Stoxx 600 down by around 1% too. Ken Odeluga, market analyst at City Index, says it\u2019s a Blue Monday in the markets. The dark mood over global markets returns, on increasing pessimism that a full-blown U.S.-China trade war may be unavoidable. Technology firms are leading the selloff, following those reports that American firms will be blocked from selling some tech to China - and that Chinese firms will not be allowed to invest in US rivals. In London, IT firm Micro Focus has fallen over 4%. Chipmakers such as BE Semiconductor (-3.7%) and Infinion (-2.7%) are also suffering. Odeluga explains why the markets are worried: The latest White House trade restriction against China might be an unprecedented ban of firms, at least 25% Chinese-owned, from investing in \u201cindustrially significant\u201d U.S. technology companies. If the Treasury proposals, outlines of which were reported by the Wall Street Journal, are enacted, Beijing would have little choice but to react in kind. That could mean potential clampdowns on U.S. technology firms active in China, from the smallest to the largest. Newsflash: EU banks aren\u2019t properly prepared for the risk of a hard Brexit, according to the industry\u2019s top European watchdog. In a new report, the European Banking Authority has warned that financial institutions haven\u2019t drawn up contingency plans in case Britain leaves the EU without a deal in March 2019. Crucially, the EBA is concerned that London and Brussels may not agree a transition deal that would allow UK-based banks to maintain their current links with Europe, and vice versa. The EBA also urges banks not to assume that politicians will find a magic solution to the trillions of pounds worth of cross-Channel contracts that could be left in limbo after Brexit. The EBA warns that: a) progress in the preparations of financial institutions for the potential departure of the UK from the EU without a ratified withdrawal agreement in March 2019 is inadequate; b) the recent political agreement on a transition period, while welcome, does not provide any legal certainty until a withdrawal agreement is ratified at the end of the process for the departure of the UK from the EU; c) there remains a material possibility that, despite the best efforts of both sides to conclude a ratified withdrawal agreement, this may not be possible, in which case the UK would leave the EU on 30 March 2019 by operation of law without a transition period; and d) the necessary mitigating actions take time, and should be pursued without further delay Here\u2019s the full report Ouch: German business morale has deteriorated, as the threat of a trade war casts a shadow over Europe\u2019s largest economy. Munich\u2019s IFO institute has reported its business climate index has dropped to 101.8 this month, down from 102.3 in May. That\u2019s a sign that German businesses are finding life tougher this year. IFO chief Clemens Fuest explained. Companies were less satisfied with their current business situation. Their business expectations, by contrast, remained slightly optimistic. The tailwind enjoyed by the German economy is calming down. After a strong 2017, the IFO survey has been deteriorating for much of this year. Carsten Brzeski of ING points out that domestic political tensions in Germany are also hurting the economy, as Angela Merkel\u2019s coalition threatens to split over migration The next two weeks could dramatically change the political landscape in Germany and in a worst case scenario even lead to a fall of the government and new elections. For the economy, this would mean further delays of the urgently needed investments, new structural reforms and strengthening of the monetary union. But there\u2019s always hope... Six drops and one stagnation in the last seven months or in other (soccer) words: six losses and one draw. This is clearly not a promising trend. However, as seen last Saturday in the World Cup match between Germany and Sweden, never count out Germany. Hope dies last, even if it takes until the very last second. Even before these latest threats, there were concerns that trade war fears are hurting the global economy. Yesterday the Bank of International Settlements (which represents central banks) warned that growth could falter if nations imposed more protectionist measures on each other. BIS chief Agust\u00edn Carstens warned: \u201cIndeed, there are signs that the rise in uncertainty associated with the first protectionist steps and the ratcheting up of rhetoric have already been inhibiting investment.\u201d The Wall Street Journal says the Trump administration is determined to protect US companies from having their tech secrets snaffled by Chinese rivals. We\u2019ve got trillions of dollars seeking our crown jewels of technology,\u201d said White House trade adviser Peter Navarro last week. \u201cThere has to be a defense against that.\u201d The Financial Times says Chinese investment in America could tumble, if Trump blocks China from buying into US tech companies. According to the Rhodium Group consultancy, Chinese foreign direct investment in the US plunged more than 90 per cent to just $1.8bn in the first half of 2018 compared with the same period last year. In 2016, Chinese companies made a record $46bn in foreign direct investment in the US. The exact scope of the investment measures has been the subject of internal discussions in the Trump administration in recent days, say people familiar with the debate. It is unclear how quickly restrictions would take effect and if they would apply to Chinese investments in venture capital funds, which provide much of the seed money for US technology start-ups. But according to officials and people briefed on the discussions, the administration has decided to restrict China\u2019s ability to invest in or acquire US companies in the industries identified by Beijing in its so-called Made in China 2025 plan. Xi Jinping, China\u2019s president, has set a goal of leading the world in those ten sectors, which include aerospace, AI, robotics, medical devices and railways. US firms are concerned that they\u2019ll be blocked from selling some tech products to China, says Politico: Like the tariffs that Trump imposed on $50 billion in Chinese imports \u2014 and those he has threatened to impose on $400 billion more if Beijing retaliates \u2014 the new investment restrictions and export controls are intended to pressure China to stop unfair trade practices that threaten the United States\u2019 technological leadership. Trump is expected to invoke his emergency powers to protect national and economic security to put the restrictions in place. But the administration is already getting pushback from bureaucrats who think it would be a misuse of the export control system, and from businesses that fear the approach will further disadvantage U.S. firms trying to enter the Chinese market Trump\u2019s latest threat against China has hit European markets. Shares are down across the region in early trading, with Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 and Germany\u2019s DAX both losing 0.6%. The threat that Chinese firms could be blocked from investing in US tech companies has worried the City, as Jasper Lawler of CMC Markets explains In the latest escalation of the trade war Trump has decided to take aim at Chinese investments. A draft series of restrictions on inbound Chinese investments are due to be published later this week, in a move which could have great long-term consequences on the US \u2013 Sino economic relationship. Once again details remain very sketchy, with the scope of such a measure still under discussion. It is now very difficult to get away from the fact that neither side has any intention of backing down in this game of economic \u201cchicken\u201d. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Fears of a trade war between America and China have ratcheted up another notch, hitting confidence in the markets. Overnight, it\u2019s emerged that President Donald Trump is drawing up a fresh crackdown on Chinese investment in the US. New rules, which could be announced within days, would prevent firms with at least 25% Chinese ownership from acquiring American companies involved in \u2018industrially significant technology\u2019, such as robotics, electronic cars and aerospace. Trump is also planning to restrict US companies from selling certain technologies to China, using \u201cenhanced export controls\u201d, according to the Wall Street Journal. Such a move would further damage relations between Washington and Beijing, following the threat of tit-for-tat tariffs. The Trump administration is embracing increasingly aggressive restrictions on what they see as China\u2019s unfair trade practices. These latest measures could undermine China\u2019s efforts to become a world leader in emerging technologies. As the WSJ explains: The twin initiatives, set to be announced by the end of the week, are designed to prevent Beijing from moving ahead with plans outlined in its \u201cmade in China 2025\u201d report to become a global leader in 10 broad areas of technology. The Treasury Department is crafting rules that would block firms with at least 25% Chinese ownership from buying companies involved in what the White House calls \u201cindustrially significant technology.\u201d The ceiling may end up lower than that, according to people familiar with discussions finalizing the plans. The news has hit Asian markets, with Japan\u2019s Nikkei and China\u2019s Shanghai Composite indices both falling by 1%. European stock markets are expected to follow suit, with the FTSE 100 dropping in early trading. Last Friday, Trump threatened to impose new tariffs on European car makers, declaring that they should set up factories in America instead. That rocked the share prices of Fiat, BMW and Daimler. Trump also fired a warning shot at America\u2019s trade partners over the weekend. The president tweeted that they must drop trade barriers and tariffs - even as he slaps them on US imports - or else... No wonder investors are worried.... Also coming up today... We get the new IFO survey of German business morale, which may show another decline, plus the latest US home sales. In Dublin, Ireland\u2019s central bank and the International Monetary Fund are hosting a two-day conference on \u201cthe euro at 20\u201d. It will examine the euro\u2019s performance over its first two (sometimes turbulent) decades. IMF Christine Lagarde will give the opening speech this morning.

Neil Wilson at Markets.com made a number of points about the state of play:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>First, markets have been pretty relaxed about the trade war escalation and so the events of recent days necessitate a repricing of risk that is arguably overdue. </p> <p>Second, Donald Trump\u2019s call for restrictions on Chinese investment in US companies does mark step up in tensions and makes a full blown trade conflict more likely. Three, taken on their own the restrictions on investments would have a bigger economic impact - i.e. on corporate earnings - than fairly small beer tariffs would if there is no escalation. Four, US equities are still just about flat for the year, which given the massive ramp up through Jan is not a terrible performance. From a technical viewpoint, as long as we see the Dow hold its 200-day SMA - which at time of writing it is managing to do - we\u2019re still in an upwards trending channel from the April lows. </p> <p>The US should confirm tariffs on Chinese imports and the investment curbs by the end of this week - it could be a pivotal few days but there is still some hope -albeit fading - that the White House will step back from the brink. Harley Davidson\u2019s decision to pull US jobs is a timely reminder to the administration that trade is not a zero sum game that either won or lost.</p> </blockquote> <p>Although some members of Trump\u2019s team seem to be rowing back on the Chinese reports:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/stevenmnuchin1/status/1011258207182966786\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">On behalf of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@realDonaldTrump</a>, the stories on investment restrictions in Bloomberg &amp; WSJ are false, fake news.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The grocery industry watchdog is hoping to win new powers to oversee Amazon and Boots after receiving numerous complaints about their treatment of suppliers. Christine Tacon, the Grocery Code Adjudicator (GCA), already oversees 10 retailers including the big four supermarkets \u2013 Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s, Asda and Morrisons \u2013 and has the power to issue multi-million pound fines if suppliers are treated poorly. The competition watchdog is currently assessing a group of up to four additional retailers that could come under Tacon\u2019s remit from August, if it finds their grocery sales amount to \u00a31bn or more. Amazon\u2019s shift into groceries, after buying Wholefoods Market and teaming up with Morrisons for its Amazon Fresh food home deliveries, is thought to have potentially put it within the GCA\u2019s sights, while Boots\u2019s sale of sandwiches and drinks as well as shampoo, toothpaste and suncream, may also put the health and beauty chain in the frame. Tacon said she was particularly keen to include those retailers that were treating suppliers poorly while competing directly with the 10 companies she currently oversees. She said Boots and Amazon were two of the chains mentioned by suppliers. Complaints relating to Amazon had been about not paying in full. Complaints relating to Boots had been about retrospective payments and variation to agreements. After this article was published, Boots said that there was nothing untoward in such practices, which were standard in the industry. \u201cPayments are always agreed in advance with suppliers and are used for promotional activity to the benefit of consumers,\u201d the company said in a letter to the Guardian. Tacon said she could not be certain the two retailers will come under her remit as there was \u201cno cast-iron definition\u201d of groceries, and it was difficult to assess the amount of relevant goods they sold. She said retailers might argue that products such as toothpaste, for example, should not be included, which might take their overall grocery turnover below the \u00a31bn cut-off point. The potential extension of GCA\u2019s powers comes as Tacon named Asda as the worst of the UK\u2019s big four supermarkets in its treatment of suppliers for the second year in a row. The Walmart-owned chain did better than the Co-op, which is currently under investigation by the watchdog, and Iceland, which once again hit the bottom of the pile, but sits well behind its major rivals, according to CGA\u2019s survey of 1,000 suppliers. About 7% of Asda\u2019s suppliers said it rarely stuck to the legally binding industry code which covers trade terms and 1% said it never did so. That compares to just 3% of Tesco suppliers who say it rarely sticks to the code while none said it never complied. Still, Tacon said Asda had shown improvement in the past year. \u201cI am delighted to report significant improvements across all regulated retailers,\u201d she added. In one measure of her powers, Tesco, which faced a major investigation by the GCA in 2015, has overtaken Sainsbury\u2019s and Waitrose to become the major supermarket best rated by suppliers, although it still sits behind Aldi, which has come top of the annual survey. Tacon said she hoped Asda\u2019s dealings with food producers and grocery manufacturers would improve if its planned merger with Sainsbury\u2019s went ahead, because the latter had better systems in place for dealing with suppliers and had consistently scored better in the annual survey. Nevertheless, she warned that she could not prevent suppliers being squeezed by a new bigger retailer after the merger as she did not have the power to intervene when suppliers were agreeing prices with retailers. \u201cIf a company is prepared to supply something at a lower price who am I to interfere? We end up with better prices for consumers,\u201d she said. Tacon said she was open to the idea of her remit being extended in some way but warned \u201cI\u2019m not the industry fairy godmother\u201d highlighting she had only been able to improve practices at the supermarkets because her role was clearly defined and backed by strong powers. She added the vast majority of suppliers now felt that retailers were sticking to the industry code and her \u201ccollaborative, business-focused approach\u201d was getting results. The biggest issue faced by suppliers is now a delay in payments which 19% said they had experienced. \u2022 This article was amended on 12 July 2018 to clarify the different types of complaints that Ms Tacon said suppliers had made to her about Amazon and about Boots, and to add Boots\u2019 response.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Experts have criticised Morrisons\u2019 decision to switch from plastic to paper bags for fruit and vegetables, branding it a retrograde step for efforts to tackle climate change. This week the supermarket ditched transparent plastic bags in favour of recyclable paper ones, in a move it said was prompted by customers\u2019 worries over pollution. But the step is likely to have unintended consequences and trade one environmental challenge for another. The Environment Agency found that paper carrier bags, across their lifecycle of production, use and disposal, had a greater global-warming impact than plastic ones. The agency\u2019s study found paper ones were only better than plastic if they were used four or more times, but that was unlikely due to durability of paper bags. While the research was published seven years ago, the government\u2019s top waste and recycling advisers, Wrap, said the findings were still relevant today. Chris Goodall, an author and environmental expert, said: \u201cThis is a retrograde step, moving back to paper.\u201d He agreed the impact of plastic pollution on marine life was very serious, but said: \u201cMost of the plastic in the sea comes from a small number of rivers, it does not come from me buying green beans in Morrisons.\u201d Compared to using plastic bags for loose fruit and vegetable, paper bags were a backwards step in climate and energy use terms, Goodall said. One reason for the greater climate impact is that using paper will lessen the life expectancy of produce, he argued, leading to more food waste in landfill, where it generates methane, a powerful greenhouse gas. However, Friends of the Earth said that it welcomed Morrisons\u2019 switch and that green issues other than climate change should be factored in. Julian Kirby, a campaigner at the group, said: \u201cThe thing about climate change is because it\u2019s such a huge worry it has eclipsed other very serious environmental and health concerns, and that would include \u2026 pollution. \u201cWith a paper bag, if it escapes into the environment it will biodegrade very soon. That is not the case with a plastic one.\u201d The supermarket appeared aware of the trade-off, saying it had weighed the environmental impact of paper against the potential pollution from plastic. \u201cWe have listened to customers and they are telling us that the overuse of plastic is the most important environmental issue for us to deal with,\u201d a spokesperson said.",

One reason for the greater climate impact is that using paper will lessen the life expectancy of produce, he argued, leading to more food waste in landfill, where it generates methane, a powerful greenhouse gas.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"9325c6ac-b397-44cb-8e0e-3ff1942a5580\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>Why is plastic being demonised?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Since the 1950s, 8.3bn tonnes of plastic has been produced. Plastic is seen as a versatile, indispensable product, but the environmental impact is becoming more stark. Plastic is now so pervasive that recycling systems cannot keep up and the leakage into the environment is such that by 2050 plastic in the ocean will outweigh fish. Last year scientists found plastic fibres in tap water, and plastic has been found in the stomachs of sea creatures in the deepest part of the ocean. Most plastic waste ends up in landfill sites or leaks into the natural environment, where it is causing huge damage to eco-systems on land and sea, creating near permanent contamination. According to academics in the United States, by 2015, of all the plastic waste generated since the 1950s, only 9% has been recycled, with 12% incinerated and 79% accumulated in landfill sites or the environment.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Why are the supermarkets under fire?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Producers of plastic include retailers, drinks companies and supermarkets. The Guardian revealed that supermarkets create more than half of the plastic waste in the household stream in the UK. But they refuse to reveal how much they put on to the streets and how much they pay towards recycling it. Supermarkets are under pressure to reduce their plastic packaging and campaigners argue they have the power to turn off the tap. Much of the packaging they sell to consumers is not recyclable: plastic film, black plastic trays, sleeves on drinks bottles and some coloured plastic. The Recycling Association and other experts believe supermarkets could do much more to make packaging 100% recyclable and reduce the use of plastic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Who pays to clean up the waste?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The taxpayer, overwhelmingly. Producers and retailers pay the lowest towards recycling and dealing with their waste in Europe. In other countries, the \u201cpolluter\u201d is forced to pay much more. In France, a sliding system of charges means those who put more non- recyclable material on the market pay more.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What can shoppers do to help?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Supermarkets are under pressure, not least from the prime minister, to create plastic-free aisles. A growing number of zero-waste shops are springing up and consumers are being encouraged to ask for products to be sold without plastic.</p>\n    <p><b>Sandra Laville</b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>However, Friends of the Earth said that it welcomed Morrisons\u2019 switch and that green issues other than climate change should be factored in.</p> \n<p>Julian Kirby, a campaigner at the group, said: \u201cThe thing about climate change is because it\u2019s such a huge worry it has eclipsed other very serious environmental and health concerns, and that would include \u2026 pollution. </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/15/waitrose-shamed-food-waste-shoppers-baddies\">Now Waitrose is being shamed for food waste.

      "bodyText": "Shares in Britain\u2019s biggest estate agent, Countrywide Properties, have plunged 25% after it issued its fourth profit warning in eight months and called on shareholders to raise fresh funds to cut its debt. Countrywide, the company behind Hamptons, Bairstow Eves, Taylors and Gascoigne-Pees, has been hit hard by a downturn in the housing market in London and the south-east, a botched revamp of the business and growing competition from new online firms such as Purplebricks. The shares fell to a new low of 59p after the warning; four years ago they were trading at more than 600p. \u201cThe market in the first half has continued to be subdued and we have experienced longer transaction cycles,\u201d the group said. \u201cAs previously announced, the group entered 2018 with our sales pipeline significantly below that of 2017.\u201d Countrywide said adjusted profits in the first half would be about \u00a320m lower than a year ago and the shortfall would not be made up in the second half of the year. The firm is forecasting adjusted earnings before interest, taxation, deprecation and amortisation (Ebitda) of \u00a38.1m for the first half, and \u00a344.7m for the full year \u2013 below City forecasts of \u00a351.4m. In 2017 it made profits of \u00a367.4m in what it described as a disappointing year, against \u00a383.5m in 2016. Countrywide wants to cut its debts of \u00a3192m by at least half by raising extra capital. It said its largest shareholder, the private equity firm Oaktree, and its lenders were backing the plans. Peter Long leads the company as executive chairman after the chief executive, Alison Platt, who had run the firm since 2014, resigned days after the January profit warning. He announced a \u201cback to basics\u201d recovery plan in March, which included cutting head office staff numbers by a third, the equivalent of 150 jobs. Many senior staff have left in recent years as a result of Countrywide\u2019s decision to shut 200 branches and merge its lettings and sales businesses, hitting its mid-market London business in particular. Under Platt, the group was centralised and branch managers lost the autonomy to recruit, to market locally and to price to win business. Long, the former boss of Europe\u2019s largest travel firm Tui, is seeking to reverse these moves and reshape the group by empowering regional and branch managers. He has called for senior branch staff who left during the Platt years to come back. The register of properties available for sale is broadly back to 2017 levels, up 9% since the start of the year. Demand in the property market has been hit by higher stamp duty and Britain\u2019s vote to leave the EU two years ago. House prices have been falling in London and parts of southern England, but are still rising elsewhere in the UK. Countrywide said there was no update on the search for a new chief executive. Long has been criticised for the number of boardroom positions he holds. As well as running Countrywide, he is deputy chairman of Tui, and chairman of Royal Mail and Spanish leisure park operator Parques Reunidos Servicios Centrales. He is also president of the Family Holiday Association. Anthony Codling, an analyst at Jefferies, believes Countrywide may seek to raise about \u00a3125m from investors to cut debt and fund the turnaround plan. \u201cThe underlying second-hand housing market is dreadful,\u201d he said. \u201cEven the online challengers are finding that they cannot outperform the current market conditions, and there is little to be done when homeowners stop moving.\u201d",

Made from 100% recyclable paper, they have a see-though paper strip to help shoppers and staff identify the produce inside. The move is in response to growing public concern about the huge volumes of plastic rubbish. Morrisons was a launch signatory to the UK Plastics Pact, an industry initiative that aims to reduce the use of single-use plastics and avoidable plastic waste. \u201cWe\u2019ve listened to customers\u2019 concerns about using plastic bags for fruit and vegetables and that is why we are bringing back paper bags,\u201d said Drew Kirk, a produce director at the supermarket. Customers can now also bring their own containers to Morrisons butchers and fishmongers counters, with the supermarket offering 100 loyalty card points as an incentive.",
