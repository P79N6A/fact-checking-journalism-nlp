      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s consumers and UK-focused firms are among the biggest losers one year on from the shock Brexit vote that drove the value of the pound to its lowest level in more than 30 years. On the first anniversary of the EU referendum, financial services company Hargreaves Lansdown said clear winners and losers have emerged, with the pound taking the biggest hit on the markets. Blue chip companies with a large proportion of foreign earnings are among the biggest winners. The pound tanked when the result of the referendum became clear on 24 June and 12 months on the currency is still down 15% against the dollar at just above $1.26. It is also down 14% against the euro, at about \u20ac1.13. A weaker pound has reduced the spending power of UK holidaymakers abroad, and put pressure on consumer finances by pushing up inflation to a four-year high of 2.9%. \u201cThe main financial effect of Brexit has been felt in the pound,\u201d said Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. \u201cHolidaymakers have probably been the most obvious losers from Brexit so far, though inflation is also gradually ratcheting up the pressure on consumers more broadly.\u201d The fall in the pound and tougher backdrop for household finances has also hurt the fortunes of some UK focused companies. Hargreaves Lansdown said that while the FTSE 100 was up 18% over the past year, UK focused retailers Dixons Carphone and Next had suffered big falls, with shares down 29% and 27% respectively. Cash savers were also cited in the report as losers from the Brexit vote, because of a combination of low interest rates and higher inflation. \u201cThe resurgence of inflation makes the low interest rate environment even more punitive for cash savers because their money is losing its buying power even faster,\u201d Khalaf said. The Brexit vote appeared to scupper the idea that the Bank of England would soon increase borrowing costs, with market expectations of a rate rise by 2018 plunging from 86% on the day of the referendum to 20% now. As Brexit negotiations finally got under way this week, the TUC said that 12 months after the referendum the government had failed to come up with a plan to make Brexit a success for working people. \u201cWe have spent the last year fighting for the best Brexit deal for working people \u2013 one that protects their jobs and their rights at work,\u201d said Frances O\u2019Grady, its general secretary. \u201cA no-deal Brexit would be devastating for jobs and the UK economy \u2013 and after the election result, the prime minister has no mandate for it. \u201cA good Brexit deal for working people means tariff-free and barrier-free trade with Europe. And it means a level playing field for workers\u2019 rights written into the Brexit deal. That deal must protect all current rights and make sure hardworking Brits do not miss out on new protections enjoyed by EU workers in future.\u201d Large multinationals listed on the FTSE 100 but with significant foreign earnings have been among the biggest winners from the vote, benefiting from a weaker pound. \u201cAll of the top 10 performing stocks have significant international earnings which have helped propel their stock price performance thanks to weaker sterling,\u201d Khalaf said. \u201cThere are other factors at play too however; for instance commodity producers Glencore and Antofagasta have benefited from price rises in the stuff they dig out of the ground.\u201d The biggest 10 companies listed on the FTSE 100 have become more dominant since the Brexit vote: they now account for 46% of the leading index. Stock markets elsewhere in the world have performed well over the past year. For example, the value of every \u00a3100 invested a year ago in Germany\u2019s DAX is \u00a3144, compared with \u00a3123 for the FTSE 100.

    "webTitle": "House Democrats challenge Deutsche Bank over review of Trump's accounts", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Deutsche Bank is at the centre of an escalating row on Capitol Hill after the German bank refused to respond to a congressional request for information about the bank\u2019s examination of Donald Trump\u2019s bank account and whether he had financial ties to Russia. Maxine Waters, a top Democrat on the House financial services committee, has challenged Deutsche Bank\u2019s legal rationale for refusing to volunteer information about the US president\u2019s account and an internal review the bank conducted last year. The Guardian reported in February that Deutsche Bank \u2013 whose clients include Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka; her husband, Jared Kushner; and Kushner\u2019s mother \u2013conducted a close internal examination last year of the president\u2019s personal account and the accounts of his family to gauge whether there were any suspicious connections to Russia. Deutsche Bank claimed in a response to the first congressional request that US laws prohibit it from sharing information about its customers to government agencies. But Waters and four other Democrats said in a letter that was sent to Deutsche\u2019s Washington attorneys this week that the German bank had misinterpreted the law and said privacy rules do not apply to requests made by Congress. The Democrats\u2019 letter cited a 2012 legal article written by one of Deutsche\u2019s own lawyers that said privacy statutes do not clearly address how banks should handle congressional inquiries. The Democrats are pushing for Deutsche Bank to confirm press reports \u2013 including the report in the Guardian \u2013 that the bank conducted a review of Trump\u2019s account and the accounts of his family members into possible Russia ties. The Guardian reported that the bank was looking for evidence of whether loans to Trump, which were agreed in highly unusual circumstances, may have been underpinned by financial guarantees from Moscow. Sources inside Deutsche told the Guardian that no link was found. The Democrats are also looking for information about a separate internal review of a trading scheme at Deutsche\u2019s former Moscow branch \u2013 known as a mirror trading scheme \u2013 that allegedly allowed $10bn to flow out of Russia. It is still unclear who benefited from the scheme but Deutsche reportedly reviewed the matter internally. The congressional letter to the two Deutsche attorneys \u2013 Steven Ross and Leslie Kiernan of Akin Gump Strauss \u2013 also stated that if Deutsche had any lingering liability concern about handing over information about Trump\u2019s account to Congress, that the bank should \u201csimply\u201d ask the president and his relatives for their consent. \u201cGiven President Trump\u2019s repeated assertions that he does not have ties to Russia, such disclosure would ostensibly be in his interest,\u201d the letter said. In a statement, a spokesman for Deutsche said: \u201cWe reiterate that while we seek to cooperate, we must obey the law. Our lawyers will respond to the legal questions raised by the individual members of Congress in due course. In the meantime, we continue to refer the members to the legal basis from our previous response.\u201d Deutsche extended about $300m in loans to Trump before he became president, even as the former reality television star and businessman was being shunned by other financial institutions because of his poor track record and string of failed businesses. Separately, Deutsche Bank is preparing to become the subject of new scrutiny by an independent third-party monitor who is going to be examining the bank\u2019s handling of any suspicious activity involving non-US banks that may have occurred in the last six months of 2016. Usually, banks are meant to have strong procedures in place to identify and report such activity, but Deutsche\u2019s systems have been deficient in the past. The monitor, who has not yet been named, is due to begin its review of Deutsche\u2019s activities in early July. The monitor \u2013 who will happen to be reviewing the period around the US election last year \u2013 was put in place as part of a $41m settlement with the US Federal Reserve announced at the end of May after the Fed found that the bank\u2019s US operation did not have strong enough systems to detect suspicious transactions from the period of 2011 to 2015.",

      "bodyText": "The price of British strawberries could rise by more than a third if the UK cannot ensure access to European workers after Brexit, farmers have warned. Producers have called on the government to introduce a permit scheme for seasonal workers to ensure that the expansion of soft fruit production in the UK is not brought to a halt. Their warning comes as farmers say the number of seasonal workers coming to the UK this year has already dropped by 17% this year, because the lack of clarity on the future for EU workers in post-Brexit Britain and a drop in the value of sterling have hit recruitment. The National Farmers\u2019 Union said there were more than 1,500 unfilled vacancies on British farms in May alone. A survey of labour providers by the union found that a fourfold rise in those unable to meet farms\u2019 requirements between January to May this year. The NFU\u2019s concerns come as a report commissioned by the British Summer Fruits trade body estimates that if UK-based producers are forced to move their operations to countries within the EU to ensure access to labour, the price of strawberries will rise from around \u00a32 per 400g punnet to \u00a32.75 \u2013 a jump of 37%. Replacing homegrown raspberries with imported fruit would see the price of a 200g punnet jump 50% from \u00a32 to \u00a33. Farmers say access to EU workers is vital to sustain the industry, as more than nine out of 10 seasonal pickers and packers of British soft fruit currently come from the European Union, primarily Poland, Bulgaria and Romania. Demand for seasonal staff is expected to rise to around 31,000 by 2020 if the industry continues to grow at its current pace. The soft fruit industry, which supplies raspberries, strawberries, blackberries and blueberries, is now worth more than \u00a31.2bn, up 131% in the past 20 years, largely because of a rise in homegrown strawberry production. In 1996 we ate 67,000 tonnes of strawberries a year, and by 2015 this had leapt to 168,000 tonnes \u2014a rise of 150%. The soft fruit industry is one of the UK\u2019s biggest users of EU seasonal labour as it is harder to mechanise the handling of its delicate and tricky-to-pick produce, but its warnings echo those of the wider farming community. Andrea Leadsom, the former secretary of state for the environment, food and rural affairs, who was succeeded by Michael Gove this month, had suggested that farmers invest in machinery to boost productivity. But farmers say appropriate technology requires heavy investment and will not be a solution in the short term. Laurence Olins, chairman of British Summer Fruits, which accounts for 97% of all berries supplied to UK supermarkets, said: \u201cThis is as extreme as it gets. If we do not have the pickers, we do not have a soft fruit industry. \u201cIt is inconceivable that people who voted to leave the European Union wanted to destroy an iconic and incredibly competitive British horticulture industry. And there is no letup in the demand. Sales continue to increase year on year. \u201cBut if we cannot ensure access to the seasonal workers needed to produce soft fruit in Britain, that will be an unintended consequence of Brexit \u2013 along with soaring prices and increased reliance on imports.\u201d David Kay, of Hall Hunter Partnership, a grower for Waitrose, Marks &amp; Spencer and Tesco that employs about 3,000 seasonal labourers from 20 different countries, said he had tried to recruit British workers, but had found it difficult. \u201cWe have worked with jobcentres and with ex-prisoners, but British people don\u2019t want to do these jobs,\u201d he said. British Summer Fruits says the industry is already suffering form labour shortages as the fall in the value of the pound has reduced take-home pay for EU nationals, while some feel less welcome, or even fear being attacked, since the Brexit vote. Fruit producers say labour shortages are now at their worst level since before 2004, when people from the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia were given the right to work in the UK.",

    "webTitle": "UK factory orders jump and eurozone confidence hits 16-year high \u2013 as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "And finally, European stock markets have closed for the night. In London, the FTSE 100 ended the day down 8 points at 7439, a drop of 0.1%. The jump in factory orders didn\u2019t provide much of a spark, while traders watched for developments from the Brexit talks in Brussels. European stocks ended the day higher, perhaps helped by the jump in eurozone consumer confidence. There\u2019s some relief that oil has climbed back from its seven-month lows; Brent crude is now up 1.8% today at $45.62, but still looks vulnerable. Joshua Mahony, Market Analyst at IG, says it was a day of \u2018low volatility\u2019, and few dramas: Coming on a day which is largely devoid of any major market moving events, we have seen a degree of stability that has been lacking amongst recent political instability. Improved consumer confidence in the eurozone continues the theme of recent months, with investors seeing Europe as a high growth region for the coming years despite Brexit uncertainty. This paves the way for an end of the week that will be heavily focused on the eurozone, with PMI surveys expected to continue the strength seen in recent months. Those PMIs, out tomorrow morning, will give a flash view of how eurozone companies are faring this month. And on that note, it\u2019s time to stop. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, says the jump in eurozone consumer confidence will have delighted the European Central Bank. The eurozone seems to have taken heart from the continued fall in unemployment, and consumer confidence is now at its highest level since 2001 \u2013 improving considerably on last month\u2019s ten-year high. \u201cEven the shock general election result in the UK has not dampened the mood on the continent as Brexit discussions kick-off, and chief negotiator Michel Barnier will feel he holds the strongest hand. \u201cHowever, there are still concerns over inflation, and ECB president Mario Draghi has so far steadfastly refused to taper off the eurozone stimulus programme, perhaps aware that potential banana skins could lie around the corner.\u201d Hold onto your hats, folks. Japanese bank Nomura have predicted that the Bank of England will raise interest rates at its next meeting, in August. That\u2019s a gutsy move, as BoE governor Mark Carney argued forcibly on Tuesday that it\u2019s too early for a rate hike. However, Nomura analyst George Buckley has predicted that the BoE will raise rates from 0.25% to 0.5%, back to their level before the EU referendum a year ago. Buckley writes: It has been a rollercoaster of a week when it comes to central bank commentary, with Governor Carney\u2019s Mansion House address justifying no change in interest rates but Chief Economist Haldane highlighting the need for a possible imminent reversal of last year\u2019s loosening. On balance,we have decided to change our view and now expect the MPC to raise interest rates by 25bp on 3 August. With the Bank growing increasingly intolerant of above-target inflation, it has begun to feel that weaker data would now be needed to prove the case for keeping policy on hold, rather than stronger data being required to justify higher rates. Buckley points to recent signs that the Bank is more worried about inflation, which is well over its 2% target at 2.9%. He anticipates a \u2018dovish hike\u2019, with the Bank pointing out that: a) the move being a reversal of last year\u2019s cut, b) policy is still highly accommodative, and c) future moves will be \u201cgradual and limited\u201d. Back to Greece where today\u2019s protests and the electric atmosphere that prevailed may well be a shocking wake up call for the leftist-led government. Municipal workers are warning of a \u201cvery hot summer\u201d if short-term contracts aren\u2019t replaced with permanent positions. \u201cWe will continue the fight until the end,\u201d Nikos Trakas who heads the workers\u2019 union said after the protests. \u201cFrom now on there will be huge and dynamic mobilisations with decisions being taken in the coming hours.\u201d Boom! Or do I mean Euroboom? Eurozone consumer confidence has hit its highest level since 2001, underlining how its economic recovery is on track. The EC\u2019s monthly consumer morale index has jumped to -1.3 this month, up from -3.3 in May. A negative reading may not sound much, but it\u2019s actually the strongest number in 16 years. With growth accelerating to 0.6% in the first quarter of 2017, and unemployment at a seven-year low, the eurozone is enjoying something of a purple patch. Thirty-odd years ago, David Braben was pushing back the boundaries of computer gaming when he and fellow Cambridge student Ian Bell created Elite. Today, he should be celebrating as Frontier Developments, the computer game developer he founded, posted sparkling financial results. With revenue up 75% this year, the company expects to grow operating profits by 500% to \u00a37.2m. It now expects operating profit margins to be towards the top of its previous guidance, of 15-20%. It\u2019s due to the success of two games; Planet Coaster, a theme park game.... ...and Elite Dangerous, a massive multiplayer online space adventure game that accurately simulates our whole galaxy. For those of a certain age, the original Elite was quite mind-blowing; Braben and Bell managed to squeeze an open-ended space trading and combat game into just 32kilobytes of RAM, at a time when most people were playing Chuckie Egg (younger readers, ask your parents). Elite Dangerous seems to have tapped into that nostalgia; Frontier crowd-funded the money to create the game, and is turning gamers into repeat customers by releasing regular updates. Shares in Frontier are up 6.5% this morning at 450p, compared with just 300p in mid-April.... Braben says: Our ambition now is to build on this success, continue to invest in our franchises and scale up to create a self-publishing multi-franchise success story. Our third franchise, which is based on an enduring Hollywood movie IP of global renown, is scheduled for release in calendar 2018, and we will provide more details about this exciting project later this year.\u201d Fresh protests against Greece\u2019s austerity programme are taking place today, as refuse collectors down tools and demonstrate. Associated Press has the details: Thousands of striking Greek municipal workers marched through Athens on Thursday to press for better employment status, in the latest of a series of protests that have hindered trash collection in major cities. Authorities said that about 5,000 people took part in the demonstration. Protesters briefly scuffled with police, who used tear gas to prevent them from pushing into the parliament complex. No arrests were reported, while two protesters suffered respiratory problems from the tear gas. Earlier, some demonstrators had dumped trash outside the interior ministry building. Union officials want the left-led government to grant full-time, permanent state jobs to municipal workers employed on short-term contracts that have expired or are about to expire. A high court has ruled unconstitutional a government attempt to extend the contracts of municipal trash collectors, and government officials say they are seeking an alternative solution. Union members have for days been hindering trash collection across the country, and municipal authorities in Athens and other major cities have asked the public to keep their refuse at home. Greece has been forced to drastically cut public spending and reduce state sector hiring over the past seven years under its international bailout agreements. Over in Brussels, EU leaders have been gathering for a summit where UK prime minister Theresa May will outline her Brexit plans. European Council president Donald Tusk has caused a stir, by suggesting that Brexit might not even happen. Channelling John Lennon, Tusk declared: \u201cSome of my British friends have even asked me whether Brexit could be reversed, and whether I could imagine an outcome where the UK stays part of the EU. \u201cI told them that in fact the European Union was built on dreams that seemed impossible to achieve. So, who knows? You may say I\u2019m a dreamer, but I am not the only one.\u201d More here: German Chancellor Angela Merkel, meanwhile, told reporters that that the EU must prioritise the needs of its remaining members: \u201cWe want to have talks that take place in a good spirit and we know that later we will want to work with Great Britain, but the clear focus must be on the future for the EU 27 so that we have results for the better.\u201d Back in London, shares in UK tech firm Imagination have jumped by 16% this morning, after it effectively put itself up for sale. The move comes two months after Imagination shocked the City by revealing that Apple, its biggest customer, would stop using its technology in its iPhones, iPads, and iPods. In a statement today, Imagination said it had received interest from suitors in recent weeks so had begun a formal sale process and is talking to potential bidders. It\u2019s quite a dramatic fall; not long ago, Imagination was a City darling thanks to its tie-up with Apple, which provides more than half its revenue. Neil Wilson of ETX Capital points out that Imagination tried, without much success, to sell off its best performing divisions -- before finally putting the whole company on sale today: It was never going to be easy for Imagination Technologies when it lost its biggest customer and efforts to offload two of its three main businesses \u2013 MIPS and Ensigma - in a bid to strengthen the balance sheet clearly weren\u2019t enough. These were both strong potential growth areas that could have delivered lasting revenue accretion to offset the loss of Apple. That was a pretty dire scenario, akin to selling off the family silver to keep the estate going a little longer. Now the shutters are up and a buyer sought. A pretty ignominious end to what was a great British tech success story.\u201d More here: The number of Americans signing on for unemployment benefit has inched up, but remains at historically low levels. Some 241,000 US citizens filed initial jobless claims last week, new figures show, up from 238,000 the previous week. Wall Street had expected a smaller rise, to 240,000; still, this is a level consistent with a solid labour market. The number of \u2018continuing jobless claims\u2019 also rose to 1.94 million, meaning than an extra 8,000 people remained on jobless benefits. That\u2019s also a relatively low figure: Newsflash from Wall Street: American Airlines has revealed that rival Qatar Airways is interested in buying a 10% stake. American Airlines says it recently received an \u201cunsolicited notice\u201d, saying Qatar Airways intends to make a significant investment in AA\u2019s common stock, bought on the open market. American Airlines\u2019 shares have jumped by 5%, and other airlines are rallying too.... After a wobbly morning, Brent crude has now risen back over the $45 per barrel level. It\u2019s now changing hands at around $45.17, up 0.6% compared with yesterday\u2019s seven-month low. But City analysts are still downbeat about oil. Barclays have just cut their 2017 forecast for Brent to $52 per barrel, down from $56. Howard Archer, chief economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club, suspects that the CBI may be over-egging the strength of UK manufacturing. Archer says it\u2019s \u201chighly encouraging\u201d to see total order books at their best level for nearly 29 years, but points out that official data have been more pessimistic. \u201cTaken at face value, the survey suggests that the manufacturing sector has had a strong second quarter and has considerable momentum going into the third quarter \u201cHowever, there is the concern that survey evidence for the manufacturing sector has tended to be markedly more upbeat than the official data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) so far in 2017. \u201cIndeed, official data suggests that the manufacturing sector is far from guaranteed to see even modest growth in the second quarter. Specifically, latest ONS figures show manufacturing output edged up 0.2% month-on-month in April after falling in each of the first three months of 2017. Consequently, manufacturing output was down by 0.7% in the three months to April compared to the three months to January. Philip Shaw of Investec is also cautious. He says today\u2019s report could bolster the case for an early UK interest rate hike - but points out that manufacturing only contributes a small portion of UK GDP. While it\u2019s reassuring to see some evidence of a strengthening of exports, one should remember that manufacturing still only accounts for about 10 percent of the economy.\u201d The Guardian\u2019s latest Brexit dashboard is out....and it\u2019s rather gloomier than the CBI\u2019s factory report. This month\u2019s dashboard shows how Britons are suffering a living standards squeeze, 12 months on from the EU referendum. My colleague Katie Allen explains: One year since voters narrowly opted for Brexit, the Guardian\u2019s monthly tracker of economic news paints a gloomy picture, with households facing rising costs and firms fretting over falling demand and political uncertainty. The economy has so far avoided the recession predicted by some doomsayers at the time of the referendum, and in the months immediately following the Brexit vote the UK outperformed most other advanced economies. But at the turn of the year the economy slowed markedly and the UK slipped to the bottom of the European growth league. It was also left trailing behind the world\u2019s advanced economies. As the pound\u2019s sharp drop since the referendum works its way through the economy into higher prices in the shops, the pressures on consumer spending threaten to keep growth in the doldrums. Now that complex Brexit talks are gettting under way, business groups are also warning of headwinds from fraught domestic politics and uncertainty around the UK\u2019s future trading and immigration arrangements. Here\u2019s the full story: Here are economists David Blanchflower and Andrew Sentance analysing the data: And here\u2019s the dashboard itself, tracking the key economic indicators: The CBI\u2019s survey also shows that UK factory order books have strengthened since the EU referendum a year ago: City experts are welcoming the news that UK factories are enjoying a blowout month. Here\u2019s Julian Jessop, chief economist at the Institute of Economic Affairs: Here\u2019s more reaction: Newsflash: Britain\u2019s manufacturing sector is enjoying its best month for new orders since the summer of 1988. That\u2019s according to the CBI\u2019s healthcheck on the sector, which found that factory order books have strengthened this month. Some 27% of manufacturers reported total order books to be above normal, and 12% said they were below normal, giving a rounded balance of +16% -- the highest in nearly three decades. The CBI explains: The survey of 464 manufacturers found that total order books climbed to the highest level since August 1988. This was underpinned by a broad-based improvement in 13 of the 17 sub-sectors, led by the food, drink &amp; tobacco and chemicals sectors. Export orders also improved to a 22-year high, hitting similar peaks to those seen in 2011 and 2013. A jump in orders suggests factories should be pretty busy in the next few months. Manufacturers are also quite upbeat about their prospects this year; 37% predicted growth, and 9% a decline, giving a rounded balance of +27% However, it\u2019s not all good news. First, factory output growth has slowed compared to earlier this year.... Secondly, many firms told the CBI that they intent to hike prices in the months ahead. That\u2019s because their raw materials costs have gone up (due to the weak pound). Rain Newton-Smith, CBI Chief Economist, says: \u201cBritain\u2019s manufacturers are continuing to see demand for \u201cMade in Britain\u201d goods rise with the temperature. Total and export order books are at highs not seen for decades, and output growth remains robust. \u201cNevertheless, with cost pressures remaining elevated it\u2019s no surprise to see that manufacturers continue to have high expectations for the prices they plan to charge. Greece\u2019s debt crisis has fallen out of the headlines again, after Athens\u2019 creditors agreed to hand over an \u20ac8.3bn loan tranche last week. That deal removed the immediate threat of a default this summer, but hasn\u2019t addressed the key issue; Greece\u2019s debt pile is unsustainably large, and Europe and the International Monetary Fund can\u2019t agree what to do about it. Mohamed A El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz, argues that Europe needs to soften its stance and consider how to give Greece the help it needs. He writes: For those of us who have been following the Greek economic tragedy for many years, much of the European view continues to defy economic logic \u2013 and for a simple reason: European politicians worry about the domestic political consequences of granting Greece debt relief, especially ahead of Germany\u2019s federal election in September. Offering debt relief, it is feared, could undermine the credibility of governing parties and provide a boost to extremist movements. To be sure, debt forgiveness is tricky, raising complicated issues of fairness and incentives. Yet, in some cases, there comes a time when refusal to forgive debt is more damaging. European officials know as well as the IMF does that Greece has long been at this stage, turning the country into a permanent \u201cward of the state\u201d within a eurozone that does not accommodate this outcome well. But they seem unable to act. Here\u2019s the full piece: Equities are down this morning because traders are worried that the falling oil price signals low inflation and weaker growth, says David Madden of CMC Markets. He says: European equities have fallen again as the weakness in oil is weighing on investor confidence. In London, the FTSE 100 is down 0.5% and commodity related companies are the biggest fallers. BP and Royal Dutch Shell are in the red on the back of falling oil prices. While, mining companies like Glencore, Anglo American and BHP Billiton are lower again as dealers are concerned about declining demand for commodities from Asia. Oil isn\u2019t the only commodity having a bad morning. Sugar and coffee are at their lowest in over a year, cocoa is close to a 10-year low, and wheat has also dropped. The Financial Times has the details: Cocoa in New York, has fallen almost 10 per cent since the start of this week, settling at $1,853 a tonne on Wednesday. Some traders are watching to see whether it tests $1,756, the 10-year low seen in April. Sugar is trading at 13 cents a pound, a 16-month low, while arabica coffee is at $1.2195 a pound, a level not seen since May last year. It\u2019s a worry for producers, and emerging markets that rely on exports of these \u2018soft commodities\u2019. But it could bring relief to consumers... IF suppliers pass these prices on. Even if they don\u2019t, there should be less pressure to raise prices or shrink products. Europe\u2019s economic recovery is on course and strengthening steadily, according to the European Central Bank. In its new economic bulletin, the ECB says the latest data suggest \u201csolid growth\u201d in the current quarter, thanks to rising demand at home and abroad. The ongoing economic expansion is increasingly resilient and has broadened across sectors and countries. Euro area growth is supported primarily by domestic demand, although tailwinds from the external environment have increasingly lent support to the outlook. The recovery is \u201cparticularly visible\u201d in euro area labour markets, it adds, with the unemployment rate falling to 9.3%, an eight-year low. The ECB also focuses on the oil price, saying that recent falls should have a dampening effect on inflation. It adds: Brent crude oil prices have fluctuated in the range of $48 to $56 per barrel since early March. The price fluctuations reflect shifting concerns among market participants about the likely success of the OPEC strategy to curtail production, amid still high oil inventories and rising US shale production. The prolongation of the output cut for nine months, which was agreed by OPEC and 11 non-OPEC countries on 25 May 2017, was widely anticipated by markets and priced in before the meeting. Hopes raised by some participating countries that there might be agreement on an even deeper or longer cut did not materialise, which led to a renewed price drop in the aftermath of the meeting of about 6% in US dollar terms. Looking ahead, the futures curve is signalling largely unchanged oil prices over the next three years. Non-oil commodity prices have declined by about 8% since early March. The oil price is a handy proxy for how confident investors feel about the global economy, as faster growth means more demand for energy. Chris Scicluna, head of economic research at Daiwa Capital Markets says: \u201cAs far as the market mentality is concerned, as long as the oil price keeps weakening, this is going to tell us something about the underlying capacity of the global economy to generate inflation on a sustained basis.\u201d Bloomberg\u2019s Tracy Alloway has spotted a trend in the oil price: European stock markets have all dipped into the red, as the oil price worries traders. In London the FTSE 100 is down 28 points, or 0.4%. Royal Dutch Shell, the oil company, has shed almost 1.5%. Mining companies are also down, mirroring a fall in commodity prices such as copper. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx blames the weak oil price: The oil slick only got thicker this Thursday, the markets drowning in a well of the black stuff. Brent Crude quickly hit a new 2017 nadir, and its worst price since November 2016, this morning, dropping another 0.2% to sit just below $45 per barrel. Despite a brief bounce following yesterday\u2019s larger than expected fall in US crude inventories the current oil glut fears aren\u2019t receding, especially since ramped up production in places like Libya and America means OPEC\u2019s ability to affect global output may be waning. Libya and Nigeria are also pushing the oil price down, says the Wall Street Journal\u2019s Georgi Kantchev. He writes: Oil production in conflict torn Libya, which is exempted from the OPEC output deal, has surprised on the upside. Despite the continued civil war in the country, which has Africa\u2019s largest oil reserves, Libyan output has recently climbed to 885,000 barrels a day, roughly three times its level from just a year ago. Nigeria, also exempted from the OPEC agreement due to militant attacks on its oil infrastructure, is another wild-card. Last month, its production rose to 1.68 million barrels a day, its highest level in a year, according to OPEC data. More here: Five Reasons Why Oil Is Falling Wayne McCurrie, fund manager at Ashburton Investments, argues that Brent crude has fallen to levels which are unprofitable for shale producers - possibly putting a floor under the oil price. The fall in the oil price is encouraging investors to bail out of risky assets, says FXTM chief market strategist Hussein Sayed. He adds: It\u2019s evident that oil prices are becoming the primary driver of the financial markets. After both benchmarks entered a bear market with Brent plunging below $45 for the first time since November, investors are becoming more concerned as to when the plunge will stop. Sayed believes that the market is losing faith in Opec: Comments from Iranian oil minister, Bijan Zangeneh that Iran is in discussions with OPEC members for further production cuts fell on deaf ears, meaning that comments from OPEC members are unlikely to influence prices. With no hard data to encourage bulls to jump in, the risk to the downside will continue to persist. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. There\u2019s an edgy feel in the markets this morning, after the oil price slumped deeper into a bear market last night. Brent crude is wallowing below $45 per barrel this morning, close to yesterday\u2019s seven-month low, as concerns over a supply glut and falling demand dominate. US crude oil has also tumbled, hitting its lowest levels since last summer. That helped to send energy stocks sliding on Wall Street yesterday. This chart from Bloomberg shows how the oil price has now slumped by 20% from its recent highs, putting it in bear market territory. The selloff is being driven by several factors, including: signs that the oil market is simply oversupplied, scepticism that Opec can actually enforce its production freeze deal, the reality that other producers - such as US shale oil drillers - will boost their own production if the price is right. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets says a surprise fall in US oil inventories yesterday hasn\u2019t given oil much support. Crude oil prices have taken another leg lower, falling to their lowest level since August overnight. The move comes as an un-named OPEC member casts doubt over the possibility of deeper production cuts by the group, offsetting a drop in US inventories. Also coming up today... There\u2019s a raft of data coming up, including the latest economic bulletin from the European Central Bank and a new health-check on Britain\u2019s factories. European stock markets have dropped in early trading and are expected to be subdued; perhaps City traders are too worn out by the heat....

McDonald\u2019s has finally answered your prayers\u2013 if you live in parts of London, Nottingham and Leeds at least. The fast food giant has launched its long-awaited \u201cMcDelivery\u201d trial in the UK after teaming up with Uber\u2019s food delivery service, UberEats. McDonald\u2019s will offer the service from 22 outlets across the capital and another 10 restaurants in Leeds and Nottingham \u2013 although customers will have to live within a 1.5 mile radius of a restaurant. Customers can place orders through the UberEats app between 7am and 2am. Claude Abi-Gerges, a McDonald\u2019s franchisee who has five London outlets taking part in the trial, said the service would offer a \u201cnew level of convenience\u201d to fit around customers\u2019 busy lives. McDonald\u2019s said it would be monitoring the trial closely to see whether it proved popular. Mathieu Proust, general manager of UberEats, said the trial would let people \u201cget the food they want\u201d quickly and reliably. The launch comes after KFC launched home deliveries from 30 outlets in greater London via the Just Eat platform earlier this year. Growth in the number of ready-to-eat food deliveries was stronger than that for the broader eating out market last year, according to analysts at NPD Group. The McDonald\u2019s move follows similar tie-ups with Uber in the US, while the chain already delivers in China and Singapore. Early last year the company said it would experiment with table service and cooked-to-order gourmet burgers at hundreds of UK restaurants, in a bid to head off competition from upmarket rivals such as Byron. In April McDonald\u2019s said quarterly profits rose by a better than expected 8% to $1.21bn, despite a 3.9% fall in revenue to $5.68bn. Operating costs dropped nearly 12%. Sales at US restaurants open for more than a year rose 1.7% in the three months to March 2017. The increase comes after the chief executive, Steve Easterbrook, who is British, launched a turnaround plan involving slashing overheads, weeding out underperforming restaurants, offering the breakfast menu all day and switching US restaurants to chicken raised without human antibiotics.",

The company behind Smirnoff, Johnnie Walker and Baileys announced it would buy Casamigos, created four years ago by the American actor, together with Cindy Crawford\u2019s husband Rande Gerber and property developer Mike Meldman. Diageo said it was the fastest-growing super-premium tequila brand in the US. The world\u2019s biggest spirits maker will pay $700m now and a further $300m based on performance over the next decade. The founders will continue to promote Casamigos, which is Spanish for \u201chouse of friends\u201d. The firm sold 120,000 9-litre cases last year, mainly in the US, and is expected to reach more than 170,000 this year. The tequila comes in three premium varieties, priced at $45-55 a bottle. \u201cIf you asked us four years ago if we had a $1bn company, I don\u2019t think we would have said yes,\u201d Clooney said in a statement. \u201cThis reflects Diageo\u2019s belief in our company and our belief in Diageo. But we\u2019re not going anywhere. We\u2019ll still be very much a part of Casamigos. Starting with a shot tonight. Maybe two.\u201d The trio \u2013 who own neighbouring homes in Los Cabos in Mexico \u2013 spent more than five years tasting and developing the tequila brand with a master distiller in the Jalisco highlands of Mexico, according to Clooney. Gerber, a former model, said: \u201cWhat started from a friendship and an idea to create the best tasting, smoothest tequila as our own house tequila to drink and share with friends, has quickly turned into the fastest-growing super-premium tequila. Casamigos has always been brought to you by those who drink it and we look forward to continuing that, working alongside the expertise and global reach of Diageo.\u201d Diageo\u2019s chief executive, Ivan Menezes, said the company planned to take Casamigos beyond the US and Caribbean to Europe and other markets \u201cto capitalise on the significant international potential of the brand\u201d. Casamigos will sit alongside Don Julio tequila in Diageo\u2019s vast drinks portfolio. It snapped up Don Julio, which sells from $43 a bottle, in 2014 from Casa Cuervo in return for giving the Mexican firm its Bushmills Irish whiskey brand. Diageo also owns the DeL\u00e9on and Peligroso tequila brands. The emergence of premium tequilas has helped the drink shake off its traditional image as a party beverage for young drinkers. Global tequila sales rose by 5.2% last year, compared with just 0.3% growth for the spirits industry as a whole, according to data tracker IWSR.",

      "bodyText": "Further boardroom upheaval is under way at Burberry after the luxury fashion brand revealed its long-standing chairman, Sir John Peace, is planning to leave. Peace has been chair of the FTSE 100 company since it was spun out of GUS in 2002, and has signalled his departure as the new chief executive prepares to take the helm. Marco Gobbetti will become chief executive next month after being recruited from French luxury rival C\u00e9line. His appointment is one of a number of senior management changes at the company, which recently hired Julie Brown from the medical supplies group Smith &amp; Nephew as chief operating officer and chief financial officer. Once Gobbetti takes over, Christopher Bailey, who had been combining the role of chief executive and chief creative officer, will become president of the business, renowned for its trenchcoats and distinctive check patterns. It not clear whether the departure of 68-year-old Peace from Burberry will mark the end of a long career in the boardrooms of some of the UK\u2019s biggest companies. At one point, he chaired three FTSE 100 businesses \u2013 Burberry, the credit-checking company Experian and Standard Chartered bank. At Burberry, he was forced to defend the decision to combine Bailey\u2019s role as chief creative designer with chief executive after Angela Ahrendts quit to run Apple\u2019s retail operations in 2013. He also had to defend the pay arrangements after a bruising annual general meeting in 2014 when 52.7% of investors rebelled against Bailey\u2019s pay deal. The announcement that preparations for his replacement are under way comes before next month\u2019s AGM. This year, the company has attempted to appease investor anger by reducing overall pay deals. The search for Peace\u2019s successor will be led by Jeremy Darroch, the chief executive of Sky who on Wednesday was named as senior independent director (SID) of Burberry. In a stock market announcement, Burberry said Darroch was taking over the crucial non-executive role from Phillip Bowman, who is leaving the board in October after joining in 2002. \u201cIt will be the responsibility of Jeremy Darroch as the newly appointed SID to lead the process of appointing a successor to Sir John Peace. It is anticipated that a successor will be announced by the end of 2018,\u201d Burberry said. Peace had a particularly bruising year in 2014; he left the board of Experian and ran into a corporate governance row when he was replaced by the chief executive, usually frowned upon by investors. As well as the revolt over pay at Burberry, there was another at Standard Chartered. He left there last year, after a tumultuous period during which the chief executive and four other directors all left the troubled emerging markets-focused bank. Knighted in 2011 for services to business and the voluntary sector, Peace made his name at GUS, once known as Great Universal Stores, where he helped set up Experian before becoming chief executive in 2000. He spun off Burberry in 2002 and Experian in 2006.",

      "bodyText": "The lack of wage growth in Britain\u2019s economy is the result of turning the clock back to the days before the Industrial Revolution when there were no trade unions and self-employment was rife, the chief economist of the Bank of England has suggested. Andy Haldane said the current relationship between pay and employment had more in common with the period between 1500 and 1750 than in the subsequent period, because in the post-1750 era, collective bargaining and the expansion of full-time paid employment meant workers were able to secure generous pay awards when labour was scarce. \u201cThe move towards greater self-employment and less unionisation is, in some respects, a shift back to the future in the nature of work,\u201d Haldane said, harking back to the days before James Watt, a key figure in the emergence of the steam engine, and other pioneers began the transformation of Britain\u2019s largely agrarian economy. \u201cPrior to the Industrial Revolution, and indeed for some years after it, most workers were self-employed or worked in small businesses. There were no unions. Hours were flexible, depending on what work was needed to collect the crops, milk the cows or put bread on the table. Work was artisanal, task-based, divisible.\u201d Haldane, whose speech revealed differences with the Bank\u2019s governor, Mark Carney, over interest rates, said the read-across from pre-industrial Britain to the 21st century was not exact but that there were parallels with today\u2019s gig economy. He added that there was evidence that changes in the nature of work had been a factor in explaining why wage growth was running at just 2% at a time when unemployment was the lowest since the mid-1970s. The chief economist said a period of \u201cdivide and conquer\u201d had left workers less able to bargain for higher wages. \u201cThere is power in numbers. A workforce that is more easily divided than in the past may find itself more easily conquered. In other words, a world of divisible work may reduce workers\u2019 wage-bargaining power.\u201d Trade union membership has declined from 38% of employees in 1990 to 23% in 2016, and Haldane noted that the downward trend was likely to continue. \u201cThe fact that unionisation rates have been falling within each age cohort over time, and are lowest among the young, suggests the downward trend in rates of unionisation may still have some distance to travel. \u201cFor example, if unionisation rates were to continue to decline at the same average rate as over the past decade, then they are likely to fall to around 10% of employees, or 3 million people, within a generation.\u201d Self-employment had increased from 8% of the workforce in 1980 to almost 15%, or about 4.25 million people. Only one in six of the self-employed hired other workers compared with 30% in 1990. The number of people on zero-hours contracts had increased from 170,000 (0.6% of those in employment) in 2010 to almost 1 million workers (3% of employees) by 2016. At the current rate of expansion, employees on zero-hour contracts would reach about 7% within a decade. Haldane said: \u201cGigging can be fun for some. But not everyone wants to be a roadie when it comes to the world of work.\u201d",

In other words, a world of divisible work may reduce workers\u2019 wage-bargaining power.\u201d</p> <p>Trade union membership has declined from 38% of employees in 1990 to 23% in 2016, and Haldane noted that the downward trend was likely to continue.</p> <p>\u201cThe fact that unionisation rates have been falling within each age cohort over time, and are lowest among the young, suggests the downward trend in rates of unionisation may still have some distance to travel.</p> <p>\u201cFor example, if unionisation rates were to continue to decline at the same average rate as over the past decade, then they are likely to fall to around 10% of employees, or 3 million people, within a generation.\u201d<br></p> <p>Self-employment had increased from 8% of the workforce in 1980 to almost 15%, or about 4.25 million people. Only one in six of the self-employed hired other workers compared with 30% in 1990. The number of people on zero-hours contracts had increased from 170,000 (0.6% of those in employment) in 2010 to almost 1 million workers (3% of employees) by 2016. At the current rate of expansion, employees on zero-hour contracts would reach about 7% within a decade.</p> <p>Haldane said: \u201cGigging can be fun for some. But not everyone wants to be a roadie when it comes to the world of work.\u201d <br></p>",
