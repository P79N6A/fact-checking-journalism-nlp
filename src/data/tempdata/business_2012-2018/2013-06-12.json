    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The chief executive of Royal Bank of Scotland, Stephen Hester, was forced out of his job on Wednesday with a payoff at least \u00a31.6m \u2013 and possibly up to \u00a35.6m \u2013 as the bailed-out bank started preparations for privatisation next year. Hester, parachuted in to take charge of the near-bankrupt RBS during the 2008 banking crisis, admitted it was the \"board's decision\" that he should go. Last month he said he was ready to see through his \"mission\" to return RBS to the private sector after its \u00a345bn taxpayer bailout. George Osborne, the chancellor, backed the RBS board's decision to introduce a new face at the helm of the 81% taxpayer-owned bank. But Treasury sources dampened expectations that the government would fire the starting gun on selling shares in the bank in the very near future. The surprise announcement of Hester's departure came after the stock market had closed. It then emerged that Osborne met the bank's chairman, Sir Philip Hampton, last week to discuss the succession planning being undertaken by the bank, which is aiming for privatisation by the end of 2014. Osborne has never commented on the timetable for a share selloff. Describing the role he has held since October 2008 as \"bruising and difficult\" Hester said: \"It is a sensible thing for the board to look forward to privatisation and I can completely understand that a fresh face with an ability to commit many years into the future may be a good thing for privatisation.\" The 52 year-old, who has described running RBS as a \"soap opera\", was recruited during the depths of the 2008 banking crisis. He replaced Fred Goodwin as the bank attempted to shore up its finances after the disastrous takeover of ABN Amro left the bank on the brink of collapse. He has cut 39,000 RBS jobs \u2013 another 2,000 job losses are expected to be announced this morning \u2013 and reduced the size of the bank's balance sheet by \u00a31tn, an amount equal to about two-thirds of the UK's annual GDP. The bank also reported a record-breaking annual loss of \u00a324bn. Hester will receive \u00a31.6m in pay and benefits when he departs and up to \u00a34m in awards of long-term incentive plans over the following three years. The package may provoke a furore, as payments to Hester have done in the past. He has been forced to waive his annual bonuses every year except 2010 since he has been running the bank. Dominic Hook, national officer of Unite, said: \"With over 30,000 job losses over the last five years and major stress for RBS staff there is likely to be a lot of anger over Stephen Hester's taxpayer-funded multimillion pound exit package.\" The departing chief executive told Channel 4 News that the arguments over bankers' pay would go on for years. \"Of course wrangles about bankers' pay are not going to stop with me \u2026 other people can carry on that baton,\" he said. The bank said he was contractually entitled to the \u00a31.6m, that he would not get a bonus for 2013 \u2013 the year RBS was fined \u00a3390m for rigging Libor \u2013 and still had 2m shares locked up in long-term incentive plans. The number of shares that can be released is capped at 65% \u2013 \u00a34m at the current share price. Hester and Hampton have been saying since February that the bank could be privatised next year, when a five-year restructuring programme will be complete. \"While leading that process would be the end of an incredible chapter for me, ideally for the company it should be led by someone at the beginning of their journey. I will therefore step down at the end of this year to allow a new CEO to lead the group in this next stage,\" Hester said. \"I'm co-operating amicably. It is a board decision, not mine, but I am completely comfortable with the rationale behind it,\" he said, adding that he had \"some human regrets\" about not seeing through the privatisation. \"I have been pretty clear that I suppose I feel torn about this. I feel a sense of loyalty to the company and I want to do what is right for the company.\" In 2012 he admitted he considered resigning in the row over his bonus payment. But in recent months he had been indicating that he wanted to see the bank through to privatisation and sources believed he would stay on for another two years to see through the process.Hampton said the board wanted Hester to make a commitment to stay for another four years. The chairman, who was part of the clean-up team put into RBS after the \u00a345bn taxpayer bailout, said he thought the selloff of the taxpayer stake could be ready towards the end of 2014. \"If you work back from that date a new chief executive should in place for at least nine months, from early 2014,\" said Hampton. Hester's achievements had been \"considerable\", he said, and Osborne said Hester had made \"an important contribution to Britain's recovery from the financial crisis\". Osborne is preparing to use his Mansion House speech next week to say more about reform of the banking system and respond to the report by the parliamentary commission on banking, which may not be published until next week. Treasury sources were playing down expectations that the chancellor would spell out a timetable for the privatisation of RBS next week although a selloff of part of Lloyds Banking Group, in which the taxpayer owns a 39% stake, could come first. Osborne said: \"Having brought RBS back from the brink, now is the time to move on from the rescue phase to focus on RBS being a UK bank that provides greater support to the British economy, helping businesses and job creation here, and which can return to the private sector in a way that ensures value for the taxpayer.\"",

Goodbye.That, roughly speaking, was the official explanation for Stephen Hester's exit from Royal Bank of Scotland. Brutal? Yes.

He is a long way from fitting the caricature of a fat-cat banker. There have been glaring faults under his tenure \u2013 last year's IT catastrophe and a failure to identify Libor-rigging earlier, for example.

Osborne and the cabinet (or, at least, most members of it) may desperately desire a rapid sale but there are several hurdles to clear yet. A fresh blow-up in the eurozone, for example, would squash investors' appetite for shares in banks. And another eurozone crisis in 2014 is far from being an outrageous idea. RBS may now find itself with a novice chief executive at a moment it could use an experienced hand. Jettisoning Hester while there are still \u00a340bn of rotten assets in the bank, which is RBS' estimate for the end of this year, could backfire. Second, do potential new shareholders in RBS really require the chief executive to sign up for a half a decade's service? Probably not.

He stressed that the ONS had already announced a review of public finance statistics, which will consider the question of how the QE proceeds will be treated, and is due to report in the autumn. A spokesman for the Statistics Authority said: \"We have asked the ONS to take account of our findings, so we'll be taking a close interest as the review progresses.\"",

It is true that every time the government changed, managers and top journalists were appointed to pursue the new political agenda.

Most of the workforce is here. There's been a call for a huge public gathering at 6 o'clock [4pm BST, or now], when there'll be music and speeches. It's tremendously important that people come--both political leaders made it clear that the government has been shaken by the public response.</p> <p>Many of us haven't slept for 48 hours, but we won't give in. We are sustained by the huge response we've had from citizens, not only here but at local radio stations all over the country.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Zigou</strong>&#xa0;said she believes that the decree to close the station may be a bid by Samaras to bring about early elections as New Democracy has been doing well in the polls. It is also a quick way of fulfilling the troika's demands that the public sector payroll by shrunk by 2,000 by the end of the summer.&#xa0;</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There have been people in tears at local radio stations in border regions--in Crete, in Samos, in Thrace. In those areas, ERT was the only Greek language radio you could hear, and the signals of other TV stations are weak too. Without ERT they feel cut off from the metropolis. But it's much more than that, more than the firing of 2,600 workers. The sudden, undemocratic closure of a public broadcaster was a kind of coup. This isn't a private station that someone can just decided to close. This doesn't happen in democratic countries.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Zigou</strong> added:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We need solidarity from around the world, not just from fellow journalists and unions but from ordinary citizens.

It\u2019s true that Samaras has stolen a march on his coalition partners, forcing them to put up or shut up in the government\u2019s bid to meet troika targets. But is this the best way to ensure the coalition remains intact and functioning? It\u2019s also true that Samaras\u2019s move shoves SYRIZA center stage, where it will have to show if it possesses the wherewithal to harness whatever anger is created by ERT\u2019s closure. But is it really wise to stoke the forces of protest and resistance when they appear to have abated?</p> <p>It\u2019s likely that there are Greeks who will interpret shutting down ERT as an indication that the government is willing to confront its challenges head-on. There are others, though, who will feel uncomfortable, even angered, by riot police standing in front of the country\u2019s public broadcaster \u2013 imagery that conjures up painful memories in a country that lived through a dictatorship in the not-too-distant past.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://insidegreece.wordpress.com/2013/06/12/ert-off-air-thought-for-the-day/\">Here's Nick's full piece: ERT off air: Thought for the&#xa0;day</a></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-51b82f43e4b0f749db72ae5e\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-06-12T08:20:19.632Z\">9.20am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Photos: protests and late shifts</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>These photos show ERT workers kept the station running overnight, while large crowds gathered outside:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-38942669-eb61-47ed-88af-ca8041ea7281\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/6/12/1371023508878/8a48c082-9faa-4874-bd68-e7e6e45c5a12-460x307.jpeg\" alt=\"epa03740784 People gather outside of the Greek state television (ERT) station's headquarters in Agia Paraskevi after the government announced ERT's closure as of 11 June 2013 night, in Athens, Greece, 12 June 2013.\" width=\"460\" height=\"307\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Last night, people gathered outside of the Greek state television (ERT) station's headquarters in Agia Paraskevi.

      "bodyText": "Time to wrap the live blog up, after quite a lively day. Coverage of the resignation of Stephen Hester from Royal Bank of Scotland begins at 5.25pm. While our coverage of the crisis in Greece after staff at state broadcaster ERT defied attempts to shut them down begins at 8.26am and runs through the day. I'l be back tomorrow -- until then, thanks, and goodnight. Stephen Hester has also given an interview to ITV News, which will be broadcast on News at 10. Producer Jess Brammar has tweeted some of the highlights: City analysts at Bernstein Research reckon that Stephen Hester's departure is good news for RBS: They told clients: We believe the move will actually be positive for the bank and the stock. The UK Government (the perfect insider) wouldn't have let Hester go if there was still derisking to be done in the bank \u2013 especially given the fact that he was absolutely key in turning around the bank and that too over a prolonged period of more than five years and under extreme political duress. That's via Fast FT Speaking on Channel 4 News tonight, Stephen Hester said that \"one of the good things\" about leaving RBS was that journalists would no longer be able to ask him questions about his salary and benefits. Of course, wrangles about bankers' pay are not gong to stop with me and other people can carry on that baton. I think if you look at that commercial world, people may or may not like the commercial world, but if you look at it and what we have accomplished at RBS, the size of the job, the challenges and the successes and look at what I have been paid for it, it would be low in a commercial sense. It would be high in a societal sense and so this is an argument that will go in circles for years to come I'm sure. Hester's time at RBS was punctuated by rows over his remuneration package. In January 2012 he waived a bonus worth almost \u00a31m after a political outcry, and then voluntarily did without another after IT problems at Natwest. Business secretary Vince Cable gave a rather muted reaction to the news that Stephen Hester was off: He performed a necessary role at a difficult time. Going forward, RBS needs more of a focus on SME lending and supporting the economy. While Lord Oakeshott, the former Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman, said: Stephen Hester steadied the ship but it's still full steam astern on business lending. The Treasury must install a successor to get desperately needed loans out to small business for investment and jobs, not flog the shares off for a song (via the Daily Telegraph) If Stephen Hester really decided to amicably resign, rather than being fired, why is he getting a \u00a31.6m payoff, Jeff Randall asks Sir Philip Hampton. Hampton replies that this a contractual obligation, adding that Hester's contract was rather unsual in that regard -- having been agreed in the 'particular circumstances' of the height of the financial crisis five years ago. RBS doesn't have a successor in mind for Stephen Hester, Hampton says. This is an orderly change, he insists. Hampton also said Hester's departure will help RBS move down the path towards privatisastion. He has done a fine job, but \"now is absolutely the right time to find a successor.\" RBS chairman Sir Philip Hampton is defending the news that Stephen Hester is leaving the bank, on Sky News tonight. Asked whether George Osborne pushed for Hester to go, Hampton explains that the decision stems from the desire of the Treasury to return RBS to private hands. The bank is 81% owned by the taxpayer, he points out, so when the government told him that they want to start the privatisation process, the board (which also supports that plan) recognised that a new CEO would be needed to handle that process, and the years afterwards. If Stephen had arrived a few years ago, he would have been absolutely the right person...Can he really commit to another 3 or 4 years in 18 month's time? Sky News also reckons that RBS will announce another 2,000 job cuts at its investment banking division tomorrow morning. Chancellor George Osborne praised Stephen Hester for his work at the bank since 2008, but argued that it's now time to move \"from that rescue phase to a new phase\", giving more support to the UK economy. That will only add to speculation that the Treasury played a role in Hester's departure. Here's the video clip issued by Royal Bank of Scotland, of Stephen Hester explaining that he feels 'proud' about his time at RBS, and would have liked to stay and finish the job. Nathan Bostock, RBS's new finance director (he's currently running its restructuring operations), has emerged as the front-runner to replace Stephen Hester as the bank's chief executive. Here's the latest odds from Ladbrokes tonight: Nathan Bostock 1/2 Richard Meddings 4/1 Rory Cullinan 4/1 Cameron Clyne 6/1 Ellen Alemany 10/1 Chris Sullivan 10/1 Bruce van Saun 14/1 Ross McEwan 20/1 Mark Catton 25/1 Rory Tapner 25/1 Jim Brown 33/1 Ron Teerlink 33/1 Sunil Lamlani 33/1 Rich Ricci 100/1 Bob Diamond 250/1 Sir Mervyn King 500/1 Please don't waste your money on the last three options... Back to the big story in the UK, tonight, the suprise departure of RBS chief executive Stephen Hester (highlights from 5.25pm, interspersed with our coverage of the Greek crisis - sorry for any confusion). Conservative MP David Ruffley hinted tonight that Hester's departure may have been spurred by government pressure to return Royal Bank of Scotland to private ownership through a share giveaway. Ruffley told Sky News: Politics has interfered in what should have been a pretty simply business decision. He added that it looked like \"more than coincidence\" that Hester was off at a time when politicians had their \"sticky little paws\" over the future of RBS. And as flagged up at 6.26pm, Hester is pretty clear that his departure is the RBS's board's decision, not his.... Evangelos Venizelos, leader of the Greek Pasok party, has called on prime minister Antonis Samaras to hold a meeting over the future of ERT. Speaking after holding talks with Democratic Left leader Fotis Kouvelis this evening, Venizelos said the three party leaders should \"discuss responsibly\" how to resolve the situation. He added that he hoped the message was \"understood\" by all parties. RBS just held a conference call to discuss the parting-of-the-ways with CEO Stephen Hester. Hester pinned the decision firmly on the bank's board, while chairman Sir Phillip Hampton was cagey when asked about the government's role. Jill Treanor reports: While the Telegraph's Harry WIlson wonders when Hester learned he was off: And The Economist's banking editor, Jonathan Rosenthal, showed sympathy for Hester: And here's another photo from the protest outside Greeece's embassy in London: The shock departure of Stephen Hester from RBS tonight comes as the bank, majority owned by the UK taxpayer, prepares for privatisation: My colleague Jill Treanor writes: Hester's resignation comes amid speculation that the chancellor will use next week's Mansion House speech to signal a privatisation plan for both RBS and Lloyds Banking Group. Osborne said Hester had \"made an important contribution to Britain's recovery from the financial crisis\". \"Having brought RBS back from the brink, now is the time to move on from the rescue phase to focus on RBS being a UK bank that provides greater support to the British economy, helping businesses and job creation here, and which can return to the private sector in a way that ensures value for the taxpayer,\" Osborne said, confirming he would use the Mansion House speech to say more \"on reform of the banking system\". And here's Jill's full story on Hester's exit - RBS chief executive Stephen Hester quits with \u00a31.6m-plus payoff. Our latest news story about today's developments in Greece, by my colleague Lisa O'Carroll, is now live: ERT shutdown: Greek government reveals plans for new state broadcaster It begins: The Greek government has unveiled plans to open a slimmed down version of the state broadcaster just hours after taking the draconian step of shutting ERT down with the immediate loss of 2,700 jobs. As ERT journalists continued to defy the shutdown on Wednesday with a live web feed from the occupied studios at the broadcaster's headquarters in Athens, draft legislation was unveiled to launch a replacement service, but not until the end of August. Simos Kedikoglou, a government spokesman, said the proposed slimmed down state broadcaster would run on just 1,200 employees. \"We tried during the past year to find a way of overhauling public television but it wasn't possible to change anything,\" Kedigolou added. The protest outside the Greek embassy in London against the closure of ERT is underway. My colleague Dawn Foster is there: Surprising banking news in the UK: Royal Bank of Scotland just announced that its chief executive, Stephen Hester, is leaving the bank by the end of the year. The official statement is online here -- explaining he'll leave with a \u00a31.6m cash payoff (plus various unvested share awards that could be worth up to \u00a34m). Full story to follow. Tomorrow's general strike, which was called in solidarity with ERT's workers, will cause disruption to transport services. Kathimerini has the details: Intercity trains will not be running on Thursday, while certain evening services will also be cancelled on Wednesday, as Greek railway workers participate in a 24-hour strike called by the country\u2019s main public and private unions, GSEE and ADEDY. Services on the suburban railway known as Proastiakos will also be halted during the strike organized following the government's decision to close down public broadcaster ERT. The Athens metro and the Kifissia-Piraeus electric railway (ISAP) will operate from 9 a.m. onwards. Blue buses and trolley will halt services throughout the day. Air traffic controllers will walk off the job from 3 p.m. to 5 p.m. on Thursday. Amid the anger over the way ERT was summarily closed, many readers have told us that the broadcaster had plenty of flaws. The same problems are repeatedly mentioned \u2013 including pro-government political bias, and an unnecessary large payroll. Greek TV and radio is not my specialism, so I checked with our Greek correspondent, Helena Smith. She confirms that ERT had a somewhat grubby reputation: Like many public sector bodies, it was profligate and seen \u2013 not least by Greece's Troika of creditors \u2013 to be the embodiment of a bloated, unmeritocratic and ultimately corrupt public body. However, although far from reaching the BBC's levels, it was also said to be the best medium in a world where private television that focuses on cheap news and entertainment has mushroomed in the last decade in Greece. For Greeks living outside the country in places such as Australia, ERT's satellite news station was a mainstay of keeping in touch with Greece's debt crisis, and its government's actions. Since the eruption of Greece's debt crisis successive government have been under pressure to streamline an organisation that had also been accused of being vastly overstaffed. Writing on Comment is Free, Costas Douzinas said ERT was \"flawed but vital\", and a Poor Man's BBC: The government announcement said that the broadcaster suffers from a \"unique lack of transparency and incredible waste\". It is true that every time the government changed, managers and top journalists were appointed to pursue the new political agenda. But the blame lies squarely with the ruling New Democracy and Pasok parties, which ran the country like a private fiefdom for 40 years. It was their cronies and clients who inflated ERT's workforce. Greek citizens, and those with real experience of the country's TV, agree: And in the comments below, Sovjohn has been arguing in favour of a radical reshaping of ERT, but not in the drastic way that the Greek goevrnment chose. Siren45, though, argued that its local radio stations played an important role -- and applauded its TV arm for bringing British TV to Greece (including Downton Abbey and Call the Midwife are mentioned in dispatches) While another loyal reader, Kizbot, summed up the consequences: While I agree it could probably do with reorganising.. It is still the only thing Greece has that's even close to independent and proper journalism. Now this country HAS NONE AT ALL! Esewhere, Yiannis Baboulias called ERT's closure \"a direct attack on democracy\". Writing in the New Statesman, he too cited the company's reputation for cronyism: ERT has long been used by government ministers and MPs as a way to take care of their own. Most recently, the case of Anthi Salagkoudi made it to the pages of the German news magazine Der Speigel as a striking case of nepotism, in which the daughter of the former minister George Salagkoudis was hired as a presenter with a salary of \u20ac3,500, only for the channel to find out she wasn\u2019t suitable for the position. Despite that \"disadvantage\", Salagkoudi was moved around the channel until a suitable job was found for her. And politics lecturer Chris Hanretry has blogged about how ERT only looked good compared to the rest of the Greek media. He described it as one of Europe's \"least watched and least independent public broadcasters\" For a public broadcaster, ERT has an extremely low audience share (circa 12%). One of the reasons ERT performs so poorly is that it has been colonised by the political parties. Pasok leader Evangelos Venizelos has repeated his call for the Greek cabinet to meet and discuss the closure of ERT, following a meeting with his parliamentary colleagues. Venizelos told reporters that Pasok did not want fresh elections, but did not fear the thought of a return to the ballot box. To Vima has more details (in Greek) -- including that Venizelos said Pasok wanted to guarantee political stability in Greece, but was also committed to democracy. Venizelos then headed off for talks with Democratic Left leader Fotis Kouvelis on the issue. We've just spoken to a journalist inside ERT's radio HQ. Anastasia Zigou, who is a member of Strike Struggle, a group formed by ERT journalists in Nov 2011 said: There are many, many people inside the building now, and many more outside in the yard. Most of the workforce is here. There's been a call for a huge public gathering at 6 o'clock [4pm BST, or now], when there'll be music and speeches. It's tremendously important that people come--both political leaders made it clear that the government has been shaken by the public response. Many of us haven't slept for 48 hours, but we won't give in. We are sustained by the huge response we've had from citizens, not only here but at local radio stations all over the country. Zigou said she believes that the decree to close the station may be a bid by Samaras to bring about early elections as New Democracy has been doing well in the polls. It is also a quick way of fulfilling the troika's demands that the public sector payroll by shrunk by 2,000 by the end of the summer. There have been people in tears at local radio stations in border regions--in Crete, in Samos, in Thrace. In those areas, ERT was the only Greek language radio you could hear, and the signals of other TV stations are weak too. Without ERT they feel cut off from the metropolis. But it's much more than that, more than the firing of 2,600 workers. The sudden, undemocratic closure of a public broadcaster was a kind of coup. This isn't a private station that someone can just decided to close. This doesn't happen in democratic countries. Zigou added: We need solidarity from around the world, not just from fellow journalists and unions but from ordinary citizens. This matters to everyone. The sit-in at ERT continues, while the crowd of people outside its HQ is swelling. The two leaders of the junior parties in the Greek government, Pasok's Evangelos Venizelos and Fotis Kouvelis of Democratic Left, had been due to hold talks this afternoon about the shutdown. In the financial markets, shares are falling in late trading after a quiet day. The FTSE 100 is now down 30 points, or 0.5%, at 6311. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets explained that therr was some City chatter that the Greek government might call a confidence vote has alarmed some traders (I've heard nothing official on this, though) A pan-European body representing broadcasting technicians and creatives has condemned Greece's move to shut down the state broadcaster. In a statement, the UNI MEI Global Union said: the decision will deprive citizens of a vital pillar of democracy. It will punish a dedicated, passionate and skilled workforce that has made sacrifices over the past years to modernise ERT and meet the financial challenges. Opposition leader Alexis Tsipras made a statement after his meeting with the president, calling the decision an \"institutional coup\" and saying \"we are all obliged to resist it.\" He asked President Papoulias to intervene and initiate a debate in parliament within the next few hours... Here's a video clip from inside the ERT HQ, shot around an hour ago: That's via RadioBubble's excellent coverage of the situation in Greece today: The shutdown of ERT - Live blog 12 June 2013. Incidentally, there was a rumour floating around that Greek riot police might have moved in on the ERT offices, but we've been checking with a few people on the scene and it appears that this is not true. Greece's government is refusing to back down in the face of public anger today. Prime minister Antonis Samaras is sticking to his guns, insisting this afteroon that replacing ERT with a new broadcaster was in the public interest: Samaras called it a \"very temporary move\", adding: We decided to shut ERT temporarily and to create a new public broadcaster... we are protecting the public interest. His junior coalition partners, Pasok and Democratic Left, continue to oppose the move \u2013 Pasok has also revealed that the prospect of ERT being closed first emerged over the weekend. Kathimerini explains: Pasok issued a statement saying that Samaras had raised the possibility of closing down ERT during a meeting with Kouvelis and Venizelos on Sunday. Samaras, PASOK, claimed said this was the only way Greece would meet its commitment to the troika to fire 2,000 civil servants this summer so it could qualify for more bailout loans. Britain's National Union of Journalists has also condemned the decision to close the Hellenic Broadcasting Corp (ERT): Michelle Stanistreet, NUJ general secretary, said: This is a terrible decision. It is a direct assault on democracy at a time when the people of Greece need to be told what is going on. They need a reliable news source at this desperate time for the country, the economic situation and rise of dangerous far-right groups. The NUJ sends its support and solidarity to all the journalists who have been treated in this disgraceful way and we will be working with the IFJ to put pressure on the government to reverse its decision. The BBC's editorial director Roger Mosey, who is on the board of the European Broadcasting Union, has voiced his worries over the situation in Greece. Mosey told my colleague Lisa O'Carroll: We're watching events in Greece with great concern. When countries are in difficulty, there's an even bigger need for public service broadcasting and for independent, impartial news coverage. I hope that's restored in Greece as soon as possible. As we explained at 12.10pm, a satellite news gathering operation supplied by the EBU has been set up at the ERT's carpark, allowing them to keep broadcasting. Another photo from outside the HQ, via the always invaluable Theodora Oikonomides, showing the crowd is swelling as more people turn up to protest: New photos from Athens have arrived, including one picture of a placard inside ERT's HQ in Greek that reads \"the revolution will not be televised\". And here's two shots of protesters outside the building: To be clear, the Greek government's position is that the state broadcaster is not been dismantled for ever. It says that a successor, called New Hellenic Radio Internet and Television (or NERIT), will be set up by the end of August (more details here). However... The European Commission did not seek the closure of Greece's ERT national broadcaster as part of budget cuts, European Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn insisted earlier today. Speaking at European Parliament in Strasbourg, following the sudden decision to shut the Hellenic public TV and radio services, Rehn said: The Commission has not sought the closure of ERT, but nor does the Commission question the Greek government's mandate to manage the public sector. The decision of the Greek authorities should be seen in the context of the major and necessary efforts that the authorities are taking to modernize the Greek economy. Those include improving its efficiency and effectiveness of the public sector. That followed this morning's statement (see 11.24am). The European Confereration of Independent Trade Unions isn't impressed... Protests are being organised at various Greek embassies in Europe this afternoon. In London, a demonstration is being organised for 5pm at Greece's Holland Park site. Here's the Facebook invite: It reads: Hello to all the Greeks and our friends out there! It is of extreme importance for this effort to attract PUBLICITY in order to actually succeed something and effectively expose the lunatic action taken by the Greek government. So, what we absolutely NEED right now is people to know about this. Please, anyone who knows people from channels or newspapers contact them to come to the Greek embassy at 5 p.m. If we want to help Greece and its people, we need to show Britain firstly, and the world secondly, the absurdities that have taken place. Please, DO HELP. It appears that a protest has already taken place in Brussels: Greece's two largest labor unions called a 24-hour general strike earlier today for Thursday, in protest at the government's decision to close the Hellenic Broadcaasting Corporation. The general secretary of public sector union ADEDY, Ilias Iliopoulos, told Reuters: We want to show our solidarity to the state TV workers and protest against these unacceptable public sector reforms that the lenders have demanded. According to the Associated Press, a series of protests will take placeoutside the ERT headquarters tomorrow. The larger GSEE union was also meeting to ratify a decision to join the strike action. As reported this morning, journalist unions had already called walkouts for today and tomorrow. The European Broadcasting Union dramatically stepped in to help Greek TV journalists keep the state broadcaster on air after the government announced last night it was closing it down with immediate effect. A number of staff have defied government orders and camped overnight in the broadcaster\u2019s headquarters and have managed to continue broadcasting a makeshift schedule of news and talk shows via the internet (such as here) My colleague Lisa O'Carroll explains: The EBU, which is a body representing all of Europe\u2019s public service broadcasters, has put a satellite news gathering operation in the carpark where a number of journalists are also operating using equipment that has yet to be confiscated. This is being broadcast on one of their satellite transponders across Europe as part of its European news exchange operation. A spokesman for the organisation, which is headquartered in Geneva, said an emergency conference between members was scheduled for later today, to step on next steps. The director general of Hellenic Broadcasting Corp, or ERT, would be involved as would the BBC\u2019s editorial director Roger Mosey, who is on the EBU board. He said ERT staff in contact with the EBU have told them the power has not yet been cut by the government, but email servers have already been taken down. They are now contacting the EBU through smart phones on Facebook and private email. Lisa adds that there are also fears that the police will move in on the Athens headquarters later today to forcibly remove the journalists who have refused to leave the building and to confiscate cameras and other broadcasting equipment in the makeshift studio outside. Megan Greene, chief economist at Maverick Intelligence, tells me the ERT closure looks \"entirely politically motivated\". She suspects Samaras has \"underestimated how big a backlash\" the move will create. On that note, there are reports from Greece that senior members of the Pasok party, the junior coalition partner, will meet this afternoon to discuss the issue: The European Commission is playing down the risk of the Greek goverment collapsing over the row: Despite the government's best efforts, ERT is still transmitting online today. Here's a link to a working feed on Gegonota (with thanks to Spyros Gkelis) Greece's former minister for infrastructure, transport and networks, Makis Voridis, has defended the closure of ERT in the Athens parliament. Voridis, a government spokesman, told MPs that the government has two objectives -- reforming the country, and reducing the size of the civil service. He tried to reassure concerns over the move, saying the government is \"changing public TV in practice, it's something we've proven\" (quote via Diane Shugart who is live-tweeting proceedings in parliament today). But there are signs that the two junior members of the coalition are getting ready to oppose the decision, by bringing draft legislation to block it. Associated Press confirms that the closure of Greece's state broadcaster has caused anger and dismay in Athens (as well as in our comments field below): Greeks watched ERT's online program on laptops in corner shops and homes, many expressing disbelief at the decision to close it. \"I feel very bad. I'm very upset... This is a big loss for TV,\" Athens resident Eytixia Kaziani said. \"I feel bad for the channel; it was one of the best in Greece .... I'm making a plea to the government to reopen the channel and rehire ERT employees.\" Back to the closure of the Hellenic Broadcasting Corporation (ERT), and the European Commission has issued a statement on the attempts to close the broadcaster. It's not the most hard-hitting response, frankly. The EC says public sector broadcasters are important, but insists it can't interfere in Greek government's business (despite being a member of the Troika which is pushing for thousands of civil servants to be laid off) Statement by the European Commission on the closure of the Hellenic Broadcasting Corporation The European Commission has taken note of the decision by the Greek authorities to close down the Hellenic Broadcasting Corporation (ERT), a decision taken in full autonomy. The Commission has not sought the closure of ERT, but nor does the Commission question the Greek Government\u2019s mandate to manage the public sector. The decision of the Greek authorities should be seen in the context of the major and necessary efforts that the authorities are taking to modernise the Greek economy. Those include improving its efficiency and effectiveness of the public sector. The Commission understands the difficult situation of ERT staff and expects the announced dismissals to be carried out in full accordance with the applicable legal framework. The Commission supports the role of public broadcasting as an integral part of European democracy. The Treaty makes it clear that the governance and strategic choices on public service broadcasting lie with Member States. So while the Commission cannot prescribe Member States how to organise their public service broadcaster, we would like to highlight the role of public service broadcasters regarding European values in all economic circumstances, for the sake of media pluralism, media freedom and media quality and for the expression of cultural diversity. So we welcome the commitment of the Greek government to launch a media actor that fulfils the important role of public broadcasting and is financially sustainable. Some slightly encouraging economic news -- eurozone industrial output rose by 0.4% in April, the third monthly rise in a row, defying expectations that it would fall. However, energy use and production of 'durable consumer goods' fell -- the latter suggesting falling demand for more expensive item. Reuters has more details here. The ERT closure isn't the only important event in the eurozone crisis today (as kickinthenads chides me in the comments below) Over in Karlsruhe, the German constitutional court is continuing its hearing into the legality of the European Central Bank's bond-buying scheme. The Financial Times's Michael Steen is there, doing a great service tweeting the highlights. He reports that Hans Werner Sinn, one of Germany's most senior economists, told the court that the ECB might need to buy \u20ac3trn of eurozone bonds, if every other euro country including France (!) required support. The court case concludes today - a decision isn't expected for some weeks, and the whole issue could be referred to the European Court of Justice. The European Broadcasting Union, which represents all of Europe's public service broadcasters, has expressed its dismay at the decision to close the ERT station. Its president has written to the Greek prime minister urging to rethink its decision. Jean Paul Philippot, in a letter co-signed by EBU Director General, Ingrid Deltenre, wrote: While we recognize the need to make budgetary savings, national broadcasters are more important than ever at times of national difficulty. It said it was on standby to offer its knowledge of Europe's public service media to provide the advice, assistance and expertise necessary for ERT to be preserved as a true public broadcaster in the European mould (with thanks to my colleague Lisa O'Carroll) Supporters of ERT are organising demonstrations for this afternoon in London and Paris: Greek economics professor Yanis Varoufakis appeared on ERT in the early hours of the morning, and has written about the experience: I stepped outside the studio to a cacophonous web of corridors and then outside the building itself. To find thousands of people gathered, joining in ERT\u2019s excellent musicians in an impromptu heart-warming concert. When I left a couple of hours later, just before 5am, more people were arriving. Is this our Taksim Square? Only time will tell. So far the only certainty is that Greece took another step down the stairway to hell. More here: A night at occupied ERT. A night to remember. A night that friends at the BBC, ABC, CBC ought to note Nick Malkoutzis, deputy editor of Greece's Kathimerini English Edition, says Greek prime minister Antonis Samaras is taking a big gamble by closing ERT. The move will help Greece meet the job cut targets set by the Troika -- but shuttering the country's public service broadcaster risks inflaming the political situation, and will alarm many citizens, he writes: [Samaras's] decision for a \u201cbold\u201d move that would make up for the government\u2019s inability to chip away at the civil service by firing offenders and non-performers has ample potential to backfire. It\u2019s true that Samaras has stolen a march on his coalition partners, forcing them to put up or shut up in the government\u2019s bid to meet troika targets. But is this the best way to ensure the coalition remains intact and functioning? It\u2019s also true that Samaras\u2019s move shoves SYRIZA center stage, where it will have to show if it possesses the wherewithal to harness whatever anger is created by ERT\u2019s closure. But is it really wise to stoke the forces of protest and resistance when they appear to have abated? It\u2019s likely that there are Greeks who will interpret shutting down ERT as an indication that the government is willing to confront its challenges head-on. There are others, though, who will feel uncomfortable, even angered, by riot police standing in front of the country\u2019s public broadcaster \u2013 imagery that conjures up painful memories in a country that lived through a dictatorship in the not-too-distant past. Here's Nick's full piece: ERT off air: Thought for the day These photos show ERT workers kept the station running overnight, while large crowds gathered outside: The Press Project covered the ovenight developments in this live blog: \u039b\u03bf\u03c5\u03ba\u03ad\u03c4\u03bf \u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u0395\u03a1\u03a4, \u0396\u03c9\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd\u03ae \u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03ac\u03b4\u03bf\u03c3\u03b7 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03c3\u03ae\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 \u03b3\u03b9\u03b1 \u03cc\u03bb\u03bf \u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \u03ba\u03cc\u03c3\u03bc\u03bf. (in Greek). It reports that the ERT signal was turned off in some locations at 11pm local time (9pm BST), but that employees kept the service running through the night. At one stage, it says, the internet signal into the ERT headquarters was cut, \"but technicians found a way to continue the show\". Journalist Damian Mac Con Uladh of Enet English has also written about the overnight developments for the Irish Times: Employees at Greece\u2019s national broadcaster ERT vow to remain on air despite government action. He reports: Local media last night suggested the closure could be for at least three months, with about 1,000 staff expected to be taken into the new company. Current employees will be permitted to reapply for their jobs..... ERT has for years suffered from intense state interference, with successive governments stacking the station with political appointees and favourites. Last night, some journalists spoke openly on air about coming under pressure from the government to invite ministers on to programmes. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the latest events across the eurozone and the global economy. It's been a dramatic night in Greece, where workers at state broadcaster ERT have defied the government's attempt to shut them down. ERT journalists kept broadcasting online and on digital frequencies, as thousands of people gathered outside the organisation's headquarters in northeastern Athens to protest against the decision. Employees has been urged to leave the broadcaster's buildings or face being arrested, but remained on air through the night as riot police were also on standby near the complex. This feed appears to still be working right now. But already this morning other feeds have gone quiet: The government has said it wil reopen ERT with a smaller staff, claiming the broadcaster was bloated and inefficient. But the decision has caused a major political row in Athens. The junior partners in the Greek coalition are refusing to support the measure, while opposition leader Alexis Tsipras launched a stinging attack on the move. Kathimerini reports: Syriza leader Alexis Tsipras appeared live on ERT\u2019s main channel, NET, at around 3 a.m. on Wednesday to voice his opposition to the closure. He said that he had spoken to President Karolos Papoulias about the matter and claimed that the veteran politician was \u201ctroubled\u201d by the move to take ERT off air. Tsipras said he would meet Papoulias at noon on Wednesday to discuss the matter as he claimed that the government\u2019s legislative act allowing public enterprises, like ERT, to be shut down would not pass through Parliament. Greek journalists have called strike action today and tomorrow in solidarity with their colleagues at ERT. Public demonstrations are also planned: The government will be presenting legislation to parliament for the restructuring of ERT, which should give opponents a chance to debate the decision. There's even been some chatter that the row could spark early elections in Greece. That feels premature, but the situation is certainly a reminder that this crisis is not over, and still has the capacity to flare up. I'll be watching the developments in Greece and beyond through the day.",

      "bodyText": "The integrity of foreign exchange rate benchmarks has been called into question after the City regulator launched an investigation into potential manipulative trades in the currency markets. The new scrutiny of the foreign exchange markets, where \u00a33tn changes hands every day, by the Financial Conduct Authority is the latest investigation into benchmarks following the Libor scandal last year and the investigation into gas prices. It comes as the FCA and regulators in other countries continue an analysis of the hundreds of benchmarks used in financial markets around the world and in the next six weeks are expected to publish tougher guidelines for cleaning up the benchmarks. The FCA investigation into currency trading became apparent after Bloomberg reported allegations that traders at major banks were putting in client orders ahead of a 60-second window when benchmarks run by WM/Reuters \u2013 and used by fund managers to value their investments \u2013 are set. \"The FCA is aware of these allegations and has been speaking to the relevant parties. However, we can't comment further at this time,\" an FCA spokesman said. The benchmark rates are published hourly for 160 currencies and half hourly for the 21 biggest currencies, including sterling, which are set by calculating the median price of trades taking place in a 60-second window. The FCA's investigation has not yet become a formal one that could eventually lead to firms being disciplined for any manipulation, and no firms are under investigation. There are hundreds of benchmarks being used in financial markets to set a gauge for the price of items ranging from interest rates to wheat to fuel oil but many of them had been known only to market participants until the Libor-rigging scandal erupted last year. The international regulatory body known as International Organisation of Securities Commissions is now working on producing unified rules for benchmarks while Brussels has drawn proposals that could transfer regulation of benchmarks from London to Paris, where the pan-European securities regulator is based. Barclays was fined \u00a3290m a year ago this month, followed by Swiss bank UBS and bailed out bank Royal Bank of Scotland and four more financial firms are still awaiting the details of the penalties they will face from the FCA for their role in rigging the key benchmark rate. The regulator also began to investigate gas price benchmarks following a report in the Guardian sparked by claims by whistleblowers that the \u00a3300bn wholesale market was being manipulated. The European commission has also raided the offices of companies such as BP and Shell following allegations that oil prices were rigged for more than a decade. Changes to the Libor regime are still implemented by the British Bankers Association, which operates the benchmarks and on Wednesday said that the rates provided by individual banks would no longer be published daily as of 31 July. Regulators will receive the daily submissions to Libor but they will now be published with a three-month time delay.

The government and consumer groups welcomed the measures but some critics claimed they did not go nearly far enough while others expressed frustration it had taken Ofgem five years to act. There has been rising public and political anger about high prices and the dominant role of large suppliers such as British Gas, SSE and npower exacerbated by a series of investigations by Ofgem and the European commission into possible manipulation of wholesale energy markets. \"Ofgem's proposals will break the stranglehold of the big six in the retail market and create a more level playing field for independent suppliers, who will get a fair deal when they want to buy and sell power up to two years ahead,\" said Andrew Wright, senior partner for markets at Ofgem which first promised to act in 2008. \"Greater price transparency will assist investors seeking to build new generation plant and help secure supplies for consumers, who are also set to benefit from a simpler, clearer and fairer energy market thanks to our retail market reforms.\" Ed Davey, the secretary of state for energy and climate change, believed an increased role and level playing field for independent suppliers and generators would deliver \"better value\" for consumers and businesses. \"I encourage companies to work with Ofgem to implement these proposals as swiftly as possible.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A key Bank of England policymaker has warned of the risks to global financial stability when \"the biggest bond bubble in history\" bursts. In a wide-ranging testimony to MPs, Andy Haldane, Bank of England director of financial stability, admitted the central bank's new financial policy committee is taking too long to force banks to hold more capital and appeared to criticise the bank's culture under outgoing governor Sir Mervyn King.Haldane told the Treasury select committee that the bursting of the bond bubble \u2013 created by central banks forcing down bond yields by pumping electronic money into the economy \u2013 was a risk \"I feel acutely right now\". He also said banks have now put the threat of cyber attacks on the top of their the worry-list, replacing the long-running eurozone crisis. \"You can see why the financial sector would be a particularly good target for someone wanting to wreak havoc through the cyber route,\" Haldane said. But he described bond markets as the main risk to financial stability. \"If I were to single out what for me would be biggest risk to global financial stability right now it would be a disorderly reversion in the yields of government bonds globally.\" he said. There had been \"shades of that\" in recent weeks as government bond yields have edged higher amid talk that central banks, particularly the US Federal Reserve, will start to reduce its stimulus. \"Let's be clear. We've intentionally blown the biggest government bond bubble in history,\" Haldane said. \"We need to be vigilant to the consequences of that bubble deflating more quickly than [we] might otherwise have wanted.\" The Bank of England later issued a statement, describing Haldane's remarks as his \"personal view\" and stressed that if it raised interest rates \u2013 stuck at record lows since March 2009 \u2013 too quickly the consequences might be severe. \"Any attempt to return interest rates quickly to more normal levels would recreate recession conditions,\" the Bank of England. Haldane said the FPC was on alert to any bubbles created by the help to buy mortgage guarantee scheme for first-time buyers and house movers, stressing the scheme should be temporary. Referring to the US, he said: \"Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were temporary schemes and 75 years later they were still in place and blowing the world up.\" He said the FPC, which meets quarterly at the Bank of England to spot the next financial crisis, had not been \"entirely free\" of political interference over the way the bailed out banks Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group had been forced to raise more capital. A member of the FPC since it was created by the coalition in 2011, Haldane admitted the body had \"lacked clarity and decisiveness\" in setting capital levels for banks after first starting making recommendations on capital in 2011 but not concluding the shortfall was \u00a325bn until March 2013. \"With hindsight that was too long a period of uncertainty,\" Haldane said. He had argued more capital should have been put into the major banks and that the Treasury's refusal to put more cash into RBS and Lloyds had \"constrained\" options available to the FPC. In his written evidence he seemed to refer to the management style of the outgoing governor. Haldane wrote that one of his personal objectives as \"to contribute making the bank a more conversational, less hierarchical, more diverse, somewhat humbler organisation as a way of improving its accountability credibility and the quality of its decision making\". Andrew Tyrie, the chairman of the Treasury select committe, later raised comments made by Haldane and Donald Kohn, an external member of the FPC who also gave evidence, about the need to give the FPC power to limit the risks banks can take through the so-called leverage ratio. Haldane described this ratio as \"the most robust measure of bank capital adequacy\". International regulators are setting a leverage ratio at 3% by 2019 \u2013 which allows banks to leverage their capital 33 times \u2013 and the FPC had wanted the ability to be able to adjust this ratio to limit the risks banks run. \"Mr Haldane told us that 'a 33 times leveraged banking system sends shivers down my spine, if it were to be a long-run goal for financial stability',\" said Tyrie. \"The government should accept the banking commission's recommendations without further delay and grant the FPC this power,\" Tyrie said. Haldane said: \"For the FPC not to have been given directive powers over this instrument is a significant structural flaw in the current macro-prudential regime.\"",

      "standfirst": "Leading shares hit by corporate and eurozone worries, as well as continuing central bank concerns", 
      "body": "<p>Two takeover developments and renewed trouble in Greece have combined to send shares lower for the third day running.</p> <p>After a brightish start the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> finished 40.63 points lower at 6299.45, its third daily fall in a row and its lowest level since 22 April. Investors continued to be concerned about the prospect of central bank money taps being turned off and removing a key support for the market. This week's decision by the Bank of Japan to keep monetary policy on hold fed into that fear, and next week's US Federal Reserve meeting will be closely watched for further clues.</p> <p>Meanwhile in Greece, the government's decision to close the state broadcaster led to demonstrations and talk of a vote of confidence, even a new election.</p> <p>As for the takeovers, one was a failed bid and the other a new one.</p> <p><strong>Severn Trent</strong> slumped 172p to \u00a317.65 after its potential bidder, the LongRiver consortium, announced it was walking away, having failed to engage in constructive talks before Tuesday's deadline. LongRiver, comprising Canada's Borealis, a Kuwait sovereign wealth fund and the UK Universities Superannuation Scheme, was offering \u00a322 a share.</p> <p>Severn is now below the \u00a318.25 level prevailing before the bid was revealed. Analyst Verity Mitchell at HSBC said:</p> <blockquote> Given that the previous offers for water and sewerage companies have been successful, this is a surprising development. We had remained cautious about the success of the bid throughout given that it was so close to the 2014 regulatory price review and in the light of the water regulator, Ofwat's, scrutiny of privately-held companies. </blockquote> <p>Meanwhile <strong>Vodafone</strong> confirmed long standing, and growing, speculation that it was interested in Kabel Deutschland, saying it had made a preliminary approach but there was no guarantee an offer would be made.</p> <p>A move on Germany's biggest cable operator would add its infrastructure to Vodafone's mainly mobile network, and at around \u20ac10bn, it would be the company's biggest deal since 2007.</p> <p>Vodafone shares, which also went gone ex-dividend, closed 11p lower at 181p. Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, said:</p> <blockquote> It looks like it wants to spend on M&amp;A now, which brings risk to the table with the possibility of acquired assets failing to deliver growth desired and needed to revive growth in a stagnant Europe. </blockquote> <p>Miners came under pressure as investors avoided riskier assets, with <strong>Vedanta Resources</strong> down 40p at \u00a311.49 and <strong>Randgold Resources</strong> falling 111p to \u00a348.15.</p> <p>But <strong>Aberdeen Asset Management</strong> recovered a little from its recent poor run, rising 6.7p to 402.5p.</p> <p>Elsewhere <strong>BT</strong> added 4.3p to 309.3p after analysts at Exane BNP Paribas raised their price target from 250p to 277p. <strong>BSkyB</strong> was 10.5p better at 788.5p for a similar reason, as Exane lifted its forecast price from 920p to 970p. There was also talk that News Corporation could have another tilt at the satellite broadcaster.</p> <p><strong>National Express</strong> accelerated 3%, up 6.2p to 212.4p, despite one of its biggest investors selling its remaining stake in the transport group for around \u00a3101m. UBS placed 50.6m shares at 200.5p on behalf of US hedge fund Elliott Advisors, its last remaining shareholding after <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/marketforceslive/2013/mar/06/national-express-elliott-share-sale\" title=\"\">it sold a 9.9% stake in March</a>.</p> <p><strong>Heritage Oil</strong>, which is being demoted from the FTSE 250 to the small cap index in the latest reshuffle, jumped more than 4% to 142.4p following news that production at its flagship project in Nigeria had recovered after a period of low output. In April the company unsettled investors by failing to give an output forecast for 2013. Now it says:</p> <blockquote> The temporary factors which caused lower than expected production levels over the first quarter have been successfully addressed. We are on track to meet our production target for the year. </blockquote> <p>Meanwhile price comparison site <strong>Moneysupermarket.com</strong> led the FTSE 250 fallers, down 14.7p to 183.8p, mainly due to its shares going ex-dividend. But analysts at Canaccord Genuity issued a buy note, saying:</p> <blockquote> [Its valuation] looks attractive for a structural growth story, with a strong brand, which is raising the barriers to entry. </blockquote> <p>Online fashion retailer <strong>Asos</strong> added 51p to \u00a340.32 after reporting a 45% rise in third quarter sales to a better than expected \u00a3194m. Its recent tie up with Primark has seen \"phenomenal\" demand in the first week of its trial, the company said.

      "bodyText": "Two takeover developments and renewed trouble in Greece have combined to send shares lower for the third day running. After a brightish start the FTSE 100 finished 40.63 points lower at 6299.45, its third daily fall in a row and its lowest level since 22 April. Investors continued to be concerned about the prospect of central bank money taps being turned off and removing a key support for the market. This week's decision by the Bank of Japan to keep monetary policy on hold fed into that fear, and next week's US Federal Reserve meeting will be closely watched for further clues. Meanwhile in Greece, the government's decision to close the state broadcaster led to demonstrations and talk of a vote of confidence, even a new election. As for the takeovers, one was a failed bid and the other a new one. Severn Trent slumped 172p to \u00a317.65 after its potential bidder, the LongRiver consortium, announced it was walking away, having failed to engage in constructive talks before Tuesday's deadline. LongRiver, comprising Canada's Borealis, a Kuwait sovereign wealth fund and the UK Universities Superannuation Scheme, was offering \u00a322 a share. Severn is now below the \u00a318.25 level prevailing before the bid was revealed. Analyst Verity Mitchell at HSBC said: Given that the previous offers for water and sewerage companies have been successful, this is a surprising development. We had remained cautious about the success of the bid throughout given that it was so close to the 2014 regulatory price review and in the light of the water regulator, Ofwat's, scrutiny of privately-held companies. Meanwhile Vodafone confirmed long standing, and growing, speculation that it was interested in Kabel Deutschland, saying it had made a preliminary approach but there was no guarantee an offer would be made. A move on Germany's biggest cable operator would add its infrastructure to Vodafone's mainly mobile network, and at around \u20ac10bn, it would be the company's biggest deal since 2007. Vodafone shares, which also went gone ex-dividend, closed 11p lower at 181p. Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, said: It looks like it wants to spend on M&amp;A now, which brings risk to the table with the possibility of acquired assets failing to deliver growth desired and needed to revive growth in a stagnant Europe. Miners came under pressure as investors avoided riskier assets, with Vedanta Resources down 40p at \u00a311.49 and Randgold Resources falling 111p to \u00a348.15. But Aberdeen Asset Management recovered a little from its recent poor run, rising 6.7p to 402.5p. Elsewhere BT added 4.3p to 309.3p after analysts at Exane BNP Paribas raised their price target from 250p to 277p. BSkyB was 10.5p better at 788.5p for a similar reason, as Exane lifted its forecast price from 920p to 970p. There was also talk that News Corporation could have another tilt at the satellite broadcaster. National Express accelerated 3%, up 6.2p to 212.4p, despite one of its biggest investors selling its remaining stake in the transport group for around \u00a3101m. UBS placed 50.6m shares at 200.5p on behalf of US hedge fund Elliott Advisors, its last remaining shareholding after it sold a 9.9% stake in March. Heritage Oil, which is being demoted from the FTSE 250 to the small cap index in the latest reshuffle, jumped more than 4% to 142.4p following news that production at its flagship project in Nigeria had recovered after a period of low output. In April the company unsettled investors by failing to give an output forecast for 2013. Now it says: The temporary factors which caused lower than expected production levels over the first quarter have been successfully addressed. We are on track to meet our production target for the year. Meanwhile price comparison site Moneysupermarket.com led the FTSE 250 fallers, down 14.7p to 183.8p, mainly due to its shares going ex-dividend. But analysts at Canaccord Genuity issued a buy note, saying: [Its valuation] looks attractive for a structural growth story, with a strong brand, which is raising the barriers to entry. Online fashion retailer Asos added 51p to \u00a340.32 after reporting a 45% rise in third quarter sales to a better than expected \u00a3194m. Its recent tie up with Primark has seen \"phenomenal\" demand in the first week of its trial, the company said. Bethany Hocking at Investec said: Our target price moves to \u00a348 [from \u00a339].

      "bodyText": "Wednesday's jobs figures contained some encouraging signs for green-shoots watchers: employment growth resumed, with 24,000 more people in work, and unemployment declined, albeit by a marginal 5,000. That suggests the weaker period at the start of the year may have been a blip, instead of the start of a renewed downturn in the labour market. But the broad picture in the UK remains of a workforce watching helplessly as wage growth is relentlessly outpaced by the increase in the cost of living. As thinktank the Resolution Foundation points out, earnings have now been failing to keep up with inflation for 40 straight months. That's precisely the picture set out by the Institute for Fiscal Studies in its latest research, of employees holding on to their jobs but continuing to accept declining real wages in exchange for not being chucked on the scrap heap. Overall earnings growth actually picked up, rising by 1.3% a year in the three months to April. But that is likely to reflect bonuses being pushed into the new financial year, as the top rate of income tax was reduced from 50p to 45p. Without bonuses, pay growth remained painfully weak, at 0.9% \u2013 less than half the rate of inflation. As the IFS pointed out, there are structural reasons for this, not least the collapse of trade union bargaining power. And as they also pointed out, staying in work albeit on declining real wages is far better than trying to manage on unemployment benefit. But for politicians hoping for a return of the feelgood factor \u2013 or economy watchers pinning their hopes on a revival in consumer spending \u2013 there is, as yet, little reason for optimism. As Resolution's James Plunkett puts it, \"we know that this trend is almost certain to continue through 2014 and into 2015 before there's a realistic prospect of wages beginning to recover. Even then it is likely to be several years before wages return to levels seen before the recession.\"",

It also plans to open 10 or 12 supermarkets, although King said these would not be the big-box superstores with large non-food ranges favoured by rival supermarkets.</p> <p>\"We have always felt a 120,000 sq ft out-of-town store was not the right choice for us or our customers,\" he said. \"The challenges others are facing are largely in the parts their real estate that are very large and dominated by non-food and often non-food that has very little relevance to a grocery customer.\"</p> <p>Tesco has been hit by a sharp decline in non-food sales, such as TVs and electronics, where competition from internet retailers such as Amazon is fierce.</p> <p>Clive Black, head of research at Shore Capital, said Sainsbury's could expect further growth at modest rates. But he added: \"The bigger issue is the extent to which Sainbury's can translate sales growth into profit and earnings growth and they have struggled to do that in recent years and that could be problematic going forward.\" This difficulty reflected \"the high cost of competing in the UK grocery market\", as the UK's big four supermarkets face intensifying competition from discounters Aldi and Lidl, as well as premium stores Waitrose and Marks and Spencer.</p> <p>\"The market is very tough. People are being very careful in how they are buying food, more so than other categories,\" he said. \"The big four players are really slugging it out.\"</p>",

Justin King, chief executive of Sainsbury's, who last week was awarded a 23% pay rise taking his overall remuneration to \u00a34.3m, said it was a solid performance in a tough consumer environment. He acknowledged that sales growth had slowed compared to \"exceptionally strong performance\" in the fourth quarter, when Sainsbury's picked up sales from rivals hit by the horsemeat scandal. King said he expected sales to vary from quarter to quarter, as consumers save their money for special occasions. The outlook was likely to remain challenging, he said, as shoppers wait for the good weather to splash out. \"If we get a spell of sustained warm weather I fully expect consumers to be reasonably buoyant in their spending but if we get a spell of bad weather, which I am sure we will because it is summer, then I think we will see consumers ratchet back their spending, so they have [money] to spend when the sun is shining. And that pattern has been with us for a number of years.\" The grocer, which opened 19 new convenience stores in the last quarter, said it was on course to open two convenience stores a week for the rest of the year. It also plans to open 10 or 12 supermarkets, although King said these would not be the big-box superstores with large non-food ranges favoured by rival supermarkets. \"We have always felt a 120,000 sq ft out-of-town store was not the right choice for us or our customers,\" he said. \"The challenges others are facing are largely in the parts their real estate that are very large and dominated by non-food and often non-food that has very little relevance to a grocery customer.\" Tesco has been hit by a sharp decline in non-food sales, such as TVs and electronics, where competition from internet retailers such as Amazon is fierce. Clive Black, head of research at Shore Capital, said Sainsbury's could expect further growth at modest rates. But he added: \"The bigger issue is the extent to which Sainbury's can translate sales growth into profit and earnings growth and they have struggled to do that in recent years and that could be problematic going forward.\" This difficulty reflected \"the high cost of competing in the UK grocery market\", as the UK's big four supermarkets face intensifying competition from discounters Aldi and Lidl, as well as premium stores Waitrose and Marks and Spencer. \"The market is very tough. People are being very careful in how they are buying food, more so than other categories,\" he said. \"The big four players are really slugging it out.\"",

      "bodyText": "Unemployment in Britain fell by 5,000 in the three months to April as the economy's return to growth created more jobs. Figures released by the Office for National Statistics showed that the jobless total using the internationally agreed yardstick dipped to 2.51 million. Employment rose by 24,000 during the quarter, beating City expectations of a small fall in the number of people in work. The ONS said there were now 29.76 million people in employment, up 432,000 on a year ago. Jobs continue to be shed from the public sector, with employment down by 22,000 in the latest three months for which data is available, the three months to March 2013. But an expanding private sector created 46,000 additional jobs in the same period. The ONS said the UK's jobless rate remained unchanged between the latest quarters at 7.8% but that it was down 0.4 points on a year earlier. The government's alternative measure of unemployment \u2013 the number of people claiming jobseeker's allowance \u2013 fell by 8,600 to 1.51 million in May, the ONS said. Higher bonus payments led to an increase in the rate of growth of average earnings. Although still running below the current 2.7% inflation rate, earnings were 1.3% higher between February and April than a year earlier. That compared with a 0.6% increase in the three months ending in March. James Knightley, economist at ING, described the data as \"encouraging\", adding that \"when coupled with recent better business survey figures and rising consumer and business confidence suggests we should be looking for a positive GDP figure in the region of 0.4 to 0.5% quarter-on-quarter for the second quarter of 2013\". Vicky Redwood, UK analyst at Capital Economics said: \"The latest data bring slightly better news on the labour market, although it is still looking rather weaker than a few months ago. After falling earlier this year, employment managed to rise by 24,000 in the three months to April. A rise in private sector employment offset a fall in the public sector jobcount.\" Seperate figures released by the Institute for Fiscal Studies showed that British workers have suffered unprecedented pay cuts of 6% in real terms since the financial crisis began five years ago. Paul Johnson, director of the IFS, said household incomes and spending had fallen deeper and stay lower longer than in any previous downturn since the Great Depression.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Network Rail will have to cut more than \u00a32bn from its spending plans over the next five years and meet tougher punctuality targets, the rail regulator has announced. The Office of Rail Regulation (ORR) said it had identified billions in savings to be made in Network Rail's business plan, while still allowing Britain's railways to grow over the next five years. But the track operator said it had already made huge savings, while unions said cuts would worsen the service and warned of strikes if jobs were lost. Campaigners called for the savings to be passed on to passengers by curbing planned fare rises. The ORR said the day-to-day running of the railway could be managed more efficiently and cheaply without jeopardising safety. The overall total will be reduced to \u00a337.9bn from a proposed \u00a340.1bn, including interest payments. This could be cut further next year as the regulator warned that \u00a312bn approved in principle for investment would not be released until detailed plans showed value for taxpayer money. Network Rail last week announced its debt had increased to more than \u00a330bn, and the government has said it wants the cost of the railways to the taxpayer to be reduced. Passenger numbers are expected to rise by a further 14% by 2019. The ORR is also demanding at least 90% of trains running on time on every route with a higher overall average target of 92.5% punctuality, as well as higher standards of network infrastructure management and improved safety for passengers and railway workers. The ORR's chief executive, Richard Price, said: \"Britain's railway is a success story and it has made significant progress over the last decade. In order to sustain this progress and retain support and confidence, the industry must continue to improve its efficiency to reduce its dependence on public subsidy.\" Network Rail responded that it had already achieved cost savings of 40% in the last decade. A spokesman said: \"A decision of this significance, which will be important not only for the railway's 4 million daily passengers and freight users, but also the economic prosperity of the country and the future sustainability of the network, needs careful and detailed thought. We will take the time necessary to analyse our regulator's initial findings before giving our formal response in September.\" The budget will be formally approved at the end of October. Price told the Guardian the savings would mean Network Rail could \"meet the challenge of the McNulty review\", the 2011 report that called for deep cuts to provide better value for money in the railways, although he stressed there was more to do across the rest of the industry. He claimed other sectors showed that better planning management of assets could improve reliability and cut costs. Unions warned that trying to find savings through compulsory job losses would mean an immediate strike ballot. The RMT general secretary, Bob Crow, added that the \u00a32bn cuts would compromise maintenance and safety: \"Far from improving performance it would mean overhead lines coming down and track and signal failures leading to travel misery for millions.\" Price said that while technology could replace certain jobs, he did not envisage job losses overall, with investment in the railway creating a demand for many new skilled posts. He insisted that the maintenance budget was protected and safety \"deliberately ringfenced\". He said the figures, which will form Network Rail's funding settlement for the next five years, meant that the track operator's plans were now \"affordable\". The savings could potentially be used to cut fares but that was a \"political choice\", he said: \"This addresses the fundamental underlying issue of what the railway costs. It gives the Department for Transport the choice to pass this on to rail passengers or taxpayers.\" Richard Hebditch of the Campaign for Better Transport said: \"There is a clear implication in the ORR's report that it is time for the government to use these savings to end above-inflation fare rises. Ministers have promised to end such rises when cost savings are identified \u2013 the ORR has provided the evidence, now ministers must act.\"",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain's workers have suffered more financial pain since 2008 than in any five-year period of the modern age, according to research by a leading tax thinktank that shows employees have sacrificed pay to keep their jobs. Describing this downturn as the longest and deepest slump in a century, the Institute for Fiscal Studies says workers have suffered unprecedented pay cuts of 6% in real terms over the last five years. Historically, real wages rise by about 2% a year. This suggests that people are more than 15% worse off than they would have been if the pre-crisis wage trends had continued. Analysing downturns going back to the great depression, Paul Johnson, director of the IFS, said: \"This time really does seem to be different \u2026 it has been deeper and longer than those of the 1990s, the 1980s and even the 1930s. It has seen household incomes and spending drop more and stay lower longer.\" The report finds that since the start of the recession real wages have fallen by more than in any comparable five-year period. It also highlights an \"unprecedented\" drop in productivity as output has tumbled faster than employment. Official figures on Tuesday brought little comfort for ministers looking for a manufacturing revival to turn the tide on productivity. Hopes that a pick-up in industry would lead to better balanced growth in the UK were dented by data for April showing the first decline in factory production in three months. The Office for National Statistics said factories were producing 10% less than they were in 2007, before the onset of the recession in early 2008. David Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce, said: \"Our manufacturing exporters are still overly focused on the weak eurozone, but low domestic demand has also limited progress.\" The service sector was facing its own challenges from demand being sucked out of the economy by the squeeze on wages, economists warned. \"This period has seen the biggest squeeze of real pay in decades,\" said Michael Pearce, at Capital Economics. \"We're not expecting this damage [to households' real pay] to be reversed any time soon, highlighting one reason not to get too carried away by recent signs of economic recovery.\" The IFS says much of the sharp drop in pay is down to widespread nominal wage cuts for workers staying in the same jobs, rather than being driven by inflation outpacing pay growth or people losing high paid jobs and taking worse paid roles. One-third of workers experienced nominal wage freezes or cuts between 2010 and 2011, and 70% experienced real wage cuts, the thinktank says, blaming in part a drop in the number of unionised workers. A new TUC campaign for pay rises this week chimes with that finding. It launched with the claim that the UK's annual pay packet had shrunk by \u00a352bn since the start of the financial crisis. The IFS said the silver lining was that employment had held up and so there was no repeat of the policy errors of the 1980s when millions were allowed to \"leave the labour force altogether and receive disability benefits or lone-parent benefits, or move into early retirement\". Claire Crawford, programme director at the IFS said: \"The falls in nominal wages that workers have experienced during this recession are unprecedented, and seem to provide at least a partial explanation for why unemployment has risen less \u2013 and productivity has fallen more \u2013 than might otherwise have been expected. \"To the extent that it is better for individuals to stay in work, albeit with lower wages, than to become unemployed, the long-term consequences of this recession in terms of labour market performance may be less severe than following the high unemployment recessions of the 1980s and 1990s.\" A Treasury spokesman said: \"As the IFS says, the UK is recovering from the 'longest and deepest' recession in a century. Despite this, the labour market has remained strong: one-and-a-quarter-million private sector jobs have been created and more people are in private sector employment than ever before.\"",
