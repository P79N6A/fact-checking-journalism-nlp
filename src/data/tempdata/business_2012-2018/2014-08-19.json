      "body": "<p>British construction firm Carillion has raised for the third time its merger proposal for engineering company Balfour Beatty, with new terms that value its rival at \u00a32.1bn.</p> <p>Carillion said under the new offer Balfour shareholders would have 58.3% of the combined firm. They would also get a cash dividend of 8.5p per share.</p> <p>The raised offer came after talks with Balfour's biggest shareholders in the past week.

      "bodyText": "British construction firm Carillion has raised for the third time its merger proposal for engineering company Balfour Beatty, with new terms that value its rival at \u00a32.1bn. Carillion said under the new offer Balfour shareholders would have 58.3% of the combined firm. They would also get a cash dividend of 8.5p per share. The raised offer came after talks with Balfour's biggest shareholders in the past week. Its negotiations with Balfour's board ended last month after the two sides clashed over the sale of Balfour's US engineering and design business Parsons Brinckerhoff. Balfour, which built the aquatics centre for London 2012 and is transforming the Olympic stadium, has said it expects to sell Parsons Brinckerhoff for between \u00a3580m and \u00a3650m but Carillion insisted in earlier talks the sale should be cancelled. Niall Dineen, portfolio manager at City investor AGF International Advisors and a shareholder in both the companies, said the improvement in the offer should be enough to get Balfour Beatty to engage. \"The Carillion argument regarding synergies seems sensible, the Carillion idea of keeping the Parsons Brinckerhoff business seems sensible and the improvement in the offer should be enough to get Balfour Beatty to engage with them,\" he said.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A measure of global trade has soared over the past fortnight, signalling a possible return to health of the world economy. The Baltic Dry daily index of shipping costs has jumped by more than 40% in a month, soaring to 1,042 since it hit a post crash low of 732 in July. The jump in prices for sending freight goods around the world indicates that shipping firms are seeing a sharp rise in demand for their services. Figures from Lloyds List show the index performed badly throughout 2013 and the first half of 2014, when many shipping companies reported losing money on each container ship, many of which sailed half empty. A gentle rise in prices charged by shippers since early July has accelerated in the last two weeks, taking many analysts by surprise. Jim Leaviss, head of fixed interest at M&amp;G Investments, said: \"Although it's a pretty volatile indicator there is a strong relationship between the cost of shipping bulk cargo \u2013 generally intermediate goods like metals \u2013 and the strength of the global economy. So the recent 40% rise in the Baltic Dry Index might well be telling us that the global recovery is back on track after a pretty patchy first half of 2014.\" Leaviss added that the timing of the Russian sanctions against the EU and the rise in the index might not be a coincidence, possibly reflecting that Russia might be having to ship goods, including food, from further away now that it cannot import from the EU. David Blanchflower, professor of economics at Dartmouth College, New Hampshire, and a former Bank of England policymaker, said the Baltic Dry was traditionally a key indicator of the health of global economy, illustrated by the sharp fall in the index between May and December of 2008. \"The fall in 2008 was the most catastrophic collapse of any indicator in the Great Recession. The question now is, does it indicate a turnaround? The rise might be driven by an increase in demand, or a fall in ship supply, or both.\" On Monday one of the major container shipping organisations urged fleet owners to raise rates on their Asia to US routes by at least $600 per 40-foot container, an increase of 14% from current levels. Transpacific Stabilisation Agreement (TSA), a lobby group for operators between the US and Asia, said the planned increase followed strong cargo demand and higher capacity levels in recent months, which forward bookings suggest will continue through September. Its members include 15 of the world's biggest container shipping lines such as Denmark's Maersk Line, a unit of A.P. Moller-Maersk, privately owned Switzerland-based Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC), French privately held CMA CGM, China's COSCO Shipping and Korea's Hanjin Shipping. TSA executive administrator Brian Conrad said prices should go up from 1 September to reflect higher demand and offset losses from last year. \"Lines have made modest revenue gains to date this year, but they continue to struggle in terms of returning to profitability,\" he said. The container shipping industry has been struggling as vessel capacity has outstripped the volumes of goods for transport in the global economic downturn. More than 90% of the world's trade is carried by sea, but the overcapacity meant freight rates plunged to unprofitable levels for most carriers in 2013. Spot freight rates are calculated and published every week by Shanghai Shipping Exchange. Last week rates for transport of 40-foot containers from Asia to the U.S. West Coast stood at $4,218. The Baltic Dry, which is a composite of costs across all major shipping routes, is issued daily by the London-based Baltic Exchange and provides \"an assessment of the price of moving the major raw materials by sea\". Mearsk parent, AP M\u00f8ller-Maersk, gave a further indication of a return to health on global shipping route after it said better than expected profits in the second quarter of the year meant it would offer shareholders a \u00a31bn buyback. The Danish owner of the world's largest container shipping line also upgraded its prediction of full year profits to more than $4.5bn, up from its already raised forecast of $4bn three months ago. Maersk Line, which transports about 15% of seaborne freight, is considered a good proxy for global trade.",

It said if the bank\u2019s practice had gone unchallenged, many borrowers would have lost their homes.</p> <p>One of the people whom the HRS acted for was a female bank worker who fell behind on her mortgage because she had to leave her home as she was being targeted by criminals. In addition her partner tied while she was out of house. As a result she fell behind on her mortgage payments and was later forced to make monthly payments above the original contracted amount for more than one year.</p> <p>Christopher McGrath, a lawyer acting for HRS, said: \u201cThe court has stated that the handling of accounts by Bank of Scotland in these instances, created \u2018a mist of incomprehension, confusion and self -contradiction\u2019.</p> <p>\u201cIt is our view that this practice unfettered would undoubtedly have resulted in many borrowers unnecessarily losing their home.\u201d </p> <p>A Lloyds Banking Group spokesperson said the bank was considering the judgement and will \u201crespond accordingly\u201d when it has fully reviewed the findings.

After their Iraq-related rally, oil prices have dropped sharply over the past month, with Brent dropping below $100 a barrel yesterday for the first time in fifteen months.

Furthermore, today\u2019s data suggest that \u2013 if anything \u2013 the pressures coming along the supply chain are disinflationary. This all adds up to inflation remaining close to 1\u00bd% over the second half of the year.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>The game of predicting when the Bank of England might raise interest rates took another spin, with economists explained that the fall in inflation makes a pre-Christmas hike less likely.<br></p> <h2>Here\u2019s our news story: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/aug/19/uk-cpi-inflation-fall-lessens-interest-rate-rise\">UK inflation fall to 1.6% lessens likelihood of interest rate rise</a></h2> <p>Echoing that theory, the pound tumbled on the news, shedding almost a whole cent against the US dollar to a four-month low $1.6633. <br></p> <p><strong>Andy Scott,</strong> spokesperson for FX advisory services at foreign currency specialists, HiFX, explains: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cDespite the economy growing at its fastest pace in several years and unemployment falling to its lowest level since the end of 2008, employees are receiving wage increases below the current rate of inflation, resulting in a squeeze on annual earnings in real terms. This indicates that there may indeed be additional slack in the labour market that needs to be used up in order for pay to keep up with inflation and gives the BoE scope to continue to keep rates on hold. </p> <p>Another factor that\u2019s probably winning the argument against raising rates too soon is that some of the world\u2019s major economies either contracted or saw minimal growth in the last quarter.

Living standards will carry on falling deep into the autumn even if wages do start to pick up.</p> <p>Some City analysts think 2014 will also be the year of the interest rate rise. That, too, is starting to look questionable given not just the weakness of CPI inflation but also the lack of any real price pressure in the pipeline. The producer prices index, a guide to the costs paid by manufacturers and the price of goods leaving factory gates, shows that the drop in fuel and raw material costs together with tight control of pay is allowing firms to cut tariff prices.</p> <p>An interest rate rise by the end of the year \u2013 November being the likeliest date \u2013 should not be ruled out, but it will be on the basis of what the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee thinks is going to happen to inflation rather than what is actually happening.</p> </blockquote> <h2>More here: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/2014/aug/19/uk-inflation-figures-pay-rise-interest-rates\">UK inflation figures - say goodbye to your pay rise</a></h2> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-53f33275e4b092330feea042\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-08-19T11:18:16.086Z\">12.18pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/EY_ITEMClub/statuses/501680454156955648\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Little immediate pressure on the MPC to raise rates after today&#39;s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/inflation?src=hash\">#inflation</a> figures.

But there is absolutely no guarantee that will be the outcome. In the autumn statement last year, the Chancellor cancelled the RPI+1% increase scheduled for January 2014, replacing it with just a straightforward RPI increase. What will happen in January 2015? We know that the RPI figure will be used - but whether it will be +1% or zero, or something else, is for now speculative.</p> <p>This morning, a Department for Transport spokesman said: <strong>\u201c</strong>No decisions on fare rises for 2015 have yet been taken. We understand people\u2019s concerns about the cost of travel and the impact this has on family budgets.

      "bodyText": "With hopes that tensions between Russia and Ukraine could be easing, leading shares have recorded another day of gains. The FTSE 100 has hit a three week high - details in Nick Fletcher\u2019s closing market report - while European markets have also moved higher, as have US shares. Inflation data from the UK and US suggested there was not likely to be an imminent rise in interest rates although stronger than expected US housing starts muddied the picture. And there could be further volatility with Bank of England minutes on Wednesday and speeches from Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen and ECB boss Mario Draghi at the Jackson Hole get-together on Friday. Meanwhile the closing stock market scores were: The FTSE 100 finished 38.06 points or 0.56% higher at 6779.31 Germany\u2019s Dax rose 0.96% to 9334.28 France\u2019s Cac climbed 0.56% to 4254.45 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB edged up 0.02% to 19,644.37 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 0.32% better at 10,386.5 In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 70 points or 0.42% higher. And on that note, it\u2019s time to close up for the evening. Thanks for your comments and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Back in the City, an ongoing takeover battle has just taken another twist. Construction company Carillion announced that its raised its offer for rival Balfour Beatty. It\u2019s now offering a 36% premium to Balfour\u2019s share price in late July, before merger plans were made public. Carillion said it had made the new offer \u201cfollowing discussions with Balfour Beatty\u2019s major shareholders\u201d, which piles more pressure on Balfour\u2019s management to return to the negotiating table. For talks to take place, though, Balfour would have to ask the Takeover Panel to extend its \u2018put up or shut up\u2019 deadline, of this Thursday. The clock is ticking.... In other news, Elizabeth Arden\u2019s new celebrity perfumes have failed to wow the public. The cosmetics chain reported its biggest fall in profits ever, after quarterly sales tumbled by over 28%. Elizabeth Arden, which sells celebrity perfumes from the likes of Justin Bieber and Taylor Swift, also warned that weak sales would continue for the next six months Shares have tumbled by 25% today - not the sweet smell of success that investors were looking for. America\u2019s stock market has opened in positive territory, after the latest US inflation data showed little signs of inflationary pressures building. Traders also showed relief that there\u2019s been no further escalation in tensions between Russia and Ukraine. The Nasdaq index, heavy with tech stocks, hit a new 14-year high in early trading, while the Dow Jones is up 0.25%. Most European markets are also holding their earlier gains, led by the German DAX, up around 1%. Back on this side of the Atlantic, a judge has sharply criticised the Bank of Scotland for double-charging mortgage holders in Northern Ireland who were behind in their payments Henry McDonald, Ireland Correspondent, reports: In a judgement released in Belfast today judge Master Ellison accused the bank of unfair accounting over double billing some of its customers for mortgages. He said: \u201cThere may not be any fraud involved, but I would certainly not regard this as fair accounting.\u201d The judge excoriated the bank and its offshoots, including Halifax, after three Northern Ireland customers took cases against it. Such practices to punish late payments on mortgages had \u201cplunged into depression\u201d many home owners in distress. Overall the bank\u2019s behaviour had been \u201cunconscionable\u201d, the judge concluded. The Housing Rights Service (HRS) in Northern Ireland took up the cases on behalf of three mortgage holders. It said if the bank\u2019s practice had gone unchallenged, many borrowers would have lost their homes. One of the people whom the HRS acted for was a female bank worker who fell behind on her mortgage because she had to leave her home as she was being targeted by criminals. In addition her partner tied while she was out of house. As a result she fell behind on her mortgage payments and was later forced to make monthly payments above the original contracted amount for more than one year. Christopher McGrath, a lawyer acting for HRS, said: \u201cThe court has stated that the handling of accounts by Bank of Scotland in these instances, created \u2018a mist of incomprehension, confusion and self -contradiction\u2019. \u201cIt is our view that this practice unfettered would undoubtedly have resulted in many borrowers unnecessarily losing their home.\u201d A Lloyds Banking Group spokesperson said the bank was considering the judgement and will \u201crespond accordingly\u201d when it has fully reviewed the findings. It owns Bank of Scotland-Halifax, which is a major bank for home owners in Northern Ireland. The spokesperson added that the bank encourages customers to contact them at the earliest opportunity if they believe that they will be unable to make their monthly mortgage payment. The surge in the US housing sector has pushed the dollar up against other major currencies. This sent the euro sliding to a nine-month low of $1.3318. That could be quietly welcomed in the European Central Bank, as the euro\u2019s strength has been one factor pushing down eurozone inflation (to just 0.4%). America has also seen a surge in new house-building projects, in a sign that the economy picked up last month. Housing starts (the number of new home building projects) jumped by 15% in July to an annual rate of 1.093m. up from 945,000 in June. And the number of new permits being granted to home-builders also rose sharply, to an annual rate of 1.052m, from 973k. Demand for new multi-occupancy units (think apartments) led the revival. America\u2019s inflation crept up a little last month, as higher food and rent costs were countered by a drop in energy costs. Consumer prices rose by 0.1% in July, the smallest rise in five months. The annual CPI index was 2.0% higher than a year ago. That\u2019s down on June\u2019s 2.1%. Food prices jumped by 0.4% during the month, while housing costs rose by 0.2%. Energy costs, though, fell by 0.3%, as did the price of gasoline at the pumps, reflecting the recent drop in the oil price. Core CPI, stripping out food and energy, was unchanged at +0.1% month-on-month. That\u2019s a weaker rise than economists had predicted. At first glance, there\u2019s little sign of inflationary pressures that would force the Federal Reserve into changing its view of the US economy, and the likely pace of rate rises. I\u2019ll pull together some reaction now.... One down, one to go.... We\u2019re about to get the US inflation date for July. Economists predict that the Consumer Price Index could come in at 2.0%, down from 2.1% in June. Business Insider\u2019s preview explains: Expectations are for CPI to rise 0.1% month-over-month, and 2% year-over-year. \u201cCore\u201d CPI, which excludes food and gas \u2014 which tend to be more volatile \u2014 is expected to rise 0.2% over last month and 1.9% over last year. Recap time, before the latest US inflation data hits the wires. The UK inflation rate has fallen sharply, as clothing sales pulled back the rising cost of living. The Consumer Prices Index fell to 1.6%, a bigger drop than expected, with food prices also falling. The Office for National Statistics found that clothing prices tumbled by 5.9% month-on-month in July, as high street shops belatedly got their summer sales under way. Firms also reported that the cost of raw materials fell. The government parties have argued that the recent drop in inflation shows that their policies are paying off. The opposition Labour party, though, said the weak wage growth (just 0.6% at present, or -0.2% including bonuses) means real pay is still falling. Full political reaction here. Martin Beck, senior economic adviser to the EY ITEM Club, predicts that inflation will remain below the 2% target for several months: \u201cThe inflation environment remains benign. After their Iraq-related rally, oil prices have dropped sharply over the past month, with Brent dropping below $100 a barrel yesterday for the first time in fifteen months. And though the pound has weakened a little of late, it remains much higher than earlier in the year, which is helping to subdue import prices. Furthermore, today\u2019s data suggest that \u2013 if anything \u2013 the pressures coming along the supply chain are disinflationary. This all adds up to inflation remaining close to 1\u00bd% over the second half of the year.\u201d The game of predicting when the Bank of England might raise interest rates took another spin, with economists explained that the fall in inflation makes a pre-Christmas hike less likely. Here\u2019s our news story: UK inflation fall to 1.6% lessens likelihood of interest rate rise Echoing that theory, the pound tumbled on the news, shedding almost a whole cent against the US dollar to a four-month low $1.6633. Andy Scott, spokesperson for FX advisory services at foreign currency specialists, HiFX, explains: \u201cDespite the economy growing at its fastest pace in several years and unemployment falling to its lowest level since the end of 2008, employees are receiving wage increases below the current rate of inflation, resulting in a squeeze on annual earnings in real terms. This indicates that there may indeed be additional slack in the labour market that needs to be used up in order for pay to keep up with inflation and gives the BoE scope to continue to keep rates on hold. Another factor that\u2019s probably winning the argument against raising rates too soon is that some of the world\u2019s major economies either contracted or saw minimal growth in the last quarter. This could weigh somewhat on the UK economy in the coming months, particularly with such a gloomy picture in the eurozone.\u201d The Retail Price Index, the wider measure of inflation, dropped slightly to 2.5% in July. That means that rail fares in England and Wales are likely to rise by 3.5% on average, and up to 5.5% in some cases, in 2015. The chancellor, though, could yet cap rises at a lower rate.... The ONS also reported that UK house prices hit a new record high in June, although the pace of growth moderated. 2014 was meant to be the year when real UK wages started growing, and interest rates rose. But it\u2019s not working out that way. Our economics editor, Larry Elliott, writes: Even with July\u2019s drop in inflation [to 1.6%], prices are still rising faster than earnings, which are going up at an annual rate of 0.6%. At the start of the year there was a lot of talk about how 2014 was going to be the year of the pay rise. That now looks unlikely. Living standards will carry on falling deep into the autumn even if wages do start to pick up. Some City analysts think 2014 will also be the year of the interest rate rise. That, too, is starting to look questionable given not just the weakness of CPI inflation but also the lack of any real price pressure in the pipeline. The producer prices index, a guide to the costs paid by manufacturers and the price of goods leaving factory gates, shows that the drop in fuel and raw material costs together with tight control of pay is allowing firms to cut tariff prices. An interest rate rise by the end of the year \u2013 November being the likeliest date \u2013 should not be ruled out, but it will be on the basis of what the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee thinks is going to happen to inflation rather than what is actually happening. More here: UK inflation figures - say goodbye to your pay rise Today\u2019s inflation figures have been grasped by both sides of the political spectrum. The Treasury claims that today\u2019s fall in the Consumer Prices Index, from 1.9% to 1.6%, is a sign that its policies are bearing fruit. A spokesperson said: \u201cThe government\u2019s long term economic plan is working, with today marking the 7th consecutive month that inflation has been below the Bank of England\u2019s two per cent target. \u201cBut the effects of the great recession are still being felt and so we have taken continued action to help with the cost of living, including cutting income tax, freezing fuel duty and reducing the costs of childcare. The job is not yet done so the government will go on making the realistic assessment of what needs to be done to deliver a brighter economic future\u201d Liberal Democrat Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Danny Alexander, told Sky News: \u201cThe fact that inflation has been below the Bank of England target for seven consecutive months shows that subdued inflation is now becoming the norm as the economy recovers. \u201cEliminating the deficit fairly, and repairing the UK economy remains central to the role of Liberal Democrats in Government. \u201cThese encouraging inflation numbers should give businesses the confidence they need to deliver the investment required to boost productivity. Rising productivity is the only route to sustainable increases in living standards.\u201d The opposition Labour party, meanwhile, points out that real incomes are still shrinking. Cathy Jamieson MP, Shadow Treasury Minister, says: \u201cWhile this fall in the rate of inflation is welcome, the squeeze on working people continues. \u201cThe latest figures show regular pay rising by just 0.6 per cent - less than half the rate of inflation announced today. Wages after inflation have now fallen by over \u00a31,600 a year under this government. \u201cLabour\u2019s economic plan will deal with the cost-of-living crisis, make Britain better off and earn our way to higher living standards for all, not just a few.\u201d Our Money editor Patrick Collinson has hit the phones, and confirms that rail fare rises in 2014 could be lower than the 3.5% that is widely expected. As flagged up in my last post, it\u2019s all down to George Osborne.... Over to Patrick: This morning virtually every story on rail fares is assuming that prices for \u2018regulated\u2019 fares will rise by 3.5% from next year, using the formula of July\u2019s RPI figure plus 1%. But there is absolutely no guarantee that will be the outcome. In the autumn statement last year, the Chancellor cancelled the RPI+1% increase scheduled for January 2014, replacing it with just a straightforward RPI increase. What will happen in January 2015? We know that the RPI figure will be used - but whether it will be +1% or zero, or something else, is for now speculative. This morning, a Department for Transport spokesman said: \u201cNo decisions on fare rises for 2015 have yet been taken. We understand people\u2019s concerns about the cost of travel and the impact this has on family budgets. That is why for 2014 we reduced average fare rises to RPI plus 0% for the first time in a decade.\u201d The reality is that the DfT do not know precisely when a decision will be taken on the level of increases for 2015, as it is ultimately a Treasury decision. In this year\u2019s pre-election autumn statement, the chancellor could rule out inflation-plus increases, switch to the CPI measure used for welfare benefits, or even revert to the formula used in the years immediately after rail privatisation, when fares went up by RPI minus 1%. That would be a popular move, especially with Britons heading to the polling booths in May 2015.... One point to flag up... George Osborne could offer Britain\u2019s rail travellers a reprieve from these hefty price rises in 2015. Last autumn, the chancellor capped average regulated fare increases at RPI, rather than RPI + 1% (up to RPI +3 for some fares). Potentially, Osborne could extend this freeze for another year... We\u2019re collecting expert reaction to today\u2019s inflation data here: UK inflation - what the economists say Food prices fell a little between July and June, led by bread &amp; cereals and sugar, jam, syrups, chocolate &amp; confectionery. That\u2019s due to the ongoing price wars between major supermarkets, as established chains try to battle Aldi and Lidl. Mark Billige, managing Partner at pricing experts Simon-Kucher &amp; Partners, explains: Whilst lower grocery prices are good news for consumers, they will be putting the margins of supermarkets and their suppliers under enormous pressure with a knock on effect on share prices. We expect this trend to continue as the discounters continue increasing their market share.\u201d Alasdair Cavalla, economist at the CEBR, agrees that UK interest rates are unlikely to rise this year: A long stretch of below-target inflation increases the likelihood that the Bank of England will raise interest rates in early 2015 rather than this year. Spare capacity, which is the Bank\u2019s stated guiding factor in its decision, is remaining higher for longer than expected. Cavalla points out that price growth is weak across the global economy: The Eurozone has been falling ever closer to deflation, while the European Central Bank is facing strong Bundesbank opposition to any monetary loosening measures. US inflation data come out later today, but at just 2.1% on the latest reading and expected to be at 2.0% today, the rate is already below the long-term average. In addition, a strong pound means that the UK economy finds imported goods even cheaper. Therefore, recent signals suggest the Bank seems likely to wait until next year before raising the base rate. The Bank of England a good excuse to keep its hands off the interest rate-raising lever until the new year, says Jake Trask, corporate dealer at UKForex. With dovish comments from BoE Governor Mark Carney last week, this fall in inflation will provide the MPC with even more reason to hold out for Q1 2015 before tightening monetary policy. We may learn more tomorrow about the intended timeframe for a rate hike when the minutes of the latest MPC meeting are released.\u201d Here\u2019s transport correspondent Gwyn Topham on the implications of today\u2019s inflation data for rail passengers: Rail fares will rise by an average of 3.5% in January with some fares rising by up to 5.5%, adding hundreds of pounds to the cost of season tickets. Labour and transport campaigners are stepping up their challenge to the railway system, with protests taking place at stations across the country as the extent of planned fare rises for 2015 is revealed. Campaigners have demanded action to tackle above-inflation fare increases, pointing out that ticket prices are rising nearly four times faster than wages and average fares will have risen 25% under the coalition government. Regulated train fares are pegged to July\u2019s retail price inflation figure of 2.5% and capped at RPI+1% \u2013 although train operators may raise fares on some routes by an extra 2%. The flex rule means some fares could rise by 5.5% \u2013 and could add more than \u00a3300 to the cost of annual season tickets on the most expensive commuter routes. Cumulatively, prices will have gone up almost 25% during the current parliament, while average wages have risen by 6.9%. According to the Campaign for Better Transport commuters are spending up to a fifth of their income on season tickets. More here: Rail fares to rise by average of 3.5% in January I believe, though, that Scottish fares will rise by just 2.5% -- control of rail north of the border has been devolved to the Scottish government. Britain\u2019s double-digit house price inflation (see last entry) is a blow to those hoping to get into the housing ladder. Campbell Robb, the chief executive of housing charity Shelter, has urged the government to do more: \u201cToday\u2019s house price hike is yet another blow for people across the country desperate to put down roots and create a stable home. \u201cNo matter how hard people work or save, millions are being priced out of a home of their own, caught in the \u2018rent trap\u2019 and constantly moving from one expensive property to the next. \u201cThe only solution is for politicians to roll up their sleeves and build the affordable homes we so desperately need. From a new generation of part rent part buy homes, to encouraging smaller builders back into the market, there are ways to fix this country\u2019s housing crisis.\u201cIf we don\u2019t see radical action soon, more and more people will be left without a hope of ever building a stable future in a home of their own.\u201d We also have data showing that UK house price growth slowed a little at the start of the summer. The average house price rose by 10.2% in the 12 months to June, according to the ONS. That\u2019s down from 10.4% in the year to May. It says: House price annual inflation was 10.7% in England, 3.5% in Wales, 6.0% in Scotland and 4.9% in Northern Ireland. House prices are increasing strongly across most parts of the UK, with prices in London again showing the highest growth. Average prices in the capital have surged by 19.3% over the last 12 months, and are now a staggering 35.6% higher than the pre-financial crisis peak in January 2008. But more recent data has suggested that sellers in London are now cutting prices; a sign the market may be cooling off... The inflation data is online here. There are also signs that British firms face less inflationary pressure. Producer input prices (basically, what firms pay for raw materials) dropped 1.6% month-on-month in July, and are a chunky 7.3% lower than a year ago. Output prices (what they charge for their goods) fell slightly too. The 5.7% drop in clothing prices last month came from \u201ca wide range of men\u2019s, women\u2019s and children\u2019s outerwear, for example trousers, coats and jumpers\u201d, the ONS adds. The chances of the Bank of England raising interest rates in 2014 have fallen, flags up Jeremy Cook of currency firm World First: So, why the big drop in inflation last month? The Office for National Statistics says that the biggest single factor driving CPI down to 1.6% was clothing prices, which tumbled by 5.7% between June and July. That suggests that summer clothing sales kicked off in earnest in July, after being delayed from June. Other large downward effects came from the alcohol, financial services and food &amp; non-alcoholic drinks. The ONS explains: Alcohol &amp; tobacco prices, overall, fell by 0.7% between June and July this year but rose by 0.6% a year ago. The downward effect came from a range of alcohol products, principally spirits and wine. For both groups, prices fell this year but rose a year ago. But transport costs rose, by 1.3% between June and July. The pound has taken a tumble as City traders react to the larger-than-expected fall in inflation last month. It\u2019s down 0.5%, or 0.8 of a cent, at $1.665, as the guessing game of when the Bank of England will raise interest rates takes another twist. Here\u2019s some instant reaction to the news that the headline UK inflation rate fell by more than expected in July: The Retail Prices Index, a broader measure of inflation, has also fallen, to 2.5% in July. That means average rail fares will rise by 3.5% next year, under the government\u2019s RPI +1% formula. But rail operators are allowed to raise some fares by as much as RPI +3%, meaning some unlucky commuters face paying 5.5% extra in 2015. Breaking: The UK consumer prices index has tumbled to 1.6% in July, a sharp fall on June\u2019s 1.9%. That should bring some relief to households, and also takes inflation further away from the Bank of England\u2019s target of 2% inflation. But prices are still rising almost three times faster than wages --- average earnings in the UK rose by just 0.6% in the April-June quarter, according to the latest data. Lots more detail and reaction to follow.... The pound just fell against the US dollar, down 0.3 of a cent at $1.6694. Does that mean someone is anticipating a weak inflation reading in a few minutes time?.... Nearly time for the UK inflation data for July. As flagged up earlier, economists expect the UK Consumer Prices Index to have fallen a little, to 1.8% from 1.9% in June. Britain currently has the highest inflation rate in Europe, with several members of the eurozone experiencing falling prices. European stock markets are showing small gains across the board, as hopes of easing geopolitical tensions cheer the City. The FTSE 100 has gained 0.5%, or 33 points, to 6775, despite BHP Billiton (-3.5%) dragging down the index as its demerger plans sink in. Germany\u2019s DAX has gained 1%, on hopes that Russia and Ukraine may reach an agreement to end the long-running, deadly clashes on their borders. The French CAC is up 0.44%. The Footsie being led by housebuilder Barratt Developments - which may be benefitting from strong results from rival Persimmon this morning. Persimmon, which builds homes outside the M25, reported a 57% jump in profits for the first half of 2014. The firm said the \u201congoing improvement in the UK\u2019s economic performance\u201d was helping the sector, and claimed there was \u201clittle sign\u201d of fatigue, despite recent signs that mortgage lending may be cooling off. Full story here. Rumours of a pact between the Bank of England and the UK Treasury to resist raising interest rates until after next May\u2019s general election refuse to go away. City AM reports that the Treasury committee will ask governor Mark Carney about his relationship with George Osborne, after two MPs raised concerns over the closeness of their relationship. The BoE and the Treasury have tried to rubbish talk of a secret pact. But as committee member Mark Garniere explained, this speculation could be damaging: \u201cThe Bank of England has to act independently, otherwise the whole thing becomes farcical \u2013 you get back to the worst case scenario where the chancellor is deciding rates covertly.... \u201cThe Treasury committee is very cognisant of this kind of risk.\u201d Overnight, a former trader at Dutch bank Rabobank became the first Britain to plead guilty to charges over the Libor scandal. Paul Robson had been accused of taking part in a scheme to manipulate the \u201cyen Libor rate\u201d - a benchmark rate at which banks would lend to each other. The US justice department said Robson had pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and bank fraud. Leslie Caldwell, who heads the Justice Department\u2019s criminal division, said: \u201cThe scope of the fraud was massive, but the scheme was simple. By illegally influencing the Libor rates, Robson and his co-conspirators rigged the markets to ensure that their trades made money.\u201d Robson is the second Rabobank trader to plead guilty following probes into the alleged manipulation of interest rate benchmarks. More here: Ex-Rabobank trader second to plead guilty to Libor rigging Shares in BHP Billiton, the Anglo-Australian mining giant, have promptly dropped by 3% in early trading after it announced plans to spin off its aluminium, coal, manganese, nickel and silver assets into a new company. It\u2019s a massive demerger -- which appears to unpick much of the deal that created the group in 2001. Jac Nasser, BHP chairman, says the deal will \u201cprovide investors with choice and unlock value in both companies.\u201d Rail campaigners have already warned that fares are rising too fast, even before today\u2019s inflation data is released. The Campaign for Better Transport argues that the \u201cRetail Prices Index +1%\u201d formula (or RPI + 3% for some fares) needs to change, as some commuters could pay an extra \u00a3300 each next year. Spokesman Martin Abrams isn\u2019t impressed that some fares could rise by around 5.6% (depending on today\u2019s data, of course!): \u201cWith people\u2019s wages stagnating, and in some cases falling, the expense of taking the train to work has become a huge part of living costs. If the government doesn\u2019t put an end to above-inflation fare increases quickly, ordinary commuters will be priced off the train and could be forced into agonising decisions such as moving house or quitting their jobs\u201d More here: Labour and transport campaigners step up rail fares fight as prices rise again Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, business and the eurozone. Inflation is high on the agenda, with new surveys showing the cost of living in Britain and America due out today. The UK\u2019s Consumer Prices Index index is expected to fall a little, after spiking unexpectedly last month. Economists predict CPI will dip to 1.8% in July, from 1.9%, at 9.30am. That would mean prices were running three times faster than average wages (which rose just 0.6% in the three months to June). Cue plenty more justifiable concern that the UK recovery hasn\u2019t reached workers\u2019 pockets. Today\u2019s inflation data is particularly important for UK commuters, as the wider Retail Prices Index will be used to calculate next year\u2019s rail fare increases. RPI is expected to be unchanged at 2.6%. Rail operators are allowed to increase fares by an average of RPI + 1%. But under a \u201cflex\u201d rule, train companies can raise some fares by another 2% above the average, as long as they make cuts elsewhere. So some passengers could face an inflation-busting 5.6% increase, even if the service isn\u2019t that much better.... America\u2019s July inflation data is due at 1.30pm BST (8.30am New York), and is also expected to show a slight drop. That could reduce the pressure on the US Federal Reserve to start raising interest rates, as it comes to the end of its bond-buying stimulus programme. CMC Market\u2019s Michael Hewson explains: In the afternoon session we also get the latest US CPI inflation numbers and they are expected to slip slightly from the 2.1% in June to 2% in July. A similarly weak number would undermine the recent rise in the US dollar as markets bet that rates are likely to remain lower for longer. In the corporate world, mining giant BHP Billiton has just announced plans to spin off many of its operations into a new \u201cGlobal Metals and Mining Company\u201d. More on that shortly. Stock markets are expected to continue where they stopped yesterday, rising on hopes that the Ukraine crisis is easing. Last night, the US Nasdaq index hit its highest closing level in 14 years (a peak that was swiftly followed by the dot-com crash....). And in the City, building firm Persimmon has reported that demand in the housing market remains strong after a leap in profits. I\u2019ll be tracking the main developments through the day.",

The US Department of Justice said in October it would investigate a major clinical trial used to win marketing approval for the treatment, but on Tuesday it said no further action was planned. Brilinta was one of the drugs whose prospects AstraZeneca highlighted in its defence against the Pfizer bid. Chief executive Pascal Soriot said:</p> <blockquote> We have always had absolute confidence in the integrity of the ....trial. As one of AstraZeneca's growth platforms, we are committed to delivering the full potential of this important medicine. </blockquote> <p>AstraZeneca added 37p to 4238.5p.</p> <p>Overall markets moved higher again on hopes of easing geopolitical tensions, and amid inflation figures from both sides of the Atlantic which suggested there was unlikely to be any rise in UK or US interest rates in the near future.

      "bodyText": "AstraZeneca shares have fallen sharply since the pharmaceuticals company rebuffed a $118bn offer from US group Pfizer in May. But ahead of a possible return by Pfizer later this month - in the unlikely event of being invited by AstraZeneca to bid again - there was good news for the UK company as US regulators closed a probe into its new heart drug Brilinta. The US Department of Justice said in October it would investigate a major clinical trial used to win marketing approval for the treatment, but on Tuesday it said no further action was planned. Brilinta was one of the drugs whose prospects AstraZeneca highlighted in its defence against the Pfizer bid. Chief executive Pascal Soriot said: We have always had absolute confidence in the integrity of the ....trial. As one of AstraZeneca's growth platforms, we are committed to delivering the full potential of this important medicine. AstraZeneca added 37p to 4238.5p. Overall markets moved higher again on hopes of easing geopolitical tensions, and amid inflation figures from both sides of the Atlantic which suggested there was unlikely to be any rise in UK or US interest rates in the near future. But stronger than expected US housing starts muddied the picture a little. Wednesday's Bank of England minutes should provide further clues as to the central bank's thinking, while later in the week come speeches from Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen and ECB boss Mario Draghi at latest Jackson Hole meeting in Wyoming. Ahead of all that, the FTSE 100 finished up 38.06 points at 6779.31 - a three week high - while German and French markets also gained ground. On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 60 points by the time London closed. Barratt Developments was 10.4p better at 368.6p after positive results from rival housebuilder Persimmon, up 15p at \u00a313.50. These further signs of an improvement in the UK housing market helped lift Kingfisher, owner of the B&amp;Q DIY chain, by 11.2p to 310.6p. Elsewhere Imperial Tobacco added 59p to \u00a325.85 after it said it expected modest growth in full year earnings following an improvement in the European market. But it saw a deterioration in Russian sales as well as the impact of turbulence in the Middle East, notably in Iraq of course. But CRH lost 28p to \u00a314.28 despite the Irish building supplies company returned to profit in the first six months. Mining group BHP Billiton fell 102p to \u00a319.65 as it said it would spin off some $14bn worth of assets - including aluminium, manganese and some nickel and coal - into an as yet unnamed company, effectively undoing much of the 2001 merger between BHP and Billiton. The fall reflected disappointment with investors receiving shares in the new company listed in Australia and South Africa, the lack of a buyback and an underwhelming 8% rise in second half profits. Among the mid-caps, Ophir Energy jumped 15.2p to 229.6p on talk of possible US bid interest at 350p a share. There was also takeover speculation surrounding building materials suppler SIG, up 5.3p at 183p. Energy services company Wood Group rose 37p to 788.5p despite first half earnings which were virtually flat at $243.9m. However the company said it expected a rise for the full year helped by progress in its production services division, PSN. Its shale projects fall mainly within PSN, which accounts for around 60% of total revenue. Mears, the social housing and care specialist, slipped 8.5p to 484.75p even though half year profits grew 11% to \u00a318.7m. Contracts worth \u00a3200m were won during the period, but its order book dipped from \u00a33.8bn to \u00a33.7bn after changes in housing finance and welfare reforms led to a short term delay in new bidding opportunities.

      "bodyText": "Imperial Tobacco, the world's fourth-largest cigarette company, has been hit by weaker sales in Russia and unrest in the Middle East. The maker of Davidoff and Gauloises cigarettes blamed tough conditions in a number of its key markets, highlighting \"a significant deterioration in the Russian market and the impact of the turbulent situation in the Middle East\". Russians are among the heaviest smokers in the world \u2013 with around 400,000 people dying of smoking-related diseases each year according to official figures \u2013 but the government has been clamping down on the habit. A ban on smoking in bars and restaurants came into force in June, as well as restrictions on selling cigarettes on street kiosks. At the same time, Imperial has been hit by unrest in the Middle East, as suppliers struggle to deliver cigarettes in Iraq and Syria. Imperial said its markets are shrinking by around 4% a year, although some of its best-selling brands continue to grow. Total sales continue to decline in Europe, as smoking bans and graphic health warnings contribute to a decline in the number of smokers, but Imperial said it had seen \"a modest deceleration in the rate of market decline in parts of Europe\". Imperial Tobacco reported a 1% fall in revenue to \u00a34.8bn for the nine months to the end of June, as it was hit by adverse swings in foreign exchange. The company is only the latest FTSE 100 member with a global business to feel the strong pound weighing on profits \u2013 rival British American Tobacco reported last month that profits were down 9% on currency fluctuations. In a trading statement, Imperial also promised to update shareholders on the $7.1bn (\u00a34.3bn) deal it struck last month to buy American cigarette brands, including Winston, Maverick and blu e-cigarettes, from two US tobacco companies, Lorillard and Reynolds, who are merging. The deal, which is expected to be complete in 2015, will catapult Bristol-based Imperial into the No 3 spot in the US market. Imperial launched its first e-cigarette in Britain this year \u2013 a device named Puritane that is made by its subsidiary Fontem Ventures and sold in pharmacists. The arrival of big tobacco companies into the e-cigarette market has alarmed health campaigners who fear the devices \"renormalise\" smoking rather than help people quit. More than 100 public health experts recently urged the World Health Organisation to bring e-cigarettes under the same tight controls as tobacco products, with bans on advertising and promotion.",

      "bodyText": "The City was surprised by the fall in the annual inflation rate to 1.6%. It shouldn't have been since the explanation was simple: the summer sales came late this year. Clothing and footwear retailers cut their prices by 5.7% in July, a heftier discount than the 3.2% in July 2013. By contrast, Primark, Topshop, Kurt Geiger and all the other big names of the high street cut their prices by less this June than they did in the same month of 2013. As a result, inflation was a bit higher than might have been expected in June but a bit lower in July. The annual increase in the cost of living as measured by the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) has settled in a narrow range just below the government's 2% target; in the past seven months it has never been higher than 1.9% and never lower than 1.6%. Even with July's drop in inflation, prices are still rising faster than earnings, which are going up at an annual rate of 0.6%. At the start of the year there was a lot of talk about how 2014 was going to be the year of the pay rise. That now looks unlikely. Living standards will carry on falling deep into the autumn even if wages do start to pick up. Some City analysts think 2014 will also be the year of the interest rate rise. That, too, is starting to look questionable given not just the weakness of CPI inflation but also the lack of any real price pressure in the pipeline. The producer prices index, a guide to the costs paid by manufacturers and the price of goods leaving factory gates, shows that the drop in fuel and raw material costs together with tight control of pay is allowing firms to cut tariff prices. An interest rate rise by the end of the year \u2013 November being the likeliest date \u2013 should not be ruled out, but it will be on the basis of what the Bank of England's monetary policy committee thinks is going to happen to inflation rather than what is actually happening. Inflation is below target; earnings are going up by just 0.6% on average; oil prices are falling; a strong pound is reducing the cost of imports. Nothing there to get the alarm bells ringing. The sting in the tail from the inflation figures is that rail travellers could see fares rise by an average of 3.5% in the New Year. That's because the government's formula, suspended by George Osborne for 2014, is for fares to go up by one percentage point more than inflation as measured by the July Retail Prices Index, which stood at 2.5%. Note how the government uses the RPI -\u2013 no longer thought reliable enough to be considered an official statistic by the ONS \u2013 as the yardstick for rail fares but the lower CPI to uprate benefits and pensions.

      "bodyText": "The UK's annual inflation rate fell more sharply than expected in July, dimming the prospects of an interest rate rise in 2014. The consumer prices index fell to 1.6% from 1.9% in June, marking the seventh month in a row that annual inflation has registered below the Bank of England's 2% target, according to Office for National Statistics data. Economists had expected a smaller fall to 1.8%. The larger-than-expected drop was driven mainly by greater summer price discounting among clothing retailers than is usual at this time of year. Clothing and footwear prices fell by 5.7% between June and July, compared with a smaller fall of 3.2% during the same period last year. Prices were slashed on a wide range of items, including trousers, coats and jumpers. Alcohol prices, the cost of some financial services including bank overdraft charges, and food also contributed to the fall. A Treasury spokesman gave credit for the fall in inflation to the government. \"The government's long-term economic plan is working, with today marking the seventh consecutive month that inflation has been below the Bank of England's two per cent target. \"But the effects of the great recession are still being felt and so we have taken continued action to help with the cost of living, including cutting income tax, freezing fuel duty and reducing the costs of childcare. The job is not yet done so the government will go on making the realistic assessment of what needs to be done to deliver a brighter economic future.\" The news was not all good for consumers, who face average rail fare rises of 3.5% in 2015. The July inflation rate on the retail prices index (RPI) measure is used to calculate rail fare rises, and dropped to 2.5% last month from 2.6% in June. Increases are traditionally capped at RPI+1% \u2013 although train operators may raise fares on some routes by an extra 2%. That means some rail fares could increase by up to 5.5%. Mark Carney, the Bank of England governor, has given mixed messages in recent weeks on the likely timing of a first increase in interest rates, which have left been on hold at 0.5% since March 2009. Economists said lack of inflationary pressure in the UK, coupled with weak wage growth, made a rate hike in 2014 less likely. James Knightley, economist at ING, said: \"On the face of it this supports an on-hold stance from the Bank of England. The combination of sterling strength (making imported goods cheaper), along with weak wage growth and lower energy prices, which are limiting business cost growth, means inflation looks set to remain contained for now. \"This further eases the pressure on the Bank of England to consider near-term interest rate rises and pushes the balance more in favour of a delay to rate hikes versus our current November official view for the first policy tightening move.\" Despite below target inflation, household budgets remain under pressure because wage growth has lagged behind the inflation rate for the vast majority over the past six years. Pay growth including bonuses fell by 0.2% between April and June compared with a year earlier. Stripping out bonuses, pay was 0.6% \u2013 less than a third of June's 1.9% inflation rate. Cathy Jamieson, Labour's shadow Treasury minister, said: \"While this fall in the rate of inflation is welcome, the squeeze on working people continues.\" The pound fell against the dollar and the euro after the July data was published, as investors interpreted it as a sign that rates would stay on hold into 2015. The pound fell to $1.6634, its lowest in more than eight months, while the euro rose 0.4% to 80.25p.",

In a well-trailed move, Australia\u2019s biggest company also announced on Tuesday that it will create an independent metals and mining company from its aluminium, metallurgical coal, manganese, nickel and silver assets. It said the planned demerger would unlock shareholder value by rationalising the group\u2019s structure. The simplified company would then focus on its huge iron ore, copper, coal, oil and potash assets where it would be able to reduce costs and improve productivity. The spin-off company will be based in Perth and led by current BHP board member David Crawford as chairman and current BHP finance chief Graham Kerr as chief executive. Announcing the changes, group chairman Jac Nasser, said: \u201cFor over a century, BHP Billiton has progressively reshaped its business to maintain its industry leadership. We believe the proposed demerger, if implemented, will accelerate the simplification of the group\u2019s portfolio, provide investors with choice and unlock value in both companies. \u201cOur shareholders will have the opportunity to vote on this proposal once the necessary approvals are in place.\u201d The so-called \u201cNewCo\u201d would have assets including BHP\u2019s aluminium and manganese businesses, Cerro Matoso Nickel, Energy Coal South Africa, Illawarra Metallurgical Coal and Cannington Silver-Lead-Zinc mines. BHP shareholders would be entitled to 100% of the shares in NewCo on a pro-rata basis and would be listed on the Australian Securities Exchange with a secondary listing on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange.",
