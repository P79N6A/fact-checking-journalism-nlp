      "bodyText": "The FTSE 100 has reached a new closing high after an impasse in the latest round of Brexit talks triggered a sell-off of the pound. The stock market made up of the UK\u2019s biggest companies closed up 22 points (0.3%) at 7556.24. The rise reflected the weaker pound, which makes British goods and services cheaper abroad and tends to increase the share price of multinational companies with a large proportion of foreign earnings. At one point, the pound was down as much as one cent against the dollar at $1.3123, after the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, said talks over Britain\u2019s divorce bill were in a \u201cvery disturbing state of deadlock\u201d. Currency traders reacted swiftly to the lack of progress, also sending sterling down to a four-week low against the euro at \u20ac1.109, although the pound later recovered after markets closed. Multinational exporters were among the FTSE 100\u2019s biggest risers on Thursday, with Burberry gaining 2.7% and Unilever up 2.1%. Energy companies also helped push the index to the record closing high. SSE and Centrica, two of Britain\u2019s biggest providers, gained 2.5% and 1.9% respectively after it emerged that the government\u2019s price cap was unlikely to come into effect until 2019. Analysts said the high on Thursday was not a vote of confidence in the UK economy. \u201cThe bullish move was achieved for the wrong reasons, as the dip in the pound on the back of the stalled Brexit talks helped the British index,\u201d said David Madden of CMC Markets. Joshua Mahony, a market analyst at IG, said: \u201cThe continued ascent of the FTSE has had much to do with the negative effect of the disjointed Brexit negotiations, with daily updates seemingly highlighting just how unsuccessful the initial rounds of talks have been.\u201d The FTSE\u2019s showing beat its previous closing high of 7,547 points in June, but was below the record intraday high of 7,598.99. Laith Khalaf, a senior analyst at the financial services group Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \u201cThe UK stock market continues its winning streak despite concerns over economic performance and the unfolding Brexit process. The question is whether the market\u2019s strong run means it\u2019s fit to burst. \u201cFactoring in earnings, from where we\u2019re sitting, valuations in the UK stock market look reasonable, neither particularly cheap nor particularly expensive. That means in the short term the stock market can turn in either direction without defying the laws of statistics.\u201d The FTSE 250 also reached a record closing high on Thursday, up 0.4% at 20,251.24. The index comprises medium-sized companies that are not large enough to make it into the FTSE 100, and tend to be more focused on the UK market. Neil Wilson, a senior market analyst at ETX Capital, said the FTSE 250\u2019s figure reflected a wider appetite among investors to buy equities. \u201cThe FTSE 250 is also at a high and I think this is a sign of a broader risk-on attitude across global markets that has pushed Germany\u2019s Dax and America\u2019s Dow to new records,\u201d he said. The Dow Jones index in the US also hit a record high of 22,884.00, but later dropped back.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all for tonight, as City traders catch a breather after another busy day. Here\u2019s a brief recap of the main events. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 has closed at a new record high. The index of the biggest companies listed on the London stock market closed at 7,556, a gain of 0.3% today. The pound has had a volatile day, as Brexit developments continued to buffet the currency. Sterling tumbled to a four-week low against the euro after the EU\u2019s top negotiator warned that talks have hit deadlock. But...the pound is staging a surprise rally tonight, on reports that Brussels might be open to a two-year transition deal. The Financial Times has got hold of the draft conclusions of the upcoming EU summit, which show that leaders plan to approve internal discussions on a post-Brexit relationship with the UK. The FT says: It [the draft] suggests EU leaders will \u201creassess the state of progress\u201d at a summit in December, and if sufficient progress is made, adopt additional guidelines for EU negotiators on a transition and future trade relations with the UK. In a recognition of the progress made so far, the EU will attempt to be \u201cfully ready for this scenario\u201d by inviting Michel Barnier, its chief negotiator, to \u201cstart internal preparatory discussions\u201d on a transition and the future relationship. This has helped the pound to surge back again tonight.... Earlier, IMF chief Christine Lagarde said she couldn\u2019t imagine how Britain could leave the EU without a deal. She warned that WTO rules wouldn\u2019t provide protection for EU citizens in the UK, or Britons abroad, or give airlines the ability to keep flying back and forth. Back in the UK, the Bank of England has flagged up that lenders are planning to cut back on consume credit availability. A new report also found that default rates on credit cards etc are rising. There are also fresh signs that the UK housing market is slowing. Chartered surveyors have reported that sales and prices are cooling, with London worst affected. It could provide some much-needed help to those trying to get onto the housing ladder... That\u2019s all for tonight. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW The US stock market is continuing to rally tonight too; the S&amp;P 500 just hit a new alltime high. Bitcoin is also surging in value tonight. The digital currency just hit $5,388, which means it has gained more than 10% in just one day. Jordan Hiscott, chief trader at ayondo markets, says Bitcoin continues to defy those who have claimed it will crash. Confounding many financial experts, including Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, Bitcoin has reached a new all-time high of $5,233, with robust speculative demand seen on the move through $5,000. The cryptocurrency success story continues, albeit for now, but just as an idea for basis, the asset is up 425% since the start of the year. \u201cThe returns are truly remarkable, especially given the recent ban on Bitcoin trading in China, where demand had previously accounted for at least 10% of all global volumes.\u201d Mystery solved.... Hello..... the pound has suddenly reversed today\u2019s losses, and is now slightly HIGHER against the US dollar for the day. I can\u2019t immediately see why..... Readers may be looking at the FTSE 100 and wondering if they should be buying shares, or selling up. I\u201dm certainly not giving any investment advice. So instead, here\u2019s Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at financial services group Hargreaves Lansdown. Factoring in earnings, from where we\u2019re sitting valuations in the UK stock market look reasonable, neither particularly cheap, nor particularly expensive. That means in the short term the stock market can turn in either direction without defying the laws of statistics. However there are some reasons to be positive. The global economy, driven by its largest contributor the US, is picking up, with even Europe seeing a renaissance. Interest rates remain low and the UK consumer remains resilient. Meanwhile in an environment where doom and gloom pervades market sentiment, any positive surprises could go a long way to boosting stock prices. Khalaf also points out that the alternatives to the stock market aren\u2019t too attractive, with interest rates at record lows. Property is also expensives -- and we saw this morning that chartered surveyors expect prices to fall in London in the coming months. Khalaf concludes: For long term investors the immediate direction of the stock market is of limited importance in any case, as what ultimately determines your wealth are the scores on the doors when you come to draw on your investment. History tells us that over a long time period, the stock market really comes into its own.\u2019 Britain\u2019s FTSE 250 index has also hit a record closing high. The FTSE 250 contains medium-sized companies that aren\u2019t big enough to make it into the FTSE 100, so is seen as a better gauge of the UK economy. As it happens, today is the 25th anniversary of the FTSE 250\u2019s creation. Back in 1992, the FTSE 250 was worth \u00a398bn. It\u2019s now more than quadrupled to over \u00a3450bn in 2017 this year Energy companies also helped to push the FTSE 100 to tonight\u2019s record peak. Centrica and SSE, two of Britain\u2019s biggest energy providers, both gained 2%, after it emerged that the government\u2019s new price cap probably won\u2019t come into effect until 2019. Boom! Britain\u2019s blue-chip stock market has hit a new all-time closing high. The FTSE 100 has closed at 7556.24 points, up 22 points or 0.3%. Multinational exporters led the rally, with luxury fashion chain Burberry gaining 2.6% and consumer goods group Unilever rising by around 2%. They will benefit from the drop in the pound today to a one-month low against the euro (see earlier post). This beats the FTSE 100\u2019s previous closing high of 7,547 points set in June, but is still below the record intraday high of 7,598.99. The rally was sparked by the fall in the pound this lunchtime, after the EU\u2019s chief negotiator warned that Brexit talks were deadlocked. A weaker sterling typically pushes up shares price in London, particularly for companies who make most of their money overseas. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, says: The continued ascent of the FTSE has had much to do with the negative effect of the disjointed Brexit negotiations, with daily updates seemingly highlighting just how unsuccessful the initial rounds of talks have been. The current \u2018deadlock\u2019 shows little signs of being broken, with both sides unwilling to budge in their stance and combative positions. As time ticks on, the chance of a hard Brexit are heightened. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, adds: The [FTSE 100\u2019s] bullish move was achieved for the wrong reasons, as the dip in the pound on the back of the stalled Brexit talks helped the British index. The FTSE 100\u2019s rally is also part of a wider surge in global equities. MSCI\u2019s All Country index has hit several record highs in recent weeks, as has America\u2019s Dow Jones industrial average and S&amp;P 500 In fact, as I type, the Dow has just hit a new record - 22,872 points. It\u2019s gained almost 25% in the last year. Brexit uncertainty isn\u2019t hurting Germany\u2019s stock market. The DAX index, which contains the country\u2019s largest companies, has just hit its highest-ever level. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 could yet close at its highest ever level too, thanks to the drop in the pound today (as explained earlier) Q: What would be the economic impact on Europe if Britain left the European Union without a deal? Christine Lagarde says she \u201cjust cannot imagine\u201d that the UK would simply default to WTO rules after leaving the EU, because it would create so much disruption. What would it mean for the people themselves, she asks. For the Europeans residing in the UK, the British living in Europe? WTO rules do not cover this. She also points to airline landing rights as another area where WTO rules don\u2019t apply [yesterday, Chancellor Philip Hammond suggested flights between the UK and EU could simply stop after Brexit] Lagarde that this means a deal must be reached, as: There is so much that has been brought together between the continent and the United Kingdom that it requires a very specific approach to reduce the uncertainty that is damaging [economic] potential. Lagarde is asked about yesterday\u2019s Fiscal Monitor, which argued that countries could raise taxes on the rich without hurting growth. Q: Is this the best way to reduce inequality? No, Lagarde replies. The most efficient way to reduce inequalities is to close the gender gap between men and women. But yes, the Fiscal Monitor did show that taxes on the rich could be higher without damaging economic growth. Lagarde has also dropped a heavy hint against trade protectionism. Asked about Europe, Lagarde says it will be a \u201cgrowth leader\u201d. Earlier this week the Fund raised its growth forecasts for the eurozone (but not for the UK) On Brexit, Christine Lagarde says Britain and Brussels need to provide more clarity and certainty. She tells the IMF press conference in Washington that she hopes the negotiations can be concluded promptly. It is important to reduce the uncertainty that is worrying people, and put \u201cpeople first and business second\u201d. Lagarde says she doesn\u2019t know if the two-year transition period proposed by Theresa May in Florence will be agreed. But she certainly believes that \u201cclarity on the timetable\u201d and \u201cmore certainty\u201d on the three pillars of the agreement would help. [Those pillars are Britain\u2019s exit bill, how citizens rights will be protected, and how the Irish border will be managed after Brexit]. Q: Are you concerned that United States might withdraw from the NAFTA agreement? Would it be a Brexit-style event? Lagarde says the Nafta talks are underway, so she doesn\u2019t want to comment directly on it. She also doesn\u2019t put it in the same category as Brexit. She argues that it\u2019s not unusual to \u2018look under the skin\u2019 of an agreement that has lasted for 20 years, given the changes seen in the last two decades. On China, Lagarde welcomes recent moves by the Chinese central bank to reduce credit, to avoid an explosion of bad debt. The continued reining in of credit in China, to control financial risks, would be \u2018most welcome\u2019 she adds. Christine Lagarde points to Fintech as an opportunity. There are \u201call sorts of financial innovation and disruptions\u201d she says (but she\u2019s not specifically talking about Bitcoin). She also warns that a \u2018tightening of the financial markets\u2019 could hurt emerging markets, if it sparks a capital outflow. On trade, Lagarde says a \u201cpickup of trade\u201d is fuelling growth. But rising inequality is a concern, which could hurt global growth. Christine Lagarde begins by quoting Percy Bysshe Shelley, who once declared \u201cThere is a harmony in autumn\u201d. There is also a harmony in the global economy today. Our goal is to turn that harmony into a season of action, Lagarde declares. She says the global recovery is \u201cstronger and more broadly based\u201d than before, which is why the IMF raised its growth forecasts to 3.6% this year and 3.7% in 2018. But policymakers need to take the right decisions so that more people and more countries benefit from the recovery. What does that mean? Lagarde says 1) Those with healthy economies should invest more in their own economies - including infrastructure spending, strengthening education, and helping more women into work 2) Other countries should focus on their fiscal position, and reduce debt as a percentage of GDP IMF chief Christine Lagarde is giving her press conference in Washington now, at the Fund\u2019s Annual Meeting. It\u2019s being streamed live here. My colleague Adam Vaughan has been looking into the government\u2019s pledge to cap fuel bills, and reports: The energy bills of 11m households will be capped for as long as five years under legislation put forward by government, which the Conservatives have said could save people up to \u00a3100 a year. The draft energy bill compels regulator Ofgem to change the licence conditions for energy suppliers so that they are forced to cap electricity and gas prices. The measure will apply to anyone on a standard variable tariff, the expensive plans that customers are moved to when cheaper, fixed deals end.... Here\u2019s the full story: Over in Greece officials are anxiously awaiting this afternoon\u2019s press conference by IMF chief Christine Lagarde after the Washington-based organisation predicted that the country\u2019s primary surplus in 2018 will be much lower than that forecast by the EU. Helena Smith reports from Athens With the IMF raising the spectre of further austerity measures all eyes will be on Christine Lagarde this afternoon. In its fiscal monitor report Wednesday, the Washington-based body predicted that the primary surplus will come in around 2.2% of GDP next year - well short of the 3.5% forecast by the Greek government in the draft budget it has already tabled before parliament and by the EU. There are mounting concerns in Athens - and other EU capitals - that Greece could be force to endure yet more budget cuts and tax increases to raise the extra \u20ac2.3bn or 1.3% of GDP. The figures were released as feverish preparations get underway for the official White House visit which prime minister Alexis Tsipras will make next week. Much hangs on Tsipras\u2019 talks with president Donald Trump, Greek officials say. The October 17 talks, which took many by surprise, could play a decisive role in completing the country\u2019s third and last bailout review. With the leftist-led government\u2019s setting a \u2018clean exit\u2019 from the programme \u2013 and international supervision \u2013 by the summer of 2018, a great deal depends on the stance of the IMF. Tsipras is expected to appeal to Trump to urge the organisation to show more flexibility on Greece so Athens can conclude the compliance review and ultimately fend for itself by returning to international capital markets. In return he will play up Greece\u2019s crucial geopolitical role- at a time of ever worsening relations between the West and Turkey \u2013 by signing an array of bilateral defence agreements. Before his election Trump had tweeted that he thought the Greeks \u201care wasting their time\u201d staying in the euro zone. As the largest shareholder in the IMF, with a 17% share of the body\u2019s voting power, the US has effective veto power over many of the IMF\u2019s decision. The Greek deputy defence minister Dimitris Vitsas flew to Washington at the weekend to prepare for the visit amid talk of Athens purchasing more F16 fighter jets from the US. The news that the Brexit talks have hit a \u2018very disturbing\u2019 deadlock over Britain\u2019s exit bill will not pleased the City, or the country\u2019s bosses. The lack of progress is not a great surprise, though, which explains why the pound didn\u2019t fall more sharply (a one-month low against the euro is bad enough, though). Shilen Shah, bond strategist at Investec Wealth &amp; Investment, says investors will hope for a breakthough, fast. \u201cAs expected, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator has confirmed that the EU and UK have not progressed far enough to move on to the next stage of discussions. Along with uncertainty on the future Northern Ireland/Republic of Ireland border, both sides seem to have not found an agreement on the UK\u2019s final bill. \u201cFollowing Barnier\u2019s comments Sterling has weakened, with the risk that the deadlock could become permanent. Markets are however also likely to focus on his comments that \u201cdecisive progress\u201d could be made by Christmas \u2013 limiting any sell-off in UK-related assets.\u201d Terry Scuoler, chief executive of EEF, the manufacturers\u2019 organisation, points out that firms need to know what will happen after March 2019 (when Britain\u2019s EU membership is set to cease). \u201cThe UK and EU negotiators all seem to agree that we need to move to some form of transition discussion. However, they\u2019ve yet to fully grasp the need to do this quickly if they want to avoid damaging investment and industry\u2019s prospects on both sides of the channel. \u201cBusiness is looking for clarity and a clear sign of goodwill on transitional arrangements, as it is in all our interests to ensure these are comprehensive and agreed, at least in principle, before the end of the year. The EU Council must show leadership next week and build on the Prime Minister\u2019s constructive approach set out in her speech in Florence and move quickly to protect our collective economic interests.\u201d The drop in the pound is having its usual invigorating effect on the London stock market. The FTSE 100 has gained 28 points, or 0.3%, to 7562. That means it\u2019s less than 40 points off a new record high. Shares in multinational companies listed in London usually typically rise when the pound falls, as it makes their overseas earnings more valuable in sterling terms. The pound has just dropped by half a cent against the US dollar, back below $1.32, as the Brexit negotiations continue to struggle. Over in Brussels, EU negotiator Michel Barnier told reporters that talks over Britain\u2019s divorce bill have reached deadlock, something he called \u2018very disturbing\u2019. This means that it is too early to begin discussions over Britain\u2019s future relationship with the European Union, Barnier warned. David Davis, secretary of state for leaving the EU, argued that talks have \u2018come a long way\u2019. Barnier agreed that \u2018decisive\u2019 progress could be made before Christmas. But traders reacted swiftly to the lack of progress, sending sterling down to a four-week low against the euro at \u20ac1.109. The pound also shed more than half a cent against the US dollar, to $1.315. Andy Sparrow\u2019s Politics Live blog has full details: Britain\u2019s banks have pulled a \u2018spectacular\u2019 u-turn by clamping down on credit, says Mark Dyason of the specialist lending broker, Thistle Finance. Not so long ago they were lending left, right and centre at tantalising rates, and now they are turning the taps off with similar enthusiasm. Some might accuse them of a mind-blowing myopia. For consumers, money being as cheap as it has been is a double-edged sword. Initially, it enables people to keep their heads above water but then the rates on offer can encourage households to take on more than they can manage. UK lenders have also seen a rise in customers defaulting on their debts. That\u2019s a sign that households are struggling as inflation outpaces wage growth. The Bank of England says: Default rates on credit card lending were reported to have increased slightly in Q3, while those on other unsecured lending increased significantly. A further slight increase was expected for credit card lending only in Q4. Losses given default were reported to have increased slightly on credit card lending while remaining unchanged on other unsecured lending. Both were expected to be unchanged in Q4. Any tightening of consumer credit is likely to hit spending, and thus economic growth, warns Sam Tombs of Pantheon Economics: Today\u2019s figures show that lenders are heeding the Bank of England\u2019s warnings not to be too reckless, says Capital Economics: (The FPC is the Bank\u2019s Financial Policy Committee, which told banks to set aside another \u00a310bn to cover bad loans last month) Economist Rupert Seggins tweets: This chart confirms that UK lenders are putting a squeeze on consumer credit: The Bank of England has also found that banks are being more rigorous about approving applications for credit cards and other unsecured loans. It says: Lenders reported that the availability of unsecured credit to households decreased in Q3 and expected a significant decrease in Q4. Credit scoring criteria for granting both credit card and other unsecured loans were reported to have tightened again in Q3, while the proportion of unsecured credit applications being approved fell significantly. Newsflash: British banks are planning to rein in consumer lending by the most since the financial crisis nearly a decade ago. Lenders surveyed by the Bank of England say they expect to tighten loan availability over the next three months. That follows warnings that Britain\u2019s debt mountain has risen to dangerous levels. The BoE asked lenders if they expect to make more or less unsecured credit available in the next quarter. The question returned a net balance of -28.6, the lowest figure since the collapse of Lehman Brothers in autumn 2008. That means that many more lenders expect to tighten lending rather than expand it. Lenders also reported that they tightened credit over the summer, as this chart shows (see the second line). Back in July, the BoE warned that some lenders have been too reckless with their loans, particularly for credit cards and new car loans. And last month, the Guardian ran an investigation into how the UK\u2019s debts have risen sharply, and how it could create a new crisis. Guardian Business has launched a daily email. Besides the key news headlines that you\u2019d expect, there\u2019s an at-a-glance agenda of the day\u2019s main events, insightful opinion pieces and a quality feature to sink your teeth into each day. For your morning shot of financial news, sign up here: Newsflash: Bitcoin has buffeted its way though the $5,000 mark for the first time ever. It\u2019s surged by 7% this morning, hitting $5,180 as traders send the cryptocurrency skyward. Bitcoin has now shaken off its wobble last month; it briefly slumped below $3,000 in September after China announced a clampdown on digital currency exchanges. Bitcoin\u2019s meteoric rise (and occasional stumbles) have divided financial experts. Some traders believe it could be a new safe-haven in times of political and economic strife. Others, such as JP Morgan\u2019s Jamie Dimon, claim that it\u2019s a fraud, and a bubble that will blow up eventually. Several London-based surveyors have warned that the capital\u2019s housing market is weakening. Allan Fuller, a Putney-based estate agent, says Britain\u2019s exit from the EU is one factor. Buyers are cautious, Brexit and a government with little apparent direction are major factors that especially affect London sales, media predictions of values dropping erodes confidence in buyers. Pimlico-based James Gubbins of Dauntons says talk of a house price correction is hitting confidence: The market remained soft throughout the summer period and buyers are concerned that prices are now in decline. Simon Aldous of Savills says prime London property is suffering the most. Prices across prime London continue to soften, perhaps down 1 to 2 % over the last 3 months. Price falls have been greatest in central London at the top end of the market, probably back close to 2012 levels. RICS also predicts that UK rents will rise by around 2% over the next year, but they\u2019ll probably fall in London: Simon Rubinsohn, RICS Chief Economist, says there are two reasons why the UK housing market is cooling. 1) Affordability constraints are hitting the higher priced segments of the market. That is why prices dropped in London (where the average house costs around \u00a3470,000, more than double the national average), and in the South East. 2) The increased possibility that the Bank of England will raise interest rates in the next few months. That is making borrowers more nervous, with some staying on the sidelines until the situation is clearer. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Britain\u2019s housing market is stalling as worries that interest rates could rise soon spook buyers. Sales and inquiries from potential purchasers both fell \u201cnoticeably\u201d in September, and see little evidence that the market will pick up soon. That\u2019s according to Britain\u2019s chartered surveyors, who have given a rather downbeat assessment of the sector. They report that price gauge for London remains \u201cfirmly negative\u201d, and there are also signs that prices are cooling in the South East too, with talk that houses are simply over-priced. In a new report, the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors say: The UK housing market continues to lack momentum in September, as demand from new buyers and sales fall again and the shift in interest rate expectations contributes to buyer caution in a slowing market, However, Wales, the North West of England, Scotland and Northern Ireland all saw prices rise in September - reflecting regional disparities in the housing market. Prices are expected to fall over next three months, and growth over the coming year is predicted to be the weakest since June 2016. As RICS puts it: The headline indicators on demand and sales both slipped deeper into negative territory, with this subdued picture anticipated to persist over the coming months. Feedback from contributors suggests the recent shift in interest rate expectations may be contributing to the more cautious tone in market sentiment. Estate agents are particularly downbeat about London\u2019s prospects over the next year. RICS says: At the twelve month horizon, respondents do expect prices to increase in all areas, with London the sole exception. In the capital, twelve month expectations are now more downbeat than at any other point since this series was introduced in 2010. This chart shows how prices in London are now lagging behind the rest of the country, having boomed earlier this decade: It looks like another sign that the UK economy is cooling. Also coming up today The UK government is outlining plans for a \u2018temporary\u2019 energy price cap, as it tries to deliver on Theresa May\u2019s pledge to end \u201crip-off\u201d bills. The Business department says the cap would run until 2020 (but might not get up and running until next year). A new draft bill will require regulator Ofgem to \u201cconsult and impose the cap as soon as practicable after the legislation is passed\u201d. More on that shortly. Broadcaster Sky, recruitment firm Hays and food wholesale group Booker are all reporting results this morning. Citigroup and JP Morgan kick off the bank reporting season this afternoon. European markets are expected to open little-changed on last night\u2019s close, after the US markets hit another record high. We\u2019ll also keep an eye on Washington, where the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank are holding their Annual Meeting. Here\u2019s the agenda: 9.30am: Bank of England publishes its latest credit conditions survey. That will show whether UK households and businesses are finding it harder to borrow money, and if lenders see any problems on the horizon . 2.30pm: IMF managing director Christine Lagarde gives a press conference in Washington. Expect questions about the global economic outlook and inequality, after the Fund raised its growth forecasts earlier this week. 3.30pm: European Central Bank president Mario Draghi is on an IMF/World Bank panel. He\u2019ll be discussing \u201cRethinking Macro Policy\u201d; timely, with central bankers facing pressure to unwind their stimulus programmes.",

In its fiscal monitor report Wednesday, the Washington-based body predicted that the primary surplus will come in around 2.2% of GDP next year - well short of the 3.5% forecast by the Greek government in the draft budget it has already tabled before parliament and by the EU.</p> <p>There are mounting concerns in Athens - and other EU capitals - that Greece could be force to endure yet more budget cuts and tax increases to raise the extra \u20ac2.3bn or 1.3% of GDP. </p> <p>The figures were released as feverish preparations get underway for the official White House visit which prime minister Alexis Tsipras will make next week. Much hangs on Tsipras\u2019 talks with president Donald Trump, Greek officials say. </p> <p>The October 17 talks, which took many by surprise, could play a decisive role in completing the country\u2019s third and last bailout review. With the leftist-led government\u2019s setting a \u2018clean exit\u2019 from the programme \u2013 and international supervision \u2013 by the summer of 2018, a great deal depends on the stance of the IMF.</p> <p>Tsipras is expected to appeal to Trump to urge the organisation to show more flexibility on Greece so Athens can conclude the compliance review and ultimately fend for itself by returning to international capital markets. In return he will play up Greece\u2019s crucial geopolitical role- at a time of ever worsening relations between the West and Turkey \u2013 by signing an array of bilateral defence agreements.</p> <p>Before his election Trump had tweeted that he thought the Greeks \u201care wasting their time\u201d staying in the euro zone. As the largest shareholder in the IMF, with a 17% share of the body\u2019s voting power, the US has effective veto power over many of the IMF\u2019s decision.</p> <p>The Greek deputy defence minister Dimitris Vitsas flew to Washington at the weekend to prepare for the visit amid talk of Athens purchasing more F16 fighter jets from the US. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59df5613e4b014d93a1be57e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-10-12T12:38:35.887Z\">1.38pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The news that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2017/oct/12/uk-housing-market-stalls-credit-imf-christine-lagarde-business-live?page=with:block-59df4afae4b034d41ce390b1#block-59df4afae4b034d41ce390b1\">Brexit talks have hit a \u2018very disturbing\u2019 deadlock</a> over Britain\u2019s exit bill will not pleased the City, or the country\u2019s bosses.</strong></p> <p>The lack of progress is not a great surprise, though, which explains why the pound didn\u2019t fall more sharply (a one-month low against the euro is bad enough, though). </p> <p><strong>Shilen Shah</strong>, bond strategist at <strong>Investec Wealth &amp; Investment</strong>, says investors will hope for a breakthough, fast.<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cAs expected, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator has confirmed that the EU and UK have not progressed far enough to move on to the next stage of discussions.

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s biggest companies have been given four years to appoint one board director from an ethnic minority background as part of a package of measures outlined in a government-backed review into the lack of diversity at the top of corporate Britain. Sir John Parker, the chairman of the mining company Anglo American, who conducted the review, said it should be a wake-up call for major companies that only 85 of the 1,050 director positions in the FTSE 100 companies were held by people from ethnic minorities. The companies in the FTSE 100 have been told to end their all-white boardrooms by 2021 while those in the FTSE 250, the next tier of companies on the stock market, have until 2024. The target is voluntary, but companies that fail to comply will have to explain why. Parker was first linked to the diversity campaign in 2014 when Sir Vince Cable was business secretary and set a goal to end all all-white boards by 2020. He began a formal review last year and said the four-year target was the same as that adopted by the former Standard Chartered chief executive Mervyn Davies after his review into the number of women on boards which was launched 2011. Lord Davies set goal for 25% of FTSE 100 boardroom seats to be held by women by 2015. The business minister, Margot James, said there was more to work to be done and urged companies to adopt the voluntary guidelines. An annual review will be conducted to try to measure the diversity of boardrooms. UK citizens from ethnic minorities make up 14% of the population but only account for 2% of director positions. Fifty-one of the FTSE 100 companies have no people from ethnic minorities on their boards.

      "bodyText": "Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund , has said it is unimaginable that Britain would leave the EU without a deal in March 2019, as she called for faster progress in the slow-moving Brexit talks. Speaking in Washington on Thursday to mark the start of the IMF\u2019s annual meeting, Lagarde said negotiators had to put the interests of people before those of business, and that there was a need to end uncertainty. Her words came as there were fresh signs that talks between the Brexit secretary, David Davis, and the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, are deadlocked over the size of the UK\u2019s divorce bill, which is delaying the start of negotiations on a future trade agreement. Asked what she thought the impact on Europe would be of Britain falling back on World Trade Organisation rules, Lagarde said: \u201cI just cannot imagine that that will happen, because for the people themselves, what does it mean? \u201cThe Europeans who are based in the UK and the British who are residing in the EU, WTO does not provide for such eventualities. \u201cWhen I think of the airline industries, the landing rights in various European countries \u2026 There is so much that has been brought together between the continent and the UK that it requires a very specific approach which will reduce the uncertainty that is damaging potential.\u201d The IMF considers a cliff-edge Brexit to be one of the main risks to what Lagarde called a fragile recovery in the global economy. Although the fund\u2019s prediction of an immediate recession following the EU referendum in June 2016 proved overly pessimistic, it has revised its UK forecasts for 2017 and 2018 down since the start of the year, while becoming more upbeat about the eurozone. \u201cBrexit is an ongoing process and our hope is that it be conducted promptly to reduce the level of uncertainty and the anxiety of people about the outcome and the situation of people first, of business second. Because this is affecting the people and the businesses,\u201d she said. Lagarde said she supported Theresa May\u2019s idea of an implementation period of about two years after Britain\u2019s formal exit from the EU, but that there also needed to be progress on the EU\u2019s three key issues: money, citizens\u2019 rights and the Irish border. \u201cI don\u2019t know if the two-year transition is going to be agreed upon as was proposed by prime minister May in her Florence speech, but certainly clarity on the timetable and better certainty on the three pillars which are the beginning of the negotiations would help reduce this uncertainty,\u201d she said. Lagarde said the recovery in the global economy was more broadly based than it had been at any time since the start of the financial crisis a decade ago, but was still not complete. It was \u201ctime to mend the roof while the sun was shining\u201d, she said, pointing to the need for higher spending on research and development, reduced barriers to growth, and labour market reforms to tackle weak productivity and stagnant wages. Lagarde said raising taxes on high earners, as suggested by the IMF\u2019s fiscal affairs department, would help address inequality without prejudicing growth, but that the most effective way of reducing the gap between rich and poor would be to tackle gender inequality. \u201cThat\u2019s a no-brainer\u201d, she said. Jim Kim, the World Bank president, backed Lagarde\u2019s call for action to make economies better placed to withstand future problems. \u201cTrade is picking up, but investment remains weak. We\u2019re concerned that such risks as a rise in uncertainty, policy uncertainty or possible financial market turbulence could derail this fragile recovery,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the time to implement the reforms that are going to insulate against potential downturns in the future.\u201d Kim is trying to persuade a sceptical Donald Trump of the need to increase funding for the World Bank. He said the money was needed to meet growing demand for its services.",

      "bodyText": "Royal Mail has halted Britain\u2019s first planned national walkout by postal workers since it was privatised, after successfully applying for a high court injunction. Lawyers for the Communication Workers Union failed to rebuff an attempt at the Royal Courts of Justice to stop a 48-hour walkout from 19 October. Members of the CWU voted overwhelmingly last week in favour of strikes. Staff were also considering taking industrial action during the Black Friday retail sales event next month or during the festive season. Royal Mail, which was privatised four years ago, argued the CWU had missed a Monday deadline to remove the threat and agree to negotiations. The company claimed that under an agreement between the two parties the CWU must enter mediation with Royal Mail before embarking on industrial action. The CWU in turn claimed it had been trying to find a solution to the dispute for 18 months. The company has written to the CWU invoking a \u201clegally binding external mediation process\u201d, and reiterating that any industrial action would be unlawful. Last week, 74% of the CWU\u2019s 111,000 postal workers voted in a ballot over the dispute about pensions, pay and jobs, with 89% of them backing a walkout. The vote was a test for the union after the introduction of the Trade Union Act, which requires strike ballots to have a 50% turnout. The ballot is part of a flurry of union activity this autumn as public sector and health workers discuss the possibility of industrial action. Mr Justice Supperstone, who granted the injunction, said: \u201cI consider the strike call to be unlawful and the defendant is obliged to withdraw its strike call until the external mediation process has been exhausted.\u201d More than 100 postal workers, including Dave Ward, the CWU\u2019s general secretary, gathered outside the high court for the verdict. Afterwards the union said it was \u201cextremely disappointed\u201d at the ruling and claimed that strike action was inevitable without a major change in position by the company. Ward said: \u201cThe company are deluded if they believe their courtroom politics will resolve this dispute. Instead the company\u2019s actions will have the complete opposite effect. \u201cPostal workers\u2019 attitude towards the company will harden and it makes us more determined than ever to defend our members\u2019 pensions, jobs, service and achieve our objectives. \u201cUnless the company significantly shifts its position on a range of issues and we can quickly conclude a good agreement for our members then strike action is inevitable.\u201d The Labour MP Gill Furniss pledged her support for the union, telling the protest: \u201cDespite the draconian laws imposed on workers, the CWU well surpassed the thresholds and sent a clear message to the company.\u201d A spokesman for Royal Mail said the court injunction meant any strike action before the dispute resolution procedures had been followed would be unlawful. \u201cWe will now make contact with the CWU as a matter of urgency to begin the process of external mediation. The mediation process will take close to Christmas to be completed, and may be longer. The first step is selecting a mediator acceptable to Royal Mail and the CWU from a panel that was agreed by both parties,\u201d he said.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "British banks are planning the biggest squeeze on consumer credit since late 2008, when the economy was in the depths of recession, according to a Bank of England survey. The clampdown follows warnings that Britain\u2019s debt mountain has risen to dangerous levels as households struggle with rising shop prices and low wage growth. The survey showed the net balance of lenders\u2019 expectations for the availability of unsecured lending to households over the next three months fell from -16.2 to -28.6, indicating the sharpest drop since the fourth quarter of 2008, when the UK economy contracted by 2.2%. Samuel Tombs, the chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: \u201cIt does look like banks are starting to clamp down on the supply of unsecured credit.\u201d He said a number of factors were making lenders more cautious, including a warning from the Bank last month that lenders could incur \u00a330bn of losses on credit cards, personal loans and car finance if interest rates and unemployment rose sharply. Demand for secured lending for house purchases fell slightly in the third quarter and was expected to be unchanged in the final three months of the year. Lenders made it more difficult for consumers to take out new credit cards and unsecured loans such as overdrafts in the third quarter, tightening lending criteria and approving fewer applications. \u201cSome lenders reported that they had slightly tightened their credit criteria for some products,\u201d the Bank reported. \u201cMotivations for this included concerns about customer indebtedness and the squeeze in real incomes.\u201d Last month, the chief financial regulator urged the government to step in to help tackle the mountain of debt being racked up by the most vulnerable consumers in Britain. Andrew Bailey, the chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority, told the Guardian he was concerned about the number of people who needed loans to make ends meet. Lenders taking part in the Bank\u2019s latest credit conditions survey reported a slight increase in credit card defaults in the third quarter and a \u201csignificant\u201d rise in the number of defaults on other unsecured lending, which includes overdrafts and personal loans. A growing reluctance among banks to extend consumer credit comes as markets and economists bring forward their expectations for the timing of the first rise in interest rates in more than a decade. Policymakers at Threadneeedle Street are widely expected to increase rates from their all-time low of 0.25% to 0.5% when they announce their decision on 2 November. The last time the Bank raised rates was July 2007, before the financial crisis took hold. Tombs said higher borrowing costs were likely to dampen demand for credit among consumers. \u201cFaced with the prospect of higher interest rates, households are likely to be more cautious about their borrowing,\u201d he said. Banks said they expected the availability of loans to businesses to remain roughly unchanged over the next three months. However, lenders expect demand for loans for capital investment in businesses to fall at the fastest rate since the third quarter of 2011.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The chief executive of Kobe Steel has said a deepening scandal over false inspections data may have spread beyond Japan, and conceded that his company now had \u201czero credibility\u201d. US carmaker General Motors is the latest manufacturer to check whether its cars contain falsely certified parts or components sourced from the the firm, Japan\u2019s third-biggest steelmaker. \u201cGeneral Motors is aware of the reports of material deviation in Kobe Steel copper and aluminium products,\u201d the company\u2019s spokesman Nick Richards said. \u201cWe are investigating any potential impact and do not have any additional comments at this time.\u201d The scandal has forced some of Japan\u2019s best-known manufacturers to confirm the safety of products sourced from Kobe Steel. Toyota and Nissan are among about 200 affected companies, and Hitachi said it had used Kobe Steel parts in trains built for the UK market. \u201cProducts used met safety standards, but they did not meet the specifications that were agreed between us and Kobe Steel,\u201d a Hitachi spokesman said. Pressure is mounting on Kobe after it admitted last weekend that it had falsified figures about the strength and durability of its aluminium and copper products, which are used in cars, aircraft, space rockets and defence equipment. Its chief executive, Hiroya Kawasaki, apologised on Thursday and promised that the firm would report to the trade ministry on the results of urgent safety inspections within a fortnight. He also said the cause of the falsified data would be explained within a month. \u201cThe credibility of Kobe Steel has plunged to zero. We will make efforts to regain trust as soon as possible,\u201d Kawasaki told reporters after meeting government officials. The scandal is one of several to have embroiled Japanese manufacturers in recent years, and has called the country\u2019s reputation for quality control into question. The car parts maker Takata has paid $1bn (\u00a3756m) in penalties in connection with defective airbags that have been blamed for at least 16 deaths worldwide. Earlier this month, Nissan recalled all 1.2m new cars it sold in Japan over the past three years after discovering that final vehicle inspections had not been performed by authorised technicians. Nissan used Kobe Steel aluminium in the hoods and doors of some of its vehicles. \u201cAs hoods are related to pedestrian safety, we are working to quickly assess any potential impact on vehicle functionality,\u201d it said. Toyota also confirmed that the material has been used in hoods and rear doors of some of its vehicles. The aircraft maker Boeing said it was inspecting Kobe Steel products, but that it had no reason to believe safety had been put at risk. Kobe Steel also supplies materials to the carmakers Ford, Honda, Mazda and Subaru as well as Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. Yoshihiko Katsukawa, a managing executive officer at Kobe Steel, said the scandal could widen depending on the results of an investigation by an outside law firm into cases of data falsification stretching back a decade. \u201cWe can\u2019t rule out the possibility that the external investigation will find other cases,\u201d Katsukawa said. No Kobe Steel customers had raised safety concerns or cancelled contracts with the firm, he added. Shares in the company stabilised on Thursday after about $1.6bn was wiped off its market value in two days. Wire agencies contributed to this report.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Scotch Whisky Association has called for a cut in duty on the strong stuff after warning that sales fell by 1m bottles over the first six months of the year.. The association said the slump could be attributed to a near 4% increase in duty on spirits, one of several tax-raising measures imposed by the chancellor, Philip Hammond, in his March budget. Industry figures show that an average bottle sold at \u00a312.77 will generate more than \u00a310 for the Treasury, meaning that tax makes up around 80% of the retail price of a bottle of whisky. Official HMRC figures show 36.7m bottles were released for sale in the first six months of 2017 \u2013 down from 37.7m in the same period last year. However, the industry trade body said the tax hike didn\u2019t appear to be working, as it cited a decline in tax revenues from spirits of more than 7% to \u00a3697m from \u00a3751m in the first three months of the financial year. Karen Betts, chief executive of the association, said the quarterly HMRC figures showed that the Treasury had made an error. \u201cPhilip Hammond\u2019s damaging 3.9% spirits duty hike has hit UK demand for Scotch and seen less money going to the Treasury,\u201d she said. \u201cThe chancellor should use his November budget to drop the dram duty and boost a great British success story.\u201d She said the whisky industry supported 40,000 jobs and played a key role in Scotland\u2019s economy, accounting for more than \u00a34bn in exports. Scotch is Britain\u2019s biggest food-and-drink export by far, with chocolate sales of \u00a3660m a distant second. However, the damage caused to domestic sales by the increase in spirit tax is a double whammy for an industry that has suffered several years of falling export sales. Intense competition from distillers in east Asia and the US has eaten into export markets and reduced sales abroad. The industry is also battling proposals in Holyrood to implement a 50p minimum price for alcohol in Scotland. Betts said the Treasury should look at the example set by a cut in duty two years ago. She said a 2% reduction in duty in 2015 saw spirits revenue rise by 4%, giving a \u00a3124m boost to the Treasury. And a freeze in 2016 led to a revenue increase of more than 7%, pouring an additional \u00a3229m into the chancellor\u2019s coffers.",

      "body": "<p>The Scotch Whisky Association has called for a cut in duty on the strong stuff after warning that sales fell by 1m bottles over the first six months of the year..</p> <p>The association said the slump could be attributed to a near 4% increase in duty on spirits, one of several tax-raising measures imposed by the chancellor, Philip Hammond, in his March budget.</p> <p>Industry figures show that an average bottle sold at \u00a312.77 will generate more than \u00a310 for the Treasury, meaning that tax makes up around 80% of the retail price of a bottle of whisky. Official HMRC figures show 36.7m bottles were released for sale in the first six months of 2017 \u2013 down from 37.7m in the same period last year.</p> <p>However, the industry trade body said the tax hike didn\u2019t appear to be working, as it cited a decline in tax revenues from spirits of more than 7% to \u00a3697m from \u00a3751m in the first three months of the financial year. </p> <p>Karen Betts, chief executive of the association, said the quarterly HMRC figures showed that the Treasury had made an error. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/06/hard-brexit-could-see-scotland-lose-80000-jobs-and-cost-2000-a-head\">Hard Brexit could cost Scotland \u00a32,000 a head and 80,000 jobs</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cPhilip Hammond\u2019s damaging 3.9% spirits duty hike has hit UK demand for Scotch and seen less money going to the Treasury,\u201d she said. \u201cThe chancellor should use his November budget to drop the dram duty and boost a great British success story.\u201d</p> <p>She said the whisky industry supported 40,000 jobs and played a key role in Scotland\u2019s economy, accounting for more than \u00a34bn in exports. Scotch is Britain\u2019s biggest food-and-drink export by far, with chocolate sales of \u00a3660m a distant second. </p> <p>However, the damage caused to domestic sales by the increase in spirit tax is a double whammy for an industry that has suffered several years of falling export sales. Intense competition from distillers in east Asia and the US has eaten into export markets and reduced sales abroad. The industry is also battling proposals in Holyrood to implement a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/jul/24/scotch-whisky-industry-attacks-minimum-price-plans-as-blunt-instrument\">50p minimum price for alcohol</a> in <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/scotland\">Scotland</a>. </p> <p>Betts said the Treasury should look at the example set by a cut in duty two years ago. She said a 2% reduction in duty in 2015 saw spirits revenue rise by 4%, giving a \u00a3124m boost to the Treasury. And a freeze in 2016 led to a revenue increase of more than 7%, pouring an additional \u00a3229m into the chancellor\u2019s coffers. <br></p>",

The passion for millennial pink \u2013 described by the fashion glossies as blush with a hint of beige \u2013 has driven sales of everything from shoes to sofas. Sales of men\u2019s pink T-shirts, says the department store, have soared 74% this year. Its a similar story with yellow: specifically, the bright hue of actor Emma Stone\u2019s dress in the Oscar-winning musical La La Land. Sales of sunshine-yellow fashions have climbed 44% this year. And khaki was the must-have colour for any fashion-conscious shopper, male or female. The summer months, said the department store, were peak-khaki season.

The spiraliser fad fizzled out, with sales collapsing by 40%. Colour-coordinated power suits have been given the thumbs down by female shoppers, along with push-up bras.

For many customers, their phones are the remote control for their lives, with their shopping, banking, social networks and to-do list in one place.\u201d In the home, shoppers took inspiration from Californian-style home styling to snap up cactus prints, although the retailer predicts that next year will be the year when snakes, monkeys and toucans feature heavily on jungle-style furnishings. Velvet sofas have been the look of the year for the living room, while the kitchen products that have shown the fastest sales included fat-free Eaziglide frying pans, egg gadgets and avocado tools, which saw sales rise 40%.

    "webTitle": "IMF says Australia has one of the fastest rising income inequality rates", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Australia is among countries with the highest growth in income inequality in the world over the past 30 years, according to the International Monetary Fund. Vitor Gaspar, the IMF\u2019s director of fiscal affairs, has told an audience at the launch of the IMF\u2019s latest Fiscal Monitor that Australia\u2019s income inequality growth has been similar to the US, South Africa, India, China, Spain and the UK since the 1980s. Last month the treasurer, Scott Morrison, said that income inequality was not getting worse in Australia. Morrison told the Business Council of Australia in late September that Treasury and the Reserve Bank had found, in specific analysis of current wage fundamentals, that Australian wages were growing slowly across most industries in the economy, and most regions of the country, so the slow growth was evenly shared. However, he would not release the Treasury analysis. Gaspar said IMF staff had used the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\u2019s income distribution database, Eurostat, and the World Bank\u2019s Povcalnet data, among other sources, to calculate that income inequality had increased in nearly half of the world\u2019s countries in the past three decades, and Australia had experienced a \u201clarge increase\u201d in that time. \u201cMost people around the world live in countries where inequality has increased,\u201d he said. The IMF\u2019s latest Fiscal Monitor, released overnight, is dedicated to the global growth in income inequality. It warns that while some inequality is inevitable in a market-based economic system as a result of \u201cdifferences in talent, effort, and luck\u201d, excessive inequality could \u201cerode social cohesion, lead to political polarisation, and ultimately lower economic growth\u201d. It also warns that income inequality tends to be \u201chighly correlated\u201d with wealth inequality, inequality of opportunity, and gender inequality. In July this year, when dismissing the Labor party\u2019s plan to crackdown on trusts and other forms of tax minimisation, Morrison claimed that income inequality was actually getting better in Australia. \u201cThe latest census showed on the global measure of inequality, which is the Gini coefficient, that is the accepted global measure of income inequality around the world and that figure shows it hasn\u2019t got worse, it has actually got better,\u201d he said. He was technically right \u2013 if you only consider the last few years. The Gini index is the most widely used measure of inequality. It looks at the distribution of a nation\u2019s income or wealth, where 0 represents complete equality and 100 total inequality. The 2016 census showed the Gini coefficient for equivalised disposable household income in Australia fell from 0.333 in 2013-14, to 0.323 in 2015-16. Morrison did not mention that the Gini coefficient had been even lower in 2005-06, at 0.314. Earlier this year, the OECD economic survey of Australia in April found \u201cinclusiveness has been eroded\u201d in the past two decades. \u201cThe Gini coefficient has been drifting up and households in upper-income brackets have benefited disproportionally from Australia\u2019s long period of economic growth,\u201d the report said. \u201cReal incomes for the top quintile of households grew by more than 40% between 2004 and 2014, while those for the lowest quintile only grew by about 25%.\u201d In July the Reserve Bank governor, Philip Lowe, when asked about his views on inequality at a charity lunch in Sydney, said it had grown \u201cquite a lot\u201d in the 1980s and 1990s and had risen \u201ca little bit\u201d recently, but it was important to make a distinction between income and wealth inequality. \u201cWealth inequality has become more pronounced particularly in the last five or six years because there\u2019s been big gains in asset prices,\u201d Lowe said. \u201cSo the people who own assets, which are usually wealthy people, have seen their wealth go up.\u201d He said income inequality had increased slightly in recent years, but wealth inequality was more pronounced because of rising asset prices.",

It warns that while some inequality is inevitable in a market-based economic system as a result of \u201cdifferences in talent, effort, and luck\u201d, excessive inequality could \u201cerode social cohesion, lead to political polarisation, and ultimately lower economic growth\u201d.&#xa0;</p> <p>It also warns that income inequality tends to be \u201chighly correlated\u201d with wealth inequality, inequality of opportunity, and gender inequality.</p> <p>In July this year, when dismissing the Labor party\u2019s plan to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jul/24/scott-morrison-claims-inequality-in-australia-is-not-getting-worse-but-better\">crackdown on trusts and other forms of tax minimisation</a>, Morrison claimed that income inequality was actually getting better in Australia.</p> <p>\u201cThe latest census showed on the global measure of inequality, which is the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/datablog/2017/apr/26/inequality-index-where-are-the-worlds-most-unequal-countries\">Gini coefficient</a>, that is the accepted global measure of income inequality around the world and that figure shows it hasn\u2019t got worse, it has actually got better,\u201d he said.</p> <p>He was technically right \u2013 if you only consider the last few years.</p> <p>The Gini index is the most widely used measure of inequality. It looks at the distribution of a nation\u2019s income or wealth, where 0 represents complete equality and 100 total inequality. </p> <p>The 2016 census showed the Gini coefficient for equivalised disposable household income in Australia fell from 0.333 in 2013-14, <a href=\"http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/mf/6523.0\">to 0.323 in 2015-16</a>.</p> <p>Morrison did not mention that the Gini coefficient had been even lower in 2005-06, at 0.314.</p> <p>Earlier this year, the <a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/Australia-2017-OECD-economic-survey-overview.pdf\">OECD economic survey of Australia</a> in April found \u201cinclusiveness has been eroded\u201d in the past two decades.</p> <p>\u201cThe Gini coefficient has been drifting up and households in upper-income brackets have benefited disproportionally from Australia\u2019s long period of economic growth,\u201d the report said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/datablog/ng-interactive/2016/feb/04/income-inequality-in-australia-see-how-much-the-1-earn-in-your-area\">Income inequality in Australia: see how much the 1% earn in your area</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cReal incomes for the top quintile of households grew by more than 40% between 2004 and 2014, while those for the lowest quintile only grew by about 25%.\u201d</p> <p>In July the Reserve Bank governor, Philip Lowe, when asked about his views on inequality at a charity lunch in Sydney, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/jul/26/reserve-bank-chief-warns-rising-inequality-could-erode-political-centre\">said it had grown \u201cquite a lot\u201d in the 1980s and 1990s and had risen \u201ca little bit\u201d recently</a>, but it was important to make a distinction between income and wealth inequality.</p> <p>\u201cWealth inequality has become more pronounced particularly in the last five or six years because there\u2019s been big gains in asset prices,\u201d Lowe said. \u201cSo the people who own assets, which are usually wealthy people, have seen their wealth go up.\u201d</p> <p>He said income inequality had increased slightly in recent years, but wealth inequality was more pronounced because of rising asset prices.</p>",
