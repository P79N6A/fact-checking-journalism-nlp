      "bodyText": "Watching two of the better-known rightwing thinktanks prime their intellectual cannons and bombard the same target is an impressive, if stomach-churning, sight. In the past week the Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA) and Policy Exchange, both of which have the ear of No 10 and No 11 Downing Street, have taken aim at the UK's planning laws. The IEA opted for a straightforward bombardment of the green belt. It argued that property developers should be allowed to give incentives to local communities to free up otherwise sacred ground. In other words, if developers see a profit in building on certain land, most likely in the London commuter belt, and the local parishioners can be successfully bought off, then what right does anyone have to intervene? It is the latest salvo in a sustained campaign that has won over the housing minister, Nick Boles, though not yet MPs representing home counties constituencies and electorates, who appreciate the status quo. Policy Exchange adopted a more politically sophisticated approach in its policy paper Planning for Less, the Impact of Abolishing Regional Planning. It did the job of demolishing the government's attempt at laissez faire, which was to strip local authorities of meeting targets for building homes. The targets were established by the previous government. The communities minister, Eric Pickles, said in opposition the targets were routinely missed, so what better than to get rid of them and let free-market forces take over? The thinktank, which has just seen its director, Neil O'Brien join George Osborne's team as a special adviser, commissioned a report that found abolishing targets, rather than unleashing a previously shackled industry, meant local authorities in England simply cut by 270,000 the number of new homes planned. When Britain is supposed to be enjoying a house-building renaissance akin to the 1930s, when much of today's suburbia was constructed, research that finds planners taking the opposite path should be deeply wounding. Like the IEA, Policy Exchange rejects re-establishing targets in favour of incentives for home building. However, it says the incentives should be focused on bringing back brownfield land which has already been used, often for industrial or commercial purposes. It is easy to see a political conspiracy in all this. The Tory party remains deeply in hock to the industry for donations. But it does not explain why there is a growing agreement that the only way to resolve the housing crisis is to buy off neighbourhoods in the green belt or inner city. After all, Gordon Brown was the first chancellor to commission a report, from the former Bank of England policymaker Kate Barker, which argued for extensive building on the green belts around major cities, especially London. Admittedly, he preferred a top-down approach, one that gave birth to the original targets, but there were plenty of incentives in the policy too. So a political deal is only part of the picture. A much more fundamental issue is the increasing reliance on property wealth for the UK's short-term sense of financial wellbeing, and the major part it plays in its medium-term financial destruction. When work does not pay, except for the lucky few, and savings are constantly in danger of being undermined by low interest rates or, worse, destroyed by the stock market, it seems logical to focus on property as the prime asset. It is the best pension around, isn't it? The latest Halifax survey of homeowners shows they remain optimistic about the value of their assets, with a majority expecting prices to rise in 2013. Why, when the UK economy is in a dreadful state, with its core lending banks strapped for cash, would anyone in their right mind think property prices could rise? But as Fred Harrison, research director of the London-based Land Research Trust, points out in his new book, The Traumatised Society, rent-seeking by a wealthy class of people hooked on accumulating even greater wealth is the cancer that has brought down many more civilisations than the present one. Free-market thinkers understand that the accumulation of property wealth by a wealthy middle class and corporate sector and placing a sky-high charge on it \u2013 either to rent or buy \u2013 will undermine the capitalism they seek to promote. It undermines the incentive for work and, more importantly, the incentive to innovate, both for themselves and the people who must commit a large part of their meagre income to paying the rent (or mortgage). The IEA reckons prices could fall 40% if millions of homes are built on green belt land. In this way, the landlord's power is undermined, workers have bigger disposable incomes, and innovation can begin again. But the price fall only happens at the expense of the countryside. Policy Exchange confronts this issue, but refuses to take away the incentive to gamble on property, something decried by one of its heroes, Adam Smith, and many contemporary pro-capitalist bodies that have thought more broadly about the subject. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the International Monetary Fund and the Institute for Fiscal Studies have in the past couple of years concluded that only an annual tax on land can end the obsession with property. Once landowners face a tax, they will free up land they are sitting on, rather than wait for a rising market to make a killing. In London, that is what we are seeing now. It is the crazy, financially engineered boom of 2007 beginning all over again.",

So the <em>Observer</em>'s business awards committee was deluged with entries as it met to dole out this year's gongs. After deliberating, cogitating and digesting all the worthy efforts, the following (far from exhaustive) list emerged.</p> <h2><strong>The Noel Edmonds mock crystal sherry decanter for deals (or no deals)</strong><br></h2> <p>In a year when corporate financiers were shy of even publicly suggesting <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/mergers-and-acquisitions\" title=\"\">deals</a> \u2013 never mind attempting to complete them \u2013 this was hardly a hotly contested field. However, the judges were impressed with the standard of farcical entries the City managed to conjure up, including defence group <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/baesystems\" title=\"\">BAE Systems</a>' failed attempts to merge with European counterpart EADS, plus the equally comical (but ultimately successful) efforts to combine commodity trading firm <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/glencore\" title=\"\">Glencore</a> and miner <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/xstrata\" title=\"\">Xstrata</a>.</p> <p>In the end, despite the roll-call of highly paid advisers \u2013 the outcomes were actually decided by the interventions of two heavyweight politicians. The creation of a European defence giant was scuppered after Germany's chancellor, Angela Merkel, registered her disapproval.</p> <p>In the UK, however, we possess a former top-ranking politician who takes a slightly different view to lubricating the wheels of commerce, and so the late intervention by Tony Blair, peace envoy extraordinaire, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/sep/07/glencore-delay-xstrata-merger-vote\" title=\"\">saving the formation of Glenstrata</a> was the judges' unanimous choice in this category. When Glencore announced in February that it was making a tilt for Xstrata, the mining firm in which it already held a 34% stake, it seemed little could go wrong.

      "bodyText": "This has been a vintage year \u2013 maybe not for business but for commercial farce and scandals. So the Observer's business awards committee was deluged with entries as it met to dole out this year's gongs. After deliberating, cogitating and digesting all the worthy efforts, the following (far from exhaustive) list emerged. The Noel Edmonds mock crystal sherry decanter for deals (or no deals) In a year when corporate financiers were shy of even publicly suggesting deals \u2013 never mind attempting to complete them \u2013 this was hardly a hotly contested field. However, the judges were impressed with the standard of farcical entries the City managed to conjure up, including defence group BAE Systems' failed attempts to merge with European counterpart EADS, plus the equally comical (but ultimately successful) efforts to combine commodity trading firm Glencore and miner Xstrata. In the end, despite the roll-call of highly paid advisers \u2013 the outcomes were actually decided by the interventions of two heavyweight politicians. The creation of a European defence giant was scuppered after Germany's chancellor, Angela Merkel, registered her disapproval. In the UK, however, we possess a former top-ranking politician who takes a slightly different view to lubricating the wheels of commerce, and so the late intervention by Tony Blair, peace envoy extraordinaire, saving the formation of Glenstrata was the judges' unanimous choice in this category. When Glencore announced in February that it was making a tilt for Xstrata, the mining firm in which it already held a 34% stake, it seemed little could go wrong. That seems fantastically complacent now. First, Xstrata shareholders didn't like the price or the amounts they were expected to pay the miner's management just to persuade them to stay. As they whinged, Qatar's sovereign wealth fund started buying up Xstrata shares, eventually soaking up a 12% stake that everyone assumed would be voted in favour of the deal. D'oh! The Qataris then surprised almost everybody by demanding a better price, and Glencore's boss, Ivan Glasenberg, was forced to call in Blair \u2013 hereby supplying a different headline to a story that might be viewed as a surrender. The Kieron Dyer diamond earring for overpricing assets In a year with few real transactions, our judges focused their energies on examining 2012's major flotations. Here, there were early signs that a challenging field might emerge, with shares in Manchester United's long-awaited US float quickly slumping from even its discounted price, before recovering by the end of the year. But, just as there is currently a large gap at the top of the English Premier League, so one runaway leader eventually emerged in this category. Facebook's shares were offered to the market in May at $38 (\u00a324) a pop \u2013 and pop is exactly what they did: the market currently reckons that the price was 30% too high. In terms of paper losses, that looks costly. Founder Mark Zuckerberg's Facebook stake is now worth $5bn less than when the company floated. The Charles Ponzi endowment for white-collar crime This has been a stellar year for entries in this category, with a string of financial criminals eager to benefit from the endowment and enroll on various residential courses: stockbroker Nicholas Levene got a 13-year stretch for a \u00a332m Ponzi scheme; UBS \"rogue trader\" Kweku Adoboli was jailed for seven years on two counts of fraud; Rajat Gupta, the former Goldman Sachs director, was sentenced to two years in prison for leaking boardroom secrets to the former hedge fund manager Raj Rajaratnam; while Peter Madoff, the kid brother of the current king of white-collar crime Bernie, got 10 years for his role in his sibling's vast scheme. But the judges also took into account the current financial circumstances of the entries, which left them with a clear winner. Asil Nadir, the fallen business tycoon who spent 17 years as a fugitive in apparent luxury in northern Cyprus before returning to the UK in 2010, was jailed this year for stealing \u00a329m from his failed Polly Peck empire. He has told the court that he is now broke, although the court is taking a slightly different view. It said he had to pay back \u00a35m of the money he stole, or face a further six years in prison, so this award may come in handy. The Sid Waddell memorial salver for the stretched analogy The salver is obviously in its inaugural year, following the untimely death of the peerless darts commentator, but instantly there was a clear winner. Her Majesty's financial press was the unanimous choice of the judges for its work on what they called the \"shareholder spring\" \u2013 a cunning homage to 2011's Arab incarnation, only this time the soundbite encapsulated the actions of courageous investors who suddenly realised they had a vote. The spring comparison didn't quite stretch, of course, perhaps because one rebellion was notable for the overthrowing of repressive regimes; while the other featured a few men in suits popping along to some conference centre to ask another bloke in another suit to stop trousering so much pay. Still, the list of protests was long and undistinguished. In mid April Citigroup shareholders rejected the bank's plan to pay its chief executive $15m (\u00a39.4m) for a year during which its shares fell by 44% \u2013 and it seemed like such a novel ruse that others decided to join in the fun. Shareholders in Capital Shopping Centres, AstraZeneca, Barclays, Aviva, Trinity Mirror, William Hill and WPP (among others) all had a tilt at the City's latest parlour game and, on a few occasions, some were even listened to. At their respective companies next year, Andrew Moss of Aviva, David Brennan of AstraZeneca and Sly Bailey of Trinity Mirror will be spared a similar attack. They'll be spared all other duties too. The Dick Van Dyke medal for poor banking behaviour As usual, our blue riband gong was by far the most hotly contested field, with several of the biggest names in the sector submitting world-class claims. The judges highly commended the entries of Barclays and UBS (Libor-rigging), Standard Chartered (alleged sanctions-busting) and Royal Bank of Scotland (technology failures), but they still came out hailing a clear winner. Earlier this month HSBC was fined \u00a31.2bn by US authorities for having systems so lax that it let billions of pounds be laundered for drug barons in Mexico. Our judges were especially impressed with the bank giving cashiers in its Mexican branches extra-wide windows, to allow the piles of cash to be paid in. The Oliver Hardy punch bowl for operational competence This category basically became a two-horse race between the west coast mainline franchising debacle and the woeful efforts of G4S to provide enough security staff for the Olympic Games. The first saw the Department of Transport award the rail franchise between London and Glasgow to First Group \u2013 which prompted threats of a legal challenge from the incumbent Virgin and then the government's admission that it had actually cocked the whole thing up. That shambles will cost the taxpayer at least \u00a340m in compensation to the original bidders, but probably a lot more once all legal costs have been factored in. Still, the judges thought that even more impressive was how G4S didn't quite manage to anticipate the arrival of London 2012, when it admitted just weeks before the start of the Olympic Games that it would not be able to fulfil its contract to supply thousands of security staff. Rarely does the inept performance of a private company require the government to call for army reinforcements, but such was the size of this blunder the troops arrived. Wags immediately called for heads to roll. Deputy heads did. The Jimmy Carr award for tax planning Another category that taxed the judges, especially as the figure this gong is named after (following a career telling jokes about tax avoiders) put in a stellar entry of his own. Still, the committee felt that 2012 was the year in which an overseas entry should be honoured, with a string of well crafted submissions ranging from Swiss-based commodity trading firm Glencore to enterprising internet businesses such as eBay and Amazon. All were highly commended but coffee chain Starbucks stood out from this high-class field for paying virtually no UK corporation tax \u2013 and then making an absolute Horlicks of trying to defend itself. A better strategy in 2013 might be to pay more taxes, and fewer PR advisers. The Paul Volcker plate for double-dip recessions At the start of 2012, the Treasury was anticipating a return to growth. It was proved right but sadly the UK economy started improving only after it had slipped into a double-dip recession. The year as a whole is expected to be flat. So for that statistical achievement alone, the committee felt compelled to recognise the chancellor, George Osborne. He also stands on the threshold of a tantalising achievement, as he goes for the triple-dip in 2013.",

They may own properties in France, Spain or Italy; the excessive free-market policies they enthusiastically espoused under Margaret Thatcher may have contributed to a situation where about half of \"our\" exports are produced by foreign-owned companies in the UK, but my goodness, don't they just hate Europe! As if the conjuncture of a world financial crisis and a eurozone on life support is not enough, it looks as though the big issue which is going to dominate British politics in 2013 is not how Britain, drawing on a wealth of historical experience, can contribute to a co-ordinated rescue plan for so many afflicted western economies including our own; no, it is going to be whether or not we should have a referendum about our membership of the EU \u2013 not necessarily this year, but at some stage during what has already established itself as a turbulent decade. You could not make it up. It was not for nothing that Sir Edward Heath, the Conservative prime minister who thought he had finally resolved Britain's ambiguous relationship with Europe by taking us into the European Community, used to refer to his sceptical colleagues as \"septics\". The story of the long haul from President Charles de Gaulle's multiple use of the word \"non\" to UK entry and then the 1975 referendum is elegantly told in The Official History of Britain and the European Community, Volume 2, From Rejection to Referendum, 1963-75 (Routledge) by Sir Stephen Wall. Wall is in the best tradition of British diplomatists. His inside knowledge \u2013 he was private secretary to five foreign secretaries, and to PM John Major, as well as being an adviser on Europe to Tony Blair \u2013 and his access to the archives, have been put to good use in an enthralling account which I recommend to all, including the sceptics, or septics, and which may just give the latter pause for thought. The question they might ask themselves is: do we really have to go through all this again, and in the midst of a serious economic crisis? Now, I write as someone who is not such a Europhile as to have supported what I regarded as the premature and faulty construction of the eurozone. And, of course, there is continual need for reform of the abuses of the EU budget, not least the way that the common agricultural policy, while a smaller proportion of the budget than it used to be, subsidises large corporate, often Eurosceptical, farmers who are the first to complain about subsidies for the poor and the homeless. But such abuses are best attacked from within the tent, not outside it. And those fantasists who go on about a looser association with Scandinavia and Switzerland will benefit from the historical explanation of why we as a nation felt it necessary to move from EFTA (the European Free Trade Association) to our successive applications to join the real thing. It is remarkable how people still go on about the \"special relationship\" with the US as an alternative to membership of the EU. If there is one thing successive postwar US administrations have been consistent about regarding our relationship with Europe, it is that we should be within, not without. Many of us hoped that the 1975 referendum \u2013 when we voted to stay in by a two-to-one majority \u2013 would settle the issue for good. But the real position, as noted by David Watt in the Financial Times, was that the 1975 vote had made secession \"inconceivable in this generation\". As Wall points out, the day after the referendum, PM Harold Wilson told his principal private secretary, Ken Stowe, that it had taken him 10 years to achieve a yes vote. By this he meant that he had decided way back in 1965 that membership was in the country's best interests, but all the time he was fighting a very powerful group of anti-marketeers within the party. \"People say I have no strategy, cannot think strategically,\" he observed to Stowe in what must surely be one of his greatest quotes. He had decided that the only way to defeat these anti-marketeers was to go above them to the country. The saying \"a week is a long time in politics\", used by Wilson, was actually coined by President Truman. Well, a generation is a very long time in politics, and the generation that David Watt referred to is no longer in control. We have another prime minister, leader of the party that took the UK into the community, and wisely chose not to sign up for the single currency, who is now faced with the problem of keeping his party together. Keeping out of the eurozone has enabled UK policymakers to retain an independent monetary policy and flexibility in the exchange rate. Fiscal policy, both here and in the eurozone, is absurdly inappropriate for a depression associated with a banking crisis, but unemployment here is mercifully a long way below the levels in Spain, Portugal, Ireland and Greece. But what is happening in the so-called peripheral nations is deeply worrying. Anyone with a sense of history is familiar with the saying \"civilisation hangs by a thread\". The austerity policies espoused by Germany, the IMF and the European commission are gambling with social stability. It is time for European policymakers to get together and examine their consciences as well as their policies. This should be a more important objective for the British government than reconsidering its membership of the EU.",

As Wall points out, the day after the referendum, PM Harold Wilson told his principal private secretary, Ken Stowe, that it had taken him 10 years to achieve a yes vote.</p> <p>By this he meant that he had decided way back in 1965 that membership was in the country's best interests, but all the time he was fighting a very powerful group of anti-marketeers within the party. \"People say I have no strategy, cannot think strategically,\" he observed to Stowe in what must surely be one of his greatest quotes. He had decided that the only way to defeat these anti-marketeers was to go above them to the country.</p> <p>The saying \"a week is a long time in politics\", used by Wilson, was actually coined by President Truman. Well, a generation is a very long time in politics, and the generation that David Watt referred to is no longer in control. We have another prime minister, leader of the party that took the UK into the community, and wisely chose not to sign up for the single currency, who is now faced with the problem of keeping his party together.</p> <p>Keeping out of the eurozone has enabled UK policymakers to retain an independent monetary policy and flexibility in the exchange rate. Fiscal policy, both here and in the eurozone, is absurdly inappropriate for a depression associated with a banking crisis, but unemployment here is mercifully a long way below the levels in Spain, Portugal, Ireland and Greece.</p> <p>But what is happening in the so-called peripheral nations is deeply worrying. Anyone with a sense of history is familiar with the saying \"civilisation hangs by a thread\". The austerity policies espoused by Germany, the IMF and the European commission are gambling with social stability. It is time for European policymakers to get together and examine their consciences as well as their policies. This should be a more important objective for the British government than reconsidering its membership of the EU.</p>",
