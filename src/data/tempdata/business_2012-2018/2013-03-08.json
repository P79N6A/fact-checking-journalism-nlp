The insurance business behind what are arguably some of the most annoying adverts on TV for brands including Sheila's Wheels and gocompare.com made the announcement in its prospectus as it plans to go public with a value of up to \u00a31.3bn. If successful, it will make the FTSE 250 listing the biggest of the year so far and leave multimillionaire founder Peter Wood with up to \u00a3151m when he sells a quarter of his 49% stake in the firm he set up 13 years ago. He will remain the biggest shareholder, with 35% of the company, and stay on as chairman with a \u00a3730,000 annual salary, private health insurance and his own driver for business and personal use. The sale is also set to give a significant boost for the Exchequer, with up to \u00a342m due in capital gains tax on Wood's windfall, after the businessman, who is known for paying substantial tax in the UK, decided against relocating to Jersey for the flotation. Esure's chief executive Stuart Vann could earn up to \u00a31.7m for his work in the first year and chief finance officer Darren Ogden, could earn up to \u00a31m. The firm employs 1,400 staff and the prospectus reveals it will give long-service awards to any members of staff who have been there for two years or more. A source close to the business said: \"It will be very democratic, with the payouts based purely on length of service rather than on pay level, and ranging from a few hundred to several thousand pounds.\" The payouts will be in the form of shares worth \u00a33m in total, which can be sold in three years' time. The company, which insures 5% of British motorists, aims to sell around 50% of its share capital for between 240p and 310p per share as bosses start a two-week roadshow to woo potential investors.

He will also be entitled to shares worth \u00a3831,250 at flotation, but will not be able to cash them in for at least three years and then only if targets are achieved. Ogden will take home up to \u00a3514,600 in the first year and entitled to \u00a3465,000-worth of shares which he can sell in three years, pending achievements. Some bonuses will have clawback agreements attached to them. The float comes just three years after Wood led a management buyout of a 70% stake from Lloyds Banking Group, which valued the insurer at just \u00a3260m. Never employing a marketing manager, Wood has always overseen the brand image of the business, including the neon pink-clad women advertising Sheila's Wheels, using Michael Winner in Esure commercials with the catchphrase \"Calm down, dear\" and joint venture Go Compare with its opera-singing mascot. He also set up Direct Line, with its distinctive red phone on wheels and catchy jingle. Direct Line was recently floated by RBS and became particularly popular with retail investors, with shares rising 20%. Wood recently told the Guardian: \"This is my seventh insurer \u2013 and my last. I will be here for as long as I can make a contribution. Or until Stuart [Vann] taps me on the shoulder and says 'Time for a bit more golf'.\" Last year Esure revealed that annual pre-tax profits had doubled to \u00a3116m.",

      "bodyText": "A fresh row over City pay erupted on Friday when two of Britain's biggest banks, Barclays and bailed out Royal Bank of Scotland, revealed that 523 of their staff took home more than \u00a31m in 2012. RBS, which is 83% owned by the taxpayer, was accused of having the \"best paid public sector workers by a mile\" after admitting for the first time that 95 bankers were handed \u00a31m last year even though the bank was hit by a \u00a3390m fine for rigging Libor and suffered a prolonged computer breakdown. Barclays, fined \u00a3290m for manipulating the benchmark interest rate, paid 428 staff more than \u00a31m. The pay deals at Barclays eclipsed those at HSBC, Britain's biggest bank, which earlier this week said 204 of its employees received \u00a31m or more. The scale of the pay five years on from the banking crisis prompted TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said to say it justified the EU cap on bonuses. \"It is as if the financial crisis never happened,\" she said, describing the pay as \"obscene\". Barclays highlighted the discrepancies between its highest and lowest paid staff by admitting that 1,338 of its bankers received more than \u00a3500,000 while more than half its workforce \u2013 71,581 staff \u2013 took home \u00a325,000 or less, prompting Dominic Hook, national officer at the union Unite to hit out against \"the rampant inequality\" in the 140,000 strong workforce. At RBS, where chief executive Stephen Hester received \u00a32.2m \u2013 when part payment of his 2010 bonus is included but before a \u00a31.6m award of shares he could get in three years \u2013 the highest pay for one individual, \u00a35.5m, contrasted with the average pay of \u00a334,000. Some 1,950 RBS staff earn more than \u00a3250,000. Lord Oakeshott, Lib Dem peer, said of the RBS bankers: \"They're the best paid public sectors workers by a mile, in a bank that keeps failing the public by failing to lend. Let's end this nonsense and nationalise RBS now\". By publishing pay deals of those earning more than \u00a31m the banks are complying with proposals first set out by Sir David Walker \u2013 the new chairman of Barclays \u2013 when Labour was in power but rejected by George Osborne when he became Chancellor. Osborne has welcomed the disclosure as allowing \"shareholders to properly hold institutions to account for how they pay their staff.\" But it was Walker's appointment at Barclays that sparked the disclosures which showed that five individuals at the bank and one at RBS earned more than \u00a35m. David Hillman, spokesman for the Robin Hood Tax campaign, said the payouts showed \"just how out of sync with the rest of reality banks have become\". The number of millionaires at Barclays is down and while RBS did not provide comparisons it is thought to have paid more than 500 bankers over \u00a31m before the government bailout. The top eight highest paid executives at Barclays reporting to the chief executive received between \u00a33.7m and \u00a31.2m a year \u2013 a total of \u00a323m. The individuals do not need to be identified but it appeared that Rich Ricci, who runs the Barclays investment bank, slumped to the seventh highest paid with \u00a31.5m. For RBS the eight highest paid shared \u00a314m although the highest paid \u2013 thought to be Ellen Alemany, who runs the US division \u2013 received \u00a34.8m. Other top RBS earners are thought to include Nathan Bostock, head of risk, who got \u00a33.1m, head of business banking Chris Sullivan who received \u00a32m, and Ross McEwan the new head of the retail bank with \u00a31.7m. The finance director Bruce van Saun, the only other executive on the RBS board with Hester, received a \u00a3980,000 bonus to take his total to \u00a31.7m and he will get a 2% rise in his \u00a3750,000 salary this year. Barclays also complied with rules showing that it has 393 \"code staff\" \u2013 those who monitor risks or take risks \u2013 who were paid an average of \u00a31.3m. At RBS the 368 code staff had an average of \u00a3701,000. At Barclays, keen to avoid a repeat of last year's revolt over pay, former chief executive Bob Diamond received \u00a31.9m after the bank paid \u00a3602,000 towards his tax. He forfeited \u00a319m of shares when he left and will be continued to paid until July this year \u2013 when he stands to get a \u00a32m lump sum \u2013and benefits such as health insurance and a driver of \u00a3400,000. His successor Antony Jenkins, promoted from running the retail bank, was paid a salary for the full year \u2013 he became chief executive at the end of August \u2013 of \u00a3833,000, pension contributions of \u00a3215,000 and benefits of \u00a381,000, while \u00a32.1m of plans from previous years paid out. Jenkins was awarded \u00a34.4m of shares which pay out in three years time; the value of \u00a31.5m is assigned for 2012. The bank produced a figure for his pay of \u00a32.5m. Marcus Agius, the former chairman, is receiving \u00a3175,000 as an adviser to the Barclays corporate bank. The bank said: \"We have made substantial reductions in remuneration, including clawing back \u00a3300m of unvested deferred and long-term incentive awards and risk adjustments of \u00a3860m to our 2012 incentives pool to reflect the Libor investigation and other risk issues in 2012.\" Barclays said the 45% of all investment bank did not receive bonuses although the bank is still paying out \u00a31.8bn in total to its staff after profits dropped to \u00a3246m from \u00a35.9bn a year ago. Top line profits rose 25% to \u00a37bn.",

    "webTitle": "Online grocery shopping: when will Morrisons come in from the cold?", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Sir Ken Morrison, the no-nonsense Yorkshireman who built up the supermarket chain from his father's market stalls, famously dismissed home deliveries as \"something he had done on his bike as a young man\". With Sir Ken no longer in charge, Morrisons is less sniffy about home delivery \u2013 but it remains the only big UK supermarket to shun the booming business of online groceries, which analysts expect to be worth \u00a37.5bn this year. Investors are getting impatient with Morrisons' wariness. Dalton Philips, who came in as chief executive after Marc Bolland jumped to M&amp;S, has said the online grocery business \"is something that we are going to have to do in the coming months\". He is under mounting pressure to explain his plans as he prepares to announce the company's full-year results next Thursday. Morrisons' internet strategy could make or break the Irish chief executive, who marks his third anniversary in the top job this month. \"They have got to come out definitively and say what they are doing,\" said Neil Saunders, managing director of Conlumino retail analysts. \"The market is looking for a commitment or otherwise to do online, with a time frame on that, and they are looking for some detail on how the offer will be constructed.\" Morrisons, which had the worst performance of any supermarket chain over the lucrative Christmas period, risks being left behind as the online market soars, analysts warn. When it goes online, it will have to run fast to catch up with rivals who have been selling food over the internet for more than a decade. Tesco.com went live in 2000. Ocado, the upmarket online grocer that sells Waitrose goods, dispatched its first van in 2002. \"Online groceries is about 4.5% to 5% of the market. It is growing around 15% per annum and by 2020 we think it will be worth between 10-12% of the market,\" said Clive Black, head of research at Shore Capital. \"[By 2020] Morrisons would effectively be competing only with 88% of the market and that is a very difficult task.\" Morrisons blamed its miserable Christmas trading partly on the absence of an online grocery business \u2013 like for like sales were down 2.5% in the last six weeks of the year. It has been taking tentative steps in cyberspace. In 2011 it bought Kiddicare.com. Last year it launched wine website Morrisons Cellar, where a bottle starts at \u00a33.99 and customers can do a taste test devised by posh north London wine merchant Bibendum. This spring, the retailer will launch a kitchen products website with home-shopping specialist Lakeland, bringing its tally of online businesses to three. And in a move to become more internet savvy, in 2011 Morrisons acquired a 10% stake in Fresh Direct, an online grocer delivering farm-fresh produce to well-heeled New Yorkers. Morrisons snapped up 56 stores from bust retailers Blockbuster Video and HMV last month, as it seeks to increase its portfolio of convenience stores \u2013 another gap in its business that gives investors a headache. Although Philips agrees the online grocery business cannot be ignored, he strikes a wary note. The \"genius of the supermarket\", he said recently, is that customers carry the costs of picking out the goods and shuttling to and from the shop. If supermarkets take this bit over, prices could rise for those shoppers who prefer the bricks-and-mortar experience. \"You can end up therefore subsidising your online shopper by charging your core customer more and that is something that philosophically I struggle with,\" he told BBC You and Yours. Bill Grimsey, former chief executive of Wickes, Iceland and Focus DIY, says Morrisons cannot afford to stay offline as consumers abandon bricks-and-mortar shops. \"Do Morrisons have a choice to stay out of the online food shopping business? The answer is unequivocally no. If they don't, Tesco, Sainsbury's and Asda will be taking shoppers [Morrisons] could have earned.\" Stanislav Desyatnikov, 42, a software engineer, might be just the customer Morrisons is missing out on. Popping into Morrisons in north London to pick up some juice, he said he and his wife shop online for groceries once or twice a month \u2013 at Tesco. If Morrisons offered home shopping, he could be tempted. \"I work nearby, so I could have the food delivered to my office.\" When Morrisons takes the plunge, it must decide whether to ship orders out from the network of 455 supermarkets, or use \"dark stores\", drab dotcom-only warehouses that are springing up on industrial estates across the country to feed the hunger for online shopping. Analysts expect Morrisons will choose store delivery to get their fresh produce speedily to customers. \"Morrisons has a great advantage in that it really is top of the pack for fresh food,\" said Andrew Stevens, senior retail analyst at Verdict. A 'fulfilment from store' strategy would be the best way to translate these fresh-food values, he said. \"Though in London and the south-east, it will certainly resort to warehouses, because it has fewer stores.\" This combination of store delivery and warehouses in the south east is favoured by Tesco and Asda, while Sainsbury's has traditionally preferred delivery from its shops. But Morrisons will have to open its wallet if it wants to elbow its way into this crowded market. It could try to tempt customers away from rivals with free delivery, fistfuls of discount coupons, or the increasingly popular \"click and collect\" service that allows customers to pick up their online orders in-store Speculation persists that Morrisons could make a bid for Ocado. This would give them \"a leg up in the market\", said Saunders of Conlumino, \"but they would have to think seriously because Ocado is not a profit-making operation at the moment\". Not everyone is convinced internet shopping is the answer to Morrisons' recent sales slowdown. Some analysts accuse the retailer of deserting its core customers, by moving up-market with its \"Fresh Format\" revamp, stores offering treats such as artisanal bread and olive counters. \"Fresh Format is visually lovely,\" said Clive Black at Shore Capital. \"But we think they have disenfranchised some of their traditional customers and failed to attract new ones,\" he said. \"The fresh herbs and the cupcakes haven't attracted the customers Morrisons seem to have been aspiring too.\" Philips has always stoutly rejected the charge of losing touch with his customers. He also insists being last to online shopping is no bad thing \u2013 because Morrisons can learn from rivals' mistakes. But time is running out. \"There is no last-mover advantage. It is a fiction,\" said Saunders. \"The problem is that the grocery market is saturated. \"Morrisons has now got to steal the show from every other player in order to win business.\" Other online refuseniks: Aldi and Lidl: Tight times mean \"hard discounters\" Aldi and Lidl are booming \u2013 without a single sale online. With \"a lean and efficient logistical model\" that eschews \"luxuries, such as customer service and plastic bags\" it is hard to see why they would go for the \"frippery\" of a pricey online service for groceries, said Bryan Roberts at Kantar retail consultancy. But online shopping could make sense for their non-food products, he added. Poundland: Everything for a pound might not sound like a promising start for a home shopping service, but Poundland could make it work. Rival discounter Poundworld created its Discount Wholesale website, which sells everything from novelty ties to pregnancy tests. Targeted at small traders, Discount Wholesale demands a minimum spend of \u00a3500. Primark: Booming sales show being offline isn't hurting, but supply chain director Martin White has said it would be \"dumb as a business if we weren't looking online\". Clive Black, head of research at Shore Capital, thinks it unlikely Primark will go online soon, but it will \"develop its website so it is more of a showroom\".",

Morrisons' internet strategy could make or break the Irish chief executive, who marks his third anniversary in the top job this month.</p> <p>\"They have got to come out definitively and say what they are doing,\" said Neil Saunders, managing director of Conlumino retail analysts. \"The market is looking for a commitment or otherwise to do online, with a time frame on that, and they are looking for some detail on how the offer will be constructed.\"</p> <p>Morrisons, which had the worst performance of any supermarket chain over the lucrative Christmas period, risks being left behind as the online market soars, analysts warn. When it goes online, it will have to run fast to catch up with rivals who have been selling food over the internet for more than a decade. Tesco.com went live in 2000. Ocado, the upmarket online grocer that sells Waitrose goods, dispatched its first van in 2002.</p> <p>\"Online groceries is about 4.5% to 5% of the market. It is growing around 15% per annum and by 2020 we think it will be worth between 10-12% of the market,\" said Clive Black, head of research at Shore Capital. \"[By 2020] Morrisons would effectively be competing only with 88% of the market and that is a very difficult task.\"</p> <p>Morrisons blamed its miserable Christmas trading partly on the absence of an online grocery business \u2013 like for like sales were down 2.5% in the last six weeks of the year.</p> <p>It has been taking tentative steps in cyberspace. In 2011 it bought Kiddicare.com. Last year it launched wine website Morrisons Cellar, where a bottle starts at \u00a33.99 and customers can do a taste test devised by posh north London wine merchant Bibendum. This spring, the retailer will launch a kitchen products website with home-shopping specialist Lakeland, bringing its tally of online businesses to three.</p> <p>And in a move to become more internet savvy, in 2011 Morrisons acquired a 10% stake in Fresh Direct, an online grocer delivering farm-fresh produce to well-heeled New Yorkers.</p> <p>Morrisons snapped up 56 stores from bust retailers Blockbuster Video and HMV last month, as it seeks to increase its portfolio of convenience stores \u2013 another gap in its business that gives investors a headache.</p> <p>Although Philips agrees the online grocery business cannot be ignored, he strikes a wary note. The \"genius of the supermarket\", he said recently, is that customers carry the costs of picking out the goods and shuttling to and from the shop. If supermarkets take this bit over, prices could rise for those shoppers who prefer the bricks-and-mortar experience.</p> <p>\"You can end up therefore subsidising your online shopper by charging your core customer more and that is something that philosophically I struggle with,\" he told BBC You and Yours.</p> <p>Bill Grimsey, former chief executive of Wickes, Iceland and Focus DIY, says Morrisons cannot afford to stay offline as consumers abandon bricks-and-mortar shops. \"Do Morrisons have a choice to stay out of the online food shopping business? The answer is unequivocally no. If they don't, Tesco, Sainsbury's and Asda will be taking shoppers [Morrisons] could have earned.\"</p> <p>Stanislav Desyatnikov, 42, a software engineer, might be just the customer Morrisons is missing out on. Popping into Morrisons in north London to pick up some juice, he said he and his wife shop online for groceries once or twice a month \u2013 at Tesco. If Morrisons offered home shopping, he could be tempted. \"I work nearby, so I could have the food delivered to my office.\"</p> <p>When Morrisons takes the plunge, it must decide whether to ship orders out from the network of 455 supermarkets, or use \"dark stores\", drab dotcom-only warehouses that are springing up on industrial estates across the country to feed the hunger for online shopping.</p> <p>Analysts expect Morrisons will choose store delivery to get their fresh produce speedily to customers. \"Morrisons has a great advantage in that it really is top of the pack for fresh food,\" said Andrew Stevens, senior retail analyst at Verdict. A 'fulfilment from store' strategy would be the best way to translate these fresh-food values, he said.</p> <p>\"Though in London and the south-east, it will certainly resort to warehouses, because it has fewer stores.\"</p> <p>This combination of store delivery and warehouses in the south east is favoured by Tesco and Asda, while Sainsbury's has traditionally preferred delivery from its shops.</p> <p>But Morrisons will have to open its wallet if it wants to elbow its way into this crowded market. It could try to tempt customers away from rivals with free delivery, fistfuls of discount coupons, or the increasingly popular \"click and collect\" service that allows customers to pick up their online orders in-store</p> <p>Speculation persists that Morrisons could make a bid for Ocado. This would give them \"a leg up in the market\", said Saunders of Conlumino, \"but they would have to think seriously because Ocado is not a profit-making operation at the moment\".</p> <p>Not everyone is convinced internet shopping is the answer to Morrisons' recent sales slowdown. Some analysts accuse the retailer of deserting its core customers, by moving up-market with its \"Fresh Format\" revamp, stores offering treats such as artisanal bread and olive counters. \"Fresh Format is visually lovely,\" said Clive Black at Shore Capital. \"But we think they have disenfranchised some of their traditional customers and failed to attract new ones,\" he said. \"The fresh herbs and the cupcakes haven't attracted the customers Morrisons seem to have been aspiring too.\"</p> <p>Philips has always stoutly rejected the charge of losing touch with his customers. He also insists being last to online shopping is no bad thing \u2013 because Morrisons can learn from rivals' mistakes.</p> <p>But time is running out. \"There is no last-mover advantage. It is a fiction,\" said Saunders. \"The problem is that the grocery market is saturated. &#xa0;</p> <p>\"Morrisons has now got to steal the show from every other player in order to win business.\"</p> <p><strong>Other online refuseniks:</strong></p> <p><strong>Aldi and Lidl:</strong> Tight times mean \"hard discounters\" Aldi and Lidl are booming \u2013 without a single sale online. With \"a lean and efficient logistical model\" &#xa0;that eschews \"luxuries, such as customer service and plastic bags\" it is hard to see why they would go for the \"frippery\" of a pricey online service for groceries, &#xa0;said Bryan Roberts at Kantar retail consultancy. But online shopping could make sense for their non-food products, he added.</p> <p><strong>Poundland:</strong> Everything for a pound might not sound like a promising start for a home shopping service, but Poundland could make it work. &#xa0;Rival discounter Poundworld created its Discount Wholesale website, which sells everything from novelty ties to pregnancy tests. Targeted at small traders, Discount Wholesale demands a minimum spend of \u00a3500.</p> <p><strong>Primark:</strong> Booming sales show being offline isn't hurting, but supply chain director Martin White has said it would be \"dumb as a business if we weren't looking online\". Clive Black, head of research at Shore Capital, thinks it unlikely Primark will go online soon, but it will \"develop its website so it is more of a showroom\".</p>",

    "webTitle": "Barclays is still mugging its shareholders", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "It's a triumph. Pay at the top of Barclays is plunging, just as the directors always said it would. Look, only 428 staff were paid more than \u00a31m last year; that's down from 473 a year ago. And the numbers in the \u00a35m-plus bracket are collapsing. There used to be 17 in this exclusive club and now there are only five. Remarkable. The \"go to\" bank, as Barclays styles itself these days, is going to work on the pay front. Not impressed? Nor should you be. It is five years since the start of the banking crisis and four years since the survivors assured us that pay levels in the industry would fall dramatically because, in an age of higher capital thresholds and lower leverage, profits would be harder to generate and shareholders would expect reform. The prediction about profits was accurate. Barclays ranks as a relative outperformer but its return on shareholders' equity \u2013 a pure measure of profits \u2013 was only 7.8% last year. This compares with a cost of shareholders' equity that the bank puts at 11.5%. In effect, Barclays failed to earn its keep last year, which has been the case for several years now. That's the backdrop against which to measure the pace of Barclays' overhaul of pay. It is astonishingly slow. \"We must ensure we pay no more than necessary to achieve Barclays' objectives,\" declares Sir John Sunderland, chair of the pay committee, in this year's annual report, claiming the bank is taking a \"different approach\". In fact, his words are an echo of those of former chairman Sir Marcus Agius, who used to claim that \"we pay as little as we can get away with\". To be fair to Barclays' new-broom board, under chief executive Antony Jenkins, a few points should be acknowledged. First, Barclays is by no means the worst bank in dragging its feet. There is a table in the report showing that Barclays' pay, measured as a percentage of operating profit, is well below the average of its peers. Second, the rewards in investment banking will always look rich to the outside world. Third, Barclays is not claiming to have completed its overhaul of pay, stating only that it is \"on a journey\" to a point where shareholders collect a fairer share of the spoils. But the journey, for Barclays and its rivals, is taking place in the slow lane. What does a \"multi-year\" adjustment to \"compensation costs\", to benefit shareholders, as Sunderland puts it, mean? If it implies another three years to put the house in order, the destination will be reached eight years after crisis struck. In no other industry would poorly treated investors tolerate such tardiness. The heist is less extreme than in the past, but it's still a heist. How do you solve a problem like RBS? Would our troubles be over if Royal Bank of Scotland were broken up into a good bank and bad bank? That was the course of action the governor of the Bank of England advised this week. The advantage, supposedly, is that the good bank could be returned to the private sector in short order and we'd all gain from having \"a healthy RBS back lending to the economy\". Well, OK, 100% nationalisation of RBS followed by a rapid restructuring was an interesting idea at the outset. But the reasons behind Alistair Darling's rejection of full nationalisation in early 2009 still sound solid. The former chancellor wrote in his autobiography: \"Our gross domestic product (GDP) at that time amounted to about \u00a31.5tn. RBS liabilities were thought to be \u00a31.9tn. What would happen if not only did we have to take on RBS but things got worse and we were required to nationalise Lloyds HBOS, or even Barclays?\" Indeed. The UK in 2009 was not in the same position as Sweden in the early 1990s, where a good bank/bad bank manoeuvre worked wonders. Our banks were colossal relative to the size of the economy and a global recession was running. It was a risk too far. How about splitting up RBS now? It would clearly be safe to do so, and the \u00a38bn-ish expense of buying out minority shareholders is irrelevant in the context of the national debt and the \u00a3375bn programme of quantitative easing. But would there be a real gain? RBS's bad assets have mostly been unwound (\u00a3200bn gone, \u00a360bn to go) and a split would take at least a year to organise. In the interim, RBS's lending in the UK might even shrink. None of which is to deny that institutional apathy about lending to small businesses, established in the boom years, runs deep. But, come on, there are other reasons behind the soggy numbers. Project Merlin, the government's first attempt to improve the flow of credit, was utterly feeble. Lack of competition between banks, which the government has shown no appetite to address, is another reason. And quantitative easing, we can now see, benefits those who don't need loans, such as owners of portfolios of shares or large houses in central London. Higher wages, an ingredient that might boost demand in the economy and thus help to stimulate lending, are missing. Rejigging RBS at this late stage doesn't feel like an answer to any of the big problems. John Lewis likely to beat M&amp;S to \u00a310bn a year sales? \"They fish in a smaller pond and a slightly more exclusive pond. They don't compete, head to head, with Tesco and Asda on things like men's underpants.\" Sir Stuart Rose, former boss of Marks &amp; Spencer, made that lofty comment about John Lewis in January 2008. Half a decade ago, it was indeed possible to regard the two businesses as fishing in pools of different sizes. In terms of annual sales in the UK, the gap between M&amp;S and John Lewis was \u00a32.25bn. Surely that wouldn't be closed in a hurry. Well, it has been \u2013 almost. Amid the hoopla generated by John Lewis's bumper bonus pot for staff this week, the 9% rise in the group's revenues for 2012-13 was almost overlooked. The partners took in \u00a38.46bn. On M&amp;S's current form in the UK (a miserable 0.6% rise in UK retail revenues at the half-year stage), the gap will close to about \u00a30.5bn. An unfair comparison? Not really. The two businesses are very alike. They have a roughly even split between food and non-food sales. True, John Lewis is still smaller in the underpants department and has a broader span of non-food lines; then again, managements are free to adapt, as John Lewis did, getting fast into internet retailing. As M&amp;S shareholders scratch around for an explanation for the company's stagnation, one part of the answer seems straightforward: John Lewis is eating part of its lunch. Which of them will be first to reach the landmark of \u00a310bn of annual revenues in the UK? You'd bet on the partners.",

      "bodyText": "David Cameron was under pressure on Friday to withdraw claims that public spending cuts are not to blame for the UK's economic stagnation after the Treasury's independent economic forecaster said austerity had played a major role in putting the brakes on growth. In an unprecedented move, the head of the Office for Budget Responsibility has written to the prime minister saying the government's austerity programme had knocked 1.4% off GDP in the past two years. Robert Chote, the OBR chairman, was responding to the prime minister's \"no turning back\" defence of the government's economic record in a speech on Thursday. Cameron said the OBR supported No 10's view that the lack of growth since the coalition took office was due to the eurozone crisis, a rise in oil prices and debts from the financial crisis. The letter comes at a crucial time for the government following two years of almost zero growth and only a fortnight ahead of a landmark budget that is expected to determine the future of chancellor George Osborne. Tory backbenchers and business lobby groups have become frustrated with the government's lack of action to boost growth and many were highly critical of the prime minister's no-turning-back speech in which he backed Osborne's refusal to adopt a Plan B. Cameron said: \"As the independent Office for Budget Responsibility has made clear, growth has been depressed by the financial crisis, by the problems in the eurozone and by a 60% rise in oil prices between August 2010 and April 2011. They are absolutely clear, and they are absolutely independent. They are absolutely clear that the deficit reduction plan is not responsible; in fact, quite the opposite.\" But Chote said OBR reports made clear that tax rises and spending cuts in a succession of coalition budgets had hit growth. He said: \"For the avoidance of doubt, I think it is important to point out that every forecast published by the OBR since the June 2010 Budget has incorporated the widely held assumption that tax increases and spending cuts reduce economic growth in the short term.\" In the letter, which the OBR has published on its website, he said calculations based on widely used academic calculations that austerity has reduced economic growth by 1.4% in 2011-12. A Downing Street spokesman said Chote's letter agreed with the PM that external factors held back growth, but he sidestepped the point made by the OBR chief that austerity has also played a part in depressing the economy. The spokesman said: \"The OBR has today again highlighted external inflation shocks, the eurozone and financial sector difficulties as the reasons why their forecasts have come in lower than expected.

In past three months, that pace has picked up to an average of about 195,000 a month.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/\">The Bureau of Labor Statistics</a> said the job gains were made in professional and business services, construction, and healthcare. In a sign of the improving housing market, the construction industry added 48,000 in February. Since September, construction employment has risen by 151,000.</p> <p>There are still major issues in the job market, however. The number of long-term unemployed \u2013 those jobless for 27 weeks or more \u2013 was unchanged in February at 4.8m. These individuals accounted for 40.2% of the unemployed. The unemployment rates for teenagers (25.1%), black people (13.8%), and Hispanics (9.6%) remained high and showed little or no change.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.guprod.gnl/business/2013/mar/08/us-jobless-rate-jobs-february\">More here. </a></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5139f28895cb3037f5c821ed\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-03-08T14:15:36.581Z\">2.15pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">US jobs recovery in historical context</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The US jobs data taken in historical context also lose their sheen.

But, he adds:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The recovery remains on track. Fiscal headwinds will take a toll on growth this year and probably over the next years, too, as the US is finally tackling its deficit problems. Households and companies have used the years of low interest rates and expansive fiscal policy to pay off loans and reduce debt service. Their stronger balance sheets have shielded the economy from the impact of the self imposed fiscal austerity and should allow moderate GDP growth of roughly 2% in 2013.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5139f01eb5799f28f712f0dc\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-03-08T14:05:18.820Z\">2.05pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>And for a more boisterous response to the US jobs data...</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/drlangtry_girl/status/310028160773283840\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Asked chum for his take on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search/%23nfp\">#nfp</a> nos.

The outturn was weaker than the consensus forecast of a 0.5% rise and left the annual growth rate at -1.3%.</p> <p>Admittedly, the data still suggest that Q1 should be much better than Q4. If production was unchanged in February and March, it would have risen by 0.3% in Q1 as a whole \u2013 far better than Q4\u2019s 2.9% drop.</p> <p>But while this suggests that Q4\u2019s 0.6% fall in GDP will not be repeated, it is not consistent with a strong recovery either. This is in line with the message from the composite PMI, which points to modest quarterly gains in GDP of about 0.2%.</p> <p>Further ahead, a further fall in the euro and modest improvement in global demand might mean that the gradual industrial recovery continues. And January\u2019s 1.6% rise in production of consumer goods might suggest that household demand is starting to recover. But with German unemployment now rising and the euro at a high level, we still doubt that the recovery will be as strong as most forecasters expect.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5139ca4695cbb1ba901fefa2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-03-08T11:23:50.757Z\">11.23am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Some reaction on Twitter to those grim UK construction figures (<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2013/mar/08/eurozone-crisis-live-imf-lagarde-ireland?commentpage=1#block-5139bd9f95cbb1ba901fef99\">see 10.32am</a>)...</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/faisalislam/status/309970988555177984\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Triple dip fears in UK, which many hoped had disappeared with better service figures, back on again after bad 6.3 m/m fall in construction..</p>&mdash; Faisal Islam (@faisalislam) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/faisalislam/status/309970988555177984\">March 8, 2013</a></blockquote> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/EdConwaySky/status/309985086718214144\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Construction figures are v volatile month-on-month but even so Jan's output is a horror show.

Reuters reports: Under current EU regulations, absinthe does not have to contain any thujone to justify the name, but also must not exceed a maximum of 35 milligrams of thujone per kilogram. In order to standardise the content, the European Commission has proposed that anything labelled \"absinthe\" must have at least 5 and maximum of 35 milligrams of thujone per kilogram. As is often the case in the European Union, the Germans and the French are on opposite sides of the debate. Francoise Grossetete, a centre-right French parliamentarian, wants to protect the traditional essence of the spirit and is advocating that the new minimum be introduced. German lawmaker Horst Schnellhardt, concerned about the health risks, prefers a definition that would allow something to be called \"absinthe\" even if it contains no thujone at all. To Grossetete, that ignores the essence of the spirit. \"Accepting the sale of a drink under the \u2018absinthe' label without the guarantee that the plant of that name was used to make it amounts to cheating,\" she said. \"Baudelaire would turn in his grave!\" Across the pond, the Dow Jones has opened up 0.6% to hit a fresh high for the fourth straight day after the upbeat jobs report. European markets are also higher on hopes the US can help drive a global recovery. UK FTSE 100: up 0.8%, or 48 points, at 6487 France CAC: up 1.3% Germany DAX: up 0.8% Back to the UK, where the Office for Budget Responsibility has slammed the prime minster's key speech on the economy, in which he quoted the... OBR. Just as a reminder, yesterday David Cameron said: As the independent Office for Budget Responsibility has made clear, growth has been depressed by the financial crisis, by the problems in the eurozone and by a 60% rise in oil prices between Augsut 2010 and April 2011. They are absolutely clear, and they are absolutely independent. They are absolutely clear that the deficit reduction plan is not responsible; in fact, quite the opposite. Today, Robert Chote, chairman of the OBR says: For the avoidance of doubt, I think it is important to point out that every forecast published by the OBR since the June 2010 Budget has incorporated the widely held assumption that tax increases and spending cuts reduce economic growth in the short term. In fact, he says, the OBR calculates that austerity has reduced economic growth by 1.4% in 2011-2012. Well, if the government will let its forecasters have independent views... My colleague Dominic Rushe, over in the US, reports: The US added 236,000 new jobs in February as the unemployment rate edged down to 7.7%, its lowest level since December 2008. The figures easily beat economists' predictions that the US would add 160,000 jobs in February and look set to drive US stock markets to new record highs. This is 29th month in a row that the US has added jobs. On average, 183,000 jobs were added each month in all of 2012. In past three months, that pace has picked up to an average of about 195,000 a month. The Bureau of Labor Statistics said the job gains were made in professional and business services, construction, and healthcare. In a sign of the improving housing market, the construction industry added 48,000 in February. Since September, construction employment has risen by 151,000. There are still major issues in the job market, however. The number of long-term unemployed \u2013 those jobless for 27 weeks or more \u2013 was unchanged in February at 4.8m. These individuals accounted for 40.2% of the unemployed. The unemployment rates for teenagers (25.1%), black people (13.8%), and Hispanics (9.6%) remained high and showed little or no change. More here. The US jobs data taken in historical context also lose their sheen. Calculated Risk has updated its chart that shows the 'recovery' following the most recent financial crisis, compared with recoveries of the past. Bill McBride of Calculated Risk says: This shows the depth of the recent employment recession - worse than any other post-war recession - and the relatively slow recovery due to the lingering effects of the housing bust and financial crisis. Click through to the Calculated Risk blog for a clearer chart. Christian Schulz of Berenberg Bank also sounds a note of caution, in light of the exuberance over the US jobs report. Not all is well in the US. The civilian labour force participation rate reached a new low at 63.5%, the lowest since 1981. 5.9 million more people would be looking for work at the moment, if participation were to return to the peak of 67.3% in early 2000. This could theoretically increase unemployment by a third to almost 12%. In other words, with less people 'participating' in the jobs market, it is easier to have a lower unemployment rate. But, he adds: The recovery remains on track. Fiscal headwinds will take a toll on growth this year and probably over the next years, too, as the US is finally tackling its deficit problems. Households and companies have used the years of low interest rates and expansive fiscal policy to pay off loans and reduce debt service. Their stronger balance sheets have shielded the economy from the impact of the self imposed fiscal austerity and should allow moderate GDP growth of roughly 2% in 2013. And for a more boisterous response to the US jobs data... Chris Williamson of Markit agrees that... The surprising improvement in the health of the labour market does not necessarily mean the Fed will start to look at an exit from its asset buying programme any time soon. He says the numbers give a truer picture of the US economy than grim GDP figures at the end of last year. Importantly, the disappointing stagnation of the economy in the final quarter of last year, when GDP rose at a mere 0.1% annualised rate, painted an unrealistically gloomy picture of the economy. Instead, it is clear that the underlying momentum of the business sector remained healthy at the end of last year, and that that momentum has picked up further in the first quarter. Surveys such as Markit's PMI indicate that manufacturing is growing at its fastest pace for a year, the ISM's non-manufacturing survey continues to register healthy growth and the trend growth in core retail sales has accelerated. These improving trends will reassure policymakers, but caution about the sustainability and robustness of the recovery will no doubt remain the key theme of the Fed's rhetoric Here's Rob Carnell of ING on the US jobs numbers, which he says pushes the US firmly into \u201crecovery\u201d mode. The big story of this report given the Fed\u2019s stated targets, is the fall in the unemployment rate from 7.9% to 7.7%. This came from a combination of a 170K increase in the household survey, following months of weak numbers, and a fall in the labour force of 130K, helping to reduce the unemployment total by 300K. We feel that there isa lot more good news on the unemployment rate to come in the months ahead \u2013 probably as early as next month \u2013 as the household survey still has lots of room for catch up with the non-farm payrolls survey, which it still lags behind. But he sounds a note of caution. With sequestration upon us, and the labour market far from immune, combined with the depressive effect of the payrolls tax cut expiry, we envisage a period of much softer data and rising anxiety as we head towards the May 19 debt ceiling stand-off. Here come the naysayers. James Pethokoukis of CNBC notes the number of long-term unemployed in the US is going up. Here's Newedge Strategy on the US jobs data. They too say the Fed is unlikely to shift course as a result of the numbers. Today\u2019s labour market report confirms that the labour market is progressing in the right direction, albeit at a slow pace. Although the spike in NFP is good news, the unemployment rate is still far from the Fed's 6.5% \"threshold\" that would convince policymakers to withdraw some policy accommodation All in all, a good employment report in February that suggests the US economy is slowly gaining momentum. That said, we remain cautious as headwinds to growth are still well alive. Domestically, the US fiscal situation is far from being clear and risks from abroad remain high, with the EMU debt crisis not at a conclusive turning point yet. In a nutshell, we rule out that today's NFP will change the picture for the economic outlook near term and no impact on the next FOMC decision is expected. And some more Twitter reaction, from leftwing economist Justin Wolfers... The head of the world's largest bond trader Bill Gross says the upbeat US jobs number is unlikely to move the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy, Bloomberg reports. The US unemployment rate has now edged below the UK's, as noted by Sky's Ed Conway. The US jobs data suggests the world's largest economy has enough momentum to ride out the so-called sequester, of higher taxes and deep government spending cuts that came in last week. It is worth noting that economists say the economy needs to add 250,000 jobs a month over a sustained period to significantly reduce unemployment. So the Federal Reserve is unlikely to stop its ambitious stimulus programme just yet. The Fed is buying $85bn in bonds per month and said it would keep the programme going until it sees a substantial improvement in the jobs market. That is a remarkably positive number, beating even the most optimistic of forecasts. So, the monthly change in employment in the US, excluding the farming sector was +236,000. At the same time, the unemployment rate dropped from 7.9% to 7.7%, its lowest level since December 2008. December and January's employment data was revised to show 15,000 fewer jobs added than previously estimated, but details of today's report were solid. Construction, in particular, added the most jobs since March 2007, up 48,000. Gasps around the office. US non-farm payrolls came in at +236,000. That compares with consensus estimates of +160,000. And it's 10 minutes until the US February jobs report. A Reuters report this morning suggested that... Job growth is expected to have advanced at a moderate pace in February, suggesting the economy has enough momentum to withstand the blow from higher taxes and deep government spending cuts. Employers are forecast to have added 160,000 jobs to their payrolls last month, picking up slightly from January's 157,000 count, according to a Reuters survey of economists. Guesses in the office are ranging from 137k to 198k. While Ireland was very much the focus, the crucial point made by IMF chief Christine Lagarde, was that the IMF believes European monetary policy should remain accommodative and the ECB had \"limited\" room to cut rates further. She says restoring the balance in the EU might mean allowing somewhat higher inflation and wage growth in countries like Germany. Lagarde says the EU bailout fund, the ESM, should directly recapitalise Ireland's troubled banks. She says there is a lot to be done on the fiscal union front, and says she will come back to address those issues another day. And with that she is done and receives rapturous applause. Lagarde says: Here in Ireland you saw how failed banks can overwhelm the government. A functioning banking union severs the link, it stops deposit flight and it makes monetary policy work better. It is also an issue of solidarity. Troubled banks become the responsibility of all, not just one. Irish banks were not as well supervised as they should have been. But if they borrowed too much others lent too much. It is two sides of the same coin. We need co-responsibility. It is important to implement that single supervision mechanism. It must have the resources to do the job it is tasked to do. It also needs a single resolution authority that can shut down or restructure banks. It needs a common safety net to sustain confidence. If all of that is put in place this package should be able to eliminate that poisonous cord between sovereigns and banks. She closes by saying Building a stronger eurozone is critically important. In many ways the European economic crisis was a crisis of incomplete integration. The eurozone was a close-knit club but it was not a family. The IMF regards the banking union as a priority. While some are raising the threats of protectionism. Now is the time to move the ball further and deliver on strong and solid architecture for the eurozone. Lagarde says we have to recognise that demand is unbalanced in the EU and needs to be rebalanced. [That] means allowing somewhat higher inflation and wage growth in countries that can afford it (in the North). Which sounds like a dig at Germany. Lagarde says fiscal policy is more difficult. She says spending must go down and not up. But how fast should it go down? The pace should be measured and steady, because it will support the right balance between putting the books in order and supporting the recovery. She says there is flexibility in the pact to accommodate and facilitate that measured and steady path that the IMF recommends. But Lagarde says Europe's achievements are not translating into higher income, more jobs and better growth. It is not yet helping the people, which is what matters at the end of the day. She says macroeconomic policy can help support demand in these circumstances. What does this mean in practice? One is monetary policy the other is fiscal policy. She says monetary policy should remain accommodative and there is still some limited room for the ECB to cut rates further. As and when it considers it is needed. But we note, that there is a bit of that limited room She says the ECB's bond-buying plan, the OMT, can help monetary policy work better. When countries are on the right track they should receive help to regain market access at rates that are 'considerate'. Looking more widely out to Europe, Lagarde says the EU dimension can support the recovery in Ireland. She cites prime minister Enda Kenny: We dwell best deepest in the shelter never in the shadow of others. She says there are other members in a far worse situation that Ireland. What the Euroepans have done together in the last five years exceeds vastly the fears and expectations people had about Europe. She cites the ESM, the agreement to reduce Greece's massive debt burden, improvement to financial regulations. Lagarde says: Ireland should strive to provide high quality public services. That is much easier said than done when you look at budgetary constraints. She says Ireland must concentrate on health and education. On unemployment, she expresses concern about long-term unemployment. People need to be helped to find jobs. Higher growth typically brings higher unemployment. Employment services need to be revitalised. Lagarde says the efforts are paying off. To look at euro area members there are not many that deliver positive growth. The IMF expects Ireland to grow by 1% this year and 2% next. While Ireland is beginning to see the fruits of success, the harvest is yet to come. She does note unemployment, which she says is still cripplingly high at 14.5% and double that for young people. But says it is coming down for the first time in years. Lagarde notes that Ireland has not had the kind of backlash to austerity that other bailed-out countries have suffered. The government took those decisions while retaining social cohesion. Because of this Ireland was able to resist a large increase in poverty. Lagarde says the Irish government never wavered in its commitment to get beyond the crisis. They pulled together in the national interest and made the hard choices. At the root of the problem, she says was a financial crisis made worse by a real estate crisis. I have to point out one thing. The rigour and the vigour with which that was tackled was exemplary. And the stress test has served as a model in other countries. The government also made huge strides on the budget. During the most difficult of times it introduced deficit reducing measures. This is quite a spectacular love-in so far. Presumably she will recognise that the country still has staggeringly high unemployment. IMF chief Lagarde is full of praise for her hosts. Ireland has always exceeded expectations. Time and time again it has bounced back stronger and more confident than before. This time is no different, she says. Irish finance minister Michael Noonan is introducing \"Christine\", as he calls her (repeatedly). Christine Lagarde is about to speak in Dublin Castle on \"Ireland and the European Union\u2014Shared Determination, Shared Destiny\". The rather beautiful hall is packed, and it looks like she is filing in now. TUC economist Duncan Weldon recalls David Cameron's speech yesterday \u2013 in which he slapped down a call by Vince Cable for increased government borrowing to fund capital investment \u2013 suggesting the UK does have a kind of 'magic money tree' and should be using it to support the construction industry. Back to the UK and those grim construction figures (see 10.32am). Catherine McKinnell MP, Labour's shadow treasury minister, says it's more evidence of the government's failing economic strategy. These are shocking figures, which expose how out of touch David Cameron was yesterday to claim his economic plan isn\u2019t failing. We need to kick-start our flatlining economy by investing in infrastructure projects and building thousands more affordable homes. And to get small projects moving too VAT on home repairs, maintenance and improvements should be cut to 5 per cent. These measures would boost growth, create jobs and in the long-term strengthen our economy and help get the deficit down. Labour, business groups, the IMF and now even Vince Cable are calling for action to build our way to a strong and sustained recovery. It\u2019s time the Prime Minister and his downgraded Chancellor realised their plan isn\u2019t working and acted before any more long-term damage is done. Italy may decide to exit the euro or take other drastic action, a German politician and Merkel ally has said, according to Reuters. Rainer Bruederle of the Free Democrats (FDP) told a talk show on Thursday night: The decision to adjust to the common currency is one that Italy has to take for itself, it's not for us to take. If Italy does not want to do that, they have to take the consequences. That could mean that they exit (the euro) or that they take drastic measures. But it's down to Italy to decide that. The FDP is one of chancellor Angela Merkel's junior coalition parties. While we wait for Christine Lagarde to pop up at Dublin Castle (live stream here), here's Capital Economics on the disappointing German industrial figures. January\u2019s stagnation in German industrial production is a blow to hopes that the economy could recover strongly at the start of this year. The outturn was weaker than the consensus forecast of a 0.5% rise and left the annual growth rate at -1.3%. Admittedly, the data still suggest that Q1 should be much better than Q4. If production was unchanged in February and March, it would have risen by 0.3% in Q1 as a whole \u2013 far better than Q4\u2019s 2.9% drop. But while this suggests that Q4\u2019s 0.6% fall in GDP will not be repeated, it is not consistent with a strong recovery either. This is in line with the message from the composite PMI, which points to modest quarterly gains in GDP of about 0.2%. Further ahead, a further fall in the euro and modest improvement in global demand might mean that the gradual industrial recovery continues. And January\u2019s 1.6% rise in production of consumer goods might suggest that household demand is starting to recover. But with German unemployment now rising and the euro at a high level, we still doubt that the recovery will be as strong as most forecasters expect. Some reaction on Twitter to those grim UK construction figures (see 10.32am)... German industrial output was unchanged in January (compared with the previous month), missing forecasts for a 0.5% increase. That follows disappointing factory orders out yesterday, which dropped by 1.9%, compared with hopes of a 0.6% increase. With the eurozone increasingly relying on Germany for growth, this makes uncomfortable reading. We'll have analyst reaction on that as it comes in. It seems IMF chief Christine Lagarde will be speaking again at 11.30. We'll be covering that or you can watch it live. Sticking with the UK, there are some grim figures out about UK construction. The Office for National Statistics said building work slowed down by 6.3% in January. While some of that is likely to be a result of the snow, Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight is still concerned. Even allowing for the fact that activity was likely hit markedly by the snow, this was a pretty worrying performance that bodes ill for the sector\u2019s performance in the first quarter. This was highlighted by the fact that construction output was down by 7.9% from January 2012. Archer says that even though construction only makes up 7% of GDP, the industry can act as a serious drag on growth. That piles on the pressure on chancellor George Osborne to announce some kind of support at the budget later this month to support the industry. We shall see... [Correction: Howard Archer has corrected his comment after it was pointed out last year's snow came in February.] Back to the UK inflation attitudes survey, briefly. It seems the polling company does ask a random selection of people nine questions asked to gauge public knowledge, understanding and attitudes toward the interest rate-setting process of the Bank of England, as well as expectations of interest rates and inflation. One example of a question is: Which of the options on this card best describes how prices have changed over the last twelve months? And the respondent is shown various cards, saying gone up by more than 1% but less than 2%, and so on. The survey also tries to measure the level of satisfaction (or otherwise) with the way the Bank of England is \u2018doing its job\u2019. In addition to these, in February every year the pollsters ask five questions to gauge the perceptions of the relationship between interest rates and inflation and knowledge of who sets rates. There's lots more information here (for anyone who's interested. I fear I may be alone in this). But the big news coming out of Ireland is that.... Christine Lagarde went to the pub last night. The Irish Independent breathlessly reports that Lagarde enjoyed a drink at Doheny and Nesbitt's with finance minister Michael Noonan, posing for photos with regulars, ahead of an early start this morning. Overall Lagarde is sounding very upbeat on what Ireland has achieved. What has been done is huge. The determination showed in implementing the [bailout] programme is extraordinary. I would say more than 2/3 of the work has been done in terms of fiscal policies. But she says there is more to be done on the banking system. Lagarde is asked about the potential for economic relapse. She clarifies that she meant that on a global basis. In Ireland she says she has seen resilience and dedication to the improvement of the situation, \"creating growth and creating jobs and restoring hope\". This is really being done in this country. Sometimes there is a worry about what is at the end of the road. There is clearly hope at the end of this road. Christine Lagarde is giving a press conference over in Dublin, which you can watch on RTE.ie. She says the exit strategy for Ireland should be \"planned, organised so there is predictability\". We are in a dialogue and will continue to be so there is certainty over the terms of the exit. She repeats the idea that there are other options open to Ireland as well as extending the time it has to pay back its loans to the troika. We have an open mind over many of the terms of the exit strategy. As far as the adjustment to the loans. It's not just about extension of the maturity, but certainly it includes that. We will look at that with the troika with, in focus, the imperative of helping Ireland exit successfully the programme it has implemented. Inflation expectations are on the rise in the UK. Britons believe inflation will be 3.6% over the next 12 months, compared with expectations of 3.5% three months ago, according to a Bank of England survey. The survey was carried out by polling company GfK NOP, which asked 3,896 people between February 7 and February 19. (I've called GfK to find out who these people were and what exactly they were asked. My guess is that the average man on the street does not have a particularly strong opinion on where inflation is headed but I may be wrong. Will update when I hear from them.) The Bank of Italy has released some fairly eye-watering statistics, showing bad loans in the country rose 17.5% in January, compared with the same month last year. At the same time, Italian banks cut lending to the private sector, with business lending down 2.8%, and lending to households down 0.6% on the year. That is largely down to a lack of demand, as the eurozone's third-largest economy stays mired in recession. Interest rates on loans in January were below their 2012 average even though volumes declined. Italian bank deposits, however, rose 7.7% in January Bank of Italy says household lending falls 0.6% on year in January Bank of Italy says business lending down 2.8% on year in January There's some rather more cynical comment about the news that Japan has emerged from recession (see 8.33am and here). Here's Paul Donovan of UBS... Cause for wild celebration in Tokyo as the Japanese economy failed to grow at all in the fourth quarter on revised GDP numbers (no growth is good news in Japan). Perhaps more importantly bank lending continues to grow slowly, which means there is a chance monetary policy might work. And there's good news for this blog's regular writer Graeme Wearden, who was highly commended at the UK Press Awards dinner last night, for his coverage of the anti-austerity protests last November and this blog in general. He was pipped to the post for Business and Finance Journalist of the year by Tom Bergin of Reuters for his sterling work uncovering the extent of Starbucks' tax avoidance in the UK. The upbeat Chinese data (see 8.21am) and hopes of a good jobs report out of the US lifted markets this morning. UK FTSE 100: up 0.6%, or 37 points, at 6476 France CAC 40: up 0.8% Germany DAX: up 0.7% Spain IBEX: up 0.9% Italy FTSE MIB: up 0.7% And there was better news out of Japan (which was relegated to being the third-largest economy in the world by China's rapid growth back in 2011). Its government has revised official GDP figures, which now suggest the economy stabilised in the fourth quarter after a brief recession. Initial estimates pointed to a 0.1% contraction, but that has been revised to no change. The Bank of Japan joined the ECB and the Bank of England yesterday in sitting on its hands. But markets expect it to be more aggressive from next month, after new governor Haruhiko Kuroda comes in. There was some upbeat data out of China overnight, with export numbers soaring past forecasts to jump by 22% in February. That suggests global demand is on the mend. But import figures were surprisingly weak, dropping 15.2% from a year earlier, which suggest demand at home could still be a problem. Economists said on balance the data was good news. The world's second largest economy grew by 7.9% in the last quarter of 2012 (from a year earlier), up from 7.4% the previous quarter. Analysts say this data suggests that improvement could continue into the first quarter of this year. Aside from Lagarde's visit to Dublin, there's some economic data to digest today, including the key US jobs report for February. Spain industrial output (January): 8am Switzerland inflation (Februrary): 8.15am EU's Rehn speaks in Warsaw: 9am UK inflation outlook: 9.30am Germany industrial production (January): 11am EU's Almunia speaks in Brussels US non-farm payrolls (February): 1.30pm Good morning and welcome to our rolling coverage of the eurozone crisis and other global economic news. IMF chief Christine Lagarde today touches down in Dublin for an official visit to the bailed-out eurozone state. She sounded an upbeat note ahead of the visit, telling the Irish Times that Europe should do all it can to assist Ireland's return to the financial markets, above and beyond simply stretching out the time it has to pay back the \u20ac30bn it owes the European bail-out funds. She said: I would be cautious not to limit it to an extension. I think it has really been refined yesterday during the discussions as an adjustment that might include very much an extension of the maturities but is not limited only to the extension of maturities. She agrees that pushing out the repayments to the end of the term \u2013 a so-called bullet payment \u2013 is an option, but says there are many others. To the extent that it [a measure] is supportive of Ireland and that it will help smooth the transition into growth and Ireland standing on its own two feet, I think we should explore any avenue. Lagarde will today meet officials from the Irish government, which is hoping to exit its bail-out programme by the end of this year.",
