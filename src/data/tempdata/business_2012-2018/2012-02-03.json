      "body": "<p>There were two major pieces of good news Friday on the US economy. First, there was better-than-expected news from the <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-02-03/u-s-january-ism-non-manufacturing-report-on-business-text-.html\">non-manufacturing survey from the ISM</a>, which added to a very positive sister survey of manufacturing earlier in the week. The combined message that can be drawn from the two surveys is that the US economy grew at the fastest rate for ten months in January. The surveys are broadly consistent with gross domestic product rising at an around 3.0% at the start of the year, setting the scene for a robust first quarter. </p> <p>The ISM survey also brought goods news on employment, with a leap in non-manufacturing headcounts, following a more modest, though still substantial, rise in manufacturing jobs reported earlier in the week. The overall rise in employment was the largest since February 2006, with non-manufacturing jobs also showing the largest increase over that near-six-year period.</p> <p>The good news on jobs kept on coming with the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/feb/03/us-unemployment-243000-jobs-added-january\">publication Friday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the latest data on the US labor market</a>. An improving labor market boosts Obama's re-election chances, given that both his likely Republican opponents have argued that his economic policies have not been working. The data are starting to suggest otherwise.</p> <p>The rise in non-farm payrolls of 243,000 was larger than the consensus of around 150,000, with all of the increase in the private sector (+257,000), and only a small fall in public-sector employment. There was growth in employment across almost all sectors, with especially large increases in manufacturing (+50k), professional and business services (+70k) and leisure and hospitality and even construction (+21k). Non-farm payrolls are now up by nearly 2 million on the year; private-sector job creation of 2.22m far outweighs public-sector job declines of 275,000.</p> <p>These employment numbers are derived from a survey of firms. Data are also reported in the release from a survey of households, which also provides a count of the number of jobs. Employment counts from the firm and establishment surveys often diverge since the coverage is different. (The household survey has a more expansive scope because it includes the self-employed, unpaid family workers, agricultural workers and private household workers, who are excluded by the establishment survey.)&#xa0;According to that measure, which can be pretty volatile, employment has grown by an unlikely 850,000 on the month; but on the year, the increase of 2.3m is very close to that derived from the firms' count.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-385486088\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Global/content/icons/2012/2/3/1328301754416/unemployment-us_uk_460.jpg\" alt=\"Unemployment US/UK\" width=\"460\" height=\"306\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><em>Source: BLS (US); ONS (UK)</em></span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The household survey is also used to calculate the unemployment rate, which fell by more than expected, to 8.3%, the lowest level since February 2009. The number of unemployed also fell, by 340,000 on the month, and is now down by 1.1m on the year. Unemployment rates fell sharply for African Americans (from 15.8% to 13.6%), and somewhat for Hispanics (from 11.0% to 10.5%). Young adults aged 20-24 saw a sharp decline in their unemployment rates, from 14.4% to 13.3% on the month, as did high-school dropouts (13.8% to 13.1%) on the month.</p> <p>Interestingly, the young, minorities and the least educated tend to do worst in slumps \u2013 and benefit, relatively, most in booms \u2013 as their unemployment experience tends to be more cyclically volatile than other groups such as the more highly-educated. So, these are all welcome signs and will alleviate some of the pressure on incomes at the low end of the US scale.</p> <p>Of interest also is how the improvement in the unemployment rate is distributed across states. The latest data we have by states, up to December 2011, shows that 46 states registered unemployment rate decreases from a year earlier, while four states \u2013 Hawaii (6.3% to 6.6%); Illinois (9.2% to 9.8%); Mississippi (10.2% to 10.4%); North Carolina (9.8% to 9.9%); plus the District of Columbia (9.6% to 10.4%) \u2013 experienced increases. Currently, five states have double-digit unemployment rates \u2013 California (11.1%); DC (10.4%); Mississippi (10.4%) and Rhode Island (10.8%). But overall, the improvement is widespread and not limited to a few states, which should also help Obama in November.</p> <p>An especially interesting comparison is between the United States and the United Kingdom, which implemented a package of austerity measures in 2010. US GDP growth for Q4/2011 was +0.7% compared with -0.2% for the UK. Both the UK and the US have large financial sectors and both were highly exposed to a financial sector shock. In March 2008, unemployment rates in the US and the UK were similar (5.1% and 5.2% respectively). The response in the US was for firms to shake out workers at early stages of the recession; thus, unemployment went up to 10% in October 2009 (see graph). UK firms appear to have hoarded labor, and by October 2009, it had only reached 7.9%; but they have now started to shake the tree. </p> <p>So the situation has now reversed itself, and the two series are now moving in the opposite directions \u2013 US unemployment down and the UK's up. We only have data for the UK up to November, as their surveys are small, so they only report rolling three-month averages, but all indications are that the series will cross in the next couple of months.

      "bodyText": "Greek unions and employers' associations have blocked a critical element of a rescue deal put forward by the European Union, accusing negotiators of crippling the economy with wage cuts and tax rises that will undermine growth. In a joint letter to the Greek prime minister, Lucas Papademos, the employers and unions said a cut in the minimum wage was non-negotiable and the focus of talks should switch to the tax system, the complexity of regulation and corruption. Athens is under pressure to wrap up talks on a bond swap and a \u20ac130bn (\u00a3108bn) bailout to avert a chaotic default. But hopes of an imminent deal faded after eurozone finance ministers put off a meeting expected on Monday to finalise the rescue. The ministers may meet later next week instead, said its head, Jean-Claude Juncker. The unions' and employers' statement undermined efforts by the coalition government to agree a package of reforms as demanded by the country's international lenders if Athens is to receive the crucial \u20ac130bn second rescue package. The three main parties in the coalition will meet on Saturday to discuss the situation, though sources close to the talks said a quick resolution was unlikely. The refusal of unions to accept further wage cuts and the discovery earlier in the week of an extra \u20ac15bn hole in Athens's accounts are expected to force negotiators to rethink their tactics over the weekend. The troika of officials from the International Monetary Fund, European Central Bank and EU want Greece to agree a package of spending cuts and reforms before they release the fresh \u20ac130bn of funds. Splits have opened up inside the Greek coalition, which includes right- and leftwing parties, as leaders jockey for position in the runup to the elections scheduled for March. Antonis Samaras, the leader of the conservative New Democracy (ND) party, which is leading in opinion polls, opposes cuts to pensions and to wages in the private sector, which he argues would deepen the current recession. The ND leader joined employers in proposing a salary freeze, though even this plan is rejected by unions, which have already accepted 14% wage cuts. Disagreements within the ranks of the troika have also undermined the talks. The IMF's lead negotiator said earlier this week that the deepening crisis in Greece should persuade negotiators to relent on some cuts in favour of more far-reaching reforms. The EU, with the backing of the German government, has made it clear that Greece must accept severe austerity measures as the price of a bailout. The coalition is ready to agree a framework deal struck last week with banks that hold around \u20ac206bn of the country's debt. The banks are ready to accept a near-70% writedown in their loans to Greece in exchange for new 30-year bonds. Weeks of negotiations with a team of bankers led by Charles Dallara, head of creditors group the International Institute of Finance, were close to being finalised last weekend before the talks became dependent on an agreement with the troika. The government must conclude negotiations on its second rescue package \"that will ensure debt sustainability of the country in the long run, and that will bring remedies to a number of serious problems that the Greek economy has had even before this crisis,\" said Amadeu Altafaj Tardio, spokesman for the EU's monetary affairs commissioner, Olli Rehn. \"And one of the main problems of the Greek economy, as we have said time and again here, is the chronic loss of competitiveness over the past decade,\" Tardio said. \"Therefore all the elements, including elements linked to the labour market, wage formation, are part of these discussions.\" Without the new bailout deal and agreement with lenders, Greece would go bankrupt in March, when it faces a \u20ac14.5bn bond redemption it cannot afford. Government spokesman Pantelis Kapsis said the bond swap deal \u2013 known as the private sector involvement, or PSI \u2013 and the parallel negotiations with the troika were almost complete. \"The PSI, I think, in its basic elements is ready,\" he told Real FM radio, adding that talks with the debt inspectors were \"in the final stage\". He added: \"Within the day, we will have to finalise a series of alternative proposals which will be put before the political [party] leaders so we can take the final decisions.\" A meeting between Papademos and the heads of the three parties in his interim coalition government was expected to be moved from Friday to Saturday, according to government officials. Asked whether there was any alternative plan, Kapsis said that \"there will necessarily be a Plan B\" but that he did not want to discuss what it might be. \"Clearly, if we don't close the deal and we let go and say we will default on our own, we would be heading to an open bankruptcy. But I don't think anyone supports that.\" Speaking from Brussels, Tardio said that while negotiations were \"extremely complex,\" he believed an agreement was within reach \"in the days to come\". Greece has been surviving since May 2010 on rescue loans from a \u20ac110bn bailout package from other eurozone countries and the IMF.

The take-up of super-fast broadband has increased to 400,000 of BT's retail customers, with 95,000 added in the three months to 31 December. Elsewhere, Ian Livingston brought forward his target of generating \u00a36bn in annual underlying earnings by 2013 to the end of this financial year. However, BT said its pension deficit ballooned to \u00a34.1bn due to high inflation and the knock-on effect of the government's quantitative easing measures. Group revenue was \u00a34.8bn for the quarter. Excluding the impact of cuts to mobile termination rates, revenue was down 1.8% in the first nine months, in line to reach BT's target of \u20132% to flat for the full year, and halting years of revenue slides by the end of the next financial year. Profit before tax was up 18% to \u00a3628m for the quarter, while earnings (before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) rose by 3% to \u00a31.5bn in the quarter. Net debt fell 11% to \u00a37.7bn, in line with previous quarters which have seen BT reduce its borrowings by \u00a33.3bn over three years.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "In 2000 it was the $164bn (\u00a3103bn) AOL takeover of Time Warner in America. In 2007 it was the-then Sir Fred Goodwin's \u00a349bn acquisition of ABN Amro that signalled that the markets had peaked and were about to crumble. Every financial crisis has its totemic moment; a decision that even at the time seems to defy logic and in retrospect is seen as an act of gross stupidity. Yet it takes more than one individual banker, no matter how powerful, to make a crisis and when the historians come to chronicle the Great Recession of 2008-09 the list of guilty men and women will include more than one former knight of the realm. Here, then, is a (far from exhaustive) list of those who might be considered most culpable \u2013 who caused, exacerbated or failed to prevent the worst downturn in the global economy since the 1930s. Alan Greenspan Laughably given an honorary knighthood in 2002 for his \"contribution to global economic stability\", Greenspan's responsibility for the crash cannot be underestimated. A fanatical believer in the self-righting qualities of financial markets, he was the bubble king who allowed the dotcom boom of the late 1990s to get out of hand and then, when plummeting share prices pushed the economy into recession, started the whole process off again, this time in the housing market. As chairman of the Federal Reserve, he cut interest rates and left them at rock-bottom levels for two years. Cheap borrowing costs encouraged Americans to load up on debt to buy homes, even when they had no savings, no income and no job prospects. These so-called sub-prime borrowers were the cannon fodder for the biggest boom-bust in US history. The housing collapse brought the global economy to its knees. Sir Mervyn King Britain was mini-me to the US in the days of grand illusion before the crash, having its debt-fuelled party where growth was concentrated in the speculative sectors of housing and finance. King became Bank of England governor in 2003, and while he has subsequently been one of the most pro-active central bankers with a refreshingly robust approach to the banks, the case against him is that he failed to \"lean against the wind\" during the economic upswing, leaving interest rates too low, and then waited too long when the economy was nosediving into its most severe postwar recession before cutting bank rate. Under the government's tripartite system of regulation, the Old Lady was supposed to ensure developments in the City did not pose a systemic risk to the economy. It failed in that task. Gordon Brown We have abolished Tory boom and bust, Brown said repeatedly in his 10 years as chancellor of the exchequer. He hadn't. His last big speech before becoming prime minister, made at the Mansion House in June 2007 just as the financial crisis was about to break, praised the bankers for their remarkable achievements and predicted \"the beginning of a new golden age for the City of London\". It wasn't. Brown presided over the loss of a million manufacturing jobs and an ever-widening trade deficit while cosying up to the City. He used to quip that there were two types of chancellors: those who failed and those who got out in time. He got that one right. Bill Clinton One Democratic president, Franklin Roosevelt, put a cage round Wall Street after its excesses in the 20s led to the Wall Street crash and the Great Depression. Another Democrat, Bill Clinton, gave Wall Street the cage keys. After a fierce lobbying campaign, Clinton agreed to repeal the Glass-Steagall Act, which ensured a complete separation between investment and retail banks. The move heralded the coming of superbanks, huge behemoths that took in retail deposits and used them to take highly-leveraged punts in the markets. To make matters worse, Clinton beefed up Jimmy Carter's 1977 Community Reinvestment Act to force lenders to take a more relaxed approach to disadvantaged borrowers. Liberalised banks plus millions of new sub-prime customers equalled one big problem. Eugene Fama The economics profession failed to cover itself in glory in the run-up to 2007. Not only did economists fail to spot that financial institutions were loading themselves up with vast quantities of toxic sub-prime debt, most of them thought it was theoretically impossible for a crisis to happen. In large part, responsibility for that lies with Fama, a Chicago University economics professor who in the 70s came up with the efficient markets hypothesis (EMH), which stated that financial markets price assets at their true worth based on all the publicly available information, encouraging the belief that the best thing to do was to pile in when prices were rising. Bubble-think, in other words. Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher Just as many trends in modern popular music can be traced back to the Beatles, so politics was shaped by the activities of Reagan and Thatcher, the Lennon and McCartney of deregulation, market forces and trickle-down economics. The changes pushed through in the US and the UK in the 80s removed constraints on bankers, made finance more important at the expense of manufacturing and reduced union power, making it harder for employees to secure as big a share of the national economic cake as they had in previous decades. The flipside of rising corporate profits and higher rewards for the top 1% of earners was stagnating wages for ordinary Americans and Britons, and a higher propensity to get into debt. Hank Paulson The US treasury secretary in 2008, Paulson was the Sir Anthony Eden of the financial crisis. He had all the necessary credentials a Republican president would consider necessary for the job \u2013 chief executive of Goldman Sachs with an MBA from Harvard. He was considered the brightest and best of his generation. Like Eden over Suez, he was faced with a monumental challenge. And he blew it. Paulson's big mistake was to put Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae into conservatorship, wiping out the stakes of those who had invested $20bn in the two government-backed mortgage lenders over the previous 12 months. Unsurprisingly, there was no great rush among private investors to rescue Lehman Brothers when it ran into trouble the following week, and when the US treasury allowed the investment bank to go bust every financial institution in the world was seen as at risk. Fred the Shred destroyed a bank; Paulson triggered the biggest economic downturn since the Great Depression. Kathleen Corbet No rogues' gallery of the crisis would be complete without a representative of the credit rating agencies. These were the bodies that took fees from the banks while giving the top AAA rating to collateralised debt obligations, the hugely complex financial instruments that bundled together the toxic sub-prime mortgages with the sound home loans. Corbet was CEO of Standard &amp; Poor's, the biggest of the rating agencies, and she left her post in a \"long-planned\" move in August 2007 just as the financial markets were shutting down. The justification for the top-notch ratings was that the poor-quality loans would be lost in the mix, but when the crisis broke the reality was more like a food scare, in which supermarkets know there are a few dodgy ready-made meals on their shelves but must bin the lot as they are not sure which ones they are. Phil Gramm \"Some people look at sub-prime lending and see evil,\" said this senator in a debate on Capitol Hill in 2001. \"I look at sub-prime lending and I see the American dream in action.\" Gramm, who thinks Wall Street a \"holy place\", was the main cheerleader in Congress for financial deregulation, putting pressure on the Clinton administration to ease restrictions \u2013 not that it needed much persuading. The fact that he had been the biggest recipient of campaign fund donations from commercial banks and in the top five for donations from Wall Street from 1989 to 2002 was, of course, entirely coincidental. The bankers Was it Fred Goodwin at RBS or Adam Applegarth at Northern Rock \u2013 the first UK high street bank to suffer a full-scale run on its branches since the 1860s? Was it Dick Fuld, the man in charge at Lehman Brothers when it went belly-up? Jimmy Cayne, who spent the first month of the crisis playing bridge rather than running Bear Stearns? Or Stan O'Neal, whose attempts to rid Merrill Lynch of its fuddy-duddy image saddled the bank with $8bn of bad debts? How about Andy Hornby, the whizzkid running HBOS? Or perhaps the man chosen by Gordon Brown to be HBOS's white knight \u2013 Sir Victor Blank, chairman of Lloyds? Choose any one from a very long list.",

However, the banks are still exerting considerable influence over the business \u2013 continuing to press, in particular, for a sale of Game's overseas stores.

    "webTitle": "RBS chairman defends Stephen Hester's near-\u00a31m bonus", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Royal Bank of Scotland's chairman admitted today that bankers' pay was too high \u2013 even as he defended the near-\u00a31m bonus for its chief executive, Stephen Hester. He conceded the bank might look for ways to halt awards of bonuses altogether to avoid the row over pay every January. Sir Philip Hampton admitted the bank, 82% owned by the taxpayer, had underestimated the scale of the reaction to the award of 3.6m shares to Hester \u2013 which he later waived \u2013 but said the decision had been made earlier than usual in an effort to avert speculation about the size of the payout. As he revealed that the government, contrary to claims by ministers, had not tried to intervene to keep the bonus below \u00a31m, Hampton acknowledged that the pay system may need to be changed to make it more acceptable. \"Clearly there's a challenge around the annual bonus,\" he said, indicating that one way might be to put more emphasis on the three-year long-term incentive plan. He stressed no decisions had been made and no particular plan was being worked on. He also quashed speculation that the board had threatened to resign over any intervention. With the focus poised to turn next week to Barclays, which on Friday is expected to report 2011 profits of just under \u00a36bn, the Labour leader, Ed Miliband, called on all banks to \"show restraint\" on payouts. \"This bonus culture has ultimately been corrosive,\" Miliband said, amid speculation that the Barclays boss, Bob Diamond, could be handed \u00a311m in shares and cash. Barclays profits are expected to be down only slightly on last year and the bonus pool in Barclays Capital, the investment banking arm, is thought to be stand at about \u00a31.8bn. \"People who did not cause the financial crisis are paying the price. And many feel that those who did cause the financial crisis are not,\" Miliband said. The RBS chairman, who has also waived a payout of shares potentially worth \u00a31.5m, acknowledged that the gap between top pay and that outside the boardroom was a \"cause for concern\" \u2013 a view he said was shared with other chairmen he talked to. While the debate about bankers' pay rages in the UK, in Spain, it was announced today, bankers working at bailed-out banks are to have their pay capped at \u20ac600,000 (\u00a3500,000) with no bonuses. Hampton insisted that Hester was not overpaid. \"He is doing one of the hardest jobs in the world. He is being paid at the low end of the range,\" he said, adding that Hester was not likely to quit as a result of the row. \"I think and hope he will continue to see it through.\" Hester was parachuted in to run RBS after its taxpayer bailout \u2013 which eventually amounted to \u00a345bn \u2013 in October 2008, a year in which it reported the biggest loss in British corporate history, of \u00a324bn. Hampton also said it was important to \"watch some of the rhetoric around business \u2026 bashing people up who are actually there to help doesn't in itself help.\" It was the move by Miliband on Sunday to call a parliamentary vote on the payment to Hester \u2013 described by Hampton as a \"tough character \u2026 extremely able chap\" \u2013 that ultimately forced the RBS chief executive to waive his award of shares. Even so, in coming weeks Hester could still be awarded shares worth up to four times his \u00a31.2m salary, some \u00a34.8m, in a three-year long-term incentive plan. The bank also faces the prospect of paying out annual bonuses to its investment bankers, from an estimated bonus pool of \u00a3500m, just as bonus deals set up in 2009 fall due. The head of the investment bank, John Hourican, is in line for as many as 21.3m shares worth about \u00a36m and, with every rise in the share price, options that give him the right to buy shares at 28.2p also become more valuable. The share price was 28.69p last night. Hampton would not reveal the size of the bonus pool but said it would be \"a lot down\" on 2011 \u2013 when it stood at \u00a31bn \u2013 and that this would reduce the number of millionaires employed by the bank. He insisted that a banker could not be found to work for the same rate as Bank of England governor Sir Mervyn King, who receives \u00a3305,000, and that Hester would be difficult to replace if he decided to go. Hampton also admitted that the new management team had expected that they would be selling off shares in the bank by 2012 but this now looks unlikely as taxpayers are currently nursing a \u00a320bn loss on their 82% stake. He had earlier told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme: \"Pay has been high for too long \u2026 particularly in the banks, particularly in the investment banks, shareholders have done pretty badly and employees have done pretty well certainly over the last 10 years. \"That needs to be corrected. It actually isn't a society or fairness issue, it's a straightforward business issue. Too much of the money has not been going to the right place,\" he said. \"I recognise absolutely that some of the pay levels are very high, very difficult for people to understand, but by the standards of this market they are not high.\"",

Outplacement firm <a href=\"http://www.challengergray.com/press/PressRelease.aspx?PressUid=211\">Challenger, Gray, Christmas</a> reported a 28% surge in lay-offs in January, traditionally a bad month for jobs.

Alongside manufacturing there was good growth in business services, healthcare, leisure and hospitality and even construction, hard hit by the still lacklustre jobs market.</p> <h2>But don't count your chickens</h2> <p>The recovery in the jobs market is broad, but we have been here before. David Semmens, US economist at Standard Chartered, said we had seen a similar pick-up in the first four months of 2011. Then Japan was rocked by disaster and the European debt crisis took hold, wiping out gains. \"This feels more sustainable but we need a few more months before people really start feeling confident again,\" he said.</p> <h2>Long-term unemployed still hard hit</h2> <p>The plight of the long-term unemployed (those jobless for 27 weeks or more) was little changed.

The report also highlighted the plight of older workers. In the fourth quarter <br>of 2011, more than 42% of unemployed workers older than 55 <br>had been out of work for at least a year, a higher percentage than any other age category.</p> <p>Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics, compare the number of unemployed to the whole US population, not just those potentially in the labour market, and found the ratio is still flat. This suggests there are a lot of people still out there who have given up looking for work and have fallen off the tables.</p> <h2>There's a stark racial divide</h2> <p>The Labour Department still show sharp racial disparities in unemployment rates. In January 2012 the unemployment rate for white men over the age of 20 was 6.9%. For black men it was 12.7.</p> <p>Young people are still suffering, and again black youth is suffering more. Overall the unemployment rate for teenagers was 23.2%. The unemployment rate for white men and women between the ages of 16-19 was 21.1% in January, for blacks it was 38.5%.</p>",

In the fourth quarter of 2011, more than 42% of unemployed workers older than 55 had been out of work for at least a year, a higher percentage than any other age category. Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics, compare the number of unemployed to the whole US population, not just those potentially in the labour market, and found the ratio is still flat. This suggests there are a lot of people still out there who have given up looking for work and have fallen off the tables. There's a stark racial divide The Labour Department still show sharp racial disparities in unemployment rates. In January 2012 the unemployment rate for white men over the age of 20 was 6.9%. For black men it was 12.7. Young people are still suffering, and again black youth is suffering more. Overall the unemployment rate for teenagers was 23.2%. The unemployment rate for white men and women between the ages of 16-19 was 21.1% in January, for blacks it was 38.5%.",

      "bodyText": "Japanese electronics firm Panasonic has nearly doubled its projected net loss for 2011 to \u00a5780bn (\u00a36.47bn) \u2013 the biggest in the company's 95-year history \u2013 as the global economic crisis dampens demand for TVs and mobile phones. Panasonic reported a net loss of \u00a5197.6bn in the three months to December, following \"significant sales declines\" and ongoing restructuring costs following its purchase of Sanyo Electronics in 2009. The company's grim outlook mirrors that of fellow Japanese electronics firm Sony, which on Thursday warned that annual losses would be almost twice as bad as forecast. The embattled electronics companies have been hard hit by weakening demand for TVs, a strong yen, and lower production following the Thailand floods. In October Panasonic forecast losses for the year to March of \u00a5480bn, but its revised estimate of a \u00a5780bn net loss (in the year to March 2012) would eclipse the company's previous worst full year loss of \u00a5427bn in 2002. The company said sales fell 14% in the three months to December 2011 to \u00a51.96bn, compared with \u00a52.28bn in the final quarter of 2010. The fall contributed to a net loss of \u00a5197.6bn in the final quarter of last year, compared with a \u00a540bn net profit in the three months to December 2010. \"The primary causes of this are the global economic slowdown and instability in the financial markets due to the European debt crisis, as well as the extensive supply chain disruption caused by the flooding in Thailand that occurred in October 2011,\" Panasonic said in a statement. Sales of flat-panel TVs and mobile phones plummeted in the period, although sales of PCs and some home appliances enjoyed a small boost. Panasonic moved to shake up its business following the purchase of Sanyo Electronics, including revamping its TV and chip operation and cutting jobs. \"At the core of our latest restructuring was to make our TV unit profitable,\" said the Panasonic president Fumio Ohtsubo on Friday. \"Panasonic's TVs may one day be a case study of a recovery.\" On Thursday Sony reported a \u00a5159bn net loss between October and December as sales fell 17% in a festive period that would usually bring a boost for consumer electronics. Sony increased its forecast loss for the 12 months to March to \u00a5220bn; in November it had predicted a loss of \u00a590bn. The results proved the scale of the challenge ahead for Kazuo Hirai, who will take over as Sony chief executive in April after Sir Howard Stringer announced he was to step aside. Both Panasonic and Sony are in fierce competition with South Korean rival Samsung in the TV market, where prices have tumbled in the past year. Panasonic remains the fourth-biggest TV maker in the world. Far eastern electronics firms are still grappling to recover from the Thai floods in October last year, when many companies were forced to halt production at key manufacturing hubs in the region.",

The fall contributed to a net loss of \u00a5197.6bn in the final quarter of last year, compared with a \u00a540bn net profit in the three months to December 2010.</p> <p>\"The primary causes of this are the global economic slowdown and instability in the financial markets due to the European debt crisis, as well as the extensive supply chain disruption caused by the flooding in Thailand that occurred in October 2011,\" Panasonic said in a statement.</p> <p>Sales of flat-panel TVs and mobile phones plummeted in the period, although sales of PCs and some home appliances enjoyed a small boost.</p> <p>Panasonic moved to shake up its business following the purchase of Sanyo Electronics, including revamping its TV and chip operation and cutting jobs.</p> <p>\"At the core of our latest restructuring was to make our TV unit profitable,\" said the Panasonic president Fumio Ohtsubo on Friday. \"Panasonic's TVs may one day be a case study of a recovery.\"</p> <p>On Thursday Sony reported a \u00a5159bn net loss between October and December as sales fell 17% in a festive period that would usually bring a boost for consumer electronics. Sony increased its forecast loss for the 12 months to March to \u00a5220bn; in November it had predicted a loss of \u00a590bn.</p> <p>The results proved the scale of the challenge ahead for Kazuo Hirai, who will take over as Sony chief executive in April after Sir Howard Stringer announced he was to step aside.</p> <p>Both Panasonic and Sony are in fierce competition with South Korean rival Samsung in the TV market, where prices have tumbled in the past year. Panasonic remains the</p> <p>fourth-biggest TV maker in the world.</p> <p>Far eastern electronics firms are still grappling to recover from the Thai floods in October last year, when many companies were forced to halt production at key manufacturing hubs in the region.</p>",

He is seeking emergency aid for the country's stricken economy from the European Union and International Monetary Fund (IMF). Malev was placed in bankruptcy protection earlier this week when Jan\u00f3s Ber\u00e9nyi, the airline's chairman, said a restructuring plan might attract an outside investor who could keep the company airborne. As recently as Tuesday, Ber\u00e9nyi said: \"We hope we last as long as possible while a new national airline is formed that can perform all the functions currently performed by Malev.\" Now those hopes have been dashed. Observers said the airline's fate was sealed following a ruling by the European commission last month that Budapest withdraw financial support and the airline repay nearly \u00a3250m in state aid received between 2007 and 2010. The grounding of Malev brings an end to 66 years of almost continuous service and throws into focus the wider problems afflicting Hungary, which has been hammered by the financial crisis.

European politicians claim Orb\u00e1n's Hungary has become undemocratic and are demanding that the prime minister be held to account. A fortnight ago, Hungary's government was forced to water down proposals to limit the independence of the central bank in Budapest in order to meet minimum conditions imposed by the EU and IMF for examining a request for an emergency credit line. In a December white paper, the government said the potential loss of the airline, which spent about \u20ac50m a year on air service charges and property fees, could jeopardise the operation of Budapest airport. The airline accounts for 40% of turnover at the airport, which is owned by Germany's Hochtief and four financial partners. Mih\u00e1ly Hardy, a spokesman for the airport, told Reuters: \"If this situation continues for a longer period of time, then we will obviously have to revise our business plans for this year and all our contractual obligations. \"There are some estimates that over 20 or 23 routes of Malev will never be served by other airlines,\" he said.",

Admittedly, the surveys have not been a foolproof guide to the official data recently, and other indicators \u2013 such as the Bank of England's agents' scores \u2013 have been weaker. Nonetheless, it is looking more hopeful that the economy will expand in Q1 and therefore temporarily avoid a technical recession \u2013 although how long this pick-up lasts is another matter.</p> <h2>James Knightley, senior economist at ING</h2> <p>This is the strongest reading since March last year and follows on from a healthy rise in the manufacturing survey on Wednesday. With both series in firm growth territory it offers clear hope that the UK can avoid a technical recession following the drop in GDP in the fourth quarer for 2011. However, we remain cautious that consumer spending still accounts for the best part of two thirds of economic activity and that remains constrained by rising job insecurity and negative real wage growth. That said, with the business expectations component improving nicely it does offer hope that firms will start to hire workers and invest more in the economy and that if the UK does dip into recession it will be shallow.

      "bodyText": "Britain's services sector enjoyed a much stronger start to the year than expected, according to a survey that has boosted hopes recession may still be averted Vicky Redwood, chief UK economist at Capital Economics Together with the rise in the manufacturing PMI, this means that a weighted average of the CIPS surveys is now consistent with quarterly GDP growth of about 0.7%. Admittedly, the surveys have not been a foolproof guide to the official data recently, and other indicators \u2013 such as the Bank of England's agents' scores \u2013 have been weaker. Nonetheless, it is looking more hopeful that the economy will expand in Q1 and therefore temporarily avoid a technical recession \u2013 although how long this pick-up lasts is another matter. James Knightley, senior economist at ING This is the strongest reading since March last year and follows on from a healthy rise in the manufacturing survey on Wednesday. With both series in firm growth territory it offers clear hope that the UK can avoid a technical recession following the drop in GDP in the fourth quarer for 2011. However, we remain cautious that consumer spending still accounts for the best part of two thirds of economic activity and that remains constrained by rising job insecurity and negative real wage growth. That said, with the business expectations component improving nicely it does offer hope that firms will start to hire workers and invest more in the economy and that if the UK does dip into recession it will be shallow. It also makes it likely that QE is expanded by \u00a350bn rather than \u00a375bn next week by the BOE. David Tinsley, UK economist at BNP Paribas The doomladen forecasts of recession in the UK are further cast into doubt today by a surge in the UK services PMI in January ...

The degree to which this persists is uncertain,\" he said.</p> <p>NIESR urging the government to loosen its fiscal stance and shore up faltering demand. It argues the government could easily afford to invest enough money, for example in infrastructure projects such as road-building, to avert recession this year without denting its credibility in financial markets or doing any long-term damage to the public finances.</p> <p>Jonathan Portes, the NIESR's director, said not wavering from the government's path was \"accepting a significant degree of long-term economic and social damage\" and that investing to boost demand was as much about creating jobs as boosting growth. \"It's not primarily about bigger growth next year. It's about the long-run economic and social damage ... that we are deliberately doing,\" he said.</p> <p>UK unemployment at 8.4% is at its highest since 1995. NIESR predicts a peak of 9.1% in late 2012 and averaging 8.9% over the year, equivalent to some 3 million people.</p> <p>That forecast for lengthening dole queues is accompanied by predictions of a slight rise in net trade, but merely because of a drop in imports from a faltering economy rather than any upturn in exports. Consumer spending is expected to make a slight contribution to the overall economy, however, as easing inflation boosts families' disposable incomes.</p> <p>Adam Posen, a Bank of England policymaker, warned separately that the central bank may need to pump more electronic money into the economy if the outlook remained depressed. He argued that quantitative easing had helped the recovery and that he was prepared to vote for more if it became clear the UK economy was entering another recession.</p> <p>At a conference organised by the TUC to discuss the future of banking, Posen also raised concerns about credit constraints on businesses. He had put forward plans last year for a new agency or bank to offer credit to small and medium-sized businesses, which was endorsed in principle by the chancellor, George Osborne. But yesterday he said he was disappointed that the momentum behind the proposal, which aimed to kickstart growth among smaller companies, had dissipated in recent months.</p> <p>NIESR shares the view of most economists that there is more QE to come against the backdrop of what it sees as a virtually flat economy in 2012. That economic outlook is a stark downgrade from the thinktank's October forecast for 0.8% growth, which was based on the assumption that the eurozone debt crisis would be resolved sooner rather than later. At the time it also published a 0.2% growth forecast based on a scenario in which eurozone policymakers \"muddle\" through the crisis through much of 2012.</p> <p>It now sees such a \"muddle through\" scenario as more likely and forecasts recession for the eurozone, with contraction there of 0.2% this year. That assumes a \"delayed but ultimately successful resolution\" to the crisis. But there are upside and downside risks to that forecast, NIESR's economists stressed, notably that a disorderly breakup of the euro would likely lead to a \"considerably more severe downturn\".</p> <p>For the wider world economy NIESR predicts relatively modest growth of 3.5% in 2012, with the US and Canada enjoying slightly stronger prospects than Europe and Japanese growth being supported by post-earthquake reconstruction projects.</p>",

In a blow to the coalition government, official figures last week indicated the UK already contracted in the final quarter of 2011.

That forecast for lengthening dole queues is accompanied by predictions of a slight rise in net trade, but merely because of a drop in imports from a faltering economy rather than any upturn in exports. Consumer spending is expected to make a slight contribution to the overall economy, however, as easing inflation boosts families' disposable incomes. Adam Posen, a Bank of England policymaker, warned separately that the central bank may need to pump more electronic money into the economy if the outlook remained depressed. He argued that quantitative easing had helped the recovery and that he was prepared to vote for more if it became clear the UK economy was entering another recession. At a conference organised by the TUC to discuss the future of banking, Posen also raised concerns about credit constraints on businesses. He had put forward plans last year for a new agency or bank to offer credit to small and medium-sized businesses, which was endorsed in principle by the chancellor, George Osborne. But yesterday he said he was disappointed that the momentum behind the proposal, which aimed to kickstart growth among smaller companies, had dissipated in recent months. NIESR shares the view of most economists that there is more QE to come against the backdrop of what it sees as a virtually flat economy in 2012. That economic outlook is a stark downgrade from the thinktank's October forecast for 0.8% growth, which was based on the assumption that the eurozone debt crisis would be resolved sooner rather than later. At the time it also published a 0.2% growth forecast based on a scenario in which eurozone policymakers \"muddle\" through the crisis through much of 2012. It now sees such a \"muddle through\" scenario as more likely and forecasts recession for the eurozone, with contraction there of 0.2% this year. That assumes a \"delayed but ultimately successful resolution\" to the crisis. But there are upside and downside risks to that forecast, NIESR's economists stressed, notably that a disorderly breakup of the euro would likely lead to a \"considerably more severe downturn\". For the wider world economy NIESR predicts relatively modest growth of 3.5% in 2012, with the US and Canada enjoying slightly stronger prospects than Europe and Japanese growth being supported by post-earthquake reconstruction projects.",
