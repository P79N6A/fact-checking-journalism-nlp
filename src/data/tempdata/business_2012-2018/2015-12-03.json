      "bodyText": "It\u2019s hard to know who is most to blame: Mario Draghi, for leading investors up the garden path; or investors, for believing that the European Central Bank president\u2019s talk of doing \u201cwhat we must\u201d equated to a firm promise of a bigger dose of quantitative easing. Either way, the marriage of a teasing central banker and a gullible set of investors produced an ugly stock market on Thursday. The French and German markets fell 3.6% and even the FTSE 100 shed 146 points, or 2.3%. On balance, you\u2019d mostly blame the investors. The eurozone economy has been chugging along at a quarterly growth rate of roughly 0.3% for the past 18 months. That\u2019s not a good performance, but neither is it so awful that the ECB had to reach for the emergency button. Thus the ECB\u2019s compromise decision \u2013 no increase in the \u20ac60bn-a-month size of the asset-purchase programme, just an extension by six months \u2013 was always a reasonable possibility. The market just got its odds wrong: it had \u20ac75bn-a-month, or more, as a nailed-on heavy favourite. But we can draw two other conclusions from the mini-drama. First, financial markets remain addicted to the quantitative easing drug, at least in Europe. That\u2019s alarming if, as now seems possible, the ECB\u2019s enthusiasm is waning under German pressure, to be replaced by more urgent calls for politicians to apply fiscal remedies and structural reforms. Second, unfairly or not, Draghi\u2019s authority has suffered a heavy blow. In the market\u2019s eyes, a central banker is only as trustworthy as his or her last communication. Next time the ECB wants to talk down the euro, Draghi will struggle. Purplebricks is worth a look At first glance, a \u00a3240m valuation for Purplebricks, one of the new breed of online estate agents, is ludicrous. The business launched in April last year and is already being valued at half debt-free Foxtons\u2019 market capitalisation (\u00a3500m), or more than a quarter of the giant Countrywide\u2019s (\u00a3900m). Moreover, readers of Thursday\u2019s announcement of Purplebricks\u2019 plan to float on the Alternative Investment Market were not told basic financial information, such as turnover and profits; those numbers are published later in the process. In the meantime, it is almost meaningless to boast that revenues in September 2015 were ten times greater than in September 2014 when you\u2019ve been operating for only 19 months. Back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest Purplebricks is still a small business. It has 4,300 properties on its books for sale and if each generates revenue of about \u00a31,000 via the low-fee model, that produces \u00a34.3m. Even if the stock turns over 10 times in a year (ie each property sells in about five weeks), that\u2019s \u00a343m of revenue at the current pace. So a \u00a3240m valuation would represent almost six times revenues \u2013 aggressive even for a business with the magical \u201cdisruptive\u201d label. What\u2019s more, the stated gross profit margin of 59% excludes the cost of TV advertising, which doesn\u2019t come cheap and is Purplebricks\u2019 main medium for building its brand. But, actually, knee-jerk scepticism is probably the wrong response. That \u00a3240m price-tag is not plucked out of the air. The company has just raised \u00a325m via an institutional placing at that valuation. True, some investors also took the opportunity to sell \u00a333m-worth of stock, but there has hardly been a rush for the exit. The biggest shareholder, lauded long-termist Neil Woodford, via his funds, roughly maintained his stake at 29%. Chief executive and founder Michael Bruce has 17%. And chairman Paul Pindar, an old hand from Capita, has 4.5%. Aside from heavyweight backing, the other reason Purplebricks is worth a look is the business model, which looks a genuine threat to traditional estate agents charging commission of between 1% and 3%. Purplebricks\u2019 flat-fee averaging \u00a31,080 undercuts the old brigade by a wide margin. The cleverer bit, though, is that the business does not dispense with human beings. It calls itself a \u201chybrid,\u201d using what it calls \u201clocal property experts\u201d (in practice, self-employed former estate agents) to do valuations and the hand-holding work. That looks smarter than an online-only approach. The comfortable world of estate agencies has looked ripe for reinvention, to the benefit of customers, ever since the internet came along but it has never quite happened. (Rightmove and Zoopla don\u2019t count because they merely grabbed agents\u2019 marketing budgets, rather than cut fees for punters). One of these days, someone will crack it, which is why so many online outfits are having a go. There are no guarantees, but Purplebricks looks well placed. Bank branches face uncertain future Antony Jenkins says he was surprised when he was sacked as chief executive of Barclays in July. He shouldn\u2019t have been. The rumours had been around for weeks; the share price was going nowhere; and a punchy new chairman, John McFarlane, had just arrived. The more interesting part in Jenkins\u2019 interview with the BBC, however, was his prediction that 20-50% of bank branches in the UK will close in the next decade, largely because of the rise of new technology. Jenkins made comments along the same lines when he was in the job, but a figure of up to 50% is a substantial upgrade. One suspects he\u2019s close to the mark, and that most bank chiefs would agree but don\u2019t dare say so. Closing branches is banking\u2019s next big challenge \u2013 a political storm is guaranteed.",

The chair of the US central bank told Congress\u2019s joint economic committee that unemployment had lowered to 5%, economic growth was continuing well and she was confident that inflation would return to the Fed\u2019s 2% target. \u201cI currently judge that US economic growth is likely to be sufficient over the next year or two to result in further improvement in the labor market,\u201d she said on Thursday. \u201cOngoing gains in the labor market, coupled with my judgment that longer-term inflation expectations remain reasonably well anchored, serve to bolster my confidence in a return of inflation to 2%.\u201d Yellen did not specifically address the probability of the Fed increasing interest rates at its next policy meeting on 15-16 December, but she said fresh data since the policymakers\u2019 last meeting had been \u201cconsistent\u201d with the Fed\u2019s rate hike criteria. In a speech on Wednesday, Yellen said the US had \u201crecovered substantially since the Great Recession\u201d and she was \u201clooking forward\u201d to increasing rates, which have been held at near zero since the 2008 financial crisis. Economists expect the base rate to be hiked by 25 basis points, and be the beginning of a slow cycle of policy tightening that will likely mean rates will be kept below previously normal levels for years to come. Yellen said that maintaining very low rates would encourage consumers and businesses to continue borrowing. \u201cWith the federal funds rate near zero, we can respond more readily to upside surprises to inflation, economic growth and employment than to downside shocks,\u201d she said. \u201cThis asymmetry suggests that it is appropriate to be more cautious in raising our target for the federal funds rate than would be the case if short-term nominal interest rates were appreciably above zero.\u201d She warned that any further delays to raising rates could be detrimental to the economy. \u201cWere the FOMC [Federal Open Market Committee] to delay the start of policy normalization for too long, we would likely end up having to tighten policy relatively abruptly to keep the economy from significantly overshooting both of our goals,\u201d she said. \u201cSuch an abrupt tightening would risk disrupting financial markets and perhaps even inadvertently push the economy into recession. Yellen and other members have previously indicated that a rates raise \u2013 the first since 2006 \u2013 is likely to come at the December meeting. However, she warned that any substantial changes to the global economy before then could delay the rate rise. Many had expected rates to rise in September, but such a move was nixed by concerns about the faltering Chinese economy. Yellen said she was heartened by continued improvements in reducing the unemployment rate, which has fallen to 5% from a peak of 10% in October 2009 during the fallout of the financial crisis. US employers added 271,000 jobs in October, the most of any month so far this year, and the unemployment rate has fallen to 5%. ADP figures show private sector employers added 217,000 jobs in November \u2013 the most for five months. Government figures for November employment are due to be released on Friday.",

The firm, which launched in April last year, has raised \u00a358m from selling shares to institutional investors. The shares are expected to start trading on London\u2019s alternative investment market on 17 December. The IPO will raise \u00a325m for the company while some of the directors and early backers are cashing in shares worth \u00a333m. Purplebricks is the first of a series of online estate agents to debut on the stock market. By offering a web-based service, they are cheaper than traditional estate agents. Woodford will remain the company\u2019s biggest shareholder after the flotation, with a stake of 28.7%. Other investors include Paul Pindar, the retired chief executive of outsourcing group Capita, and Errol Damelin, the founder of payday lender Wonga. Purplebricks currently lists 4,300 residential properties for sale, and said its market share among the top six online estate agents had grown to more than 60%. Undercutting traditional agencies, Purplebricks charges a flat fee of \u00a3665 plus VAT for a sale in the UK, apart from certain London postcodes where it charges \u00a3965 plus VAT. There are additional charges for arranging viewings or energy performance certificates. Unlike many of its online rivals, which include eMoov, Housesimple and easyProperty, Purplebricks has a network of 165 local agents who visit properties and provide valuations and are on call 24 hours a day, although it does not have any branches. It started offering lettings in London in the summer. Last month, the business launched in Scotland and wants to use the money raised in the IPO to boost its presence there and in London, and to roll out lettings across the UK, by investing in more agents, the brand and its technology. Michael Bruce, the chief executive and co-founder, said Purplebricks was also looking to expand abroad, such as in the US, Australia or France, where traditional estate agents\u2019 fees are high, at about 5% to 6% of the sale price. He said that as well as being cheaper, his service makes buying, selling and letting property easier and faster.

Estate agents\u2019 fees on the buying, selling and letting of properties in the UK total more than \u00a34.4bn a year.

    "webTitle": "ECB Day: markets tumble as Draghi disappoints investors - as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "And finally.... European stock markets have posted their biggest losses in over two months. Shares fell sharply after Mario Draghi failed to deliver the major stimulus packages which had been expected. The wave of selling rippled from Frankfurt and Paris to Madrid and Milan, as traders expressed disappointment that the ECB hadn\u2019t expanded its QE programme, or hit the banks with tougher negative interest rates. Every share on the German DAX closed slower, sending the index down by 3.5% -- which looks like its biggest one-day decline since mid-September. The London also fell sharply in sympathy. The FTSE 100 shed 145 points, or over 2%. The euro, though, continues to drive higher - and is currently up around 3%. Tony Cross of Trustnet Direct says the ECB triggered a wave of selling. All eyes were on the ECB and the expectation that Mario Draghi would unleash some weighty stimulus measures in another attempt to kick-start the Eurozone economy. Although the deposit rate was cut, the market had been factoring in a drop of more than the delivered 10 basis points here, whilst the extension of the bond-buying programme had been fully priced in, too. The result has been a sweeping sell-off for stocks, both within the Eurozone and also in the UK. While Jasper Lawler of CMC Markets explains how the ECB came up short, despite announcing new stimulus measures. Every metric of the ECB\u2019s easing was less than expected by markets. The ECB cut the deposit rate by the minimum amount expected, extended the length of QE program by six months when the market was looking for 12 months and expanded the pool of assets available for purchase without increasing the size of monthly purchases. That\u2019s all for today. My earlier summary explains the main action today. We\u2019ll be back tomorrow morning for another big day - with the latest US jobs report on the agenda. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW Jens Nordvig, analyst at Japanese bank Nomura, reckons the ECB\u2019s hawks refused to accept deeper stimulus measures today: Our economics editor, Larry Elliott, reckons the euro\u2019s rally will be short-lived: The euro had been pushed lower and stock markets had been driven higher in expectation that the ECB would do something meaningful. When it didn\u2019t, the markets unwound the positions built in advance of Draghi\u2019s announcement. The smart money will be on the euro\u2019s rise being temporary. After all, it is widely expected that the Federal Reserve will raise US interest rates for the first time since 2006 when it meets this month. But talk of a further big plunge in the euro look overdone. An increase in US borrowing costs is already in the price. And Draghi has shown all too vividly that the hints of central bankers \u2013 even the biggest hints \u2013 should be treated with some caution. Here\u2019s his analysis of today\u2019s news: Here\u2019s Reuters\u2019 take on the surging euro: The euro was on track for its biggest daily gain since mid-March on Thursday as a series of stimulus measures announced by the European Central Bank failed to live up to market expectations. The ECB extended its asset-purchase programme, known as quantitative easing, by six months to March 2017, but did not beef up monthly purchases as many investors had hoped. It also agreed to buy euro-denominated municipal and regional bonds and cut its deposit rates by 10 basis points to -0.30%, although this was slightly less than money markets had priced in. The single currency hit a four-week high of $1.0894 after the announcement, up over 2 percent on the day, while euro zone stocks shed 2 percent as they headed for their biggest daily drop since September. Ten-year euro zone government bond yields rose 10-20 basis points, with Italy\u2019s near a one-month high after a 28 bps rise to 1.66%. Money market rates rose. Stephan Rieke, senior economist at German private bank BHF-Bank, said: \u201cThe markets were very ambitious with respect to the measures the ECB would possibly take and are now disappointed.\u201d And here\u2019s today\u2019s euro/US dollar spike, from below $1.06 to over $1.08. Money continues to pour into the euro, sending the single currency to a one-month high against the US dollar. The euro has gained almost two and a half cents, which is its biggest one-day move since March this year. Reto Foellmi, Professor of International Economics at the University of St Gallen in Switzertland, isn\u2019t impressed by the cut in bank deposit rates. He argues it will not encourage banks to lend more: \u201cI doubt the success of lowering already negative interest rates in the Eurozone. Negative interest rates typically increase the associated hedging costs for banks. Tighter bank regulation has reduced bank\u2019s risk appetite. Both effects work against higher lending rates for the private sector. So, this is not really a stimulus for the economy\u201d. Sorry, I\u2019m a bit late with this, but Mario Draghi\u2019s statement is online here: Introductory statement to the press conference It outlines the various stimulus measures taken today, the new staff forecasts (growth up a bit, inflation down a bit), and the ECB\u2019s concerns about \u201csubdued growth prospects in emerging markets and moderate global trade\u201d. As usual, Draghi also urges elected politicians to reform their economies faster. The Greek finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos in an interview with the Guardian has rubbished the idea that Athens\u2019 left-wing government is all for unions staging general strikes \u2013 as a budget saving measure. The Greek finance minister was speaking as the country was hit by another 24-hour walkout. He firmly quashed media reports that Athens\u2019 Syriza-led coalition is secretly supportive of unions walking off the job. In an exclusive interview Tsakalotos labelled the very notion that the government might see such action as a cost-cutting measure as vaguely absurd. \u201cI don\u2019t think that has passed anybody\u2019s mind, it certainly hasn\u2019t passed the minister of finance\u2019s mind\u201d. But the Oxford educated economist added that - as a leftist - he was not unsympathetic to popular protests even if, he said, they were not always constructive. \u201cI am not unsympathetic to any social movement because I am a left-wing person and think their independence is absolutely critical to the character of social and economic life. I don\u2019t think a left-wing government can actually function without social movements that pressurize it and act as a counter balance to other political forces.\u201d Greek unions, who are considering calling another general strike before Christmas, estimated that today\u2019s protest rally drew a crowd of not more than 40,000. \u201cIt was smaller than we expected,\u201d Odysseus Trivalas, who heads the civil servants\u2019 union ADEDY said of the turn-out. \u201cWe think it is partly because it was organised in such short time and that people are clearly tired \u2026 but the government should know that these policies cannot continue. We will be taking to the streets again.\u201d UK factory bosses should put Mario Draghi on their Christmas card list. Sterling has dropped by two euro cents against the euro today, making UK exports more competitive. Simon French of stockbrokers Panmure Gordon says: This is good news for the UK manufacturing sector who have been struggling against a weak Euro that is damaging competitiveness. You could argue that the financial markets are the ones who messed up, not the European Central Bank. As Stewart Robertson, senior economist at Aviva Investors points out, the ECB has taken several new steps to help the euro economy today. Investors just expected even more. The only area it didn\u2019t really deliver on today was the amount of monthly purchases [via QE]. It has cut the deposit rate, expanded the range of instruments it can buy and extended the possible end date by six months from September 2016 to March 2017. If it had said nothing (in October) and delivered this today, the market reaction would have been very different. And after all, the Euro is still much lower today than it was before Draghi\u2019s \u201cpre-announcement\u201d in October. My colleague Heather Stewart has written a new story on how Draghi disappointed the markets. Here\u2019s a flavour: Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, has dashed investors\u2019 hopes of a significant expansion of its quantitative easing programme to boost the flagging eurozone economy. The euro jumped on foreign exchanges during Draghi\u2019s press conference in Frankfurt, as he said the ECB had decided to cut the deposit rate on bank reserves, and extend QE by six months \u2013 but would not step up the pace of bond buying. The ECB said it would cut the deposit rate on reserves held at the central bank to -0.3%, from -0.2%. At the subsequent press conference on Thursday, Draghi said the ECB would extend its quantitative easing programme \u2013 aimed at boosting inflation and bolstering growth \u2013 by six months, to March 2017. But the 0.1 percentage point cut in the deposit rate was smaller than investors expected, and the pace of bond buying will remain at \u20ac60bn a month, which could suggest more sceptical members of the ECB\u2019s governing council, such as Bundesbank president Jens Weidmann, blocked a more aggressive cut..... Here\u2019s the full story: Alberto Gallo, head of global macro credit research at RBS, has an unconventional take on today\u2019s events: Here\u2019s a quick summary of the main points, and an early stab at some analysis. The European Central Bank has cut the interest rate which eurozone banks pay on their deposits at the ECB. It has been slashed deeper into negative territory, but not by as much as expected. The deposit facility rate has been lowered to minus 0.3%, not the minus 0.4% which some economists had forecast. This makes it even less attractive to leave cash lying around at the ECB, rather than lending it to consumers and businesses across the eurozone. The ECB has made three changes to its quantitative easing programme, which injects new money into the system by buying assets from banks It will be extended, by six months to March 2017. As bonds bought under QE mature and are paid back, the ECB will reinvest the proceeds in new debt. That means it is promising to provide extra liquidity for longer than before. It has extended the range of assets which can be mopped up -- to cover debt sold by regional governments. But the ECB has not raised the pace of QE - it will continue to buy \u20ac60bn of assets, dashing hopes that it would crank up the printing presses. Especially as the ECB has lowered its inflation forecasts, admitting that prices will remain subdued for even longer. Investors are giving Draghi the thumbs-down - driving the euro up by 2% against the US dollar to $1.08. Stock markets have plunged sharply, with Germany\u2019s DAX shedding 3% at one stage. Why? Because Draghi and colleagues had dropped so many hints that they would act decisively today. As Capital Economics put it - investors will reach for the salt bucket the next time Draghi opens his mouth. So what went wrong? Draghi admits that today\u2019s decisions were not unanimous. That suggests that hawks on the governing council dug their claws in, and refused to allow more decisive action. But they may have a point. As Draghi pointed out - the eurozone economy is growing, credit conditions are improving. QE is working, and they\u2019ll keep doing it. Why bring out a bigger punchbowl? And he also left one weapon in his knapsack; by repeatedly ducking questions on whether interest rates are now at the \u2018lower bound\u2019 (the point where they cannot be cut again). Draghi isn\u2019t ruling out further action in the months ahead. Finally, he has also delivered an early Christmas present to Fed chair Janet Yellen. By easing policy by less than expected, the ECB has given the US central bank more leeway to tighten US monetary conditions. An American rate hike in two weeks time looks even more likely now. Press conference over, summary to follow.... Finally, a question about the euro, which has bounced away from near-parity against the US dollar today. Does the ECB have concerns about the exchange rate? Draghi sticks to the standard answer - that the exchange rate is not a policy target, but it\u2019s an important factor in monetary policy, and the ability of the ECB to transmit its measures to the real economy. Q: What impact will the Paris terrorist attacks have on the eurozone economy? Short answer, we don\u2019t know, Draghi replies. The future is full of geopolitical risks. That\u2019s why \u201cthere is confidence, but there is no complacency\u201d at the ECB. Mario Draghi appears to have over-promised and under-delivered, says Ben Brettell, Senior Economist at Hargreaves Lansdown. Brettell sums up the gloomy mood: Markets expected Draghi to deliver a combination of rate cuts and tweaks to the ECB\u2019s QE programme. The deposit rate for commercial banks was already in negative territory at -0.2% and analysts had predicted a cut of between 0.1 and 0.2 percentage points. The cut to -0.3% therefore left markets somewhat underwhelmed. The other two key interest rates were left unchanged. Far more exciting for the markets were the expected tweaks to QE in the subsequent press conference. The current programme of \u20ac60 billion of asset purchases per month has been extended by six months, to March 2017 (or beyond if necessary). ECB has also expanded the range of assets being purchased, to include regional and local government debt. However, this does little to provide an immediate boost to the economy. Markets had been hoping for an acceleration of QE, i.e. an increase to the \u20ac60 billion monthly figure. The disappointment in financial markets is palpable this afternoon. The euro has strengthened (which won\u2019t help the euro zone economy) and stock markets have fallen on the announcements. Mario Draghi is repeatedly denying that the European Central Bank is indulging in \u2018monetary stimulus\u2019 through its QE scheme. Some journalists are concerned that the ECB might break its mandate by taking government debt onto its balance sheet. They fear that this means some eurozone countries (perhaps Germany, to take a completely random example) might end up paying off the debts of others. Draghi is adamant that this isn\u2019t happening. Pensioners should be worried by the ECB\u2019s decision to take more stimulus measures today, argues Charles Cowling, director at JLT Employee Benefits: \u201cThe ECB\u2019s extension of its QE programme is not a surprise, given the continued weakness in the Eurozone economy and the lack of inflationary pressure. However, this is bad news for pension schemes as it suggests the ECB feels interest rates may stay very low for longer than expected. Our research, launched in October, suggested that a delay of 12 months in interest rates rising could see total UK pension scheme deficits balloon by \u00a362bn. Draghi is insisting that today\u2019s decision to roll-over QE bonds, to buy new ones when old ones mature, is a big step. Another development - the ECB will no longer discuss monetary policy with City institutions in the run-up to major announcements. This follows concerns over contact between ECB officials and hedge funds and the like -- on one occasion, a speech was not released to the public until many hours later. Draghi has insisted that the ECB will not run out of assets to buy through its QE programme. Bonds are there to be bought, he declares. Jonathan Loynes of Capital Economics says the ECB\u2019s limited new stimulus measures are a serious disappointment. Draghi\u2019s reputation could suffer, he adds: This will be seen as a clear disappointment in the light of the repeated extremely dovish signals from the President and his colleagues. That is clearly evident in the reaction of the euro, which has unwound the falls of the last month in response to the announcements, and the jump in bond yields. In short, the ECB has comprehensively failed to live up to its own hype and markets and forecasters will take future communications from Mr Draghi and colleagues with a corresponding bucket of salt. European stock markets are in retreat, plunging sharply as investors rapidly digest the news out of Frankfurt. Germany\u2019s DAX is leading the selloff, shedding more than 3%. France\u2019s CAC is down 2.8%. Traders are reacting to the jump in the euro, which is still up over 2% after the ECB launched less stimulus than expected. A strong euro is bad for eurozone exports. The selloff is because: Analysts had expected a deeper cut on the ECB\u2019s deposit facility rate, to minus 0.4%, so minus 0.3% is a blow. They also expected a boost to QE, from \u20ac60bn of bond purchases per month to perhaps \u20ac75bn. This simply hasn\u2019t happened - and the six-month extension to QE is a poor substitute. We\u2019re not excluding the use of other instruments, if needed, Draghi says. Q: Did you make a mistake in your communication strategy, Mr Draghi, or did you overestimate your ability to persuade your colleagues to do more? They were not unanimous, Draghi reveals, but there was a very large majority in favour. He doesn\u2019t reveal who dissented - but Germany\u2019s central bank chief, Jens Weidmann, is an obvious candidate We think the 10 basis point in the deposit facility rate is \u201cadequate\u201d, Draghi concludes. Q: The financial markets are disappointed, so why didn\u2019t you do more? Why didn\u2019t you raise the pace of QE bond-buying above \u20ac60bn/month. Mario Draghi says that the ECB analysed the situation. It sees a continued recovery in the eurozone, driven by consumer spending - with growth either 0.3% or 0.4% in the last three quarters. That is due to our accomodative monetary policy - and also due to cheaper oil. We concluded that our policies have been effective, in improving credit conditions and financial market conditions, and in the real economy. But the governing council concluded that more stimulus was needed. Draghi spells it out: Let me make this clear. We are doing more, because it works, not because it fails. So we decided to \u2018recalibrate\u2019 our policies, Draghi concludes (by extending QE by another six months) The re-investment of principle payments from bonds that mature is important, Draghi he insists. It means we are committed to maintain our liquidity position for longer than we\u2019ve been saying before, for \u201ca long long time\u201d Draghi is now urging eurozone governments to strive for \u201cmore growth-friendly\u201d fiscal policies. I\u2019ll post Draghi\u2019s full statement shortly. He\u2019s about to take questions. But the EC has cut its inflation forecasts even more -- inflation will be just 1.6% in 2017, well below the ECB\u2019s target of almost 2%. The ECB has slightly raised its growth forecasts: 2015 Growth now seen At 1.5%. up from 1.4% 2016 Growth Forecast Unchanged At 1.7% 2017 Growth now seen At 1.9%, up from 1.8% Open Europe analyst Raoul Ruparel says Draghi has failed to meet expectations, by not beefing up the amount of money the ECB is printing each month: Draghi sounds rather gloomy, warning that the risks to eurozone inflation are still on the downside (ie, there\u2019s more chance that it is too weak) The euro has spiked higher, hitting $1.08 against the US dollar. That\u2019s a gain of almost two cents. That shows that today\u2019s stimulus measures have not met market expectations (yet) Draghi has NOT said anything about increased the pace of quantitative easing. That suggests it will remain at \u20ac60bn per month - dashing hopes that the ECB would speed up its bond-buying purchase programme. Draghi also said the ECB has decided to reinvest the proceeds from QE as bonds mature. That\u2019s not a big shock - it just means the QE programme will not shrink as bonds bought by the ECB are repaid by the borrowers. Another important development: the ECB has extended the range of assets that are eligible for QE. It will now also buy regional and local government debt. The ECB has extended its QE programme! Draghi explains that the governing council decided that the current programme should run until until the end of March 2017, or beyond if necessary. That\u2019s an extra six months of QE. Draghi begins by saying the ECB governing council held a \u2018thorough\u2019 examination of the reasons why inflation is far below the ECB\u2019s target of nearly 2%. As a result, we took the following decisions: We decided to lower the deposit facility rate by 10 basis points to minus 0.3%, but left the other key rates unchanged (as we knew already). Mario Draghi has arrived at the press conference in Frankfurt for today\u2019s press conference. The ECB chief looks calm and relaxed, smiling at the press photographers as they jostle for a good picture. Mario Draghi\u2019s press conference will be streamed live, here (right-click to open in a new browser). I\u2019ll cover the key points, and instant reaction, in this blog. Enrique Diaz Alvarez, chief risk officer and currency expert at financial services group Ebury, predicts more fireworks from Mario Draghi in a few minutes: He says: \u201cToday\u2019s decision is expected to result in significant further easing by the ECB. Sustained low inflation in the Eurozone combined with a disappointing economic performance mean that Mario Draghi is likely to carry a comfortable majority of the Governing Council with him in his bid to pump further monetary stimulus. Now that things have calmed down, it appears that the markets are underwhelmed by these stimulus measures - or at least, what we\u2019ve heard so far. The euro has continued to strengthen since the ECB\u2019s announcement - which shows that investors had priced in a deeper interest rate cut. A lot of people were talking about a 20 basis point cut, to -0.4%, so today\u2019s 10 basis point cut obviously falls short. HOWEVER, we have not heard from ECB chief Mario Draghi yet. The press conference is in 15 minutes -- that\u2019s where any changes to QE will be explained. No pressure, Mario.... Financial pros on Twitter is offering the Pink \u2018Un its support at this difficult time: Up to a point anyway.... The ECB has taken fresh stimulus measures because it is worried that the eurozone is falling back into deflation, says David Katimbo-Mugwanya, fixed interest fund manager at EdenTree Investment Management. The desire to boost inflation in Europe is likely to have galvanised its decision to cut the deposit facility rate from -0.20%. Data this week showed that inflation was just 0.1% last month, way below the target of almost 2%. It\u2019s important to note that negative interest rates are only being imposed on eurozone banks, NOT consumers or businesses. That\u2019s because the European Central Bank has three separate interest rates, and it has only cut one of them - the deposit facility rate, which banks pay on deposits left at the ECB. By cutting the deposit rate from -0.2% to -0.3%, the ECB is effectively charging banks a larger penalty for not lending to the real economy. The \u2018main refinancing rate\u2019 -- the headline cost of borrowing, basically - is stuck at it record low of 0.05%. The third rate is the \u2018marginal lending facility\u2019 - charged on banks when they borrow from the ECB. That remains at 0.3%. Never wrong for long... The ECB has also dropped a big hint that it is expanding its quantitative easing programme. It says it will announce \u201cfurther policy measures\u201d at Mario Draghi\u2019s press conference, in 20 minutes. That strongly suggests the ECB will expand its bond-buying purchase scheme. Perhaps it will start buying more than \u20ac60bn of assets per month, or perhaps it will extend it beyond the current cut-off point of September 2016. Or perhaps both. BREAKING: The European Central Bank has announced new stimulus measures, in a fresh attempt to help the eurozone economy (and disproving that FT story that sent the euro surging) The ECB has cut its deposit rate, as expected, but only by 10 basis points to minus 0.3%. That means banks will be charged even more to store cash at the ECB. That\u2019s a slight disappointment, as some investors had expected a 20 basis point cut to -0.4%. Here\u2019s the shock FT story that sent the euro spiralling: This is curious... the euro has just spiked against the US dollar. This has been triggered by a report on the Financial Times that the ECB has left interest rates unchanged. It\u2019s online here. That\u2019s odd as the announcement isn\u2019t due for another minute.... The recent plunge in eurozone government bond yields into negative territory means that investors are effectively paying to hold short-term debt. (that\u2019s because if a bond yield is negative, the buyer has paid more than the face value of the bond). It\u2019s a remarkable thing, as analysts at Deutsche Bank point out: \u201cWe stand on the brink of another extraordinary central bank policy easing today, from the ECB of course, which has been increasingly priced into markets, meaning amongst other things that you have to pay heavily indebted governments even more for the right to lend to them at the front end of the curve.\u201d (via Reuters) The ECB has three goals today, says Stephen Macklow-Smith, Head of European Equities Strategy, J.P. Morgan Asset Management. And they are: maintain Euro weakness, keep interest rates lower for longer boost liquidity with a view to stimulating credit: He believes that the ECB\u2019s existing stimulus measures are working (although inflation is just 0.1%, the economy is growing and inflation expectations are rising). Cutting the deposit rate further would be a way of trying to force banks to lend more, but it is a blunt instrument. Extending the time period over which QE takes place is a possibility, as is expanding the scope of the purchases to include local government or corporate bonds. There will no doubt be volatility in both FX and rates while the policy announcements are made \u2013 but the key way to judge the effectiveness of ECB policy is to look at what happens to asset prices in the next week or month. The euro is continuing to fall; now down 0.65% today at $1.054 against the US dollar. (LOD = low of the day) The waiting is nearly over..... in 45 minutes, the European Central Bank will announce its decisions. Associated Press has a good preview, for anyone trying to get up to speed (I\u2019ve added links to relevant parts of this liveblog): Markets are waiting for the European Central Bank to announce Thursday that it will unleash another round of monetary stimulus for the eurozone\u2019s shaky economy. The ECB could cut the interest rate on deposits by commercial banks, effectively encouraging them to lend more rather than hoard it. The rate is already minus 0.2%, and analysts say it could be cut by another 0.10 percentage point or more. ECB President Mario Draghi could also announce it is extending its 60 billion euros ($64 billion) per month in bond purchases made with newly created money beyond September 2016, or increase the amount purchased every month, or both. The bond purchases are a way of increasing the amount of money in the economy, which in theory can make credit cheaper and raise inflation. Low inflation is the chief reason the ECB wants to take action. The current annual rate of 0.1 percent is well below the ECB\u2019s goal of just under 2 percent. Here\u2019s a great chart showing how the prospect of more eurozone QE has driven eurozone government borrowing costs to record lows (below zero in some cases). There are reports on Twitter of isolated clashes between some protesters and riot police in Athens, during the protest marches for today\u2019s general strike (as explained earlier). The Commission has also produced an infographic explaining why it\u2019s investigating McDonald\u2019s tax affairs.... Breaking news from Brussels.... the European Commission has just announced it has begun a formal probe into fast food giant McDonald\u2019s and its \u2018sweetheart\u2019 tax deal with Luxembourg. Commissioner Margrethe Vestager says the EC will investigate how McDonald\u2019s deal with Luxembourg\u2019s tax office meant it paid no corporate tax in Luxembourg, despite recording large profits. Vestager says: \u201cA tax ruling that agrees to McDonald\u2019s paying no tax on their European royalties either in Luxembourg or in the US has to be looked at very carefully under EU state aid rules. The purpose of Double Taxation treaties between countries is to avoid double taxation \u2013 not to justify double non-taxation.\u201d Here\u2019s the statement And here\u2019s our earlier story, explaining how some multinationals have secured controversial tax deals with the Lux authorities: Just two hours to go until the ECB publishes its decisions on interest rates. The yields, or interest rates, on shorter-dated eurozone government debt are hitting new lows this morning as investors buy them ahead of today\u2019s ECB decision. This has driven Italian two-year bonds deeper into negative yields - meaning investors are effectively taking a loss on them. However, they could still bank on selling them to the ECB - as it will buy anything yielding more than its deposit rate (currently -0.2%). German government debt has been in negative territory for a while -- and two-year debt is now yielding a staggering -0.438%. That suggests the market is pricing in a big cut to the deposit rate: Today\u2019s ECB meeting is the first act in a dramatic fortnight for the global economy. While Mario Draghi will probably ease monetary policy today, his US counterpart -- Fed chair Janet Yellen -- may well announce an interest rate rise on December 16th. The Economist Intelligence Unit\u2019s Robin Bew reckons it\u2019s a crucial time: And our own economics editor, Larry Elliott, warns that the divergence between the US and the eurozone could create a rocky time in the markets: Some analysts believe the sharply different strategies being pursued by the ECB and the Fed threaten a period of global financial turbulence. David Marsh and Ben Robinson of the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum thinktank said: \u201cThe great monetary polarisation between the US and Europe is under way. After a period of close alignment since the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008, US and European monetary policies are about to diverge in dramatic fashion. \u201cThe message from 70 years of monetary history is that, in the next few months, there is a roughly 50% chance of large-scale foreign exchange upheaval,\u201d they said. More here: Today\u2019s 24-hour general strike has also hit services in Athens and beyond. Transport links are closed, hospitals are operating with a skeleton staff, and the banks are shut too (a familiar feeling for Greeks this year...) Over in Greece, anti-austerity rallies are underway as unions protest against the pension reforms being implemented as part of the third Greek bailout. From Athens, Helena Smith reports: Protest rallies have begun as workers mark today\u2019s general strike. Unionists say they hope to get as many as 100,000 people onto the streets in a mass display of opposition against the austerity policies prime minister Alexis Tsipras\u2019 government is pursuing. This is the second general strike in the space of two weeks and is aimed, squarely, at sending the leftist-led administration a message: that \u201cenough is enough\u201d with austerity. \u201cWe are hoping to get a huge crowd onto the streets and to send this government and the troika [foreign lenders] a very clear message that ordinary working Greeks have had enough,\u201d Odysseus Trivalas, president of the civil servants union ADEDY told me. \u201cSome of us have lost 50 percent of our salaries and the recession is only set to get worst with this latest agreement [third bailout accord]. Austerity doesn\u2019t work, growth, development, economic recovery will never happen if such policies are pursued.\u201d Here\u2019s a photo of the communist union, PAME, marching in Athens this morning: Markit also reports that Britain\u2019s service sector grew at its fastest rate since July. That suggests the UK economy will expand by 0.6% in the last three months of the year it adds, up from 0.5% in the third quarter. The latest healthcheck of Europe\u2019s private sector paints a mixed pace. The Good News is that European companies are growing at a faster pace, with expansion hitting a four month high in November. Markit\u2019s composite PMI - which tracks activity across the manufacturing and services industry - has risen to 54.2, from 53.9. That means growth accelerated across the eurozone. The Less-good News, though, is that the prices charged by these companies fell for the second month running. That\u2019s great for consumers, but it also indicates that deflationary pressures are building - which might spur the ECB on to act. What happens if Draghi forgets to bring the rabbit? Ilya Spivak, currency strategist at DailyFX, says the euro would spike if the ECB fails to meet those market expectations: \u201cThe markets seem primed for a big-splash accommodative gesture, raising the bar on the ECB to deliver a dovish-enough result to mollify investors and increasing the threat of disappointment. If traders are left unimpressed, the Euro is likely to rise amid profit-taking on short positions while broad-based risk appetite deteriorates, weighing on sentiment-linked FX including the Australian and New Zealand Dollars.\u201d And while the ECB wouldn\u2019t ever admit it was weakening the euro, it wouldn\u2019t be pleased to see the currency strengthen (as this would be deflationary) Kit Juckes, currency strategist at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, believes Draghi could drive the euro lower today by announcing significant new stimulus measures: Everyone expects Mario Draghi to arrive with a hat and crucially, to produce a rabbit from it. We expect a 10bp cut in the ECB\u2019s Deposit Rate to -0.3% at today\u2019s meeting, more asset purchases (an increase of \u20ac10-20bn per month to \u20ac70-80bn, including a shift to widen the universe of bonds bought) and the reference to continuing purchases until September 2016 may (should) be dropped. A two-tier deposit rate to reduce the cost to banks is possible, as well. Will this be enough to move the Euro given the way expectations have been ramped up? Our best guess is that Mr Draghi will send a sufficiently dovish and committed message to the market that the Euro will remain under pressure, though two-way volatility can pick up. New French unemployment figures have highlighted that parts of the eurozone economy are still fragile. France\u2019s jobless rate jumped to 10.6% in the three months through September, up from 10.4% in the April-June quarter. That means France - the eurozone\u2019s second-largest economy - now has a higher unemployment rate than the region\u2019s average: It\u2019s a reminder that monetary policy can only do so much - a point Draghi makes at every opportunity, when he urges governments to make structural reforms post haste. European stock markets have risen in early trading, suggesting investors are confident that Mario Draghi will deliver something significant today: Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets says traders want to see three things from the European Central Bank today. Markets hope that President Super Mario Draghi delivers a hat-trick of stimulus measures to foster inflation and growth, both expanding and extending the current QE programme and taking deposit rates further into negative territory. Predictions are flooding in. Capital Economics are confident Draghi will deliver. They forecasting that QE will be bumped up to \u20ac80bn per month, from \u20ac60bn, and that the deposit rate is cut from -0.2% to -0.4%. French bank BNP Paribas expects a smaller boost to QE - just \u20ac10bn more per month, but with the ECB also extending the programme by 12 months. Economist Fred Ducrozet flags up that Draghi could change the \u2018yield threshold\u2019 of QE. Currently, the ECB can\u2019t buy some safe-haven government bonds that are trading significantly above their face value - changing the yield threshold would make them eligible for the QE programme. While Marc Ostwald of ADM Investor Services flags up that the ECB could make its quantitative easing programme open-ended: There is much speculation that the ECB may simply drop the reference to September 2016 in favour of \u2018as long as it takes to\u2019 confirm that CPI is headed back to target. This would hardly be a dramatic change, as this is already implied in the current formulation. Markets would probably welcome this as it can be interpreted as a form of \u201cQE infinity\u201d, though in truth it is a double edged sword, as the QE programme could be halted sooner than expected. Can Draghi handle the challenge of saving the eurozone from a deflationary slump? You betcha. Here\u2019s his favourite joke, via Business Insider: A man needs a heart transplant. Says the doctor: \u201cI can give you the heart of a five-year old boy.\u201d \u201cToo young.\u201d \u201cHow about that of a forty-year old investment banker?\u201d \u201cThey don\u2019t have a heart.\u201d \u201cA seventy-five year old central banker?\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll take it.\u201d \u201cBut why?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s never been used!\u201d The point being that big monetary policy decisions come from the head. If it\u2019s the right thing to do, just do it. Mind you, I bet Draghi\u2019s heart went bumpity-bump when protester Jo Witt disrupted April\u2019s press conference: This chart from ABN Amro shows that Draghi would have to announce quite a lot today to actually surprise the markets. More QE and deeper negative interest rates for commercial banks are already priced in. The ECB governing council have several weapons in their armory today: Extending quantitative easing for longer. The bond-buying programme is currently due to expire in September 2016, but the ECB could extend it by several months - or even indefinitely. Boost the QE firepower. The ECB is currently buying \u20ac60bn of assets each month, but could decide to mop up more. Cut the deposit rate deeper into negative territory. The deposit rate is already -0.2%, meaning banks are charged to leave money at the ECB. Draghi could lop off another 10 basis points, to -0.3%. New forward guidance. Draghi is unparalleled in his ability to \u201cjawbone\u201d the markets - his \u2018whatever it takes\u2019 speech of July 2012 which helped save the euro will go down in monetary policy history. So he could hint at future rate cuts, or other stimulus moves, in the future. My colleague Heather Stewart has analysed them in more detail here: You have to go back nearly a year to the last *really important* European Central Bank meeting. To January 22, in fact, when Draghi announced that the ECB would launch a QE programme to fend off the threat of deflation. Investors are already selling the euro, in anticipation of fresh stimulus measures today. The single currency has dropped by around 0.25% to $1.058, close to a seven-month low. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u2019s Mario Draghi\u2019s big moment, again. The European Central Bank\u2019s governing council is meeting in Frankfurt to set monetary policy, and we\u2019re all expecting a new dose of stimulus measures. With inflation at just 0.1%, unemployment still over 10% and bank lending disappointing, Draghi has plenty of excuses to ease monetary policy further. Economists expect the ECB to extend its quantitative easing programme; it could commit to buy more government bonds each month, or run the programme for longer. It is also expected to hit banks with sharper negative interest rates; that would encourage them to stop leaving money in the ECB\u2019s vaults. The interest rate decision comes at 12.45pm GMT (1.45pm Frankfurt time), followed by Mario Draghi\u2019s press conference 45 minutes later. There is a danger that the markets could be disappointed by the ECB\u2019s news, simply because investors are united in expecting new stimulus measures. More easing is \u2018priced in\u2019, in City jargon. But Draghi rarely lets us down, so he could well unleash some fireworks in his press conference. Also coming up today..... Unions in Greece have called a general strike, to protest against the government\u2019s pension cuts. New surveys of Europe\u2019s service sector are released this morning by Markit. The European commission is to open a state aid investigation into suspected sweetheart tax arrangements enjoyed by McDonald\u2019s in Luxembourg. And Janet Yellen, head of the Federal Reserve, is testifying to the Joint Economic Committee of the US congress, from 3pm GMT. I\u2019ll be covering all the events through the day...",

      "bodyText": "Secret trade talks in Geneva could outlaw subsidies for renewable energy, undermining climate discussions in Paris that aim to cut greenhouse gas emissions, anti-poverty campaigners have warned. The Geneva summit involving 22 countries including the US, Mexico, Australia and the 28 EU member states, aim to create a \u201clevel playing field\u201d, with the possible consequence that fracking companies could dispute subsidies for solar or wind power. Unions and anti-poverty campaigners said the implications for developing world economies that want to promote investment in renewable energy would prove disastrous. According to leaked documents, a draft chapter of the Trade in Services Agreement (TiSA) would, if adopted, force governments to accept \u201ctechnological neutrality\u201d. Disputes over subsidies to renewables would be resolved in a tribunal system outside national government control. \u201cThis chapter shall apply measures affecting trade in energy related services, irrespective of the energy source dealt with, technology used, whether the energy source is renewable or non-renewable, and whether the service is supplied onshore or offshore,\u201d says the draft obtained by WikiLeaks. EU officials have consistently argued that achieving climate targets will not be undermined by trade talks. The EU has set targets that include a cut of at least 40% in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 compared with 1990. Brussels must also reach a target of 27% energy consumption from renewables within the same timescale. A European commission said: \u201cThe EU is absolutely committed to increasing the renewables share and has demonstrated so over many years, by adopting policy measures to achieve that, complemented by many national policies authorised by or exempted from EU state aid rules. It is inconceivable that the EU would sign up to a trade agreement undermining that.\u201d However, critics of the talks said the proposals as drafted would leave \u201celected policymakers unable to encourage renewable energy over non-renewable, clean over dirty, or local over imported\u201d. Rosa Pavanelli, general secretary of the PSI international trade union, said: \u201cThis is the great climate change swindle. As ambitious targets are being discussed in Paris, in Geneva the means to achieve them are being negotiated away in the interests of the largest corporations. It is becoming clear why our governments try to hide these negotiations by conducting them in secret.\u201d The TiSa discussions are one of several attempts to break the deadlock in global trade deals since the World Trade Organisation\u2019s Doha round of talks became mired in disputes more than 10 years ago. Countries involved in TiSa also include Turkey, Austria, Canada, South Korea and Pakistan. Together they account for about 70% of global trade. The EU said: \u201cTiSa aims at opening up markets and improving rules in areas such as licensing, financial services, telecoms, e-commerce, maritime transport, and professionals moving abroad temporarily to provide services.\u201d Countries can submit proposals to the talks with the aim of finding a consensus among the states involved. This year Turkey tabled proposals that aimed to promote health tourism by forcing countries such as Britain, Germany and France to pay for health procedures in countries with cheaper services. The negotiations are being conducted in tandem with trade talks between major economic blocs covering goods and various regulations. The US recently signed the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) agreement with Japan and 10 other countries, and is in the closing stages of talks with the EU under the umbrella of the Transtlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP). While the EU has released some documents related to the TTIP discussions, the TiSa talks have been conducted behind closed doors. The trade page on the European commission\u2019s website says it is seeking a level playing field for domestic and foreign firms and between various energy types. \u201cThe EU will seek to end discrimination against foreign suppliers of environmental services. This means removing the existing barriers \u2013 not just abstaining from introducing new restrictions,\u201d it reads. The leaked text of the Annex on Environmental Services for the Trade in Services Agreement confirms many of these fears about the agreement\u2019s potential use to reverse regulatory safeguards related to the environment and to inhibit the promulgation of new environmental measures to protect people and the planet. A European commission spokesman said: \u201cJust as with TTIP, nothing in TiSA inhibits a continuation and reinforcement of efforts to increase the share of renewables in the energy mix. The draft TiSA text contains a clear provision applicable to the entire agreement and to all services that clearly recognises the right of TiSA Parties to regulate services within their territories to meet policy objectives.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Secret trade talks in Geneva could outlaw subsidies for renewable energy, undermining climate discussions in Paris that aim to cut greenhouse gas emissions, anti-poverty campaigners have warned.</p> <p>The Geneva summit involving 22 countries including the US, Mexico, Australia and the 28 EU member states, aim to create a \u201clevel playing field\u201d, with the possible consequence that fracking companies could dispute subsidies for solar or wind power.</p> <p>Unions and anti-poverty campaigners said the implications for developing world economies that want to promote investment in renewable energy would prove disastrous.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>According to <a href=\"https://wikileaks.org/tisa/\">leaked documents</a>, a draft chapter of the <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/trade/policy/in-focus/tisa/\">Trade in Services Agreement (TiSA)</a> would, if adopted, force governments to accept \u201ctechnological neutrality\u201d. Disputes over subsidies to renewables would be resolved in a tribunal system outside national government control.</p> <p>\u201cThis chapter shall apply measures affecting trade in energy related services, irrespective of the energy source dealt with, technology used, whether the energy source is renewable or non-renewable, and whether the service is supplied onshore or offshore,\u201d says the draft obtained by WikiLeaks.</p> <p>EU officials have consistently argued that achieving climate targets will not be undermined by trade talks. The EU has set targets that include a cut of at least 40% in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 compared with 1990. Brussels must also reach a target of 27% energy consumption from renewables within the same timescale.</p> <p>A European commission said: \u201cThe EU is absolutely committed to increasing the renewables share and has demonstrated so over many years, by adopting policy measures to achieve that, complemented by many national policies authorised by or exempted from EU state aid rules. It is inconceivable that the EU would sign up to a trade agreement undermining that.\u201d</p> <p>However, critics of the talks said the proposals as drafted would leave \u201celected policymakers unable to encourage renewable energy over non-renewable, clean over dirty, or local over imported\u201d.<br></p> <p>Rosa Pavanelli, general secretary of the PSI international trade union, said: \u201cThis is the great climate change swindle. As ambitious targets are being discussed in Paris, in Geneva the means to achieve them are being negotiated away in the interests of the largest corporations. It is becoming clear why our governments try to hide these negotiations by conducting them in secret.\u201d</p> <p>The TiSa discussions are one of several attempts to break the deadlock in global trade deals since the World Trade Organisation\u2019s Doha round of talks became mired in disputes more than 10 years ago.</p> <p>Countries involved in TiSa also include Turkey, Austria, Canada, South Korea and Pakistan. Together they account for about 70% of global trade. </p> <p>The EU said: \u201cTiSa aims at opening up markets and improving rules in areas such as licensing, financial services, telecoms, e-commerce, maritime transport, and professionals moving abroad temporarily to provide services.\u201d</p> <p>Countries can submit proposals to the talks with the aim of finding a consensus among the states involved. </p> <p>This year Turkey tabled proposals that aimed to promote health tourism by forcing countries such as Britain, Germany and France to pay for health procedures in countries with cheaper services. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The negotiations are being conducted in tandem with trade talks between major economic blocs covering goods and various regulations. The US recently signed the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) agreement with Japan and 10 other countries, and is in the closing stages of talks with the EU under the umbrella of the Transtlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP).</p> <p>While the EU has released some documents related to the TTIP discussions, the TiSa talks have been conducted behind closed doors. The trade page on the European commission\u2019s website says it is seeking a level playing field for domestic and foreign firms and between various energy types.</p> <p>\u201cThe EU will seek to end discrimination against foreign suppliers of environmental services. This means removing the existing barriers \u2013 not just abstaining from introducing new restrictions,\u201d it reads.</p> <p>The leaked text of the Annex on Environmental Services for the Trade in Services Agreement confirms many of these fears about the agreement\u2019s potential use to reverse regulatory safeguards related to the environment and to inhibit the promulgation of new environmental measures to protect people and the planet.</p> <p>A European commission spokesman said: \u201cJust as with TTIP, nothing in TiSA inhibits a continuation and reinforcement of efforts to increase the share of renewables in the energy mix. The draft TiSA text contains a clear provision applicable to the entire agreement and to all services that clearly recognises the right of TiSA Parties to regulate services within their territories to meet policy objectives.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "The currency markets and share prices spoke volumes. Financial markets waited for Mario Draghi to fire his big bazooka and when it became clear he was holding a peashooter instead, they bought the single currency and dumped stocks. The euro rose against the dollar and screens showing equity prices went red. The reason for the reaction was simple: markets had expected a lot more. They had been looking for the European Central Bank to announce it was cutting its deposit rate from -0.2% to -0.4%, making it more expensive for commercial banks to hold deposits with the central bank. They got a cut to -0.3%. More importantly, markets expected Draghi to announce that the ECB was increasing the pace of asset purchases under its quantitative easing programme, from \u20ac60bn (\u00a343bn) a month to \u20ac75bn or \u20ac80bn a month. It was left unchanged. All Draghi had to offer was an extension of the QE programme for at least six months into the spring of 2017, and a decision to expand the list of eligible bonds to local and municipal governments. As Jonathan Loynes of Capital Economics noted, the ECB failed to live up to its own hype. The euro has been falling for weeks because of broad hints that decisive action would be taken to raise the eurozone\u2019s inflation rate from its worryingly low level of 0.1%. This was not it. There are two possible reasons why the ECB might have come to its decision. The first is that it believes the prospects for the eurozone are brighter than they were a few months ago, in part because of easing global financial tensions and in part due to the impact QE is having domestically. That looks unlikely given that the ECB has not materially changed its growth forecasts for the next two years and has revised down its inflation forecasts slightly. The second \u2013 and far more likely \u2013 explanation is that Draghi wanted to do more but had been prevented from doing so by divisions on the ECB council. It has been clear for some time that the Bundesbank president, Jens Weidmann, opposes an expansion of QE, and his was probably not the only dissenting voice. The reaction of the financial markets was entirely rational. QE works through a number of channels: it lowers bond yields; it drives currencies lower and it pushes up asset prices. The euro had been pushed lower and stock markets had been driven higher in expectation that the ECB would do something meaningful. When it didn\u2019t, the markets unwound the positions built in advance of Draghi\u2019s announcement. The smart money will be on the euro\u2019s rise being temporary. After all, it is widely expected that the Federal Reserve will raise US interest rates for the first time since 2006 when it meets this month. But talk of a further big plunge in the euro look overdone. An increase in US borrowing costs is already in the price. And Draghi has shown all too vividly that the hints of central bankers \u2013 even the biggest hints \u2013 should be treated with some caution.",

      "bodyText": "Carluccio\u2019s opened in Beverley last month. An unremarkable event, for sure, and certainly of little interest to the compilers of Britain\u2019s national income figures. Yet the move by the Italian restaurant chain into the wealthy East Riding town is part of a trend for eating out that has generated much of the UK\u2019s extra services industry growth in the past three years. And it is this desire among households to spend increasing amounts of their disposable incomes in restaurant chains and wine bars that has translated into higher GDP growth. Despite the continuing closure of pubs across Britain, the eating and drinking out market has been booming, with a net 1,770 new restaurants opening in the past 12 months, according to the latest data. Last month, however, the survey evidence from Markit\u2019s purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) for the leisure and restaurant sector suggests the growing appetite for eating out is starting to wane. Markit\u2019s chief economist, Chris Williamson, said slowdown in growth might be caused by nervousness about a possible rise in interest rates next year. Or it might just be a pre-Christmas lull. We will need to wait and see. Things were going better in financial services, IT and computing, and transportation, he said. All three have shown strong growth in the past two years and that continues unabated. While the extra investment in IT services can only benefit productivity, the rise in transportation appears to be based on bringing extra imports into the country, with vans chasing round delivering them \u2013 many purchased on Black Friday. The balance of payments is in a parlous state, with the mismatch between imports and exports at a record, and a deficit far worse than other OECD countries. The UK needs an economy based on increases in exports, not one that relies on the income from selling and transporting ever larger amounts of imported goods. And it remains a fact that the financial services sector needs a period of recovery after the battering it took seven years ago.

      "bodyText": "The owner of Stansted has called on the government to raise the flight cap at the Essex airport, warning that otherwise passenger demand in the south-east will not be met until the completion of a new London runway, potentially a decade away. Almost 5 million more passengers used Stansted this year than in 2013, when Manchester Airports Group (MAG) bought the hub from Heathrow. At that rate of growth, the third-biggest London airport is on course to hit its permitted maximum of 35 million a year in six to seven years, although the airport says it could handle another 7 million with its current infrastructure. Charlie Cornish, chief executive of MAG, said the increase in numbers showed Stansted had \u201cmore potential and will grow quicker than the forecasts in the airports commission report. If we extrapolate, in five years we\u2019ll be pretty close to the planning cap.\u201d He said the airport\u2019s 11% annual growth was far outstripping Gatwick\u2019s and showed the government needed to take the commission\u2019s recommendations seriously, including improving rail links to Stansted and lifting the cap, proposed in its interim report. The government is expected to announce this month its response to the recommendation to expand Heathrow, at a cost of \u00a318bn, potentially by 2026. Cornish said: \u201cWhen they consider the Heathrow question, we do want the government to respond to the short-term measures \u2013 because there\u2019s going to be no new runway capacity in London for the next 15 years whatever happens.\u201d The MAG boss said the group would engage with local communities next year to get the planning cap lifted. \u201cIt\u2019s really for us to demonstrate the benefits in terms of economic development we bring to the region. Engine technology has changed \u2013 there\u2019s probably a lot less noise around Stansted now than there was 10 years ago. But it would be good for the government to indicate its support,\u201d he said. Sir Howard Davies\u2019 commission said Stansted was a \u201cplausible candidate\u201d for the next runway after Heathrow, and Cornish said MAG would soon need to start seriously considering expansion plans, with a completed second runway likely to take two decades to achieve. \u201cWe have to give serious consideration to Stansted\u2019s catchment and the potential in the 10-20 years after that. We are growing rapidly. London is growing east, and the environmental impact at Stansted is significantly less than at Heathrow or Gatwick. In three to five years we have to start seriously considering a second runway,\u201d he said. The group reported a 16.5% year-on-year leap in operating profits for the first six months of 2015-16, driven mainly by Manchester airport and then Stansted. Record passenger numbers at Manchester pushed up profits to \u00a3137m. MAG announced a dividend of \u00a339m, representing a windfall of \u00a325m for the councils around Manchester which collectively own two-thirds of the group.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The European commission has opened a formal state aid investigation into what it believes to be two unlawful sweetheart tax deals that Luxembourg granted to McDonald\u2019s six years ago. It is examining the tax rulings the grand duchy gave the fast food group in 2009, the year the business shifted its European headquarters out of London. The fast food group\u2019s Luxembourg company, McDonald\u2019s Europe Franchising Sarl, has paid no corporate tax in the grand duchy since 2009, the commission said. This was despite receiving hundreds of millions of euros in royalty payments from across Europe and Russia for the right to use the brand and associated service. For 2013 alone its profits were more than \u20ac250m (\u00a3176m). Under the terms of its Luxembourg tax ruling, McDonald\u2019s Europe Franchising has not been required to pay tax locally because the grand duchy regards almost all of its profits to have been generated through the Luxembourg company\u2019s US branch. However, US tax rules offer a different view. Under American rules, the Luxembourg company\u2019s profits should be taxed in Luxembourg, where the company is registered, not at its US branch office. As a result, the profits of McDonald\u2019s Europe Franchising go untaxed by both Luxembourg and the US. Margrethe Vestager, Europe\u2019s competition commissioner, stated: \u201cA tax ruling that agrees to McDonald\u2019s paying no tax on their European royalties either in Luxembourg or in the US has to be looked at very carefully under EU state aid rules. The purpose of double taxation treaties between countries is to avoid double taxation \u2013 not to justify double non-taxation.\u201d Untaxed, or \u201cstateless\u201d, profits are considered the holy grail for international tax planners who specialise in creating complex cross-border corporate structures for multinationals. The structures are designed to exploit differences between different countries\u2019 tax codes such that earnings can escape without being taxed. Responding to the commission\u2019s investigation, McDonald\u2019s said: \u201cWe are subject to the same tax laws as other companies and are confident that the inquiry will be resolved favourably.\u201d It added: \u201cMcDonald\u2019s complies with all tax laws and rules in Europe and pays a significant amount of corporate income tax. In fact, from 2010-2014, the McDonald\u2019s Companies paid more than $2.1bn just in corporate taxes in the European Union, with an average tax rate of almost 27%.\u201d The Luxembourg tax affairs of Europe\u2019s largest fast food chain have already been subject to considerable scrutiny, attracting a French tax office investigation in 2013 and a critical report this year from a coalition of union groups. Officials in Brussels had been reviewing the report and gathering further preliminary evidence since March. This is the third Luxembourg tax ruling over which the commission has raised state aid concerns. Officials are continuing to investigate a tax deal granted to Amazon in 2003, and determined in October that a tax ruling provided by the grand duchy to Chrysler Fiat was so generous as to amount to unlawful state aid. The tax deals under scrutiny \u2013 sometimes known as \u201ccomfort letters\u201d \u2013 provide businesses that have complex or controversial tax affairs with certainty as to how they will be taxed in a country. These private assurances have attracted criticism from politicians and campaigners who argue that some countries are secretly offering multinationals bespoke generous tax deals in exchange for inward investment and jobs. The Luxembourg finance ministry said: \u201c[We] consider that no special tax treatment nor selective advantage have been granted to McDonald\u2019s. Luxembourg will fully cooperate with the commission in the investigation.\u201d It is already appealing the state aid decision in the Chrysler Fiat case and denies allegations of state aid in relation to Amazon and McDonald\u2019s. Should the commission\u2019s investigation into Luxembourg\u2019s tax deal with McDonald\u2019s lead to a finding of unlawful state aid, the restaurant group could be forced to pay huge sums to the grand duchy after its historic tax bills are recalculated. Some critics have questioned whether such a remedy would reflect a fairer tax treatment. Campaigners want to see taxes being paid where economic activity occurs: in the case of McDonald\u2019s, there is little evidence that Luxembourg represents a hub of economic activity for the restaurant group.",

      "bodyText": "Eurozone markets have plunged after the European Central Bank president dashed investors\u2019 hopes of aggressive new measures to boost the flagging economy. Mario Draghi had sent strong signals in recent weeks that he and his colleagues on the ECB\u2019s governing council were prepared to \u201cdo what we must to raise inflation as quickly as possible\u201d, and news that inflation remained at just 0.1% in November had intensified expectations of decisive action. In the event, Draghi announced a modest reduction in the deposit rate paid on reserves held at the central bank \u2013 which is already negative but falls further from -0.2% to -0.3% \u2013 and a six-month extension of the end-date for the ECB\u2019s \u20ac60bn-a-month quantitative easing (QE) programme. At his press conference, Draghi said the measures would \u201creinforce the momentum of the euro area recovery, and strengthen its resilience against recent global economic shocks\u201d. But markets, which have become reliant on the flood of cheap cash pouring from the world\u2019s central banks, deemed the announcement to be a disappointment. As Draghi spoke at a press conference in Frankfurt after the decision, the euro surged on foreign exchanges \u2013 the reverse of the impact policymakers hope for from QE. The euro gained two and a half cents against the dollar, jumping from below $1.06 to above $1.08: the largest one day move since March. Shares fell sharply, with the French Cac and German Dax indices closing down more than 3.5%. In London, the FTSE 100 lost 2.2% of its value. Jonathan Loynes, chief European economist at consultancy Capital Economics, said: \u201cThe ECB has comprehensively failed to live up to its own hype and markets and forecasters will take future communications from Mr Draghi and colleagues with a corresponding bucket of salt.\u201d Analysts suggested the more sceptical members of the ECB\u2019s governing council, such as the Bundesbank president, Jens Weidmann, may have blocked more aggressive action. Draghi acknowledged the decisions at the council meeting had not been unanimous, but had been passed by a \u201cvery large majority\u201d. \u201cWe are doing more because it works: we want to consolidate something that\u2019s been a success. This cut in the deposit rate, we think it\u2019s adequate,\u201d he said. The lower deposit rate means banks, which in effect already have to pay the ECB for holding their cash, will have to pay more, in an attempt to keep money flowing around the eurozone economy, instead of parked at the central bank. The euro spiked on foreign exchanges in the moments before the announcement, when the Financial Times accidentally published a story wrongly suggesting the ECB had left interest rates unchanged. The FT subsequently removed the story from its website and issued an apology, saying: \u201cPlease ignore earlier tweet headlined \u2018ECB leaves rates unchanged in shock decision\u2019. This was published in error.\u201d The ECB said it would leave its other interest rates unchanged, including the key refinancing rate, which ripples out to borrowers across the economy. This rate has already been slashed to just 0.05%. Draghi said cheaper oil was underpinning the economy by boosting consumer demand, but he pointed to the risks to growth from global shocks such as the Chinese downturn. \u201cThe risks to the euro area growth outlook relate in particular to the heightened uncertainties regarding developments in the global economy as well as to broader geopolitical risks,\u201d he said. As he spoke, the Greek authorities were wrestling with a new general strike in the recession-scarred country. The Syriza government in Athens has faced repeated protests over the austerity measures it has been forced to take as a result of the bailout deal struck with its eurozone creditors. Some analysts said the markets\u2019 disappointment with the ECB\u2019s actions on Thursday might eventually fade. David Owen, of consultancy Jefferies, said the announcement that QE would continue until at least March 2017 suggested Draghi and his colleagues were determined to keep boosting the eurozone economy, even if the US Federal Reserve pushed up interest rates this month as expected. He also stressed other elements of the announcement, including news that the ECB would include regional and local government debts in its bond-buying programme and would reinvest the repayments it received on the bonds it already owns to keep policy stimulative. \u201cRather than \u2018shocking and awing\u2019 the markets, the ECB signalled it is prepared to play the long game,\u201d Owen said.",

      "bodyText": "The International Monetary Fund has issued a warning before a meeting of the Opec oil cartel that permanently low fossil fuels are choking off investment in renewable sources of energy and hindering the fight against climate change. Oil prices rallied slightly amid reports \u2013 later denied \u2013 that Saudi Arabia plans to announce a 1m barrels a day production cut at the talks in Vienna on Friday. The price of Brent crude was up more than 2% at just under $43.50 in early trading on Thursday. But an assesment of the energy market from the IMF, co-authored by its chief economist Maurice Obstfeld, said a global carbon price was needed to reflect the true cost of burning fossil fuels and to provide resources for investment in green technologies. In an attempt to prompt action at the Paris climate change conference, Obstfeld and Rabah Arezki said: \u201cFossil fuel prices are likely to stay low for long. Nothwithstanding important recent progress in developing renewable fuel sources, low fossil fuel prices could discourage further innovation in, and adoption of, cleaner energy technologies. The result would be higher emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.\u201d Oil prices have fallen by more than 60% in the past 18 months, while gas prices have halved and coal prices have continued to decline. The IMF economists said in the past low oil prices were self-correcting, because they resulted in a lack of investment in new production capacity which led to supply failing to meet demand. But it said there were a number of reasons why oil prices were unlikely to bounce back: new shale production; Opec\u2019s reluctance to cut production; the projected increase in Iranian exports; and the easing of global demand. \u201cPolicymakers should not allow low energy prices to derail the clean energy transition. Action to restore appropriate price incentives, notably through corrective carbon pricing, is urgently needed to lower the risk of irreversible and potentially devastating effects of climate change.\u201d Fossil fuels continue to dominate global energy consumption. Oil accounted for 33% of the total in 2014, gas 30% and natural gas 24%. Nuclear accounted for 4% of primary energy consumption, and renewables 9%. The IMF analysis chimed with studies showing that renewable energy will have to displace fossil fuels to a much greater extent in the future to avoid unacceptable climate risks. \u201cUnfortunately, the current low prices for oil, gas, and coal may provide scant incentive for research to find even cheaper substitutes for those fuels.\u201d Expressing the hope that the Paris meeting would \u201copen the door\u201d to a future international agreement on carbon prices, the IMF has said such a deal would generate substantial fiscal revenues by eliminating fossil fuels subsidies and by charging for the damage caused by emissions. \u201cA tax on upstream carbon sources is one easy way to put a price on carbon emissions, although some countries may wish to use other methods, such as emissions trading schemes,\u201d it said.

Chris Williamson, chief economist at the data provider Markit, which compiles the survey, said the reading suggested the UK \u201ccontinues to enjoy the \u2018Goldilocks\u2019 scenario of solid economic growth and low inflation.\u201d City analysts said the strong survey reading suggested that a slowdown in GDP growth, to 0.5% in the third quarter from 0.7% in the spring, may be reversed in the final three months of 2015. \u201cThe improvement in the report on services in November reinforces our view that the economy will reverse its temporary slowdown seen in Q3, offsetting the slowing in the manufacturing and construction sectors,\u201d said Ruth Miller, UK economist at Capital Economics. Stepping back from volatility, both the official index of services and the PMI have shown a gradual weakening in services growth over the past year. Williamson said that combining survey results from different sectors of the economy suggested GDP growth would bounce back, to 0.6% in the fourth quarter. Evidence that the slowdown in the third quarter was temporary is likely to strengthen the argument of anti-inflation hawks on the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy, who believe interest rates should rise soon. Mark Carney, the Bank\u2019s governor, has suggested the decision about when to tighten policy is likely to come into \u201csharper relief\u201d around the turn of the year. Howard Archer, of IHS Global Insight, said: \u201cThe improved November services survey reinforces our belief that the Bank of England is more likely than not to raise interest rates from 0.50% to 0.75% sometime in the first half of 2016, most probably in May.\u201d However, the PMI survey also pointed to weak pricing power among services firms, which suggests there is little inflationary pressure building up.",

Corporate lobbying groups have attacked many of the OECD\u2019s reform plans. This week the National Association of Manufacturers in the US urged the Senate finance committee to help block reforms it said would force US companies to disclose \u201cextremely sensitive information unrelated to actual taxpayer activities\u201d to foreign tax offices. The libertarian Cato Institute, funded by the billionaire industrialist Koch brothers, has also campaigned hard against OECD reforms describing them as a \u201cglobal tax cartel\u201d plot.

He learned of the board\u2019s decision to fire him in a phone call from the British bank\u2019s chairman John McFarlane. Asked if he had been shocked to be told by phone, he told the BBC: \u201cWell, I\u2019m a human being, so I have to say that it was surprising to me, but I completely respect the authority of the board in choosing the CEO.\u201d He added: \u201cAnd I\u2019m realistic. I\u2019ve been in corporate life for over 30 years. These things happen. The bank was performing very well.\u201d McFarlane said at the time that Jenkins\u2019 strategy was not at issue, but the speed of change was. Barclays shares rose 3% on the news of his departure. Jenkins said on Thursday he felt he needed five to 10 years to change the lender\u2019s culture. He said: \u201cIt is a source of regret to me that I wasn\u2019t able to complete the work.\u201d He added that he was proud of his three years at the helm, arguing that he left the bank in much better shape than it was in when he took the job in August 2012 in the wake of the Libor scandal. Meanwhile, Barclays has announced the sale of its Italian retail banking network to Mediobanca Group\u2019s retail arm at a loss of \u00a3200m.

Jes Staley, Barclays\u2019 new chief executive, said: \u201cThis transaction is further evidence of the reshaping of Barclays Group to focus on our core businesses.\u201d Barclays has sold its retail banking operations in Spain and Portugal and also wants to sell some assets in France.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A critical few weeks for the global economy will begin on Thursday when the European Central Bank (ECB) decides whether to take fresh steps to boost growth and stimulate inflation in the 19-country eurozone. Financial markets are convinced the ECB\u2019s president, Mario Draghi, will announce cuts in interest rates and a stepping up of the bond-buying programme known as quantitative easing (QE) after its latest policy meeting in Frankfurt. The likely move comes as Janet Yellen, chair of the Federal Reserve, dropped broad hints that the US central bank would raise US borrowing costs later this month for the first time since the global financial and economic crisis began more than eight years ago. Some analysts believe the sharply different strategies being pursued by the ECB and the Fed threaten a period of global financial turbulence. David Marsh and Ben Robinson of the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum thinktank said: \u201cThe great monetary polarisation between the US and Europe is under way. After a period of close alignment since the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008, US and European monetary policies are about to diverge in dramatic fashion. \u201cThe message from 70 years of monetary history is that, in the next few months, there is a roughly 50% chance of large-scale foreign exchange upheaval,\u201d they said. The eurozone economy has been growing modestly in 2015 and unemployment has been coming down slowly, but the ECB is concerned about the low level of inflation. Latest data showed consumer prices rising by just 0.1% in the year to November, unchanged on October. Analysts say that Draghi has three options open to him: to cut interest rates deeper into negative territory, to expand the QE programme from its current \u20ac60bn (\u00a342bn) a month, and to extend the programme beyond next September, when it is due to end. Jack Allen, European economist at Capital Economics, said: \u201cAhead of the ECB\u2019s policy announcement, the question is how, rather than if, the governing council will loosen monetary policy. We expect an increase in the monthly pace of asset purchases from \u20ac60bn to \u20ac80bn, as well as a strong signal that the programme will last beyond next September.\u201d Allen said he expected the ECB to cut its deposit rate from -0.2% to -0.4%.

Here are some of the options it might take to fulfil that promise on Thursday: Extending quantitative easing for longer The ECB\u2019s \u20ac1.1tn (\u00a3780bn) quantitative easing (QE) scheme was announced in January and involved using electronically created money to buy bonds. The ECB hoped financial institutions would invest the proceeds elsewhere in the eurozone economy and that the programme would drive down the value of the euro, making exports more competitive. The current phase of QE is due to finish in September, but Draghi has always said it would continue, \u201cuntil we see a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation\u201d. With inflation at just 0.1% in November, he could shift that deadline into 2017. Increasing the scale of monthly bond purchases Draghi and his colleagues could increase the value of the government bonds they buy each month, from the current \u20ac60bn a month level. However, some analysts argue there are risks that the supply of bonds is not big enough to accommodate a big expansion. Draghi could also widen the scope of the bond purchases to include riskier asset classes. Cutting the deposit rate The ECB already pays a negative deposit rate, of -0.2%, on reserves held at the central bank. In other words, banks must in effect pay the ECB for looking after their money: a measure aimed at keeping money flowing around the economy. The ECB could cut this rate further, which some analysts think could be as low as -0.4%. There are also suggestions that it could introduce a two-tier deposit rate, similar to that adopted by the Danish and Swiss central banks, to penalise banks more heavily, the more of their reserves they keep out of circulation at the ECB. Forward guidance Draghi is renowned for using carefully honed statements to direct the markets, most memorably when he promised at the height of the eurozone crisis in July 2012 that he would do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to safeguard the single currency. He could use a similar dose of verbal reassurance on Thursday to convince investors the ECB will not let the economy slide into deflation. Nothing at all Few analysts are betting on it, but it\u2019s not impossible that the ECB could decide to sit on its hands. Draghi may be a man of action, but he has previously faced strong resistance within the governing council, in particular from the German Bundesbank governor, Jens Weidmann.",

      "bodyText": "The latest Australian GDP figures were cause for celebration. An astonishing 0.9% growth in the September quarter is well above the long-term average. But the good news also shows how erratic economic growth in this new economy can be, when it is driven by exports. Strong but volatile growth As with recent unemployment rate figures, right now you need to take care not to overreact to seasonally adjusted GDP growth figures. For no real good reason they are the ones that get all the attention, but in the past year, they have been all over the shop. A poor 0.4% growth in the December quarter, a great 0.9% in March, a lousy 0.3% in June and now another great 0.9% in the September quarter: It\u2019s a good time to take a chill pill and cruise along with the more relaxed trend figures. In trend terms the economy grew by 0.6% in the September quarter \u2013 the same as in both the June and March quarters. And it adds up to a rather unimpressive annual growth rate of 2.3%: Both per capita and nominal growth are improving slightly, but given the May budget forecast nominal GDP growth in 2015-16 of 3.25%, the current rate of 1.9% will need to get a chug along if Scott Morrison wants to see some improved revenue figures. I suspect the mid-year fiscal and economic outlook, to be released in two to three weeks\u2019 time, will show a revised-down estimate. Praise be our exports Take away our exports and, in effect, Australia\u2019s economy did not grow at all. Exports contributed 1.0 points to quarterly GDP growth in the September quarter \u2013 thus accounting for all and a bit more of the 0.9% growth. But this is where things get wild and bumpy. In the June quarter exports actually fell 3.3%, the worst quarterly fall in four years. In the September quarter, in seasonally adjusted terms, exports rose 4.6% \u2013 the biggest quarterly rise since September 2000: The annual growth chart is a tad clearer and less resembling the heart monitor of a particularly stressed hospital patient. What it shows is that despite the joyous boom of exports this quarter, annual exports have slightly come off their peak: We see this bumpy nature of exports when we look at its contribution to quarterly growth. Net exports actually contributed a massive 1.5% points to quarterly growth, because not only did exports rise, imports fell by 2.4%: So while the story was good this quarter, it\u2019s pretty clear that putting all your hopes on exports to lead us to consistent strong growth is not a winning formula. Give some praise to households as well OK, so exports led the way, but what else helped? Well, mostly household spending, government spending and private dwelling construction: Household spending has been a big booster in the past 12 months \u2013 running a close second to net exports in driving economic growth. For two years now, household consumption has been growing annually by at least 2.5% in real terms. And what have we been spending our money on? Well, mostly insurance and financial services, rent and health. Yeah \u2013 not exactly party time. Those three combined accounted for half of the growth in household consumption in the past year: At least when you pay your rent, your latest private health bill, and are waiting to see the GP, you can content yourself that you are helping Australia\u2019s economy grow. While it doesn\u2019t contribute as much to GDP growth, we have become rather enamoured of buying a car in the past year. Vehicle purchases grew by 8.1% in trend terms \u2013 the biggest annual increase for a couple years. One thing we\u2019re not getting enamoured with is cigarettes and alcohol. Consumption of cigarettes was down 11.4% in the past year and alcohol consumption down 2.3%: So while recreation and culture spending grew by 2.2%, clearly we\u2019re indulging in more family-friendly recreation. While we\u2019re at it, thank houses The housing boom continues \u2013 at least on the east coast. Total dwelling investment grew by 1.2% in trend terms in the September quarter and 8.8% in the past year: While there has been a bit of a plateau, it remains strong, and contributed 0.4 percentage points to annual GDP growth. But alas, non-dwelling construction continues to fall due to the end of the mining investment boom. In trend terms such engineering construction fell 2.5% in the September quarter and 10.5% in the past year. One silver lining is that the pace of the decline appears to be slowing, but the decline continues. And given the fall in non-dwelling construction subtracted 1.0 percentage points from annual GDP growth, in no way is housing construction filling the gap: Where\u2019s the demand? So housing construction was up, but not enough to account for the collapse of engineering construction. With overall private sector investment falling, it may be surprising to find that public investment also continues to fall: In seasonally adjusted terms, public capital expenditure fell 9.2% in the September quarter. Treasurer Scott Morrison was asked about this, and he fobbed it off, somewhat rightly noting that quarterly growth figures are \u201cvolatile measures\u201d. But there is no getting around the fact that public investment has been falling since the middle of 2013. Combined with the woeful private investment figures, it means overall demand in the economy is at recession-type levels: But the falls are very much concentrated in WA and Queensland. In New South Wales and Victoria, things are looking rather better: And what drives the demand in NSW? As with elsewhere, household consumption is the big driver, and so too is (unsurprisingly) dwelling construction. But NSW has also seen growth due to investment by the state government. Who would have thought public investment could drive economic growth?",

Net exports actually contributed a massive 1.5% points to quarterly growth, because not only did exports rise, imports fell by 2.4%:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Contributions of net exports to quarterly GDP growth.\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/eJLWc/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>So while the story was good this quarter, it\u2019s pretty clear that putting all your hopes on exports to lead us to consistent strong growth is not a winning formula.</p> <h2><strong>Give some praise to households as well</strong></h2> <p>OK, so exports led the way, but what else helped? Well, mostly household spending, government spending and private dwelling construction: </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Contributions to GDP growth.\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/CcohB/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Household spending has been a big booster in the past 12 months \u2013 running a close second to net exports in driving economic growth. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Contribution of households consumption to annual GDP growth.\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/kQ8BP/2/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>For two years now, household consumption has been growing annually by at least 2.5% in real terms. </p> <p>And what have we been spending our money on? Well, mostly insurance and financial services, rent and health. Yeah \u2013 not exactly party time. Those three combined accounted for half of the growth in household consumption in the past year: </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Household consumption (trend).\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/bNDbB/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>At least when you pay your rent, your latest private health bill, and are waiting to see the GP, you can content yourself that you are helping Australia\u2019s economy grow. </p> <p>While it doesn\u2019t contribute as much to GDP growth, we have become rather enamoured of buying a car in the past year. Vehicle purchases grew by 8.1% in trend terms \u2013 the biggest annual increase for a couple years.</p> <p>One thing we\u2019re not getting enamoured with is cigarettes and alcohol. Consumption of cigarettes was down 11.4% in the past year and alcohol consumption down 2.3%:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Consumption of cigarettes, tobacco and alcohol - annual growth.\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/BwjgI/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>So while recreation and culture spending grew by 2.2%, clearly we\u2019re indulging in more family-friendly recreation.</p> <h2><strong>While we\u2019re at it, thank houses</strong></h2> <p>The housing boom continues \u2013 at least on the east coast. Total dwelling investment grew by 1.2% in trend terms in the September quarter and 8.8% in the past year:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Growth of private investment in dwellings (trend).\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Joktn/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>While there has been a bit of a plateau, it remains strong, and contributed 0.4 percentage points to annual GDP growth.</p> <p>But alas, non-dwelling construction continues to fall due to the end of the mining investment boom. In trend terms such engineering construction fell 2.5% in the September quarter and 10.5% in the past year. </p> <p>One silver lining is that the pace of the decline appears to be slowing, but the decline continues. </p> <p>And given the fall in non-dwelling construction subtracted 1.0 percentage points from annual GDP growth, in no way is housing construction filling the gap:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Contribution of dwelling and non-dwelling investment to annual GDP growth.\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/lSALM/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <h2><strong>Where\u2019s the demand?</strong></h2> <p>So housing construction was up, but not enough to account for the collapse of engineering construction. With overall private sector investment falling, it may be surprising to find that public investment also continues to fall:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Annual growth of gross fixed capital formation.\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/D9lXO/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>In seasonally adjusted terms, public capital expenditure fell 9.2% in the September quarter. Treasurer Scott Morrison was asked about this, and he fobbed it off, somewhat rightly noting that quarterly growth figures are \u201cvolatile measures\u201d. But there is no getting around the fact that public investment has been falling since the middle of 2013. </p> <p>Combined with the woeful private investment figures, it means overall demand in the economy is at recession-type levels:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Growth of final domestic demand.\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/WVVlT/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>But the falls are very much concentrated in WA and Queensland. In New South Wales and Victoria, things are looking rather better:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Annual growth of state final demand (trend).\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/LcM7n/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>And what drives the demand in NSW?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"NSW state final demand.\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/JjrOP/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>As with elsewhere, household consumption is the big driver, and so too is (unsurprisingly) dwelling construction. But NSW has also seen growth due to investment by the state government.</p> <p>Who would have thought public investment could drive economic growth?</p>",
