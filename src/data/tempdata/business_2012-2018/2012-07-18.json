      "bodyText": "Embattled security group G4S has come under further pressure after MPs questioned the \"astonishing\" rise in the price of the contract to provide Olympic venue guards and insisted the recent humiliating debacle over numbers was predictable. In a report published on Thursday on G4S's embarrassing inability to fulfil its contract, the Commons public accounts committee said there was \"no credible explanation\" for the sharp increase in fees that prompted one MP to say \"the first winner of an Olympic gold is G4S.\" As London 2012 organisers, the army and Home Office officials scramble to fill security rotas despite the deployment of 3,500 additional troops, Metropolitan police officers were on Wednesday forced to guard the Olympic venue at Lord's cricket ground because G4S guards failed to show up. About 20 police officers were bussed in at 6am on Wednesday to the north London venue where the archery competition will take place, the Guardian was told, and stayed there for 10 hours before being replaced by others. Officers were told that G4S security guards had to be replaced at short notice and that some had been found asleep, which G4S denied. Some officers were told they have to return the following day. Nine out of 12 police forces have been drafted in to help Games security. They include Strathclyde, West Midlands, Thames Valley, Greater Manchester and Dorset. A spokesman for G4S said that police officers were first invited in to Lord's on Monday because of \"staffing issues\". The committee said it would be undertaking its own inquiry after the Olympics, and that the Home Office needed to get a grip urgently if the Games were to pass off without further chaos. The home affairs select committee has also announced an inquiry to take place in September, calling all the main players to give evidence. The Ministry of Defence is providing 3,500 extra troops to cover shortfalls from G4S, and the military believes it may have to provide between 500 and 2,000 more personnel in the coming days. G4S agreed in December to provide 10,000 guards for the venues, rather than the 2,000 originally asked for, increasing the value of the contract by almost \u00a3200m to \u00a3284m. This included \u00a383m to cover labour, and a 12-fold increase in management costs, from \u00a310m to \u00a3125m. G4S also secured a 22-fold increase to cover uniforms \u2013 from \u00a33m to \u00a365m. Margaret Hodge, chair of the committee, said: \"The chaos which has emerged over the security contract was predictable and undermines confidence in those responsible for managing the Games. \"No credible explanation has been given for an astonishing 12-fold hike in management costs and G4S still has not been able to deliver. Now troops are having to be drafted in. The Home Office needs to get a grip.\" She said the committee was worried that G4S will still \"receive substantial sums of public money without providing the contracted number of guards. Value for taxpayer's money demands G4S not only pays for all additional costs incurred by the government, but also incurs financial penalties for the failure to deliver.\" The committee, which has had fractious relationship with the DCMS and its permanent secretary Jonathan Stephens, also urged ministers to do a proper audit of exactly how much the Olympics had cost. The \u00a39.3bn budget does not include the \u00a3766m paid for the Olympic Park, or the funding of elite athletes or transport improvements in London. \"We have faced considerable difficulty in pinning down just how much the Games is costing the taxpayer and how much risk there is,'' said Hodge. \"A big concern is that [DCMS] has no intention of producing a single auditable account for the Games, drawing together both the costs within the public sector funding package of \u00a39.3bn and those outside. Such an analysis must be produced.\" David Cameron said on Wednesday he would \"go after\" G4S for not fulfilling its contract. Speaking during a trip to Afghanistan where he met British troops, the prime minister said: \"We will go after them for the money to make sure that they help pay for the military personnel that have been brought in.\" The sports minister, Hugh Robertson, said the government was also looking at reducing G4S's management fee by invoking penalty clauses. However, he dismissed calls for the firm's chief executive, Nick Buckles, to resign immediately, saying the Olympics needed \"stability\". \"What happens to Mr Buckles is a matter for others in a post-Games environment... the important thing is that we deliver a safe and secure Games, and G4S remain a key partner in that, so I want stability at that firm, and delivery. I don't want resignations causing chaos. What happens to Mr Buckles afterwards is a matter for others in the post-Games environment.\" The Labour leader, Ed Miliband, will on Thursday call for the government to review G4S's ability to deliver on policing contracts and for reassurance from the government that core functions such as beat patrol and criminal investigations will not be privatised. At Labour's police commissioner candidates' conference, he will say: \"What has happened over G4S demands that the government rethinks its position on the role of the private sector in policing.\" The culture secretary, Jeremy Hunt, defended the government's position. \"With just over a week to go we are on track to deliver a great Games on time and under budget. At the end of May there was \u00a3476m of contingency [money] unallocated and I am confident that we will deliver the project for under \u00a39bn,\" he said. \"We disagree with the Committee's assertion that the DCMS has lacked transparency. London 2012 has arguably been more transparent than any other public sector project. For example we have produced 16 financial updates to Parliament over the last four years.\"",

      "bodyText": "The privy council has blocked a multimillionaire speculator from taking up to $100m (\u00a364m) from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) for a decades old debt that started out at $3.3m. Peter Grossman, who runs so-called \"vulture fund\" FG Hemisphere, had tried to exploit a legal loophole to demand the impoverished African nation pay back the debt. But the privy council overturned a previous court ruling allowing FG Hemisphere to demand the multimillion-pound payout from DRC's state-owned mining company. In an attempt to skirt British law, which bans \"vulture funds\" from buying poor nations' debts on the cheap before suing them for 10-100 times the amount paid, Grossman took the case to Jersey, a crown dependency not covered by the UK law. The Jersey court had ruled the DRC's state-owned mining company G\u00e9camines should pay back the debt, which was originally a loan from the former Yugoslavia to Zaire, as DRC was then known, to build power lines 30 years ago. Bosnian police files, shown to the Guardian and Newsnight, reveal FG Hemisphere paid $3.3m for the Yugoslav power claim. Michael Sheehan, another so-called vulture who set up the deal and who chooses to refer to himself as Goldfinger after the James Bond villain, is said to have collected more than half a million dollars from setting up the deal. The privy council, which is the final court of appeal for Crown dependencies (including Jersey), ruled that G\u00e9camines is not responsible for the Congolese government's debts. The ruling means FG Hemisphere can no longer collect the debt via Jersey and the case may set a precedent making it harder for vulture funds and other sovereign debt creditors to collect funds from state-owned companies. Before turning to the Jersey loophole, Grossman's company had unsuccessfully tried to seize the DRC's embassy in Washington as a downpayment on the debt. A spokesman for Grossman said: \"We are obviously disappointed at the judgment delivered by the council.

The company, which describes itself as \"one of the world's leading energy and climate-change consultancies\", has been through significant changes of fortune since it was first separated from the UK Atomic Energy Authority in 1994 then floated two years later.

He was replaced as chief executive by the former managing director Andrew McCree, who was shown the door last November after issuing two profit warnings in seven months.

      "bodyText": "The trade minister, Lord Green, has been drawn in to the HSBC money laundering scandal after Labour warned he had \"serious questions\" to answer about the way the bank laundered money for drug cartels, terrorists and pariah states while he was at the helm. Green was chief executive of Britain's biggest bank between 2003 and 2006 and was its chairman until 2010 when he resigned to take up a position of trade minister in the coalition government. A damning Senate report - which concluded the bank had a \"pervasively polluted\" culture - covers the period 2004 to 2010 and shows that HSBC subsidiaries moved billions of dollars around the financial system from countries such as Iran and Syria as well moving cash for Mexican drug cartels. An example of an email reproduced in the report appears to show that Green was warned by HSBC's head of compliance David Bagley - who dramatically resigned during Tuesday's appearance before Senators - to alert him to a potential breach to the rules in relation to sanctions in trading with Burma. Bagley wrote there is a \"significant risk of financial penalty\" as there is \"little doubt that it is a breach\" of the sanctions (which were lifted in May this year). The report found that a new internal policy was introduced afterwards, but that transactions continued to occur. The report also shows that executives set up internal reviews to try to tackle the problems and referred themselves to the regulatory body. Chris Leslie, Labour's the shadow financial secretary to the Treasury, said on Wednesday: \"The US Senate sub-committee's report, which suggests that HSBC allowed money laundering by drug cartels and possibly even terrorists, is so serious that the bank's head of compliance has already resigned.\". \"Stephen Green, who was executive chairman of the bank when this took place and is now a trade minister in David Cameron's government, now has serious questions to answer about what he knew and when,\" said Leslie With the Commons in recess for the summer, Labour's leader in the Lords, Baroness Royall, tabled an urgent question to force a statement about Green's involvement but the request was rejected by Lords Speaker Baroness D'Souza. Green, who is also an advisor to the government on banks, was not available for comment following Leslie's remarks. A respected banking figure, who has been cited as potential candidate to be the next governor of the Bank of England, Green was also chairman of the British Bankers' Association during the time of the Libor-rigging scandal that led to the \u00a3290m fine on Barclays and the departure of chief executive bob Diamond. Labour was quick to call on Green to answer questions following the intense pressure that shadow chancellor Ed Balls faced from George Osborne following the Libor scandal which at one point risked drawing in former Labour ministers. Bagley's dramatic resignation during the Senate hearing on Tuesday, came as Paul Thurston, currently chief executive of retail banking and wealth management and former head of the UK bankat HSBC, and head of the Mexican banking business in 2007 and told Ssenators he was \"horrified\" by what he found. HSBC has been quick to apologise for the failings and Bagley told senators Carl Levin and Tom Coburn that: \"HSBC has fallen short of our own expectations and the expectations of our regulators.\" Danny Alexander, chief secretary to the Treasury, told the Today programme that the issues stemmed from the past: \"This is a reminder of the huge difficulties our banking system got into in the run-up to the banking crisis, the culture that existed then that led to all sorts of appalling and irresponsible behaviour from which this country is still suffering under the weight of the consequences from those mistakes,\" Alexander said. Labour peer Lord Foulkes claimed Lord Green was too \"embarrassed\" about his record to answer questions in Parliament. In the spotlight Aside from Lord Green, questions about the money laundering saga could also be asked of Sir John Bond, who was chairman of HSBC until May 2006 when he retired after 45 years with the bank when we was succeeded by Green. Bond has been chairman of Xstrata since May 2011 and was chairman of Vodafone until July 2011. Michael Geoghegan took over from Green as chief executive in May 2006, one of many assignments he had since joining the bank in 1973. He left in 2010 when Green's departure caused a boardroom tussle. Another long-standing HSBC executive Sandy Flockhart ran the Mexican operations from 2002 to 2006 but after a 37 year career his retirement from the bank was announced earlier this month to fight cancer.

      "bodyText": "The International Monetary Fund has warned the eurozone's leaders to take \"decisive action\" as Spanish bond yields shot up to dangerous levels, signalling a fresh leg of the sovereign debt crisis. In its annual report on the eurozone's policies, known as an Article IV, the IMF made clear that it believes euro ministers have not yet done enough to underpin the future of the single currency. It called for the European Central Bank to cut interest rates, implement a \"sizeable\" package of quantitative easing, and wade into bond markets to drive down borrowing costs. Madrid saw its 10-year bond yields \u2013 a proxy for how much the government must pay to borrow \u2013 hit 6.94% on Wednesday, close to the 7% level that many analysts consider to be unsustainable. Spain received a \u20ac100bn (\u00a378bn) bailout for its banking sector last month, and its prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, was regarded as having won a good deal from Germany in avoiding the painful conditions attached to rescue loans for Greece, Portugal and Ireland. But since he announced \u20ac65bn-worth of fresh spending cuts and tax rises last week, analysts have been slashing their Spanish growth forecasts and fretting about whether it will eventually need a full-blown bailout. The German finance minister, Wolfgang Scha\u00fcble, stoked the fearful mood, saying in an interview with the Rheiniche Post that Spain remained ultimately responsible for meeting the bank rescue costs. The IMF expressed concern about \"reinforced negative bank-sovereign linkages\" \u2013 the increasingly close connection between struggling banks, many sitting on billions of euros of government bonds; and their home states, which in many cases have been forced to offer them aid. This vicious circle \"could further weigh on confidence, growth, and public debt trajectories\", the IMF suggested. As Spain's borrowing costs rose, Germany was able to borrow money at a negative real yield \u2013 suggesting investors are effectively willing to pay Berlin for holding on to their cash. In its strongly worded report, the IMF warned that ultra-low bond yields in Germany and other \"core\" eurozone economies were a sign of malfunctioning financial markets that are depriving other countries of funds. \"Investors are withholding funding from member states most in need, moving capital 'north' and abroad to perceived safer assets. This has contributed to divergences in liquidity conditions and lending rates within the euro area, adding to already-severe pressures on many bank and sovereign balance sheets and raising questions about the viability of the monetary union itself,\" it said. The newly elected Greek government, which came to power promising to win a better deal from the country's creditors, is struggling to agree \u20ac11.5bn-worth of cuts being demanded by the troika of the ECB, IMF and European commission which are due in Athens next week. Grreece's finance minister, Yiannis Stournaras, emerged from fraught talks with fellow ministers on Wednesday night, saying: \"We still don't have concrete measures.\" Athens has said that it will seek a short-term bridging loan from eurozone partners to tide it over the summer months, while it tries to convince the troika to release the next tranche of its \u20ac130bn bailout. Alexis Tsipras, the leader of Greece's far-left Syriza opposition party, accused the governing coalition of drawing up a \"catastrophic plan\" of more painful austerity measures. \"The government is executing orders from the troika and is not serving the public interest,\" he said. The IMF warned that it expects the eurozone economy to contract by 0.3% this year, and eke out growth of just 0.7% in 2013; but even this may prove too optimistic, because there are, \"severe downside risks to the outlook, with possible substantial regional and global implications\".",

      "bodyText": "It was only a month ago that the financial world was full of talk that German bunds might not, after all, be the definition of a safe haven. Yields on 10-year bunds had been 1.2% on 1 June but hit 1.6% on the 20th. Two explanations were offered. First, investors were understandably nervous about locking in a miserable yield of 1.2% for a decade. Second, there was the thought that Germany would always blink in the euro crisis, agreeing to underwrite greater proportions of its neighbours' debts even if the process were dragged out over many years. The inevitable consequence of propping up the eurozone, it was felt, would be a rise in Germany's cost of borrowing. So much for that theory. Plunging yields on \"safe haven\" sovereign debt are back with force. On the 10-year, German yields stand at 1.2% again; over two years, investors are willing to suffer negative yields for the privilege of lending to Germany. The search for havens has swept up the UK and the US, where 10-year yields fell below 1.5% on Wednesday. What's more, UK 10-year gilt yields were actually marginally lower than on the equivalent US treasuries, perhaps reflecting the idea that the Bank of England currently looks keener than the US Federal Reserve to indulge in more quantitative easing, aka money-printing. What's going on? It seems to be the familiar explanation: brief excitement after the appearance of the eurozone's latest painkiller, in this case the bailout of Spain's banks, has been replaced by the realisation that nothing substantial has changed. In fact, the position may have worsened. The true nature of the Spanish bargain is now clear - the government in Madrid has adopted a massive austerity package in order to escape an official bailout. Such (dubious) virtue has brought no reward: Spanish 10-year yields are once again within a whisker of 7%. That, unfortunately, is no surprise. On the International Monetary Fund's forecasts, Spain will remain in recession next year - and a further heavy dose of spending cuts and pay freezes won't help. The net result is that the euro crisis has crawled out of the box again. HSBC, Barclays and G4S entertained us with their shenanigans, but now it's back to the euro slog. What's the next stage? Nobody knows, but Gary Jenkins of Swordfish Research makes a fair point when he argues that there is now a \"career risk\" for the average fixed-income fund manager in holding Spanish and Italian bonds. Their presence in a discretionary portfolio has become hard to explain to clients. The psychology is simple: in the disaster scenario of a eurozone break-up, you won't lose your job if you own German debt, but you will if you are over-burdened with Spanish and Italian IOUs. That leaves only Italian and Spanish banks as the natural buyers of Italian and Spanish debt. In the Spanish case, though, buying power is gradually weakening because the institutions are already stuffed to the brim with their sovereign's paper. What's the European Central Bank going to do? One theory is that, in the hope of stimulating economic activity, it might penalise banks for holding deposits centrally. For your average bond investor, though, that sounds like yet another reason to park money in expensive German bunds. And so the spiral goes on. Coming soon: the next eurozone crisis summit.",

But, they say, customers are determined to enjoy summer treats and strawberries remain one of their most popular products. Tesco customers, meanwhile, are cooking spicy food to make up for the cooler weather outside. Sales of searing hot Scotch Bonnet chillies shot up by 145% last week. Root vegetables were also in demand as Britons got out their casserole pots for warming winter food. Sales of baked potatoes jumped 92% and swedes were up 23%. But Britons are having to buy funny-looking vegetables as a result of the weather. Waitrose said this week it would support farmers through one of the wettest seasons on record by accepting \"cosmetically imperfect\" fruit and veg, such as \"shorter carrots, thinner parsnips or smaller strawberries than usual\". Travel British travel agents have reported a 20% rise in holiday searches in June compared with last year. ABTA, the travel trade group, estimates that up to 13 million UK holidaymakers will head overseas in July and August, with 90% going to the Mediterranean in search of the silver lining of the eurozone crisis \u2013 cheaper foreign stays. A pound now buys \u20ac1.28, compared with \u20ac1.14 a year ago. But with most people still to take their main holiday and last-minute booking becoming common practice, Britain's tourism industry says it is too early to tell how the weather will affect it. Sarah Long, of Visit England, said: \"According to our business confidence monitor, trade was down in May and June when the weather wasn't great but operators were still confident for the summer. The trend to book late is still very strong, so fingers crossed it will get better.\" Many regions are heavily promoting their indoor attractions. The Olympics effect has hit inbound tourism more than any rain: many businesses reported bookings down by 30-40% for this summer with foreign visitors put off by the prospect of higher prices and overcrowding. VisitBritain said its research shows that the exceptionally rainy weather barely figures in visitors' thinking \u2013 because most believe they are set for a wet stay anyway.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A 65,000 drop in the number of people without a job has been hailed by ministers as \"a step in the right direction\", but Labour and trades unions warned that short-term hiring for the Olympics was masking the economy's underlying weakness. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the number of people looking for work had fallen to 2.58 million in the three months to May, driving the unemployment rate down to 8.1% from 8.3% three months earlier. It said, however, the strong performance of London \u2013 with the capital registering 61,000 more people in employment over the period \u2013 could indicate the effect of the 2012 Olympics. A furious public spat erupted between the employment minister, Chris Grayling, and his Labour shadow, Liam Byrne, at the announcement. Byrne said the fall in unemployment was good news, but he cited claimant count numbers showing that long-term unemployment for young people had quadrupled over the past year. Grayling insisted that rise was due to the abolition of Labour schemes, such as the Future Jobs Fund, which had kept young people on training allowances instead of the dole. \"I cannot understand why you continue to deliberately misuse these figures,\" Grayling said in a public letter to Byrne. \"As both I and Iain Duncan Smith have explained the position to you many times now, I can only assume that you are deliberately trying to scaremonger.\" Dave Prentis, general secretary of Unison, said long-term unemployment across the economy remained high, and temporary Olympics jobs would not solve the jobs crisis. He said: \"The Olympic effect may give the impression of a recovery, but it is a mirage. The number of the long-term unemployed is still rising, and huge numbers of women and young people are still struggling to find work.\" The ONS figures show that 441,000 people have been out of a job for more than two years. Tom Hadley, of the Recruitment and Employment Confederation, said the unemployment rate was likely to veer about in the coming months. \"Tens of thousands of university, school and college leavers will be entering the job market over the summer and our latest data from recruiters shows hiring activity is slowing. The UK is making gradual progress out of recession and is likely to experience a zig-zag pattern with some good months followed by weaker ones,\" Hadley said. The more timely claimant-count measure of unemployment, which tracks the numbers receiving jobseeker's allowance (JSA), gave a conflicting signal: the numbers rose by 6,100 in June to a total of 1.6 million. However, the ONS said that tally could have been boosted by changes to the benefits regime for lone parents and incapacity benefit claimants, some of whom have been shifted to out-of-work benefits to bring them into the labour force. The number of women claiming JSA increased by 8,000 to 530,700, the highest level since 1995, and the ONS said the rise was likely to have been partly driven by the benefits rule changes. Youth unemployment, which the coalition government has sought to tackle through Nick Clegg's \"youth contract\", had fallen by 10,000, the ONS said. The jobless rate for 16- to 24-year-olds slipped to 21.9% in the three months to May from 22.1% three months earlier. The upbeat news about the labour market came as it emerged that two members of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee (MPC) dissented from the bank's decision to boost quantitative easing \u2013 the emergency policy of creating money to buy government bonds. Minutes of the nine-member MPC's July meeting \u2013 at which the committee opted to raise quantitative easing to \u00a3375bn to offset the turmoil in the economy \u2013 showed that the bank's chief economist, Spencer Dale, and Ben Broadbent, a former Goldman Sachs analyst, thought the move unnecessary. The minutes also showed that the MPC's members intended to reconsider the possibility of cutting interest rates from the record low of 0.5%, depending on the effectiveness of the government's Funding for Lending scheme, which offers low-cost loans to banks on condition they pass on the money to businesses and home buyers. The MPC said: \"Overall, there were reasons to believe that the scheme would provide a material economic stimulus. But it was too early to judge with any precision what the economic impact would be and when it might be felt.\"",

    "webTitle": "Bonds investors see UK as safer market than US", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The UK is now a safer haven than the US, according to the bond markets. Investors looking for safe places to put their money today drove the price of 10-year UK government bonds higher, pushing yields down to 1.47%. That is a touch lower than the US 10-year government bond at 1.48%, suggesting investors now consider the UK safer than the US. The move comes after minutes from the latest meeting of the monetary policy committee meeting showed that the Bank of England considered boosting the quantitative easing (QE) programme by more than the \u00a350bn it finally settled on two weeks ago. QE involves buying up UK government bonds, or gilts, which drives the price of gilts higher, pushing yields lower. That contrasts with the US, where Fed chairman Ben Bernanke fended off questions on Tuesday about whether the US central bank will offer a fresh round of monetary stimulus. Analysts said markets also react less to UK data than US data. Gary Jenkins of Swordfish Research says: \"Maybe the UK is just less important, maybe it benefits from the fact that every single piece of US data is analysed to death and, to a degree, the UK is slightly off the radar screen.\" The fall in the bond yield will be welcome news for chancellor George Osborne because it lowers the rate at which the UK can borrow money and Jenkins said he deserved a small amount of credit for the UK still being considered a safe haven. \"I suppose you have had some governments who have said we're going to carry on spending and they destroyed their credibility in the bond market very quickly. You could give [the government] credit for that.\" But he said there were more important factors at play, such as the fact that the UK has hundreds of years of history repaying its debts, has its own currency and a central bank willing to engage in quantitative easing, which reached a total of \u00a3375bn. Elsewhere in Europe, short-term bond yields have slipped into negative territory in six countries. Investors are, in effect, paying Germany, Finland, Denmark, Switzerland, the Netherlands and, most recently, Austria to lend them money for two years or less. In contrast, Spanish bond yields are moving towards the dangerous 7% mark and Italian bond yields are over 6%. Jenkins said this huge divergence in bond yields in Europe was very concerning. \"It doesn't make a lot of sense investing for a negative return. It makes more sense than putting it somewhere where you are worried that you wake up in the morning and find you've lost 25% of your capital. The negative yield story is a sign of people giving up hope on the fact that anything's going to happen in the short-term to turn it around.\" Investors are also betting on the possibility of a break-up of the euro. Mark Dowding, senior portfolio manager at credit hedge fund BlueBay Asset Management, explains: \"Arguably if you are buying a bond with a negative yield you are guaranteeing you get back less than you are paying for it in the first place. Your only chance of making a profit is in the hope you make a foreign exchange gain. The Danish krone is pegged to the euro. In a way, you are prepared to buy Danish bonds with a negative yield in the hope of the euro breaking up and the Danish krone going up in value versus the euro.\"",

      "body": "<p>The UK is now a safer haven than the US, according to the bond markets. Investors looking for safe places to put their money today drove the price of 10-year UK government bonds higher, pushing yields down to 1.47%. That is a touch lower than the US 10-year government bond at 1.48%, suggesting investors now consider the UK safer than the US.</p> <p>The move comes after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jul/18/bank-of-england-minutes-more-qe\" title=\"\">minutes from the latest meeting of the monetary policy committee meeting</a> showed that the Bank of England considered boosting the quantitative easing (QE) programme by more than the \u00a350bn it finally settled on two weeks ago. QE involves buying up UK government bonds, or gilts, which drives the price of gilts higher, pushing yields lower. That contrasts with the US, where Fed chairman Ben Bernanke fended off questions on Tuesday about whether the US central bank will offer a fresh round of monetary stimulus.</p> <p>Analysts said markets also react less to UK data than US data. Gary Jenkins of Swordfish Research says: \"Maybe the UK is just less important, maybe it benefits from the fact that every single piece of US data is analysed to death and, to a degree, the UK is slightly off the radar screen.\"</p> <p>The fall in the bond yield will be welcome news for chancellor George Osborne because it lowers the rate at which the UK can borrow money and Jenkins said he deserved a small amount of credit for the UK still being considered a safe haven. \"I suppose you have had some governments who have said we're going to carry on spending and they destroyed their credibility in the bond market very quickly. You could give [the government] credit for that.\"</p> <p>But he said there were more important factors at play, such as the fact that the UK has hundreds of years of history repaying its debts, has its own currency and a central bank willing to engage in quantitative easing, which reached a total of \u00a3375bn.</p> <p>Elsewhere in Europe, short-term bond yields have slipped into negative territory in six countries. Investors are, in effect, paying Germany, Finland, Denmark, Switzerland, the Netherlands and, most recently, Austria to lend them money for two years or less. In contrast, Spanish bond yields are moving towards the dangerous 7% mark and Italian bond yields are over 6%.</p> <p>Jenkins said this huge divergence in bond yields in Europe was very concerning. \"It doesn't make a lot of sense investing for a negative return. It makes more sense than putting it somewhere where you are worried that you wake up in the morning and find you've lost 25% of your capital. The negative yield story is a sign of people giving up hope on the fact that anything's going to happen in the short-term to turn it around.\"</p> <p>Investors are also betting on the possibility of a break-up of the euro. Mark Dowding, senior portfolio manager at credit hedge fund BlueBay Asset Management, explains: \"Arguably if you are buying a bond with a negative yield you are guaranteeing you get back less than you are paying for it in the first place. Your only chance of making a profit is in the hope you make a foreign exchange gain. The Danish krone is pegged to the euro. In a way, you are prepared to buy Danish bonds with a negative yield in the hope of the euro breaking up and the Danish krone going up in value versus the euro.\"</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Insurers are set to pay up to \u00a3500m to customers who have suffered flood and storm damage during one of Britain's wettest summers on record, according to the Association of British Insurers (ABI). The industry body said the \u00a317m-a-day losses were the worst since the summer of 2007, when flash floods landed insurers with a \u00a32.5bn bill. The insurer RSA has taken a \u00a350m hit from this summer's washout. The owner of the More Than brand said on Wednesday it had received more than 6,500 claims on UK home, motor and commercial property insurance and suffered a \u00a340m loss as a result in June. It has taken a further \u00a310m hit from the deluge since the start of July. Nearly 40% of the claims have been settled so far. Nick Starling, the ABI's director of general insurance, said: \"The widespread floods of this summer highlight how vital flood insurance is. During June alone, insurers helped 68,000 customers hit by the floods and storms.\" The industry is trying to hammer out a new flood agreement with the government, without which some homes in high-risk areas could be left without cover after next June, when the current agreement runs out. Analysts have warned that home insurance premiums, which are already rising, could go up further in the wake of the heavy rainfall. The areas worst affected by the storms, flooding and hail stones the size of golf balls are the east Midlands, the north-east and the north-west. RSA and its bigger rival Aviva face the biggest losses from storm damage. Barrie Cornes, insurance analyst at Panmure Gordon, said the cost to RSA was much higher than the \u00a38m to \u00a315m he had pencilled in, and blamed losses in commercial insurance as well as motor. He cut his annual earnings per share forecast for RSA by 14% to 11.98p. The total of RSA's losses from \"acts of God\" this summer is \u00a385m after the company, which operates in 140 countries and employs 23,000 people, added that two earthquakes in the Emilia-Romagna region of Italy in May resulted in a further \u00a335m loss. RSA has a 7% slice of the UK home insurance market and controls 15% of the commercial property market, with the losses split broadly equally between the two, plus a bit extra in motor cover, analysts estimate. Oliver Steel, insurance analyst at Deutsche Bank, said: \"RSA's losses would imply a total industry cost of the June/July storms combined of \u00a3450m.\" Based on Aviva's market shares of 11% for household and 15% for commercial property, he estimated a cost to Aviva of \u00a360m, which he considered \"manageable\". Companies that only offer home insurance are RBS with a 15% share of the market, Lloyds Banking Group with 13% and Legal &amp; General with 4%. This would imply a \u00a39m impact for L&amp;G. RSA's losses are far less than the \u00a3120m bill it had to foot after the widespread flood damage in Britain in 2007. Marcus Barnard at Oriel Securities said about RSA's hit: \"We don't think the UK losses should come as a particular surprise but are unhelpful.\" Shares in RSA dropped 1.3p, or 1.2%, to 107p on the news.",
