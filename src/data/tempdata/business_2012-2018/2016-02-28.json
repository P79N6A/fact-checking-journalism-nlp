      "bodyText": "The mining company Glencore has launched a legal bid against the Australian government to lower port access fees. In recently submitted filings before the Australian Competition Tribunal, Glencore Coal complained that increased fees to enter the newly privatised Newcastle port, which produces more than 170m tonnes of saleable coal a year, will \u201cmaterially impact on the profit margins of coal producers\u201d. The challenge comes amid diminished share prices for the multinational company and job cuts in its zinc production operations around the world. Their challenge followed the New South Wales\u2019s government decision to privatise the Newcastle port as part of a joint venture between Hastings Fund Management and China Merchants. The venture quickly increased port fees by between 40 per cent and 60 per cent for vessels to access the shipping channel. The appeal to the Australian Competition Tribunal concerns a decision by the then acting treasurer, Mathias Cormann, in 2015 when he ruled out \u201cdeclaring\u201d the port\u2019s fees. Had Cormann ruled in Glencore\u2019s favour, this would have allowed it to refer the access dispute to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission for arbitration and potentially allow Glencore to push for the port fees to be lowered. Although the tribunal battle will focus on technical issues surrounding competition laws, it touches on two critical policy areas for the Australian government; the privatisation of state assets and concerns about price increases, and the long-term viability of coalmining ventures in Australia. In the tribunal documents Glencore argues that the port\u2019s \u201cunconstrained price\u201d and the monopoly it holds over granting access to the port \u201ccreates uncertainty for producers and acquirers of Hunter Valley coal\u201d. The port\u2019s \u201cmonolopy power\u201d will \u201cmaterially impact on the profit margins of coal producers [miners] operating in the Hunter Valley, particularly in the current operating environment given many mines are cash flow negative\u201d. The Australian government has not yet responded to the application before the tribunal. The case will also be a test of the more limited types of review that can be conducted by the Australian Competition Tribunal in what are known as \u201caccess\u201d cases after new legislation passed in 2012. Glencore has faced financial difficulties after the company was floated on the stock market in 2011. While the share price began high, it has dropped considerably following the collapse of commodity prices.",

      "bodyText": "The former chief executive of Barclays is in line to receive a bonus worth half a million pounds, despite being sacked by the bank last summer. Antony Jenkins left the bank in July after three years in the top job, with the board saying that \u201ca new set of skills were required for the period ahead\u201d. When he left, Barclays said that his contract entitled him to 12 months\u2019 notice from the company. This meant that until 7 July 2016 he would continue to receive his existing salary of \u00a31.1m, an additional allowance worth \u00a3950,000 a year paid in shares, a pension allowance worth \u00a3363,000, and other benefits. He was also still eligible to receive a pro-rata bonus related to his performance in the first part of 2015. Barclays announces its annual results on Tuesday, and Sky News said the bank would announce a \u00a3500,000 bonus for Jenkins in the accompanying remuneration report. The figure, which the bank would not comment on, would amount to about a quarter of Jenkins\u2019 fixed pay. A share bonus scheme that was also performance related could yield further payouts worth several millions. The shares, which were awarded under a long-term incentive plan (LTIP), would only cover only his time at the bank. In 2015, after waiving payouts in his first two years at the bank, Jenkins accepted a bonus of \u00a31.1m, equal to 57% of the maximum he could receive. Combined with other incentives and benefits, his remuneration package added up to almost \u00a35.5m. In July, Barclays reported that although it had set aside \u00a31.8bn to cover fines for rigging foreign exchange markets and payouts to customers for mis-selling PPI and packaged bank accounts, its first-half profits had risen by 25% to \u00a33.1bn. In December it emerged that Jenkins had been told about his sacking in a phone call from the bank\u2019s chairman, John McFarlane. The traditional bankers\u2019 bonus season is in full swing, with RBS, HSBC and Lloyds already announcing their payouts for senior staff. On Friday the taxpayer-backed RBS defended a \u00a33.8m package for its chief executive, Ross McEwan, which came as it announced a \u00a32bn annual loss. The results for 2015 mean the bank has lost \u00a350bn since its 2008 bailout by the government. Meanwhile Mervyn King, the former governor of the Bank of England, warned that another financial crisis is \u201ccertain\u201d, because the banking system had not been reformed since the last crash. In an extract from his new book published in the Telegraph, Lord King wrote: \u201cWithout reform of the financial system, another crisis is certain, and the failure \u2026 to tackle the disequilibrium in the world economy makes it likely that it will come sooner rather than later.\u201d King wrote that the world recovery had been \u201cneither strong, nor sustainable, nor balanced. There seems little political willingness to be bold, and so perhaps we should fear that the size of the ultimate adjustment will just go on getting bigger.\u201d Central banks were locked into low interest rates, he added: \u201cThey are in a prisoner\u2019s dilemma: if any one of them were to raise interest rates, they would risk a slowing of growth and possibly another downturn.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "In the chaos that ensues after a natural disaster, getting vehicles to aid workers for transporting refugees and supplies can be impossible as roads are frequently blocked. An alternative, says Yuki Liu, chief operating officer of the car design firm OSVehicle, is to airlift them in sections and construct them on the ground. The idea is unworkable in the case of a standard car or 4x4 but possibly not for the Tabby Evo, an electric vehicle that can be shipped in parts and put together in an hour. The Tabby Evo is the latest version of a \u201cplatform\u201d car, which provides the bare bones of an electric vehicle \u2013 including the frame, suspension, steering systems, brakes, seats and wheels \u2013 on which companies, relief agencies and universities among others, can build and tweak their own vehicle by adding doors, interiors and a shell. The skeleton cars were created by Yuki\u2019s brother, Tin Hang Liu, and OSVehicle wants them to be an easier route into the automotive industry. This would end the need for years of research and development and hundreds of millions of pounds in investment. Along with vehicles for aid agencies, the company is working on projects where fleets are used for car-sharing or as delivery vehicles for packages. Yuki said: \u201cWe started to think about how to change automotives because it is the most complex industrial product that has not changed for [some] time. Our background in automotives made us understand that there was a lot of need for innovation there because everything was still made in the same way.\u201d Tin and Yuki, who were both born and raised in Italy, followed their father into the motor industry. They soon became interested in the idea of circular economies, in which resources are kept in use for as long as possible. In 2008, Tin was working in Silicon Valley when he came in contact with open-source hardware \u2013 designs for machines and devices that have been publicly released. He applied the principles to cars, where one vehicle would be able to achieve a number of functions. The Tabby Evo is the second version of the skeleton car. Available with two or four seats, the bare vehicle is charged from a plug socket and has a range of 75 miles (120km) , depending on the type of body attached to it, said Yuki. The maximum speed is 80mph (130kmh), but this can be capped at a lower number depending again on what it is being used for. When a company buys fleets of the vehicles \u2013 the minimum is 200 \u2013 they design the final vehicle and then buy and fit the seats, doors and other components separately. Batches of more than 500 four-seater vehicles cost just under $5,000 (\u00a33,500) each, although this price increases if fewer are ordered, according to the company\u2019s chief finance officer, Alberto Loddo. He said: \u201cTo make a new car model from scratch, you would need five to seven years and $100m to $200m. With our platform, we want to shorten that to one and a half to three years, depending on the complexity of the vehicle, and to $3m to $20m.\u201d An alternative is to download the designs for free from the OSVehicle website, in line with the open-source principle on which the company was founded. The motoring industry, which was previously the domain of a small number of established firms, has welcomed several new entrants in recent years. Apple has discussed plans for an autonomous vehicle with California\u2019s department of motor vehicles, while Google\u2019s self-driving car has also been developed. The OSVehicle units consist of parts that can be easily swapped without throwing away other working parts, which expands the vehicle\u2019s lifespan, said Yuki. Its core unit contains the most complex parts of a vehicle, which means it is stable and ready to use, she added. Loddo compares it to the Android operating system for mobile phones, where developers can freely access the software as a base on which to build apps. He said: \u201cThe automotive world and the tech world are merging but the only thing is that the automotive world is very slow and big, and not so fast to adapt to change.\u201d The aim is to remove barriers for entry to the market for smaller companies, which can build different designs on one core vehicle. The two-seat version is comparable to a Smart car, and the four-seater to a Mini Cooper, Loddo added. The company makes money by selling the vehicles and also by designing and engineering final products for firms that want to make new vehicles using the platform. So far, 10 projectsare in development, ranging from fleets of hundreds to those with thousands of cars, although the exact details are under wraps. A two-seater car by an Italian IT company using its own information and entertainment system will be launched in June. Yuki says she expects to see the first vehicles on the roads next year. Several projects are being developed in the Aquitaine region of France, including a car-sharing scheme, a delivery scheme and an agricultural programme, which is supported by the regional council. Among the more bizarre ideas are vehicles that could navigate the surface of Mars or ones that could fly. More realistic suggestions have come from small islands that would benefit from the easy transportation of the parts, said Yuki. Hotel chains are looking into whether fleets of electric vehicles could be used to transport tourists around Mediterranean islands. Future plans include developing the vehicles to saloon, 4x4 and mini-van sizes. \u201cWe are giving the possibility of new vehicles for a niche market,\u201d Yuki said.",

An alternative, says Yuki Liu, chief operating officer of the car design firm <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.osvehicle.com/\">OSVehicle</a>, is to airlift them in sections and construct them on the ground.</p> <p>The idea is unworkable in the case of a standard car or 4x4 but possibly not for the Tabby Evo, an electric vehicle that can be shipped in parts and put together in an hour.</p> <p>The Tabby Evo is the latest version of a \u201cplatform\u201d car, which provides the bare bones of an electric vehicle \u2013 including the frame, suspension, steering systems, brakes, seats and wheels \u2013 on which companies, relief agencies and universities among others, can build and tweak their own vehicle by adding doors, interiors and a shell.</p> <p>The skeleton cars were created by Yuki\u2019s brother, Tin Hang Liu, and OSVehicle wants them to be an easier route into the automotive industry. This would end the need for years of research and development and hundreds of millions of pounds in investment. Along with vehicles for aid agencies, the company is working on projects where fleets are used for car-sharing or as delivery vehicles for packages.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"91543aa2f0e4fa0935f813f75bc77df091ff114c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/91543aa2f0e4fa0935f813f75bc77df091ff114c/0_96_2048_1229/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Tabby Evo\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Tabby Evo is a \u2018bare bones\u2019 electric vehicle that can be tweaked and customised by customers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Simone Spada</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yuki said: \u201cWe started to think about how to change automotives because it is the most complex industrial product that has not changed for [some] time. Our background in automotives made us understand that there was a lot of need for innovation there because everything was still made in the same way.\u201d</p> <p>Tin and Yuki, who were both born and raised in Italy, followed their father into the motor industry. They soon became interested in the idea of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/series/circular-economy\">circular economies</a>, in which resources are kept in use for as long as possible. In 2008, Tin was working in Silicon Valley when he came in contact with open-source hardware \u2013 designs for machines and devices that have been publicly released. He applied the principles to cars, where one vehicle would be able to achieve a number of functions.</p> <p> The Tabby Evo is the second version of the skeleton car. Available with two or four seats, the bare vehicle is charged from a plug socket and has a range of 75 miles (120km) , depending on the type of body attached to it, said Yuki. The maximum speed is 80mph (130kmh), but this can be capped at a lower number depending again on what it is being used for.</p> <p>When a company buys fleets of the vehicles \u2013 the minimum is 200 \u2013 they design the final vehicle and then buy and fit the seats, doors and other components separately. Batches of more than 500 four-seater vehicles cost just under $5,000 (\u00a33,500) each, although this price increases if fewer are ordered, according to the company\u2019s chief finance officer, Alberto Loddo.</p> <p>He said: \u201cTo make a new car model from scratch, you would need five to seven years and $100m to $200m. With our platform, we want to shorten that to one and a half to three years, depending on the complexity of the vehicle, and to $3m to $20m.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/may/28/google-self-driving-car-how-does-it-work\">Google's self-driving car: How does it work and when can we drive one?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>An alternative is to download the designs for free from the OSVehicle website, in line with the open-source principle on which the company was founded. The motoring industry, which was previously the domain of a small number of established firms, has welcomed several new entrants in recent years. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/sep/18/apple-meets-california-officials-self-driving-car\">Apple</a> has discussed plans for an autonomous vehicle with California\u2019s department of motor vehicles, while <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/may/28/google-self-driving-car-how-does-it-work\">Google\u2019s</a> self-driving car has also been developed.</p> <p>The OSVehicle units consist of parts that can be easily swapped without throwing away other working parts, which expands the vehicle\u2019s lifespan, said Yuki. Its core unit contains the most complex parts of a vehicle, which means it is stable and ready to use, she added. Loddo compares it to the Android operating system for mobile phones, where developers can freely access the software as a base on which to build apps.</p> <p>He said: \u201cThe automotive world and the tech world are merging but the only thing is that the automotive world is very slow and big, and not so fast to adapt to change.\u201d </p> <p>The aim is to remove barriers for entry to the market for smaller companies, which can build different designs on one core vehicle. The two-seat version is comparable to a Smart car, and the four-seater to a Mini Cooper, Loddo added. </p> <p>The company makes money by selling the vehicles and also by designing and engineering final products for firms that want to make new vehicles using the platform. So far, 10 projectsare in development, ranging from fleets of hundreds to those with thousands of cars, although the exact details are under wraps. A two-seater car by an Italian IT company using its own information and entertainment system will be launched in June. Yuki says she expects to see the first vehicles on the roads next year. </p> <p>Several projects are being developed in the Aquitaine region of France, including a car-sharing scheme, a delivery scheme and an agricultural programme, which is supported by the regional council.</p> <p>Among the more bizarre ideas are vehicles that could navigate the surface of Mars or ones that could fly. More realistic suggestions have come from small islands that would benefit from the easy transportation of the parts, said Yuki. </p> <p>Hotel chains are looking into whether fleets of electric vehicles could be used to transport tourists around Mediterranean islands. Future plans include developing the vehicles to saloon, 4x4 and mini-van sizes. \u201cWe are giving the possibility of new vehicles for a niche market,\u201d Yuki said.</p>",

Since the Tories took full control of the energy agenda in spring last year there has been a bonfire of much-needed subsidies for wind and solar, using the excuse of customer \u201caffordability\u201d.

In the end these are indeed just words on a page and do not, for instance, commit companies to build much-needed power stations: British Gas parent Centrica admitted recently that it had zero investment in new plants. As a statement of intent though, it is very important even if, as Slade has hinted, not every one of his members supports it as strongly as others. The change in attitude is probably due to several factors: the Paris climate change talks; new personnel (Slade took over recently from the \u201ctraditionalist\u201d former Conservative minister Angela Knight and Centrica has swapped its boss too); and a realisation that Energy UK has been on the wrong side of a carbon argument for too long.

      "bodyText": "The UK\u2019s biggest energy lobbying group has shifted its position on green energy and will start campaigning for low-carbon alternatives for the first time, in what environmental campaigners are describing as a watershed moment. Lawrence Slade, the chief executive of Energy UK, which represents the big six providers and has been regarded as a defender of fossil fuels, said the shift was urgent in order not to be left behind. \u201cNo one wants to be running the next Nokia,\u201d he said, referring to the mobile phone company that was overtaken by forward-looking rivals. \u201cI want to drive change and move away from accepted (old-style) thinking.\u201d This is a major turnaround for an organisation that has historically been criticised by consumer and green groups as a dinosaur protecting the vested interest of incumbent supply companies such as British Gas, SSE and others. Energy UK now officially supports the government\u2019s phasing out of coal-fired power stations and is critical of ministers over the way they have cut subsidies to wind and solar power so deeply and suddenly. Slade accepts that the big six, along with ministers, have made plenty of mistakes in the past but he says it is now time to develop a national plan that everyone - especially consumers - can buy into. Slade said: \u201cIt would be quite a sensible thing to have an Energiewende [Germany\u2019s plan to move to a majority of renewable energy sources] but the emphasis would have to be on our own version not a direct cut and paste.\u201d The German energy transition programme has attracted support but also some criticism. Slade, who formally took over the top job last summer, was talking following the publication of Energy UK\u2019s Pathways to 2030 policy document prepared with the help of professional service company, KPMG. Amid concern about the lights going out, 60 local authorities argued last week that coal-fired power stations should be kept open, but Slade surprisingly disagrees, saying we need lower-carbon solutions. Energy UK wants to see more demand reduction, plus regulatory changes, to help support electricity storage projects that help balance out the peaks and troughs caused by wind and solar power. Slade also believes urgent action is required to encourage power companies to keep existing gas-fired plants running, as well as the provision of aid to make it worthwhile for new ones to be constructed. Energy UK is calling for much more long-term thinking and financing. It says that details on the levy control framework of subsidy levels should be published so that investors have a clear picture up to 2025. Slade believes onshore windfarms should be allowed access to new forms of subsidies and says that aid cuts since the last election have undermined investor confidence. He said: \u201cEnergy policy is not as yet coherent. It is becoming clearer but more needs to be done. Investment is there but not forthcoming because there is not black and white clarity [on government policy]. The abruptness of some of the cuts and the scale of some of the cuts have alarmed people.\u201d Slade said he is keen to move on from arguments of the past and concentrate on solutions as Britain moves away from big central power stations to a more decentralised system of energy. Catherine Mitchell, a professor of energy policy at the University of Exeter and a champion of the low-carbon economy, welcomed the apparent U-turn by Slade\u2019s organisation. She said: \u201cEnergy UK is the conventional industry lobby, and is generally at the conservative end of arguments. This [Pathways] report reads almost as if they have \u2018flipped\u2019 to the other side. I take this to mean that their members realise that their future is in the \u2018new\u2019 energy system rather than the \u2018old\u2019, and this is to be welcomed.\u201d Richard Black, the director of the non-profit Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, also viewed Energy UK\u2019s new stance as positive. He said: \u201cThe report shows that experts across the industry see a time of tremendous change ahead for the electricity system, with the traditional utility model increasingly outdated. He added: \u201cFalling demand, increasingly competitive renewables, storage, interconnectors, demand response \u2013 this is the blueprint for the electricity system just 15 years hence, and it\u2019s telling that it comes from an industry body rather than a \u2018green\u2019 thinktank.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Stealth tax enthusiast George Osborne is gearing up for more of the same subterfuge at his next budget. With only a fortnight to go before he stands up in parliament to repeat his warning of gathering storm clouds and the even more fear-inducing cocktail of threats from a worsening global economy, he is morphing, if only in this respect, into Gordon Brown, who always had a keen eye for a stealth tax. Free from the constraints of coalition politics, the chancellor is adopting the same tactics as Brown, whose penchant for devising under-the-radar taxes to balance the books became a hallmark of his tenure at No 11. And these heavily disguised taxes, so much a feature of the Brown years, are essential because Osborne too believes that fiddling with the headline rates of tax on personal wealth and income is political suicide. The Institute for Fiscal Studies warned us in the two years running up to the last election that tax rises were coming. It said there was no way to achieve the aim of reducing the deficit, all other things staying the same, without raising money from extra tax. Osborne always dodged the question. The IFS, which will carry out its annual assessment of the public finances 24 hours after the budget, has often warned against stealth taxes to no avail. And so it was that last year the chancellor slapped a huge tax hike on insurance cover. The rise from 6% to 9.5% in insurance premium tax in the 2015 summer budget added an extra \u00a3100 to the annual cost of insurance for many households, according to the industry, which is probably an underestimate given the Treasury says the extra tax will raise more than \u00a38bn over the next five years. It\u2019s clever to make us all resent our insurers rather than the chancellor of the day, that\u2019s for sure, which is why the insurance industry is currently begging the Treasury not to repeat the trick. Insurers are also pleading with officials at N0 11 to drop their ideas for reforming tax on pension saving. In this instance, reform is another word for a stealthy revenue earner by way of a cut in the amount of tax relief available to savers. It is another rich vein to tap. Estimates put the amount of tax relief on pension savings at anywhere between \u00a320bn and \u00a335bn. Osborne has already added \u00a3500m to the exchequer by limiting the lifetime limit on pension savings. This limit, introduced by Brown, imposes a punitive tax on savings above a certain amount. Brown started with a figure of \u00a31.5m and raised it over time to \u00a31.8m. The chancellor has cut it to \u00a31.25m and announced a further cut to \u00a31m from April. It still sounds like a lot of money, but \u00a31m in a pension pot translates into a retirement income of around \u00a340,000 a year. And while this is a stupendously good pension when in all likelihood the recipient has very few outgoings, it captures thousands of middle-income earners, from deputy headteachers to BP engineers and Topshop store managers. A further cut in tax relief would come from reducing the higher rate of tax relief from 40%, which would affect people lower down the scale on incomes of about \u00a340,000 a year and above. Getting back to the stealth aspect, few people understand how their pensions work, let alone the effect of tax relief on a fund\u2019s ability to compound over time into a large pot of savings. They will probably keep putting away the same proportion of their salary month-in-month-out, not realising that the contribution from the government has been cut. Over time, savers will come to realise what a poor deal pensions offer without huge amounts of government support, but Osborne will be long gone. Another revenue-raiser is the Treasury-sanctioned increase in council tax from April. This is supposed to go some way towards filling the gap left by huge cuts in local-authority funding that in many cases, especially inner-city Labour-run councils, will amount to more than 50% between 2010 and 2020. Until now the Treasury has provided a financial incentive for councils to freeze the tax: by handing cash to compliant councils. Not any more. So really, councils are only making up what was lost from the incentive\u2019s withdrawal. The IFS has warned against rises in council tax without root-and-branch reform because it regressively targets poorer households, leaving those in expensive homes to pay proportionately less. Few council tax payers in low-value homes realise how the failure to reassess house values since the early 1990s has worked against them, leaving increases in the tax to do their redistributive worst by stealth, and better still, at arm\u2019s-length from the Treasury. Another revenue-earner is the apprenticeship levy. This will raise \u00a33bn a year for the exchequer from large and medium-sized businesses. This is not only a stealthy way to gather funds, it also fits with another Osborne tactic, which is kicking government costs down the road. The apprenticeship levy will, in time, be revenue-neutral once the government has built a computer system to run it and the money is doled out to fund apprenticeships. But in the meantime it is booked in the government accounts as a boost to the public finances. The costs are for another day. This is similar to the multibillion-pound transformation of university funding, which is reliant on upfront funding from a debt vehicle \u2013 the Student Loans Company \u2013 and the repayment over many years by graduates. Whether that happens or not is for a chancellor of the future to deal with. In the meantime, Osborne can be expected to maintain his course, preserving the tax rates of his core audience and where he adds a little extra to maintain his deficit reduction course, making sure they pay extra without knowing how it happened or that he is to blame.",

      "bodyText": "In or out? It\u2019s time to shake a few more ideas about. More than 200 business leaders have signed a letter calling for Britain to remain in the EU. Over the next few weeks David Cameron will regurgitate their views as he campaigns in favour of staying in by warning of the damaging effect leaving could have on the economy. It was to be expected that the leaders of Britain\u2019s biggest companies would want to maintain the status quo. They are, after all, already the biggest companies. Why would they put that at risk? They are already facing a slowdown in China, major technological changes, and a slide in global stock markets, let alone issues within their own markets and companies. Brexit is one thing they could do without. In contrast, leaders of businesses that thrive on instability and uncertainty, such as hedge funds, have come out in favour of Brexit. These include the chief economist at Toscafund, who warned earlier this month that Britain would be a \u201cbetter place\u201d outside the EU, and Crispin Odey. There are of course exceptions, based on the political views of an individual boss or particular EU regulations. Tim Martin of JD Wetherspoon appears to tick both boxes. Others on the \u201cout\u201d side include Snappy Snaps owner John Timpson, while JCB boss Lord Bamford has said at least we should not \u201cfear\u201d Brexit. However, the battle lines are fairly clear. It would be a shame, therefore, if businesses did not try to contribute more to the debate over the next few months than simply allowing Cameron to act as if their letter was a welcome surprise. The fact that only a third of FTSE 100 companies signed the letter is the more striking fact. Unfortunately, few businesses have stepped up to the mark so far. Whitbread, owner of Costa and Premier Inn, did not sign the letter but said in a separate statement that the impact on the company is likely to be \u201crelatively minor\u201d. But it added: \u201cHowever, the uncertainty arising from a vote to exit and the subsequent potentially lengthy negotiations could negatively affect consumer confidence and the general economic outlook in the UK, which would be both unwelcome and potentially damaging to our business. On this basis, we believe that Whitbread\u2019s best interests are served by remaining within the EU.\u201d The views of Britain\u2019s businesses on Brexit are more enlightening when you prod them on what it could mean for their day-to-day operations. Both Unilever, which signed, and ARM, which didn\u2019t, say that if Britain voted to leave the EU it probably would not affect operations because there are many other reasons to invest in the UK, and both firms have been based here a long time. Akio Toyoda, boss of carmaker Toyota, made similar remarks. It is also telling that HSBC has decided to keep its headquarters in Britain despite the Brexit threat, and that the merger between the London Stock Exchange and Deutsche B\u00f6rse appears to be carrying on regardless. Ultimately, businesses are pragmatic, so their reasons for wanting to stay or go could be enlightening for voters struggling to comprehend what is actually on offer. Engine maker Rolls-Royce has said it has drawn up contingency plans. Again, it would be far more helpful for chief executive Warren East to say what these plans were rather than putting his name to an inane letter warning that Brexit could put jobs at risk. If businesses believe they have a duty to get involved in the debate, they should start by helping their own staff understand how it could affect them, then do the same with their customers. Those who genuinely believe in the EU and the single market should be leading the way. If they don\u2019t, the Remain campaign risks being hijacked by doom-laden letters signed with encouragement from the government press office. And that\u2019s no way to have a debate. BT deserved a broadband broadside Rhetoric in the telecoms industry has turned increasingly vitriolic in the past few years amid a fierce battle over TV sports rights and bickering over the development of ultra-fast broadband. For Sharon White, a relative telecoms rookie one year into the job of Ofcom chief executive, the change of tone has come as something of a shock. Speaking after the telecoms regulator delivered its view on the future of Openreach \u2013 the division of BT that houses Britain\u2019s broadband network \u2013 the former Treasury mandarin declared that her \u201cChristmas card list will be a bit shorter this year\u201d. The thrust of her verdict was that stripping BT of its control of Openreach would be too costly and complex, even if it might in theory deliver benefits. Instead, BT was ordered to make it easier for rivals to use its network of telegraph poles and ducts \u2013 underground pipes \u2013 to deliver ultra-fast fibre optic broadband to the home. The nuclear option of full separation was left hanging over BT if it did not cooperate. BT\u2019s rivals, who complain of poor service from Openreach and achingly slow roll-out of fibre, see the decision as a cop-out. But there is a smart piece of call-my-bluff logic at the heart of Ofcom\u2019s decision to take the middle ground. If the likes of Sky and TalkTalk are serious about building cable networks, the way is now clearer than ever for them to do so, to the benefit of all internet customers. However, BT chief executive Gavin Patterson made it pretty clear that he didn\u2019t expect to be fielding many calls from competitors keen to get started right away. He might be right. It will take a lot of money and effort to get from the UK\u2019s current level of 2% coverage for ultra-fast fibre to the 70% currently enjoyed in Japan. But it must be the right thing for BT \u2013 whose tentacles now stretch through telecoms, TV and, via its takeover of EE, mobile \u2013 to be put on notice that it cannot have things all its own way. Ofcom\u2019s next review will be in 2026. In the meantime, the regulator would do well to stop telecoms firms trading brickbats so that they can focus on delivering the technological advances that people and businesses need to prosper. Still coining it What happened to public outrage over bankers\u2019 earnings? A few years ago, this weekend\u2019s news of the top man at RBS being paid \u00a33.8m in a loss-making year would have caused a stink. Back in 2012, former chief executive Stephen Hester chose to waive his \u00a31m bonus amid the threat of a Commons vote. These days, there\u2019s barely a squeak. True, current RBS chief Ross McEwan gave half his \u201crole-based allowance\u201d of \u00a31m to charity, but he still earned more last year than Hester ever did \u2013 despite the share price dropping to 2012 levels. Over at Lloyds, the other bailed-out bank, the trio of top executives has shared \u00a340m between them in the past two years. Yes, Lloyds has improved faster than RBS, but that\u2019s still a staggering sum. Why the near-silence? Well, Labour\u2019s Jeremy Corbyn, surprisingly, doesn\u2019t seem interested. Chancellor George Osborne just wants to get rid of the state\u2019s bank shares. Mostly, the bankers, by declaring that they have learned \u201crestraint\u201d, have persuaded the outside world that times have changed. It doesn\u2019t look like it.",

And that\u2019s no way to have a debate.</p> <h2>BT deserved a broadband broadside<br></h2> <p>Rhetoric in the telecoms industry has turned increasingly vitriolic in the past few years amid a fierce battle over TV sports rights and bickering over the development of ultra-fast broadband.</p> <p>For Sharon White, a relative telecoms rookie one year into the job of Ofcom chief executive, the change of tone has come as something of a shock.</p> <p>Speaking after the telecoms regulator delivered its view on the future of Openreach \u2013 the division of BT that houses Britain\u2019s broadband network \u2013 the former Treasury mandarin declared that her \u201cChristmas card list will be a bit shorter this year\u201d.</p> <p>The thrust of her verdict was that stripping BT of its control of Openreach would be too costly and complex, even if it might in theory deliver benefits. Instead, BT was ordered to make it easier for rivals to use its network of telegraph poles and ducts \u2013 underground pipes \u2013 to deliver ultra-fast fibre optic broadband to the home. The nuclear option of full separation was left hanging over BT if it did not cooperate.</p> <p>BT\u2019s rivals, who complain of poor service from Openreach and achingly slow roll-out of fibre, see the decision as a cop-out. But there is a smart piece of call-my-bluff logic at the heart of Ofcom\u2019s decision to take the middle ground. If the likes of Sky and TalkTalk are serious about building cable networks, the way is now clearer than ever for them to do so, to the benefit of all internet customers.</p> <p>However, BT chief executive Gavin Patterson made it pretty clear that he didn\u2019t expect to be fielding many calls from competitors keen to get started right away.</p> <p>He might be right. It will take a lot of money and effort to get from the UK\u2019s current level of 2% coverage for ultra-fast fibre to the 70% currently enjoyed in Japan. But it must be the right thing for BT \u2013 whose tentacles now stretch through telecoms, TV and, via its takeover of EE, mobile \u2013 to be put on notice that it cannot have things all its own way.</p> <p>Ofcom\u2019s next review will be in 2026. In the meantime, the regulator would do well to stop telecoms firms trading brickbats so that they can focus on delivering the technological advances that people and businesses need to prosper.</p> <h2>Still coining it</h2> <p>What happened to public outrage over bankers\u2019 earnings? A few years ago, this weekend\u2019s news of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/26/rbs-chief-executive-ross-mcewan-pay-2bn-loss-results-royal-bank-of-scotland\" title=\"\">top man at RBS being paid \u00a33.8m in a loss-making year</a> would have caused a stink. Back in 2012, former chief executive Stephen Hester chose to waive his \u00a31m bonus amid the threat of a Commons vote.</p> <p>These days, there\u2019s barely a squeak. True, current RBS chief Ross McEwan gave half his \u201crole-based allowance\u201d of \u00a31m to charity, but he still earned more last year than Hester ever did \u2013 despite the share price dropping to 2012 levels.</p> <p>Over at Lloyds, the other bailed-out bank, the trio of top executives has shared \u00a340m between them in the past two years. Yes, Lloyds has improved faster than RBS, but that\u2019s still a staggering sum.</p> <p>Why the near-silence? Well, Labour\u2019s Jeremy Corbyn, surprisingly, doesn\u2019t seem interested. Chancellor George Osborne just wants to get rid of the state\u2019s bank shares. Mostly, the bankers, by declaring that they have learned \u201crestraint\u201d, have persuaded the outside world that times have changed. It doesn\u2019t look like it.</p>",

Obviously the LSE numbers are going to be completely overshadowed by another attempt by these companies to get together. They first agreed to merge in 2000 before a rival bid for the LSE from Sweden\u2019s OM Gruppen scuppered the plan. The Swedish offer was then rejected anyway.

Developing. More feng shui at Barclays Barclays chairman John McFarlane likes rearranging stuff. His adherence to feng shui means he\u2019s supposedly ditched the bank\u2019s fleet of black executive cars and replaced them with a set of silver limousines (apparently silver or grey vehicles bring greater harmony to their users), but what he really likes doing is shuffling chief executives. He ousted Andrew Moss as chief executive at Aviva before he had even arrived full-time as chairman, but seemed to be slowing down at Barclays, where he waited about three months after taking the chair to whack Antony Jenkins. That might be why few believe him when he insists he hates the nickname \u201cMack the knife\u201d. Anyway, having eased Jenkins out last summer, the City gets its first view this week of the figure McFarlane put in his place: Jes Staley, the American former investment banker who arrived from JP Morgan at the end of last year. McFarlane has promised to allow Staley to get on with his job \u2013 which some might say is a novel approach \u2013 and so far the bank seems to be trying to suggest that he will be continuing with Jenkins\u2019s strategy. Until that plan gets rearranged. Glencore gets out of a hole? They used to say that Ivan Glasenberg, boss of commodity-trading-giant-cum-miner Glencore, was the world\u2019s canniest trader \u2013 but that was before he exchanged his \u00a36bn paper fortune for one worth around \u00a31.5bn. He actually got down to his last billion at one point after \u2013 among other things \u2013 a heroic overpayment when acquiring miner Xstrata and the subsequent collapse of world commodity prices, which have combined to cause Glencore shares to slump to about 130p from a float price of 530p. Anyway, with Glencore about to announce its full-year results this week, the notion that these chaps might need to rediscover their stellar trading reputation is coming back into vogue. Profits from the mining division have evaporated, meaning that an unprecedented 76% of earnings came from the group\u2019s trading activities in the first half of last year. That percentage is likely to rise when the numbers are announced on Tuesday, when Glasenberg will also update the market on how he is getting along with reducing the group\u2019s debts.

      "bodyText": "Seven years ago this week, the Bank of England cut interest rates to 0.5% \u2013 the lowest since the central bank was founded in 1694. In a drastic bid to stem the fallout from the global financial crisis, then governor Mervyn King and his fellow policymakers also kicked off the process of pumping tens of billions of pounds into the economy. Unsurprisingly, Labour chancellor Alistair Darling welcomed the flood of money. The economy had been battered by recession, house prices were falling and unemployment was high. There have been two changes of government since then. And at the Bank too, a new man is in charge; Mark Carney came over from Canada to replace King in 2013. All of the nine people who voted for those record low borrowing costs in March 2009 have left the monetary policy committee. Those years have seen periodic warnings from economists and policymakers that interest rates would have to rise soon. But the dog never barked and here we are: marking yet another year of record low rates. They have been seven lean years for savers but seven years of tailwinds if you happen to be a finance minister. Ultra-loose monetary policy was the backdrop throughout the coalition\u2019s time in office. It was the first government since the 1940s to enjoy unchanged borrowing costs for its entire term. The way things are going, this parliament may be little different. As if to mark this unenviable anniversary, a whole host of commentators have been coming out to say monetary policy cannot do all the heavy lifting. As finance ministers around the world were setting off for the G20 meeting in Shanghai, the International Monetary Fund issued a call for them to boost public spending on infrastructure to fuel global growth. The power of monetary policy was beginning to wane, the IMF said, and those governments that could safely increase their spending should step up to the plate and act together. In a separate report on the UK, the IMF urged the government to be ready to ease back on austerity should the economy slow further. That all echoed pleas by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) for its rich-country members to let up on austerity and collectively agree to spend more on infrastructure projects. Low interest rates and money creation by central banks were no longer enough for recovery, the thinktank warned. Carney has been quick to dismiss the argument put forward recently that central bankers are out of ammunition. But he also joined the chorus calling for finance ministers to do their bit. Speaking in Shanghai on Friday, he accused the G20 of failing to adopt measures to boost global growth. \u201cThe G20 needs to use the time purchased by monetary policy to develop a coherent and urgent approach to supply-side policies,\u201d he said. The Bank governor was scathing about progress on a 2014 pledge to lift the level of G20 GDP by at least 2% by 2018. \u201cLess than half of the measures have been implemented, and only around one third of the promised impact on global GDP has been delivered,\u201d Carney observed. As it happened, the Shanghai meeting ended with their joint recognition that \u201cmonetary policy alone cannot lead to balanced growth\u201d. But based on past pledges, central bankers should not get their hopes up that much will change. One has to wonder why it has taken so long for warnings about austerity to be voiced. Until recently the OECD had strongly backed George Osborne\u2019s deficit reduction programme. Such support emboldened the chancellor to talk about \u201cfixing the roof while the sun is shining\u201d. And how did he respond to the latest warnings? With defiance. \u201cStorm clouds\u201d were gathering in the world economy, with dangers for the UK, Osborne said in Shanghai. Time to get down off the roof, then, one would think. Most certainly not, the chancellor insisted. After UK growth slowed last year, it was in fact more important than ever to keep cutting, Osborne told the BBC in an interview. \u201cSo we may need to undertake further reductions in spending because this country can only afford what it can afford \u2013 and we will address that in the budget, because I\u2019m absolutely clear we\u2019ve got to root our country in the principle that we must live within our means,\u201d he said. So it appears if you are Osborne, you do not need sunshine to cut spending after all. Not that any of his tinkering with the roof since 2010 has really been carried out in the glow of economic fair weather: just rays of artificial light from a loose monetary policy. Now that storm clouds are gathering, Osborne\u2019s austerity looks even more ill-timed. That view is backed up in new research from economists at the University of California, Davis. Only a strong economy can bear a programme of austerity without significant output losses, argue professors \u00d2scar Jord\u00e0 and Alan Taylor in the February issue of the Economic Journal. According to their analysis, a fiscal consolidation of 1% of GDP translates into a loss of 3.5% of real GDP over five years when implemented in a slump, rather than a loss of just 1.8% in a boom. Applying that to the UK post-2007, they found that, without austerity, UK real output in 2013 would have been steadily climbing above its 2007 peak, rather than staying 2% below. Right now, the UK and world economies are looking shaky and yet Osborne refuses to put aside his wrecking ball. It is time he realised that central banks can only do so much.",

With defiance. \u201cStorm clouds\u201d were gathering in the world economy, with dangers for the UK, <a href=\"http://viewer.gutools.co.uk/proxy/preview/politics/2016/feb/26/george-osborne-further-cuts-storm-clouds-economic-budget\" title=\"\">Osborne said in Shanghai</a>. Time to get down off the roof, then, one would think. Most certainly not, the chancellor insisted. After UK growth slowed last year, it was in fact more important than ever to keep cutting, Osborne told the BBC in an interview.</p> <p>\u201cSo we may need to undertake further reductions in spending because this country can only afford what it can afford \u2013 and we will address that in the budget, because I\u2019m absolutely clear we\u2019ve got to root our country in the principle that we must live within our means,\u201d he said.</p> <p>So it appears if you are Osborne, you do not need sunshine to cut spending after all. Not that any of his tinkering with the roof since 2010 has really been carried out in the glow of economic fair weather: just rays of artificial light from a loose monetary policy. Now that storm clouds are gathering, Osborne\u2019s austerity looks even more ill-timed.</p> <p>That view is backed up in new research from economists at the University of California, Davis. Only a strong economy can bear a programme of austerity without significant output losses, argue professors \u00d2scar Jord\u00e0 and Alan Taylor <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ecoj.12332/abstract\" title=\"\">in the February issue of the <em>Economic Journal</em></a>. According to their analysis, a fiscal consolidation of 1% of GDP translates into a loss of 3.5% of real GDP over five years when implemented in a slump, rather than a loss of just 1.8% in a boom.</p> <p>Applying that to the UK post-2007, they found that, without austerity, UK real output in 2013 would have been steadily climbing above its 2007 peak, rather than staying 2% below.</p> <p>Right now, the UK and world economies are looking shaky and yet Osborne refuses to put aside his wrecking ball. It is time he realised that central banks can only do so much.</p>",
