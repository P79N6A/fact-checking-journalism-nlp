      "bodyText": "Housing affordability remains an absolutely red hot political issue as well as a complex policy one. It requires a government willing to embrace, as Malcolm Turnbull suggested back in September 2015, \u201ca style of leadership that respects the people\u2019s intelligence, that explains these complex issues\u201d. And for a brief shining moment this week it seemed that was about to happen; but within hours the darkness and normal procedures returned. The complexity of housing affordability was highlighted this week in a speech by the Reserve Bank assistant governor, Luci Ellis. Speaking at the Australasian Housing Researchers Conference, Ellis suggested that compared with other nations, housing affordability in Australia was \u201csomewhere around the middle of the pack\u201d. She also pointed out that changing social factors such as people marrying and starting families later in life could be a reason why fewer people in their early 20s own houses than in the past. But her speech, which attempted to dampen the notion of a housing affordability crisis, showed that there has been a significant increase in the level of first-home buyers who are receiving help for financing from family and friends \u2013 up from 10% of first-home buyers in 2000 to now just below 15%. Her speech, while providing some useful data, was also a bit odd. It rather beggars belief that someone from the RBA could talk about housing affordability and not even mention \u201cSydney\u201d. When the RBA began cutting rates in November 2011, the average new mortgage in New South Wales was $26,000 more than the average for the nation; now it is $67,000 larger. It says something about the complexity of the issue that even presenting national figures can present a massively distorted picture. The issue is even more complex once you also factor in the issue of renters. Ellis suggested the issue of renter security needed greater focus from policy makers given the data suggested that nearly 40% of renters were moving more than 3 times within a 13-year period. Such concerns certainly appear warranted on the back of a survey of renters also released this week by Choice. While the survey found around two-thirds of renters moved of their own accord it also found that 83% of renters in Australia have no fixed-term lease or are on a lease less than 12 months long and a stunning 20% of renters are on \u201ca month-to-month \u2018rolling\u2019 lease\u201d. Good luck trying to save for a deposit when you are worried that within the year you will have to look for another place to rent and then pay for moving. And this week, the CEO of the Commonwealth Bank, Ian Narev, also noted the complexity of the issue when he told ABC\u2019s Fran Kelly that rather than just rule in or out one measure, it is \u201cimportant we look at all supply side and demand side characteristics\u201d. Narev argued that we \u201cshould be taking an integrated look at housing supply and demand\u201d. While the supply side of housing is mostly a local and state issue, the federal government has a big say over demand \u2013 through it taxation arrangements that encourage property investment. Usually negative gearing is tarred as the reason for the bonfire that is housing affordability; but negative gearing is just the fuel \u2013 the 50% discount given for capital gains tax is the match. The discount was introduced by Howard and Costello in 1999, and quickly caused negative gearing to become one of the biggest strategies for reducing taxable income and equally quickly led to a surge in property investment and housing prices in the early-mid 2000s. The ALP went to the last election with a plan to reduce the discount to 25%. At the time Malcolm Turnbull and Scott Morrison lambasted the measure, but provided nothing in its place other than talk of working with the states to improve supply. And yet a surprise occurred this week when in response to signs that the government measures to cuts welfare spending lacked the required support to pass the Senate, Scott Morrison alluded to the fact that taxation revenue would instead have to rise. After years of ignoring the revenue side of the budget it appeared finally the government was embracing both sides of the budget. And even better it appeared it was also embracing both sides of the housing affordability issue. On Thursday the AFR\u2019s Phil Coorey wrote that the government was exploring reducing the capital gains tax concessions \u2013 chiefly, reducing the 50% discount. This shift was both welcome from a policy sense and also a political one. While the easy response would be that the government was doing a \u201cbackflip\u201d, it would also have given the government a perfect opportunity to make an intelligent argument on the back of well-developed policy. Advocacy, not slogans. But no. By early morning the finance minister Mathias Cormann had suggested the story was wrong and in question time the prime minister, while conceding the government had been modelling capital gains tax changes, repeatedly ruled out any changes \u2013 stating \u201cthe government has no intention or plan to change capital gains tax or negative gearing\u201d. Well it was nice while it lasted. And in some ways the government has progressed. Last December it took the government nearly two days to rule out an equally sensible and complex policy measure of an emissions intensity scheme after Josh Frydenberg suggested it would be examined in the government\u2019s climate change review. This Thursday it took less than the time between breakfast and lunch to knock the policy on its head. So much for respecting people\u2019s intelligence.",

      "bodyText": "Savers lost one of their last hopes for an interest rate rise when Bank of England rate-setter Kristin Forbes announced she would be heading back to her home in Massachusetts in June. Forbes, a US academic who craves a return to the \u201ceconomic normality\u201d of 4%-5% base rates, has consistently called for an increase, though never actually voted for one. After the summer, it could be that only Ian McCafferty is still inclined to raise rates among the Bank\u2019s nine monetary policy committee members. Mortgage-payers, on the other hand, will be throwing their hats in the air. And why not when the departure of Forbes, and the economic realities that always prevented her acting on instinct, means interest rates are going to stay low this year, next year and most likely for the rest of the decade? This prediction is not some finger-in-the-air exercise allied to Brexit gloomery, but an assessment of Britain\u2019s ingrained economic weakness, something Forbes understood and railed against. This fragility may not be obvious from the most recent economic figures. These show the UK outperformed the rest of the developed world last year: employment is near record highs and unemployment at an 11-year low. The concern \u2013 and anyone can see it in the Bank of England\u2019s own reports \u2013 lies beneath the veneer of impressive data Philip Hammond understandably flashes around to justify his steady-as-she-goes approach. That picture of boom-boom Britain is not entirely an illusion, but the figures don\u2019t really add up. Firstly, wage rises are stuck in first gear. The Bank of England expects pay packets to rise in response to increasing inflation over the next year. Yet the agents it employs around the country talked to 340 businesses and were told those employers planned to scale down increases from 2.7% to 2.2%. Several reasons were put forward for the reduction, most of them relating to increased labour costs from the new apprenticeship levy, due to take effect in April at a cost of \u00a33bn to businesses, and the rollout of the Nest occupational pension to small employers. The theory here is that while labour costs are rising, there is less money available to boost wages. Last week, the Office for National Statistics said annual wage rises had already started to dip, albeit slightly, from 2.7% to 2.6% in December. Exhibit two is the lack of business investment. A separate survey by Threadneedle Street found that ultra-low interest rates had failed to persuade companies to prioritise investment above handing out profits to shareholders. A third of companies complained that their banks were still tight with their money, and many others said the outlook was too uncertain. None of these companies are going to increase investment if the cost of borrowing rises, even if they were somehow to interpret higher rates as a sign that the economy was looking rosier. Then there is consumer spending. It is well known that the economy has expanded since 2010 largely due to a mania for mobile phones, cars, short hotel breaks and eating out. In the last year, this high street splurge was mostly due to households spending their wages, which increased by around 2.5% on average while inflation was virtually zero. Consumer credit is at levels not seen since the crash. Yet retail sales have declined for the last three months. In the last year households have also borrowed heavily and run down their savings. One industry shines out from the rest: figures from the Finance and Leasing Association show that British households borrowed a record \u00a331.6bn in 2016 to buy cars, up 12% on the year before. To give a measure of the way credit has become embedded in the purchase of a car, nine out of 10 private car buyers are now using personal contract plans that effectively provide a lease. These finance plans are all priced from the ultra-low interest rates and would become unattractive in a \u201cnormal\u201d interest-rate world. Moreover, savings have tumbled as a proportion of gross domestic product \u2013 and, worse, savers have been stealing not only from their deposit accounts but also from their pensions. George Osborne\u2019s reforms allowed people aged 55 or older to empty their pensions, turn long-term savings into cash and splash it about like champagne-spraying Formula One drivers. Around \u00a39bn has been extracted and spent in this way, giving the economy a boost akin to a 1p cut in the basic rate of income tax. By no means last on the list are the government and its finances, which are shot. The latest figures from the Institute for Fiscal Studies prepare the nation for at least another 10 years of austerity. There will be room for a little extra cash to be spent in this area or that. But with health costs rising, and tax receipts stagnant, there will be little room for manoeuvre. In short, there is very little left in the tank of the private sector or the government to boost a flagging economy, let alone overheat it. And the economy will need to be overheating, or look like it will, before the MPC even considers higher rates.",

      "bodyText": "Shopkeepers in Southwold are braced for a tough year. The picturesque seaside town in Suffolk is the area of Britain worst affected by the revaluation of business rates. On average, companies will see their tax bill increase by a staggering 177% from April \u2013 but for some the impact will be far worse. Clare Hart, who runs Chapmans newsagents on the high street, says she is nervous rather than angry at the increase: \u201cWe are scared and bewildered,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s so ludicrous, it\u2019s difficult to be cross.\u201d Chapmans will pay \u00a34,831 in rates from April, up from \u00a32,280 in this financial year. The tax bill will keep rising until it hits \u00a311,427 for the 2021-22 financial year: five times as high. Hart calculates that Chapmans will need to increase its sales by \u00a350,000 a year to cover the increase, but its average transaction is between just \u00a33 and \u00a33.50. \u201cWe can\u2019t put up prices because we won\u2019t be competitive,\u201d she says. \u201cWe are already competing with chains like Joules, who also sell sticks of rock and buckets and spades.\u201d Hart was one of a small collection of business leaders who met the local MP, the Conservative Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey, on Friday morning to discuss their fears. \u201cShe said she was going to help us,\u201d Hart says. Local businesses in Southwold, including Chapmans, have launched a campaign against the increase. Their stores are decorated with posters showing how a 177% rate rise would affect the price of the products they sell. Mills &amp; Sons, a family-run butcher, has put up a banner reading \u201cSOS \u2013 Save Our Shop\u201d. It includes a quote from Theresa May about family firms and small businesses being the \u201cbackbone of our country\u201d and that building an economy that \u201cworks for all\u201d means \u201cworking with and listening to small firms\u201d. The banner then adds: \u201cDear Mrs May \u2013 please listen to us urgently before we\u2019re gone.\u201d George Mills, who runs the butcher with his brother and father, says: \u201cIt is not dramatising it to say we would have concerns for the future of the business\u201d if the proposed rates increase happens. \u201cWe would certainly have to downscale.\u201d Mills &amp; Sons is set to see its business rate bill surge from \u00a37,000 a year currently to \u00a319,000. \u201cI know as a nation we are cash-strapped and no-one is flush,\u201d Mills adds. \u201cBut I am convinced nobody would want a high street that these measures will end up with. It will be a homogenised high street.\u201d Businesses in Southwold are facing this increase because the rental value of commercial property in the town has been increased dramatically in the latest revaluation by the Valuation Office Agency (VOA). It is an affluent town that attracts tourists during the summer and a number of nationwide brands have opened in the area in recent years. Business rates are calculated as a proportion of the rental value. The rental value is supposed to be measured every five years, but the previous revaluation was controversially delayed by the government in 2015 for two years, making the changes that will come into force from April more pronounced. The revaluation is not supposed to increase the tax take for the Treasury but adjust the burden of business rates so it reflects the shape of the economy. As a result, London will pay more under the revaluation while struggling high streets in northern England will pay less. David Gauke, chief secretary to the Treasury, defended the business rates system last week, accusing critics of the tax of \u201cscaremongering\u201d and claiming nearly three-quarters of businesses will see no change or a fall in what they pay. However, these comments have infuriated small businesses facing an increase even more. Tom Innes, who runs a wine shop in Monmouth, south Wales, is facing an increase of \u00a32,000 a year. \u201cYou could probably fit my shop sales area into Mr Gauke\u2019s sitting room. \u201cI think he sits in Westminster, does a lot of sums, and overall it is a zero sum. But everyone doesn\u2019t come out zero. It doesn\u2019t work out equal for people like me: I fall through the cracks. But he doesn\u2019t care about that, does he, because the sums work out.\u201d Gauke\u2019s comments were also contradicted by a survey by the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB), which found that business rates were the most important issue facing three-quarters of small firms in London, above economic uncertainty and hiring staff. The FSB is pushing for the threshold that businesses pay rates to be increased and for more helpful transitional measures to be introduced to stop the so-called cliff-edge that many firms are facing. At present, buildings with a rateable value of \u00a315,000 or less enjoy a discount on business rates or pay nothing at all. However, the revaluation has pushed many businesses \u2013 including Chapmans in Southwold \u2013 over the threshold. The government has capped the potential increases in business rates in the first year after the revaluation at 42%, but this is far higher than the 10-12% cap enjoyed in the past and there are also caps in place for those businesses that will benefit from a fall in their rates. \u201cThe significance of what is happening in April is now dawning,\u201d says Helen Dickinson, director general of the British Retail Consortium. \u201cThe basic problem is that the burden of the property tax is way higher than it is in other countries.\u201d Retailers, who pay the biggest share of business rates, have led calls for a complete overhaul of the tax, not least because high street stores are facing big bills that online retailers with vast warehouses do not have to pay. A report three years ago led by John Rogers, now the boss of Argos, and accountancy firm EY outlined four alternatives. These include measuring energy usage rather than property values; offering discounts for employing workers; linking business rates to corporation tax; and tweaking the existing system by introducing more frequent revaluations. Another idea that was mooted by Justin King, the former boss of Sainsbury\u2019s, was to replace business rates with a sales tax. Despite pledges by George Osborne, the former chancellor, to consider an overhaul of rates, no major changes have yet occurred. Osborne announced in the 2016 budget that from 2020 the annual inflation-based increase in business rates will be calculated using CPI rather than RPI. He also proposed more frequent revaluations, but the details of this are yet to be revealed. The problem for the critics of business rates is that the tax has become one of the Treasury\u2019s biggest and most reliable sources of income, bringing in nearly \u00a329bn last year. The tax is also at the centre of the government\u2019s drive to hand more powers to local authorities. By 2020 some councils will be able to keep 100% of the business rates raised in the local area, up from 50% at present. According to John Webber, head of ratings at property agent Colliers International, local authorities are increasing communications with the liaison officers at the VOA, because of concerns that successful appeals will lead to a black hole in their budgets. The VOA has a backlog of around 280,000 appeals. \u201cThe elephant in the room is localism and the devolution of business rates back to local authorities,\u201d he says. \u201cLocal authorities cannot afford to see big drops in rateable values. They are not quite pulling the strings, but they are in background telling the VOA they can\u2019t afford [successful appeals].\u201d Councillor Claire Kober, chair of the Local Government Association\u2019s resources board, adds: \u201cCouncils currently fund half of all business rates refunds on appeal and have been forced to divert \u00a32.5bn over the past five years to cover the risk of appeals and refunds. This means vital resources being diverted away from stretched local services, such as caring for the elderly, supporting businesses and boosting local growth.\u201d The call for changes to the business rates system is now starting to gain political momentum. Gareth Thomas, shadow minister for local government, and Jim McMahon, his fellow Labour and Co-operative MP, have tabled amendments to the local government finance bill calling for the government to consider offering discounts to hospitals \u2013 which face a \u00a3322m increase from April \u2013 and schools, and also for the business rates system to be fully reviewed before local authorities are allowed to keep 100% of the tax. Thomas says: \u201cBecause of the challenges that schools and hospitals are facing, this is a way of offering relief to vital services that are under heavy financial pressure. We want to test the minister\u2019s thinking on that.\u201d Thomas says he is also concerned about whether councils \u201cwill have enough in the pot\u201d after the changes to the business rates system. \u201cIt does raise a question about the long-term finances for local authorities,\u201d he says. \u201cI think there is a growing recognition that local authorities are under heavy pressure \u2013 the social care system is clearly in crisis. \u201cThere are a growing number of MPs who are concerned that if you devolve business rates and other responsibilities, will social care be properly funded after 2020 and will they be able to fund other services?\u201d The amendment is scheduled to be debated in parliament on Tuesday. Despite the government\u2019s protestations about scaremongering, the debate about business rates may only be getting started. Case studies: \u2018The system is totally broken, disproportionate and unfair\u2019 Jane Morrissey Rosehill nursery, Bolton Jane Morrissey said her business rates bill would go up to about \u00a320,000 a year, from \u00a316,000. \u201cI\u2019ve asked for assistance for the previous one and it\u2019s been declined by the council. I\u2019ve appealed each time it\u2019s gone up.\u201d She said the private nursery, which looks after 70 children on a part- or full-time basis, would have to get an extra eight children to cover the increase in business rates. But this would mean hiring another nursery worker, or three more if the extra children were babies. Her staff get paid at least \u00a315,600 a year, the living wage, but Rosehill prides itself on employing fully qualified staff, who earn graduate wages. The nursery employs 18 people. Morrissey said: \u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do.\u201d She said nurseries should be treated differently from shops and offices over business rates. \u201cThey don\u2019t rate us on education but on the income we could get if we rented our building out. We are looked at like retail, like offices. We are not in our own category.\u201d Nurseries also pay the full VAT rate of 20%, while schools only pay 5%. \u201cIt\u2019s not a level playing field.\u201d Morrissey added: \u201cIt\u2019s really difficult to balance the books at the moment. I think it will see me going out of business in the next few years.\u201d Nurseries cannot charge more than \u00a34 an hour for childcare, and the amount of free childcare available to parents will double to 30 hours from 15 hours a week from September. \u201cThe \u00a34 doesn\u2019t cover all the costs that are being imposed on us,\u201d the nursery manager said. Nurseries can increase top-up costs, such as meals and activities, but there is a limit \u2013 \u201cyou can\u2019t say it\u2019s \u00a320 per dinner,\u201d Morrissey said. \u201cIf a child wants to paint a picture, you can charge for the paint and the paper,\u201d she said \u2013 but she doesn\u2019t want to do that. She noted that two nurseries in Bolton had gone under in the last fortnight (one of them was not-for-profit and did not even have to pay business rates). Morrissey has spoken to her local MP about her concerns and will lobby the government this week, taking part in a Save the Children campaign to improve the quality of childcare. \u201cThey can\u2019t put us all out of business. We\u2019ve been set up to fail. For me, business rates are the biggest problem.\u201d Philip Davey Western Maritime Training, Plymouth Davey, whose Plymouth-based company trains people for the merchant navy, cruise ships and other vessels, said his annual business rates bill had nearly doubled. It has gone from \u00a34,400 in 2009 to \u00a38,400 this year. He said: \u201cThe system is totally broken, it is disproportionate and it is unfair.\u201d As a training company, Western Maritime needs a lot of space, and its rateable value has increased from \u00a370 per square metre to \u00a390. A nearby business that used less space but turned a higher profit was taxed less, he said. Davey suggested replacing business rates, a property tax, with a tax on gross profits. \u201cThose who make more, pay more \u2013 it\u2019s cost neutral to the government.\u201d He deplored that \u201cthe reduction of business rates has really only affected micro-businesses, rather than small businesses,\u201d adding: \u201cWe are training and developing people. The rise in business rates will affect our profitability, our investment and our ability to recruit staff \u2013 and this is an area that is going to be crucial after Brexit.\u201d Julia Kollewe",

We are not in our own category.\u201d</p> <p>Nurseries also pay the full VAT rate of 20%, while schools only pay 5%. \u201cIt\u2019s not a level playing field.\u201d Morrissey added: \u201cIt\u2019s really difficult to balance the books at the moment. I think it will see me going out of business in the next few years.\u201d</p> <p>Nurseries cannot charge more than \u00a34 an hour for childcare, and the amount of free childcare available to parents will double to 30 hours from 15 hours a week from September. \u201cThe \u00a34 doesn\u2019t cover all the costs that are being imposed on us,\u201d the nursery manager said.</p> <p>Nurseries can increase top-up costs, such as meals and activities, but there is a limit \u2013 \u201cyou can\u2019t say it\u2019s \u00a320 per dinner,\u201d Morrissey said. \u201cIf a child wants to paint a picture, you can charge for the paint and the paper,\u201d she said \u2013 but she doesn\u2019t want to do that.</p> <p>She noted that two nurseries in Bolton had gone under in the last fortnight (one of them was not-for-profit and did not even have to pay business rates).</p> <p>Morrissey has spoken to her local MP about her concerns and will lobby the government this week, taking part in a Save the Children campaign to improve the quality of childcare. \u201cThey can\u2019t put us all out of business. We\u2019ve been set up to fail. For me, business rates are the biggest problem.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Philip Davey</strong><br><em>Western Maritime Training, Plymouth</em><br>Davey, whose Plymouth-based company trains people for the merchant navy, cruise ships and other vessels, said his annual business rates bill had nearly doubled. It has gone from \u00a34,400 in 2009 to \u00a38,400 this year. He said: \u201cThe system is totally broken, it is disproportionate and it is unfair.\u201d As a training company, Western Maritime needs a lot of space, and its rateable value has increased from \u00a370 per square metre to \u00a390. A nearby business that used less space but turned a higher profit was taxed less, he said.</p> <p>Davey suggested replacing business rates, a property tax, with a tax on gross profits. \u201cThose who make more, pay more \u2013 it\u2019s cost neutral to the government.\u201d</p> <p>He deplored that \u201cthe reduction of business rates has really only affected micro-businesses, rather than small businesses,\u201d adding: \u201cWe are training and developing people. The rise in business rates will affect our profitability, our investment and our ability to recruit staff \u2013 and this is an area that is going to be crucial after Brexit.\u201d<br><strong>Julia Kollewe</strong></p>",

      "bodyText": "Barely seven weeks have passed since Liam Coleman took charge of the Co-operative Bank \u2013 but last week he hoisted a for-sale sign. The career banker will be hoping prospective buyers focus on what he insists is a strong, growing high street operation \u2013 rather than one that is on track to report its fifth consecutive annual loss. The Co-op Bank has racked up losses of \u00a32.1bn since 2011 and has been told to raise more capital by the Bank of England. Its response has been to look for a buyer but that is where the problems start. A new owner may not have the same ethical approach to business \u2013 indeed, it could even be forced to stop using the Co-op brand \u2013 but the bank has 4 million customers and 85% of them, according to the Co-op\u2019s own research, joined the bank precisely because of its ethical stance. The Co-op Bank\u2019s ethical credentials, which include not doing business with companies that breach human rights or are involved in animal testing, are \u201ca bedrock and central strand to many of the relationships we have with our retail customers,\u201d said Coleman. Coleman is looking for a buyer, and considering other options, to shore up the ruinous financial position created by the disastrous deal between the Co-op and Britannia building society eight years ago. At that time, the talk was of the creation of a mutual behemoth, born out of the ashes of the financial crisis. But within four years it had all come tumbling down \u2013 after an audacious and aborted to attempt to grow even bigger by buying what is now known as TSB. In 2013, a \u00a31.5bn hole in the bank\u2019s finances was uncovered. Until then, wholly owned by the Co-operative Group, the UK\u2019s biggest mutual which runs grocery chains and funeral parlours, it was forced to ced control to hedge funds, and hand over 80% of the bank, to survive. A vivid 152-page account into what went wrong at the Co-op by former top civil servant Sir Christopher Kelly concluded it was brought down by poor management, bad lending, a flawed culture and an overambitious drive for growth. Its former chief executive, Barry Tootell, has been banned from ever holding a senior position in banking again and former chairman Paul Flowers was fined for possessing cocaine, crystal meth and ketamine and subsequently dismissed as a minister by the Methodist church. Coleman, who joined after spells at RBS and Nationwide and was part of the 2013 turnaround team, says the bank is now a very different organisation to the one rescued by hedge funds. Its board has been revamped, it has pared back riskier lending and its assets have been scaled down from \u00a343bn to \u00a328bn. A turnaround programme has led to the workforce being more than halved to 4,000 and nearly 200 branches have been shut down, leaving only 105. Some 700,000 customers have also departed \u2013 although these include many customers who regularly move their cash between the best deals and were lured in by high-paying savings products that no longer exist. Current account holders have only slipped from 1.5 million to 1.4 million, but the number of mortgage customers has increased to 225,000 from 175,000. In a week when Royal Bank of Scotland will reveal it has now racked up \u00a355bn of losses since its 2008 bailout, the losses at the Co-op may appear comparatively small. But in the context of the once mutually owned bank, they are enormous: more than double the profits made since the start of the millennium. Other progress has been made: an overhaul of the Co-op\u2019s famously rickety IT systems was completed last Monday and discussions over the pension fund are still under way. But the turnaround plan has been knocked off course by the damage done to profitability by low interest rates, which no one expected to have remained so low for so long when the plan was put in place three years ago. Hence the need to find more cash and the quest for a buyer. The only other alternative may be to ask existing shareholders (the hedge funds and the Co-op group) to put up more cash. The Co-op Group \u2013 which has already written down the value of its 20% stake from \u00a3333m stake to \u00a3140m \u2013 was quick to deliver its verdict on that idea, saying it was \u201csupportive of the plan to find the bank a new home\u201d. Equally, the hedge funds are unlikely to want to have to dig any deeper. \u201cThe bank\u2019s probably been looking for a buyer ever since the Co-op Group reduced its ownership. Hedge funds aren\u2019t in there for the long-term,\u201d said Pete Hahn, dean at the London Institute of Banking &amp; Finance. The arrival of those hedge funds \u2013 and the reputation of hedge-fund investors \u2013 meant that the Co-op Bank\u2019s ethical credentials, which had pulled in so many customers since they were introduced in 1992, were written into its articles of association. \u201cPutting them in the documents, they are clearer than they\u2019ve ever been,\u201d said Coleman. The business secretary Greg Clark and the Financial Conduct Authority can ban any buyer from using the Co-op name if it is regarded as misleading to the public. That is not to say the bank\u2019s approach to ethics has not been questioned. Coleman\u2019s predecessor, Niall Booker, was criticised for his multimillion-pound pay deals; Coleman\u2019s is yet to be disclosed. The bank has also been hit by a \u00a3660m bill to compensate customers for mis-selling payment protection insurance. \u201cIt\u2019s taken some big charges on PPI,\u201d said Hahn. \u201cIt may not lend money to defence companies, but how ethical was it really? It is still a bank.\u201d Coleman won\u2019t say how much cash the bank needs to find. But analysts at JP Morgan reckon it is about \u00a3550m. They are sceptical that a takeover is possible and think bondholders \u2013 as was the case in 2013 \u2013 may eventually have to pay up to cover the shortfall. \u201cThere are very few options left,\u201d they said. \u201cWe think bondholders may have to participate in the recapitalisation of the troubled lender.\u201d Tomas Kinmonth, fixed-income analyst at ABN Amro, thinks the bank is unlikely to be taken over in its entirety. \u201cIt is expensive to take over such a small bank,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is very little value in taking over the infrastructure and staff.\u201d It is more likely, he says, that the current accounts and mortgage book will be sold off separately. The Co-op brand might go with the current accounts, but could equally be sold to another buyer who pledges to retain the ethical stance. Whatever the outcome, though, it is very different to 2012 when, together with the TSB branches, the Co-op was expected to create a 1,000-strong high street force to take on the big four of Lloyds Banking Group, HSBC, Barclays and RBS.",

A Downing Street spokesman said: \u201cWe can confirm we have received a meeting request. The meeting will take place, in principle, subject to diary availability.\u201d The Unite general secretary, Len McCluskey, will meet Tavares next week in the latest in a series of talks he has held to help avoid any job losses. He said: \u201cI am pleased that Carlos Tavares has responded speedily and positively to my request for a meeting to discuss Peugeot\u2019s intentions towards our Vauxhall plants. \u201cI will be using this meeting to press the case for the UK\u2019s world class facilities and workforce, and ensuring that Mr Tavares and the PSA Group understand fully that Luton, Toddington and Ellesmere Port, and thousands of dedicated UK workers, deserve a strong backer and a positive future.\u201d Vauxhall\u2019s 35,000-strong UK workforce includes 23,000 in its retail network, 300 at a customer contact centre in Luton and 7,000 in its supply chain alongside the 4,500 employed at factories at Ellesmere Port in Cheshire and Luton in Bedfordshire. PSA said it was engaged in a \u201cconstructive dialogue\u201d with all parties involved in the bid for GM\u2019s European division. A spokesman said: \u201cOur intention is to establish the same maturity in our exchanges in France, Germany and the UK. This is why Carlos Tavares has asked to meet Theresa May as was done with German authorities. \u201cIn the spirit of co-construction that is driving the PSA Group on a daily basis with its own trade union representatives in France, the same approach is obviously being taken to contact the trade union organisations in Germany and the UK.\u201d The business secretary, Greg Clark, travelled to Paris on Thursday to meet his French counterpart, Christophe Sirugue, and board members of PSA. After the GM talks, Clark said he \u201cemphasised the importance and successful presence of Vauxhall in the UK and welcomed GM\u2019s recognition of the excellent and committed workforce\u201d at Ellesmere Port and Luton. \u201cThere is some way to go in discussions between GM and PSA, but I was reassured by GM\u2019s intention, communicated to me, to build on the success of these operations rather than rationalise them,\u201d he said. The tie-up would involve GM leaving Europe, and PSA becoming the second-largest European carmaker with a 16% market share. PSA, which owns the Citro\u00ebn and Peugeot brands, formed an alliance with GM in 2012 in an attempt to streamline production by combining purchasing power and larger scale. GM said last year it had to raise UK car prices by 2.5% after the plunge in the value of the pound after the EU referendum result caused the British car industry to hit a \u201cspeed bump\u201d. Announcing its full-year results last week, the Detroit-based company said GM Europe had narrowed losses to $257m (\u00a3206m) in the year to the end of December, from a loss of $813m the year before.",

This may not sound like your typical shopping basket from Iceland, but the UK\u2019s homegrown cut-price chain is experiencing a revival in sales after taking a tip from Germany\u2019s Aldi and Lidl by offering luxury foods that broaden its appeal. After about two years \u201cin the wilderness\u201d, in the words of founder Malcolm Walker, during which sales and profits dipped, Iceland is celebrating its 47th year in business with a surprise revival. Iceland has just been named as the UK\u2019s best online supermarket by 7,000 shoppers polled by consumer group Which? for the second year running. They also rated its stores ahead of much larger chains Sainsbury\u2019s, Tesco and Asda. The chain increased sales by 8.6% in the three months to the end of January, taking its market share to 2.3%, the highest level since 2001, according to market analysts Kantar Worldpanel. Walker says sales at established stores are rising again after investment in better quality products and some smart advertising campaigns, which are finally helping to shrug off Iceland\u2019s links to Kerry Katona and doner kebab pizzas. \u201cMany companies, if they see a drop in profits, cut costs. We did the opposite and spent money,\u201d says Walker. Backing from Brait, the investment vehicle of acquisitive South African entrepreneur Christo Wiese, which upped its stake in Iceland to 57% from about 20% in late 2015, has helped support the revival. Walker says he brought in new management across all areas of the business, including former Morrisons and Waitrose head chef Neil Nugent who he set up as head of product development with a \u00a33m development kitchen. \u201cIt was a bit of a Portakabin before,\u201d says Walker. Ideas have also been imported from The Food Warehouse, a sister chain run by Walker\u2019s son Richard, which is also providing another avenue of growth. It currently has 34 stores, which are larger than Iceland shops and sit on retail parks rather than high streets. There are plans for between 25 and 30 more over the next few years. In Iceland, you can still buy shepherds pie, a cheesy bean and sausage stew or McCain oven chips for \u00a31. But there are also frozen scallops, whole Dover Sole and tuna steaks, as well as Slimming World ready meals, Pizza Express ice-cream and pizzas, and frozen berries for juicing. The chain now has 50 luxury food lines compared with a handful a year ago. The change in menu is tempting in more shoppers while existing customers are spending more. What\u2019s more, nearly 19% of the chain\u2019s punters now hail from the middle class AB demographic, according to Kantar Worldpanel, compared with 16.1% in 2015. Shoppers are buying more fresh and chilled foods, as well as frozen fish and ready meals. Bryan Roberts, a retail analyst at TCC Global, says Iceland has found a way to fight back against stiff competition by Aldi, Lidl and the bigger supermarkets, which had all expanded their ranges of frozen foods. \u201cHistorically Iceland has failed to communicate its benefits, using uninspiring celebrities. Arguably they were just preaching to the converted. But its recent advertising has been more aspirational and has demonstrated its often unacknowledged breadth of range in fresh and ambient as well as frozen foods,\u201d Roberts says. Walker also admits Iceland\u2019s website was \u201ca bit Fisher-Price\u201d, or basic, when it first launched three years ago, but online sales are now increasing by as much as 50% year on year. That\u2019s partly thanks to low delivery charges, but those polled by Which? also praised the quality of its fresh products and its friendly, helpful drivers. The next stage of Iceland\u2019s development can be found in Clapham, a well-to-do suburb of south London, where Iceland has been experimenting with a hipsterish store designed to attract shoppers from the Little Waitrose next door. There are smart vertical freezers with sloped doors which show off products more effectively, double the amount of fresh fruit and veg moved to the front of the store and a much bigger wine and beer section. With lots of colourful pictures of food on walls and pillars, it feels more like a small supermarket than a typical Iceland, which can often seem bleak and dated. Regular shoppers filling their baskets on Friday morning say they find it much easier to move around and spot what they want. One says she\u2019s not yet been tempted by the octopus or clams but adds: \u201cOoh, it\u2019s not too posh for me.\u201d Sales have doubled since the Clapham store\u2019s refit in October, while only about 10% of the range is different to a regular Iceland, mostly imported from Food Warehouse. The group is now planning six more makeovers similar to Clapham elsewhere in London, including stores in Fulham, Worcester Park, Streatham and East Finchley, and will be roadtesting most of the elements at a refit of its Chester store, close to Iceland\u2019s head office, from next week. About 50 more of Iceland\u2019s 882 UK stores are already lined up for a makeover within the next year if the first six perform well. Walker says: \u201cThe middle classes wouldn\u2019t have been seen dead in [the Clapham store] before but they\u2019ve said \u2018this looks quite smart\u2019 and when they go in they\u2019re blown away by the products and prices.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The truth is stranger than fiction. Rising out of the chaos of the Brexit vote stand two opposing visions of Britain\u2019s future. There is Britain as the 19th-century free-trade, low-tax warrior, the world\u2019s banker, insurer, and lawyer. Facts get in the way of visions. In the 19th-century free trade was about strong countries undermining the sovereignty of others. Not the best model for Britain today. Britannia no longer has the world\u2019s most powerful navy to blockade Latin American ports until the locals pay City of London bondholders or push opium onto the Chinese. Opposite this free trade myth is ... nothing. \u201cRemainers\u201d are so pinning their hopes on the cavalry arriving at the last minute to rescue them that they have invested little thought on a post-Brexit future. There is a progressive alternative that is not all aspiration. There are practical policy measures, for instance, that would help to transform our financial sector into one focused on financing the long-term investments necessary to build an economically efficient and socially just alternative to Victoriana. One of these is a regulatory change made possible by Brexit. Another is the modernisation of an old English tax on the churning of assets. When our entrepreneurs look at a car manufacturer or clothes chain, they see a real estate or pension play. Our business elites live for the clever flip that allows them to buy the superyacht. A certain amount of trading and speculation in the background is useful. It helps us to value things. But when the background becomes the foreground we end up with illusions of value. Our financial markets are bigger in turnover than before, but under stress, they are proving thinner and more vulnerable to flash crashes. Today\u2019s economic model mirrors the banking model. Bankers view loans as opportunities to earn fees for originating, securitising, trading, settling and clearing. They have shifted the risk of holding the loan to others. They boast that accelerating the speed through which securities circulate reduces costs to consumers and is a measure of their immense contribution to the economy which, they argue, must be preserved post-Brexit, at all costs. But when Thomas Philippon added up the fees paid by the non-financial sector to the financial sector, he found that at 2.0% of finance raised, costs had in recent decades returned to where they were in 1880. All of the efficiency gains since the steam age, as a result of new technologies, innovation and globalisation have recently been captured by those who run the industry and not shared with consumers. It is one of the largest contributors to worsening income inequality over the past 30 years. Equally important, when the financial sector makes more money from churning than investing, they will do less investing, contributing to a secular stagnation. The current economic and banking model is vulnerable to two policy changes. We can amend European regulation (Solvency II) that through capital adequacy requirements not commensurate with the risks faced by long-term savers, incentivises them to invest in short-term government bonds and not make long-term investments. We can modernise and extend the UK\u2019s existing tax on churning \u2013 the stamp tax on share transactions. The industry repeats the false idea that the tax doesn\u2019t work so many times that people have stopped seeing what is in front of them. This tax currently raises \u00a33bn a year primarily from foreign owners of UK shares who have not found a way of avoiding it after 322 years of its existence. According to an IMF report, similar taxes collect billions or more from 30 countries. This is not a tax on where a trade takes place, as an unsuccessful Swedish tax in the 1980s, but on the transfer of the ownership of the security. New tax information agreements and disclosure requirements on beneficial ownership following the global financial crisis make it possible to extend this tax for the first time to derivatives and other securities without fear of relocation of trades. Instead, the UK finance industry has chipped away at this tax over the years to the point where the government loses \u00a31bn a year of potential revenues through exemptions that cover high-frequency traders and hedge funds. In a new Intelligence Capital Paper, I set out the case for extensions and the closing of loopholes that would raise \u00a325bn over the life of a parliament. The money will come in handy. The big prize is the transformation of the economy to where investing trumps trading and finance is the servant of industry, not its master. Avinash Persaud is chairman of Intelligence Capital",

      "body": "<p>The truth is stranger than fiction. Rising out of the chaos of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">the Brexit vote </a>stand two opposing visions of Britain\u2019s future. There is Britain as the 19th-century free-trade, low-tax warrior, the world\u2019s banker, insurer, and lawyer. </p> <p>Facts get in the way of visions. In the 19th-century free trade was about strong countries undermining the sovereignty of others. Not the best model for Britain today. Britannia no longer has the world\u2019s most powerful navy to blockade Latin American ports until the locals pay City of London bondholders or push opium onto the Chinese.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/29/brexit-banks-britain-financial-crisis\">Brexit has allowed the banks to get off Britain's naughty step</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Opposite this free trade myth is ... nothing. \u201cRemainers\u201d are so pinning their hopes on the cavalry arriving at the last minute to rescue them that they have invested little thought on a post-Brexit future. </p> <p>There is a progressive alternative that is not all aspiration. There are practical policy measures, for instance, that would help to transform our financial sector into one focused on financing the long-term investments necessary to build an economically efficient and socially just alternative to Victoriana. One of these is a regulatory change made possible by Brexit. Another is the modernisation of an old English tax on the churning of assets. </p> <p>When our entrepreneurs look at a car manufacturer or clothes chain, they see a real estate or pension play. Our business elites live for the clever flip that allows them to buy the superyacht. A certain amount of trading and speculation in the background is useful. It helps us to value things. But when the background becomes the foreground we end up with illusions of value. Our financial markets are bigger in turnover than before, but under stress, they are proving thinner and more vulnerable to flash crashes. </p> <p>Today\u2019s economic model mirrors the banking model. Bankers view loans as opportunities to earn fees for originating, securitising, trading, settling and clearing. They have shifted the risk of holding the loan to others. They boast that accelerating the speed through which securities circulate reduces costs to consumers and is a measure of their immense contribution to the economy which, they argue, must be preserved post-Brexit, at all costs. But when Thomas Philippon added up the fees paid by the non-financial sector to the financial sector, he found that at 2.0% of finance raised, costs had in recent decades returned to where they were in 1880. </p> <p>All of the efficiency gains since the steam age, as a result of new technologies, innovation and globalisation have recently been captured by those who run the industry and not shared with consumers. It is one of the largest contributors to worsening income inequality over the past 30 years. Equally important, when the financial sector makes more money from churning than investing, they will do less investing, contributing to a secular stagnation. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/06/kenneth-rogoff-ftt-robin-hood-tax-overselling\">The overselling of financial transaction taxes</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The current economic and banking model is vulnerable to two policy changes. We can amend European regulation (Solvency II) that through capital adequacy requirements not commensurate with the risks faced by long-term savers, incentivises them to invest in short-term government bonds and not make long-term investments. We can modernise and extend the UK\u2019s existing tax on churning \u2013 the stamp tax on share transactions. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/mar/13/dont-believe-bankers-robin-hood-tax\">The industry repeats the false idea that the tax doesn\u2019t work so many times that people have stopped seeing what is in front of them. </a>This tax currently raises \u00a33bn a year primarily from foreign owners of UK shares who have not found a way of avoiding it after 322 years of its existence. According to an IMF report, similar taxes collect billions or more from 30 countries. </p> <p> This is not a tax on where a trade takes place, as an unsuccessful Swedish tax in the 1980s, but on the transfer of the ownership of the security. New tax information agreements and disclosure requirements on beneficial ownership following the global financial crisis make it possible to extend this tax for the first time to derivatives and other securities without fear of relocation of trades. Instead, the UK finance industry has chipped away at this tax over the years to the point where the government loses \u00a31bn a year of potential revenues through exemptions that cover high-frequency traders and hedge funds. In <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers2.cfm?abstract_id=2908464\">a new Intelligence Capital Paper</a>, I set out the case for extensions and the closing of loopholes that would raise \u00a325bn over the life of a parliament. The money will come in handy. The big prize is the transformation of the economy to where investing trumps trading and finance is the servant of industry, not its master. </p> <p><em>Avinash Persaud is chairman of Intelligence Capital </em></p>",
