      "bodyText": "The Bank of England is expected to signal this week that interest rates will remain low for several years to spur the economy, despite growing evidence that the recovery is gathering pace. At a meeting on Wednesday, the central bank's new governor, Mark Carney, will outline plans to boost lending to Britain's business community with an assurance that several hurdles will need to be overcome before base rates can rise from the current 0.5%. The use of \"forward guidance\" to give the international markets and consumers a steer on when rates might rise has been adopted by the US Federal Reserve and is known to be on Carney's list of initiatives for the Bank of England. Knowing inflation is predicted to fall over the next two years and that growth is accelerating, Carney is likely to argue that the recovery remains fragile and could easily blow off course without low rates and \u00a3375bn of lending to financial institutions through Threadneedle Street's quantitative easing scheme. His supporters point out that the construction and manufacturing sectors, which have shown renewed signs of life in recent surveys, remain well below their peak levels of activity while the services sector, which has led the recovery, is dependent on consumer spending. The CBI on Sunday warned that growth faced \"significant risks\"; there was a backdrop of falling new orders for small- to medium-sized manufacturers, \"disappointing\" expectations. The business lobby group said domestic orders were static and exports had fallen for a fifth consecutive quarter, with output having a slight fall. Prospects for the next three months were said to be slightly better, with output expected to stabilise and new orders contracting at a slower pace. Investment plans for the coming year were \"broadly unchanged\", its survey of 390 manufacturers showed. The EEF, the manufacturers' lobby group, gave its own health warning, after it upgraded its growth forecast to 1.1% this year, up from its previous prediction of 0.9%, following a rise in industrial orders over recent months. It said the economy needed a business investment boost to surpass the 2.5% long-run average many economists thought critical to lowering unemployment. Lee Hopley, chief economist at the EEF, said: \"Across the whole economy business investment is 34% lower today than at the peak in 2008. We think the UK has reached rock bottom and the only way is up.\" She added that the pace of job losses in the sector was expected to continue, albeit more modestly this year and in 2014, while the eurozone posed less of a risk to the UK's growth prospects. A survey across all sectors of the economy for the ICAEW, the accountancy body, found that business confidence was at a three-year high in the last three months and a majority of firms expected sales and staff numbers to grow. ICAEW's chief executive, Michael Izza, said: \"Confidence is at a high level, and with the economy expected to grow by 1.0% this quarter, businesses need to make the most of the environment to ensure the recovery is consolidated.\" But he supported the EEF's view that long-term investments in plant, machinery and premises, were being delayed while the political and economic environments remained uncertain. \"Currently, decisions such as where to invest are being made on a short-term basis, which explains why the strong figures for this quarter are being led by improvements in the housing sector and increased consumption by households.\" The US, which accounts for around a quarter of UK exports has provided an important outlet for British goods over the last year and until recently emerging markets such as China have bought British machine tools and cars in greater numbers. Hopes that exports will continue to rise remain a dominant feature of business surveys, but analysts have warned that a slowdown in China while it deals with a property loan bubble and overcapacity in several key industries, could hit exports in the second half of the year. The eurozone, which accounts for 40% of UK trade, is likely to recover after an 18-month recession, though at a slow rate and with the possibility of further political crises acting as a drag on confidence. Anna Leach, the CBI's head of economic analysis, said: \"Firms expect demand to improve both at home and abroad, and production to stabilise over the next three months. But manufacturers remain concerned about the impact of political and economic conditions overseas on external demand, reflecting ongoing uncertainty about the global economic outlook.\"",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "It is a pity Karl Marx was not around last week to comment on the news that 90% of the workers at Sports Direct are on zero-hours contracts. The author of the Communist Manifesto would also have had plenty to say about the news that the official estimates of those working in this form of casualised labour had shot up by 25%. It would have amused him to hear that even Buckingham Palace \u2013 the very symbol of the ruling class \u2013 had got in on the act. It is safe to say Marx would have cavilled with those who see zero-hour contracts as an expression of Britain's economic strength, a demonstration of flexible labour markets in action. He would have thought \"reserve army of labour\" a better description of conditions in which workers were expected to be permanently on call for an employer. The Office for National Statistics said last week that 250,000 people were now on zero-hours contracts \u2013 a 25% increase on its previous estimates but still small in relation to the 30 million people employed in the UK. The estimate is, however, disputed by some labour market experts who point out that more than 300,000 care workers are on such contracts. What is certain is that the total is on a steep upward curve; it may be as high as one million and growing. Bodies representing employers say zero-hours contracts should be welcomed since without them unemployment would be even higher. Better, they say, that people should be working 20 hours one week and no hours at all the next rather than be on the dole. Seen in this light, Vince Cable \u2013 who is conducting a review of the contracts \u2013 should be thinking of further deregulation of the labour market rather than contemplating measures that might reduce this \"flexibility\". He could, for instance, repeal the 1874 Factory Act that banned children under 10 from working in a manufacturing plant. He could rethink the 1847 10-hour Act that said children should not work for more than 10 hours a day. He could be really bold and say that Parliament erred in 1841 when it voted in favour of the Mines Act that prevented a child under 10 from working underground in a pit. Because, let's face it, all this legislation represented regulation of the labour market that made it less \"flexible\". It's only fair to say that some employees are content to be on zero-hours contracts. Some students, for example, want to combine work with study and are willing to turn up when summoned. That's also true of older workers topping up their pensions with a bit of irregular, part-time work. That said, there is an early 19th-century feel to zero-hours contracts. It is as though Britain has gone back to the future, returned to an age where the employer had the whip hand and where the rights that workers enjoyed under the feudal system had been removed. Research by the Resolution Foundation thinktank shows that those on zero-hours contracts earn less than those on staff or on fixed-hours contracts. They have no rights to sick pay. Holiday pay is often refused. And there is plenty of anecdotal evidence to show that if they turn down work when it is offered \u2013 even if it is to take a child for a medical appointment \u2013 they will be pigeon-holed as not suitably \"flexible\". The choice to refuse work is, in reality, no such thing. These were the sorts of labour market practices that gave rise to trade unions in the first place. Back then they had a name: exploitation. Many big employers are wary of zero-hours contracts and there are sound economics reasons for their refusal to do so. The first is the risk of reputational damage. There have been plenty of examples in recent years of firms that have suffered from a consumer backlash against business practices deemed to be unethical or anti-social, and in an age when social media campaigns go viral the damage can be instant and severe. The second is that in an economy increasingly dominated by the service sector, many firms want their employees to be loyal, motivated and customer-friendly. They believe that the chances of recruiting and retaining the best staff improve when employees are paid higher wages and have greater job security. Public sector employers, in particular, should be aware of the risks. The growing use of such contracts in care homes is the consequence of an ageing population and the drive to cut costs. This is a combustible mixture, and it doesn't take much imagination to envisage the likely outcome: more cases of neglect and cruelty. Finally, there are the big picture consequences of casualised labour. For the individual firm, cutting costs through zero-hours contracts may make perfect sense. Firms only employ labour when they need it, so that the cost of employing an additional worker is equivalent to the extra output produced. Lower wages equals higher profit, leading eventually to higher investment and an increase in employment. The issue is whether this equation works at an economy-wide level, the Keynesian doctrine is that driving down wages leads either to falling aggregate demand (leading to lower profits and pressure for even lower wages), a higher government bill for tax credits or increased individual debt. In the 30 years that followed the second world war, the social democratic model held sway. It was a time when governments followed full-employment strategies, trade unions were strong, and when governments believed that rising real wages and job security were good for capitalism. The mood changed in the mid-1970s, and in the subsequent decade high levels of unemployment, curbs on trade unions, deregulation and globalisation combined to shift the balance of power in favour of employers. So what happens now? In one sense, a controlled experiment is under way. If the free marketeers are right, then companies such as Sports Direct will thrive while Tesco will not. Similarly, those countries that have \"flexible\" labour markets such as the UK will do better than those countries that cling on to social democratic values. Marx would have seen zero-hours contracts as the continuation of a long historical trend, stretching back to the mid-1960s when the profitability of western manufacturing firms started to fall. From that moment, he would say, the search was on for measures to boost profits, and this has manifested itself in a number of ways: by direct attacks on organised labour; by the increased financialisation of the economy; by the search for cheap raw materials whatever the environmental cost; and by asset bubbles. Accordingly, zero-hours contracts are the response to tougher conditions facing firms as a result of the financial crisis. Reversing that trend will require more than legislation: it will mean tackling one of the root causes of that crisis: the imbalance of power in the labour market.",

HSBC: not so local any more The problem of not being able to get out of Iraq is often a tricky one, but rarely has the cry been made in relation to the banking sector. Yet HSBC is struggling to do just that, as attempts to exit its Iraqi operations have seen two proposals to sell its stake in Dar Es Salaam Investment Bank rejected by the country's regulator. We might hear a bit more about those withdrawal plans this week when HSBC adds to a busy fortnight for the sector with its interim profits \u2013 which are expected to have grown by 13% to around \u00a39bn, to an extent buoyed by retreats from other territories. The mass-exodus strategy was devised by chief executive Stuart Gulliver, having reversed HSBC's expansion in US consumer banking and closed or sold more than 50 businesses worldwide since he took the top job in 2011. The US campaign was, of course, particularly painful \u2013 the bank's 2003 purchase of sub-prime lender Household left it setting aside more than $65bn for dodgy loans. Still, the result is clear: under Gulliver, HSBC's is no longer the world's local bank.
