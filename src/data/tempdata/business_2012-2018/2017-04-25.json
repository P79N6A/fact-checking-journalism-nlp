      "bodyText": "The federal government could collect billions more in royalties and tax revenue if it changed the rules on debt loading and adopted alternative royalty schemes in dealing with oil and gas giants, new modelling shows. Our modelling, funded by lobby group GetUp, found that over the four-year period from 2012 to 2015, Chevron\u2019s average effective interest rate was 6.4%. However, it has been steadily reducing from 7.8% in 2012 to 5.7% in 2015. We estimated that if Australia adopted a similar approach to Hong Kong to eliminate debt loading abuse, US oil and gas giant Chevron would have been denied $6.27bn in interest deductions, potentially increasing tax revenues by $1.89bn over the four-year period (2012-15). The issue of debt loading abuse was highlighted last week when the full bench of the federal court dismissed unanimously Chevron\u2019s appeal against the Australian Taxation Office (ATO), ordering the company to pay more than $300m. Chevron Australia was using debt loading, where, compared its equity, it borrowed a large amount of debt at a high interest rate from its US subsidiary (which borrows at much lower rates). It did this in order to shift profits from high to low tax jurisdictions. Based on Australia\u2019s existing \u201cthin capitalisation\u201d rules, there is a maximum allowable debt that interest deductions can be claimed on, in a company\u2019s tax return. Companies can exceed this debt but the interest charges must be at \u201carm\u2019s length\u201d \u2013 at commercial rates. Chevron\u2019s size and financial strength allow it to negotiate very competitive (low) rates on its external borrowings and this was the main issue in the federal court case. As the court has now ruled on what constitutes a reasonable interest rate for inter-company loans, this benchmark will likely be adopted by the ATO. It can now approach and enforce this benchmark in similar disputes with confidence that companies engaged in debt loading will want to settle rather than engage in a costly court battle. What the government could save from addressing debt loading Chevron\u2019s tax avoidance measures meant the interest rate, adjusted for maximum allowable debt, varied only slightly from their effective rate. Our modelling showed that if the ATO had applied the thin capitalisation rules to Chevron\u2019s accounts each year over the four-year period, it would\u2019ve reduced Chevron\u2019s interest deduction by $461m and potentially generate an additional tax liability of A$138m. We modelled a scenario where Chevron Australia\u2019s interest deductions were limited to the group\u2019s external interest rate, applied to its level of debt. This would have reduced in the interest deduction by $4.8bn over the four year period, potentially generating $1.4bn in additional tax revenue. We also worked out what would happen if Australia applied the debt loading rules Hong Kong does currently. Hong Kong disallows all deductions for related-party interest payments, making abuse of the system difficult. According to the latest ATO submission to the Senate tax inquiry, investment in the extraction of Australian oil and gas is almost entirely in the form of related-party loans. Chevron Australia\u2019s debt is entirely made up of related-party loans. If the Hong Kong solution was operating in Australia, we found that Chevron would have been denied $6.275bn in interest deductions, potentially increasing tax revenues by $1.89bn over the four-year period. We also looked at ExxonMobil Australia, which also has high amounts of related-party debt (98.5%), and the Hong Kong solution would have denied ExxonMobil $2.7bn in interest deductions, potentially increasing tax revenue by more than A$800m for the same period. Changing the PRRT for more revenue Our report also includes an analysis of the potential for additional revenue from replacing the petroleum resource rent tax (PRRT) with resource rent systems used in the US and Canada. Oil and gas sales have increased from an average of $5.96bn a year between 1988 and 1991, to an annual average of $33.3bn between 2012 and 2015, indicating the huge growth in this sector. We modelled what would happen if the US and the Alberta, Canada, royalty schemes were applied to Australian production volumes and realised prices, to compare returns to those achieved by the PRRT. The US royalty scheme charges a flat percentage royalty on production volumes, priced at the well head. The royalty rate was progressively increased in the US from 12.5% to 18.75% between 2006 and 2008. Based on the data from Australian production volumes and realised sales prices, the US royalty scheme could have potentially raised an additional $5.9bn in revenue for Australia since 1988, or $212m a year. However, over the period from 2010 to 2015, the additional revenues would have been almost $2.5bn a year. This is because of both the decline in the PRRT revenues, relative to price and volumes, and the increase in the royalty rate in the US. However, while the US scheme would raise more than the PRRT, the Alberta royalty scheme would raise substantially more revenue than both of these schemes. The Alberta scheme is progressive in nature, meaning the royalty rate increases with the realised price, similar to income levels and personal income tax rates. The Alberta scheme has been amended many times and the current scheme only started in January 2017, so the full effects of this scheme will not be evident for some time. However, based on the data from Australian production volumes and realised sales prices, we calculate the Alberta royalty scheme would have raised an additional $103bn in revenue since 1988, or an additional $3.7bn a year. As the scheme was only implemented this year, these results may be unrealistic, but are indicative of the level of revenue that could be raised. Over the period from 2010 to 2015, the additional revenue would have been $11.3bn per year. The modelling done for our report considers just two multinational corporations, their use of debt loading and the PRRT. Now we can can hope for more revenue collection from many of the multinationals operating in Australia, as a result of the recent Federal Court ruling. Critically, too often corporations are able to work within Australia\u2019s tax rules to avoid paying for operating here, by constantly arguing they can\u2019t develop business in Australia unless there are tax breaks. Our modelling demonstrates governments need to ensure corporations benefiting from the use of Australia\u2019s resources are contributing the same as they do in other jurisdictions. \u2022 Roman Lanis is an associate professor of accounting, Brett Govendir is a lecturer and Ross McClure is a PhD candidate and casual academic at the University of Technology Sydney.

      "bodyText": "World markets have hit new peaks, pushed higher by continuing optimism about the outcome of the French presidential election, a series of positive US company results and growing anticipation over Donald Trump\u2019s promised tax reforms. The biggest gains on Tuesday came from the US, with the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite breaking the 6,000 barrier for the first time, 17 years after it first reached 5,000 during the height of the dotcom boom. The index was boosted by technology giants such as Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Google and Facebook, which will be among the main beneficiaries of any Trump tax reforms. The president\u2019s long-awaited announcement is now expected on Wednesday, with suggestions of a cut in corporation tax from 35% to 15% and possible reductions in income tax rates, particularly for middle-income earners. The Dow Jones industrial average also moved sharply higher, passing the 21,000 mark for the first time since the middle of March. By Tuesday lunchtime it was up 1.2% at 21,012. US markets were also supported by better-than-expected results from a number of major companies, including construction equipment group Caterpillar, which is also likely to benefit from Trump\u2019s promised infrastructure spending, and burger chain McDonald\u2019s. For the moment, markets are shrugging off any concerns about the administration failing to agree a budget plan, which risks a government shutdown by the weekend if no agreement can be reached. Elsewhere Emmanuel Macron\u2019s first-round French election victory had sent shares surging on Monday, and the prospect of him defeating far-right rival Marine Le Pen in the second round in a fortnight continued to provide some support. Asian shares set the tone overnight with the Nikkei 225 closing just over 1% higher. But with analysts saying a shock victory for Le Pen could not be completely discounted, and growing concerns about Macron\u2019s ability to effect change if he does win, the gains in Europe were more muted. Kathleen Brooks of City Index said: \u201cEquity markets are putting a lot of faith into Macron. He first has to win the second round of the French presidential election and get the keys to the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace, but then his newly formed party has to do well in the national assembly elections in June.\u201d There was also some nervousness ahead of the latest European Central Bank meeting on Thursday, with recent positive economic data from the eurozone prompting analysts to wonder if the bank would begin to call a halt to its economic stimulus measures. France\u2019s Cac closed up 0.17% at 5,277, while Germany\u2019s Dax edged up 0.1% at 12,467, albeit it at another closing high. The Stoxx 600, an index of leading companies across Europe, added 0.2%, its highest level since August 2015, helped by news of a \u20ac12bn (\u00a310bn) deal for LVMH to take full control of fashion house Christian Dior. In the UK, the FTSE 100 finished up 10.96 points (0.15%), supported by a further rise in banking shares as investors bet that a Macron victory would avoid Le Pen\u2019s threat of a eurozone breakup and boost the European banking sector. Meanwhile the MSCI World Index, which measures performance across 23 developed country equity markets, hit a record high for the second day running. Joshua Mahony, a market analyst at IG, said: \u201cUS markets are leading the way higher, as the excitement over Donald Trump\u2019s corporate tax cuts takes the mantle from the French elections ... Despite the optimism of Trump\u2019s tax plan, we are seeing the foreign exchange trends [from Monday] come back into play, with extended gains for the euro ahead of Thursday\u2019s ECB meeting. \u201cWhile much of the focus has been upon a rate-raising Fed, the political cloud that is gradually being lifted over the eurozone is likely to start putting pressure on [ECB president Mario] Draghi and co.\u201d As well as the relief rally over the Macron result, the prospect of an end to the ECB\u2019s bond-buying programme and low interest rate measures saw the euro hit a two-week high against the pound, up 0.39% to \u20ac1.1724. Gold, seen as a haven when investors avoid riskier assets, was out of favour, falling about $15 an ounce to $1,262 (\u00a3980).",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "McDonald\u2019s is to offer 115,000 UK workers on controversial zero-hours contracts the option of moving to fixed contracts with a minimum number of guaranteed hours every week. The move is a significant development in the debate about employee rights because McDonald\u2019s is one of the biggest users of zero-hours contracts in the country. Sports Direct has also used workers on zero-hour contracts in its shops. The fast-food chain is to offer fixed-hours contracts after staff in its restaurants complained they were struggling to get loans, mortgages and mobile phone contracts because they were not guaranteed employment each week. Zero-hour contracts are controversial because companies can use them to exploit workers, offering unpredictable working hours and changing shifts at short notice. The TUC has called for the government to ban zero-hours contracts. It has found that staff on these contracts earns a third less per hour than the average worker. McDonald\u2019s has been trialling the shift to fixed-hours contracts in 23 sites across the country. The company said that about 80% of workers in the trial chose to remain on flexible contracts and it has seen an increase in levels of employee and customer satisfaction after the offer. Staff have been offered contracts in line with the average hours per week they work. This includes contracts of either four, eight, 16, 30 or 35 hours a week. The company will initially expand fixed contracts to 50 more restaurants before rolling it out nationwide to existing and new employees later this year. Paul Pomroy, the chief executive of McDonald\u2019s UK, said: \u201cThe vast majority of our employees are happy with their flexible contracts, but some have told us that more fixed hours would help them get better access to some financial products.\u201d Pomroy denied that McDonald\u2019s was reacting to political pressure by making the change. \u201cWe are reflecting people\u2019s lives. In a growing business we need people to come and work for us, it\u2019s a mutually beneficial approach,\u201d he added. The McDonald\u2019s boss also confirmed that staff who are paid by the hour have had their pay increased by an average of 15% since April 2015. \u201cThe hard work of our restaurant teams has enabled us to deliver 44 consecutive quarters of growth in the UK,\u201d Pomroy said. \u201cIt\u2019s right that we continue to invest in our people so they can deliver the experience that our customers want and expect.\u201d The changes are part of a modernisation drive by McDonald\u2019s that includes the launch of a premium burger, digital touchscreens in restaurants and a new delivery service that will be trialled from June alongside a partner such as Deliveroo. McDonald\u2019s has defended zero-hours contracts in the past, saying they offer flexibility to workers. However, the company has been targeted by protesters over its treatment of staff. Earlier this month, campaigners from Fast Food Rights and Better Than Zero dressed as clowns and demonstrated outside a McDonald\u2019s restaurant in Glasgow over its use of zero-hours contracts. The TUC has warned that 3.5 million people could be stuck in insecure work such as zero-hours contracts, agency work or low-paid self-employment by 2022 \u2013 290,000 more than at present. Frances O\u2019Grady, the TUC general secretary, said: \u201cMPs aren\u2019t the only ones feeling insecure in their jobs right now. If nothing changes, hundreds of thousands more Brits could be stuck in insecure work, being treated like disposable labour. That\u2019s the same as 13 extra Sports Directs, or the entire working population of Sheffield. \u201cPaying rent and bills can be a nightmare when you don\u2019t know how much you\u2019ve got coming in each month. And planning childcare is impossible when you\u2019re constantly at the beck and call of employers. \u201cThe next government will need to tackle this problem head on. Every party manifesto must have real commitments to crack down on zero-hours contracts and bogus self-employment. And agency workers should always get the going rate for the job.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Global markets are still on the front foot, thanks to optimism over Emmanuel Macron winning the second round of the French presidential election, some positive US corporate news and anticipation over President Trump\u2019s forthcoming tax proposals. But with some concerns that there is a chance far right candidate Marine Le Pen could still defeat Macron, the gains in Europe were subdued. But there were no such worries in the US, with the Nasdaq Composite breaking through 6000 for the first time and the Dow Jones Industrial Average also moving sharply higher. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 0.15% or 10.96 points at 7275.64 France\u2019s Cac climbed 0.17% to 5277.88 Germany\u2019s Dax rose 0.1% to 12,467.04 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB was 0.59% better at 20,805.52 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 0.15% at 10,783.1 In Greece, the Athens market added 2.05% to 697.32 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 234 points or 1.1%. On that note it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Commenting on the day\u2019s market moves, Spreadex financial analyst Connor Campbell said: The Macron-move was joined by a Trump and earnings-inspired surge from the Dow Jones this afternoon. There were two main reasons for the Dow\u2019s 200 point jump after the bell... First, impressive updates from McDonald\u2019s, which saw some super-sized, all day breakfast-charged like-for-like sales, and Caterpillar, which posted Q1 EPS of $1.28 against the 62 cents expected, added a chunk of growth, the companies climbing 4.1% and 6.4% respectively. Secondly, and more importantly, investors are getting all hot under the collar for the promised reveal of Donald Trump\u2019s tax plan tomorrow, an announcement abuzz with the President\u2019s trademark haphazardness. These US gains ensured that Europe remained buoyant. Though it couldn\u2019t re-cross 12500, the DAX added another 20 points, while the CAC rose just shy of half a percent as investors continued to cheer the likelihood of a Macron presidency. As for the FTSE, it maintained its 0.3% increase as the day went on, keeping the index a smidge below 7300. Sterling, meanwhile, kept its head above 1.28 against the dollar with a 0.2% rise, but lost even more ground against the euro, falling to a fresh fortnightly low after dropping 0.3%. Meanwhile the Dow Jones Industrial Average has reached 21,000 for the first time since the middle of March, on a mixture of positivity over the French election, a number of good corporate results and anticipation for Donald Trump\u2019s tax reforms. In other US data, single family home sales jumped to an eight month high in March. Sales rose 5.8% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 621,000 units, but February\u2019s figure was revised down from 592,000 to 587,000. US consumers were less confident than expected in April, partly due to concerns about the jobs market. The Conference Board consumer confidence index came in at 120.3 in April, below the 122.5 that analysts had been expecting. The March figure was revised down from 125.6 to 124.9. Lynn Franco, director of economic indicators at the Conference Board, said: Consumer confidence declined in April after increasing sharply over the past two months, but still remains at strong levels. Consumers assessed current business conditions and, to a lesser extent, the labor market less favorably than in March. Looking ahead, consumers were somewhat less optimistic about the short-term outlook for business conditions, employment and income prospects. Despite April\u2019s decline, consumers remain confident that the economy will continue to expand in the months ahead. On the jobs market, the Conference Board added: Consumers\u2019 assessment of the labor market was moderately less favorable. Those stating jobs are \u201cplentiful\u201d declined from 31.8 percent to 30.8 percent, while those claiming jobs are \u201chard to get\u201d was virtually unchanged at 19.1 percent. The Nasdaq Composite first hit 5000 back in 2000 at the height of the dotcom boom. But the subsequent bust meant it has taken 17 years for the index to add the next 1000 points to get to 6000. US markets have again joined the global optimism, with the technology led Nasdaq Composite hitting 6000 for the first time. The chances of Emmanuel Macron winning the French presidential election at the expense of far right rival Marine Le Pen has pushed share prices higher, while investors are also anticipating US president Donald Trump\u2019s tax announcement. Trump is said to be about to announce more details of his plans on Wednesday, including a possible cut to corporation tax to 15%. Meanwhile a host of positive results, notably from McDonalds and Caterpillar, have also provided support. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 190 points or 0.9% better while Nasdaq opened up 0.34% at 6004 and the S&amp;P 500 was up a similar amount. Ahead of the Wall Street open, new figures show that US house prices rose more quickly than expected in February. The S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Schiller index of 20 metropolitan areas rose 5.9% in February, compared to 5.7% in January and expectations of 5.7% again. This was the biggest year on year increase since July 2014. David M. Blitzer of the index compilers said: \u201cThere are still relatively few existing homes listed for sale and the small 3.8 month supply is supporting the recent price increases. Housing affordability has declined since 2012 as the pressure of higher prices has been a larger factor than stable to lower mortgage rates.\u201d The US stock market is expected to rise when trading begins in under 40 minutes. That\u2019s thanks to fast food chain McDonald\u2019s, and construction and mining equipment maker Caterpillar. Both companies have beaten analyst forecasts for sales and profits today. Bad news for the UK: 300 jobs are reportedly being cut at Nestle. The Swiss chocolate maker is also moving production of its Blue Riband bar to Poland, unions say. Over in Berlin, Donald Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka is rubbing shoulders with some of the world\u2019s most powerful women, at the W20 women\u2019s empowerment summit. The event, backed by the G20 group of advanced economies, is aiming to increase women\u2019s economic empowerment. Its motto is: \u201cInspiring women: scaling up women\u2019s entrepreneurship\u201d The W20 wants to help more women into work, raise the value of work traditionally carried out by women, help more to become entrepreneurs, and close the digital gender divide. Ivanka was invited by German chancellor Angela Merkel; seemingly as part of Merkel\u2019s attempt to build bridges with the new US government. Buzzfeed\u2019s Jina Moore reports that president Trump\u2019s attitudes to women have come up.... Angela Merkel, though, is focusing on Ivanka Trump\u2019s business know-how: Ivanka seems to have received a somewhat bracing reception, tweets Politico\u2019s Annie Karn: NBC\u2019s Hallie Jackson concurs: This wave of investor optimism is jolly good news for the world\u2019s richest men and women. Bloomberg has calculated that Europe\u2019s billionaires added $27.5bn to their collective fortunes (on paper, anyway), thanks to the jump in share prices on Monday. Amancio Ortega Gaona, the Spanish retail magnate behind the Zara chain, became $2.7bn richer - overtaking Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos to become the world\u2019s second richest person, Bloomberg say: The latest Guardian Brexit Dashboard is out, showing the state of Britain\u2019s economy since last June\u2019s EU referendum. And the warning light next to \u2018living standards\u2019 is flashing alarmingly, as rising inflation hits household incomes. Katie Allen, who compiles the Dashboard, explains that the The pound\u2019s sharp fall since the Brexit vote and a mood of uncertainty among employers has hit household budgets creating a tough economic backdrop for Theresa May\u2019s snap election, a Guardian analysis shows. The prime minister will be hoping the resilience seen in the UK economy in the wake of last summer\u2019s referendum will hold over the coming months now that she has called an election for this June. But the Guardian\u2019s monthly tracker of economic news shows living standards are already falling as rising prices outpace meagre pay growth. That bodes ill for an economy reliant on household spending and the latest indicators from Britain\u2019s retail and leisure industries suggest they are feeling the effects of a tightening consumer squeeze. The export sector has failed to offset that domestic drag and GDP figures due this week are expected to show the economy slowed markedly at the start of this year. Here\u2019s the full report: European stock markets are holding onto this morning\u2019s gains, keeping the MSCI World Index at record levels. In London, the FTSE 100 is 20 points higher, while France\u2019s CAC has also added to Monday\u2019s 4% surge. Connor Campbell of trading firm SpreadEx says the market\u2019s \u201clove affair\u201d with Macron helped markets to record highs. But.... The latest opinion polls have Macron crushing Le Pen with more than 60% of the vote; however, the far right has continually beaten the odds in the last year and a half, so there could still be some more volatility in store before May\u2019s second election. The latest opinion polls suggests that Emmanuel Macron would win comfortably on May 7th. BUT.... my colleague Natalie Nougayr\u00e8de says it\u2019s \u201cdelusional and dangerous\u201d to assume the race is over. Turnout in the second round could be low if people think it\u2019s a foregone conclusion, for example. Or Marine Le Pen could win more votes from the defeated candidates than Macron - particularly as left-wing candidate Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon hasn\u2019t yet backed either side. She explains: If playing with fire in politics means anything, this was it. M\u00e9lenchon spoke dismissively of both, as if unable or unwilling to see the difference. He announced that his radical left movement, France Unbowed, would organise an online \u201cconsultation\u201d designed to determine its position ahead of the run-off. It was as bewildering as it was disgraceful. And it was a deliberate attempt to deny or minimise what is now at play. Yet the choice France now faces could not be more clear-cut: an open, liberal message versus a closed, illiberal one. A platform of inclusiveness versus one of bigotry and nationalist hatred. A promise to strengthen the European project through reform versus a pledge to close borders, introduce protectionism and pull out of Euro-Atlantic structures. It\u2019s also a choice between a candidate who resolutely criticises President Putin and his worldview, and one who consistently panders to the Russian autocrat and has been financially dependent on his networks. In the bond markets, the gap between German and French borrowing costs has narrowed this morning, extending Monday\u2019s moves. That shows investors are less anxious about France quitting the eurozone - a possibility if Marine Le Pen becomes French president. Financial market volatility has slumped since the French election results were released on Sunday night. That shows that investors are pleased that Emmanuel Macron will fight Marine Le Pen for the presidency. Peter Rosenstreich of Swissquote bank has the details: The most interesting result of the French election vote was the collapse of volatility indicators globally. The VIX index declined -19% from 15.30 while one-month implied volatility in the euro-US dollar exchange rate fell to 8.20 from 13.45. The JP Morgan G7 volatility index fell to 8.03, a level not seen since November 2014. Let\u2019s get back to the stock market rally! And Donald Trump can take some credit for the rise in share prices this week. Yesterday, a White House official revealed that the president is seeking to slash US corporation tax to just 15%, from 35% today. Such a dramatic cut goes further than current proposals on Capitol Hill, and would deliver on a key Trump campaign pledge (making it something of a collector\u2019s item at this early stage of the presidency...). Apparently, Trump\u2019s advisors believe that cutting taxes on companies would pay for itself in the long-run by encouraging economic activity and spurring growth. That\u2019s debatable, depending where you think we are on the Laffer Curve (and if you believe in it at all). In the short run, though, such a move would create a big hole in the US budget - driving its deficit and national debt higher, and possibly creating a major row with Congress. But the scent of tax cuts is having its usual effect on investors, helping to push shares higher. Ipek Ozkrdeskaya of London Capital Markets explains: The US stocks were resuscitated after the White House announced that the US corporate taxes will be cut by 15% as part of Donald Trump\u2019s \u2018major\u2019 fiscal plans. According to the latest news, the personal income taxes will also be reduced. More details are due at the Wednesday\u2019s announcement. Donald Trump will prioritize the tax cuts over the budget deficit. In this respect, the US debt ceiling should be adjusted to avoid an eventual government shutdown. Nevertheless, the early highlights regarding the very much expected tax reforms pleased the private sector investors. The optimism is back in the US markets. Matt Whittaker of Resolution Foundation has tweeted a handy chart, showing how the UK deficit has fallen over the last few years: But.... the independent Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts borrowing will jump to \u00a358bn in the current financial year. There\u2019s no room for complacency about the state of Britain\u2019s public finances, just because the deficit fell to \u00a352bn last year. So argues John Hawksworth, PwC chief economist, who fears that borrowing could be driven up again. He says: A number of one-off factors relating to the timing of tax receipts and spending flattered the deficit figures for 2016/17 but are likely to be reversed in 2017/18. \u201cHigher inflation will also act as a drag on growth over the next year while boosting some benefit payments that are linked to prices. So the improvement in the deficit could well be reversed in the coming financial year as the OBR predicted. \u201cIn the longer term an ageing population and rising healthcare costs will also put pressure on the public finances. So while the deficit is now approaching a more sustainable level, there will still be some tough choices ahead on tax and spending for the next government.\u201d Breaking: Britain\u2019s annual public deficit has fallen to its lowest level in almost a decade. The UK borrowed \u00a352bn in the 2016-17 financial year, new figures show. That\u2019s slightly above the \u00a351.7bn predicted in last month\u2019s budget, but around \u00a320bn or 28% lower than the previous year. This is the smallest annual deficit since 2007-08, and the start of the financial crisis which rocked Britain\u2019s financial sector and triggered a deep recession. Disappointingly, March\u2019s deficit rose by \u00a3800m to \u00a35.1bn, rather larger than expected. And Britain\u2019s total national debt is now around \u00a31.7 trillion. Markets do have a strong history of getting carried away by political events, especially if their favourite candidate is doing well. So we should treat this rally with some caution, as Emmanuel Macron hasn\u2019t yet proved he can deliver on his promises. The first challenges will be to win seats in the French national assembly in June. Kathleen Brooks of City Index says there is a significant risk that Macron struggles to implement a reform agenda in France. She writes: Equity markets are putting a lot of faith into Macron, he first has to win the second round of the French Presidential election and get the keys to the Elysee Palace, but then his newly formed party has to do well in the National Assembly elections in June. French banks have been the immediate beneficiaries to Macron\u2019s strong showing in the first round of the vote. Societe General, BNP Paribas and Credit Agricole rose 9.5%, 7.5% and 10.8% respectively on Monday. This is to be expected, as they are most correlated to the economy and are likely to salute a pro-business Presidential candidate. However, they are also most at risk if Macron\u2019s En Marche! Party do not get enough seats in the National Assembly elections in two months\u2019 time, which would make it hard for Macron to get his pro-growth agenda into action. Thus, European political risk is not at bay completely. The French presidential rate took another twist last night, when Marine Le Pen announced she was stepping aside as leader of the National Front. That may help her win support from voters who aren\u2019t impressed by Macron, but can\u2019t stomach placing a cross next to a party with such a toxic past. Robin Bew of the Economist Intelligence Unit says it\u2019s a clever idea, but not enough to win the second round of voting. Optimism over the French election is pushing the euro up this morning. It\u2019s gained 0.2% to $1.089, close to the five-month high struck on Sunday night. Good news for the next French president -- the country\u2019s business leaders are at their most optimistic since 2011. Bullish investors are in \u201cfirm control\u201d of the markets right now, says Chris Weston of IG. Weston writes: Despite concerns of elevated valuation, macroeconomic and geopolitical risks, the fact the MSCI World index is at an all-time high is remarkable, especially when we think that we haven\u2019t seen a 2% pullback for 120 trading sessions. The \u201chighly likely\u201d prospect of Emmanuel Macron becoming France\u2019s next president is encouraging traders to buy European shares and French bonds, and driving down the cost of insuring against France defaulting on its debts, he adds. India\u2019s main stock index, the NSE Nifty, has swept to a new all-time high today. Tirthankar Patnaik, India strategist at Mizuho Bank, explains: \u201cGlobal markets have been very positive on news from the French election,\u201d More here: Nifty hits record high; rupee strengthens Markets are in a \u201cparty mood\u201d this morning thanks to last Sunday\u2019s French elections, says FXTM chief market strategist Hussein Sayed. It now appears that investors are confident that Macron will be France\u2019s next president and will win the battle on 7 May easily. Investors who lost confidence in pollsters after they failed to predict the outcomes of the U.S. elections and Brexit vote are all of a sudden viewing them as credible sources of information again... The importance of this one single event was reflected in asset classes across the globe, but whether this rally will have legs depends on how big Macron wins. Macron would need to win by a margin of more than 60% in the second round to unite a divided country and ensure that the spread of populism ends in France. Frankfurt traders have pushed the German DAZ to new record highs: European stock markets are inching higher this morning, adding to yesterday\u2019s strong rally. The French CAC, German DAX and UK FTSE 100 have all gained a little ground in early trading, helping to send global markets to record levels. Global stock markets have hit their highest ever levels this morning, as relief over the French presidential election continues to sweep through trading floors. The MSCI World Index - a broad measure of markets around the globe - has hit an all-time high today, for the second session running. The rally is driven by expectations that Emmanuel Macron will become France\u2019s next president, calming fears that the European Union could be dragged into another political crisis. Shares have risen in Asia overnight, with the Japanese market gaining over 1%, and Hong Kong and India also up. Investor are reacting to poll suggesting that Macron would comfortably beat his opponent, Marine Le Pen Yesterday, European markets surged after Macron claimed a place in the run-off, with France\u2019s CAC leaping by 4% to a nine year high. Guy Foster, Head of Research at Brewin Dolphin, agrees that Macron looks highly likely to succeed Francois Hollande. He says: \u201cFollowing the first-round election we are now in a crucial fortnight for France in which the impact of terror events, further WikiLeaks\u2019 disclosures or potential scandals are multiplied by the fact that if Macron the centrist doesn\u2019t win, Le Pen the extremist will. Nevertheless, the chances of an Emmanuel Macron victory in the run-off election are very high indeed. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets suggests that investors may be being too optimistic about Macron\u2019s ability to change France. Markets are surmising that Emmanuel Macron is a dead certainty to be French President in two weeks\u2019 time, and while this is probably the most benign outcome at a time of rising populism it completely overlooks the challenges facing the new French President when he or she takes office on May 8th. For a start while Mr Macron is an outsider from the established political order, he will still be viewed by the majority of the 40% of French people who voted for anti-Euro candidates, as very much part of the same elite who he has helped to push to one side in this particular vote, which means he will be presiding over a country very much ill at ease with itself. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. We\u2019re about to discover how much Britain was forced to borrow to meet its financial needs last year, and whether it hit its targets. At 9.30am, the Office for National Statistics publishes the public finance figures for March. That will show the deficit last month, and across the full 2016-17 financial year. Last month, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) forecast that government borrowing would hit \u00a351.7bn this year. That was down from the \u00a368.2bn forecast in November, and much better than the \u00a371bn borrowed in 2015-16. As of last month, Britain had borrowed around \u00a347.8bn, implying that the nation will have tapped the markets for another \u00a33bn or so in March. With an election looming, the UK government will surely hail the figures as proof that it is getting the deficit down. But, Britain\u2019s total debt pile is still going up, of course - as there\u2019s no prospect of an actual surplus in the next few years. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets says: Macro data this morning includes March UK Public Finances with net borrowing set to continue to rise following January\u2019s seasonal drop on corporation tax receipts and accounting revisions. Also coming up today... Investors will be watching France closely, ahead of the presidential run-off between Emmanuel Macron and Marine Le Pen on May 7th. In the City, hotels and coffee chain Whitbread, flooring company Carpetright, wealth manager St James\u2019s Place and financial services group Virgin Money are all reporting results.",

More details are due at the Wednesday\u2019s announcement.

      "bodyText": "The once-ailing music industry has hit a \u201chistorical tipping point\u201d, recording its second year of growth and revenues of $15.7bn (\u00a312.2bn) in 2016, according to a report. An in-depth look into the health of the music industry by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) has shown that in 2016 there was 5.9% growth, mainly attributed to the mass adoption of streaming across the world. It is a vastly different story from the previous 15 years, where record labels saw a decline of 40% in revenue as piracy took its toll, physical sales declined and record shops went out of business. In its early years, streaming was derided by many musicians and observers as the final nail in the industry\u2019s coffin. However, with 112 million paying subscribers to services such as Spotify, Apple Music and Tidal, which ensured growth in streaming revenue went up by more than 60% last year, it has now been hailed as the saviour of music. Executives in the industry said a \u201cspirit of optimism\u201d had emerged, as they witnessed the rapid increase in people willing to pay for streaming services, which cost an average of \u00a39.99 a month. \u201cWe got here through years of hard work,\u201d said Michael Nash, executive vice president of digital strategy at Universal records, who said the music industry was still going through a \u201chistorical transformation\u201d. \u201cThe only reason we saw growth in the past two years, after some 15 years of substantial decline, is that music has been one of the fastest adapting sectors in the digital world.\u201d Frances Moore, chief executive of IFPI, said that their reversal of fortunes \u201chasn\u2019t happened by chance; as an industry we\u2019ve had huge innovation and investment to make it happen.\u201d Moore said that while last year record labels and musicians were still adapting to the new ways of consuming music, they were now the ones driving the growth in digital, and said the streaming sector had \u201climitless potential\u201d. The most popular artists of 2016 were Drake, David Bowie, Coldplay and Adele, while Beyonce\u2019s lemonade was the top album of last year and Drake\u2019s One Dance was the biggest digital single. Dennis Kooker, an executive at Sony, attributed much of the growth in streaming to increased competition, with Apple Music and Tidal both emerging as major forces in the streaming realm, alongside Spotify, over the past year. \u201cI think we will look back at 2016 as a tipping point for the industry,\u201d he said. Kooker added that even though streaming services have enabled artists to easily put their music out without the backing of a record label, he belived labels still played a vital role in the industry. \u201cUltimately now the job of the record labels is to cut through the amount of competition we see for consumer attention.\u201d Stu Bergen, a CEO at Warner Music, remained cautious but encouraged. \u201cRemember, we\u2019re only two years into our recovery,\u201d he said. \u201cWe must remain alert, resourceful and ambitious. We\u2019re no longer running up a down escalator, but that doesn\u2019t mean we can relax. \u201cWe\u2019re still in the early, vulnerable stages of our transformation.\u201d Despite being the biggest new player in the music industry, Spotify has operated at a loss for the past decade, reporting a $195.5m operating loss in 2015, though some are predicting that will soon change. But while revenue made from physical formats declined by another 7.6% last year, physical sales still make up the majority of revenue in some of the biggest markets, including France, Germany and Japan, where 70% of profits are still from CD and record sales. The biggest demise was from digital download revenue, which fell by more than 20%, affirming the belief of many industry observers that it will cease to exist as a format in the next few years. The note of caution from music executives mainly originated in the continued problem of the \u201cvalue gap\u201d generated by platforms such as YouTube, which have 900 million users worldwide but host millions of unlicensed videos and pay a fraction of the royalties record labels believe they are due. While Spotify contributes an average of $20 per user to the music industry, YouTube returns less than $1. It meant that YouTube, and other user upload video services, contributed just $553m in revenue in 2016, compared to the $3.9bn contributed by Spotify - despite the streaming service having a quarter fewer users. Nash said: \u201cThe scope of this inequality casts a shadow across the whole landscape that cannot be ignored. The longer it is permitted, the greater the threat to the music ecosystem. The value gap must not be permitted to derail our mission, we\u2019ve worked too hard.\u201d EU legislation is currently being tabled over greater transparency and accountability for royalties from digital services, and there are also moves to tackle it in the USA. They also acknowledged that streaming had given rise to a new type of piracy \u2013 stream ripping. The IFPI report showed that 46% of 16-24 year olds had illegally ripped songs from YouTube or streaming sites. Sony, Warner and Universal were still divided on their marketing strategies using streaming. Last year, Universal announced they would be ending exclusive album distribution deals with streaming services, a move thought to be prompted by Frank Ocean independently releasing his album Blonde through Apple, just two days after he contractually released his visual album Endless through Universal imprint Def Jam. Nash said Universal\u2019s current position was now to aim for the \u201cbroadest possible market\u201d for their releases, rather than working with just one platform, a change of tune from last year when they had made several elusive streaming deals. Kooker, however, said that Sony would consider it for certain artists when it was \u201cwhat\u2019s best for an individual release\u201d. Bergen was clear that Warner, who have cut the fewest of such deals, intended to keep it that way, saying: \u201cWe\u2019ve been fairly clear all along that exclusive deals are not in the bests interests of growing the entire sector.\u201d",

However, with 112 million paying subscribers to services such as Spotify, Apple Music and Tidal, which ensured growth in streaming revenue went up by more than 60% last year, it has now been hailed as the saviour of music. <br></p> <p>Executives in the industry said a \u201cspirit of optimism\u201d had emerged, as they witnessed the rapid increase in people willing to pay for streaming services, which cost an average of \u00a39.99 a month. </p> <p>\u201cWe got here through years of hard work,\u201d said Michael Nash, executive vice president of digital strategy at Universal records, who said the music industry was still going through a \u201chistorical transformation\u201d.</p> <p> \u201cThe only reason we saw growth in the past two years, after some 15 years of substantial decline, is that music has been one of the fastest adapting sectors in the digital world.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/jan/03/record-sales-vinyl-hits-25-year-high-and-outstrips-streaming\">Record sales: vinyl hits 25-year high</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Frances Moore, chief executive of IFPI, said that their reversal of fortunes \u201chasn\u2019t happened by chance; as an industry we\u2019ve had huge innovation and investment to make it happen.\u201d Moore said that while last year record labels and musicians were still adapting to the new ways of consuming music, they were now the ones driving the growth in digital, and said the streaming sector had \u201climitless potential\u201d. </p> <p>The most popular artists of 2016 were Drake, David Bowie, Coldplay and Adele, while Beyonce\u2019s lemonade was the top album of last year and Drake\u2019s One Dance was the biggest digital single. </p> <p>Dennis Kooker, an executive at Sony, attributed much of the growth in streaming to increased competition, with Apple Music and Tidal both emerging as major forces in the streaming realm, alongside Spotify, over the past year.</p> <p>\u201cI think we will look back at 2016 as a tipping point for the industry,\u201d he said. Kooker added that even though streaming services have enabled artists to easily put their music out without the backing of a record label, he belived labels still played a vital role in the industry.</p> <p>\u201cUltimately now the job of the record labels is to cut through the amount of competition we see for consumer attention.\u201d</p> <p>Stu Bergen, a CEO at Warner Music, remained cautious but encouraged. \u201cRemember, we\u2019re only two years into our recovery,\u201d he said. \u201cWe must remain alert, resourceful and ambitious. We\u2019re no longer running up a down escalator, but that doesn\u2019t mean we can relax.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re still in the early, vulnerable stages of our transformation.\u201d</p> <p>Despite being the biggest new player in the music industry, Spotify has operated at a loss for the past decade, reporting a $195.5m operating loss in 2015, though some are predicting that will soon change. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8e23a9a450fdc4d31cf758ab5b2d75da5b2275e4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8e23a9a450fdc4d31cf758ab5b2d75da5b2275e4/227_0_3073_1844/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Spotify logo\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Spotify has operated at a loss for the past decade.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Matthews/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But while revenue made from physical formats declined by another 7.6% last year, physical sales still make up the majority of revenue in some of the biggest markets, including France, Germany and Japan, where 70% of profits are still from CD and record sales. </p> <p>The biggest demise was from digital download revenue, which fell by more than 20%, affirming the belief of many industry observers that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/26/spotify-music-download-apple-itunes-streaming-vinyl\">it will cease to exist as a format</a> in the next few years.</p> <p>The note of caution from music executives mainly originated in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/apr/15/music-industry-youtube-video-streaming-royalties\">continued problem of the \u201cvalue gap\u201d generated by platforms such as YouTube</a>, which have 900 million users worldwide but host millions of unlicensed videos and pay a fraction of the royalties record labels believe they are due.</p> <p>While Spotify contributes an average of $20 per user to the music industry, YouTube returns less than $1. It meant that YouTube, and other user upload video services, contributed just $553m in revenue in 2016, compared to the $3.9bn contributed by Spotify - despite the streaming service having a quarter fewer users. </p> <p>Nash said: \u201cThe scope of this inequality casts a shadow across the whole landscape that cannot be ignored. The longer it is permitted, the greater the threat to the music ecosystem. The value gap must not be permitted to derail our mission, we\u2019ve worked too hard.\u201d</p> <p>EU legislation is currently being tabled over greater transparency and accountability for royalties from digital services, and there are also moves to tackle it in the USA. </p> <p>They also acknowledged that streaming had given rise to a new type of piracy \u2013 stream ripping. The IFPI report showed that 46% of 16-24 year olds had illegally ripped songs from YouTube or streaming sites. </p> <p>Sony, Warner and Universal were still divided on their marketing strategies using streaming. Last year, Universal announced they would be ending exclusive album distribution deals with streaming services, a move thought to be prompted by Frank Ocean independently releasing his album Blonde through Apple, just two days after he contractually released his visual album Endless through Universal imprint Def Jam.</p> <p>Nash said Universal\u2019s current position was now to aim for the \u201cbroadest possible market\u201d for their releases, rather than working with just one platform, a change of tune from last year when they had made several elusive streaming deals. </p> <p>Kooker, however, said that Sony would consider it for certain artists when it was \u201cwhat\u2019s best for an individual release\u201d. Bergen was clear that Warner, who have cut the fewest of such deals, intended to keep it that way, saying: \u201cWe\u2019ve been fairly clear all along that exclusive deals are not in the bests interests of growing the entire sector.\u201d</p>",

The Swiss confectioner said most of the jobs would be lost in Newcastle and York, during 2017-18, but that its sites in Halifax, West Yorkshire, and Girvan, Ayrshire, would also be affected. The change will end 81 years of British production of the wafer snack, which was originally manufactured in Scotland but is now made in Nestl\u00e9\u2019s Fawdon plant in Newcastle. The company said: \u201cThese proposals are being made by Nestl\u00e9 UK to ensure that these sites operate more efficiently and remain competitive in a rapidly changing external environment. Our factory in Kargowa, Poland, is a centre of excellence for this type of wafer-based product and is the logical place for us to propose Blue Riband production takes place [there] in the future.\u201d However, the GMB and Unite unions said the proposed cuts were savage and unacceptable, and urged the government to intervene. \u201cNestl\u00e9 are throwing people\u2019s lives, and those of their families, into turmoil for the sake of increasing profit margins,\u201d said the GMB general secretary, Tim Roache. \u201cThese factories should be exporting chocolate \u2013 not people\u2019s jobs. The government needs to step in before it\u2019s too late and reassure millions of workers across the country this is not just the tip of the Brexit iceberg.\u201d Nestl\u00e9 said it expected most of thecuts to come from voluntary redundancies. The company has earmarked cuts of 143 jobs in York, 110 at Fawdon, 15 in Halifax, and seven in Girvan. At Fawdon, which employs about 600 people, Nestl\u00e9 produces a number of products as well as the Blue Riband bar, including Rowntree\u2019s Fruit Pastilles, Fruit Gums, Jelly Tots, Rolos, and Matchmakers. The company also makes KitKat, Polo and Milky Bar in York. Julia Long, Unite\u2019s national officer, said unions would fight the plans to shed jobs. \u201cWe will be campaigning to save as many jobs as possible and pressing Nestl\u00e9 to think again about these plans which will see the loss of hundreds jobs and the production of an iconic biscuit shipped to Poland,\u201d he said. \u201cRather than turning its back on its UK workforce, Nestl\u00e9 should be investing in its UK operations and keeping production here at plants in the UK. Over the coming days we will be scrutinising the company\u2019s business rationale for these job losses, and explore alternatives to its cut-and-run approach.\u201d Nestl\u00e9, which employs more than 8,000 people in the UK, said it would begin a 45-day consultation on the proposals with unions and workers\u2019 representatives as soon as possible.

    "webTitle": "UK government borrowing at lowest level since 2008 financial crisis", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Government borrowing fell to the lowest level since the financial crisis in the year to the end of March as the economy proved more resilient than expected in the aftermath of the Brexit vote. Borrowing fell by \u00a320bn to \u00a352bn in the 2016-17 financial year after economic growth helped drive tax receipts higher, narrowing the gap between what the government spends and earns. It was the lowest level of annual borrowing since 2007-08, according to the Office for National Statistics, before the full impact of the financial crisis was reflected in the public finances. The lower deficit meant the chancellor, Philip Hammond, essentially met his \u00a351.7bn target for borrowing in 2016-17, as outlined by the Treasury\u2019s independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility, at the time of the budget in March. Howard Archer, the chief UK economist at IHS Markit, said the lower deficit would be welcome news for Hammond. \u201cThis is helpful for the chancellor\u2019s and government\u2019s credibility, which is all the more welcome given the looming snap general election,\u201d he said. \u201cPhilip Hammond is clearly keen to keep fiscal ammunition up his sleeve \u2013 due to the major uncertainties and downside risks that the economy faces as it navigates its way out of the EU.\u201d However, borrowing for the final month of the financial year was almost \u00a32bn more than expected at \u00a35.1bn. It was the highest borrowing in the month of March since 2015. The deficit has been falling since 2012-13, having peaked at almost \u00a3152bn during the financial crisis in 2009-10. However, the OBR expects borrowing to rise again this year, to \u00a355.2bn, partly due to one-off factors but also because of slowing growth as consumers rein in spending in response to rising shop prices. Hammond conceded last November that Brexit would weigh on the public finances, abandoning plans to run a surplus by the end of the decade. John Hawksworth, the chief economist at PwC, said the government would have to make difficult decisions on tax and spending. \u201cIt is good news that the deficit is coming down, but it is too soon to be complacent about the state of the public finances. In the longer term an ageing population and rising healthcare costs will also put pressure on the public finances,\u201d he said. \u201cSo while the deficit is now approaching a more sustainable level, there will still be some tough choices ahead on tax and spending for the next government.\u201d Responding to the latest figures, the OBR cautioned that 2016-17 borrowing was likely to be revised over the coming months, because some of the data at this stage \u2013 such as cash VAT receipts \u2013 was based on forecasts and estimates. \u201cThe figures typically take some months to settle down and revisions can be significant. In the six years since 2010-11, initial estimates of net borrowing have been revised down by an average of \u00a32.8bn over the subsequent 12 months,\u201d it said. In a separate report, the ONS said the richest fifth of UK households had an average income before tax and benefits of \u00a384,700 in the financial year ending 2016, compared with \u00a37,200 for the poorest. That was a ratio of 12 to one, down from 14 to one a year earlier following an increase in pay the poorest fifth. The ratio between the average income of the top and bottom fifth of households \u2013\u00a363,300 and \u00a317,200 respectively \u2013 is reduced to less than four to one after accounting for benefits and taxes. However, the Equality Trust, which campaigns to reduce economic inequality, said its own analysis of the figures showed the richest 10% of households pay a smaller proportion of their income in tax than the poorest 10% of households. \u201cWhen the super-rich are paying less in taxes than their cleaners, you know something has gone disastrously wrong with our broken, regressive tax system,\u201d said Wanda Wyporska, the executive director of the Equality Trust. \u201cTime after time we see sensible reforms attacked and rejected in favour of tax cuts for billionaires. These do nothing for ordinary people struggling to keep a roof over their head.\u201d",

However, the OBR expects borrowing to rise again this year, to \u00a355.2bn, partly due to one-off factors but also because of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/mar/08/uk-economy-will-grow-2-this-year-but-slow-next-obr-predicts\">slowing growth as consumers rein in spending in response to rising shop prices</a>.</p> <p>Hammond conceded last November <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/nov/23/philip-hammond-brexit-vote-borrowing-autumn-statement\">that Brexit would weigh on the public finances</a>, abandoning plans to run a surplus by the end of the decade.</p> <p>John Hawksworth, the chief economist at PwC, said the government would have to make difficult decisions on tax and spending.</p> <p>\u201cIt is good news that the deficit is coming down, but it is too soon to be complacent about the state of the public finances. In the longer term an ageing population and rising healthcare costs will also put pressure on the public finances,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cSo while the deficit is now approaching a more sustainable level, there will still be some tough choices ahead on tax and spending for the next government.\u201d</p> <p>Responding to the latest figures, the OBR cautioned that 2016-17 borrowing was likely to be revised over the coming months, because some of the data at this stage \u2013 such as cash VAT receipts \u2013 was based on forecasts and estimates. </p> <p>\u201cThe figures typically take some months to settle down and revisions can be significant. In the six years since 2010-11, initial estimates of net borrowing have been revised down by an average of \u00a32.8bn over the subsequent 12 months,\u201d it said.</p> <p>In a separate report, the ONS said the richest fifth of UK households had an average income before tax and benefits of \u00a384,700 in the financial year ending 2016, compared with \u00a37,200 for the poorest. That was a ratio of 12 to one, down from 14 to one a year earlier following an increase in pay the poorest fifth.</p> <p>The ratio between the average income of the top and bottom fifth of households \u2013\u00a363,300 and \u00a317,200 respectively \u2013 is reduced to less than four to one after accounting for benefits and taxes.</p> <p>However, the Equality Trust, which campaigns to reduce economic inequality, said its own analysis of the figures showed the richest 10% of households pay a smaller proportion of their income in tax than the poorest 10% of households.</p> <p>\u201cWhen the super-rich are paying less in taxes than their cleaners, you know something has gone disastrously wrong with our broken, regressive tax system,\u201d said Wanda Wyporska, the executive director of the Equality Trust.</p> <p>\u201cTime after time we see sensible reforms attacked and rejected in favour of tax cuts for billionaires. These do nothing for ordinary people struggling to keep a roof over their head.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "The boss of Costa Coffee owner Whitbread has welcomed the proposals being discussed to avoid labour shortages in cafes and restaurants following Brexit, such as the idea of \u201cbarista visas\u201d. Home secretary Amber Rudd is reportedly considering introducing \u201cbarista visas\u201d to ensure coffee shops, restaurants and bars are fully staffed after Brexit. The proposal was made by Lord Green, chairman of thinktank Migration Watch UK, who suggested two-year visas for young EU citizens allowing them to come to Britain to work, although they will not be able to claim benefits. It is based on the current Youth Mobility Scheme for travellers from Australia, New Zealand and Canada. Whitbread\u2019s chief executive Alison Brittain, a former Lloyds banker, said: \u201cWhat is really encouraging is that people are starting to talk about solutions and options.\u201d But she added that it would take many months for formal proposals to emerge. She noted the importance of the hospitality industry to the UK economy \u2013 it is the fourth largest industry, accounts for 10% of GDP and employs 5 million people. Brittain said 80% of the company\u2019s 50,000 staff were British nationals and the remainder EU citizens; Costa alone employs 14,500 people. Whitbread, which also owns budget hotel chain Premier Inn as well as Brewers Fayre and Beefeater restaurants, hires about 3,000 people every year. The British Hospitality Association has warned that some hotels and restaurants would go bust without the steady stream of migrants, and that it would take businesses a decade to replace EU staff. The warning came after the human resources director of the sandwich chain Pret a Manger said just one in 50 applicants for jobs at the company were British. Costa opened 184 new stores in the UK last year, taking the total to 2,218, and installed more than 1,500 Costa Express machines worldwide. Brittain also warned of a \u201ctougher consumer environment\u201d this year, with household budgets squeezed by the weak pound causing price rises, static wages and higher petrol prices. \u201cWe are starting to see some changes in consumer spending patterns,\u201d she said. She said recent sales data had shown a slowdown in consumer spending. \u201cThere is going to be some constraint on the pound in the average consumer pocket.\u201d The warning rattled investors, and Whitbread shares fell by 8% to \u00a339.62. Sales have slowed at Costa and Premier Inn, which are also under pressure from rivals such as Airbnb, other large coffee shop chains and the growing popularity of artisan cafes. Canada\u2019s Tim Hortons is to open its first UK coffee shop in Glasgow in May. Brittain described this as an \u201cinteresting arrival in the UK\u201d, but did not think the chain would expand rapidly here. Whitbread\u2019s full-year results showed Costa sales rose by 2% on a like-for-like basis in the year to 2 March, compared with 2.9% the previous year. At Premier Inn, sales growth slowed to 2.3% from 4.2%. Underlying group profits increased by 6% to \u00a3565m. Whitbread has invested heavily in Costa, installing MerryChef ovens and microwaves. It has introduced a deal for a \u00a31 bacon roll if it is bought with a coffee at breakfast time, with new salads to be added to the menu in the summer and hot food in the autumn. The company has also negotiated new supplier deals, as the slide in sterling has pushed up the cost of imported materials since the EU referendum, as part of a \u00a3150m cost efficiency programme.",

      "bodyText": "The pound\u2019s sharp fall since the Brexit vote and a mood of uncertainty among employers has hit household budgets, creating a tough economic backdrop for Theresa May\u2019s snap election, a Guardian analysis shows. The prime minister will be hoping the resilience seen in the UK economy will hold over the coming months now that she has called an election for this June. But the Guardian\u2019s monthly tracker of economic news shows living standards are already falling as rising prices outpace meagre pay growth. That bodes ill for an economy reliant on household spending and the latest indicators from Britain\u2019s retail and leisure industries suggest they are feeling the effects of a tightening consumer squeeze. The export sector has failed to offset that domestic drag and GDP figures due this week are expected to show the economy slowed markedly at the start of this year. Still, lending support to those who say May was right to call a vote sooner rather than later, unemployment remains low, the housing market is steady, stock markets are near record highs and business activity continues to rise \u2013 albeit at a slower pace. The economy appears to have lost momentum but has comfortably avoided the recession some had predicted in the wake of the Brexit vote. Last week, the International Monetary Fund was forced to admit yet again that it had been too gloomy on the consequences of the Brexit vote as it revised up its UK growth forecast for the second time in three months. Writing in the Guardian, Andrew Sentance, a former member of the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee, said support for the UK from a strong global economy was being offset by domestic pressures. \u201cThere are two big themes which stand out from this month\u2019s data, and they show the UK being pulled in opposite directions by the global economy and consumer spending,\u201d said Sentance, a senior economic adviser at the consultancy PwC. \u201cWe should expect the consumer slowdown to dominate the growth picture over the course of this year ... GDP growth figures for the first quarter released at the end of this week are likely to confirm that the UK economy is already slowing.\u201d To gauge the impact of the Brexit vote on a monthly basis, the Guardian has chosen eight economic indicators, along with the value of the pound and the performance of the FTSE. The dashboard for April shows retail sales have dropped, inflation is at its highest for more than three years, wages are falling in real terms and Britain\u2019s trade performance has deteriorated. But unemployment remains low, house prices continue to edge up and businesses are expanding. The deficit of the public finances fell over the last year and the government hit its borrowing target. But the public finances were worse than market expectations for the latest month. Compared with economists\u2019 forecasts, there was a worse-than-expected performance in three of the eight categories. Two were better than expected, with three as forecast. Stock markets remain near record highs and the pound has been given a fillip by news of the election, with investors predicting the result will strengthen May\u2019s position in Brexit negotiations with her EU counterparts. But, compared with the day of last June\u2019s referendum, the pound is still down 14% against the US dollar and 10% against the euro. That weakness is now making itself felt in the real economy as imports become more expensive and shoppers are paying higher prices for a whole range of goods and services, from food to fuel. The pound effect has combined with higher global oil prices to lift inflation to a rate of 2.3% in February and March, above the Bank of England\u2019s 2% target. But while inflation is expected to climb higher, wage growth looks set to slow. Employers are grappling with higher costs that give them less leeway for pay rises and the government continues to implement a public sector pay freeze. The latest official figures show workers were already worse off in real terms in February as pay rose 1.9% on the year but inflation stood at 2.3%. That pay weakness was despite Britain\u2019s unemployment rate remaining at 4.7% \u2013 its joint lowest since 1975 \u2013 and continued reports of skills shortages. Reflecting tighter household budgets, retail sales volumes suffered their biggest drop in seven years over the opening months of 2017, dragging on the overall economy rather than acting as a driver of growth as they usually do. In other signs of the strains on consumers, there has been an increase in borrowing on credit cards while a key measure of what households have available to save has hit a record low. David Blanchflower, another former Bank of England policymaker, said consumer spending was being supported by people borrowing more and running down their savings but that could not last. \u201cSupport for Brexit is likely to be driven by how the economy performs and whether living standards hold up and they aren\u2019t,\u201d said Blanchflower, professor of economics at Dartmouth College in the US. \u201cI am hoping for some good economic news next month. I didn\u2019t see much of any this month.\u201d There have been upsides from a weaker pound, including an influx of foreign tourists splashing out in British shops, restaurants and hotels to take advantage of the relative strength in their own currencies. Exporters also report that the pound\u2019s drop has made their goods and services more competitive in overseas markets but the latest official trade figures were weaker than expected. That overseas boost was clear in a set of business surveys that are closely watched by investors and policymakers for early clues to GDP growth. But while activity has continued to expand according to those Markit/CIPS purchasing managers\u2019 indices (PMIs), their compilers say there has been a change of pace since last year and that GDP growth likely slowed to 0.4% in the first quarter of 2017 from 0.7% in the final three months of 2016. The first official snapshot of GDP growth in the opening months in the year is due on Friday and economists polled by Reuters also expect growth to slow to 0.4%.",

April verdict</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The economy appears to have lost momentum but has comfortably avoided the recession some had predicted in the wake of the Brexit vote. Last week, the International Monetary Fund was forced to admit yet again that it had been too gloomy on the consequences of the Brexit vote as it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/apr/18/imf-ratchets-up-uk-economic-growth-forecast-to-2\">revised up its UK growth forecast for the second time in three months</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/apr/25/two-big-themes-pulling-opposite-directions-experts-debate-data-brexit-watch\">Writing in the Guardian</a>, Andrew Sentance, a former member of the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee, said support for the UK from a strong global economy was being offset by domestic pressures.</p> <p>\u201cThere are two big themes which stand out from this month\u2019s data, and they show the UK being pulled in opposite directions by the global economy and consumer spending,\u201d said Sentance, a senior economic adviser at the consultancy PwC.</p> <p>\u201cWe should expect the consumer slowdown to dominate the growth picture over the course of this year ... GDP growth figures for the first quarter released at the end of this week are likely to confirm that the UK economy is already slowing.\u201d</p> <p>To gauge the impact of the Brexit vote on a monthly basis, the Guardian has chosen eight economic indicators, along with the value of the pound and the performance of the FTSE.<br></p> <p>The <a href=\"https://gu.com/p/69nb3\">dashboard for April</a> shows <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/apr/21/uk-retail-surge-brexit-comes-to-an-end-ons\">retail sales have dropped</a>, inflation is at its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/apr/11/uk-inflation-rate-stays-three-year-high\">highest for more than three years</a>, wages are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/apr/12/living-standards-fall-first-time-since-2014-uk-inflation-pay-growth\">falling in real terms</a> and Britain\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/apr/07/post-brexit-vote-surge-for-uk-economy-comes-to-an-end\">trade performance has deteriorated</a>. But unemployment remains low, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/apr/13/estate-agents-struggling-to-find-homes-to-sell-says-report\">house prices continue to edge up</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/apr/05/uk-services-sector-march-inflation\">businesses are expanding</a>. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2017/apr/25/world-stock-markets-hit-record-highs-uk-deficit-borrowing-live?page=with:block-58ff095ce4b0e1f174d40b4a#block-58ff095ce4b0e1f174d40b4a\">The deficit of the public finances fell over the last year</a> and the government hit its borrowing target. But the public finances were worse than market expectations for the latest month.</p> <p>Compared with economists\u2019 forecasts, there was a worse-than-expected performance in three of the eight categories. Two were better than expected, with three as forecast.</p> <p>Stock markets remain near record highs and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/apr/18/ftse-100-brexit-vote-election\">the pound has been given a fillip by news of the election</a>, with investors predicting the result will strengthen May\u2019s position in Brexit negotiations with her EU counterparts. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2017/04/index-html-zip/giv-3902yRguYzRszIsr/\" data-alt=\"CPI graph\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2017/04/index-html-zip/giv-3902yRguYzRszIsr/\">CPI graph</a> </figure>  <p>But, compared with the day of last June\u2019s referendum, the pound is still down 14% against the US dollar and 10% against the euro. That weakness is now making itself felt in the real economy as imports become more expensive and shoppers are paying higher prices for a whole range of goods and services, from food to fuel.</p> <p>The pound effect has combined with higher global oil prices to lift inflation to a rate of 2.3% in February and March, above the Bank of England\u2019s 2% target. </p> <p>But while inflation is expected to climb higher, wage growth looks set to slow. Employers are grappling with higher costs that give them less leeway for pay rises and the government continues to implement a public sector pay freeze. </p> <p>The latest official figures show workers were already worse off in real terms in February as pay rose 1.9% on the year but inflation stood at 2.3%. That pay weakness was despite Britain\u2019s unemployment rate remaining at 4.7% \u2013 its joint lowest since 1975 \u2013 and continued reports of skills shortages.</p> <p>Reflecting tighter household budgets, retail sales volumes suffered their biggest drop in seven years over the opening months of 2017, dragging on the overall economy rather than acting as a driver of growth as they usually do. In other signs of the strains on consumers, there has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/apr/04/bank-of-england-sounds-new-alarm-over-consumer-credit-binge\">an increase in borrowing on credit cards</a> while <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/mar/31/uk-households-savings-fall-record-low-warning-sign-economy\">a key measure of what households have available to save has hit a record low</a>.<br></p> <p>David Blanchflower, another former Bank of England policymaker, said consumer spending was being supported by people borrowing more and running down their savings but that could not last.</p> <p>\u201cSupport for Brexit is likely to be driven by how the economy performs and whether living standards hold up and they aren\u2019t,\u201d said Blanchflower, professor of economics at Dartmouth College in the US.<br></p> <p>\u201cI am hoping for some good economic news next month. I didn\u2019t see much of any this month.\u201d</p> <p>There have been upsides from a weaker pound, including an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/feb/17/fall-in-pound-after-brexit-vote-uk-break-overseas-visitors-record-ons-north-american-tourists\">influx of foreign tourists</a> splashing out in British shops, restaurants and hotels to take advantage of the relative strength in their own currencies. Exporters also report that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/apr/05/uk-services-sector-march-inflation\">the pound\u2019s drop has made their goods and services more competitive in overseas markets</a> but the latest official trade figures were weaker than expected.<br></p> <p>That overseas boost was clear in a set of business surveys that are closely watched by investors and policymakers for early clues to GDP growth. But while activity has continued to expand according to those Markit/CIPS purchasing managers\u2019 indices (PMIs), their compilers say there has been a change of pace since last year and that GDP growth likely slowed to 0.4% in the first quarter of 2017 from 0.7% in the final three months of 2016. </p> <p>The first official snapshot of GDP growth in the opening months in the year is due on Friday and economists polled by Reuters also expect growth to slow to 0.4%.</p>",

The Arnault family, which holds a controlling stake in LVMH, owns 74.1% of Christian Dior, one of the world\u2019s top fashion houses. The family said it wants to buy the remainder for \u20ac12bn, or \u20ac260 a share. It will then sell Christian Dior Couture to LVMH for \u20ac6.5bn. LVMH, the world\u2019s largest luxury company, owns Christian Dior perfumes and beauty after a deal in the 1960s to raise capital for the then-struggling brand. The latest transactions will bring the whole Christian Dior brand under one roof, from fashion to fragrances. Arnault, France\u2019s richest man and chief executive of LVMH, which was formed from the 1987 merger of fashion house Louis Vuitton with champagne and cognac producer Mo\u00ebt Hennessy, hailed the deal as an \u201cimportant milestone\u201d for the group. He said the transactions demonstrated his family\u2019s commitment to LVMH and would result in \u201cthe simplification of the structures, long requested by the market, and the strengthening of LVMH\u2019s fashion and leather goods division thanks to the acquisition of Christian Dior couture\u201d. The move was welcomed by analysts and investors, and LVMH shares rose more than 4% to \u20ac223.55 in morning trade on Tuesday. Luca Solca, the head of luxury goods at Exane BNP Paribas, said: \u201cIt adds a strong brand to the LVMH portfolio at a reasonable valuation.\u201d Paris-based Christian Dior has 198 stores worldwide including one in Mayfair, central London. It posted revenues of \u20ac2bn and underlying earnings of \u20ac418m last year. The fashion house was founded by the French designer Christian Dior in 1946 with backing from the cotton fabric magnate Marcel Boussac. It later branched out into perfume, watches, jewellery, shoes and accessories. His debut collection was quickly christened the \u201cnew look\u201d, with a calf-length full skirt, cinched waist and fuller bust. Dior\u2019s clothes were worn by stars such as Rita Hayworth, and he was invited to present the collection privately to the British royal family. He died in 1957.",

      "bodyText": "As we approach 100 days in, business still doesn\u2019t know quite what to make of Donald Trump. On the campaign trail he excoriated Wall Street and pledged to \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d of lobbyists. In office he has stuffed his cabinet full of gilded bankers and hidden the White House guest book so we will never find out who has his ear. He promised to slash environmental regulation (done), reassess the post-financial crash Dodd Frank financial regulations (doing) and to slash taxes on businesses (pending). All these things should be pro-business. \u201cBusiness likes to follow the path of least resistance,\u201d says Peter Henning, law professor and regulatory expert at Wayne State. \u201cHe campaigned as a populist president but I\u2019d say that so far the banks sure like him.\u201d But even more than tax cuts and deregulation, business likes certainty and here Trump\u2019s first 100 days suggest business is out of luck. Trump is also arguably the US\u2019s most protectionist president since Herbert Hoover, a view that may have got him elected but that sends the global elite of Davos into the horrors. Nor has the president been shy to name and shame those companies that offend him. Trump has used the bully pulpit (mostly via his Twitter account) to lambast companies including GM and Ford for their plans to manufacture overseas. He wiped $1bn, temporarily, off Boeing\u2019s value after threatening to cancel its contract to build the new Air Force One 747. Even the Kochs, usually every Republican president\u2019s favorite rightwing billionaires, aren\u2019t happy with Trump\u2019s tough talk on trade. The brothers recently financed ads attacking a \u201cborder adjustment tax\u201d on goods coming into the US that Trump wants to use to build his \u201cbig, beautiful wall\u201d to keep Mexicans out (you may remember it as the one Mexico was going to pay for). The Koch\u2019s ads claim US shoppers will end up paying for that tax in higher prices at Walmart etc. But having got off to a galvanizing start, there are some signs that Wall Street is no longer glued to Trump\u2019s every word. Repealing Obama rules is one thing Trump has done effectively, but drafting and passing his own \u2013 not so much. Talk of tax cuts last week did little for stock prices which rallied after his election (the Trump Bump), but peaked in March and have drifted down ever since. The administration\u2019s humiliating defeat, at the hands of its own party, over its plans to repeal and replace Obamacare have shown the limits of his authority. When Trump came out in support of Bill O\u2019Reilly, Fox News\u2019s fallen idol, O\u2019Reilly still lost his job. Already some business leaders, even those with terrible reputations (that\u2019s you Uber\u2019s Travis Kalanick) have dropped out of Trump\u2019s business advisory council, lest their proximity be read as approval. Thanks to the supreme court, corporations are people too and as the fight for equal bathroom rights for transgender people in North Carolina has shown, corporations are increasingly more liberal in their views than the Trump administration. On issues such as the environment, women\u2019s rights, immigration and the treatment of the LGBTQ community, it\u2019s not hard to see companies increasingly siding with consumers and activists against the Trump administration (especially if the president\u2019s poll numbers keep falling). But while the president may look less powerful 100 days on, business has not forgotten what Potus represents. Rihanna may have 71 million followers on Twitter compared with Trump\u2019s 6.6m but she doesn\u2019t have the nuclear codes. Foreign policy remains the great uncertainty as Trump exits his \u201choneymoon\u201d. He has softened the rhetoric on China but is still insisting on his border wall, has bombed Syria and made worrying noises about North Korea. One hundred days in, business may be taking Trump a little less seriously at home \u2013 for now, overseas issues look more worrying. All that could change in a tweet. This is a president who likes surprises, and business hates surprises.",

Trump is also arguably the US\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/29/smoot-hawley-tariffs-protectionism-donald-trump\">most protectionist president</a> since Herbert Hoover, a view that may have got him elected but that sends the global elite of Davos into the horrors.</p> <p>Nor has the president been shy to name and shame those companies that offend him. Trump has used the bully pulpit (mostly via his Twitter account) to lambast companies including GM and Ford for their plans to manufacture overseas. He wiped $1bn, temporarily, off Boeing\u2019s value after threatening to cancel its contract to build the new Air Force One 747.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/816260343391514624\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers-tax free across border.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/816260343391514624\">January 3, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Even the Kochs, usually every Republican president\u2019s favorite rightwing billionaires, aren\u2019t happy with Trump\u2019s tough talk on trade. The brothers recently financed ads attacking a \u201cborder adjustment tax\u201d on goods coming into the US that Trump wants to use to build his \u201cbig, beautiful wall\u201d to keep Mexicans out (you may remember it as the one <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/06/donald-trump-mexico-border-wall-congress-america-pay\">Mexico was going to pay for</a>). The Koch\u2019s ads claim US shoppers will end up paying for that tax in higher prices at Walmart etc.</p> <p>But having got off to a galvanizing start, there are some signs that Wall Street is no longer glued to Trump\u2019s every word. Repealing Obama rules is one thing Trump has done effectively, but drafting and passing his own \u2013 not so much. Talk of tax cuts last week did little for stock prices which rallied after his election (the Trump Bump), but peaked in March and have drifted down ever since.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/SenWarren/status/855825458440679424\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump\">@realDonaldTrump</a> .<a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump\">@realDonaldTrump</a>\u2019s actions in his first 100 days have shown his tough talk against Wall Street and big corporations was just that: all talk</p>&mdash; Elizabeth Warren (@SenWarren) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SenWarren/status/855825458440679424\">April 22, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>The administration\u2019s humiliating defeat, at the hands of its own party, over its plans to repeal and replace Obamacare have shown the limits of his authority. When Trump came out in support of Bill O\u2019Reilly, Fox News\u2019s fallen idol, O\u2019Reilly still lost his job. Already some business leaders, even those with terrible reputations (that\u2019s you <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/mar/21/uber-ceo-travis-kalanick-defense-arianna-huffington-executives\">Uber\u2019s Travis Kalanick</a>) have dropped out of Trump\u2019s business advisory council, lest their proximity be read as approval.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2017/jan/20/donald-trump-first-100-days-president-daily-updates\">Donald Trump's first 100 days as president \u2013 daily updates</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Thanks to the supreme court, corporations are people too and as the fight for equal bathroom rights for transgender people in North Carolina has shown, corporations are increasingly more liberal in their views than the Trump administration. On issues such as the environment, women\u2019s rights, immigration and the treatment of the LGBTQ community, it\u2019s not hard to see companies increasingly siding with consumers and activists against the Trump administration (especially if the president\u2019s poll numbers keep falling).</p> <p>But while the president may look less powerful 100 days on, business has not forgotten what Potus represents. Rihanna may have 71 million followers on Twitter compared with Trump\u2019s 6.6m but she doesn\u2019t have the nuclear codes. Foreign policy remains the great uncertainty as Trump exits his \u201choneymoon\u201d. He has softened the rhetoric on China but is still insisting on his border wall, has bombed Syria and made worrying noises about North Korea. One hundred days in, business may be taking Trump a little less seriously at home \u2013 for now, overseas issues look more worrying. All that could change in a tweet. This is a president who likes surprises, and business hates surprises.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Canadian company Tim Hortons is to open its first UK coffee shop in May, entering the crowded but still growing British market for food and drink on the go. Promising to bring its \u201csignature coffee, delicious food and Canadian charm\u201d to the UK, the chain\u2019s first UK coffee shop \u2013 also its first in Europe \u2013 will be on Argyle Street in central Glasgow, with further outlets planned in other city centre locations around the country. The company is seeking to cash in on the UK\u2019s fast-growing coffee market \u2013 where it faces intense competition from major players such as Starbucks and Costa, independent chains and low-cost operators. Tim Hortons \u2013 known for its red and white vintage-style branding \u2013 was founded in 1964 by its namesake (Miles \u201cTim\u201d Horton), a professional ice hockey player who wanted to create cafes where everyone would feel at home. Since then the brand has grown to become an ingrained part of Canadian culture, dominating its home market with locations in nearly every city and small town. It claims eight out of 10 cups of coffee sold across Canada are served at Tim Hortons, which is owned by Restaurant Brands International. A recent report from Mintel showed the UK retail coffee market was worth \u00a3137m in 1997, but by 2016 it had ballooned to an estimated \u00a33.4bn. Almost \u00a31bn of this growth has come since 2011, making the UK an attractive proposition for international coffee shop chains. Jonny Forsyth, Mintel\u2019s global drinks analyst, said Tim Hortons faced challenges in terms of timing. \u201cCompetition has become incredibly intense and there are now simply too many brands in competition with each other,\u201d he said. \u201cFor example, Starbucks has announced disappointing results recently and is under threat from the growth of trendy independent coffee shops at the top end and also lower-priced, non-specialist operators such as JD Wetherspoon and Greggs. \u201cWe are also starting to see inflation outstripping wage growth, which means UK consumers will have less disposable income in the lead-up to Brexit.\u201d Tim Hortons president Elias D\u00edaz Ses\u00e9 said: \u201cGreat Britain is a nation of coffee lovers, so we\u2019re confident Tim Hortons will continue to be a leader in the quick service restaurant sector across the pond.\u201d Forsyth said a major obstacle for Tim Hortons was that \u201cit is little known outside of its native Canada, something which explains why it also struggled to make inroads on the US coffee market in recent years\u201d. Tim Hortons\u2019 signature freshly brewed drip coffee \u2013 medium roast and guaranteed to be served no more than 20 minutes after brewing \u2013 will be on sale in the UK. But British palates may find another Tim Hortons favourite in Canada, the \u201cdouble-double\u201d coffee served with two portions of cream and two sugars, a step too far. \u2022 This article was amended on 26 April 2017. An earlier version referred to the Tim Hortons coffee shop in Glasgow as its \u201cfirst foray in Europe\u201d; to clarify, its products have previously been available in self-serve kiosks at Spar stores in Ireland.",
