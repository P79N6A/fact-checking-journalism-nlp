      "bodyText": "Spain's precarious economic situation has worsened after the ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor's downgraded the country's debt and warned that its recession was likely to deepen by the end of the year. S&amp;P cut the rating on Spain's debt mountain by two notches, from A to BBB+. The downgrade is expected to push up the cost of borrowing immediately, as investors become increasingly worried over Madrid's inability to cut spending without sending its beleaguered economy into a deeper recession. European leaders have feared that investors, who have watched the unfolding euro crisis over the last two years, would withdraw their support for Spain in response to the increased risk that it will be forced to accept a multi-billion-euro rescue package from Brussels. S&amp;P said: \"The downgrade reflects our view of mounting risks to Spain's net general government debt as a share of GDP in light of the contracting economy, in particular due to the deterioration in the budget deficit trajectory for 2011-2015, in contrast with our previous projections, and the increasing likelihood that the government will need to provide further fiscal support to the banking sector. \"Consequently, we think risks are rising to fiscal performance and flexibility, and to the sovereign debt burden, particularly in light of the increased contingent liabilities that could materialise on the government's balance sheet,\" it said. The ratings agency, which has already cut Spain's debt rating once this year, put a negative outlook on the credit with a view to further downgrades if the situation fails to improve. Moody's rates Spain one notch higher at A3 with a negative outlook, and Fitch Ratings has it two notches higher at A, also with a negative outlook. Spain has rapidly become the weakest link in the eurozone after Italy succeeded in calming fears that it stood on the edge of bankruptcy. Speculation that several of Spain's banks will need to be rescued is a key concern following the property crash and a dramatic rise in unemployment that has dramatically increased the scale of bad debts. A report by Spain's central bank spooked the markets last week after it revealed that the amount of bad loans on the books of Spanish banks has risen to an 18-year high of 8.15% in February and accounted for \u20ac143.8bn (\u00a3117.7bn) of their outstanding \u20ac1.76tn of loans. Spanish banks were one of the chief beneficiaries of the European Central Bank's \u20ac350bn loan scheme to rescue the eurozone's weakest banks. Much of the money borrowed by eurozone banks has been lent to governments and been used as short-term financing to replace funds usually provided by private investors. Spanish banks own around \u20ac200bn of Spanish sovereign debt. So far, the struggling rightwing administration of Mariano Rajoy has dismissed concerns that Madrid could be forced to plead for funds from Brussels, despite wrestling with declining tax receipts and conflicts with regional government that are seeking to block spending cuts. The Madrid stock market has fallen more than 15% in recent months amid concerns that Rajoy is being forced to adopt further austerity measures that will hurt the economy and worsen unemployment. The economy is expected to shrink by as much as 2.7% this year, and there is precious little prospect of growth if the government is forced to raise taxes to meet this year's 5.3% deficit goal and the target of 3% in 2013. In a desperate bid to fill the exchequer's coffers, Rajoy recently announced a tax amnesty that he expects to top \u20ac25bn, generating a meagre \u20ac2.5bn in receipts. The ECB added to concern that Europe's banking sector is increasingly prone to collapse after it called on authorities to set up a body to manage bank rescues in the eurozone. The message marked the bank's strongest intervention yet in the debate on whether the costs of bailing out troubled banks should be shared. The ECB said there were 36 banks vulnerable to collapse across the currency zone. \"The case for strengthening banking supervision and resolution at a euro-area level has become much clearer [as a result of the crisis],\" ECB president Mario Draghi said. \"Work on this would be most helpful at the current juncture.\"",

Sued for running up bills at the group's hotels of almost \u00a3300,000, Quinlan claimed this was part of a campaign orchestrated by McKillen. \"Details of the legal action were leaked to the press to embarrass me.\" Quinlan said he was further embarrassed by a separate joint venture with McKillen, where the two men had invested along with Bono and the Edge in the Clarence hotel in Dublin. McKillen, he said, had attempted to arranged for him and the rock star shareholders to charge \"penal\" interest of 12.5% to Quinlan, who could not otherwise meet the terms of a proposed cash call on investors. \"I took this to be a tremendous insult from Mr McKillen \u2013 he was trying to oppress me. I do not believe Bono or the Edge were behind this \u2013 this was McKillen's doing.\" The case continues.",

Whitbread, which owns the Premier Inn and Costa Coffee chains, is pressing ahead with an ambitious UK hotel and coffee-shop opening programme that will create 10,000 jobs, despite the country having tipped back into recession. Chief executive Andy Harrison said the economy had been \"going sideways for a while\" but that Whitbread was still prospering, with profits up 13% to \u00a3305.8m in the past year.

      "bodyText": "A sudden burst of shareholder activism appears to been unleashed at a wide range of underperforming companies. AstraZeneca's boardroom coup is the latest illustration of shareholders exerting their influence to demand change. Chief executive David Brennan announced his retirement and chairman Louis Schweitzer bowed out three months early after investor pressure, even though Brennan insisted the decision to go was his own. In the midst of the annual meeting season, a number of FTSE 100 companies have already seen rebellions against their pay policies \u2013 and more are expected in the weeks ahead. In the US, investors are proving to be unusually hostile towards big pay deals and even Germany's biggest bank, Deutsche, is in the firing line of some shareholders. Barclays annual meeting on Friday will provide the latest test of shareholders' willingness to confront issues at companies they believe are not providing them with large enough returns. Investors cite a number of reasons for what appears to be behind a surge in protests, including weak economic growth and poor performance by companies \u2013 as well as political pressure on investors, particularly in the UK, to demand more in turn from companies. \"In a world where returns to investors are hard to come by, investors are now ensuring they are working their portfolios harder than they might have done historically,\" said Robert Talbut, chief investment officer at Royal London Asset Management. Investor advisory group Pirc reckons that the rebellion at US bank Citi, and the revolt expected at Barclays on Friday, would have been unthinkable five years ago. \"When companies were making a lot of money, investors weren't so fussed about executive pay,\" Pirc said. But, five years on from the banking crisis, executive pay has continued to rise while returns to investors have fallen. Among the companies feeling the heat have been: \u2022 Citigroup, whose shareholders rejected a plan to pay chief executive Vikram Pandit almost $10m. Pandit had been taking a $1-a-year salary since the banking crisis. \u2022 Smith &amp; Nephew, where about 30% of investors at the FTSE 100 medical devices company failed to endorse the company's remuneration report. \u2022 Capital Shopping Centres, where nearly 30% voted against the remuneration report at this week's annual meeting. CSC holds big stakes in malls including Manchester's Trafford Centre and the Metrocentre in Gateshead. \u2022 GE in the US, where protesters were escorted out of the annual meeting in Detroit this week shouting \"pay your fair share\" in reference to reports that the company had paid no corporation tax. \u2022 Deutsche Bank, which is facing a protest from an investor group led by Hermes Equity Ownership Services over the supervisory board's performance over the past year. Louise Rouse, head of engagement at the investment campaign group Fair Pensions, was at AstraZeneca's annual meeting on Thursday and expects to attend around 20 annual meetings a year. She believes shareholders could still do more. \"I think we are seeing some momentum on some issues but I wouldn't say that shareholders are dealing with all the issues,\" she said. Rouse said there may be signs that investors are becoming more strident. Many used to merely abstain from voting when wishing to indicate their displeasure with underperforming companies or overpaid boards, whereas now they simply vote \"no\". However, Sarah Wilson, chief executive of the corporate governance consultancy Manifest, produces data that shows that the level of protest, while on the rise, is still relatively low. In the year that shareholders were first handed an advisory vote on pay a decade ago, the average level of dissent for remuneration across the FTSE 100 was 17%. But this had fallen back to 6% by 2005, rising again after the 2008 banking crisis. Dissent then slipped back again, before starting its latest rise. With protests still on such a small scale, there is also the question of whether companies take much notice of their shareholders at all. At Capital Shopping Centres, for instance, this was the third year in a row that investors had staged a protest.",

Among the companies feeling the heat have been:</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Citigroup,</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/apr/17/citigroup-shareholders-reject-ceo-pay\" title=\"\">whose shareholders rejected a plan </a>to pay chief executive Vikram Pandit almost $10m. Pandit had been taking a $1-a-year salary since the banking crisis.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Smith &amp; Nephew</strong>, where about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/apr/12/pirc-smith-nephew-pay-plans\" title=\"\">30% of investors</a> at the FTSE 100 medical devices company failed to endorse the company's remuneration report.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Capital Shopping Centres</strong>, where nearly <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/apr/25/csc-investors-executive-pay\" title=\"\">30% voted against the remuneration report</a> at this week's annual meeting. CSC holds big stakes in malls including Manchester's Trafford Centre and the Metrocentre in Gateshead.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>GE</strong> in the US, where protesters were escorted out of the annual meeting in Detroit this week shouting \"pay your fair share\" in reference to reports that the company had paid no corporation tax.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Deutsche Bank</strong>, which is facing a protest from an investor group led by Hermes Equity Ownership Services over the supervisory board's performance over the past year.</p> <p>Louise Rouse, head of engagement at the investment campaign group Fair Pensions, was at AstraZeneca's annual meeting on Thursday and expects to attend around 20 annual meetings a year. She believes shareholders could still do more. \"I think we are seeing some momentum on some issues but I wouldn't say that shareholders are dealing with all the issues,\" she said.</p> <p>Rouse said there may be signs that investors are becoming more strident. Many used to merely abstain from voting when wishing to indicate their displeasure with underperforming companies or overpaid boards, whereas now they simply vote \"no\".</p> <p>However, Sarah Wilson, chief executive of the corporate governance consultancy Manifest, produces data that shows that the level of protest, while on the rise, is still relatively low. In the year that shareholders were first handed an advisory vote on pay a decade ago, the average level of dissent for remuneration across the FTSE 100 was 17%. But this had fallen back to 6% by 2005, rising again after the 2008 banking crisis. Dissent then slipped back again, before starting its latest rise.</p> <p>With protests still on such a small scale, there is also the question of whether companies take much notice of their shareholders at all. At Capital Shopping Centres, for instance, this was the third year in a row that investors had staged a protest.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Barclays will apologise on Friday to shareholders for the bank's handling of the \u00a317m pay package awarded to its chief executive, Bob Diamond. At what is expected to be a stormy annual meeting at the Royal Festival Hall in London, Barclays chairman Marcus Agius will acknowledge that the bank should have communicated more effectively with shareholders, who are also angry about the low levels of dividends they receive from the bank compared with the amount paid out in bonuses. Agius will say that the bank \"recognises and accepts that remuneration levels across the industry have to adjust to the new reality of higher capital and lower returns for the sector\" and insist that the bank will be able to \"realign\" the share of income in favour of shareholders. \"Evidently, we have not done a good enough job in articulating our case: on some matters we should have communicated earlier and more clearly,\" Agius will say. \"For this I apologise and I assure you that in the future we will be engaging differently and more purposefully with shareholders in order to ensure that we obtain a broader level of support on remuneration policy and practice.\" The scale of the protest will be known once the annual meeting ends but is expected to be larger than the 10% of votes registered against remuneration policies last year. The terms of Diamond's bonus were tweaked last week in an effort to quell any shareholder rebellion, but no changes were made to the \u00a35.7m tax bill the bank paid to relocate the American-born banker from New York to London to take on the top job in January 2011. Half of the \u00a32.7 million awarded to Diamond in shares for 2011 will pay out only if the bank's return on equity (a measure of shareholder performance) is higher than the cost of equity (a measure of the cost of doing business for Barclays). At the end of 2011, return on equity stood at 6.3%, although \u2013 according to a trading update \u2013 it had risen to 12.2% in the first quarter of 2012. The latter figure is higher than the bank's 11.5% cost of equity, although Diamond has committed himself to achieving a 13% target. The bank revealed on Thursday that it was taking an extra \u00a3300m hit for compensation claims from mis-sold payment protection insurance (PPI), in a move that suggests rivals such as Royal Bank of Scotland may also have to increase their provisions for similar claims. The extra provision pushed the bank to a \u00a3475 million statutory loss once a reversal in the value of buying back its own debt \u2013 a calculation that is required by accounting rules \u2013 was included. Stripping out the additional \u00a32.6 billion cost of buying back its own debt and the PPI charge, profits were up 22% at \u00a32.4 million and were higher than had been expected.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The chief executive of drugs group AstraZeneca, David Brennan, quit on Thursday after more than six years in the post, following pressure from shareholders who had called for a radical shake-up of the group's top management. The boardroom reshuffle, which also includes the early departure of the pharmaceuticals company's chairman, came just hours before Britain's second-largest drugmaker held its annual shareholder meeting. While the company would not comment about his retirement package, which is still being finalised, Brennan could walk away with about \u00a35m \u2013 after receiving more than \u00a39m in pay, perks and shares last year. Shares in the group, which also announced a 38% drop in three-month profits to \u00a31.34bn and a reduction in its 2012 earnings target, were the biggest fallers in the FTSE 100, down 6.1% at \u00a326.66, wiping \u00a32.2bn from the company's market value. Brennan will be replaced temporarily by finance director Simon Lowth from 1 June. Former Volvo boss Leif Johansson will take over as chairman from Louis Schweitzer, 69, on the same day \u2013 three months earlier than planned. Johansson will then lead the hunt for a permanent successor to Brennan. Headhunters Spencer Stuart have been hired to scout out internal and external candidates. Brennan, 58, said he had been contemplating his departure for some time and told the board formally of his intention to quit on Wednesday, following private conversations with the chairman. The board then decided to accelerate the process by appointing Lowth as interim CEO, a move backed by Brennan. Both Brennan and Schweitzer were reportedly encouraged to retire earlier than planned by non-executive directors on the board. However, Brennan insisted: \"The decision to retire was entirely my decision. I've been contemplating it for a while. It was time to give someone else the chance to take the company to the next level.\" He said he wanted to spend more time with his family (he is married with four grown-up children and has six grandchildren) and to \"figure out ways to influence healthcare from a different position\". At the annual meeting in London, shareholders demanded to know the real story behind Brennan's departure, while the board sat poker-faced. Schweitzer said: \"We have not ousted David Brennan. He has decided to retire.\" Several investors were concerned that he could get a huge payoff, following his big payday last year. Brennan's \u00a39m remuneration last year included \u00a35.6m of share awards. While the group said his retirement package was still being negotiated, he could be in line for a golden goodbye equal to his annual \u00a3997,000 salary plus bonuses worth \u00a31.4m and share options worth about \u00a32.2m. He also has share awards worth millions more, which will be paid out pro-rated for his shortened term in office. His pension pot is worth $23m (\u00a314m), or \u00a3978,000 a year, and he has already received share awards that vested earlier this year worth a total \u00a34.1m based on Thursday's share price. Some 8.6% of investors voted against AstraZeneca's 2011 remuneration at Thursday's meeting \u2013 a similar level to previous years. John Farmer, a private shareholder, told the board during the annual meeting: \"It seems a lot is being paid for very little \u2013 by which I mean paltry shareholder returns.\" Another private investor told the Guardian she was \"appalled\" that Brennan had pocketed such a big package last year after so many people got made redundant: \"I thought it was obscene\". Keith Doyle, another individual investor, chipped in: \"He's controversial because of the amount of bonus he's taken \u2026 [His strategy] hasn't worked out too well. It's quite sensible for him to step down.\" An American who began his career as a sales representative for Merck in 1975, Brennan had come under increasing pressure from investors as he made little headway in replenishing AstraZeneca's rapidly dwindling pipeline of new products. He restricted himself to small acquisitions, partnerships and licensing deals after his one big acquisition \u2013 the 2007 purchase of US biotech firm MedImmune for $15.6bn (\u00a39.63bn) \u2013 turned out to be an overpriced flop. Brennan stepped up dealmaking in recent weeks, unveiling a collaboration with Amgen on five products to treat inflammatory diseases, and agreeing the takeover of gout drug developer Ardea this week. City analysts expect even more dealmaking under the new leadership, with fresh talk that AstraZeneca could snap up its partner, Forest Laboratories. Shareholders stood up to criticise the Ardea acquisition at a time when the company is cutting thousands of its own research staff. Martin Symons said: \"What future is there for British industry if this is happening? This company will not survive if it does not do its in-house research.\" Lowth, who joined AstraZeneca from Scottish Power five years ago without any pharmaceuticals experience, reiterated the company's strategy of small deals and collaborations, rather than large-scale acquisitions. At this time of year, the board always carries out a strategy review, so a shift under the new leadership is possible in the second half of the year. \"We're navigating a difficult period with patent expiration,\" said Lowth, adding that the next two quarters would be even tougher. Many of AstraZeneca's bestselling products, , have come off patent and face competition from cheaper alternatives. Two other major products \u2013 heartburn pill Nexium and heart drug Crestor \u2013 will lose their protection in 2014 and 2016 respectively. Brennan, one of the longest serving chief executives in the pharmaceutical industry, was expected to step down by the time of his 60th birthday next year. Miles White at Abbott is the only chief executive of a major pharmaceutical company who has been in place longer.",

      "bodyText": "Shell will not be joining David Cameron's crusade to attract private sector investment into creating a North Sea wind revolution despite its commitment to turbines in the US. Simon Henry, the company's finance director, said Shell \"can't make the numbers\" add up to justify building offshore windfarms. That contrasts with onshore turbines in America where it controls almost 1 gigawatt of wind power. The British government should support an industry that is \"already successful\" \u2013 such as oil and gas \u2013 as much as chase a renewable power sector that is still trying to become profitable, Henry added.

In March 2010, the Bank told major financial institutions and cash machine operators to increase the proportion of \u00a35 notes issued at ATMs. It revealed on Thursday that they have exceeded the minimum target set, and that fivers now make up 1.5% of notes dispensed by value. Almost \u00a3200m of \u00a35 notes are now dispensed by ATMs each month, and by March this year more than 5,000 cash machines were giving out fivers, compared to just 670 in 2009.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Shell has produced a barnstorming profit performance in the first quarter of the year, making more than \u00a32m an hour on the back of soaring crude prices. The oil group's chief executive, Peter Voser, said investors and customers stood to gain as the money helped keep up dividend payments and pay for schemes to ensure steady petrol supplies. Shell is to sell off $4bn (\u00a32.5bn) worth of lower-performing assets this year, almost double what it previously planned, in an attempt to squeeze more profits out of its oil and gas business. Shares in the company rose more than 3% to close at \u00a321.95\u00bd as the City reacted positively to an 11% increase in first-quarter earnings of $7.3bn on the same period last year and a small rise in the dividend. By contrast its US rival ExxonMobil saw an 11% slump in its first quarter profits to $9.45bn. Exxon, the world's largest independent oil company, blamed lower Opec quotas for a 5% fall in production. Wall Street was surprised by the relatively poor performance and the Exxon stock price fell significantly. Mindful that Shell is making money hand-over-fist when motorists and others are being squeezed by high fuel costs and financial hardship, Voser said: \"Our profits pay for Shell's dividends and substantial investments in new energy projects, to ensure affordable, reliable energy supplies for our customers, which create value for our shareholders.\" Figures released by the company the day before showed that Shell paid $1.2bn in income tax to the British government and raised a further $17.7bn for the Treasury through the sale of petrol. Voser said the company had sold $2.4bn worth of assets in the first three months of the year alone. Some of the assets disposed of in the first quarter included offshore stakes in Brazil and Australia plus retail petrol stations in north America and a liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) operation in Malaysia. These moves would be \"enhancing our financial flexibility and capital efficiency, and unlocking new growth potential\", said Voser, as he outlined projects that had recently come on stream, such as its Pearl gas-to-liquids scheme in Qatar. Shell said that it had also spent more than $600m on new offshore acreage in the UK North Sea, Nova Scotia and Tanzania, the latter part of a new oil boom in southern and eastern Africa. This week Shell received the backing of directors at Cove Energy for its \u00a31.1bn bid to acquire the exploration business, which has an important 8.5% stake in a potentially massive gas find off Mozambique. The acquisition has raised worries in some sections of the City that Shell could be profligate with all the money that it is pulling in. Peter Hutton, equity analyst with RBC Capital Markets, said in a research note that \"the focus will remain on Shell's capital discipline, a day after it raised its bid for Cove to $2bn (including carry of the capital gains) without indicating an increase in the dividend\". Simon Henry, the finance director of Shell, said that the company was also planning to explore in a \"potentially very interesting\" undrilled deepwater basin off the coast of South Africa in the hope of finding some kind of connection with the huge discoveries made further north, in locations such as Angola. Gas, which is viewed as a cleaner substitute for coal as fuel in power stations, has become an increasing focus for both Shell and other big oil companies. Liquefied natural gas sales volumes at Shell rose by 17% to more than 5m tonnes in the first three months of the year as new supplies came out of Qatar and Nigeria. Henry announced that Shell was also considering the construction of a new gas-to-liquids project, possibly in the US, in Louisiana or Texas, emulating the Qatar facility. The company would be seeking to take advantage of the \"arbitrage\" differential between very cheap US natural gas prices, which have been brought down by shale gas finds, and very high oil prices. Shell would hope, in effect, to refine cheap gas and turn it into much more highly priced liquid fuel. Henry, although enthusiastic about the project, nonetheless insisted that a final investment decision over it was \"some way off\". The Anglo-Dutch oil company has also recently revealed that it is pursuing shale gas and shale oil opportunities in China, where it believes there could exist a massive home market if extraction can happen in the right quantities and at the right price.",

Some of the assets disposed of in the first quarter included offshore stakes in Brazil and Australia plus retail petrol stations in north America and a liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) operation in Malaysia.</p> <p>These moves would be \"enhancing our financial flexibility and capital efficiency, and unlocking new growth potential\", said Voser, as he outlined projects that had recently come on stream, such as its Pearl gas-to-liquids scheme in Qatar.</p> <p>Shell said that it had also spent more than $600m on new offshore acreage in the UK North Sea, Nova Scotia and Tanzania, the latter part of a new oil boom in southern and eastern Africa.</p> <p>This week Shell received the backing of directors at Cove Energy for its \u00a31.1bn bid to acquire the exploration business, which has an important 8.5% stake in a potentially massive gas find off Mozambique.</p> <p>The acquisition has raised worries in some sections of the City that Shell could be profligate with all the money that it is pulling in.</p> <p>Peter Hutton, equity analyst with RBC Capital Markets, said in a research note that \"the focus will remain on Shell's capital discipline, a day after it raised its bid for Cove to $2bn (including carry of the capital gains) without indicating an increase in the dividend\".</p> <p>Simon Henry, the finance director of Shell, said that the company was also planning to explore in a \"potentially very interesting\" undrilled deepwater basin off the coast of South Africa in the hope of finding some kind of connection with the huge discoveries made further north, in locations such as Angola.</p> <p>Gas, which is viewed as a cleaner substitute for coal as fuel in power stations, has become an increasing focus for both Shell and other big oil companies. Liquefied natural gas sales volumes at Shell rose by 17% to more than 5m tonnes in the first three months of the year as new supplies came out of Qatar and Nigeria.</p> <p>Henry announced that Shell was also considering the construction of a new gas-to-liquids project, possibly in the US, in Louisiana or Texas, emulating the Qatar &#xa0;facility.</p> <p>The company would be seeking to take advantage of the \"arbitrage\" differential between very cheap US natural gas prices, which have been brought down by shale gas finds, and very high oil prices. Shell would hope, in effect, to refine cheap gas and turn it into much more highly priced liquid fuel. Henry, although enthusiastic about the project, nonetheless insisted that a final investment decision over it was \"some way off\".</p> <p>The Anglo-Dutch oil company has also recently revealed that it is pursuing shale gas and shale oil opportunities in China, where it believes there could exist a massive home market if extraction can happen in the right quantities and at the right price.</p>",

They are cooked in small batches to make sure they don't hang around on the shop counter for long.

    "webTitle": "Boeing's Dreamliner comes closer to reality for its eager British customers", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "For a man who has waited so long for his order to arrive, Virgin Atlantic chief Steve Ridgway is remarkably sanguine in the cockpit of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner as it taxies towards the runway. The 15 planes Virgin signed up for five years ago were expected last summer. They are now promised for delivery in 2014, making this week's spin in the skies above Gatwick a tiny amuse-bouche in the airline's potential $8bn menu. \"There will be major plane spotters here,\" Ridgway says, even on this grey, rainy day. \"They turn up for easyJet, so this...\" The sight of the Dreamliner in action has been eagerly awaited in Britain, where the plane has spent the last week of its global promotional tour. That is not just because of the orders from three airlines, nor just for the aficionados, but also because UK suppliers have contributed a large chunk of Boeing's revolutionary carbon fibre aircraft, up to 25% of it by value. That includes control systems from Wolverhampton, pilot seats from Southend, and, above all, Rolls-Royce engines from Derby. Passengers will doubtless appreciate the plane's showier features \u2013 bigger windows, with electronic dimmers instead of shutters, the more comfortable cabin pressures and the range of ambient lighting. Environmentalists and those living within earshot of an airport will prefer the cleaner, quieter profile. But airlines will most of all appreciate the words of Randy Tinseth, a Boeing vice president: \"This will deliver double-digit improvements in operating costs.\" Ridgway agrees: \"When fuel is costing $120 a barrel, and we want to do what we can to reduce carbon emissions, this plane can't come soon enough.\" Quieter planes are also cheaper planes, because landing charges pegged to noise at airports. The Dreamliner is by no means silent \u2013 in fact, as one Virgin director comments discreetly, a truly quiet plane would open up a host of onboard problems with hundreds of passengers' conversations (or worse) reverberating in a confined space. But the noise on take-off feels dramatically lower and, with a light load, we are almost imperceptibly \u2013 and disappointingly for any planespotters \u2013 lifted up into the clouds while only halfway along the runway. The Virgin boss, who first joined the company after designing Richard Branson's Challenger powerboats in the 1980s, clearly appreciates the plane's design. \"The 747 was a step change a generation ago, and this aircraft is the same. It's just breaking with most of the conventions around how you build aircraft, and what you're seeking. The level of performance and improvement is really significant and that's why it's important for the industry.\" An 18-hour, 8,500-mile range makes direct geographical leaps such as Manchester to western Australia technically feasible \u2013 and this on a plane half the size of its great rival, the Airbus A380. The economics of the 787 thus open up new potential long-haul routes, without the need to get so many passengers on board. Those passengers will benefit not only from the bigger windows (although a wider wing will disrupt more views), but cleaner air filtering and higher humidity levels, which should lessen the physical drag of air travel. Boeing also trumpets the lighting system, which can, it says, combat jetlag. It is demonstrated somewhere over the East Midlands on our flight when one section of the cabin is darkened remotely, then bathed in a velvet red, the calming hue of a late sitting in the House of Lords. In the midst of this uber-modern interior, it's a surprise to spot an ashtray in the toilet door \u2013 sleek and minimalist, but an ashtray nonetheless. David Longridge of Boeing explains: \"It dates back to the days when everyone smoked and the regulations just live on.\" But he concedes that should any miscreant light up, \"it's really important that they have somewhere to stub it out\". Virgin is one of three UK airlines to have bought in: British Airways has ordered 24 planes, while the less celebrated Thomson Airways, whose parent TUI has ordered 13 with an option on 13 more, will be the first in Britain to fly the Dreamliner, as early as next year. Thomson boss Chris Browne says: \"Our biggest source of complaints was comfort, legroom and entertainment on long-haul holidays, so we had to do something. It was a scary decision, but man, are we glad.\" Having taken the plunge as only the third customer to commit, she says Thomson \"got a fantastic deal from Boeing. I wouldn't like to buy it today \u2013 and I love shopping.\" She believes the Dreamliner will be a great draw for holiday customers, though they plan to put only a small premium on routes it flies \u2013 around \u00a310 for a long-haul flight. The other airlines are tight-lipped about exactly how and where they will use the Dreamliner \u2013 perhaps still beset by doubts that production will meet the promised schedule, given the three- to four-year delays they have already experienced. However, IAG chief executive Willie Walsh promised it would \"power British Airways' expansion into Asia\". Ridgway says Latin America is on Virgin's mind. Rio de Janeiro, for business and leisure, may prove a perfect fit for a new Dreamliner route: \"It's long been high on our list.\" Virgin, which like BA has also invested in Airbuses during the long Boeing delay, will time a relaunch of its in-flight offering with the Dreamliner coming into service in 2014. \"At the end of the day, all airlines are flying the same aircraft. There will be many airlines flying this. So we need to provide something different so passengers choose to fly us.\" The clouds part long enough for us to spot the south coast, and we are back on what feels a smooth, quiet descent \u2013 aided through the bumps, say Boeing's technical staff, by new \"smoother ride\" technology. The pilot's verdict? \"It's easy to fly, a beautiful plane, even in all this weather,\" says Randy Neville. \"It's one of the quietest flight decks I've ever been in.\" For Ridgway, \"it's fantastic to see it flying. Now it's up to us to do our bit.\" \u2022 This article was amended on 27 April 2012. The original referred to the first sight of the Dreamliner in Britain. This has been corrected.",

      "standfirst": "Predictions of economic growth are supposed to be 'seasonally adjusted', but it's astonishing how many economists miss context", 
      "body": "<p>After touting the <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-04-26/bernanke-signals-further-easing-unlikely-as-outlook-improves.html\">economy's strong growth over the last three months</a>, we are now seeing news reports warning that the <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-500395_162-57420901/durable-goods-report-shows-economy-is-slowing/\">economy is actually weaker than we thought</a>. No doubt, the double-dippers will soon emerge from underneath the bridge to warn us of the economic calamity than lies just around the corner.</p> <p>The problem in this picture is that these analysts are worrying about the weather, literally. The weather can have a substantial effect on the economy. Much of this effect is entirely predictable. We know that every summer, tens of millions of people will take vacations and go to resort locations creating jobs in hotels, restaurants, and other vacation-related industries.</p> <p>To take account of these effects, we seasonally adjust our data. This way, it does not look like the economy is experiencing a boom every spring as warm-weather jobs start to appear and entering a recession as they disappear in the fall.</p> <p>However, there is also the impact of weather that is better or worse than normal. Last winter was unusually mild across the US northeast and midwest. There were few serious snowstorms or bouts of frigid weather. This makes a big difference for the economy because factors that would typically slow the economy were not present. </p> <p>Ordinarily, construction sites would be closed for at least a few days in these regions because of the bad weather. Also, starts of many construction projects would be put off until the weather had warmed up.</p> <p>In addition, people will be more likely to go out shopping on a relatively warm winter day than in a snowstorm or subzero weather. This means that they would be more likely to go to a mall to buy small items like shoes and clothes. They would also be more likely to shop for bigger items like a car or house. And they would be more likely to go out to restaurants for meals when the weather is good.</p> <p>For these reasons, the data in the winter months was better than would otherwise have been the case.

      "bodyText": "After touting the economy's strong growth over the last three months, we are now seeing news reports warning that the economy is actually weaker than we thought. No doubt, the double-dippers will soon emerge from underneath the bridge to warn us of the economic calamity than lies just around the corner. The problem in this picture is that these analysts are worrying about the weather, literally. The weather can have a substantial effect on the economy. Much of this effect is entirely predictable. We know that every summer, tens of millions of people will take vacations and go to resort locations creating jobs in hotels, restaurants, and other vacation-related industries. To take account of these effects, we seasonally adjust our data. This way, it does not look like the economy is experiencing a boom every spring as warm-weather jobs start to appear and entering a recession as they disappear in the fall. However, there is also the impact of weather that is better or worse than normal. Last winter was unusually mild across the US northeast and midwest. There were few serious snowstorms or bouts of frigid weather. This makes a big difference for the economy because factors that would typically slow the economy were not present. Ordinarily, construction sites would be closed for at least a few days in these regions because of the bad weather. Also, starts of many construction projects would be put off until the weather had warmed up. In addition, people will be more likely to go out shopping on a relatively warm winter day than in a snowstorm or subzero weather. This means that they would be more likely to go to a mall to buy small items like shoes and clothes. They would also be more likely to shop for bigger items like a car or house. And they would be more likely to go out to restaurants for meals when the weather is good. For these reasons, the data in the winter months was better than would otherwise have been the case. However, this virtually guaranteed that the data for the spring months would look worse than would otherwise be the case. If construction workers stayed employed through the winter, then they will not be hired on as new workers in the spring. This means that we will see less growth, or possibly declines, in construction employment because fewer workers than normal lost their job in the winter. The same would apply to retail employment and restaurant employment where more workers may have been kept on because of higher than normal business in the winter months. Insofar as the good weather led to better-than-normal car and house sales in the winter months, there will be a direct payback in lower than normal sales in the spring months. People who bought a house or car in January will not turn around and buy another one in April or May. This means that these months will be showing sales that are lower than the underlying trend. In general, we will be seeing economic data in April and May that make the economy look weaker than it actually is, just as the data from the winter months made it look stronger. The underlying picture of the economy has not changed much over the last six months. Ideally, economic analysts would be able to look past the gyrations in the data that are caused by the weather. Unfortunately, this rarely seems to be the case. Most economists jump on the latest numbers and seem to lose sight of context.

      "bodyText": "Retail sales dipped in April after a clampdown on supermarket food and grocery spending by hard-pressed families, according to a survey by the CBI. More retailers experienced a fall in sales than a rise in April compared with the same month last year, leaving a negative balance of -6, the CBI said. Furniture and carpet shops reported a modest rise in sales following a slump at the beginning of the year, but this was offset by grocers, who reported a decline in year-on-year sales for the first time since the euro crisis dominated the headlines last November. The poor figures will emphasise the warnings from some economists that persistently high inflation and low wage rises are depressing consumer spending and preventing the economy from expanding. Data from the Office for National Statistics showing the economy contracted in the first three months of the year, plunging the UK into recession, are expected to heighten consumer concerns and deter spending, especially on big-ticket items. Judith McKenna, chair of the CBI distributive trades panel and Asda's chief operating officer, said the situation on Britain's high streets remained fragile. She said: \"Consumers are still holding off from buying bigger ticket items, and opting to spend on smaller 'treat' purchases that give them a lift without breaking the budget. \"If as expected, inflation falls further later this year, we may see some growth in retail sales, but as long as high unemployment and sluggish wage growth dampen confidence, spending will remain tight.\" The outlook for the summer was moderately rosier after retailers said they expected to benefit from the Queen's diamond jubilee and the Olympics.

The man himself \u2013 note \u2013 will have known the result of the proxy votes before informing the board on Wednesday of his wish to retire. What we know already is that non-executives wasted no time in accepting Brennan's resignation; he'll be gone on 1 June. Discontent in the ranks is understandable. Brennan and the new stand-in chief, finance director Simon Lowth, repeatedly said on Thursday that AstraZeneca has a \"clear strategy\" \u2013 don't do big deals, collaborate and be agnostic about whether new drugs are sourced internally or externally. Yes, that's clear enough. But is the strategy fit for the next five years? It's hard to say so. The company faces a brutal few years as more important drugs lose their patents (first-quarter sales were down 11% to $7.35bn (\u00a34.53bn) we learned on Thursday, sending pre-tax profits down 38% to $2.05bn). The pipeline of new products looks uninspiring.

AstraZeneca is not alone in the pharma business in facing patent expiries, the consequences of a squeeze from government healthcare spending and smaller pipelines of new products. The difference in its case is perhaps that it stands in the middle of the road and feels the full force of the pressures. Unlike GlaxoSmithKline, it lacks the comfort blanket of a stable consumer healthcare division. Unlike Pfizer, it lacks the size (or perhaps daring) to make massive cuts in research and development spending. Things might have been different if the gamble on biotechnology group MedImmune \u2013 bought for $15.6bn in 2007 \u2013 had succeeded in bringing a flood of new products to market. Years of share buybacks funded by cost-cutting (Brennan has certainly run a tight ship) have allowed shareholders to hope that the going would get easier and that the labs, and a few collaboration and add-on deals, would eventually produce growth to match the cash flows from established products. But the sense that AstraZeneca needs a fundamental change of direction has now become overwhelming. Should it seek salvation in a big acquisition? Put itself up for sale?

A more \"cautious risk stance\" is being adopted by the Spanish-based bank in the UK mortgage market and it warned that it expected its overall stock of mortgages to contract slightly during the year. With a much anticipated stock market flotation already delayed until the end of 2013, the UK arm also warned of \"limited growth in our main market\". Santander, the largest bank in the eurozone with a market value of \u20ac52bn (\u00a345bn), expanded rapidly in the UK, buying Abbey National and, in the run-up to the banking crisis, Alliance &amp; Leicester and parts of Bradford &amp; Bingley. The bank felt the pain of its previous acquisitions as bad debt provisions rose 40% largely as a result of loans granted by A&amp;L before it was taken over by Santander in 2008. Ana Bot\u00edn, chief executive of Santander UK, said: \"The macroeconomic outlook, together with increased funding costs and low interest rates, will continue to put pressure on earnings this year, partially offset by a broadening and deepening of our customer relationships and the maintenance of our cost discipline. Regulatory uncertainties continue to impact our ability to plan ahead\". The UK, which made \u20ac306m of profits, contributes 13% of the total profits of the group, which has been battered by the crisis in the eurozone. Across the entire Santander group, provisions rose 51% to \u20ac3.1bn, which drove net profits down 24% to \u20ac1.6bn. The increase in provisions was largely related to the economic situation in Spain and Portugal, two of its main business areas. In continental Europe profits were down 34% although the bank stressed its diversification into other markets such as Brazil, which provided 27% of profits, and Mexico, which is to be partially floated off and which generated 13% of profits. Bot\u00edn, who runs the UK arm, is part of the founding family and was parachuted into the UK when Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio left to join Lloyds Banking Group.",

      "bodyText": "Barclays is taking an extra \u00a3300m hit for payment protection insurance as it prepares to face shareholders in a showdown over its pay policies at Friday's annual meeting. The bank reported its first-quarter results the day before its annual meeting at which one in four shareholders are expected to register a protest against the bank's pay policies, particularly the \u00a317m handed to the chief executive, Bob Diamond, and the \u00a35.7m the bank paid to cover his tax when he relocated from the US to become chief executive. Diamond refused to indicate the scale of the protest against the remuneration report or comment on the impact that the focus on the pay deals is having on the business after the Institute of Directors described Barclays' pay as \"out of order\". The increase in the PPI provision, which came after the bank had warned in March that it might have to raise the \u00a31bn provision, may indicate that other banks such as Royal Bank of Scotland and HSBC might also be facing higher bills to pay compensation for the insurance. The additional PPI provision pushed the bank to a \u00a3475m statutory loss before tax once a reversal in the value of paying back its own debt is included. Stripping out that additional \u00a32.6bn cost of paying back its own debt and the PPI charge, profits were up 22% at \u00a32.4m and were higher than had been expected. Shares rose 1.7% by 8.45am to trade at 211p. Ian Gordon, banks analyst at Investec, pointed to a strong performance from the Barclays Capital investment banking arm, where revenues were up 91% on the previous quarter. Diamond said the environment in which the bank operated was \"unpredictable\" but reckoned it was able to adapt.
