      "bodyText": "It is worth remembering that Peter Dutton was almost prime minister of Australia. Yes, the man who joked about sea levels rising and \u201cCape York time\u201d while standing underneath a live boom microphone was within a whisker of being the 30th prime minister. It is worth remembering such things because in our current political climate we too often live in the permanent present \u2013 barely looking ahead, and quickly forgetting the past. The permanent present has long been an issue in politics and yet, as often happens, the problem has grown under a new leadership. Does Scott Morrison\u2019s government look to the future? It can barely be bothered to look beyond the next half-hour. Remember this prime minister\u2019s first real act in the job was to respond to the issue of needles in strawberries by introducing a new offence and increasing the punishment in existing laws from 10 to 15 years in jail. This was despite the main problem not being people actually putting needles in strawberries but those hoaxing. The sensible approach would have been to tell people to keep buying strawberries (and do a photo-op eating them) and then to stop talking about it, as that was what was fuelling the copycats and the hoaxers. Instead, all due to a short-term need to look in-charge, we have new laws on the books for ever that we didn\u2019t need and that won\u2019t even affect those who actually did put needles in the strawberries in the first place! This week the prime minister\u2019s inability to look beyond the immediate was on display again. In an interview with Alan Jones, in response to a typical Jones bluster about Malcolm Turnbull, Morrison claimed that Turnbull was not in Indonesia this week to talk about trade or the Israel embassy: \u201cthe issues of trade and other things of course were not really part of the brief\u201d. And sure, that got a nice response from Jones, but was Morrison so focussed on the present that he thought that would be the end of it? It didn\u2019t take long before Turnbull took to Twitter to explain \u201ca few facts\u201d, namely that Morrison had actually asked him to \u201cdiscuss trade and the embassy issue\u201d. And that\u2019s the problem with short-termism. It might get you through that hour but little further, and it often reveals you either lack understanding of what you are doing or are flat-out wrong. Take Dan Tehan, the minister for education, who in response to a story that the previous education minster Simon Birmingham had rejected 11 ARC grant applications, announced that future ARC grants would need to pass a \u201cnational interest test\u201d. It was great short-termism \u2013 deal with a story by going on the front foot and doubling down (heck, that culture war ain\u2019t going to fight itself). And like all good short-termism it revealed the incompetence underlying the policy, as researchers around the nation quickly pointed out there is already a \u201cnational benefit\u201d requirement for ARC grants. So Tehan\u2019s solution to a non-problem was to announce the introduction of something that already exists. Top-notch governing. Then there was our nearly-PM, Peter Dutton, who revealed just how at-sea the government is over dealing with asylum seekers on Nauru, in the midst of a short-term worry about numbers in the parliament. The election of Kerryn Phelps has meant the government is going to be under severe pressure to hold sway in the House of Representatives and will likely to be forced to do a deal on children in detention. And so, to head off that issue, the government announced via the media it would bring the kids to Australia by the end of the year. Now this in itself is to be welcomed, but as Katharine Murphy has noted, there are more than a few issues still to be resolved, especially as the government continues to fight the ability of courts to order sick children be brought to Australia for care. But the short-termism behind the decision and the overall policy was also revealed when Dutton gave two interviews. Firstly, on 2GB with Ray Hadley he argued that transferring asylum seekers to New Zealand would be \u201ca green light to people smugglers\u201d, which makes one wonder, if that is so, why Scott Morrison was raising it as an issue just two weeks ago. Worse, however, was within the next minute he boasted that 439 of a possible 1,250 asylum seekers had already been transferred to the US. So going to New Zealand is an incentive but the US is not? I know Donald Trump is awful but that does seem a bit of a stretch. Then Dutton went on Sky News, where he not only kept up the logic that a deal with the US was fine but one with New Zealand was not, he suggested as well that the children would be brought to Australia but that they and their families would not be able to settle here. So they\u2019re here, but not for good, but they will also all be off Nauru by the end of the year, but they\u2019re not here for good, so then they will go ... err, where exactly? Dutton wants them to go back home but that has not occurred yet so why would it now? They can\u2019t go to New Zealand, so where then? Back to Nauru? But they will all be off Nauru by the end of the year ... Short-term answers are, as always, good for providing more questions. And then Dutton revealed his complete short-termism by trying to get through the interview by arguing he was not bringing the children to Australia because of medical reasons but because of the cost. But the cost has always been a major issue. It has always been more expensive to detain asylum seekers offshore \u2013 just over $1bn a year, according to the Parliamentary Library. Dutton, laughably, seemed not to realise his reasoning undermined the entirety of the policy. Either it is cost-effective or it is not. If it isn\u2019t now, why was it before? Or is Dutton admitting the government has been wasting money, all in the name of trying to wedge the opposition and please talkback hosts? Under this current government the past and its poor decisions are forgotten, but unfortunately they live on \u2013 whether it be in law changes, research funding guidelines, climate change inaction, or the lives of asylum seekers. Short-term solutions rarely actually help the government with its problems but they almost always do lasting damage.",

      "bodyText": "A sparkly bonfire night cake and a traditional English sausage and mash were both on offer in October\u2019s edition of Sainsbury\u2019s Magazine. More prominent than this seasonal fare, though, was a bold attempt to broaden readers\u2019 horizons: a front-page photo of a \u201cgolden Persian curry\u201d, tagged as \u201cthe dinner party dish you HAVE to try\u201d. But the magazine\u2019s fusion adventure has now backfired. Its editors stand accused of \u201clazy, casual racism\u201d because, according to Iranian readers, chefs and fans of Persian cookery, the ingredients bear little or no relation to the region\u2019s authentic cuisine. The culinary controversy soon spilled on to the pages of the journal\u2019s Twitter feed and Instagram account, where accusations of sloppy \u201ccultural appropriation\u201d abounded, although they have since been taken down by the magazine. Reader Pooneh Arrondelle wrote: \u201cThis is NOT a Persian recipe, it can\u2019t even be said to be inspired by Persian cuisine. No Persian/Iranian would ever mix these ingredients. You think sprinkling a few pomegranate seeds on to something makes it Persian?\u201d British Iranian Banafsheh Hay was stirred to write directly to Sainsbury\u2019s chief executive, Mike Coupe, asking for an apology, and she remains angered by the lack of care taken. \u201cTo treat Iranian and Indian cuisines as virtually indistinguishable, despite knowing in reality they are very different, in order to save their readers the effort to learn about a new Iranian cuisine which the magazine wants to promote on its front cover smacks of lazy, casual racism and is abhorrent,\u201d she told the Observer. The words \u201cHalloween horror\u201d, also on the front page, had taken on an awful new meaning by the time the editor, Helena Lang, was forced to respond. Sainsbury\u2019s \u201cPersian curry\u201d was merely \u201cinspired\u201d by Persian cuisine, she explained to Arrondelle in an email. It was based on \u201ctwo traditional stews \u2013 khoresh and fesenjan\u201d, Lang added. But the explanation only served to escalate the row. Arrondelle returned to Instagram to point out \u201ckhoresh\u201d is not a traditional Persian dish, but merely the Farsi word for \u201cstew\u201d. To underline her point, the reader posted a suggestion: \u201cFor your next edition, I\u2019d suggest you celebrate British food \u2013 350g of beef, cubed, cooked with roast parsnip, boiled cabbage, dash of baked beans, mix it [sic] a bit of Marmite and an Oxo cube, sprinkle with bacon bits, rosemary, sage, roast onions. Serve with a crumpet and call it a British Sunday roast.\u201d The row comes in the wake of the resignation of Waitrose Magazine\u2019s editor William Sitwell, who upset his publishers last week when news reached them of his \u201cill-judged joke\u201d about \u201ckilling\u201d the growing ranks of vegan eaters, \u201cone by one\u201d. Sainsbury\u2019s Magazine, published by Seven, has issued an apology for any offence caused: \u201cWe love developing exciting recipes for Sainsbury\u2019s customers and our inspiration comes from different cuisines around the world,\u201d it reads. \u201cWe wanted to introduce Persian flavours to readers who may not have enjoyed them before, and so we created a recipe which is inspired by the traditional Persian dish Fesenjan, fused with an Indian-style curry.\u201d And not everyone was disappointed by the recipe. Several readers have posted their approval, including Hayley Davies, who described the lamb curry she made as \u201cdelicious\u201d. Nevertheless, Farshid Ziafat, owner of Hafez, one of London\u2019s oldest Iranian restaurants, is clear no dish resembling Sainsbury\u2019s stew exists in Iran. \u201cPersian cuisine does not use any combination of dried spices remotely like curry powder in any recipe,\u201d he said, denying that Fesenjan, his restaurant\u2019s signature dish, could have provided inspiration, as it must contain pomegranate molasses and walnuts. It is a key traditional dish, brought out at weddings and celebrations as far back as the Persian empire. \u201cIt is not the first time that Sainsbury\u2019s food writers have created a \u2018Persian\u2019-themed recipe and poorly researched the apparent \u2018inspiration\u2019; anyone with knowledge of our cuisine will spot the glaring error in this confused mash-up,\u201d Ziafat said. Ali Bidarbakht, owner of popular Iranian restaurant Galleria in London\u2019s Marylebone, agrees that Sainsbury\u2019s \u201cPersian Curry\u201d front cover was badly conceived. \u201cSainsbury\u2019s has taken an Indian or an Asian dish, and tried to link it to Persian cuisine, which is a big mistake,\u201d he said. The rapid rise of the world food trend has led to other recent allegations of cultural appropriation or misrepresentation. When Jamie Oliver was accused of exploiting Jamaican heritage with his jerk rice dish, he argued he had been influenced by the cuisine, and was not copying it. Tamsin Burnett-Hall, Sainsbury\u2019s Magazine\u2019s food editor, took the same line on the disputed curry in a comment posted on her public Instagram. \u201cAs most recipe writers do, I often take inspiration from cuisines around the world and mix them with other ideas, to create new and exciting recipes,\u201d she wrote. \u201cAlthough we know \u2018curry\u2019 isn\u2019t authentically Persian, we did feel the word went some way towards explaining what this delicious spiced dish might taste like, to British readers very used to eating Indian-style curries.\u201d Hay said Burnett-Hall\u2019s use of the phrase \u201cBritish readers\u201d was particularly annoying. \u201cHow do they define their \u2018British readers\u2019?\u201d she asked. \u201cDo they have a chart for all those readers who will be able to cope with a curry-free new cuisine and those that won\u2019t? Sainsbury\u2019s needs to get a grip and give its magazine\u2019s readers more credit.\u201d Sainsbury\u2019s Magazine has replied: \u201cWe regret if the reference we made to \u2018British readers\u2019 has been misunderstood. This recipe was designed to encourage our readers to embrace a range of flavours from around the world and try new combinations they may not have tried before.\u201d For Ziafat, the recipe\u2019s worst crime was its treatment of saffron. \u201cInstead of adding it at the end of cooking, you put it in at the start, thereby destroying its subtle aromatic flavour by stewing it for 90 minutes! This is the real sacrilege,\u201d he said.",

You think sprinkling a few pomegranate seeds on to something makes it Persian?\u201d</p> <p>British Iranian Banafsheh Hay was stirred to write directly to Sainsbury\u2019s chief executive,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jun/08/sainsburys-chief-mike-coupe-money-pay-package\" title=\"\"> Mike Coupe</a>, asking for an apology, and she remains angered by the lack of care taken. \u201cTo treat Iranian and Indian cuisines as virtually indistinguishable, despite knowing in reality they are very different, in order to save their readers the effort to learn about a new Iranian cuisine which the magazine wants to promote on its front cover smacks of lazy, casual racism and is abhorrent,\u201d she told the <em>Observer</em>.</p> <p>The words \u201cHalloween horror\u201d, also on the front page, had taken on an awful new meaning by the time the editor, Helena Lang, was forced to respond. Sainsbury\u2019s \u201cPersian curry\u201d was merely \u201cinspired\u201d by Persian cuisine, she explained to Arrondelle in an email. It was based on \u201ctwo traditional stews \u2013 khoresh and fesenjan\u201d, Lang added. But the explanation only served to escalate the row.</p> <p>Arrondelle returned to Instagram to point out \u201ckhoresh\u201d is not a traditional Persian dish, but merely the Farsi word for \u201cstew\u201d.</p> <p>To underline her point, the reader posted a suggestion: \u201cFor your next edition, I\u2019d suggest you celebrate British food \u2013 350g of beef, cubed, cooked with roast parsnip, boiled cabbage, dash of baked beans, mix it [sic] a bit of Marmite and an Oxo cube, sprinkle with bacon bits, rosemary, sage, roast onions. Serve with a crumpet and call it a British Sunday roast.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"69f3d81c42f5d596d99b453ae89067c335c3f958\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/69f3d81c42f5d596d99b453ae89067c335c3f958/3_0_953_1191/800.jpg\" alt=\"The magazine that caused offence.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The magazine that caused offence.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The row comes in the wake of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/oct/31/waitrose-magazine-editor-william-sitwell-steps-down-over-email-mocking-vegans\" title=\"\">resignation of Waitrose Magazine\u2019s editor William Sitwell</a>, who upset his publishers last week when news reached them of his \u201cill-judged joke\u201d about \u201ckilling\u201d the growing ranks of vegan eaters, \u201cone by one\u201d.</p> <p><em>Sainsbury\u2019s Magazine</em>, published by Seven, has issued an apology for any offence caused: \u201cWe love developing exciting recipes for Sainsbury\u2019s customers and our inspiration comes from different cuisines around the world,\u201d it reads. \u201cWe wanted to introduce Persian flavours to readers who may not have enjoyed them before, and so we created a recipe which is inspired by the traditional Persian dish Fesenjan, fused with an Indian-style curry.\u201d</p> <p>And not everyone was disappointed by the recipe. Several readers have posted their approval, including Hayley Davies, who described the lamb curry she made as \u201cdelicious\u201d.</p> <p>Nevertheless, Farshid Ziafat, owner of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/iran-blog/2016/feb/03/top-five-persian-restaurants-london\" title=\"\">Hafez</a>, one of London\u2019s oldest Iranian restaurants, is clear no dish resembling Sainsbury\u2019s stew exists in Iran. \u201cPersian cuisine does not use any combination of dried spices remotely like curry powder in any recipe,\u201d he said, denying that Fesenjan, his restaurant\u2019s signature dish, could have provided inspiration, as it must contain pomegranate molasses and walnuts. It is a key traditional dish, brought out at weddings and celebrations as far back as the Persian empire.</p> <p>\u201cIt is not the first time that Sainsbury\u2019s food writers have created a \u2018Persian\u2019-themed recipe and poorly researched the apparent \u2018inspiration\u2019; anyone with knowledge of our cuisine will spot the glaring error in this confused mash-up,\u201d Ziafat said.</p> <p>Ali Bidarbakht, owner of popular Iranian restaurant Galleria in London\u2019s Marylebone, agrees that Sainsbury\u2019s \u201cPersian Curry\u201d front cover was badly conceived.</p> <p>\u201cSainsbury\u2019s has taken an Indian or an Asian dish, and tried to link it to Persian cuisine, which is a big mistake,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The rapid rise of the world food trend has led to other recent allegations of cultural appropriation or misrepresentation. When Jamie Oliver was accused of exploiting Jamaican heritage with his jerk rice dish, he argued he had been influenced by the cuisine, and was not copying it.</p> <p>Tamsin Burnett-Hall, <em>Sainsbury\u2019s Magazine</em>\u2019s food editor, took the same line on the disputed curry in a comment posted on her public Instagram.</p> <p>\u201cAs most recipe writers do, I often take inspiration from cuisines around the world and mix them with other ideas, to create new and exciting recipes,\u201d she wrote. \u201cAlthough we know \u2018curry\u2019 isn\u2019t authentically Persian, we did feel the word went some way towards explaining what this delicious spiced dish might taste like, to British readers very used to eating Indian-style curries.\u201d</p> <p>Hay said Burnett-Hall\u2019s use of the phrase \u201cBritish readers\u201d was particularly annoying. \u201cHow do they define their \u2018British readers\u2019?\u201d she asked. \u201cDo they have a chart for all those readers who will be able to cope with a curry-free new cuisine and those that won\u2019t? Sainsbury\u2019s needs to get a grip and give its magazine\u2019s readers more credit.\u201d</p> <p><em>Sainsbury\u2019s Magazine</em> has replied: \u201cWe regret if the reference we made to \u2018British readers\u2019 has been misunderstood. This recipe was designed to encourage our readers to embrace a range of flavours from around the world and try new combinations they may not have tried before.\u201d</p> <p>For Ziafat, the recipe\u2019s worst crime was its treatment of saffron. \u201cInstead of adding it at the end of cooking, you put it in at the start, thereby destroying its subtle aromatic flavour by stewing it for 90 minutes! This is the real sacrilege,\u201d he said.</p>",
