      "bodyText": "Smith &amp; Wesson shares have soared to their highest level in more than a decade as Barack Obama tearfully announced new restrictions on gun sales designed to reduce the nation\u2019s epidemic of mass shootings. Shares in Smith &amp; Wesson rose by more than 11% on Tuesday to end the day at a new high of $25.86 after the world\u2019s biggest gun company told investors that it expected bumper sales, as consumers have rushed out to buy more guns while politicians debate gun control legislation. It said sales had been so strong in the wake of the San Bernardino massacre, which left 14 people dead last month, that some distributors were beginning to run out of some of its most popular guns. The company, which makes a third of all revolvers owned in the US, said sales in the three months to the end of January are expected to come in at between $175-180m, considerably higher than its previous estimate of $150-155m. It said it expected annual revenues to total $650-660m, up from $627m it made last year. In a brief statement late on Monday night, the company said: \u201cThe sell-through rate of its products at distribution has been stronger than originally anticipated, resulting in reduced distributor inventories of its firearms.\u201d The company added that Adjusted National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) data for the month of December, which serves as an indicator of consumer purchases, \u201creflected strong growth versus December 2014\u201d. The NICS data shows a jump of 37.6% in December. Black Friday was the biggest single day in NICS history. Smith &amp; Wesson\u2019s statement was welcomed by investors and analysts, with its shares jumping almost 6% on Monday and a further 12.5% to $26.30 by 2pm ET on Tuesday. The shares had earlier spiked as high as $26.54, the highest intraday value since February 1999. Shares in the nation\u2019s other big listed gun company, Sturm, Ruger &amp; Company, rose by 7.4% to $66. Brian Ruttenbur, an analyst at BB&amp;T Capital Markets, upgraded Smith &amp; Wesson from hold to buy, and raised his price target on Ruger shares from $63 to $70. \u201cMany demand drivers (presidential elections, potential regulations, and new product introductions) should allow for very strong top- and bottom-line growth for [Ruger],\u201d he said in a research note. Just days after the San Bernardino shooting last month, Smith &amp; Wesson CEO James Debney told investors: \u201cObviously there have been some tragic recent events, but we\u2019re in the holiday season with people shopping for firearms.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Sainsbury\u2019s has made a \u00a31bn move to buy Home Retail Group, the owner of Argos and Homebase, as it seeks to strengthen its business against the rise of the discounters and Amazon. The supermarket group said it had made an approach to Home Retail in November, but its proposal was rejected last month. Sainsbury\u2019s, which has Argos outlets in a handful of its stores, said it was now considering its position. Under takeover rules, the retailer has until 5pm on 2 February to either announce a firm intention to bid or to withdraw. Shares in Home Retail Group soared 41% to 139.3p after the supermarket put out a statement on Tuesday, valuing the group at \u00a31.1bn. However, shares in Sainsbury\u2019s fell by almost 5%, to 242p, as investors feared the supermarket would be distracted in the midst of tough grocery market conditions. Sainsbury\u2019s, which was forced to put out a statement by the Takeover Panel, a City regulator, after a spike in Home Retail Group\u2019s share price, said its board believed a combination of the two groups would be \u201can attractive proposition for the customers and shareholders of both companies, establishing a platform for long-term value creation\u201d. It added that the two businesses had complementary product offers which they would be able to deliver to shoppers at home or for pick-up in stores. It is understood that Sainsbury\u2019s is interested in Argos\u2019s delivery network and IT systems which it believes will help it take on Amazon, the US online retailer which is increasing its presence in the UK grocery market. Home Retail, which is scheduled to release trading figures next Thursday, said it had rejected Sainsbury\u2019s approach because it \u201cundervalued Home Retail Group and its long-term prospects\u201d. Sainsbury\u2019s bid comes at a time when all the UK\u2019s major supermarket chains are under pressure as people increasingly buy their weekly shop online or pick up groceries from small neighbourhood stores. The rapid growth of discounters Aldi and Lidl has generated a price war, slashing supermarket profits. Tony Shiret, an analyst at Haitong Research, said Home Retail shareholders would \u201cbe biting their arm off\u201d if the supermarket made a firm offer of 130p a share or more. But he said the cash and stock bid lacked business logic and this should deter J Sainsbury shareholders. \u201cIt seems like a desperate move from Sainsbury\u2019s. Were they sipping the Christmas sherry early? This would be a distraction for them. They would be buying a retailer in very difficult markets requiring a huge amount of management time,\u201d Shiret said. \u201cThe grocery market is tough enough. Why throw themselves in the way of Amazon?\u201d Veteran retail analyst Richard Hyman agreed: \u201cIn my view, this deal and trying to make it work, has more potential to hinder than to help.\u201d Analysts at investment bank Investec said Home Retail could be worth as much as \u00a31.45bn, or 180p a share, and an attempted bid was no surprise given its low stock market value. However, Scott Ransley, analyst at stockbroker Stifel, said: \u201cWe are surprised Home Retail\u2019s board rejected the approach, particularly given the credibility of the buyer.\u201d Sainsbury\u2019s said a tie-up would \u201ccreate a food and non-food retailer of choice\u201d, with a strong presence in food, grocery, clothing, homewares, toys, stationery, electricals, furniture and other general merchandise. The two businesses would be able to save costs by combining stores and operations, according to Sainsbury\u2019s. The supermarket group said it could sell its products via Argos\u2019s network as well as install more Argos outlets in its supermarkets. Sainsbury\u2019s owned Homebase until 2000, when it sold most of its stake in the DIY chain to the private equity group Permira, in a \u00a3750m deal. The chain was then sold on to GUS, a former incarnation of Home Retail Group, in 2002. Argos operates about 10 outlets in Sainsbury\u2019s stores, after the two companies agreed to work together a year ago. The supermarket group brought in Argos to take up under-utilised space alongside other retail partners including Timpson shoe repair and Jessops, the camera shop. Rumours of a bid for Home Retail have been circulating since November after the company issued a profit warning ahead of the Black Friday discount day. Shares dived 16%, wiping \u00a3200m off the value retailer in October as Home Retail said it could not be sure whether the millions it had invested in a new same-day delivery service for Argos, including new vans and a high-profile advertising campaign, would bear fruit. Since then, Argos has faced heavy criticism from shoppers as its distribution network and website struggled to cope with demand in the run up to Christmas. A number of private equity firms were thought to be considering an offer for the Argos and Homebase owner. French DIY chain Leroy Merlin and a former boss of the Garden Centre Group, Nicholas Marshall, were both said to be eyeing a bid for Homebase alone. Sainsbury\u2019s did not refer to gaining a position in the DIY and garden centre market in its statement on the rationale for the bid, with analysts suggesting the supermarket might consider a side deal to offload it. Analysts said Sainsbury\u2019s might close dozens of Argos outlets, or consider turning them into convenience stores or part of its Netto discounter chain if the deal went ahead.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "It was not as turbulent a day as Monday\u2019s rout, but stock markets still suffered another volatile session. Weak Chinese data and a halt in share trading sent investors running for cover on the first trading day of the year, and while a subsequent attempt by the Chinese central bank to stablise shares did manage to calm things for a while, the mood was still skittish. Commodity companies - hit hard on Monday by concerns about slowing growth in China - recovered some ground and gave support to markets, the FTSE 100 in particular. But an uncertain opening on Wall Street took off some of the shine. Oil prices were weak again, as fears of falling demand outweighed supply concerns in the wake of growing Middle East tensions. Brent crude is currently 2% lower at $36.47 a barrel. More Chinese news due overnight could set the tone for Wednesday\u2019s markets. Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct said: There is more PMI data [for the service sector] out of China overnight that could again unsettle sentiment, whilst the US ADP payroll number tomorrow will start to offer some clues ahead of Friday\u2019s non farm payrolls. Although the US has made that first step up the interest rate ladder, the question now is the pace of change and again anything that looks too hasty could see the bears back in play. Overall the final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 43.81 points or 0.72% at 6137.24, having risen as high as 6166 and fallen as low as 6079. Germany\u2019s Dax edged up 0.26% to 10,310.10 France\u2019s Cac closed up 0.34% to 4537.63 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB added 1.2% to 20,983.24 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 0.24% at 9335.2 But in Greece, the Athens market lost 0.57% to 617.59 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 89 points or 0.5%. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow for the latest services PMI data and other financial developments. Sterling fell to a nine month low against the dollar, down half a percent as the US currency continued to gain ground. But the pound edged up a similar amount against the euro following eurozone inflation figures which suggested no rush for the European Central Bank to sanction further stimulus measures. Strong UK construction figures vied with the uncertainty of a possible Brexit from Europe to influence the direction of the pound during the day. Here\u2019s something from Bloomberg showing that - despite this week\u2019s falls - the Chinese market is still expensive: Given the backdrop of disappointing Chinese data and growing tensions in the Middle East, this week\u2019s US main economic events - the minutes of the Federal Reserve\u2019s rate-rising meeting and Friday\u2019s non-farm payroll figures - will be closely watched. Christopher Vecchio, currency analyst at DailyFX, said: Weak economic data from across the globe - particularly China and the Euro-Zone - has the US dollar on stronger footing ahead of key event risk this week. Despite some alarming signs coming from the US economy (soft consumption figures, mixed housing data, and recession-level industrial production), investors and traders alike remain focused on \u2018the big picture\u2019: how fast will the Federal Reserve tighten policy this year? With the December Federal Open Market Committee minutes due on Wednesday and the December US non-farm payrolls report due on Friday, market participants - short- or long-term in nature alike - will have a fresh look at where the Fed stands... Parsing the FOMC minutes and reviewing the details of the December labor reports should help provide enough clarity for judgement to be made on \u201cwho is wrong\u201d: either the market, currently pricing in two rates hikes for this year (via Fed funds futures); or the Fed, currently suggesting it will hike rates four times this year. In the event that the FOMC meeting and the US non-farm payrolls prove to be supportive of the US dollar, it will likely come at the detriment of higher yielding currencies and risk-correlated assets. Any signs that the Fed could tighten policy faster than currently expected, against a backdrop of rising tensions between Iran and Saudi Arabia as well as Chinese/emerging market growth concerns, would seem like a caustic mix of influences for the commodity currency bloc in particular. Wall Street has followed other global markets in attempting to stage a rebound after Monday\u2019s China-induced rout. But as in Europe, the rally is rather tentative. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 42 points or 0.2% in early trading, while the S&amp;P 500 has opened 0.16% better and Nasdaq is 0.3% higher. In Europe, the FTSE 100 is currently up 0.79% while Germany\u2019s Dax has added 0.33% and France\u2019s Cac has climbed 0.48%. Oil prices remain under pressure, on fears of falling demand in the wake of the poor Chinese data seen over the past few days. A stronger US dollar is not helping matters, since it makes holding dollar-denominated commodities more expensive. These factors are outweighing the growing tensions in the Middle East - especially between Saudi Arabia and Iran - which could hinder supply. So Brent crude is currently down 1.2% at $36.77 a barrel, while WTI is nearly 1% lower at $36.40. Accountancy group ICAEW reckons that British businesses are actually more worried about the domestic situation, rather than problems in China. A survey of its members found that the the UK economy is the number one concern for 2016. However, they\u2019re less concerned about the eurozone economy, geopolitics, or the looming referendum on Britain\u2019s membership of the European Union. Here\u2019s the details: 41% of businesses feel that the growing uncertainty around the UK\u2019s position in the EU could have a negative impact, compared with 50% a year ago Businesses are less concerned about the negative impact of low economic growth in the Eurozone than they were two years ago (44% v 56% in 2014). Although exporters are displaying the same concern than they did last year, with 60% expecting a negative impact. Low UK inflation is expected to have a positive impact on over a third of companies (36%) but over half (52%) would be negatively impacted by any interest rate rise in 2016 Instability in the Middle East and Ukraine is much less of a concern to business with 29% of respondents expecting a negative impact (down from 41%). Time for a quick recap. European stock markets remain fragile today, after an early attempt to rally back from Monday\u2019s slump floundered. The main bourses are mixed as traders snatch lunch in the City. The German and French markets are down around 0.5%, while Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 is managing a slight recovery, up 18 point, having been 70 points higher in early trading. Investors are bruised following yesterday\u2019s slump, which was the worst start to a trading year since the dot-com crash. China remains a big worry today. Overnight, Chinese authorities intervened to prevent another slump on the Shanghai market. State-backed authorities bought up shares, in a bid to prop up values. This helped the Chinese market to end the day roughly where it started. However, the intervention may also shows that Beijing is worried about future problems, given its slowing economy and the build-up of bad debts since the financial crisis began. Chris Beauchamp of IG sums up the morning: Early optimism on the London market has faded as investors continue to fret about the situation in Chinese markets. As in August, state-directed buying of stocks is competing with individual selling of equities, but China\u2019s latest attempt to \u2018buck the market\u2019 is likely to end as well as its efforts last year. The butterfly effect has been felt in Europe again this morning, with an initial bounce giving way to more selling, while in London the FTSE is fighting hard to hold on to small gains. While Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets warns: ...the prospect of another Summer-style Chinese rout (the one which made the Fed hold off from hiking) remains a real possibility. There is disappointment that eurozone inflation remains at just 0.2%, despite the ECB\u2019s stimulus measures. And there\u2019s also drama in the City. with Sainsbury\u2019s threatening to pounce on Home Retail, the firm behind Argos and Homebase.... ....while the unusually warm weather has hurt sales at high street chain Next: If Sainsbury takes over Home Retail, it will reunite the company with the homes-and-gardens chain Homebase after a 15-year break. Big news in the City..... supermarket chain Sainsbury\u2019s has revealed that it made a takeover approach to Home Retail (which owns Argos and Homebase). The offer was made, and rejected, in November, Sainsbury says. It is now considering its position, and has until February 2 to make a new bid. Rumours have been swirling for weeks that Home Retail could be a takeover target. Sainsbury\u2019s decision to out itself as a possible bidder has send Home Retail shares soaring, up 30%. More here: William Hobbs, head of investment strategy at Barclays Plc\u2019s wealth-management unit in London, sums up the situation well -- it\u2019s \u201creally messy\u201d in the markets right now. He told Bloomberg that investors around the globe are on edge today, and fearing trouble ahead. \u201cNot much is expected of the world in terms of growth, risk appetite is biased to the downside and weak data from China to the U.S. hasn\u2019t helped at all. Plenty of people out there believe that the next global recession is imminent.\u201d US stock markets are expected to post fresh losses today, when they open in three hours time. The Dow Jones industrial average is tipped to fall by around 100 points, adding to Monday\u2019s 276 point slide. The euro has lost ground against the US dollar since December\u2019s inflation figures came out. It\u2019s down over half a cent at $1.076. Although eurozone inflation is clearly weak, it may not be bad enough to force more stimulus out of the European Central Bank, argues Teunis Brosens of ING. While headline inflation was stuck at 0.2%, core inflation (stripping out energy and food) was also unchanged at 0.9% in December. Brosens says: Hawks may argue that weak core inflation is unsurprising given the still high unemployment in many Eurozone countries. Moreover, despite this month\u2019s weakening of core inflation, the presence of second-round effects is not yet convincing. We think that the ECB will hold its fire for now: it will take more convincing evidence of second round effects or other really disappointing economic news to stir the ECB into further action. And that\u2019s why shares have fallen back this morning: So much for the bounce-back. European stock markets couldn\u2019t even stay in the green until London\u2019s pubs opened for the day. The weak eurozone inflation reading has helped to pull the major indices into the red for the second day running. The German Dax has shed another 1%, on top of Monday\u2019s 4% slump. The Paris CAC is down another 0.8%, and London\u2019s FTSE 100 is off eight points. Ipek Ozkardeskaya of City firm London Capital Group says China is still worrying investors, even though Beijing\u2019s central bank, the People\u2019s Bank of China, stepped in overnight to prop up its stock market. She writes that market sentiment is \u201cvery much fragile\u201d: The apocalyptic Chinese story keeps the headlines busy. The intervention from the PBoC eased tensions at the heart of the storm, yet the chaotic start to 2016 warned of a challenging year ahead of us. The first trading day of the year has clearly wiped away some of the optimism and the risk-off flows dominate. Shanghai\u2019s Composite opened the day 3.1% lower yet managed to recover later in the session. State-controlled funds bought equities to halt the $590bn worth of sell-off suffered on Monday, and a selling ban for investors would extend beyond a week according to several sources. The European Central Bank will be concerned that inflation remained so low last month, says Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight: Good news for Eurozone consumers but a headache for the ECB as consumer price inflation remained down at 0.2% in December, thereby defying expectations of a small uptick. The failure of Eurozone inflation to pick up in December is good news for consumers\u2019 purchasing power; but it will maintain ECB concern that prolonged very low inflation could lead to a renewed weakening in inflation expectations thereby making it harder still to get Eurozone consumer price inflation up to its target rate of close to 2%. December\u2019s unexpectedly weak inflation report is hurting the euro. The single currency has hit its lowest level against the yen since April 2015. One euro is now worth \u00a5128.03, down from \u00a5129.33 earlier. Breaking: inflation across the eurozone remained uncomfortably weak last month. Prices across the single currency region rose by just 0.2% annually in December, Eurostat has just reported. That matches November\u2019s reading, and dashes hopes of a rise to 0.3% or 0.4%. Cheaper energy costs are partly to blame..... but food and service price inflation did also slow last month: Eurostat says: Food, alcohol &amp; tobacco is expected to have the highest annual rate in December (1.2%, compared with 1.5% in November), followed by services (1.1%, compared with 1.2% in November), non-energy industrial goods (0.5%, stable compared with November) and energy (-5.9%, compared with -7.3% in November). The European Central Bank is meant to maintain inflation close to, but below, 2% -- but we\u2019re a long way from that despite the ECB\u2019s quantitative easing stimulus measures.... Britain\u2019s builders didn\u2019t get much rest over Christmas, judging by the latest healthcheck from the sector. Data firm Markit reports that output jumped last month, pushing its PMI index up to 57.8 in December, up from a seven-month low of 55.3. That suggests the sector grew at a faster pace last month. Markit cited \u201cfavourable demand conditions\u201d, with builders reporting that clients were more willing to commit to new projects. Commercial construction had a particularly good month, with growth hitting its fastest rate since October 2014. The unusually warm weather in December may also be a factor, as Britain didn\u2019t suffer the kind of heavy snowfalls that can scupper construction work this time of year. Firms who can build flood defences could be busy in 2016 too, as communities across the country try to shore themselves up. This morning\u2019s rally is looking a little fragile, after less than 90 minutes. European stock markets have shed much of their early gains, and are now broadly flat. Invesotrs Here comes the latest measure of German unemployment..... and it\u2019s better than expected. The number of people out of work across Germany fell by 14,000 last month, on a seasonally-adjusted basis. That smashes expectations of a 6,000 drop, and shows Germany is still outperforming many neighbours. This leaves its unemployment rate unchanged at 6.3%, compared to a eurozone average of 10.7%. Spain has also reported that its jobless total shrank by 8% last year: Mining stocks are leading this morning\u2019s rally in London. Commodity giant Glencore is up over 4%, as fears over China ease a little (for the moment....) Tony Cross of Trustnext Direct says traders are taking their cue from Asia: London\u2019s FTSE-100 has recovered some of yesterday\u2019s losses at the open, thanks in no small part to the fact that Asian equity markets appear to have stabilised overnight \u2013 at least for now. The vast majority of blue chips are trading in positive territory although the handful of losing stocks are being dominated by clothing retailers with that trading update from Next this morning providing little reason to get excited about the sector. High street chain Debenhams\u2019 shares have fallen by 2% in early trading. That reflects concerns that Next\u2019s weak sales over Christmas could be mirrored across the sector. Marks &amp; Spencer are down 0.5%. Shares in Next are out of fashion this morning. They\u2019re down by 3% at the start of trading, leading the FTSE fallers, as the City digests this morning\u2019s disappointing Christmas trading. Here\u2019s some reaction: Shares are rallying across Europe at the start of trading, as investors recover their nerve after Monday\u2019s heavy selloff. In London, the FTSE 100 has jumped by 72 points, or 1.2%, to 6165 points. That claws back almost half of yesterday\u2019s rout, when the blue-chip index shed 148 points. The French CAC, German DAX, Spanish IBEX and Italian FTSE MIB are all up around 1.1%. Yesterday, the DAX slumped by over 4%, so today\u2019s rally is only a partial recovery. Traders are encouraged by the news that Chinese authorities took action overnight to prevent their stock market tumbling again. Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets, explains: In the aftermath of a global sell-off over China growth fears, UK and European stock index futures are taking their cues from the Chinese stock market on Tuesday. After an initial wobble, shares in Shanghai and Shenzhen turned positive on Tuesday thanks to an injection of liquidity from the People\u2019s Bank of China. High street retailer Next has sent a shiver through the sector this morning, after posting weaker than expected results for the crucial Christmas period. Full price sales rose by just +0.4% from 26 October to 24 December. That\u2019s a serious slowdown, as Next sales grew by 6% between July and September. And as Next is the first major European retailer to report Christmas trading figures, this may mean more trouble ahead... Next pinned much of the blame on the unusually warm weather this autumn. This is a classic excuse for British retailers, who can often point to the skies to explain away a poor performance. But to give Next credit, it also released a graph showing how sales did indeed shrink in weeks where the temperature was hotter than in 2014: And the weather isn\u2019t the only culprit. The firm also admits that its catalogue shopping arm, NEXT Directory\u2019s, suffered poor stock availability from October onward. Spread-betting firm IG is predicting that European markets will bounce back when trading begins in a few minutes, clawing back some of Monday\u2019s losses. IG is calling the main markets up around 1%: It\u2019s been a wild day in China, as Beijing tries to prevent a repeat of Monday\u2019s rout. Chinese authorities intervened in the markets today, buying up stocks to give investors confidence. And it appears to have worked. The Shanghai composite index has closed for the day, down just 0.28%, having shed 3% at one stage today. That\u2019s rather better than Monday\u2019s 7% slump, which forced trading to be halted. That doesn\u2019t address the underlying problems in China, such as the build-up of bad debts and its slowing economy. And it suggests Beijing isn\u2019t prepared to allow market forces to take their natural course.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u2019s day two of the trading year, and investors around the globe will be hoping for a better performance than on day one. There\u2019s a nervous air in the markets today, after yesterday\u2019s selloff wiped hundreds of billions of dollars off bourses worldwide. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 lost \u00a338bn in a blink of an eye: But unlike vanishing candyfloss, market value can reappear. And European stock markets are expected to recover some ground today. But it could be another volatile session, with concerns over China\u2019s economy looming over markets. Also on the agenda today, we get the first estimate of eurozone inflation for December. Economists predict it will rise to an annual rate of 0.4%, from 0.2% in November. We also get the latest German unemployment data for December, and an estimate of how UK builders fared last month. 8.55am GMT: German unemployment report 9.30am GMT: UK construction PMI 10am: Eurozone inflation for December And high street retailer Next is reporting its financial results for the last quarter.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The European commission has launched an investigation into the UK\u2019s plans to support the conversion of part of its Drax coal power plant to biomass. The commission, which late last year gave approval for the German energy group RWE to undertake a similar conversion at its Lynemouth plant, wants to ensure the Drax plans are in line with EU state aid rules. The carbon footprint is reduced by 86% by burning wood pellets rather than coal, according to figures audited by PwC. The commission said it \u201cfully supports member state efforts to increase the use of renewable energy and pursue EU energy and climate objectives. At the same time, EU state aid rules make sure that the cost of such support for consumers is limited and does not give certain operators an unfair advantage over competitors.\u201d The Drax conversion project in North Yorkshire is one of several selected under a UK support measure for renewable energy projects. The plans went to the EU last April for consideration. The commission says it is concerned that the estimates of a fully converted plant\u2019s economic performance might be too conservative and that this could lead to overcompensation. It is also worried about the number of wood pellets required and whether the sheer quantity could distort competition in the biomass market. A Drax spokesman said: \u201cWe welcome this announcement as the next step towards the full conversion of our third generating unit from coal to sustainable biomass. A positive outcome will result in half our power station running on biomass. \u201cThis will improve the security of UK electricity supply and, in saving more than 12 million tonnes of carbon per year, play a critical role in helping the UK meet its climate change targets. Shares in the group fell more than 4.5% to 221p as investors feared the uncertainty the EC decision would bring, though Angelos Anastasiou of Whitman Howard said a decision in Drax\u2019s favour might come sooner than expected.

The upmarket department store said underlying pre-tax profits fell 30% to \u00a313.9m (from \u00a319.8m the year before) in the year to 28 March 2015, as sales remained level year-on-year at \u00a3193m. The retailer said it had begun to update its Knightsbridge flagship store last year and would complete a refurbishment of its ground floor, including its beauty and accessories department, by Christmas 2016. It will also be expanding deliveries from its website into new overseas markets after launching a Hong Kong site last autumn. \u201cWe anticipate that the trading climate for luxury retail will continue to be uncertain and as such retailers need to work even harder to stand out and deliver a strong, differentiated and compelling customer proposition,\u201d the company said. Separate accounts for the flagship Knightsbridge store show its sales fell 2.4% to \u00a392.5m while Harveynichols.com increased sales by nearly 27%, to \u00a311.1m. Luxury retailers had a tough year in 2015 as spending by Chinese tourists was affected by a clampdown on giving business gifts in China while the strength of the pound made shopping in mainland Europe more attractive than London for many visitors. Last year, Harvey Nichols opened a new larger store in Birmingham and aborted a move into Azerbaijan just four months after opening in the oil-rich state which has been widely criticised for human rights abuses. The group now has seven stores within the UK and Ireland, including five large stores in London, Edinburgh, Birmingham, Leeds and Manchester, and two small stores in Bristol and Dublin. There\u2019s also a beauty store, Beauty Bazaar, in Liverpool and seven large stores overseas in Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Dubai, Hong Kong and Kuwait.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "This time last year the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) made a compelling case for keeping interest rates at their historic lows, arguing that although the recovery looked to be on an increasingly sure footing, we were some way off generating inflation through domestic wage pressure, and that if anything, the global growth slowdown meant inflation looked set to fall below 1% in the coming year. That view now looks prescient, to say the least. Consumer price inflation spent another month at near-zero levels in November, with prices by the CPI measure a mere 0.1% higher on average than a year ago. This makes it a virtual certainty that 2015 will be a year of zero or near-zero consumer price inflation: the first time this will have happened in the CPI\u2019s 27-year history. This is not just a UK phenomenon: consumer prices have stalled across developed countries, primarily as a result of steep falls in the price of oil over the last 18 months. Oil price falls feed through to inflation in a relatively simple and predictable way. Initially fuel and energy prices respond, which has the immediate effect of pushing down on both producer and consumer prices. But as reductions in these costs feed through to production, transportation and other input costs, a broader range of goods and services becomes cheaper. This \u2018good\u2019 deflation feels much like a tax cut to consumers, and as long as the economy is growing, it is unlikely to turn into a deflationary spiral. So given that the UK is currently growing at around 2.3%, does this mean deflation shouldn\u2019t concern us as we head into 2016? It\u2019s worth reminding ourselves why falling prices are such a damaging phenomenon. When a deflation sets in, the real value of debt increases, making it more difficult for borrowers to service their debts. And the UK has a lot of borrowers: the household debt-to-income ratio is currently 135% - lower than the pre-crisis peak (155%) but far above its historical average. Indebted households without asset wealth are particularly vulnerable to deflationary dynamics, since they don\u2019t get the offsetting gains of rising real asset prices: in the UK, 70% of tenants (i.e. those without property investments) hold at least one form of unsecured debt, and around one in eight of them report that their debt repayments are a heavy burden. Although it is indeed unlikely, deflation could take hold even in the current context if consumers were convinced that a wide range of products were set to get cheaper, and if they were willing and able to postpone consumption in anticipation of those price falls. That could be enough to cause demand to slow sharply, which would lead firms to cut wages to stay afloat. The key early warning signs are therefore downturns in wages and consumer spending. There is tentative evidence that consumers have been more reluctant to spend of late: after a slow October, retail sales decreased 0.4% on the year in November. But it is the wage data that give the biggest clue as to how inflation expectations have changed. Nominal wage growth has slowed sharply over the past six months: regular pay (excluding bonuses) grew by only 2% in the three months to October compared with a year earlier, down from 2.9% in the three months to July. In month-on-month terms, real wage growth has now been flat for seven months. Although we are still some way away from nominal wage falls, and slowing wage growth can be caused by a number of factors, the data does at this point suggest that expectations are adjusting to a low-inflation environment. A key condition for a deflation to set in is for price falls to be broad based. At its worst, Japan\u2019s deflation affected 70% of all consumer prices. In this respect the data for the UK are encouraging. Recent price falls are almost entirely down to falling goods prices, while the price of services continues to rise strongly. Since service prices tend be more closely tied to domestic demand, this is a reassuring indication that we are some way from a deflationary spiral \u2013 although if we were in the early stages of a deflation, we would see it in goods prices first. Looking ahead to 2016, the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee should be poised to loosen policy further should price falls show any signs of becoming entrenched. And given how important income growth is for staying out of deflationary territory,George Osborne has another good reason (if one were needed) to avoid any tax or welfare measures that would have the effect of cutting incomes \u2013 particularly for those at the bottom of the income distribution, who tend to spend all that they receive \u2013 in the coming year.

There\u2019s not a lot you can do. When it\u2019s warm in winter people don\u2019t buy T-shirts and shorts,\u201d said chief executive Lord Wolfson. It was the mildest December in the UK since records began and Next provided a graph to show the impact of the weather on its sales. Full price sales at the group\u2019s high street chain fell by 0.5% between 26 October and 24 December while sales at the Next\u2019s catalogue and online business, Directory, rose just 2%. Overall sales were up by 0.4%, below City forecasts of around 4%. Wolfson said increasing competition online \u2013 in terms of delivery options and discounting \u2013 and poor product availability had also hit performance. \u201cA lot of competitors have got their act together this year. It is partly about delivery cut-off times while this time last year quite a few people had operational issues and that didn\u2019t happen again.\u201d He said Next\u2019s Directory sales were probably 2% lower than they could have been as it had under-estimated the growing influence of its website in comparison to its big seasonal catalogue. That meant Next had not stocked up on enough of the fresh products which it releases later in the season which are not featured in the big book. Next is now changing the way it buys product to account for the different way people shop; Wolfson said the new system would be fully in place by next autumn. However, he admitted that the company would have to be \u201ccautious on the UK element of the Next brand\u201d and that the main opportunities for growth were taking Next overseas online and expanding its Label catalogue which sells other brands. The group has revised its full-year profit estimate to \u00a3817m, an increase of 4.4% on the previous year. This is at the lower end of its previous range of between \u00a3810m and \u00a3845m, although Wolfson said the figure could increase or decrease by \u00a37m depending on how January trading. Analysts said Next\u2019s sales performance, particularly at the Directory, was disappointing and raised fears it would now struggle to achieve growth, but profits had held up surprisingly well. This was partly because Next remained aloof from the widespread discounting that swept the retail sector ahead of Christmas, starting its sale on Boxing Day. The company said it had maintained profit margins as a result. \u201cThe disappointing Directory results are likely to ressurect concerns about the maturity of the channel. Next, however, has an outstanding record and has achieved guidance even if it is at the lower end of the range in a volatile trading environment,\u201d said Freddie George at Cantor Fitzgerald. The disappointing performance from Next over the festive period will raise fears that other retailers, which took part in the rash of discounting before Christmas, will have fared even worse, particularly Marks &amp; Spencer and Debenhams. M&amp;S is due to update the market on Thursday while John Lewis reports on Wednesday. Shares in Next were the biggest fallers in the FTSE 100, dropping by almost 5%, to \u00a368.50. Shares in M&amp;S fell 1.5% to 428.5p. Richard Hunter, head of equities at Hargreaves Lansdown Stockbrokers, said that Next had provided \u201ca stark reminder that the situation within retail is precarious.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Construction firms ended 2015 in party mood after a recovery in housebuilding during December. According to the Markit/Cips UK construction purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI), housebuilders set aside a difficult year to invest more heavily in new plots after the general election created uncertainty over government policy. Commercial building in UK cities also held up well to push the December index to 57.8, up from a seven-month low of 55.3 in the previous month, where a figure above 50 indicates an expansion in activity. George Osborne\u2019s offer of a \u00a312bn boost to infrastructure spending over the next five years gave the outlook for construction a lift, coupled with the government\u2019s determination to encourage an increase in housebuilding on green- and brownfield sites, which has been frustrated in recent years. Markit said more than half of the survey panel anticipated a rise in business activity over the course of 2016, while only 7% forecast a reduction. Commercial activity performed well in December and the civil engineering sector, a proxy for the infrastructure sector, struggled \u2013 but their fortunes appear to be reversing. Commercial builders have reached the end of a cycle in London that has pushed land prices to new highs, discouraging further speculative building. The relative decline of regional centres to the benefit of the capital, dampening demand for new office space, has denied them a route out of the south-east. Max Jones, a construction specialist at Lloyds Bank, said: \u201cWhile 2015 appears to have ended on a high, sentiment about the outlook for this year will likely depend on which part of the sector you look at. Commercial construction is beset by uncertainty in the regions and price pressures in London and the south-east, yet housebuilding remains boosted by government measures to increase demand.\u201d Tim Moore, an economist at Markit, said: \u201cCivil engineering remained the weakest performing area of construction in December. Nonetheless, civil engineering activity looks set to experience a near-term spike at the turn of 2016 from spending related to flood relief and additional capital budgets.\u201d Infrastructure spending on flagship projects including the Thames Tideway and Hinkley Point nuclear power station are expected to give more work to civil engineering firms over the next few years. But Kalpana Padhiar, a construction analyst at the global credit insurer Euler Hermes, warned that the sector was still recovering from backing unprofitable projects during and after the financial crash. \u201cDecember\u2019s figures undoubtedly bring a positive end to 2015, but risk masking the challenges faced by a sector still nursing its wounds. While many across the sector can now afford to be more selective about the work they take on, the major headwinds are unlikely to drop as we move into 2016. Rising capital pressures, an increasing skills gap and a potential interest rate hike suggest firms should continue to proceed with caution,\u201d she said. \u2022 This article was amended on 6 January 2016.

      "bodyText": "FRShares in Volkswagen fell after the US Justice Department sued the German automaker over emissions-cheating software fitted to diesel vehicles. Volkswagen\u2019s shares slumped 3.1% to \u20ac122.45 in Frankfurt trading on Tuesday morning \u2013 easily the worst performer on the DAX index, which was 0.4% higher overall. The Justice Department\u2019s move on Monday potentially exposes the company to billions in fines for clean air violations. Volkswagen set aside \u20ac6.7bn (\u00a34.9bn) to deal with the costs of recalling and fixing cars after the scandal erupted in September, but the ultimate costs to the company are expected to be considerably higher. A number of private class-action lawsuits filed by angry VW owners is also pending. After the regulator uncovered the scandal in September, VW admitted installing the software, which was designed to trick regulators into believing its cars were less polluting than they really were by producing low emissions only when undergoing official tests, in more than 11m vehicles across the world. The allegations in the lawsuit, brought on behalf of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), carry penalties that could cost Volkswagen more than $30,000 (\u00a320,400) per vehicle, which could total as much as $18bn. The emissions scandal has already wiped tens of billions of euros off VW\u2019s share price, and analysts have warned that the total cost of the scandal could be as high as \u20ac78bn, which would be 60% more than the Deepwater Horizon disaster cost BP.",

      "bodyText": "After Monday\u2019s rout, markets are attempting to stage a rebound, but it is hardly a convincing one. The FTSE 100, having fallen more than 2% on the first trading day of the year, is now up 9.58 points or just 0.16% at 6103.02 having earlier climbed to 6166. Worries about a slowdown in China sent global markets tumbling and despite intervention by the country\u2019s central bank, those concerns remain. There are some reasonable risers, however, with Royal Mail leading the FTSE 100, up 10.9p at 447.9p. The increase follows a positive note from Cantor Fitzgerald, which raised its recommendation from hold to buy with a target price increased from 500p to 530p. Analyst Robin Byde said: Royal Mail has made good progress cutting costs, lifting productivity and introducing new products. We believe that the strengths and value of the company\u2019s established networks and brands, in the fast changing delivery world, are underappreciated. We also think that market concerns about wage negotiations, future pension costs and regulation are overstated. The stock is good value, trading on a calendar 2016 estimated PE of 10.5 times versus the wider sector on 15.1 times and other European postal companies on 13.1 times. Our forecast dividend has a yield of 5%. We think that the near-term risk of higher contributions to support the defined benefit [pension] scheme is limited but a broad-based settlement on future pension provision is needed. Ofcom, the UK regulator, is looking again at the regulation of Royal Mail but we do not expect a radical shift in policy as much of what Royal Mail does is already exposed to stiff competition. Royal Mail will shortly start a new round of wage negotiations. These could be tricky but we build-in higher costs. Regarding wages and pensions and the impact on future dividends, we note that employees own around 12% of the company. Tesco is also in favour, up 2.05p to 144.30p after Deutsche Bank moved from hold to buy. The bank said: We believe Tesco\u2019s UK margin progression can outpace rivals despite lacklustre like for like sales and forecast a 2.2% UK EBIT margin by 2018/19. But still with retail, Next has fallen 375p or 5% to \u00a368.15 after a disappointing update which it blamed on unseasonably warm weather in the run up to Christmas. Rival Marks &amp; Spencer has fallen in sympathy, down 5.7p at 429.6p while Primark owner Associated British Foods is 27p lower at \u00a332.49. Elsewhere Aberdeen Asset Management has fallen 14.1p to 267.9p after Barclays cut from equal weight to underweight. The bank\u2019s analysts said: The Aberdeen share strongly underperformed in 2015, down 33% versus the average UK Asset Manager in our coverage universe up 16%. It is tempting to view the share as solely a macro call on emerging market sentiment. However, we highlight that significant other areas remain vulnerable to outflow risk... We forecast a slowing of group outflows to \u00a320bn in 2016 (from \u00a334bn in 2015) but believe that risks are to the downside. With a significantly lower asset base in 2016 yoy, revenue declines of 13% year on year are projected. Cost rationalization plans appear modest in response. The share is trading at 12.6 times calendar 2016 PE for a projected 25% decline in earnings per share year on year. But miners have edged higher after Monday\u2019s Chinese concerns, with Glencore up 2.27p to 87.54p.",

      "bodyText": "Australian shares have closed down sharply as uncertainty about the direction of the Chinese economy and markets saw volatile trading across Asia Pacific. The benchmark S&amp;P/ASX200 index finished down 1.6% or 86 points at 5,184 points at the close of trade on Tuesday while shares on the Shanghai Composite index (SSE) yo-yoed wildly despite renewed intervention by the Chinese authorities. Chinese shares dropped 7% on Monday before trade was suspended, and the gloom spread around the world with New York, London, Paris and Frankfurt all finishing the day sharply down. Markets were braced for more selling on Tuesday and the SSE slipped 3% at the opening of trade before rallying into positive territory on the back of US$19bn cash injection into the money markets by the People\u2019s Bank of China and hints by the securities regulator that it would restrict share sales by large institutions. However, the selling started up again in the afternoon and the SSE was down 2,76% at 5.30pm AEDT. The Australian dollar suffered too, falling to a two-week low. On Tuesday, the local unit was buying US72.11c, down from US72.17c on Monday after earlier dropping to US71.56c. \u201cIt does look like the Australian market will remain under pressure,\u201d CMC Markets chief market strategist Michael McCarthy said. \u201cThat weakening Aussie dollar is a positive, as is the continuing rise in iron ore, but I suspect in this global wave of weak sentiment those factors will be ignored and instead the key factor for today will be the performance of the markets in Shanghai and Shenzhen.\u201d The big four banks led the ASX/S&amp;P200 lower in Australia while the miners BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto and energy companies were also down. Electronics retailer Harvey Norman was up slightly, possibly benefiting from the continued travails of competitor Dick Smith, which went into voluntary administration on Tuesday. Elsewhere in the region, the Nikkei index in Japan also had an up-and-down day. It started down up to 0.5% before shooting back into the black on the back of the China intervention, but was trading flat after the lunchbreak. Poor Chinese manufacturing data released on 1 January sparked Monday\u2019s jitters and the latest setting for the yuan on Tuesday provided further evidence that the authorities in Beijing want the currency to weaken to bolster exports. The People\u2019s Bank of China set the midpoint rate at 6.5169 per US dollar prior to market open on Tuesday, weaker than the previous fix of 6.5032, its lowest level since 2011. Chris Weston at IG Markets in Melbourne earlier identified an article in the People\u2019s Daily as one reason for Monday\u2019s selling. It said that \u201ctraditional Keynes theory has its limits\u201d and had a strong focus \u201con overcapacity, lowering costs and removing \u2018zombie\u2019 companies\u201d, suggesting to the markets that 2016 will see some rationalisation in China\u2019s huge state-owned sector. Tension in the Middle East may also play a part in how the markets react this week. Saudi Arabia cut ties with Iran on Sunday after Iranian protesters attacked its mission there, angered by the Sunni Muslim kingdom\u2019s decision to execute a leading Shia cleric, while Islamic State militants promised renewed attacks on western countries. Bank of New Zealand currency strategist Jason Wong said there were heavy falls on equity markets and most currencies as traders played it safe. \u201cThere was enough bad news lurking around before the beginning of the European/US trading sessions, but manufacturing data added to the concerns,\u201d he said. \u201cThe combination of geopolitical concerns in the Middle East, weak economic data in China and the US, and thin holiday trading markets was a deadly one that saw some big moves.\u201d",
