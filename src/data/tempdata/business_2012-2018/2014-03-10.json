      "bodyText": "The board committee that sets pay at the troubled Co-operative Group is expected to meet this week to discuss extending controversial retention payments to more members of the newly assembled top management team. The committee, chaired by university lecturer Eric Calderwood, has already discussed such payments for some executives, including the new boss Euan Sutherland, who is on course to be paid \u00a33.6m for 2013 and \u00a33m for 2014 as a result. The revelations about the pay schemes for Sutherland and seven other members of his executive team in the Observer have already been described as \"disappointing\" by Chris Leslie, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, one of the 32 members of parliament who belong to the Labour and Co-operative parties. The expos\u00e9 has led to speculation that the Co-op board \u2013 comprising 20 members of the co-operative movement and former City minister and former chairman of Guardian Media Group Lord Myners \u2013 is in turmoil. The new boss of the Co-op Bank, Niall Booker, risks inflaming the row over pay by admitting it is considering whether to side-step the European Union cap on bankers' bonuses by asking shareholders to pay bonuses worth twice their salaries. The EU restrictions limit bonuses to 100% of salary or 200% with approval from shareholders. Booker told the Financial Times: \"We need to be willing to pay people to take career risk.\" The bank is 30% owned by the Co-op Group after a \u00a31.5bn rescue led by bondholders, including US hedge funds, which now own the rest. Sutherland, whose \u00a31.5m salary is higher than that of any chief of a FTSE 100 company, is preparing to announce management changes next Monday, if not before, in advance of full-year results on 26 March which are expected to show losses of at least \u00a32bn. He intends to promote the finance director, Richard Pennycook \u2013 who used to be finance director at supermarket chain Morrisons \u2013 to chief operating officer, and it is thought he wants to make new appointments to the executive committee. Sutherland, the former boss of B&amp;Q who took the helm of the group on 1 May, needs to name a permanent replacement for head of human resources, Rebecca Skitt, who left last month with a \u00a32m payoff. While retention payments for the existing members of the executive committee have been approved, it is thought that approval has not yet been granted for new members of his team. Sutherland, who does not have a seat on the board, is in the throes of devising a strategy that has already involved putting the farms business up for sale and has led to speculation about thousands of job cuts at the organisation, which is facing losses because of problems at its bank. The pay policies were not intended to be made public until the annual report was published alongside the losses and come amid heightened scrutiny of executive pay deals. The results are expected to be followed by the outcome of a review by Sir Christopher Kelly into what went wrong at the bank, which is likely to review the role of the group's board. For 2013, Sutherland's \u00a31.5m salary \u2013 of which he received \u00a31m as he worked for eight months of last year \u2013 is enhanced by a \u00a31.5m retention package, which does not have performance conditions, plus \u00a31m to buy him out of share deals at B&amp;Q-owner Kingfisher. In 2014 he will receive a \u00a31.5m salary and \u00a31.5m of retention payments. Sarah Wilson, chief executive of the proxy pay service Manifest, said of Sutherland's salary: \"This is all speculation at the moment but by any measure our analysis shows that the figures proposed do not relate to any current FTSE 100 salary.\" The Co-op argues that if it was a listed company and not a mutual owned by its members, it would be one of the 30 largest companies listed on the London Stock Exchange and that it had to introduce the payments because its current long-term incentive plans will not pay out because of the losses at the group. The scale of the board pay deals came as Booker was writing to customers to thank them for \"standing by us during some of the most difficult times in our history\". He is attempting to stabilise the bank, which is expected to be loss-making for three years, and wrote to say he was focused on \"providing great customer service and meeting your day-to-day banking needs\". Among the customers is Lord Oakeshott, whose Olim Property investment business banks with the Co-op. The Liberal Democrat peer said after receiving a letter: \"Customers like my company have been very loyal to the Co-op Bank through their recent troubles because we believed they weren't bonus junkies like the other banks but our patience is now sorely strained.\"",

Except when it comes to executive pay, he should have added, because the sums being proposed for the Co-op's new executive class deliberately try to ape rewards on offer at big UK quoted companies. Sutherland himself is due to collect \u00a33.6m this year \u2013 a mix of a \u00a31.5m salary, a \u00a31.5m retention payment and cash to buy him out of incentive schemes at his last employer, Kingfisher, where he ran B&amp;Q. Under the proposals, the top eight executives will together be paid about \u00a312m this year, twice what the Co-op's old crew earned. That's the price of decent management, seems to be the view of the board (or, rather, part of the board since it's obvious not everybody is happy). It's certainly true the Co-op needed superior management. And, yes, it would be possible for an imaginative remuneration consultant to construct a spreadsheet showing that, even though Sutherland's salary will be bigger than that of any chief executive of a FTSE 100 company, his total package is somehow the \"going rate\" because the Co-op, as a mutual, hasn't got a share price and thus can't dangle share options in front of its executives. But common sense says the Co-op ought to look further than the FTSE 100 index if it wants to sustain the mantra about \"being different\". Employee-owned John Lewis doesn't feel the need to pay its top executives like Marks &amp; Spencer's does. At the Nationwide Building Society, the chief executive can get within a whisker of \u00a33m but only if all performance targets are met. By contrast, Sutherland hasn't yet set out his strategy \u2013 that will happen later this month. Sutherland's response to the leak of the pay proposals was to rail against the leaker. \"We seem to have an individual, or individuals, determined to undermine me personally, my team and the rest of the Group Board,\" he wrote on Facebook. Calm down. It would not be surprising if noses are out of joint on the Co-op's various committees-cum-power bases: not everybody, even after the calamities, accepts the need for root-and-branch reform. But it's hard to understand what Sutherland gains by creating a class of member called \"disaffected people\" when, officially, he's still in the business of soliciting views about the Co-op's future. Sutherland clearly doesn't like leaks \u2013 few bosses do. But he should know that it is possible to be in favour of both reinvention of the Co-op and an approach to boardroom pay that rewards success only when it has been achieved. The two may even go hand in hand.",

    "webTitle": "As Poundland IPO approaches, founder says: 'I'm very proud, it's my baby'", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "\"Yes, I'll be looking at buying shares,\" says Steve Smith enthusiastically as he contemplates the imminent \u00a3750m stock market listing of Poundland, the retailer he founded in 1990. \"I'm very proud. It's my baby and they've looked after it. I'm seeing my dreams for Poundland come true.\" Smith has come a long way from the days when he worked all hours helping his dad, Keith, earn a living from the family's stall in Bilston market in the west Midlands. In stockinged feet he pads around his Shropshire mansion. It's your typical millionaire's playground: grand hallway decked with giant chandeliers; mock pub; snooker room and swimming pool. The helipad on the front lawn means he can lift off from the doorstep, the family's pet llamas white specks on the horizon as he swooshes over the 50-acre estate. Not bad for an entrepreneur who recalls helping his mum colour in the pattern on the family's threadbare carpets with oil paints when he was a child. With investors keen to get a piece of recession darling Poundland, the shares are expected to be priced on Wednesday close to or at the top of the 250p to 300p range indicated by its advisers. The IPO is set to create another generation of Poundland millionaires as 155 senior managers own a 25% stake that could be worth close to \u00a3190m. The majority belongs to nine directors, including chief executive Jim McCarthy, who banked \u00a35m when US private equity fund Warburg Pincus acquired its 75% stake for \u00a3200m four years ago. But their payday will not be as big as Smith's. He shared \u00a350m with his father and business partner Dave Dodd when the business was sold for the first time in 2002. His wife Tracey's car numberplate says it all: \"5WAG\", or swag. Smith opened the first Poundland store in Burton upon Trent in December 1990, aided by a \u00a350,000 loan from his father \u2013 who had gone on to build and then sell a cash-and-carry business \u2013 and unwavering confidence that a market stall-style retailer could successfully transfer to the high street. \"It was the first one-price shop on the high street in a prime position,\" he says of a business model inspired by the cardboard box on the family stall with damaged goods that were sold off for 10p. \"It was really popular. The box always sold out.\" In the early days landlords and suppliers turned up their noses, although the shopping centre in Burton upon Trent relented because it was struggling to let units. But it was a success from the off, with the store shifting \u00a313,000 worth of stock on the first day. \"We wanted to break into brands but they didn't want to know,\" says Smith. Its first big name was WD-40 and the poor terms of the deal meant it lost 3p a can. However it would go on to become one of the US company's biggest customers. With more than 500 stores, Poundland does not have to work quite so hard to sell itself today. Fixed-price retailers have benefited from the conversion of middle-class shoppers to discount stores such as Aldi and Lidl, with the retailer now claiming that one in five of its shoppers are drawn from the wealthy AB socioeconomic groups. Stores in affluent towns such as Cambridge, Stratford-upon-Avon and Bath generate higher sales than the average Poundland store. Despite his market stall trader background, it is clear the softly spoken Smith is no Del Boy. He sheepishly confesses to a love of software. \"I always put a lot of work into software because I knew I couldn't be in every store,\" he says. At 51, he is not content to while away his time driving his bright yellow Lamborghini convertible along the country lanes near his home or on impromptu jam sessions with his son \u2013 his organ-playing competes to be heard above Joe's drums. He often wakes in the early hours to send emails or monitor a diverse portfolio of investments that includes Greenfield Capital, which offers bridging loans to property developers, and the website Estates Direct. He is inundated with thousands of emails from entrepreneurs seeking advice or backing; last year he started the Funding Club, which aims to connect wealthy private investors with startups. His new \"baby\" is Poundshop.com \u2013 strapline \"Yes! Everything is still \u00a31\" \u2013 which got off to a rocky start last month when the volume of traffic kept crashing the website. Like Poundland, the eclectic product mix spans dog food to party plates and e-cigarettes, and Smith believes it will be a hit with shift workers and other shoppers, such as disabled people, who find it more difficult to get to the shops. \"It's the same treasure hunt-type experience as going into a store like Poundland,\" explains Smith, who reports peaks in traffic at 11pm and 3am, with pregnancy tests a surprise bestseller. \"You never know what you're going to find and the aim is to add 100 new items each day so our customers can always find something new.\" In the hallway, framed sketches of the first Poundland store hang alongside football memorabilia and the Smith heraldic shield his wife obtained from the US. On the eve of the IPO, does he regret the decision to sell up? A supplier approached him in the late 1990s with a cheque for \u00a320m but he wavered. \"My dad said take it, but I wasn't ready,\" says Smith, who at the time was preoccupied with a warehouse opening. Delays at that site would wipe out the following year's profits, and the prospective buyer walked away. \"When we met again he had the cheque off me and ripped it up. I decided then that the next opportunity I got, I'd sell. I know people who were too greedy and lost it all.\" Market stall roots Three of the country biggest retailers, Tesco, Morrisons and Marks &amp; Spencer, can all be traced back to entrepreneurial stallholders striving in bustling city markets. \"Lots of retailers start on market stalls because that is where you learn buying and selling,\" says Steve Smith. Jack Cohen founded Tesco selling surplus groceries from a market stall in London's East End in 1919. He sold the first Tesco product \u2013 Tesco Tea \u2013 five years later when he bought a tea shipment from a merchant called TE Stockwell and combined their initials on the packaging. Rival grocer Morrisons is also proud of its links to Rawson market in Bradford, where William Morrison started out selling eggs and butter in 1899. His son, who would become Sir Ken Morrison, joined in 1952 and led the grocer to a stock market flotation in 1968. It still calls the fresh meat and fish counters in its stores \"market street\". Marks &amp; Spencer's heart, meanwhile, is in Kirkgate market in Leeds, where Michael Marks, a Polish refugee, joined forces with a local book-keeper Thomas Spencer to launch a penny bazaar in 1884. Next to the stall was a poster with the words 'Don't Ask the Price, It's a Penny'.",

      "body": "<p>\"Yes, I'll be looking at buying shares,\" says Steve Smith enthusiastically as he contemplates the imminent \u00a3750m stock market listing of Poundland, the retailer he founded in 1990. \"I'm very proud. It's my baby and they've looked after it. I'm seeing my dreams for Poundland come true.\"</p> <p>Smith has come a long way from the days when he worked all hours helping his dad, Keith, earn a living from the family's stall in Bilston market in the west Midlands. In stockinged feet he pads around his Shropshire mansion. It's your typical millionaire's playground: grand hallway decked with giant chandeliers; mock pub; snooker room and swimming pool. The helipad on the front lawn means he can lift off from the doorstep, the family's pet llamas white specks on the horizon as he swooshes over the 50-acre estate.</p> <p>Not bad for an entrepreneur who recalls helping his mum colour in the pattern on the family's threadbare carpets with oil paints when he was a child.</p> <p>With investors keen to get a piece of recession darling Poundland, the shares are expected to be priced on Wednesday close to or at the top of the 250p to 300p range indicated by its advisers. The IPO is set to create another generation of Poundland millionaires as 155 senior managers own a 25% stake that could be worth close to \u00a3190m. The majority belongs to nine directors, including chief executive Jim McCarthy, who banked \u00a35m when US private equity fund Warburg Pincus acquired its 75% stake for \u00a3200m four years ago.</p> <p>But their payday will not be as big as Smith's. He shared \u00a350m with his father and business partner Dave Dodd when the business was sold for the first time in 2002. His wife Tracey's car numberplate says it all: \"5WAG\", or swag.</p> <p>Smith opened the first Poundland store in Burton upon Trent in December 1990, aided by a \u00a350,000 loan from his father \u2013 who had gone on to build and then sell a cash-and-carry business \u2013 and unwavering confidence that a market stall-style retailer could successfully transfer to the high street.</p> <p>\"It was the first one-price shop on the high street in a prime position,\" he says of a business model inspired by the cardboard box on the family stall with damaged goods that were sold off for 10p. \"It was really popular. The box always sold out.\"</p> <p>In the early days landlords and suppliers turned up their noses, although the shopping centre in Burton upon Trent relented because it was struggling to let units. But it was a success from the off, with the store shifting \u00a313,000 worth of stock on the first day. \"We wanted to break into brands but they didn't want to know,\" says Smith. Its first big name was WD-40 and the poor terms of the deal meant it lost 3p a can.

      "bodyText": "And while Cyprus gets a new bank governor, Greece continues to remain at odds with its own creditors at the EU, ECB and IMF at the start of another meeting of eurozone finance ministers in Brussels. Helena Smith writes: Going into today\u2019s meeting, Dutch finance minister and euro group chairman Jeroen Dijsselbloem once again expressed his hope that debt-stricken Greece would finally complete a long-delayed review of its economy with the international organisations keeping its finances afloat. \u201cIt is very important for all of us and especially Greece that an agreement is reached,\u201d he told reporters this afternoon. Without agreement on, inter alia a host of structural reforms, creditors have refused to disburse the next tranche of aid, at \u20ac10.1bn vital to meeting debt repayments in May. With crucial European parliament elections in May, prime minister Antonis Samaras\u2019 fragile two-party coalition is now desperate for a deal to be clinched by early April when an informal Ecofin meeting is next scheduled to take place. The government has promised to rush a host of reforms through parliament this week when troika mission heads are expected to return to the capital. But as finance minister Yannis Stournaras flew to Brussels late Sunday he did so in the knowledge that much still divides the two sides. Sources close to the troika speak of \u201cintense differences\u201d over capital requirement for banks \u2013 dismissing the government\u2019s estimate of \u20ac6.4bn as \u201cfar too low.\u201d Lay-offs in the public sector, employers\u2019 contributions and long overdue reforms aimed at liberalizing the economy \u2013 demanded by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development months ago - have also got in the way of a deal being reached. And on that note it\u2019s time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. A suggestion as to the new head of the Cyprus central bank: That last link reveals: Chrystalla Georghadji [was] born in 1956 in Famagusta, where she lived until 1974, when her family was displaced by the Turkish invasion of Cyprus, she now resides in Limassol, Cyprus, with her two children. Having studied economics at the University of Athens, she continued her studies at the University of Southampton in the U.K. and in 1983 took her Masters degree from the University of Chicago, in the USA. In 1981 she was appointed as an economic officer at the Ministry of Finance. In 1991 she was promoted to the post of Senior Economic Officer in the same Ministry. In 1995, she was appointed as Assistant Superintendent of Insurance and had the responsibility of heading the Service for the Supervision of Insurance Companies in Cyprus. She was also the Deputy Chairperson of the Securities and Exchange Commission of Cyprus for the period 1993-1998. On 1st December 1998 she was appointed by the President of the Republic of Cyprus as Auditor General of the Republic. After a reasonable start despite falling Asian markets, Europe lost much of its early gains as investors succumbed to worries about a slowdown in China following poor trade data and concerns about Ukraine. The final scores showed: \u2022 The FTSE 100 fell 23.22 points or 0.35% to 6689.45 \u2022 Germany\u2019s Dax was down 0.91% at 9265.50 \u2022 France\u2019s Cac closed up o.1% at 4370.84 \u2022 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB ended up 0.58% at 20,753.36 \u2022 Spain\u2019s Ibex added 0.3% to 10,194.6 \u2022 The Athens market dipped 0.19% to 1338.67 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 54 points or 0.33% lower . The resignation of Cyprus\u2019 central bank chief will come as a welcome relief to the island\u2019s head of state president Nicos Anastasiades, our correspondent in Athens Helena Smith writes: For all the diplomatic niceties rustled up in the Cypriot president\u2019s acceptance of the central bank governor\u2019s resignation, Antastasiades would be the first to say it is long overdue. For months the two men have been at loggerheads, involved in a war of words that by the standards of sleepy Cyprus have not only injected a rare venom into the island\u2019s politics but also sent tremors though the upper echelons of the European Central Bank. As an appointee of his loathed communist party predecessor, the Cypriot leader had openly accused Demetriades of dragging his feet in dealing with the bailed out island\u2019s worst crisis in decades. Announcing in September that his patience had \u201crun out,\u201d Anastasiades signalled that he had initiated proceedings with the island\u2019s Supreme Court to get the central bank chief removed for not doing his job properly. \u201cMy patience is now at a point where I can no longer simply bear witness to such inaction or the inadequate discharging of duties that only causes harm to the country,\u201d the president had said. \u201cIt saddens me to make such severe remarks publicly but enough is enough.\u201d Among other infractions, the leader had accused the governor of putting personal wellbeing before national duty by deciding to go on holiday during the crisis The threat to oust the governor had unleashed a rare counter-attack by ECB president Mario Draghi who had said such a move would be tantamount to \u201cundermining the independence of the central bank.\u201d Demetriades, who gave up his position as professor for financial economics at the University of Leicester to take up the post in May 2012, had fiercely denied the accusations but thereafter also admitted that his relationship with Anastasiades was \u201cnot a sustainable state of affairs.\u201d His decision to step down follows the resignation of the entire Cypriot cabinet on February 28th after Anastasiades\u2019 junior partner, DIKO, withdrew from the government following the furore over the privatization of semi-government organisations dmanded by the island\u2019s creditors. Insiders said with a whole-scale government reshuffle expected by March 15, the political vacuum offered the perfect opportunity for the central bank governor to tender his resignation without losing face. IMF chief economist Olivier Blanchard believes there is a definite risk of deflation particularly in the eurozone area. The comments come courtesy of German newspaper Handelsblatt ahead of an article to be published on Tuesdayu. And here\u2019s the European Central Bank, which has taken note of the resignation of Cyprus\u2019s central bank governor. It says it is counting on \u201ca fruitful co-operation with his successor.\u201d Here\u2019s the full statement from Cyprus: The Governor of the Central Bank of Cyprus, Mr Panicos Demetriades, today submitted his resignation to the President of the Republic, Mr Nicos Anastasiades, and the resignation was accepted. According to Mr Demetriades\u2019 contract a month\u2019s notice is required, and for that reason his resignation will be effective as of April 10. During this period, Mr Demetriades will deal with the pending issues before him and will brief his successor. Mr Demetriades\u2019 letter of resignation was handed today, in Brussels, to the Minister of Finance, Mr Harris Georgiades, in the presence of a European Central Bank representative. The President of the Republic thanked Mr Demetriades for his contribution in the great effort that has been undertaken over the past year to rescue the country from bankruptcy and to stabilize the financial sector. The reasons for Demetriades resigned were not immediately apparent, said Reuters but added: He has had testy relations with the centre-right government, and [president Nicos] Anastasiades had said in September he was seeking his removal. Demetriades has been in his post for almost two years. A statement from Cyprus\u2019s presidency said Demetriades would work out his notice and step down on April 10. Cyprus central bank governor Panicos Demetriades has resigned according to Reuters, citing two sources. I\u2019m now handing over to my colleague Nick Fletcher. In Dublin, the trial of former executives of Anglo Irish Bank has heard that regulators in London and Dublin made no objection to loans issued by the bank so that clients could buy its shares during the financial crisis. This is from our Ireland correspondent, Henry McDonald: Regulators on both sides of the Irish Sea never raised any \u201cred flags\u201d over controversial loans made to buy for shares in the now defunct Anglo Irish Bank, a Dublin court heard today. At the trial of three Anglo Irish Bank executives, which is turning out to be longest running criminal trial in the Republic, a compliance director at international financiers Morgan Stanley said that neither the UK\u2019s nor Ireland\u2019s financial watchdog expressed concerns over the \u20ac2.4 billion bid to sell shares in the bank in 2008. David Churton, speaking via video link from London into Dublin\u2019s Central Criminal Court, said: \u201cFor us to be speaking to both the Irish regulator and the British regulators that was unusual, that does not happen. If they had raised red flags we would not have executed the transaction, if they could not have mitigated.\u201d He was being questioned about the bid by former billionaire Sean Quinn to buy future shares in Anglo Irish even though the bank was in serious financial trouble by the summer of 2008. Sean FitzPatrick, 65, Willie McAteer, 63, and Pat Whelan, 51, have pleaded not guilty to 16 charges of providing unlawful loans for clients to buy shares in the bank. The trio have pleaded not guilty to providing unlawful financial assistance to individuals in July 2008 for the purchase of shares in the bank, contrary to Section 60 of the Irish Republic\u2019s Companies Act. Whelan has also pleaded not guilty to a further seven charges of being privy to the fraudulent alteration of loan facility letters to seven individuals. The trial continues. Mothercare has announced an interim chief executive to mind the store after the abrupt departure of Simon Calver last month. Mark Newton-Jones takes over in the hotseat next Monday though he won\u2019t join the board and the company will keep looking for a new boss. Newton-Jones overhauled Shop Direct for Sir David and Sir Frederick Barclay before leaving last July. He worked at Next before that. Looks like a good appointment by Mothercare, which was caught out by heavy pre-Christmas discounting that prompted a dire profit warning in January. It now has more time to get someone else in \u2013 unless Newton-Jones finds he likes it there. Alan Parker, chairman of Mothercare, said: We are delighted to have secured the appointment of Mark as our interim CEO. His leadership skills and depth of experience in retailing through stores and online will further enhance our drive to deliver the recovery of the UK business to complement the strong and growing international operations. We look forward to welcoming Mark to Mothercare on 17th March. The Bank of England\u2019s deputy governor Charlie Bean has revealed the Bank\u2019s concerns over the effect a further rise in the value of sterling would have on exports. Bean says exports have been \u201csomewhat disappointing\u201d despite the 25%-plus fall in sterling\u2019s value in the first year and a half of the financial crisis. Here are a few lines of quotes from his speech: Despite the slowdown in our main export markets, that should have been sufficient to give a kick to net exports. The performance of exports \u2013 particularly exports of services \u2013 has, however, to date been somewhat disappointing... Any further appreciation of sterling, which has risen almost 10% in trade-weighted terms since March, would not be particularly helpful in terms of facilitating a rebalancing towards net exports. In the US, Carl Icahn has stepped up his campaign against the management at eBay. Icahn, the veteran activist investor, alleges that John Donahoe, eBay\u2019s chief executive, lost his investors more than $4bn (\u00a32.4bn) when he sold Skype in 2009. You can read his open letter to eBay shareholders here. Icahn is calling for PayPal to be split off from eBay so that there is no repeat and wants two of his nominees appointed to the board. He\u2019s also promising to publish voluminous evidence of what he claims is \u201cthe sordid affair\u201d of the Skype sale. There is contrasting economic news from France and Italy \u2013 the second and third biggest eurozone economies. In France, the central bank predicted growth of just 0.2% for the first quarter - unchanged from an earlier estimate and slower than the 0.3% in the final quarter of 2013. French industrial production fell 0.2% in January from December - a disappointment because economists had expected 0.2% growth. The figure was dragged down by a 4.4% fall in energy production during an unusually warm month. In Italy, industrial production posted its strongest rise in more than two years, gaining 1.0% in January and beating all economists\u2019 forecasts in a Reuters poll. It\u2019s an extra bit of good news for Italy, which crept out of its longest post-war recession at the end of last year. But Italian industrial output is still down about 24% from its most recent peak in 2008. Travelex is the latest company to consider a flotation in a frenzied year for share offers. The retail foreign exchange company is majority owned by private equity firm Apax Partners, which bought its stake in 2005. Announcing healthy sales growth for 2013, Travelex chief executive Peter Jackson said: The secular growth in international travel continues to drive increasing demand for foreign exchange services and higher transaction values through our stores and online. With this positive backdrop and our strong financial performance, we are currently evaluating our strategic options which may include an IPO. Buyout firms are using the revival of equity markets to cash in past investments, many of which they held much longer than they expected because the financial crisis froze the market for initial public offerings (IPOs). The US Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating whether alleged collusion in the foreign exchange market by world\u2019s biggest banks distorted the prices of options and exchange traded funds, Bloomberg reports. Bloomberg broke the story in June that dealers said they shared information about client orders to manipulate benchmark spot rates in the \u00a33tn a day market. The SEC joins other US authorities including the Justice Department, the Federal Reserve and New York\u2019s top banking regulator in investigating the matter. The UK Financial Conduct Authority is looking at the matter and the Bank of England has launched an investigation into its own officials\u2019 involvement in the market. The Bank suspended an employee last week and governor Mark Carney faces questions on the subject from MPs tomorrow. Here, Bloomberg explain\u2019s the SEC\u2019s involvement: Derivatives such as options account for more than half of the $5.3 trillion-a-day foreign-exchange market; the rest is made up of spot transactions. The involvement of the SEC, which regulates certain options and ETFs tied to the rates, shows how manipulation could ripple across a range of financial products. \u201cAny corporation with global operations has to hedge currencies using futures and swaps,\u201d said John Coffee, a securities law professor at Columbia University in New York. \u201cIf the FX market is manipulated, it can create a loss that is passed on to the consumer and shareholders.\u201d Tesco\u2019s finance director Laurie McIlwee could be on his way out in the latest upheaval at the ailing supermarket giant, according to Mark Kleinman at Sky News. Sky reports that some big investors aren\u2019t happy with McIlwee after Tesco ditched a profit margin target last month. To make matters worse, he doesn\u2019t get on with chief executive Philip Clarke, Kleinman reckons. It sounds like it\u2019s early days in the departure process but the Sky story might hurry things along. Continuing tensions in Ukraine are weighing on markets in general and have had a specific impact on Aim-listed Ukrproduct Group, a Ukrainian producer of cheese and other dairy foods. Low consumer confidence, closed markets and the falling currency have combined to hit sales. The shares were down 4.8% in late morning trade at 7.5p \u2013 just above a 52-week low of 7.4p. This is from the company\u2019s stock exchange announcement. The unstable political and economic situation, as to be expected, is having an adverse effect on businesses throughout Ukraine including Ukrproduct Group. The Company revenues in hryvna year-to-date have been below expectations as consumer confidence has fallen, a range of open markets servicing mass and mid-market have closed and a number of agents in other sales channels have withdrawn from the market not least for the reason of bad debt risk. Overall, sales have also been adversely affected as higher unit costs due to a currency devaluation of the hryvna and sustained high raw milk prices has necessitated the consumer price increases. As a result, key categories have experienced lower sales levels. The sales volumes of processed cheese in January-February decreased year-on-year but showed a slight increase in hryvna terms. Sales of packaged butter dropped but in hryvna terms the decrease was less significant than in tonnage. In more company news, Reckitt Benckiser has agreed to buy the rights to K-Y, the leading brand in what it calls \u201cintimate lubricants\u201d. No employees or equipment are changing hands in the deal. Here\u2019s what Reckitt, which also produces Durex condoms, said: K-Y started as a prescription medical device in 1917 and switched to over-the-counter in 1980. The brand\u2019s clinical and professional heritage is unique in the category and is the underpinning to its trusted and professionally endorsed position. It has been the historical innovator in the category and was the brand that built the female intimacy enhancement segment in lubricants... Its addition will immediately transform RB\u2019s sexual well-being category in the USA and Brazil. K-Y will benefit from RB\u2019s strong innovation, brand equity investment and go-to-market capabilities. The main company news today is the sale of Fyffes, the banana producer, to Chiquita Brands International of the US. The all-share deal values Fyffes at about \u00a3314m and creates the world\u2019s biggest banana company with joint revenues of $4.6bn. Chiquita\u2019s chief executive Ed Lonergan will be chairman and Fyffes\u2019 CEO David McCann will be CEO of the new company, ChiquitaFyffes plc, which will be traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). Fyffes was founded in Victorian London and is a familiar name on UK shop shelves but the company has been Irish since 1986. Unsurprisingly, people have seized the punning opportunities made available to them: In more sobering economic news from Asia, China\u2019s exports unexpectedly tumbled in February, sending the trade balance into deficit. Exports in February fell 18.% from a year earlier - much worse than the 6.8% increase forecast in a Reuters poll and down from a 10.% increase in January, official figures showed. Imports rose 10.1%, giving a trade deficit of $23bn against a surplus of $32bn in January. However, many plants and offices closed for long periods over the long Lunar New Year holiday so the figures could have been skewed in the short term. Still, shares fell on the news. The Hong Kong Hang Seng Index dropped 1.8% and Asian shares outside Japan fell 1.4%. Li Heng, an economist at Minsheng Securities in Beijing, told Reuters: February export numbers were a surprise on the downside, and even combined January-February numbers were below market expectations. The data shows that the economy faces relatively big downward pressures and macro-policies need to be loosened a bit. Good morning and welcome to our blog covering today\u2019s world business and economic news. Japan\u2019s economy expanded more slowly than previously estimated at the end of last year, official figures showed. GDP in the world\u2019s third-biggest economy rose an annualised 0.7% in the fourth quarter of 2013 \u2013 down from an earlier estimate of 1.0%. Business investment and consumption were both weaker than thought. The revised figure shows a slowdown from the 0.9% rate for the third quarter and increases expectations that the Bank of Japan will ease monetary policy further to support the economy. Japan\u2019s Nikkei index of shares fell 1% on the news from Friday\u2019s six-week high. Here\u2019s some more detail from Reuters\u2019 story: In a further negative sign for the export-reliant economy, the current account deficit widened to a record 1.589 trillion yen ($15.38 billion), easily exceeding a median estimate for a 1.4 trillion yen deficit as shipments failed to substantially pick up despite a weaker yen. The disappointing data join a recent run of soft indicators that have raised doubts about Prime Minister Shinzo Abe\u2019s strategy to spark sustainable growth through massive monetary and fiscal stimulus, as well as structural reforms. \u201cAbenomics\u201d helped the economy grow above an annual clip of 4 percent in the first half of last year - the best among advanced economies - but growth slowed to below 1 percent in the second half as exports, capital spending and private consumption lagged. Monday\u2019s data come as the BOJ kicked off a two-day policy review and amid growing expectations the central bank will further ease policy as early as next month to steer the economy through some speed bumps. \u201cThe fact that growth slowed sharply marks a failure of Abenomics that depends on the weak yen and the BOJ easing. But (the policies) have neither raised Japan\u2019s growth trend nor improved its current account,\u201d said Hiromichi Shirakawa, chief economist at Credit Suisse in Tokyo. \u201cThe BOJ may have no choice but to ease policy further by increasing risk asset purchases as early as in April, depending on market moves. It could justify such a move by reasoning that this fiscal year\u2019s GDP is likely to undershoot its projection.\u201d",

Brenda Kelly, chief market strategist at IG, said:</p> <blockquote> Just like the sunshine seen in London before midday, the morning's guarded optimism in markets has given way to risk aversion.

      "bodyText": "After a bright start, leading shares succumbed to worries about a slowdown in Chinese growth and the continuing tensions in Ukraine. The FTSE 100 climbed as high as 6757 in early trading as investors seemed to take poor Chinese trade data over the weekend in their stride. But with Wall Street opening lower and mining shares hit by the Chinese news, the leading index ended 23.22 points lower at 6689.45. Brenda Kelly, chief market strategist at IG, said: Just like the sunshine seen in London before midday, the morning's guarded optimism in markets has given way to risk aversion. Reports of gunfire in Crimea indicate how transient the bullish sentiment really was, adding to disappointing trade figures from China that hit mining stocks. The Ukraine situation may not be dominating headlines as it was last week, but today's activity shows that markets remain vulnerable to headline risks. Fresnillo fell 31.5p to 896p while Glencore Xstrata was down 7.85p at 317p and BHP Billiton dropped 26.5p to \u00a318.22. Elsewhere Vodafone lost 8.55p to 230.1p after reports it had offered \u20ac7bn for Spanish cable company Ono. But Rolls-Royce roared ahead 17p to \u00a310.43 after it took control of a power systems joint venture. The aero engine maker announced after the market closed on Friday that it was buying out the stake held by Daimler, the German carmaker, in the Rolls-Royce Power Systems partnership. Finnish engine maker Wartsila fell back as analysts said Rolls was now less likely to bid for the business. Meanwhile Rolls was also reported to have offered to repay \u00a31.8m to the Indian government in an alleged bribery case. Paper maker Mondi added 3p to \u00a310.94 after Citigroup moved from neutral to buy and raised its price target from \u00a311 to \u00a312.60. Pharmaceuticals group Shire edged up 2p to \u00a332.58 following news that Barclays had lifted its price target from \u00a332.75 to \u00a336. Associated British Foods added 7p to \u00a329.76p as analysts at UBS said its Primark discount fashion chain could be worth up to \u00a319bn. British American Tobacco put on 50.5p to 3340.5p after Citigroup put the company on its European focus list and said it could benefit from splashing out some $16bn to buy the 58% of US rival Reynolds American it does not own. But outsourcing group Capita closed 5p lower at \u00a311.26 despite the company beating out rival Serco, down 11p at 471.5p, to become preferred bidder for a ten year \u00a3400m ministry of defence contract to manage military airfields, barracks and weapons ranges.

Charlie Bean, one of the Bank's two deputy governors, said the UK's recent trade performance had been unimpressive despite help from a sharp fall in the value of the currency in the 18 months after the financial crisis broke in the summer of 2007. The pickup in growth since spring 2013 has been accompanied by an increase of almost 10% in the pound's value against a basket of world currencies, and Bean said any further appreciation would be unwelcome. Speaking in Darlington, the Bank's deputy governor for monetary policy said a rebalancing of growth towards exports was needed to ensure Britain's recovery was \"sustained and sustainable\". He said: \"The prerequisites for such a switch of demand towards net exports seemed to have been put in place by the substantial depreciation in sterling that occurred during the financial crisis. Sterling fell more than 25% between the middle of 2007 and the beginning of 2009. \"Despite the slowdown in our main export markets, that should have been sufficient to give a kick to net exports. The performance of exports \u2013 particularly exports of services \u2013 has, however, to date been somewhat disappointing.\" Bean said anecdotal evidence of businesses bringing back to the UK activities that they had previously \"offshored\" could mean it was simply a matter of time before the UK began to close a current account deficit worth 4% of national output in 2013. \"But any further appreciation of sterling, which has risen almost 10% in trade-weighted terms since March, would not be particularly helpful in terms of facilitating a rebalancing towards net exports.\"",

      "bodyText": "The UK economy will exceed its pre-recession peak this summer, according to the latest predictions from British businesses, despite warnings that the recovery is on shaky foundations as a booming housing market stokes consumer confidence . The British Chambers of Commerce had forecast that GDP would overtake its performance in the first quarter of this year in the autumn, but has now brought that forward to the second quarter. Services and manufacturing have been the main drivers of growth according to official data, but the BCC warned that the buoyant outlook concealed long-term challenges. \"We urge the chancellor to use this month's budget wisely by incentivising businesses to hire young people so that the next generation of workers are not left behind,\" said John Longworth, the director general of the BCC, which represents more than 100,000 businesses. According to the BCC, UK GDP \u2013 excluding the impact of inflation \u2013 will reach \u00a3392.8bn in the three months to July, a level not attained since the economy generated \u00a3392.7bn at the beginning of 2008. It now expects GDP to grow 2.8% this year, compared with its forecast of 2.7%. But that is still below the Bank of England's growth forecast of 3.4% this year. The business group predicted wage growth would overtake inflation in the middle of this year, meaning workers will finally see growth in their real earnings. But the forecasts raised concerns that young people are missing out in the recovery, prompting Longworth's warning that school leavers and graduates could be missing out. The youth unemployment rate is predicted to remain almost three times the national average until 2016. Halifax, one of the UK's biggest mortgage lenders, also raised alarm among economic commentators last week when it reported that house prices rose an expectation-shattering 2.4% in February compared with the previous month. Nonetheless, the BCC's cautious optimism was bolstered by a further report showing that businesses in the UK are at their most confident since before the global financial crisis and more upbeat than in any other developed economy, according to a report out on Monday. Growing optimism and hopes of bumper profits this year are reflected in plans to hire new workers and invest more by UK businesses, says a survey of 11,000 companies around the world by data specialists Markit. The buoyant picture contrasts with warnings that Britain's economic recovery is largely built on the precarious benefits of a housing market recovery and risks running out of steam. For the global economy, Markit's global business outlook survey also paints a bright picture, though the growing optimism in advanced economies is in marked contrast to pessimism across the emerging markets. \"Recoveries in the US, eurozone, UK and Japan are looking increasingly sustainable, with companies set to boost their capital spending and hiring at the fastest rates since the financial crisis alongside the brighter outlook,\" said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit.The survey puts global business optimism at a two-year high. The UK leads developed economies on the outlook for growth, hiring, investment and profit expectations. The only emerging economy forging ahead of the UK is Brazil, where the upcoming soccer World Cup and Olympics have buoyed the mood among businesses, Markit said. George Osborne, who presents his budget on 19 March, the penultimate one before a May 2015 general election. The chancellor was dealt a blow last week by a report that claimed he faced a \u00a320bn black hole in the public finances. An analysis of models by the Office for Budget Responsibility by the Financial Times suggested austerity may have to last a year longer than expected because the government will not be able to rely on economic recovery to eliminate part of the deficit. The claims intensified concerns about Britain's low productivity, stemming partly from weak business investment. The BCC forecasts business investment will record \"strong growth\" of 6.6% in 2014, then 5.7% in 2015 and 2016. But by 2016 it will still be slightly lower than in 2008. \"Britain is simply not investing enough,\" said Longworth. After concerns that the recovery has been largely focused on London and the south-east, there is some reassurance that the pick-up is becoming more widespread. Business activity grew in every region of England and in Wales last month and hiring picked up, according to the latest Lloyds Bank commercial banking regional purchasing managers' index (PMI). The West Midlands was the best-performing region, followed by the South East while growth was slower in the East Midlands and North East. The latest survey from the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) also points to more jobs being created in coming months. The survey of 2,814 businesses showed 15% wish to take on more people in the coming quarter and 11% had increased staff in the previous three months. Again, the West Midlands led the pick-up with an above average increase in hiring. The FSB wants Osborne to use next week's Budget to pull off promised reforms in banking and energy and to make it easier for small businesses to invest. FSB national chairman John Allan said: \"That more than half of firms want to grow is a sign to the chancellor to keep the focus on business. \"I believe small firms can do more too \u2013 for instance helping long term unemployed youngsters back to work and as the economy continues to improve, boosting wages for the low-paid.\"",

Services and manufacturing have been the main drivers of growth according to official data, but the BCC warned that the buoyant outlook concealed long-term challenges.</p> <p>\"We urge the chancellor to use this month's budget wisely by incentivising businesses to hire young people so that the next generation of workers are not left behind,\" said John Longworth, the director general of the BCC, which represents more than 100,000 businesses. According to the&#xa0;BCC, UK GDP \u2013 excluding the impact of inflation \u2013 will reach \u00a3392.8bn in the three months to July, a level not attained since the economy generated \u00a3392.7bn at the beginning of 2008.</p> <p>It now expects GDP to grow 2.8% this year, compared with its forecast of 2.7%. But that is still below the Bank of England's growth forecast of 3.4% this year. The business group predicted wage growth would overtake inflation in the middle of this year, meaning workers will finally see growth in their real earnings.</p> <p>But the forecasts raised concerns that young people are missing out in the recovery, prompting Longworth's warning that school leavers and graduates could be missing out. The youth unemployment rate is predicted to remain almost three times the national average until 2016.
