      "bodyText": "Malcolm Turnbull and Scott Morrison got a nice first-year anniversary present this week when Australia recorded its best unemployment rate for three years. Oddly however, they both ignored the news and preferred to talk about the deal they made with Liberal party room on superannuation. When the ABS announced that the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate of 5.6%, the lowest since July 2013 \u2013 that is at any time during the Abbott/Turnbull period of government \u2013 you would have expected the boasting to have been long and loud. And yet there was mostly silence. The employment minister Michaelia Cash gave a brief press conference, and during Senate question time after questions from her own side on superannuation, defence, innovation and science she was asked about the figures \u2013 not exactly it a high priority. Anyone who tuned into the House of Representatives question time, however, would have found nothing to enlighten them on the current state of the labour market. The prime minister was even given a nice broad question about the government\u2019s \u201ccommitment to deliver economic security for Australians\u201d. In his response, the closest he came to talking of the figures was to note that \u201cjobs are growing\u201d. That at least was closer than the treasurer came to mentioning the good figures. All Morrison wanted to talk about was the changes to the superannuation system. The closest anyone came to talking about the actual situation of jobs was Christopher Pyne who told parliament that \u201cwe created over 200,000 jobs in the last 12 months\u201d (it was actually 191,000 in trend terms or 180,000 in seasonally adjusted, so not quite 200,000 let alone \u201cover\u201d). In both houses the big issue was the changes to superannuation. The lack of attention on actual unemployment highlights the triumph of the \u201cbudget is the economy\u201d argument, where anything that reduces the budget deficit is considered an inherent good. It also highlights that despite the impressive overall unemployment rate, the employment situation is not that good. Malcolm Turnbull suggested that \u201cjobs are growing\u201d, but mostly it is part-time jobs that are growing and even overall job growth is slowing dramatically. Last year in the first eight months 191,000 jobs were created; this year it is just 83,900. The situation for full-time work is particularly bad \u2013 there are now 21,000 fewer full-time jobs than there were in December. And August also saw a record set for the level of underemployed workers. So it is no surprise really that the government was happy to focus on superannuation reforms which reduce the budget deficit. And what was the upshot of these reforms? The prime minister noted that 96% of people would be better off or unaffected. Among of those who will \u201cbenefit\u201d are low-income earners who will profit from the government replacing the \u201clow income super contribution,\u201d which is worth up to $500 a year with the \u201clow income superannuation tax offset,\u201d which is worth up to ... err ... $500 a year. And just how adversely affected the remaining 4% will be is up for debate. The high-income-earner-friendly Australian Financial Review headlined an article on the policy with \u201cWealthy are the winners in Coalition\u2019s superannuation deal\u201d. It also led another article explaining what the \u201cchanges mean for you\u201d by noting that \u201cwealthy savers were granted a last chance to stash up to $540,000 from after-tax earnings before the end of the financial year\u201d. So you would be right in wondering just how big a hair cut the very wealthy will be having. It\u2019s worth noting that the savings to the budget are estimated to be roughly $3bn over the next four years. That sounds big until you realise Treasury estimates the amount of revenue foregone through superannuation tax concessions is around $140bn over that same period. And the changes to the policy \u2013 which among other things saw a backflip on the proposal to impose a $500,000 lifetime limit on post-tax contributions \u2013 was not arrived at though some great bipartisan negotiation. The negotiation was all within the Liberal party room and effectively involved giving the disgruntled and very emboldened rightwing of the party room what it wanted. The ALP will pass the changes \u2013 there is no reason not to \u2013 and there will be many a story about backflips or good deal-making, and others about how the government is at least making steps to improve the budget, and how important and good that is. The government for the most part will welcome such stories \u2013 for they will spin the narrative as best they can. And better those stories than focussing on how for the employment situation looks a lots less buoyant than it was 12 months ago when Turnbull took office.",

      "bodyText": "US businesses have warned European leaders they risk a \u201cgrievous self-inflicted wound\u201d unless they overturn Brussels\u2019 demand that Apple pay the Irish government \u20ac13bn (\u00a311.4bn). In an open letter to the leaders of the 28 European Union countries, the Business Roundtable group defended Apple over its tax dispute with the European commission. The US tech giant was ordered to pay \u20ac13bn to Ireland last month, after Brussels ruled that the tax breaks it was given between 1991 and 2015 amounted to unlawful state aid. But the group of US chief executives, who between them run companies with $7tn of revenue and 16 million employees, said the decision \u201cmust not be allowed to stand\u201d. \u201cThe precedent set by this decision, if upheld, would increase uncertainty significantly with a consequent adverse effect on foreign investment in Europe, making this decision a grievous self-inflicted wound for the European Union and its citizens.\u201d It said that non-EU countries would interpret the ruling \u2013 if left unchallenged \u2013 as a signal that companies could have their assets seized by states \u201cseeking extra revenue or seeking to punish a successful foreign competitor\u201d. Business Roundtable said the 185 chief executives who it counts as members were particularly aggrieved by the retrospective nature of the ruling on a tax deal reached in 1991. \u201cCommercial success is uncertain for any business endeavour but companies should have complete confidence that sovereign countries are committed to honouring their laws and have the authority to do so,\u201d they wrote. \u201cThe retroactive nature of the EC decision means that business can never have certainty even on its past tax liability unless or until the EC chooses to decide accordingly.\u201d Apple chief executive, Tim Cook, has previously labelled the multibillion pound demand \u201ctotal political crap\u201d and warned that it could affect investment in the EU. The letter from Business Roundtable, which was also sent to senior politicians including the German finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, the European Union president, Donald Tusk, and the US secretary of state, John Kerry, echoed the threat. It said the commission\u2019s actions \u201cpromote tax uncertainty \u2013 and unless overturned they will disrupt trade and investment, with the most direct consequences to be borne directly by EU countries and their citizens\u201d. The letter called on member states to \u201cput an end to the use of state aid investigations that will hamper economic growth by undermining cross-border investment\u201d. The group has previously lashed out against what it perceives as Europe\u2019s \u201cnew and dangerous form of protectionism\u201d amid tax investigations into American firms such as Starbucks, McDonald\u2019s and Amazon. The commission\u2019s ruling against Apple was based on its objection to an agreement allowing Apple to pay a maximum tax rate of just 1%. In 2014, the tech firm paid tax at 0.005%. The usual rate of corporation tax in Ireland is 12.5%. The commission said Ireland\u2019s tax arrangements with Apple between 1991 and 2015 had allowed the US company to attribute sales to a \u201chead office\u201d that only existed on paper and could not have generated such profits. The result was that Apple avoided tax on almost all the profit generated from its multibillion-euro sales of iPhones and other products across the EU\u2019s single market. It booked the profits in Ireland rather than the country in which the product was sold.",

      "bodyText": "If you\u2019re a bank with a stock market value of \u20ac18bn (\u00a315.4bn), a potential $14bn (\u00a310.5bn) penalty is deadly serious. But Deutsche Bank\u2019s battle with the US Department of Justice could have wider implications. It is only three months since the International Monetary Fund said that Deutsche \u201c\u2018appears to be the most important net contributor to systemic risks\u201d. Translation: the bank is so big that it could become a danger to others, not just itself. For the moment, there is no reason to panic. First, Deutsche is probably right to think that it won\u2019t end up paying the full $14bn. It is normal for the DoJ\u2019s claims to shrink as the two sides get into the argy-bargy of the settlement process. Second, the DoJ\u2019s claim has not arrived out the blue. Deutsche has known for years that this day was coming because it is one of several banks \u2013 including our own Royal Bank of Scotland \u2013 still on the hook for allegedly mis-selling US mortgage-backed securities in the run-up to the banking crash. Deutsche\u2019s pot of provisions to settle legal claims runs to \u20ac5.5bn, although the trouble with the DoJ is one of several legal scraps. Third, regulators\u2019 post-crisis reforms are designed to deal with crises at individual banks, not prevent them altogether.

But Deutsche Bank\u2019s battle with the US Department of Justice could have wider implications. It is only three months since the International Monetary Fund said that Deutsche \u201c\u2018appears to be the most important net contributor to systemic risks\u201d. Translation: the bank is so big that it could become a danger to others, not just itself.</p> <p>For the moment, there is no reason to panic. First, Deutsche is probably right to think that it won\u2019t end up paying the full $14bn. It is normal for the DoJ\u2019s claims to shrink as the two sides get into the argy-bargy of the settlement process.</p> <p>Second, the DoJ\u2019s claim has not arrived out the blue. Deutsche has known for years that this day was coming because it is one of several banks \u2013 including our own Royal Bank of Scotland \u2013 still on the hook for allegedly mis-selling US mortgage-backed securities in the run-up to the banking crash. Deutsche\u2019s pot of provisions to settle legal claims runs to \u20ac5.5bn, although the trouble with the DoJ is one of several legal scraps. </p> <p>Third, regulators\u2019 post-crisis reforms are designed to deal with crises at individual banks, not prevent them altogether.

      "bodyText": "Corporate, fun, day: three words to strike dread into the soul of antisocial workers the world over. Is there anything worse for the introvert than being forced to take part in trust exercises with colleagues you avoid at the water cooler, let alone the go-kart track or paintballing experience? Well, yes, there probably is: a corporate fun day at a trampolining centre. More and more employees are being forced to suffer the indignity of bouncing around with their co-workers at these centres, which are spreading across the country like a particularly virulent eurodisco earworm. Just over a year ago the UK boasted four indoor trampoline parks. Usually converted warehouses on out-of-town industrial estates, they are kitted out with dozens of interconnected trampolines on the floors and walls, as well as bouncing dodgeball and volleyball courts, parcour/freerunning arenas and specialist hoists to learn jumps and tricks. Though popular with children and teenagers, they are increasingly beloved of adults \u2013 and human resources departments of companies looking for ever more novel ways to bring their teams together. The first in Britain, Bounce, in Milton Keynes, opened in May 2014. Now there are 96, with a further 20 under construction. That\u2019s according to David Stalker, chief executive of Oxygen, which has opened five parks in the UK since July last year. His sixth, a 24,000 sq ft venue in Leeds, is due to open next Friday. The first branch of Oxygen, in Acton, west London, was an \u201covernight success\u201d, said Stalker, former executive director of the Fitness Association. \u201cI\u2019ve been in business my whole life and I\u2019ve never seen anything like it. It was almost ridiculous.\u201d The centre was profitable from day one and had recouped all its start-up costs by the end of the first year, he said. Michael Harrison, who set up Gravity Trampoline Parks with his friend Harvey Jenkinson, said opening the first park was \u201cliterally like striking gold, to be honest\u201d. The firm has four now, with two scheduled to open in Scotland in November and plans for between six to 10 more. \u201cWe have around 10,000 people a week bouncing at our parks,\u201d he claimed. With an hour\u2019s jumping costing upwards of \u00a38.95, and a license allowing the firm to sell drinks as well as food, it is easy to see how the takings add up. Starting a trampoline park takes a certain amount of risk, however. Harrison puts the set-up costs at between \u00a31.2m and \u00a34m, and said that the clamour to open parks was causing problems for some firms. \u201cPeople are offering crazy rents to gazump other operators,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of the issues around opening a park is getting a time to get fitted out. One supplier I know of has a waiting list of a year for equipment.\u201d In Chester, two 50,000 sq ft parks have been given permission to open next door to each other, while Hull already boasts three parks. \u201cWe are going to see one or two drop out of the market because of crazy decisions,\u201d Harrison predicted. As so often with inventions that seem initially ludicrous but eventually become part of our national fabric (see also: dental floss, the Frappuccino, spinning), trampoline parks originated in the US. The first was opened in Las Vegas in 2004 by a firm called Sky Zone, which now turns over around $240m (\u00a3183m) a year. It was watching an episode of Keeping Up With the Kardashians that one of Oxygen\u2019s directors started to think about importing the idea to the UK. \u201cHe refuses to admit it, but he was,\u201d said Stalker. \u201cThe Kardashians went trampolining and it gave him an idea. I then went out to the States and toured a few places and thought it would work over here. It appealed to me largely with my health and fitness hat on. I was keen to find something to address the UK\u2019s obesity epidemic and I knew that most people wanted to exercise more as long as they don\u2019t actually feel like they are exercising.\u201d Oxygen\u2019s Greater Manchester branch opened in June near the Trafford Centre. It was heaving over the summer holidays, as children jostled for space on the trampolines with corporate groups from firms such as Lego, Travelodge and Chill Factore, an indoor ski slope opposite. On Friday, all was quiet, barring a group of boisterous personal trainers from David Lloyd Leisure, who were in on a team-building afternoon. After a meeting in one of the party rooms, the group were issued with special non-slip yellow socks (\u00a32) and then set about bounding over the many trampolines underneath the corrugated roof. Chellee McGrath, a newly qualified trainer, looked reticent. \u201cI\u2019ve never done trampolining. I was a bit wary at first, a little bit scared,\u201d she said, before a colleague tried and failed to convince her to do a forward flip into a pool filled with chunks of protective foam. Once an hour the tannoy plays either Saturday Night by Whigfield, The Ketchup Song or the Macarena, prompting staff to bounce around as they do the actions. No one is allowed to jump until they\u2019ve sat through a video safety briefing. \u201cThere is the potential for things to go really, really wrong here. Obviously it\u2019s a high-risk activity,\u201d said manager Nick Aveyard. Oxygen has an accident rate of 0.12 he said \u2013 so just more than one in 100 customers hurt themselves, compared with 0.25 across the industry as a whole, he claimed. It is usually the adults who come a cropper, said Aveyard. \u201cMostly sprains and strains when they overcook it\u201d, but also the occasional broken tooth when a jumper forgets that the body contracts like a concertina when jumping and their knees end up hitting their jaws. Trampolining is particularly unkind to those with pelvic floor issues: Kate Winslet has said she no longer dared jump on them because of a weak bladder. Research carried out by the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents before the latest trampolining craze took off showed there were more than 13,000 trampoline injuries a year, and almost three-quarters had happened at home. Brendan Casey, a business analyst from Manchester, remembers a corporate fun day a few years ago organised by Bupa Hospitals, when a colleague from operations, Dave, ended up needing his own operation. He\u2019d had \u201ca few Budweisers\u201d before launching himself on a trampoline and ended up with his very broken arm between the frame and the padding, recalled Casey: \u201cHis cries scared birds from the trees.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Unilever is attempting to buy Hollywood actor Jessica Alba\u2019s household goods company Honest for more than $1bn (\u00a3760m), according to reports. The London-listed Unilever, which owns Dove soap, Lynx body sprays and Ben &amp; Jerry\u2019s ice cream, is on an acquisition spree buying up new and innovative companies that appeal to younger people to help maintain its stronghold on the global consumer goods market. The planned-purchase of Honest, which the Golden Globe-nominated actorco-founded in 2011, comes hot on the heels of Unilever\u2019s $1bn purchase of Dollar Shave Club. Both Unilever and Honest declined to comment on the proposed sale, which was first reported by the Wall Street Journal. Honest, which has built up a loyal customer base of young mothers who buy its diapers (nappies), household cleaners and beauty products via online subscription, is also exploring the possibility of floating on the stock market. The speculated $1bn sale price is significantly lower than the $1.7bn Honest was reportedly valued at in its most recent fundraising drive last year. Honest is attractive to Unilever for its \u201cnatural\u201d and \u201cgreen\u201d household cleaning goods, which are a booming market in the US and overseas.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Shares in Deutsche Bank, Germany\u2019s largest bank, took a dive after news that the institution faces a $14bn (\u00a310.5bn) charge over mis-selling mortgage securities in the US. Here are some of the questions raised by the bank\u2019s latest spat with regulators. Why is Deutsche Bank in trouble? The prospect of a $14bn penalty from the US Department of Justice has rattled investor confidence in Deutsche. Sentiment was already weak following a turbulent start to the year when prospects of a slowdown in global growth and lower interest rates raised questions about the bank\u2019s future profits and dented the share price. The penalty aims to settle allegations, dating back to 2005, about the way the bank selected mortgages, packaged them into bonds and sold on to investors. These bonds are known as residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS). Can Deutsche afford the bill? Deutsche Bank has been quick to describe the fine as an \u201copening position\u201d from Washington. It is easy to see why. It would be one of the largest ever fines levied by the US. It could also strain the bank\u2019s finances. For 2015, the bank reported its first annual loss since 2008 and could be heading for another loss this year regardless of the threatened justice department fine. According to Tomas Kinmonth, an analyst at Dutch bank ABN Amro, a settlement on that scale could impede Deutsche\u2019s ability to pay coupons \u2013 or regular interest payments to investors \u2013 on a special type of bond. \u201cNot only are clouds over their profitability still above them, but the fine announcement will come as very unwanted news indeed,\u201d said Kinmonth. The bonds are known as AT1s, which are intended to shore up Deutsche in a time of crisis. The bank, though, has made clear it has no intention of agreeing to a fine at this level and has stressed it has the resources to keep making payments on the bonds until 2017, at least. However, one analyst told Reuters that any fine topping \u20ac5bn would force it to raise fresh funds in the financial markets by tapping shareholders for cash. Is this the end of Deutsche Bank\u2019s regulator troubles? The bank has set aside \u20ac5.5bn for litigation costs but does not spell out exactly what that sum is for. It is battling more than 7,000 legal cases, although the ones gaining most attention are the RMBS case and one relating to activities in Russia, where the bank is facing an investigation into so-called mirror trades, where clients bought shares in Russia and simultaneously sold similar shares abroad in foreign currency. Regulators are investigating whether or not these trades skirted international sanctions against Russia by turning Russia-held roubles into dollars held outside the country. Why have shares in RBS taken a dive as well? For at least a year, the bailed-out UK bank has been warning the City it faces a penalty over RMBS. Only on Monday, finance director Ewen Stevenson told investors that its $5.6bn provision for various claims relating to these mortgage bonds might not be enough. \u201cThis provision does not include or reflect potential penalties and compensatory damages that may be imposed by US DoJ, which may be substantial,\u201d Stevenson said. The potential scale of the penalty facing Deutsche has raised anxiety about the possible fine facing RBS, which is 73% owned by taxpayers and yet to make an annual profit since its bailout in 2008. Could other European banks be affected? Deutsche is the first European bank that appears to have started talks with the DoJ over RMBS. Barclays and the Swiss bank UBS are among others waiting for settlement talks to be concluded. Their shares also fell on Friday.",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s top financial regulator has launched a staunch defence of pension saving as a key part of preparing for old age, countering comments by the Bank of England\u2019s chief economist that the best bet for a comfortable retirement is to invest in property. Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority, said workers should avoid putting all their eggs in one basket and should not rely on property to fund their retirement. In his first speech since joining the regulator in July, he said the risks of relying on property were too great and savers should have a balanced portfolio of investments. In a thinly veiled attacked on Andy Haldane, chief economist at the Bank of England, Bailey said public officials should provide a clearer picture of the risks of investing in property compared with a pension. The current poor returns on pension saving could improve over the period of a working life, he said. Equally, returns on property investments could stall or decline over time. Haldane drew protests from the pensions industry when he said property was a better bet for retirement planning than a pension. \u201cIt ought to be pension but it\u2019s almost certainly property,\u201d he said. \u201cAs long as we continue not to build anything like as many houses in this country as we need to \u2026 we will see what we\u2019ve had for the better part of a generation, which is house prices relentlessly heading north.\u201d Ros Altmann, the former pensions minister, criticised Haldane, saying it was \u201cirresponsible\u201d to suggest people should rely on property rather than pensions. Bailey said regulators needed to understand that it was becoming more complicated for individuals to make rational decisions when life expectancy was rising, state pension payouts being delayed, and the shift from work to retirement becoming less clear cut. He said there were huge risks for the regulator when millions of homebuyers were tempted to take on greater levels of debt to purchase a flat or house, especially when many of them were betting that rising house prices would provide long-term gains. \u201cRetirement saving and pensions is one of the largest issues we face. It needs to be considered broadly. There are some very big issues at stake here: the balance of who takes the risk, between the state, employers and individuals, with the balance shifting to individuals; the potential for large inter-generational shifts in income and wealth; and the impact of heightened economic uncertainty on the ability to write long-term financial contracts which embed assumptions on future returns,\u201d Bailey said.",

      "bodyText": "My partner, Bob Gannicott, who has died of leukaemia aged 69, was an adventurer and prospector who emigrated from the UK to Canada with \u00a3100 in his pocket but made a fortune after he was instrumental in establishing the Canadian diamond industry. Bob was born in Sandford, Somerset, the son of Ida, a teacher, and Ivor, an engineer who had served on submarines during the second world war. Bob passed the 11-plus and went from grammar school to Nottingham University to study mining engineering, but dropped out to go to Canada on a \u00a310 emigration ticket (repayable if he returned). He and I had been together since we were 15, our parents being neighbours. We were two sides of the same coin, spending most weekends caving in the Mendip hills. I agreed to join him in Canada on finishing my degree, but he lost faith that I would do so and he met and married someone else. I also married, had children and subsequently divorced. We had no contact for 30 years. By hitchhiking and riding freight trains, Bob made his way to Yellowknife, in Canada\u2019s Northwest Territories, initially to work in the area\u2019s goldmines. But he also staked some claims of his own and one of these, made when he was just 19, was 25 years later to become Canada\u2019s first diamond mine, the Diavik. He meanwhile went back to university, Carleton in Ottawa, to obtain a geology degree, and then spent many years mining in Greenland. He loved the isolation of the Arctic wilderness. Returning eventually to the Northwest Territories, he forged a partnership to search for diamonds and ultimately struck lucky on his old claim. With his growing wealth, Bob \u2013 a great visionary and strategist \u2013 saw an opportunity to change the culture of the global diamond industry. He acquired the famous but struggling American jewellery business Harry Winston, and grew the brand. In this way he \u201cbookended\u201d the industry and became ideally placed to challenge the primacy of the De Beers group. He eventually sold Harry Winston to Swatch Group in 2013. Bob had meanwhile moved his new company, Dominion Diamonds, from Toronto to Yellowknife to create employment for local indigenous people, for whose rights he had long campaigned. He had divorced and asked me for a second time to make a life with him, despite my having been diagnosed with Parkinson\u2019s disease. I stood down from my role as head of the Charity Commission and we got together, spending half the year in the Northwest Territories and half in Somerset. Canada is now the world\u2019s third largest producer of diamonds. A foundation is to be set up in Bob\u2019s name to continue his work for the indigenous people of the Northwest Territories.",

      "bodyText": "And finally.... there\u2019s no let- up on the anxiety in the banking sector this afternoon. Deutsche Bank shares are hitting new lows, down almost 9% in late trading, in its worst day since Britain voted to leave the EU. Jasper Lawler of CMC Markets explains: \u201cThe decline in DB shares was the biggest since the day after the Brexit vote. The fine would be to settle an investigation into the mis-selling of US mortgage backed securities. The $14bn would be about 80% of Deutsche Bank\u2019s market cap and may dissuade employees from following CEO John Cryan\u2019s recent advice to \u201cbe more daring.\u201d Royal Bank of Scotland has shed 5% \u2013 pushed down by fears that it could incur a whopping fine from the DoJ too (as explained this morning). Many other European banks have shed two or three percent, in a new bout of jitteriness about the banking sector. That\u2019s all for today, and indeed this week. Have a good weekend, and see you on Monday! GW Grexit is no more!! Wall Street firm Citi has told clients today that it no longer thinks Greece will leave the eurozone in the next three years. Despite the latest tensions between Athens and its creditors, they reckon its bailout programme will remain intact. Readers may remember that Citi actually dreamed up the term Grexit in 2012, when chief economist William Buiter said there was a 90% chance the country would leave the eurozone. That prediction proved incorrect; will today\u2019s recantation come back to bite them? The German newspaper Handelsblatt describes the proposed $14bn settlement as a \u201ccold shower\u201d for Deutsche Bank. \u201cSuch a large sum would amount to a minor catastrophe: if the bank had to raise the fine out of its capital, it would shrink its equity ratio to single digits, perhaps eight percent. For a bank of this calibre and complexity, this would be unacceptable and would practically force a capital increase\u201d Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s has a glimmer of good news for Deutsche Bank - it isn\u2019t planning to downgrade its credit rating, despite the threat of a $14bn settlement with the DoJ. S&amp;P currently rates Deutsche Bank as BBB+ with a negative outlook, and says this is \u201cnot immediately affected by reports that it is negotiating a settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice\u201d. S&amp;P also expects that Deutsche will end up paying more than it has currently set aside to cover litigation costs, even if it avoids the full $14bn bill. Deutsche Bank held \u20ac5.5 billion of litigation reserves on June 30, 2016, and identified a further \u20ac1.7 billion of unreserved contingent litigation liabilities. The latter are defined as obligations that can be estimated and where a loss is considered less than probable, but more than remote. Our capital and earnings forecasts anticipate the crystallization of this contingent liability, with additional charges on top. The Brexit vote is cast a shadow over London Fashion Week, where top designers fear being frozen out of the European market. Caroline Rush, chief executive of the British Fashion Council, says its \u201cvitally important\u201d that Britain maintains access to the single market. Rush says: \u201cWe need to ensure that our changing relationship with the EU will not impact on the creativity of London, our access to new talent overseas or the ongoing education and training programmes we support.\u201d The EU referendum has delivered some benefits to the industry, though - sales to tourists should rise thanks to the weak pound. The US Federal Reserve is still unlikely to raise rates at its meeting next week, despite this pickup in inflation. But FXTM research analyst Lukman Otunuga reckons the Fed could easily hike in December: Dollar bulls were offered a lifeline on Friday following the impressive US inflation data which rekindled optimism over the Federal Reserve raising US rates this year. CPI for August printed at 0.2% while Core CPI ticked higher at +0.3% simply elevating sentiment towards the US economy. With inflationary pressures building up gradually in the world\u2019s largest economy, the Fed may have been provided a compelling reason to act before year end. Although expectations have withered over September being a live meeting to pull the trigger, the hope of December being a possibility to act could keep the Dollar buoyed. The US dollar is strengthening following the rise in US inflation, as investors calculate that it makes interest rate rises a little more likely. This means the pound has now lost a whole cent, to $1.313. And the euro has lost half a cent, to $1.118. Just in: America\u2019s inflation rate has risen by more than expected, reigniting the debate on whether US interest rates should rise. Consumer prices rose by 0.2% month-on-month in August, higher than the 0.1% economists expected. That\u2019s also an increase on July, when prices were unchanged during the month. Although fuel prices fell, rents and healthcare costs pushed up the cost of living. The annual rate of inflation also picked up, giving ammunition to those who think the Federal Reserve should raise interest rates. On an annual basis, prices rose by 1.1% last month - up from 0.8% in July. And core inflation, which strips out volatile elements like fuel and food, rose to 2.3%. The German government has now weighed in over the Deutsche Bank issue, saying it expects its largest bank to be treated \u201cfairly\u201d by US authorities. Finance Ministry spokeswoman Friederike von Tiesenhausen also flagged up that the settlement process isn\u2019t over, even though the DoJ want Deutsche to pay a $14bn settlement. She told reporters that: \u201cThe government is aware that the U.S. authorities have agreed similar settlement payments with other credit institutions. The government expects that at the end of this process a fair result will be achieved on the basis of equal treatment. (thanks to Reuters for the quote) Meanwhile Deutsche executives have been trying to reassure investors that it won\u2019t be forced to raise fresh capital: While Mark Carney was being quizzed about Brexit, Scotland and Skepta, the pound was losing ground in the foreign exchange market. Sterling has lost around 0.5% this morning, to $1.317 against the US dollar. It\u2019s on track for its worst week in over a month. It\u2019s tempting to suggest that the markets have lost faith in Mark Carney\u2019s authority, now he\u2019s been outvoted over his household pet. But instead, fellow Bank policymaker Kristin Forbes has done the damage. She\u2019s told a conference in Paris that a weak pound should help fix Britain\u2019s current account deficit. Forbes said (via Reuters): \u201cSterling\u2019s depreciation should improve the UK\u2019s net foreign asset position by over 20 percent of GDP. That\u2019s a big improvement in the UK\u2019s net international asset position and that should alleviate concerns by international investors about the UK\u2019s ability to pay on its net foreign asset position.\u201d Newsflash from Moscow: Russia\u2019s central bank has cut interest rates in an attempt to stimulate its economy. Borrowing costs have been slashed from 10.5% to 10%, with the central bank citing \u201cthe inflation slowdown...decrease in inflation expectations and unstable economic activity.\u201d It\u2019s the second Russia rate cut this year, as the central bank tries to nurse the economy back to health without weakening the rouble. Mark \u2018Carnage\u2019 Carney\u2019s grilling at Whitley Academy in Coventry concludes with a few quick-fire questions. Q: What\u2019s your dream job? Ice-hockey goalie in the NHL. Q: What TV programme is your guilty pleasure? Bake-Off (Bet he\u2019s cross about Mel and Sue leaving) Q: Most expensive luxury you\u2019ve ever bought? Carney can\u2019t think of one. Q: What\u2019s your favourite film? Gallipoli. Q: Favourite food? Pizza. Q: How much money do you have on you right now? I\u2019ve got a new five pound note, says the Governor proudly, plus \u00a340 in my bag. Q: Spender or saver? At the moment, Saver, says Carney, after a nanosecond\u2019s pause Q: Cats or dogs? Dogs, but I have a cat  . It\u2019s because I\u2019m outvoted in the household, Carney explains. Q: Football or ice hockey? Football - because it\u2019s important to understand the personalities in sport. And finally, a popular music question: Q: Skepta or Craig David? The governor looks baffled. Classic stuff. You can watch a replay here (scroll back to 10.18am) Another ace question for Mark Carney, from schoolboy Jay: Q: Who is easier to work with, David Cameron or Theresa May? Carney diplomatically ducks this poser, though, saying: They\u2019ve both very professional, very easy to work with, and focused on making the country better. Q: Could Scotland still use the pound if it becomes independent? Carney says there would need to be some fiscal sharing between governments. You can\u2019t be fully independent and have a stable currency union. The children in Coventry are asking Mark Carney some excellent questions, with many focusing on the EU referendum. Carney says his toughest day on the job was the night of the Brexit vote, and the morning afterwards. Q: How did you become aware of the Brexit result, and what was your first thought? Carney says he had a two-hour nap, and then activated the Bank\u2019s Brexit plan once the results showed that the Leave campaign had won. Carney says: My reaction was to make sure that the big fat plan that we had in place was being activated - and that everyone was doing what they should do. He also gave more thought to what he\u2019d say to the nation at 8am. Q: Which countries outside the EU will be Britain\u2019s best trade allies after Brexit? Carney says he\u2019s confident that many countries will want to have deeper trade relationships with the UK, which has a lot of strong exporters. Pressed on which country would be best - he plumps for Canada, his homeland. Carney is then asked, by Caitlin, what advice he\u2019d give his younger self. And the governor says he should have shown better financial discipline in his youth - saving more money and investing it in equity funds (not just into a savings account). He says he didn\u2019t always shop around for the best deals on mortgages and loan. A classic moment, as Mark Carney reveals that one of his childhood nicknames was \u201ccarnage\u201d. That\u2019ll be handy, the next time we have heavy losses in the financial markets. Q: What\u2019s the best and worst part of your job? Carney says the best part is events like today\u2019s - meeting schools and businesses around the country. The overseas travel is the toughest part -- he spends one in three weekends away at international events. But no-one should feel sorry for him, he adds. Q: If you could spend all the UK\u2019s money on anything, what would you buy? Carney says he\u2019d buy a few things (launching a little lecture into the \u2018diminishing marginal utility\u2019 law). He picks lot of Dairy Milk chocolate, football tickets to Everton, and lots of music, old records. From the audience, Amy says it\u2019s a \u2018very good decision\u2019. Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, is facing a grilling from schoolchildren in Coventry now. He\u2019s tried to butter them up, by promising a new plastic \u00a35 to anyone who asks a nice question. But his audience won\u2019t be bought off easily. Spencer asks the governor to account for his ultraloose monetary policy, asking: Q: Why should we save money in a bank when interest rate are so low? Carney explains that people put money aside for a \u2018big purchase\u2019, such as a Wii console or a bike. Banks are a secure place to place money. And the Bank is also trying to give people incentives to spend, or invest in riskier assets. It\u2019s live on BBC News now.... Financial commentator Frances Coppola reckons that the DoJ may be unwilling to lower Deutsche Bank\u2019s proposed $14bn settlement, based on recent history. She reminds us that Bank of America has to pay $16.6bn in August 2014, to settle its own history of packaging up toxic loans and selling them onto investors. Banking analyst Tomas Kinmonth of ABN Amro is concerned that Deutsche Bank could end up defaulting on certain bonds. Those \u2018convertible capital\u2019, or CoCo, bonds, are designed as a safety net for banks - and will convert into equity if a bank cannot pay the interest (or coupon) on the debt. They\u2019re also known as additional tier 1 capital (AT1 bonds). According to Kinmonth, Deutche is close to the \u2018trigger point\u2019 on its AT1s, when it doesn\u2019t have enough capital to repay investors. A big fine could push it over the line. He says: Not only are clouds over their profitability still above them, but the fine announcement will come as very unwanted news indeed. Financial statements show that Deutsche Bank has a distance to the MDA trigger at the end of Q2 was 1.40%, which equates to \u20ac5.65bn. These values indicate that DB AT1 coupon payments could be at real risk, if the fine is over \u20ac11bn. This is because the company has provisions set aside for litigation costs at \u20ac5.5bn. However, the ADI values will be a focus now for the bank. DB reported for 2016 an AT1 payment capacity of \u20ac1.1bn for the year. This was sufficient to pay the \u20ac350mn of AT1 coupons on 30 April 2016, however the capacity for DB to make payments can come under threat from this fine. The FT reports that Deutsche Bank\u2019s CoCo bonds are falling in value this morning, suggesting the City believes they are riskier. Hat-tip to the Wall Street Journal for breaking the Deutsche Bank story last night: They wrote: The U.S. Justice Department proposed that Deutsche Bank AG pay $14 billion to settle a set of high-profile mortgage-securities probes stemming from the financial crisis, according to people familiar with the matter, a number that would rank among the largest of what other banks have paid to resolve similar claims and is well above what investors have been expecting. The figure is described by people close to the negotiations between Deutsche Bank and the government as preliminary, and they said it came up in discussions between the bank and government lawyers in recent days. It hasn\u2019t been previously disclosed. Deutsche Bank is expected to push back strongly against it, the people said, and it is far from clear what the final outcome will be. Neil Wilson, markets analyst at ETX Capital, is also concerned that Royal Bank of Scotland could face a stinging fine from the US authorities: RBS could have to pay up to $13bn to settle the claims. Even a third of this figure which deliver a crippling blow to the lender, making its return to profitability even further off. It would also derail plans to return the bank to private ownership any time soon. After its latest loss, RBS has notched up \u00a350bn in losses since the financial crisis \u2013 more than the \u00a345bn stumped up by taxpayers to save the bank. The cost of insuring against Deutsche Bank defaulting on its bonds has risen this morning, as investors fret about its ability to pay billions to the DoJ: Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Market, says the size of Deutsche\u2019s fine has shocked investors, sparking today\u2019s rout. This claim has not appeared out of blue, it was expected, but the number is nearly four-fold higher what analysts were anticipating and this is putting the company\u2019s share under immense pressure. He also fears that US authorities could come down hard on other banks: But our concern is that this could be just a start and other European banks could face a similar fate and this why investors are leaving the boat with respect to the banking sector. If the Department of Justice will negotiate the number, that is a different question, because both Bank of America and Goldman Sachs have paid very hefty fines. Almost $1.5bn has been knocked off Deutsche Bank\u2019s market capitalisation (or value) this morning. That means the bank is only valued at below $19bn, worryingly close to the $14bn which the DoJ wants to fine it. That may actually strengthen Deutsche\u2019s hand as it tried to negotiate a smaller penalty from the US authorities. Dominic Elliott of Reuters reckons Deutsche could only manage a $7.5bn bill. It\u2019s turning into a bad morning for the banks.... Royal Bank of Scotland has been caught up the prospects of a hefty fine on Deutsche Bank for mis-selling mortgage bonds in the run up to the banking crisis. Its shares have fallen almost 4% to 187p, well below the 502p at which taxpayers break even on the stake they acquired bailing RBS out in 2008. The 73% taxpayer owned bank has been warning for two years that it faces penalties over so-called RMBS - residential mortgage backed securities - and only this week its finance director Ewen Stevenson was telling analysts that it might well need to take extra provisions. Analysts estimates for scale of the charges range from \u00a34bn to \u00a39bn. While RBS had hoped to have agreed a deal with the US authorities last year, talks are not now expected until 2017. So far RBS has taken a $5.6bn provision to deal with RMBS but the bulk of this is to deal with the FHFA regulator and the not the department of justice which has now turned its sights on Deutsche, The timing of the Deutsche Bank fine is fascinating. For a start, it mark the eight anniversary of Lehman Brothers\u2019 collapse - the iconic symbol of the financial crisis. It also follows the huge tax bill which the EU slapped on Apple in August, enraging the US establishment. As the Financial Times puts it: Coming only days after the EU stirred up angry reactions from US politicians by ordering Apple to pay \u20ac13bn of back taxes in Ireland, there is a strong suspicion in financial circles that Deutsche could be the victim of the US taking revenge on Europe. Banking shares across Europe are being thumped, as investors are spooked by Deutsche Bank\u2019s $14bn fine. Deutsche Bank are leading the rout, slumping by 8% to \u20ac12.06 as a wave of selling grips the Frankfurt exchange. But the damage doesn\u2019t stop there. The news that the DoJ is taking such a hard line with Deutsche has hit the whole sector. In London, Royal Bank of Scotland has shed almost 4%, making it the worst-performing member of the FTSE 100. RBS is currently being investigated by the DoJ over its mortgage-backed securities business - the same area that got Deutsche into such trouble.... Standard Chartered, Barclays and Lloyds are also suffering.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Shakespeare once reminded us that: When sorrows come, they come not single spies, but in battalions. And the Bard of Avon would have made a decent banking analyst. Because Deutsche Bank is facing another serious problem today \u2013 a massive $14bn fine for mis-selling mortgage-backed financial products in the US in the run-up to the 2008 crisis. Shares in Deutche Bank have plunged by 8% in early trading in Frankfurt, after it emerged overnight that the Department of Justice wants to impose the $14bn penalty. This would be one of the biggest fines ever levied on a bank, exceed the $13bn which JP Morgan paid in 2013 to settle allegations that it misled investors. Deutsche is fighting back, saying this morning that it hopes to haggle the DoJ down. In a statement, the bank declared: \u201cDeutsche Bank has no intent to settle these potential civil claims anywhere near the number cited.\u201d \u201cThe negotiations are only just beginning. The bank expects that they will lead to an outcome similar to those of peer banks which have settled at materially lower amounts.\u201d Deutsche Bank already had enough headaches. Record low eurozone interest rates are eating into its profitability, some analysts think it needs more capital, and any Brexit-related downturn could trigger more bad debts. Also coming up today... It\u2019s a quietish Friday, but we do get the latest US inflation figures at 1.30pm BST. That could shed new light on whether America\u2019s central bank might raise interest rates soon (just as the Bank of England moves towards cutting borrowing costs to fresh record lows). Britain\u2019s MPs are expected to launch a new crackdown on bosses pay: And a major row is brewing in Greece. Last night, investigators raided the home of the country\u2019s central bank governor, Yannis Stournaras, and his wife\u2019s company, in a corruption probe. Coincidentally (or perhaps not?), the Bank of Greece has just rejected the government\u2019s proposed candidates to run Attica Bank, a state-backed lender. We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day...",

A big fine could push it over the line.</p> <p>He says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Not only are clouds over their profitability still above them, but the fine announcement will come as very unwanted news indeed.

This is because the company has provisions set aside for litigation costs at \u20ac5.5bn. However, the ADI values will be a focus now for the bank.

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s boardroom bosses have been warned they face a clampdown on bonuses and scrutiny over their pay, in the latest sign that Theresa May\u2019s promise to reduce corporate excess is being heeded by City fund mangers. The warning was issued by Legal &amp; General Investment Management, which has called for companies to publish the ratio between the chief executive\u2019s pay and that of the median employee in a letter to major firms to warn them of its new approach to boardroom pay. LGIM, the fund management arm of insurer Legal &amp; General, has told firms there should be a cap on directors\u2019 bonuses, so that they are not bigger than two times salary. The fund manager, which has stakes in most companies in the FTSE 350, has written to them with its views on executive pay just as the prime minister raised the prospect of putting employees on company boards, and making shareholder votes on executive pay legally binding. L&amp;G\u2019s intervention also comes as MPs prepare to increase their scrutiny of corporate behaviour by launching an inquiry into boardroom pay and structure. The Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) select committee, chaired by MP Iain Wright, will build on its work into the collapse of BHS and the working conditions at retailer Sports Direct with wider scrutiny of corporate Britain. Announcing the inquiry on Friday, Wright said: \u201cIrresponsible business behaviour and poor corporate governance certainly act against the interests of workers, but they also act as a brake on long-term prosperity and profitability in companies. We need to look again at the laws that govern business and how they are enforced.\u201d Even before the vote for Brexit, which led to May becoming prime minister, there had been a series of revolts over executive pay. When the annual general meeting season started in April, shareholders voted down pay deals at BP and medical equipment group Smith &amp; Nephew. Other revolts followed. The BIS committee intends to look at whether this is evidence that shareholders have all the tools they need to rein in pay. \u201cWhile there has been some recent shareholder actions against these ever larger pay packages, can we have any confidence that the current framework for controlling pay is working? As a committee, we will want to look at whether executive pay should take account of companies\u2019 long-term performance and whether the government should intervene further to control executive pay,\u201d said Wright. LGIM is largely building upon the recommendations of a working group, which published its findings in July and in which L&amp;G chief executive Nigel Wilson played a key role. That group rejected May\u2019s ideas for a binding vote on pay deals and did not set out how much directors should be paid. LGIM does not set a level of pay either but told companies: \u201cWe would encourage the reduction of short-term annual bonus levels. Two hundred percent of salary should be reserved for the largest global companies.\u201d Annual bonuses are only part of directors\u2019 pay as many also also receive long-term incentive (LTIPs) awards in the form of shares over three- or five-year periods. The working group in July set out an idea to use restricted shares instead of LTIPs and other bonuses. LGIM gives this a cautious reception and when these are used they should be fewer of them than through traditional LTIPs. \u201cAward levels should be reduced by 50% or more of the normal long term incentive grant to take in to account certainty,\u201d LGIM said. Sarah Wilson, chief executive of shareholder advisory body Manifest, said LGIM was addressing how much the chief executive is paid relative to the rest of the executive directors. Not all investors endorse the idea of pay ratios. Referring to the BIS committee investigation, Mike Fox, head of sustainable investments at Royal London Asset Management, said: \u201cWhile we support the investigation we are concerned it could lead to support for a \u2018pay ratio\u2019 which we believe is a crude measure that risks tarring well governed firms with the same brush as those with a flagrant disregard for what is acceptable.\u201d Data published by the High Pay Centre and Manifest last year showed that the ratio of chief executive pay in the FTSE 100 to their average employee was 150:1 in 2014. The High Pay Centre is setting up a \u201c40 times\u201d club, referring to a specific ratio of executive pay to the wider workforce, of which only a handful of FTSE 100 companies would be members.",

LGIM gives this a cautious reception and when these are used they should be fewer of them than through traditional LTIPs. \u201cAward levels should be reduced by 50% or more of the normal long term incentive grant to take in to account certainty,\u201d LGIM said.</p> <p>Sarah Wilson, chief executive of shareholder advisory body Manifest, said LGIM was addressing how much the chief executive is paid relative to the rest of the executive directors.</p> <p>Not all investors endorse the idea of pay ratios. Referring to the BIS committee investigation, Mike Fox, head of sustainable investments at Royal London Asset Management, said: \u201cWhile we support the investigation we are concerned it could lead to support for a \u2018pay ratio\u2019 which we believe is a crude measure that risks tarring well governed firms with the same brush as those with a flagrant disregard for what is acceptable.\u201d</p> <p>Data published by the High Pay Centre and Manifest last year showed that the ratio of chief executive pay in the FTSE 100 to their average employee was 150:1 in 2014. The High Pay Centre is setting up a \u201c40 times\u201d club, referring to a specific ratio of executive pay to the wider workforce, of which only a handful of FTSE 100 companies would be members. </p>",

So revealed Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England as he fielded questions from school children in a lively exchange in Coventry. Giving a rare insight into the man behind the title, Carney was forced out of his comfort zone by the live BBC School Report (starts at 1 hr 18 mins) audience, who tackled him on subjects ranging from Brexit to pets. At times the young crowd would have been forgiven for thinking they were in an inflation report press conference, as Carney gave his trademark technical answers to some questions. \u201cDiminishing market utility\u201d was given a run-out at one point, as part of an answer to a question on what he would spend all the UK\u2019s money on, if he could (asked to narrow it down to three things, he plumped for Dairy Milk chocolate, tickets to watch Everton football club and lots of old music records). There were plenty of these lighter moments. Showing off the new plastic \u00a35 note, released this week, he quipped that anyone who asked him a nice question could keep one. But the children kept the usually guarded Carney on his toes, sprinkling light-hearted questions among more serious ones. Asked why anyone should keep money in a bank when interest rates were so low, he responded that they are a secure place to keep money and a good place to save for a \u201cbig purchase\u201d, such as a Wii console or a bike (nice nod to his audience demographic, there). The governor looked slightly bewildered when asked by one audience member what nicknames he was given as a child. \u201cI was given nicknames that were variants of my last name which is Carney, so I was called Carnival, or Carnage, or things like that. I like Carnage a little better than Carnival. It seemed a little more manly I guess.\u201d Asked who was easier to work with, David Cameron or Theresa May, he replied diplomatically. \u201cThey are both very professional, incredibly easy to work with. Both focused on making the country better.\u201d He was similarly diplomatic when asked whether he preferred cats or dogs, giving his best one-liner: \u201cDogs, but I\u2019ve got a cat ... It\u2019s because I\u2019m outvoted in the household.\u201d In more serious moments Carney revealed that the night of the EU referendum and the following day was the most difficult period in the job so far. Following a two-hour nap until half past midnight on 24 June, he watched the votes come in and arrived at his office in Threadneedle Street at about 3.30am. \u201cThe reason it was a tough day was not because of the result, but because in order to put our plans in place, we had to have a huge number of people co-ordinate with people here in the UK and people who do my type of job around the world, and ensure that everyone did the right thing at the right time, so that nobody noticed any ripples as a result of it.\u201d He said there would be plenty of opportunity for Britain to develop deeper trade ties with countries such as Canada and Australia and with emerging markets in the post Brexit world, because of \u201cwhat the UK has to offer. It is truly innovative.\u201d In a quick-fire question and answer session to round off the event, he said his dream job would be ice hockey goalie in the NHL (National Hockey League); his guilty pleasure TV show is The Great British Bake Off; and he was carrying \u00a340 in cash. But Mark \u201cCarnage\u201d Carney was the best moment of all, and the one that is likely to stick.",

    "webTitle": "Deutsche Bank to fight Department of Justice's $14bn fine", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Deutsche Bank has vowed to challenge a $14bn claim by the US Department of Justice to settle an investigation into its selling of mortgage-backed securities. The claim against Deutsche, which the bank said it would dispute strongly, far outstrips the bank\u2019s and investors\u2019 expectations for such costs. While it not clear what the final payment will be, a fine as high as $14bn would be a severe strain for Deutsche\u2019s fragile finances and would likely further rock investor confidence in the bank. The bank\u2019s shares fell sharply on Friday morning. \u201cDeutsche Bank has no intent to settle these potential civil claims anywhere near the number cited. The negotiations are only just beginning. The bank expects that they will lead to an outcome similar to those of peer banks which have settled at materially lower amounts,\u201d Deutsche Bank said in a statement on Friday. It gave no details about the alleged mis-selling but a source close to the matter told Agence France-Presse that the allegations stemmed from the sale of mortgage securities in the 2008 crisis. The Department of Justice, which declined to comment on Friday, has taken a tough stance in settlement negotiations with other banks, requesting sums higher than the eventual fine. In 2014, it asked Citigroup to pay $12bn to resolve an investigation into the sale of shoddy mortgage-backed securities, sources said. The fine eventually came in at $7bn. In a similar case, rival Goldman Sachs agreed in April to pay $5.06 billion to settle claims that it misled mortgage bond investors during the financial crisis. That settlement included a $2.39bn civil penalty, $1.8bn in other relief, including funds for homeowners whose mortgages exceed the value of their property, and an $875m payment to resolve claims by cooperative and home loan banks among others. Deutsche Bank\u2019s settlement will comprise a different list of recipients, a source close to the matter said, adding that the lender had already settled some claims three years ago. In late 2013, Deutsche Bank agreed to pay $1.9bn to settle claims that it defrauded US government-controlled Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, America\u2019s biggest providers of housing finance, into buying $14.2bn in mortgage-backed securities before the 2008 financial crisis. A $14bn fine, or even half that sum, would still rank among one of the largest paid by banks to US authorities in recent years. In 2013, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co agreed to pay $13bn to settle allegations by the U.S. authorities that it overstated the quality of mortgages it was selling to investors in the run-up to the 2008-2009 financial crisis. In 2014, Bank of America agreed to pay $16.7bn in penalties to settle similar charges. Deutsche Bank has not said what it has set aside in anticipation of a settlement over the sale and packaging of resident mortgage-backed securities before 2008. Its overall legal provisions stood at \u20ac5.5bn at the end of the second quarter. Deutsche was once one of Europe\u2019s most successful players on Wall Street. Like many of its peers, it has since faced a slew of lawsuits that often trace back to the boom years before the crash. Its litigation bill since 2012 has already hit more than \u20ac12bn. Claims filed by individuals, companies and regulators against Deutsche, outlined in the bank\u2019s 2015 annual report, relate to mis-selling of subprime loans and manipulation of foreign exchange rates or gold and silver prices. Other lawsuits are for the rigging of borrowing benchmarks Libor and Euribor, used to set the price of mortgages and derivatives. In July, chief executive John Cryan said he hoped to close the four largest remaining litigation cases this year. These are the mortgages and FX cases, an investigation into suspicious equities trades in Russia and allegations of money laundering. Reuters and AFP contributed to this report. \u2022 This article was amended on 16 September 2016. An earlier version said incorrectly in the headline and first paragraph that Deutsche Bank \u201cmust pay $14bn\u201d to settle the claim. As stated elsewhere in the article, Deutsche disputes the claim and it is not clear what the final figure will be.",

      "bodyText": "Theresa May\u2019s clampdown on corporate excess is to be taken up by a powerful committee of MPs in a public inquiry into spiralling executive pay and the composition of boardrooms. The Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) select committee, chaired by MP Iain Wright, will build on its work into the collapse of BHS and the working conditions at retailer Sports Direct with wider scrutiny of corporate Britain. Announcing the inquiry, Wright said: \u201cIrresponsible business behaviour and poor corporate governance certainly act against the interests of workers, but they also act as a brake on long-term prosperity and profitability in companies. We need to look again at the laws that govern business and how they are enforced. \u201cWe are also keen to explore the issue of ever growing pay increases to executives, especially when there often seems to be very little connection with company performance or any pay rises to the vast majority of employees.\u201d The wide-ranging investigation will also consider the possibility of worker representation on company boards and remuneration committees, as well as the barriers to women rising to the top levels of management. Boardroom excess and corporate governance were themes raised by May in her bid for the Conservative leadership after the EU referendum and one that she is expected to continue in her role as prime minister. May had outlined her agenda for corporate Britain in July just minutes before her rival, Andrea Leadsom, pulled out of the leadership contest. She pushed for shareholder votes on corporate pay to be not just advisory but binding, and she raised the idea of consumers and workers being represented on company boards. The BIS committee will take evidence from shareholders, employers\u2019 bodies and campaigners for boardroom change. MPs will consider whether the long-term performance of companies should be taken into account when executive pay deals are reached, and whether or not recent shareholder revolts suggest investors need a greater role. Frances O\u2019Grady, general secretary of the TUC, said: \u201cPoor corporate governance contributes not only to high profile corporate disasters such as BHS, but also to short-termism and excessive executive pay across much of the private sector. This inquiry is important and timely and the TUC welcomes the opportunity to contribute to the committee\u2019s discussions.\u201d The BIS committee has conducted a number of high-profile investigations in recent months, including a 60-page report into the collapse of retailer BHS \u2013 along with the work and pensions committee \u2013 and a 33-page report into working conditions at Sports Direct. The deadline for submitting written evidence for the inquiry on pay and corporate governance is 26 October. Simon Walker, director general of the Institute of Directors, said: \u201cThe reputation of corporate Britain has not recovered from the financial crisis, and there are important questions that need to be addressed on issues including transparency, executive pay and board diversity. The prime minister has made clear that company boards are in her sights, so directors must fully engage in this debate.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Fears that Deutsche Bank could face a $14bn (\u00a310.5bn) penalty from the US authorities for mis-selling bonds in the run-up to the financial crisis prompted an 8% plunge in its shares and raised fears about the potential bills for rival lenders involved in similar investigations. Even as Deutsche insisted it had no intention of agreeing to such a settlement with the Department of Justice, questions were raised about the possible impact on Germany\u2019s lender from activities which allegedly took place a decade ago. Berlin called for its biggest bank \u2013 run by Briton John Cryan \u2013 to be treated fairly. Deutsche\u2019s plight led to a sell-off in shares on Friday in other banks facing potential penalties from the DoJ, including Royal Bank of Scotland, which fell more than 4% \u2013 the biggest faller in the FTSE 100. The focus also turned on Barclays as well as major Swiss banks. The DoJ action comes almost eight years to the day that Lehman Brothers collapsed, catapulting the global economy into a deep and prolonged crisis, and demonstrated that the clean-up of the financial sector is still ongoing. The matter relates to the way banks packaged up mortgage bonds before the crisis \u2013 between 2005 and 2007 \u2013 and sold these so-called residential mortgage backed securities (RMBS) to investors, who later suffered losses. It would be one of the largest penalties levied on a bank, but Deutsche insisted it did not expect the $14bn to be the final figure. Jasper Lawler of CMC Markets said that the mooted penalty represented around 80% of the stock market value of Deutsche, which has been already been pummelled amid fears for its growth prospects in a low interest rate environment across the major global economies. After the possible penalty was reported late on Thursday night by the Wall Street Journal, the bank issued an urgent statement in which it described the price as the \u201copening position\u201d by the DoJ. \u201cThe DoJ has invited the bank as the next step to submit a counter proposal,\u201d Deutsche said. \u201cDeutsche Bank has no intent to settle these potential civil claims anywhere near the number cited. The negotiations are only just beginning. The bank expects that they will lead to an outcome similar to those of peer banks which have settled at materially lower amounts.\u201d Until now, the DoJ has focused its RMBS investigations on US banks. The DoJ asked Citigroup to pay $12bn initially but the fine was eventually set at $7bn while Goldman reportedly faced a $15bn bill before agreeing to pay $5bn earlier this year. In 2014, Bank of America paid $16.7bn to US authorities to settle similar charges. Germany\u2019s finance ministry spokeswoman, Friederike von Tiesenhausen, also indicated that the matter was not over. \u201cThe government is aware that the US authorities have agreed similar settlement payments with other credit institutions. The government expects that at the end of this process a fair result will be achieved on the basis of equal treatment,\u201d she told Reuters. The potential penalty was described by German newspaper Handelsblatt as a \u201cminor catastrophe\u201d. It said: \u201cFor a bank of this calibre and complexity, this would be unacceptable and would practically force a capital increase.\u201d Deutsche has set aside \u20ac5.5bn for a string of legal claims and Ingo Frommen, banking analyst at German bank LBBW told Reuters: \u201cIf the final bill is at \u20ac5bn or more Deutsche Bank will not be able to avoid a capital hike anymore\u201d . There was some speculation that the scale of the fine had been prompted by the European commission\u2019s demand that Apple pay \u20ac13bn (\u00a311bn) in back taxes to Ireland and the possible impact of the looming US election. In the City, the focus quickly turned to RBS, which as recently as Monday was warning analysts that it would need to put more money aside to deal with any penalty from the DoJ for RMBS settlements. Analyst estimates for the scale of the charges on RBS \u2013 which has racked up more than \u00a350bn of losses since its 2008 bailout \u2013 range from \u00a34bn to \u00a39bn. While RBS had hoped to have agreed a deal with the US authorities last year, it has indicated that talks are not expected to begin until 2017. Deutsche\u2019s shares closed 8.4% lower at around \u20ac12 while RBS was off 4.4% at 185p \u2013 well below the 502p average per share price paid during the bail out \u2013 and Barclays was down 2.8% at 164p.",

    "webTitle": "BP's own modelling shows Great Australian Bight oil spill could reach NSW", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "An uncontrolled oil spill from BP\u2019s planned wells in the Great Australian Bight could affect the coastline as far away as New South Wales, according to previously secret oil-spill modelling uploaded to the company\u2019s website this week. Within 24 hours of the modelling being uploaded to BP\u2019s website, the regulator, the National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority (Nopsema) announced it would take a further 10 days to assess BP\u2019s plans to drill in the area. Nopsema\u2019s assessment of BP\u2019s environmental plan would now be completed on 29 September, it said on Friday. In 2015, frustrated by a lack of published modelling, the Wilderness Society had commissioned its own modelling, which suggested a spill would have a major impact on most of the southern coast of Australia and Tasmania. But the summary of official BP modelling showing what it considers a worst-case scenario appears to suggest a much more severe impact over a much larger area. According to BP\u2019s results, the NSW coast would have a 41% chance of being hit with \u201cmoderate shoreline contact\u201d within as little as 48 days of a spill in winter months. In some months, Adelaide would have a 97% chance of being hit with the same sort of contact, possibly within 36 days. Several areas were assessed as having a 100% chance of moderate shoreline contact in some months, including Port Lincoln, Kangaroo Island and the area between Elliston and Coffin Bay. BP has said it could completely cap blow-out within 35 days, but its modelling reveals many coastal areas could be hit before that happened. A spokeswoman for BP told Guardian Australia: \u201cAs part of our commitment to transparency, we have made these results available publicly. \u201cIt\u2019s important to remember that the modelling assumes that a worst credible discharge has taken place with no measures designed to prevent this from happening being considered. It also assumes that no attempts to control, contain, disperse or recover the oil are attempted \u2013 whereas in reality all these measures would be employed,\u201d she said. \u201cWe will be able to move oil spill response equipment anywhere in that area within two days.\u201d Wilderness Society campaigner Peter Owen told Guardian Australia the modelling justified the concerns the organisation had been raising. \u201cIt took 87 days to cap a blow-out in the Gulf of Mexico, which is one of the most developed oil fields in the world,\u201d Owen said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing nearby in the Great Australian Bight.\u201d \u201cModerate shoreline contact\u201d means water with 100 grams per square metre of oil on it. That is 10 times the amount needed for a \u201cmetallic sheen\u201d to be visible on the water. BP says when there is a metallic sheen there would already be mortality among seabirds and other marine wildlife. That level of spill would move further than the areas likely to be affected by \u201cmoderate shoreline contact\u201d and would affect fisheries. In the US, fisheries shut down with a concentration of just 0.01 grams per square metre. A spokesman for the Wilderness Society said: \u201cBP\u2019s latest spill modelling summary also finally admits to the unacceptable impact that a spill in the Bight could have on critically important ecological systems and marine species that Australia has clear international obligations to protect.\u201d This week the Guardian revealed that BP could drill in the Great Australian Bight using potentially faulty equipment, which the US regulator has said could cause a major disaster. A leading international expert on oil disasters, Bob Bea, said BP\u2019s response to the concerns was totally inadequate, and an \u201cearly warning sign\u201d of problems that could lead to a disaster. On Thursday the Senate agreed to launch fresh scrutiny of BP\u2019s plans, with two public hearings. BP has been contacted for comment.",

      "body": "<p>An uncontrolled oil spill from BP\u2019s planned wells in the Great Australian Bight could affect the coastline as far away as New South Wales, according to previously secret oil-spill modelling uploaded to the company\u2019s website this week.</p> <p>Within 24 hours of the modelling being uploaded to BP\u2019s website, the regulator, the National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority (Nopsema) announced it would take a further 10 days to assess BP\u2019s plans to drill in the area.</p> <p>Nopsema\u2019s assessment of BP\u2019s environmental plan would now be completed on 29 September, it said on Friday.</p> <p></p> <p>In 2015, frustrated by a lack of published modelling, the Wilderness Society had commissioned its own modelling, which suggested a spill would have a major impact on most of the southern coast of Australia and Tasmania.</p> <p>But the summary of official BP modelling showing what it considers a worst-case scenario appears to suggest a much more severe impact over a much larger area.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/sep/2016-09-16T04:14:01/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Oil spill impact on coastline\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/sep/2016-09-16T04:14:01/embed.html\">Oil spill impact on coastline</a> <figcaption>Chance coastal locations will be affected by a moderate oil spill in the Great Australian Bight</figcaption> </figure>  <p>According to BP\u2019s results, the NSW coast would have a 41% chance of being hit with \u201cmoderate shoreline contact\u201d<strong> </strong>within as little as 48 days of a<strong> </strong>spill in winter months.</p> <p>In some months, Adelaide would have a 97% chance of being hit with the same sort of contact, possibly within 36 days.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/16/oil-disaster-investigator-alarmed-by-bp-great-australian-bight-response\">Oil disaster investigator alarmed by BP Great Australian Bight response</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Several areas were assessed as having a 100% chance of moderate shoreline contact in some months, including Port Lincoln, Kangaroo Island and the area between Elliston and Coffin Bay.</p> <p>BP has said it could completely cap blow-out within 35 days, but its modelling reveals many coastal areas could be hit before that happened.</p> <p>A spokeswoman for BP told Guardian Australia: \u201cAs part of our commitment to transparency, we have made these results available publicly.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s important to remember that the modelling assumes that a worst credible discharge has taken place with no measures designed to prevent this from happening being considered. It also assumes that no attempts to control, contain, disperse or recover the oil are attempted \u2013 whereas in reality all these measures would be employed,\u201d she said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ab4fa2e2273588c5fbb972fdb2834011ee64adf3\"> <img src=\"https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2016/09/16/oilspill3.jpg\" alt=\"Locations around the Great Australian Bight\" width=\"620\" height=\"411\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe will be able to move oil spill response equipment anywhere in that area within two days.\u201d</p> <p>Wilderness Society campaigner Peter Owen told Guardian Australia the modelling justified the concerns the organisation had been raising.</p> <p>\u201cIt took 87 days to cap a blow-out in the Gulf of Mexico, which is one of the most developed oil fields in the world,\u201d Owen said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing nearby in the Great Australian Bight.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cModerate shoreline contact\u201d means water with 100 grams per square metre of oil on it. That is 10 times the amount needed for a \u201cmetallic sheen\u201d to be visible on the water. BP says when there is a metallic sheen there would already be mortality among seabirds and other marine wildlife.</p> <p>That level of spill would move further than the areas likely to be affected by \u201cmoderate shoreline contact\u201d and would affect fisheries. In the US, fisheries shut down with a concentration of just 0.01 grams per square metre.<br></p> <p>A spokesman for the Wilderness Society said: \u201cBP\u2019s latest spill modelling summary also finally admits to the unacceptable impact that a spill in the Bight could have on critically important ecological systems and marine species that Australia has clear international obligations to protect.\u201d</p> <p>This week <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/12/call-to-halt-great-australian-bight-oil-drilling-amid-faulty-equipment-fears\"> the Guardian revealed</a> that BP could drill in the Great Australian Bight using potentially faulty equipment, which the US regulator has said could cause a major disaster.</p> <p>A leading international expert on oil disasters, Bob Bea, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/16/oil-disaster-investigator-alarmed-by-bp-great-australian-bight-response\">said BP\u2019s response</a> to the concerns was totally inadequate, and an \u201cearly warning sign\u201d of problems that could lead to a disaster.</p> <p>On Thursday the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/15/senate-reopens-inquiry-into-plans-to-drill-in-great-australian-bight\">Senate agreed</a> to launch fresh scrutiny of BP\u2019s plans, with two public hearings.</p> <p>BP has been contacted for comment.</p>",
