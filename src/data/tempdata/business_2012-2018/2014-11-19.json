      "bodyText": "Royal Bank of Scotland is to be hit with \u00a350m of fines on Thursday after the collapse its computer systems in 2012, which left millions of customers shut out of their accounts for several days. In the latest embarrassment for the bailed-out bank, the penalty comes barely a week after it was fined \u00a3400m for failures that allowed the foreign exchange markets to be rigged for five years until 2013. The fines were prompted by the chaos caused when a problem with the bank\u2019s IT system left customers unable to access their cash at RBS, NatWest and Ulster Bank in June 2012. The meltdown hit not only customers of the three brands owned by the bank, but also people who were expecting salary payments from businesses that held accounts with the bank and other transfers between banks. The bank has been subject to an investigation by City regulators since April 2013 and admitted last month this had become an \u201cenforcement action\u201d \u2013 signalling that a fine was likely. RBS has previously described the breakdown in its IT system as unacceptable and vowed to spend \u00a31bn upgrading its computer systems. The problem emerged when a routine procedure failed to be complete. But it took days for RBS to correct the problem for customers at RBS and NatWest, and several weeks at Ulster Bank. The Irish authorities fined RBS \u00a32.7m last week for the Ulster Bank problems. RBS put aside \u00a3175m to compensate customers after the incident and has said no one has been left out of pocket as a result. The fines come at a time when the banking sector is facing renewed scrutiny after the punishments for foreign exchange rigging. Those investigations exposed a series of online chatroom dialogues, where dealers called themselves \u201cthe A team\u201d and \u201cthe three musketeers\u201d. RBS was one of six banks fined a total of \u00a32.6bn for allowing manipulation of the foreign exchange markets and the bank is expected to face further fines \u2013 not only related to currency markets but also to matters dating back to the sub-prime mortgage crisis in 2007. The bank has already been fined for rigging Libor, and earlier this year was fined \u00a314.5m in relation to its sale of mortgage products. The latest fines are to be handed out by the City regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), as well as the Bank of England\u2019s new regulatory body the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA). The fine from the PRA is expected to be smaller than that from the FCA but will be the first it has handed out since it was set up by the coalition to oversee the biggest banks and insurance companies. The PRA\u2019s fine will be for issues that may have caused a threat to the stability of the financial system, while the FCA will tackle issues that had an impact on customers. No one from RBS, the PRA or the FCA would comment on Wednesday.",

So what does the latest survey (April 2013/2014) tell us and what does it miss out?</p> <p>1. There is still slack in the economy</p> <p>The number of hours worked by each member of the labour force, on average, increased in 2012 and 2013, but has still <a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/ashe/annual-survey-of-hours-and-earnings/2014-provisional-results/stb-ashe-statistical-bulletin-2014.html#tab-Hours-worked\" title=\"\">not reached levels before the crash</a>, let alone those seen in the 1990s. ONS officials point to a decline in overtime during the recession as one cause, though it is less clear why the long-running trend to work fewer hours dates back to the workaholic 1980s. It is possible that an increase in family benefits since the 1980s, and especially the introduction of tax credits in 2003, have encouraged men to work less. The majority opinion on the BoE\u2019s monetary policy committee is that interest rates can remain at historic lows while there is excess slack. A minority view, put most forcibly by the BoE\u2019s Martin Weale, says the figures indicate a sructural shift to working lower hours and recent increases show the labour market is tightening, hitting a new, lower ceiling.</p> <p>2. There are wage pressures in the economy</p> <p>The overall earnings increase of 0.1% (or \u00a31 a week) between 2012 and 2013 made the headlines, but the Treasury took comfort from ASHE figures showing that workers in continuous employment saw their annual earnings rise by 4.1%.

According to the ONS around 70% of the workforce was in the same job in 2013 as in the previous year. And not only between 2013 and 2014. This cohort have enjoyed 4% earnings increases for the last three years. Can this be a reflection of pay rises to a large majority of people in continuous employment? It is hard to believe when figures from other surveys say wage deals have averaged 2-2.5% over the last couple of years. High streets will no doubt be packed with shoppers in the coming weeks, but it is difficult to believe that even those who survived he recession and kept their job can boast a compounded 20%-plus pay hike in the last three years.</p> <p>3.

Many employers say they desperately need new employees. To emphasise the point the monthly total of job vacancies has shot back towards boom year heights.

The academics from the University of Zurich used a sample of 128 employees of a large bank, and split them into two groups. The first set of bankers were primed to start thinking about their job, with questions such as \u201cwhat is your function at this bank?\u201d. They were then asked to toss a coin 10 times, in private, knowing which outcome would earn them $20 a flip. They then had to report their results online to claim any winnings. Unsurprisingly perhaps, there was cheating - with the percentage of winning tosses coming in at an incredibly fortunate 58.2% (although the research omitted to say how many bankers also trousered the coin). Meanwhile, the second group completed a survey about their wellbeing and everyday life, that did not include questions relating to their professional life. They then performed the coin-flipping task, which threw up a quite astonishing finding: these bankers proved honest. Identical exercises in other industries did not produce the same skewing in results when participants were primed to start thinking about their work. The research does not reveal which institution took part in the survey, presumably to avoid it suing the authors for unearthing some decent behaviour among the cheating. \u201cThe effect induced by the treatment could be attributable to several causes,\u201d the authors muse, \u201cincluding the competitiveness expected from bank employees, the exposure to competitive bonus schemes, the beliefs about what other employees would do in the same situation or the salience of money in the questionnaire.\u201d They add that the \u201cprevailing business culture in the banking industry may favour dishonest behaviour and could thus have contributed to the current loss of confidence in the industry,\u201d before concluding that measures to \u201cre-establish an honest culture in the financial sector are needed\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Almost \u00a3350m was wiped off the value of Britain\u2019s leading pub companies on Wednesday after MPs voted to effectively end the centuries-old beer tie. The move would give more freedom to tenants in pubs tied to large companies, but it immediately led to warnings of hundreds more pub closures and thousands of job losses. One City analyst said up to 12% could be wiped off the profits of the leading pub companies. Overturning government plans for industry reforms, MPs unexpectedly gave the go-ahead on Tuesday to an amendment allowing tenants to buy beer on the open market. Around half of Britain\u2019s 50,000 pubs are run by tenants under the beer tie, which mean they buy beer from the company which holds the pub lease. The beer is often bought at much higher prices than the market rate, in return for subsidised rent. The government had planned to allow publicans the right to challenge rental prices but had ruled out a rent-only option which would give them the chance to buy drinks from any supplier. This was the amendment which was unexpectedly passed, and marked a defeat for the chief whip, Michael Gove, and a victory for the cross-party free pubs campaign, headed by Liberal Democrat MP Greg Mulholland, with Labour support. Pubs are already closing at a rate of 13 a week, and Britain\u2019s largest pub companies warned worse could come if the amendment goes ahead. The biggest, Enterprise Inns, which operates 6,000 managed and leasehold pubs, said the move would have \u201cserious unintended consequences for publicans and the industry at large\u201d. Simon Townsend, chief executive, said: \u201cWe continue to believe the tie offers the best operating model for the vast majority of our publicans and ... we take a flexible approach to all our lease and tenancy agreements and the proactive management of our wider property portfolio. In light of [the] vote we will continue to assess all options to safeguard the interests of both our publicans and shareholders. In the meantime we will monitor the situation closely and await the government\u2019s response to this unwelcome development.\u201d Punch Taverns, which owns 4,000 pubs, said: \u201cThe government\u2019s own research indicated that breaking the tie would be expected to result in between 700 and 1,400 more pubs closing with 3,700 to 7000 job losses.\u201d It added that the amendment was likely \u201cto have the effect of reducing pub investment, reducing consumer choice and exposing tenants to higher fixed rents, reduced levels of support and greater risk of failure. \u201cWe are currently considering the potential impact of the amended bill on Punch, including the implications for our substantial pub investment program and our disposal plans.\u201d Punch was the biggest casualty on the stock market, down 25.5p or nearly 17% at 126p, closely followed by Enterprise, 20.5p lower at 102.6p. Marston\u2019s fell 4.7p to 142p, JD Wetherspoon lost 5p to 795p, Greene King was 35.5p lower at 750.5p, Mitchells &amp; Butlers lost 1.6p to 367.4p and Fuller, Smith &amp; Turner fell 5p to 915p. Spirit Pub Company, which is in the middle of being taken over by Greene King, lost 6.5p to 101.5p on concerns the deal might now be in jeopardy. Barclays analysts, however, said the move was unlikely to dissuade Greene King. Some analysts said the pub companies would fight the ruling. Deutsche Bank said: \u201cIs this a storm in a half-pint mug or a barrel of trouble? It could be seen as the latter, but is probably the former. The market rent-only option is against both UK government policy and competition law here and in the EU, and we would expect the pub industry to appeal this amendment all the way through the courts. Enterprise also has the \u2018nuclear\u2019 option of converting into a real estate investment trust.\u201d Richard Taylor at Barclays said: \u201cThere are a number of steps to this receiving Royal Assent, and we believe the pub companies may challenge whether such a change is legal, but this could have material consequences for the tenanted pub sector. \u201cWe estimate that the biggest impact would be on Enterprise Inns and Punch Taverns, which between them own over 9,000 tenanted pubs. We estimate the hit to pretax profit would [be] 9% at Enterprise and 12% at Punch.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "European markets saw most of their early gains wiped out ahead of the latest US Federal Reserve minutes, with mining shares coming under pressure as iron ore prices fell on concerns about the Chinese economy. In the end it was a mixed performance, with the UK market hit by a number of disappointing updates, notably the Royal Mail. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 12.53 points or 0.19% at 6696.60 Germany\u2019s Dax edged up 0.17% at 9472.80 France\u2019s Cac closed up 0.09% at 4266.19 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB added 0.14% to 19,379.92 But Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 0.54% at 10,376.8 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has pulled back from Tuesday\u2019s record highs, slipping 21 points or 0.12%. And on that note, it\u2019s time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Over to Greece, where officials are saying they are working overtime to unlock stalled relations with the country\u2019s troika of creditors. Our correspondent Helena Smith writes: Senior Greek officials say they have passed on by email \u201ca final set of proposals\u201d outlining the measures the government is willing to take to plug a fiscal hole in its 2015 budget. \u201cWe are expecting an answer by tomorrow at the latest,\u201d said one insider speaking on condition of anonymity. The Greek prime minister Antonis Samaras is also believed to have hit the phones in a bid to break the impasse. He may start visiting EU capitals, aides say, to convey the government\u2019s fear of the \u201cpolitical cost\u201d further cost-cutting measures would have. Digging in their heels, mission chiefs representing the EU, IMF and ECB have reportedly stepped up demands, saying they will only return \u201cat staff level\u201d to the Greek capital once it is clear the ruling coalition is willing to implement reforms. Hopes of a solution being found in time for auditors to complete their review of the economy by December 8 when euro area finance ministers hold their last euro group meeting of the year, are fading fast. Well-briefed sources say the troika has toughened its stance precisely because of the political instability speculation of early elections has sparked in Greece. Some suggest that the turmoil may well continue into the New Year, dashing hopes of Athens launching talks on a \u201cprecautionary credit line,\u201d the centerpiece of a follow-up program that would replace the financial adjustment, or bailout, accord that has governed Greece\u2019s relations with creditors since the debt-stricken country sought international emergency funding. Amid growing calls for feuding politicians to break the gridlock, the radical left main opposition Syriza party announced that its leader, Antonis Tsipras, would be willing to meet Samaras (the two men have had almost no contact over the past year) but highlighting the degree to which consensus is missing from Greece\u2019s fractious political arena, stipulated that such talks could not take place if Evangelos Venizelos, the deputy premier, was present. \u201cWe think that [the presence of] Venizelos would be unnecessary,\u201d said Panos Skourletis the party\u2019s spokesman insisting that Samaras, alone, should be able to convey the government\u2019s views. The finance ministry will present next year\u2019s budget to the Greek parliament on Friday, it announced. And after some confusion about the figures, there does indeed seem to be a Swiss poll ahead of this month\u2019s gold referendum: Gold is falling sharply on various rumours going round the markets, including supposed hawkish comments in the forthcoming Federal Reserve minutes. There was also talk that a new poll would show a majority against new gold reserve limits in the forthcoming Swiss referendum (on November 30). A yes vote would be expected to boost gold prices, said analysts, so a negative outcome would be likely to send the precious metal in the opposite direction. And Reuters now has a more detailed report on Dr Shafik\u2019s appearance at the Treasury committee: The Bank of England\u2019s regulatory arm will scrutinise bonuses awarded to traders involved in attempts to manipulate the currency market, a top official said on Wednesday. BoE Deputy Governor Minouche Shafik said some of the banks fined last week for attempting to manipulate the foreign exchange market were already clawing back bonus awards for traders that were involved. The BoE\u2019s Prudential Regulation Authority supervises banks in Britain. \u201cI would certainly say that we will look at their remuneration proposals when we get them in January,\u201d she told parliament\u2019s Treasury Committee. \u201cThese are clearly egregious cases of misconduct and one would hope to see remuneration committees in these firms will use these powers they have to hold these individuals to account,\u201d Shafik added. Some banks have dipped into bonus pools to pay recent fines, which sends a very strong signal, she added. Here\u2019s some early Reuters snaps from Dr Shafik\u2019s comments at the select committee: 19-Nov-2014 15:18 - BANK OF ENGLAND\u2019S SHAFIK SAYS WE WOULD EXPECT BANKS TO USE POWERS TO CLAW BACK BONUSES FROM INDIVIDUALS IN ALLEGED FOREX RIGGING 19-Nov-2014 15:20 - BANK OF ENGLAND\u2019S SHAFIK SAYS DON\u2019T ATTACH MUCH CREDIBILITY TO VIEW FIRMS COULD LEAVE UK BECAUSE OF MISCONDUCT PENALITIES 19-Nov-2014 15:25 - BOE\u2019S SHAFIK SAYS AGREE IN PRINCIPLE THAT EVEN JUNIOR WORKERS COULD COME UNDER BONUS DEFERRAL RULES, TOUGHER IN PRACTICE Nemat (Minouche) Shafik, deputy governor of the Bank of England since August, is up before the Treasury Select Committee, talking about the foreign exchange markets. Link to the live stream is here. US markets have opened and ahead of the lastest Federal Reserve minutes, due to be released later, they have got off to a downbeat start. After Tuesday\u2019s new record - yes, yet another one - the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 41 points or 0.23% in early trading. Mixed signals from the US housing market. After Tuesday\u2019s report showing housebuilders were increasingly confident about the outlook, comes news that housing starts fell unexpectedly in October. They dropped 2.8% to a annual rate of 1.009m houses compared to expectations of a 1.025m rate. But it was the multi-family home segment, which tends to be more volatile, which accounted for the decline. Starts for single-family homes, the largest part of the market, rose to their highest level in a year. A quick lunchtime recap. Royal Mail shares have been savaged this morning after the postal operator reported a 21% drop in operating profits, and warned that Amazon taking chunks out of the parcel market. They are currently down 7.5% at 433p. Analysts warn that Christmas will be absolutely crucial for the company, floated 13 months ago. New data from the Office for National Statistics show that Britons suffered another year of falling real wages, with little progress in closing the gender pay gap. The Bank of England remains split over interest rates; the minutes of its last meeting show that two policymakers voted to raise rates, while the seven who voted for \u2018no change\u2019 are divided over the risks to the economy. And investors in pub companies are nursing a nasty hangover after MPs voted to loosen the rules that tie landlords into buying beer from the companies who own their pub. Shares in pub companies have been pummelled. The news that average real wages shrank by another 1.6% in the 12 months to April has been seized, with gusto, by the opposition Labour party. Ed Balls, shadow chancellor, says it undermines the government\u2019s argument that the economy has been fixed. \u201cWorking people are worse off under David Cameron\u2019s government and millions face a further hit if the Tories win the election. David Cameron and George Osborne have promised to cut tax credits again while keeping a \u00a33 billion a year tax cut for the top one per cent of earners. \u201cWe need a recovery for the many, not just a few at the top. Labour\u2019s economic plan will tackle the cost-of-living crisis and earn our way to higher living standards for all. Our plan will raise the minimum wage, boost apprenticeships, get 200,000 new homes built a year and expand free childcare for working parents. \u201cAnd we will balance the books in the next Parliament, but do so in a fairer way - starting by reversing David Cameron\u2019s tax cut for millionaires.\u201d On the other hand, the figures do show that the majority of employees who have remained in the same job for at least one year did better than average. Their pay rose by 2.4% once you adjust for inflation..... ....although if you\u2019re a government minister, you might prefer to ignore inflation: The Bank of England minutes are a little more hawkish than expected, says Martin Beck, senior economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club. He points to the line about a \u201cmaterial spread of views\u201d among MPC members about inflationary risks....but still doesn\u2019t think rates will rise for several months. Despite the widening of viewpoints among the MPC\u2019s doves, we think that the majority in favour of keeping rates on hold won\u2019t be disappearing anytime soon. As a result, a rate rise won\u2019t happen until well into 2015. \u201cWith the MPC forecasting that CPI inflation will drop below 1% in the next few months and remain below the 2% target for the next three years, it begs the question why the MPC isn\u2019t taking action to loosen policy now.\u201d The average full time male worker earned 9.4% more than their female counterpart, according to today\u2019s data. That shows that more needs to be done to close Britain\u2019s gender pay gap, says TUC General Secretary Frances O\u2019Grady: \u201cIt\u2019s good to see the gender pay gap narrowing again. But after last year\u2019s widening we\u2019re only back to where we were in 2012. \u201cPart-time women\u2019s pay still lags some way behind that of their full-time colleagues. Nearly six million women work part-time and they earn \u00a35.15 less per hour than full-time men. Two in five of part-time women earn less than the living wage. \u201cWe need better paid, flexible, part-time work opportunities, and better paid leave for fathers to encourage more equal parenting. \u201cThe full-time gender pay gap may have closed for younger women but it widens dramatically for women in their 40s and 50s. Far too many women still find they have to take a step down to access flexible or reduced hours once they become mothers, and their earnings never recover even when they return to full-time work.\u201d Here\u2019s some sobering news - UK real wages have fallen for the sixth year running. New figures from the Office for National Statistics today show the full scale of the squeeze on living standards, as earnings have stagnated in the face of economic \u2018recovery\u2019. Real pay, adjusted for inflation, fell by 1.6% this year, with gross weekly earnings barely growing at all. My colleague Angela Monaghan has analysed the data, and reports: The figures laid bare the financial pressures that continue to weigh on UK households, despite falling unemployment and economic recovery which has put the economy on course to grow by about 3% this year. Policymakers at the Bank of England have persistently cited unexpectedly weak wage growth as one of the reasons why interest rates remain at an all-time low of 0.5%, unchanged since March 2009. And there\u2019s been hardly any progress in closing the gender pay gap: Full story here: UK workers hit by sixth year of falling real pay Shares in Royal Mail have now slumped by around 9%, as the City digests this morning\u2019s results. The postal operator is the biggest faller on the FTSE 100 today, down 43.7p to 425.3p. The company will have been briefing analysts this morning, after reporting a 21% drop in profits and saying Amazon is eating into the parcels business (as covered earlier) Brenda Kelly of IG Index says that investors have noted Royal Mail\u2019s warning that Amazon\u2019s competitive delivery network means the parcels market will only grow half as fast as expected. We can expect more of the same from Royal Mail, while the expectation of hitting targets for the full-year hinges on a good Christmas and thus the risk of disappointment is high. Analysts at Jeffries are also concerned. The outlook for the parcel market is worse than expected, with expected volume growth of only 1%-2% for around 2 years, which implies parcel revenues would remain stable at best. This effect would be somewhat mitigated by higher than expected cost savings, but on balance we think the outlook has further deteriorated. Worth remembering that business secretary Vince Cable warned several times that there was \u2018froth\u2019 on Royal Mail\u2019s share price, after it spiked after privatisation. Not much comfort for shareholders who have held onto their stakes. The pound has risen almost half a cent against the US dollar since the Bank minutes came out, to $1.567. This suggesting that some traders had expected an 8-1 or 9-0 vote on interest rates, with Weale or McCafferty, or both, dropping their call for rate rises. Nicholas Ebisch, currency analyst for Caxton FX, says: The inflation report cited the risks to the UK economy and that supporting inflation is still the top priority. The market may have priced more MPC members voting against an interest rate rise this morning, but the unchanged vote figures bode well for sterling. Today\u2019s minutes reinforce expectations that UK interest rates won\u2019t rise until the back end of next year, reckons Jake Trask, corporate dealer at UKForex: \u201cSeven MPC members saw concerns over low inflation, sluggish wage growth and falling exports due to a stagnating Eurozone economy \u2013 obstacles that need to be negotiated before they would consider a rate rise. \u201cIt now seems likely that the earliest we can expect a hike is late 2015, though some are not forecasting an increase until 2016, especially if the situation in the Eurozone deteriorates further.\u201d Reaction to the Bank of England minutes is coming in. Jeremy Cook, chief economist of World First, isn\u2019t convinced by the argument from the Bank\u2019s two hawks that wages will start to rise as \u2018slack\u2019 is mopped up \u201cWe hope this is true but we have heard this line from policymakers before and yet, have seen very little upwards pressure on wages in recent months.\u201d My colleague Nick Fletcher explains why UK pub shares are being hammered today: Pub company shares are heading into the slops tray after MPs voted to give tenants more freedom over buying their beer. Overturning government plans for industry reforms, MPs unexpectedly gave the go-ahead to an amendment to allow tenants to buy beer on the open market. Around half of Britain\u2019s 50,000 pubs are run by tenants under the beer-tie which mean they buy beer from the company which holds the pub lease - this is often at higher prices than the market rate in return for subsidised rent.... Full story: Pub shares slump after MPs vote to give tenants free choice of beer And a hat-tip and a bag of pork scratchings to fastFT for this chart, showing the scale of the rout: The BoE minutes also show that there was \u201ca material spread of views on the balance of risks to the outlook\u201d among the seven members of the MPC who voted to keep rates at 0.5%. Some MPC members sound rather dovish, concerned that UK growth will fall faster than expected. In that case a premature tightening in policy would leave the economy vulnerable to shocks, with the scope for any stimulus that subsequently became necessary being limited by the effective lower bound on interest rates. Others, though, are more hawkish; reckoning that the spare capacity in the economy could be used up faster than expected. That would potentially result in inflation rising to, and subsequently overshooting, the 2% target. Individual members ascribed materially different probabilities to these risks. In other words, the MPC can\u2019t really agree about what\u2019s happening in the UK economy.... The minutes show that Martin Weale and Ian McCafferty argued, in vain, that the MPC should ignore the fact UK inflation had fallen to a five-year low in September. After all, the committee resisted hiking rates when rising oil prices drove inflation up a few years ago, so it should resist keeping them low now. The minute say: For two members, economic circumstances continued to justify an immediate rise in Bank Rate. While CPI inflation was well below the target, this was largely the effect of the higher exchange rate and lower raw material prices. Just as the Committee had looked through the first-round effect of external price pressures when they had pushed inflation up, it was appropriate to look through them at present when they were pushing inflation down. The Bank of England minutes are online here. The Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee voted 7-2 on whether to leave interest rates unchanged this month, according to the minutes of the meeting (which took place a fortnight ago). They show that Martin Weale and Ian McCafferty voted, again, to raise borrowing costs to 0.75%. They argued that wage growth could pick up sharply in the months ahead, as the labour market tightens. Their seven colleagues, though, voted to leave them at their current record low of 0.5%. More to follow... And here\u2019s our news story on Royal Mail\u2019s results: You can see Royal Mail\u2019s results here. Royal Mail had hoped that growth in parcel deliveries would cover the decline in its letters business, as more people order items online. But as Michael Hewson of CMC Markets explains, it\u2019s an increasingly tough market: The explosion in on-line retailing, click and collect delivery and the use of mobile apps this year is likely to see fierce competition between logistics providers with UK Mail, UPS and Fedex likely to provide plenty of competition, while the recent tie-up between Amazon and Connect Group to provide a 24 hour service for parcel delivery to selected local locations, like underground stations, newsagents and shopping centres, could make a significant dent in Royal Mail\u2019s revenue particularly since Amazon is Royal Mail\u2019s largest parcel customer. This will inevitably place greater focus on Parcelforce\u2019s volumes, as more and more people choose to pick up their parcel at a location more convenient to their day to day needs. City firm Panmure Gordon reckons that Royal Mail is performing broadly in line with expectations, but faces a struggle to grow: With limited revenue growth potential in the near term, it\u2019s down on-going cost control to improve earnings. Shares in several British pub chains have slumped faster than a well-watered regular at last orders, after MPs voted to loosen the controls on tied landlords. The vote was an embarrassing defeat for the government. It will mean that around 15,000 tied landlords will be able to buy beer on the open market rather than stuck with one company. They\u2019ll also be able to have their rent independently assessed. Shares in Britain\u2019s biggest pub landlord, Enterprise Inns, have crashed by 13% as I type, and other companies are also hurting. Campaigners believe that breaking these ties will help pubs stay in business, but the industry has argued that it will lead to more pubs closing. After that early rally, Royal Mail shares are now down 1% at 463p as investors digest its warning that the parcels business is challenging. Royal Mail\u2019s results are fairly unimpressive, reckons Richard Hunter, head of equities at Hargreaves Lansdown Stockbrokers. Here\u2019s his take: \u201cHaving completed its first full year as a listed company, Royal Mail is now facing the harsh realities with the initial share price euphoria having waned. Most of the key metrics are flat to negative, with a decrease in operating profit, margin and earnings per share accompanied by an increase in costs. The quiet emergence of Amazon in the parcels space, already a fiercely competitive arena, could become a medium term threat, whilst the company openly concedes in its outlook that the Christmas period will set the tone for the full year performance. More positively, the European parcels business performed well once more, the decline in letters was less than expected in the period (although it remains an area of terminal decline), whilst the projected dividend yield of 4.4% is supportive in the current interest rate environment. This chart shows how Royal Mail shares had rallied in the last couple of months, having fallen back during spring and summer to as low as 390p. However, it doesn\u2019t show that shares were actually sold at 330p, so anyone who took part in the float has profited (including the City firms who got preferential treatment in the IPO, and sold shortly afterwards). Royal Mail shares have risen by 1.3% at the start of trading in London, gaining 6.1p to 475p. Today\u2019s results are a little better than expected (Analysts had predicted that operating profits would fall by 30% in the six months to 30 September, not the 21% reported). At 475p, Royal Mail shares are still around 43% above the 330p at which they were sold in October 2013. At their peak, in early 2014, they were trading at over \u00a36. Today\u2019s results include a plea to the government and regulators to rewrite Royal Mail\u2019s Universal Service obligations. We think there is an urgent need for a new framework that will secure the sustainable provision of the Universal Service for the future. Currently, Royal Mail is obliged to deliver to every home in the UK from Monday to Saturday, for a fixed price (more details here). New entrants to the market don\u2019t have this restriction - giving them (it claims) a \u201cstructural cost advantage\u201d and the ability to \u201ccherry-pick the services they offer\u201d. Royal Mail is governed by the USO until 2021; MPs from rural constituencies have already voiced concerns that the company might try to get it watered down once it were privatised..... The 1% increase in letter revenues was mainly due to \u201celection mailings\u201d, Royal Mail says (such as the May\u2019s European elections and local council ballots). That could be a profitable area for the company next year too, with a general election due in May.) Royal Mail has also halved its forecast for growth in its parcels division, as web giant Amazon continues to eat into the sector. It says: We estimate Amazon\u2019s own delivery network will reduce the annual rate of growth in the UK addressable market to 1-2% for approximately two years. Last month, Amazon launched a same-day delivery service which allowed customers to pick up items at local newsagents and high street shops, through a tie-up with distribution group Smiths News. If that service takes off, it is likely to bleed business away from parcel delivery firms. Royal Mail had already suffered from Amazon\u2019s decision to scrap free \u201csuper-saver\u201d delivery on items worth less than \u00a310. Royal Mail has warned that the UK parcels market is a tough and \u201chighly competitive\u201d place to operate, after reporting that profits have fallen. The firm, privatised 13 months ago, just reported that pre-tax profits, stripping out one-off items, fell by 6% in the six months to 29 September 2014, from \u00a3233m to \u00a3218m. Revenues from parcels fell by 1% during the half-year, it warned, wiping out some of the benefits of a 1% rise in revenues from delivering letters.: And on an operating level, profits are down by over 20% to \u00a3279m, from \u00a3353m a year earlier. Moya Greene, CEO, says she is \u201cpleased\u201d with the overall performance, with Royal Mail keeping \u201ctight cost control\u201d. But... \u201cThe UK parcels market remains challenging. As the pre-eminent UK parcels delivery company, we are targeting a number of new, growing areas, and delivered two per cent volume growth in a competitive market. We had a better than expected performance in UK letters. GLS, our European parcels business, demonstrated a strong performance with better than expected volumes in domestic and export parcels. \u201cOur performance remains in line with our expectations for the full year. But, as always, this depends on us delivering another great Christmas, for which we are fully prepared.\u201d More details and reaction to follow... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the economy, business and the eurozone. Coming up today.... Royal Mail is releasing its financial results for the first half of the year; full coverage of that from 7am GMT. The Bank of England releases the minutes of this month\u2019s monetary policy committee meeting, at 9.30am. That will show whether the committee was still split 7-2 on whether to leave interest rates unchanged. BoE deputy governor Minouche Shafik is testifying to parliament\u2019s Treasury committee this afternoon (2.45pm), on the bank\u2019s Fair and Efficient Markets review. That\u2019s its bid to raise standards across the City and put an end to the stream of scandals. Speaking of central banks.....overnight, the Bank of Japan has repeated its commitment to a more aggressive stimulus plan. Eight out of nine BoJ policymakers backed the plan to expand the country\u2019s money supply, in the light of the country\u2019s latest recession. Last month it was only five.... And we\u2019ll be watching Greece, where the government and its lenders are (again) struggling to reach agreement on whether it has met the terms of its bailout (as covered in yesterday\u2019s blog)",

      "bodyText": "After four days of rises, leading shares paused for breath, hit by a fall in mining shares and some disappointing company updates. One of the biggest fallers was Icap. The interdealer broker\u2019s shares dropped 43.5p or 10% to 386p after it reported a worse than expected 9% fall in first half revenues, with profits down 38% to \u00a386m due to uncertain trading conditions. It said it was cautiously optimistic about recent signs of a pick-up but said it had not changed its expectations for the full year since it was too soon to say whether this upturn would continue. News that its shipping arm was in merger talks with rival Howe Robinson did little to enthuse the market. Analysts at Canaccord Genuity downgraded their rating, saying: Trading conditions remain tough as regulations continue to curtail volumes in the interdealer market and low volatility compresses spreads. We expect headline revenue growth to remain challenging at least in the near to medium term. We expect current consensus earnings per share growth to be challenging despite current cost saving measures. We retain our target price of 350p and cut our recommendation to sell (from hold). Numis said: Icap is currently trading on a 2015 PE of 14.5 times which is a premium to Tullett (9.5 times) but a notable discount to a wider peer group of interdealer brokers, global exchanges and information service providers (average 18.5 times). We believe this fairly reflects the ongoing investigations in the US and Europe that in our view, represent substantial operational risks to the group. We expect to downgrade our full year estimates following these results by 5%-10%. Meanwhile the company later announced that chief executive Michael Spencer had bought an interest of 250,000 Icap shares at 395.95p each by means of a contract for difference. This takes his total interest to 16.91%. Overall the FTSE 100 slipped 12.53 points to 6696.60 ahead of the minutes of teh last US Federal Reserve meeting, when it finally ended its quantitative easing programme. As iron ore prices continued to slide, Anglo American lost 40p to \u00a313.23, Rio Tinto dropped 62p to \u00a329.42 and BHP Billiton was down 35p to \u00a316.25. Among the companies disappointing the market were Royal Mail, down 39.2p or 8% to 430p, and testing group Intertek, 206p lower at \u00a324.47. Pubs groups were on the slide after MPs effectively cut the centuries old beer tie, with Enterprise Inns down 20.5p at 102.6p. But Severn Trent bubbled up 58p to \u00a320.81 as analysts at HSBC moved from underweight to neutral and raised their target price from \u00a318.90 to \u00a320.80.",

      "bodyText": "Motor insurers have come under pressure recently on worries about lower premiums and earnings. But esure has rebounded after Exane BNP Paribas turned more positive, raising its recommendation from neutral to outperform. Its shares are currently 3.2p higher at 200.2p. Analyst Andy Hughes said: Following negative guidance from all the motor insurers at the third quarter, consensus earnings forecasts are in significant decline, with many cutting forecasts by 15%. More importantly, lower earnings growth points to lower dividend growth and exerts pressure on existing dividend levels. At the back of investors\u2019 minds must be the food retail sector, where competition has depressed earnings and dividends. The next data point that the market will likely focus on is premium rate trends in the fourth quarter. Our expectation is that despite comments in the third quarter of flat premiums (Admiral), the scale of the increase in bodily injury claims and the fall in fuel prices should see prices rise in the fourth (we expect a 5% bounce). Monthly data from Moneysupermarket.com (up 8.8% in October from August lows) supports this view; furthermore, the fourth quarter has historically been strong. All this comes after August saw aggressive and heavy underwriting.

However, given the delay in any price increase earning through, this will not materially boost 2015 forecasts. The share price reaction is likely to be positive regardless. On esure, he said: Esure shares have performed poorly (down 25% over three months, down 18% year to date) and are likely to recover if market prices rise in the fourth quarter. We believe the fourth quarter premium index will be a positive near-term catalyst for the stock. We expect Esure has a very limited exposure to periodic payment orders (less than 5% of claims reserves) and we expect limited exposure to large claims due to the reinsurance program. However, it has been the most sensitive to market rate trends, which have been poor but are expected to look more positive in the fourth quarter. We expect this will surprise markets as companies have been guiding down forecasts, which reflects the situation of premiums increases lagging claims.

      "bodyText": "British workers suffered a sixth straight year of falling real pay in 2014, taking earnings back to levels last seen at the turn of the century, according to official figures. Pay, when adjusted for inflation, was 1.6% lower this year than in 2013, the Office for National Statistics said in its annual survey of hours and earnings. Weak wage growth has persistently been outstripped by inflation meaning workers have seen their real pay fall every year since 2008, back to the levels they were paid in the early 2000s. Median gross weekly earnings for full-time employees barely grew this year, rising by just \u00a31 to \u00a3518 in April 2014 compared with 2013. It was the smallest rate of growth since the ONS started the survey 17 years ago. The figures laid bare the financial pressures that continue to weigh on UK households, despite falling unemployment and economic recovery which has put the economy on course to grow by about 3% this year. Policymakers at the Bank of England have persistently cited unexpectedly weak wage growth as one of the reasons why interest rates remain at an all-time low of 0.5%, unchanged since March 2009. The gender pay gap - which measures the disparity between what men and women earn - narrowed to 9.4% in 2014 from 10% in 2013. It was the lowest since records began in 1997, when the pay gap was 17.4%. Although a reduction in the gender gap is obviously welcome news, it is a small drop of just 0.6 percentage points. The median hourly earnings for full-time workers show that men still earn 9.4% more than women, which is still wide compared to many advanced economies. Commenting on the report, the chancellor, George Osborne, said: \u201cThese figures also show that the gender pay gap has fallen significantly and now stands at its lowest level since records began - another sign of real progress in the fight for equal pay. \u201cThe great recession made our country poorer but the only way to improve living standards is to continue working through the plan that\u2019s delivering a brighter economic future.\u201d In a separate report, the ONS said there were 236,000 jobs - 0.9% of employee jobs - which paid less than the national minimum wage (NMW) in April 2014. Among 16 to 17 year olds the figure is just under 3% at 9,000. This is accounting for a revision in the methodology used, which looks at the apprentice national minimum wage rate. Based on the old methodology, 1.2% of jobs would be below minimum wage - a 0.1 percentage point increase on last year. Bar staff and waiters and waitresses were among the occupations most likely to be low paid. At the other end of the scale, low pay was least prevalent in professional occupations. In April 2014, the NMW was \u00a36.31 for employees aged 21 and over, \u00a35.03 for employees aged 18 to 20, \u00a33.72 for employees aged 16 to 17, and \u00a32.68 for apprentices aged 16 to 18 and those aged 19 or over who are in the first year of their apprenticeship.",

      "bodyText": "Marks &amp; Spencer has unveiled the summer fashion collections that could save or cost its chief executive his job. The new ranges are due to arrive in store in the spring, when the City will demand concrete evidence that Marc Bolland\u2019s turnaround plan is working. Clothing sales have been in decline for more than three years, but recent figures have pointed to an improving trend at the high-street chain. Womenswear sales rose by 1.3% in the first five months of the year, before a poor September widely blamed on the unseasonably warm weather. It was a modest upswing, but the share price rose sharply as profit margins improved and the dividend payout was lifted. The retailer\u2019s new fashion team, led by former Jaeger boss Belinda Earl, has cut the number of cardigans and is backing jackets to be big sellers instead, with sporty bomber jackets, kimono-style wraps and light duster coats the order of the day. After an era in which M&amp;S fashion swung wildly between seasons of ultra trend-led collections (customer verdict: scary) and seasons of sensible, safe pieces (customer verdict: boring), the 70-strong design team led by Earl has worked hard to develop a consistent pitch, with enough fashion newness to make the clothes feel confident and exciting, balanced against accessibility in their design, pricing and merchandising. For instance, in the spring/summer 2015 catwalks, many blouses and sweaters were shown cropped to the waist, displaying a sliver of skin above the waistband of skirts or trousers. The silhouette has been embraced by M&amp;S for next season, but a burnt-orange silk blouse in this style in the spring 2015 collection has, after much design-room discussion, been given an extra inch of fabric at the hem, \u201cbecause our customer doesn\u2019t want to show her tummy,\u201d says Frances Russell, trading director. This accessibility in design is carried through into pricing and merchandise. The flagship Best of British range, which is entirely produced in the UK, has been extended at lower price points. Jersey dresses, made in Leicestershire and retailing at \u00a359.99, now make up a bigger part of the collection than more expensive tailoring. More mannequins are used in store, to \u201cinspire, show a new silhouette, and give ideas of the different ways to wear the pieces\u201d, says Earl. For instance, the spring range features several versions of the \u2018co-ord\u2019 \u2013 a structured T-shirt top with matching skirt \u2013 which will be displayed as outfits on mannequins, and broken up into separates on the rail. The headline trend at M&amp;S next season will be a seventies revival reflecting an influence on shows as diverse as Tommy Hilfiger and Prada, Saint Laurent and MaxMara. At M&amp;S, the seventies will be neatly divided into a preppy, Ali McGraw look for the early season (suede, midi-skirts, works for cool-weather) and a breezy, bohemian collection for high summer (Broderie Anglaise, sheer blouses, holiday tunics.) The retailer believes the look can have a wide appeal, with shoppers able to choose from a luxury tan suede midi-skirt for \u00a3199, or a similar style in suedette for \u00a339.99, for example. The store is also getting new clothes on to the rails more often, with new items available every two weeks rather than every six, in line with rivals such as Zara. Fashion \u201cis the most crucial driver in making women buy clothes\u201d, says Earl. \u201cOur customer likes innovation and she values quality, but it is fashion that creates the desire.\u201d In a problematically warm autumn \u2013 among Earl\u2019s team the weather is referred to, with wry humour, as \u201cthe W word\u201d \u2013 highlights have been strong sales of jumpsuits, and fashion-led coat styles such as blanket wraps. Summer is even more unpredictable, with quirky must-haves influenced not only by weather but by streetstyle looks and festival-inspired flash trends. \u201cThe drumbeat of our phasing is much quicker these days,\u201d says Russell. \u201cNew pieces in store every two weeks, rather than six, and a more responsive design process so that we can read the sales and react to them.\u201d Fashion motivates purchases, but quality is still what M&amp;S rely on to convince women to buy those clothes at M&amp;S rather than a cheaper rival. Innovation in fabric and technology \u2013 the no-peep shirt, non-iron linen trousers, \u2018airbrushed\u2019 sheer hosiery for a slimming effect \u2013 are as important to M&amp;S as being on-trend. Shifts in lifestyle are also as important as catwalk trends, and the rise in status of workout clothing is reflected both in a new range of high-tech sports bras, and in \u201cathwear\u201d detailing in fashion ranges: a silky vest has mesh segments and white piping, while silky tracksuit bottoms are styled with high heels.",
