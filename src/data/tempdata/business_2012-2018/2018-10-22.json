      "bodyText": "Some 20 years after the first DVD players went on sale, they\u2019re history. John Lewis won\u2019t be restocking when the current players have sold out, the retailer said, after a 40% dive in sales this year. The DVD player\u2019s demise is revealed in the annual snapshot of buying trends compiled by the department store group. A number of other devices and electricals are also in steep decline: sales of alarm clocks are down 16%, prompting the retailer to reduce its range by nearly a third, while desktop computers are down 15%. Sales of trouser presses are down by 36%. The department store is also knocking out fewer door knockers \u2013 sales are down 9% this year . Only 56% of UK households now own a DVD player according to the market research firm Mintel, down from 83% in 2012. About a quarter of us still own a Blu-ray player, which John Lewis will keep selling. Matt King, category director for technology and media research at Mintel, said streaming had killed the DVD: \u201cRising subscriptions to Netflix, Amazon Prime Video and other streaming services mean that people have instant access to a huge range of content without worrying about delivery times for DVDs or storage space. \u201cThere is still demand for physical media and there will be for some time, but it will focus on the Blu-ray market, as DVDs are widely seen as outdated.\u201d Huge televisions, retro trainers, thongs and fashion items modelled by Meghan Markle are on the up, said the department store chain. The World Cup helped drive the trend for large televisions: sales of TVs with at least 70-inch screens almost doubled in the first half of this year compared to the same period in 2017, while there was a 34% decline in sales of sets with under 31-inch screens. John Lewis put the return of thongs \u2013 after years of falling sales \u2013 down to the popularity of reality TV show Love Island, participants in which favoured micro swimwear, as well as figure-hugging retro trends such as cycling shorts and the sort of slip dresses sported by the Kardashian clan. Sales of thongs were up 72% in the past year, according to the report, but Charlie Teather, fashion editor of Glamour magazine, said the barely there lingerie was unlikely to go mainstream even though they are a lot more comfy than they used to be. For fashion-conscious men, it\u2019s all about the retro white trainer \u2013 with sales up 53% this year. The Duchess of Sussex has quickly become a major influence on shopping patterns. Meghan Markle boosted sales of Mulberry\u2019s \u00a3550 Darley bag more than four-fold (327%) after she stepped out with one on her shoulder on Commonwealth Day. Similarly, sales of yellow dresses soared 400% after she wore a bright-yellow shift dress at a reception. But it was not just women wearing yellow. It was the colour of the summer for men, too, with sales of menswear featuring the colour up 92%, beating khaki green, which was up 45%, and pink, up 29%. The nation was also going green, as BBC series Blue Planet II took sustainability mainstream. Sales of reusable cups rose 71% in the four months following the series as shoppers tried to cut down on single-use plastic. Vegan beauty products were up 12% and sales of reusable water bottles climbed 37%. John Lewis said sustainable alternatives to tin foil and cling film from brands like Stasher and Bees Wrap have also been selling well. But the most influential device of the year was the mobile phone, which is now used for 42% of visits to the John Lewis website, up from 17% a year ago. It is now the most popular way of browsing \u2013 but shoppers move to something a little larger when they actually make a purchase. Just over half of online sales are still made using a desktop, while 22% come through tablets. \u201cShoppers still like to make bigger, more considered purchases via desktop but it is clear that mobile is catching up,\u201d John Lewis says in its How we Shop Look and Live report, which was published on Tuesday. The rise of the mobile and online shopping is hammering traditional retailers, which are having to race to adapt to home deliveries while sales sink at high street stores. The department store chain slumped to a \u00a319.3m first-half loss this year, compared with a \u00a354.4m profit in 2017, as it invested in IT systems and put services ranging from manicures to personal shopping into more stores to help attract customers. It was also forced to cut prices to match heavy discounts at struggling rivals House of Fraser and Debenhams.",

      "bodyText": "\u201cWe expect more failures this winter,\u201d said Michael O\u2019Leary. Ryanair\u2019s chief executive, thankfully, wasn\u2019t warning of more failures to remove passengers who racially abuse fellow travellers. Nor was he referring to Ryanair\u2019s unacceptable corporate failure to apologise to Delsie Gayle, the customer subjected to the attack. Rather, he was predicting that some smaller rivals will go bust, which seems a reasonable bet. Most of the usual ingredients for a crisis among small European airlines are in place. First, oil prices \u2013 and thus the cost of jet fuel \u2013 are rising and many airlines haven\u2019t sufficiently hedged the financial risks. Second, interest rates in the US are rising, which is supporting the dollar, the currency in which oil is priced. Third, fares are falling. O\u2019Leary estimates that the European short-haul market expanded by 8% last year, which looks a case of too much, too soon. Ryanair\u2019s own prices fell 3% in the first half of its financial year, and more of the same is expected in the second. This prophecy of doom for small rivals wasn\u2019t issued for its own sake. O\u2019Leary, after seeing Ryanair\u2019s shares slide by a third of their value in 12 months, wanted to remind investors that the airline he runs can withstand some financial pressure. That\u2019s true enough, of course. Post-tax profits fell 7% in the half to \u20ac1.2bn but Ryanair clearly has a strong balance sheet, firmer fuel hedges than most and an entrenched position in the market. The airline may even be able to pick up some loose pieces if and when third-tier rivals fail. Yet it\u2019s hard to escape the impression that O\u2019Leary prefers to talk only about issues he regards as safe. One of the big developments at Ryanair in recent months was the vote of almost one third against the re-election of the chairman, David Bonderman. That rebellion flowed from the suspicion that Ryanair\u2019s boardroom is weakly governed and that hard questions have not be asked about last year\u2019s rostering cock-ups and this year\u2019s strikes. Staff at most European airlines are unionised but few have made adoption look as difficult as Ryanair has made it seem. O\u2019Leary referred to \u201cnoise\u201d, by which he presumably meant the strikes and cancellations that contributed to this month\u2019s profits warning and the protest against Bonderman. He should know that a large number of shareholders perceive the quarrels to be more serious than that. By all means boast about the underlying corporate resilience. But, come on, by this stage investors expect more than belligerence. Dunkerton takes on role of argumentative founder A scrap between a departed founder and a buttoned-up board can provide years of entertainment, as easyJet\u2019s shareholders will remember. Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou fires off fewer missives from Monaco these days, but there was a time when he campaigned to unseat the chairman and disputed almost every purchase of a new plane. Julian Dunkerton left Superdry only in March this year but he\u2019s started promisingly in the role of argumentative founder who thinks his creation is being mismanaged. The retail chain is on \u201ccompletely wrong path\u201d after \u201cprobably the most disastrous eight months you could imagine\u201d, he told the Sunday Times at the weekend. If Dunkerton were referring only to the share price, the period since his exit does indeed look a catastrophe. Superdry\u2019s stock market value has more than halved. Indeed, at 732p, the shares are as low as they\u2019ve been since late-2014 when Dunkerton gave up the job of chief executive to became product and brand director. Yet more has happened to Superdry than just the founder\u2019s departure. The retail fashion market is plainly weak and, as the company freely admits, the range of products is too concentrated on jackets and hoodies. The latter explains the effort to diversify into womenswear, denim and sportswear. But, if that is what Dunkerton means by the \u201cwrong path,\u201d he may struggle to win independent converts. Aberdeen Standard Life, which holds a 10% stake, describes itself as \u201ca supportive shareholder that supports the board and management in their strategy to improve the business performance.\u201d Dunkerton owns 18.5%, even after selling a quarter of his stake in July, so he has more voting clout if it ever gets that far. But, if he wants to pursue this dispute, he\u2019ll have to put an alternative strategy on the table, argue for it in detail and explain why he chose to leave rather than fight for his vision from within the boardroom. In the absence of a public plan, his comments read more like a simple cry of pain at the share price.",

      "bodyText": "And finally, European stock markets have ended the day in the red. The early optimism, following China\u2019s best day in a couple of years, burned off by the close of trading. The FTSE 100 ended 7 points lower at 7,042, a drop of just 0.1%. But Italy shed 0.6%, as traders braced for the EU to demand a budget rewrite tomorrow. Giuseppe Conte\u2019s pledge to avoid an Italexit wasn\u2019t enough to spark a rally. France also lost 0.6%, while Spain was down almost 1%. Over in New York, the Dow Jones industrial average has lost 131 points by lunchtime, a drop of 0.5%. However the Nasdaq tech index is up almost 0.4%. That\u2019s probably all for today. Goodnight! GW The pound is still suffering the Brexit blues, down almost one cent tonight. Sterling held onto its losses, as prime minister Theresa May urged MPs to hold their nerve, as 95% of the deal with the EU was in place. The news that her DUP partners might rebel over the remaining 5%, though, has worried the City. Ricardo Evangelista, senior analyst at ActivTrades, says: The Pound is down 0.8% on the day, dropping below the $1.30 psychological level for the first time since early October, following news that the Democratic Unionist Party, a key partner in parliament to the government of PM Theresa May, will back a proposal by rebel Tory MP\u2019s to legislate in order to block an eventual post-Brexit Irish border back-stop agreement with the EU. The new development makes a no-deal Brexit scenario more likely and sterling is struggling to find support, as the markets move to price-in the new development. At least one European neighbour is agitating for the EU to reject Italy\u2019s budget, points out the Financial Times: Italy\u2019s budget policy was sharply criticised by Sebastian Kurz, Austria\u2019s chancellor, who said on Monday that Brussels should reject Rome\u2019s plans unless there was a rethink. \u201cAustria is not prepared to stand behind the debts of other states while those states are actively contributing to market uncertainty,\u201d said Mr Kurz. The EU \u201cmust show it has learnt from the Greek crisis\u201d, he said. Austria holds the EU\u2019s rotating presidency. Hartwig L\u00f6ger, Austria\u2019s finance minister, said Italy\u2019s populist debt policy would be \u201ctaking the EU hostage\u201d if Brussels did not act. Italy\u2019s refusal to change its budget plans for 2019 mean a clash with the EU later this week seems inevitable. Brussels is expected to tell Rome that its planned structural deficit is too large, and demand a rewrite. My colleage Angela Giuffrida watched Conte\u2019s press conference earlier, and explains: Italy refused to compromise on its economic targets, sending a letter to Brussels on Monday explaining why it will raise its deficit \u2013 the gap between government spending and income \u2013 to 2.4% of GDP. The prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, told reporters in Rome that the government was not being led by \u201ca bunch of hotheads\u201d and that the increased borrowing was needed to ensure that Italy\u2019s economy grows. Conte said the government, made up of a coalition of the anti-establishment Five Star Movement and the far-right League, would need \u20ac17bn (\u00a315bn) to fund election campaign promises including tax cuts, a universal basic income and pension reforms. \u201cWe studied this for a long time and concluded that if we had continued on the same road, Italy would have entered into a recession,\u201d Conte said. Investors are still jittery about Italy\u2019s budget, despite the government\u2019s attempts to calm the situation today. Dan Smith, Investment Analyst at Thomas Miller Investment, explains: With the Italian government taking an uncompromising stance to its budget thus far, the events this week could provide the litmus test for the European Commission\u2019s ability to police national budgets. It remains a tough balancing act for Brussels; push too hard and risk strengthening eurosceptic sentiment in Italy, but too lenient a stance risks a counter reaction from other European members that comply with the rules. Investor sentiment around Italian assets has deteriorated in recent weeks and with debt rating agencies issuing downgrades (with more set to come), we are at a particularly precarious moment. The developments in Italy today have brought smiles to the faces of Greek officials across the Ionian sea. Italian prime minister Conte\u2019s pledge not to quit the eurozone was a reminder of the Greek crisis three years earlier. Market turmoil in Italy has hit Greek bank shares hard in recent weeks. The governor of the Bank of Greece, Yiannis Stournaras, blamed the dramatic drop in the share prices of Greek lenders to events in the neighbouring nation. Even worse for a country that has pinned its hopes on returning to international borrowing markets after exiting its third and final bailout programme in August, Greek bond yields have followed the trajectory of Italy bonds. This has highlighted Athens\u2019 continued, and acute, vulnerability to what Stournaras described as \u201cexogenous factors ... in Greece\u2019s neighbouring countries in particular.\u201d A senior Greek finance ministry official said: \u201cOur priority has been decoupling the situation there and here ... Greece is not Italy and should not be perceived as such abroad.\u201d The Wall Street rally is fizzling out too.. Not so fast! Italy\u2019s stock market has lost its early gains, sending the FTSE MIB down 0.6%. Bank shares are dropping -- perhaps investors are worrying about how much Italian government debt they own.... There\u2019s green on the boards as Wall Street opens: With the Chinese market surging by 4%, and Europe also higher, it\u2019s a positive start to the week. David Madden, analyst at CMC Markets, says the \u201cbullish sentiment\u201d from China has spilled over. Dealers are cautiously optimistic as questions still hang over Italy\u2019s financial health. Moody\u2019s have downgraded Italy\u2019s credit rating to one notch above junk status, but the agency lifted its outlook to stable from negative, so investors aren\u2019t afraid of another downgrade in the near-term. Just in, Supermarket group Wm Morrison has lost a legal battle against thousands of supermarket staff whose personal details were posted on the internet. Morrisons now faces a potentially \u201cvast\u201d compensation payout, after losing a court of appeal case today, Press Association says. The case was brought after the payroll data of around 100,000 employees was leaked on the internet, including names, addresses, and bank account details. This potentially exposed Morrisons staff to identity theft and fraud. Andrew Skelton, the internal auditor who leaked the information, was jailed for eight years in 2015. Wall Street is expected to follow Asia and Europe\u2019s lead by rising when trading begins in 25 minutes: Here\u2019s Bloomberg\u2019s latest take on Italy: Italy\u2019s populist government promised it won\u2019t let its budget deficit widen further than currently planned and called for dialogue with the European Union to address their differences. In a letter to the European Commission published Monday, Finance Minister Giovanni Tria said the government is ready to act to ensure it doesn\u2019t exceed the 2.4 percent target for 2019. He said he\u2019s aware that his spending plans don\u2019t comply with EU rules and he wants \u201cconstructive\u201d talks with officials in Brussels. Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, speaking in Rome, said the deficit target should be seen as an upper limit and it could still be narrower. The decision to increase spending was \u201cdifficult though necessary,\u201d Tria said in his letter. He cited slow economic growth and the \u201cdifficult economic situation the poorest segments of the Italian society are facing.\u201d Back in the City, the pound has dropped back below $1.30 for the first time in over two weeks. It\u2019s a fall of 0.65%, or nearly one cent. And that\u2019s because Theresa May has a fresh Brexit hurdle to struggle over. The DUP, who are propping the government up, are reportedly planning to block the Northern Ireland Brexit backstop.... In his Politics Live blog, Andy Sparrow says this isn\u2019t entirely shock (the DUP are opposed to anything that splits Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK), but it does ratchet up the pressure on Downing Street. Boom! Italy\u2019s prime minister has insisted that his country will not follow Britain out of the European Union. Harking back to George Bush (senior) 30 years ago, Giuseppe Conte told reporters in Rome to \u201cread my lips\u201d. Italy will not exit the eurozone despite the dispute over its budget plans, he declared. Reuters has more details: Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte defended on Monday Italy\u2019s 2019 budget, which has fallen foul of the European Commission, saying the failure of previous efforts to stimulate the economy meant a new approach was needed. In a wide-ranging news conference, Conte said he wanted constructive dialogue with the Commission over the contested fiscal package, and predicted that growth would \u201ctake off\u201d once government reforms were implemented. He pledged that next year\u2019s deficit would not exceed 2.4 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) and dismissed any suggestion that Italy might have to abandon the euro currency or leave the European Union. The \u2018read my lips\u2019 pledge may be a hostage to fortune, though. Bush famously promised not to impose new taxes before winning the presidential election in 1988, but later agreed to a budget which raised taxes after the US deficit widened. That u-turn was roasted in the media - the front page of the New York Post declared \u201cRead my lips... I lied!\u201d. It probably helped to cost Bush the 1992 election to Bill Clinton. Economics students at Liverpool University are studying the Italian situation today, and make an important point. Italy may be relieved to still have an \u2018investment-grade\u2019 credit rating, but that doesn\u2019t remove the dangerous feedback loop between the banking sector and the government... They say: Moody\u2019s decision to downgrade Italy to one level above junk status has, so far, not triggered panic. In fact, Italy\u2019s borrowing costs wend down. There is a good reason for this. Investors are relieved to see Italy avoiding a junk status because Moody\u2019s is considered more conservative (in the sense that it gives more inferior ratings) than other Rating Agencies. Since Moody\u2019s has not relegated Italy to junk status, it is more likely than not that other Rating Agencies won\u2019t push Italy to the \u2018junk abyss\u2019. On the negative side, however, the downgrade should serve as a (disturbing) reminder of the \u2018dangerous embrace\u2019 between Italy and its banks: Italian government debt accounts for as much as 19% of the assets of Italian banks, compared with 12% exposure of Portuguese banks to domestic debt and (only) 6.4% exposure of Greek banks to domestic debt. So any further stress to Italian yields will be transmitted immediately to Italian banks which will then increase the risk of severe contagion effects to Eurozone\u2019s periphery... And here\u2019s the third-year class, who are studying Financial Crises and Defaults, with professor Costas Milas: Giuseppe Conte has told reporters in Italy that growth will \u201ctake off\u201d once his government\u2019s tax and spending plans are implemented [unless Brussels demands a rewrite...]. Defending the deficit plans, the PM says that this extra borrowing will be used to fund investments. Technically, the budget includes the cost of various election campaign promises made by the two parties who form Italy\u2019s new coalition - including a universal basic income, tax cuts and pension reforms. But there\u2019s little argument that Italy does need a growth spurt, having underperformed its rivals since the financial crisis. Prime minister Conte has also promised that Italy certainly won\u2019t run a deficit over 2.4% of GDP next year. It might even be lower.... Just in: Italy is attempted to calm the dispute with the European Commission over its tax and spending plans. In a letter to the EC, economy minister Giovanni Tria says the Italian government is \u201cconscious\u201d that its 2019 budget isn\u2019t in line with Europe\u2019s stability pact, because its structural deficit [2.4%] will exceed the EU target [2%]. This is a \u201chard but necessary\u201d decision, he says, showing that Rome is sticking to its plans. But...in a bid to ease the EC\u2019s collective blood pressure, Tria says Italy doesn\u2019t intent to swell its structural deficit any further in 2020 and 2021, and pledged to hold \u201cconstructive and loyal dialogue\u201d with Brussels. Significantly, Tria also promises to take \u201call necessary measures\u201d if Italy\u2019s debt and deficit levels don\u2019t hit Rome\u2019s targets [the 2019 budget is based on some rather optimistic growth forecasts] The letter also reiterates the Italy is committed to remaining in the eurozone, and doesn\u2019t want to put financial stability at risk. Prime minister Giuseppe Conte is also defending the budget: Sterling has lost ground this morning, as the UK government limbers up for yet another crunch week for Brexit. The weekend papers were full of warnings that Theresa May has just days to save her premiership (something of a recurring theme for the embattled PM, of course). She\u2019s no closer to finding a Brexit deal that can win the support of her cabinet, let alone the UK parliament. The tone of the debate continues to plumb the depths, with one unnamed MP claiming that May should \u2018bring her own noose\u2019 to a meeting of backbench MPs this week. Rightly, that has caused outrage in Westminster. May is expected to tell the House of Commons today that the Brexit deal is 95% agreed. Unfortunately for her, that 5% include the Irish backstop, which is threatening to blow the faultlines in the cabinet wide open. And Brexit, like an aircraft, won\u2019t fly if it\u2019s only 95% complete. So traders are piling out of the pound, sending it down half a cent to $1.302. Just in: Germany\u2019s central bank has warned that the country\u2019s economy has endured a rough quarter. The Bundesbank believes that growth may have stalled in the last three months, partly due to lower car production as auto makers struggle to embrace tough new emission tests. In its monthly report on the German economy, it says: Although the economic upswing in Germany is essentially still intact, it may have come to a temporary halt in the third quarter of 2018. According to the Bundesbank\u2019s latest Monthly Report, this was mainly due to a substantial fall in production by car manufacturers. Europe\u2019s new motor vehicle emissions certification system was brought in after the Volkswagen test-rigging scandal. Some manufacturers have hit serious problems meeting the new rules, forcing them to suspend production of some models while they get certified (a bottleneck at the testers hasn\u2019t helped either). Those Chinese stimulus hopes are also pushing commodity prices up this morning. Copper has jumped to a one-week high, after president Xi tried to reassure China\u2019s companies that he was behind them. Reuters has the details: Benchmark copper on the London Metal Exchange was up 1.2% at $6,292 a tonne. \u201cThe news from China is encouraging for metals,\u201d said Eugen Weinberg, analyst at Commerzbank. \u201cMeasures that add liquidity will help in the short to medium term, but it won\u2019t solve the problem of indebtedness, a problem for some years now.\u201d Italian government bonds are strengthening this morning, on hopes that a full-blown battle with Brussels can be avoided. Deputy prime minister Luigi Di Maio, who leads the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement, has insisted today that his government will not leave the euro. It is expected to publish a letter later today, outlining its response to the EU\u2019s concerns over its 2019 budget. Rome is sticking to its plan to run a deficit of 2.4% of GDP next year, breaching the EU\u2019s budget rules. But the markets don\u2019t seem worried that Moody\u2019s downgraded Italy last week to Baa3, one notch above Junk. There is some relief that Italy still has an investment-grade rating - just!. So Italian bond prices are rising, pulling down the interest rate (or yield) on its debt. Many analysts expect the EU will instruct Rome to redraw its budget, with a smaller deficit. Commissioner Pierre Moscovici argued today that Italy must stick to EU rules, saying: \u201cWhen you are an EU member and a member of the single currency, of the euro zone, you must respect a number of joint rules. Yes, that\u2019s the same Moscovici who ran the French finance ministry when France, errr, overshot EU budget targets. More airlines are likely to collapse in the next few months, as the rising oil price hits earnings. So claims Ryanair\u2019s Michael O\u2019Leary this morning, as he reported a 7% drop in profits in the last six months. O\u2019Leary told Bloomberg TV that \u201cthe doo-doo has hit the fan\u201d recently, with crude prices having risen from $57 per barrel to over $80 in the last year. Rising fuel costs have dragged down Cypriot carrier Cobalt last week, the Danish carrier Primera Air and the Swiss airline SkyWork in the last two months. O\u2019Leary admitted that \u201cfrankly\u201d he hopes more rivals will disappear this winter, adding that Ryanair is better hedged against rising oil prices. On Brexit, O\u2019Leary predicted that Britain will avoid a no-deal hard Brexit, by agreeing a 21-month transition programme. In a \u201cworse-case\u201d scenario, UK airlines might be blocked from landing in the EU in the days immediately after Brexit, he added. But that prospect of seeing planes grounded would force the UK to \u2018stumble\u2019 into a transition deal, otherwise the government would fall, he predicted. Donald Trump\u2019s trade war, and the wider economic slowdown in China, are creating a real headache for policymakers. While a stimulus package might boost growth, it could also undermine Beijing\u2019s attempts to limit risky borrowing and \u2018deleverage\u2019 the economy. This is creating a lot of anxiety among the Chinese leadership, according to Xu Jianwei, senior China economist at French bank Natixis. He says (via the South China Morning Post): \u201cOne of Beijing\u2019s top priorities for this year was deleveraging, but that policy has shifted gradually because there are more serious problems. \u201cIf deleveraging continues, many Chinese companies may die in the process. But if deleveraging slows down, the financial risks will continue to pile up. So regulators are for sure very worried, and I don\u2019t think they have found a particularly good way out of it.\u201d European stock markets have begun the new week with small gains, helped by the rally in China. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 is 10 points highers, while Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB has jumped by almost 1%. China\u2019s stock market has closed for the day, with its biggest surge in three years. The CSI300 index ended the day 4.3% higher at 3,270, its biggest rise in almost three years, thanks to the flurry of reassuring noises from Chinese politicians and officials. The Shanghai Composite index, another benchmark, leapt by 4.1% - its biggest one-day gain since March 2016. President Xi Jinping pledge to always support private firms helped fuel the rally, says Yang Hai, an analyst at Kaiyuan Securities, who believes the market will rebound further - especially with tax cuts on the horizon. The Chinese government\u2019s \u201cverbal support for the economy and markets\u201d has created a risk-friendly mood to start the week, says Kit Juckes of Societe Generale: Reassurance from the Chinese leadership that they will support the economy have triggered the biggest one-day increase in equity indices since 2015 and has given markets everywhere a risk-friendly bias to start the week. A top Chinese central bank official has hinted that Beijing could unleash hefty tax cuts to keep its economy on the road. Ma Jun, advisor to the People\u2019s Bank of China, declared that tax cuts in 2019 could be worth over 1% of gross domestic product (GDP). Ma also declared that the Chinese financial sector would support businesses -- backing up presidents\u2019 Xi\u2019s pledge. He said PBOC would encourage banks not to discriminate against private firms, in favour of state-owned ones. The government will also roll out a guarantee fund to support private enterprises, he added. Craig Erlam of foreign exchange firm OANDA says Chinese traders have welcomed Beijing\u2019s pledge to protect the corporate sector: President Xi added his name to the list of those vowing to support private firms over the weekend, giving investors reason to pile back in to battered Chinese stocks. The Shanghai Composite had fallen more than 30% from its peak this year prior to Friday\u2019s comments, which has been the clearest sign so far that tariffs are biting. The tariffs may not yet be taking their toll on the trade data but as long as the stock market continues to take a beating and growth stalls \u2013 as the data last week showed \u2013 Trump will be confident that the measures are effective and continue to threaten to double down until he wins concessions. There\u2019s still a long way to go in this particular trade spat it would seem. Every sector on the Chinese stock market has rallied hard today, thanks to president Xi\u2019s pledge to support businesses. Healthcare and technology stocks led the way: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. 2018 has been a grim year for China\u2019s investors, but perhaps things are finally looking up. The Chinese stock market has surged by over 4% today, on track for its best day since 2015, after President Xi Jinping vowed \u201cunwavering\u201d support for the country\u2019s private sector. In a clear hint that Beijing will do more to protect China\u2019s economy, Xi insisted that his government was standing behind its business leaders. In a letter to private entrepreneurs, the Communist leader pledged: \u201cAny words and practices that negate and weaken the private economy are wrong. Supporting the development of private enterprises is the Party Central Committee\u2019s consistent policy. Other Chinese officials have also been making supportive noises. On Saturday, vice premier Liu He held a meeting with top officials to discuss financial stability in the face of the trade war with America. He later said that China must move faster to implement measures to encourage the healthy development of the economy. These comments are seen as evidence that China could ease fiscal policy and cut taxes to support its economy, after seeing growth slow to its lowest rate in 10 years last week. Chinese investors have leapt into action, driving the blue chip CSI300 index up by over 4.3% in late trading. The Shanghai Composite index is up 4%, on track for its best day since March 2016. Other Asia-Pacific markets are also rallying, on hopes that a big Chinese stimulus package would support growth in the region. Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group says: Asian shares bounced higher on Monday, as Chinese stocks extended their rebound for a second straight session, pulling European futures higher in the process. Beijing\u2019s pledge of support for the economy is overshadowing geopolitical concerns over Saudi Arabia, Italy and Brexit. Also coming up today Italian stocks may be under pressure, after ratings agency Moody\u2019s downgraded Italy\u2019s credit rating on Friday night. On the upside, Moody\u2019s left Italy with a \u2018stable\u2019 rating, meaning another downgrade isn\u2019t imminent. The move came as Rome prepares to see its 2019 Budget rejected by the European Union for breaching borrowing targets. There\u2019s not much in the economic calendar, but budget airline Ryanair and diamond producer Petra Diamonds are reporting results.",

Delsie Gayle, who was the target of a tirade of abuse by a fellow passenger on flight FR015 from Barcelona to London Stansted, said: \u201cI was shocked, nobody ever said those words to me.\u201d Another passenger, David Lawrence, who filmed the incident on 15 October and posted it online, said he chose to publicise it to show the world what had happened. The footage shows a man shouting at Gayle, telling her to move seats, while her daughter tries to stand up to him, telling him her mother is disabled. The man can be heard saying: \u201cI don\u2019t care whether she\u2019s fucking disabled or not \u2013 if I tell her to get out, she gets out.\u201d He can be heard in the video calling the woman an \u201cugly black bastard\u201d. When Gayle remonstrates with him he shouts at her: \u201cDon\u2019t talk to me in a foreign language, you stupid ugly cow.\u201d Gayle, 77, moved from her seat, but the man was allowed to remain in his after the incident, which occurred before the flight took off. Describing her shock, Gayle told ITV News: \u201cI feel very low. He paid a fare to go on holiday, I\u2019ve paid mine, so why does he abuse me for that due to the colour of my skin? He do it with me and he gets away, he\u2019ll do it to somebody else.\u201d Speaking about the impact the incident has had on her, Gayle added: \u201cI feel really depressed about it. I go to my bed and say, \u2018what have I done?\u2019 I haven\u2019t done anything for you to attack me. Because of the colour of my skin I was abused like that?\u201d Gayle said she believed that if the situation had been reversed and she had attacked the man, the police would have been called. Of other passengers, who did not intervene, she said: \u201cAnd because I\u2019m black, I\u2019m sad to say that, they didn\u2019t want to get involved with me.\u201d She added she had had no contact with Ryanair, which has been criticised over its handling of the incident. Lawrence said it was a difficult decision to film rather than step in to intervene, but he had done so \u201cbecause of the power of social media today, and the importance of the public knowing that these incidents take place\u201d. He said he had been criticised as \u201cchildish\u201d by one passenger for filming. Describing himself as a \u201cchild of the Windrush generation\u201d, Lawrence said: \u201cFor many years a lot of the West Indian community have gone through these types of incidents in Britain, but have never been able to share it with the public or with the world. So I decided that I had the opportunity to film this, as difficult as it was,\u201d he told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. According to the woman\u2019s 53-year-old daughter, the argument started because her mother, who was returning from a holiday designed to cheer her up on the one-year anniversary of her husband\u2019s death, has arthritis and took some time to move out of the way so the man could reach the window seat. Lawrence said he expected more from Ryanair, and he had previously seen people escorted off planes for less. Criticising the lack of response from cabin crew and other passengers, Lawrence said: \u201cOne passenger actually said to me, don\u2019t I think it was quite childish me filming the incident.\u201d The transport secretary, Chris Grayling, described the incident as \u201ctotally unacceptable\u201d and told the Today programme he hoped \u201cpolice would want to take action in such an extraordinarily unacceptable case\u201d. However, the shadow transport minister Karl Turner said he understood that Ryanair\u2019s failure to immediately remove the man from the flight and hand him over to the Spanish authorities could result in no charges being brought. Because Ryanair is registered in Dublin and the plane was on the ground in Spain, UK law did not apply, Turner told BBC Radio 4\u2019s World at One. There was no extradition arrangement for an offence of this nature, he said, so there might be no charges unless the man handed himself over to the Spanish authorities. \u201cI doubt whether he\u2019s going to do that,\u201d Turner said. Ryanair tweeted on Sunday that it had reported the matter to Essex police. \u201cAs this is now a police matter, we cannot comment further.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "One common criticism of the monthly unemployment figures is that they don\u2019t take into account the level of workers wanting more hours. The ABS has addressed this issue, and from now on along with the monthly unemployment rate we will get a monthly underemployment rate. This will enable us to better track problems in the economy and perhaps get a better sense of when our wages might start to grow faster. Until now the ABS has only had underemployment measured in trend and seasonally adjusted terms every quarter. But since July 2014 the ABS had been measuring underemployment on a monthly basis, and it now finally has enough data to be able to calculate seasonal affects. Thus from now on we will get a monthly figure. This is a fantastic development that is rather remarkable in light of the very significant cuts to the ABS funding over the past five years. It should reduce the criticism of the ABS that it misses out on many \u201creal\u201d unemployed because it counts being employed as working at least one hour a week. As I have noted in the past, the proportion of people working small number of hours a week has actually shrunk over the past 15 years, but nonetheless, people do still like to suggest that somehow the figures are illegitimate. Having a monthly underemployment rate will also increase the attention on that measure, which is certainly good given the large impact it has on wages and household income growth. In September, while the trend unemployment rate remained steady at 5.2% (but still as low as it has been since June 2012), the trend underemployment rate fell to 8.3% \u2013 the lowest it has been since August 2014, but still historically very high: Underemployment is a measure of those who are employed but who would wish for more hours. Mostly this is part-time workers, but it can include full-time workers who for whatever reason have in the past month not had as many hours as they would usually expect. It is worth noting that being an underemployed part-time worker does not necessarily mean you want to work full-time. The median extra hours work desired by those who work 1-9 hours a week, for example, is just 12. The simple explanation for our current high level of underemployment is that we have a lot more people working part-time than in the past, and therefore it only serves to reason that we would have more underemployed. And yet there is more to it than that. One big difference is that now more part-time workers want to work more hours than they did in the past. At the start of this century, 25% of male and 16% of women part-time workers wanted more hours; now it is 33% and 23% respectively: But this in itself is not a problem, for as I have previously noted underemployment and unemployment usually moved in sync, and then in 2014 they stopped doing so. Consider that the trend unemployment rate is the same now as it was in November 2004 but the underemployment rate is 1.5% points higher: Indeed the gap which the underemployment rate is above the unemployment rate is now larger than it has ever been: The question is why, and who is affected? This latest lot of new data allows us to break the data down by gender and age. Women, by virtue of being employed part-time in greater numbers, have always had a higher level of underemployment than men. In fact, for most of this century, the level of male unemployment and underemployment was nearly identical. But then in 2014 they split: But this does not mean the divergence between the two measures is all due to men, women too saw their unemployment rates fall from the end of 2014 while their level of underemployment remains steady: One issue is clearly age. Younger workers are much more likely to be underemployed \u2013 even more than they are likely to be either unemployed or employed part-time: This suggests that young people are much less likely to work part-time because they want to than because it is the only work they can get. But this again would not be much of concern if the underemployment of younger workers moved in sync with their unemployment. And yet it is clear from the data that this is not so. The unemployment rate for 15-24 year olds is now 11.2%, the lowest since the middle of 2011. But the underemployment rate is at 18.1% \u2013 just below the record high of 18.3%: And while it perhaps might not be surprising that younger workers are experiencing near record levels of underemployment, the big concern is that this is also the case for workers aged 25-44. Since the end of 2014, the unemployment rate for these workers has fallen 1.2% points, while their underemployment rate has gone down just 0.2% pts: Essentially there has been no escaping the underemployment boom. Yes, the youngest workers have certainly felt the effects more than the rest, but all ages and genders have seen underemployment either remain steady or fall much less than has the unemployment rate over the past four years. The deputy governor of the RBA, Guy Debelle, suggested in a speech last week that because the volume of underemployment (measured as a percentage of the desired hours worked over total potential hours in the labour force) has remained relatively flat, the unemployment rate remains the best measure of the labour market. But as we have seen, the strongest correlation at the moment with wages growth is underemployment, not unemployment: So while unemployment remains the big number everyone thinks of when it comes to the economy, the underemployment rate might actually be more important in terms of whether we will start seeing better wages growth. And with the rate now to come out every month, we can also expect it to begin garnering much more attention \u2013 by both the public and hopefully policy makers. \u2022 Greg Jericho is a Guardian Australia columnist",

Yes, the youngest workers have certainly felt the effects more than the rest, but all ages and genders have seen underemployment either remain steady or fall much less than has the unemployment rate over the past four years.</p> <p>The deputy governor of the RBA, Guy Debelle, <a href=\"https://www.rba.gov.au/speeches/2018/sp-dg-2018-10-17.html\">suggested in a speech</a> last week that because the volume of underemployment (measured as a percentage of the desired hours worked over total potential hours in the labour force) has remained relatively flat, the unemployment rate remains the best measure of the labour market.</p> <p>But as we have seen, the strongest correlation at the moment with wages growth is underemployment, not unemployment:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Wages growth &amp; underemployment 2003-2018\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/8GoK3/3/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2018/jun/19/with-unemployment-low-wages-will-start-growing-wont-they\">With unemployment low, wages will start growing \u2013 won't they? | Greg Jericho</a> </p> </aside>  <p>So while unemployment remains the big number everyone thinks of when it comes to the economy, the underemployment rate might actually be more important in terms of whether we will start seeing better wages growth.</p> <p>And with the rate now to come out every month, we can also expect it to begin garnering much more attention \u2013 by both the public and hopefully policy makers.</p> <p>\u2022 Greg Jericho is a Guardian Australia columnist</p>",

The ruling, which paves the way for 5,518 claimants to receive compensation, is the UK\u2019s first data protection class action. It comes after workers\u2019 personal details were leaked online by a senior IT employee, Andrew Skelton, in 2014. Information including salaries, national insurance numbers, dates of birth and bank account details were also sent to a number of newspapers. Skelton was jailed for eight years in July 2015 for his actions. The Bradford-based business is set to appeal against the court of appeal ruling, in a landmark case that could prompt companies to limit workers\u2019 access to data. The supermarket denied all legal liability and sought to reverse the high court\u2019s findings of vicarious liability. Nick McAleenan, a partner and data privacy law specialist at JMW Solicitors, who is representing the workers, said: \u201cThe jdges unanimously and robustly dismissed Morrisons\u2019 legal arguments. These shop and factory workers have held one of the UK\u2019s biggest organisations to account and won \u2013 and convincingly so. \u201cThe judgment is a wake-up call for business.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Vue, one of the world\u2019s largest cinema operators, has put plans to open dozens of film theatres in Saudi Arabia on hold as a result of the murder of Jamal Khashoggi. In February, British-headquartered Vue International signed an exclusive memorandum of understanding with the Abdulmohsin al-Hokair property group to jointly build up to 30 cinema sites. The deal was seen as groundbreaking, coming just months after the crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, lifted a 35-year ban on cinemas in Saudi Arabia. The agreement would have seen Vue, the largest movie exhibitor outside of the US and among the top five globally, be among the first to open cinemas in the country since the ban was lifted in December 2017. \u201cWe have delayed, but not pulled out,\u201d said Tim Richards, the chief executive and founder of Vue, speaking to the Guardian. \u201cWe are like a lot of leading companies around the world; we are watching and share the concerns that others do. This has all happened very quickly. We want to see what happens in the next few weeks and don\u2019t want to make any kneejerk reactions.\u201d Richards said he would also now no longer be attending a major economic forum in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday, dubbed \u201cDavos in the desert\u201d, and currently has no further trips planned. The kingdom also has a similar agreement in place with the US cinema operator AMC and Saudi Arabia\u2019s Public Investment Fund, which was announced in December. The position of AMC is not known. AMC hopes to open 40 cinemas in the next five years. Last week, it was reported that Endeavor, the media and entertainment group founded by Ari Emanuel, the Hollywood agent who was the inspiration behind Jeremy Piven\u2019s character in hit TV series Entourage, was attempting to terminate a $400m (\u00a3308m) investment by Saudi Arabia following the death of Khashoggi. In December, the Saudi government said it wanted to open 300 cinemas with more than 2,000 screens by 2030. Saudi Arabia banned cinemas in the 1980s, citing a possible threat to religious and cultural identity. The crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, rescinded the ban as part of his ambitious Vision 2030 plan to drive economic growth beyond a reliance on oil and effect cultural change. However, the Saudi cinemas would bear little resemblance to the shared experience that film fans in the west would be used to, with separate viewing areas for women with families and for single men. Saudi Arabia has estimated that developing a cinema industry could bring in more than 90 billion riyals (\u00a318m) to the economy and create 30,000 jobs. In December, the first films to be aired in Saudi Arabia following the lifting of the ban were a double bill of The Emoji Movie and Captain Underpants, using a projector in a state-run cultural centre. The first film to be shown in an actual movie theatre was the Hollywood superhero blockbuster Black Panther in April. On Monday Vue, which is chaired by the former ITV and Royal Mail boss Adam Crozier, made the biggest acquisition in its 15-year history with a \u20ac222m (\u00a3197m) deal to buy Germany\u2019s largest cinema chain, CineStar.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Premier Inn\u2019s owner, Whitbread, is launching a no-frills hotel chain with small pod-style rooms as the company seeks to refocus its business after the sale of its cafe chain Costa Coffee to Coca-Cola. Called Zip by Premier Inn, the new hotels will be located on the outskirts of major towns and cities. Rooms will cost from \u00a319 a night and be less than half the size of a standard Premier Inn room, at 8.5 square metres. Premier Inn prices typically start at \u00a349 while its more upmarket brand, hub, starts at \u00a369 a night. Premier Inn is Britain\u2019s biggest budget-hotel chain. Whitbread\u2019s chief executive, Alison Brittain, said the spin-off would cater for the \u201cultra-price-sensitive customer looking to zip in and out\u201d. The Zip rooms have been created by PriestmanGoode, the design consultancy behind first-class cabins for Air France, Lufthansa and Swiss airlines. The rooms feature lightboxes, en suite power showers, 24-inch televisions and twin single beds that can be pushed together to create a double. The first Zip hotel, with 138 rooms, will open in the Roath district of Cardiff early next year. Whitbread has secured a second site in Southampton, where 140 rooms are planned. Zip hotels will have communal areas that serve breakfast from \u00a33.95 and transform into a bar in the evenings, and there will be an ironing room on every floor. Similar to no-frills airlines, there will be other optional paid-for extras. Rooms are not cleaned daily but additional cleaning can be purchased for \u00a35 per day; wifi is free, although fast wifi costs \u00a35 for 24 hours. The company has nearly 800 Premier Inn hotels, including some in Germany and the Middle East. It has 10 hubs \u2013 seven in London and three in Edinburgh. Whitbread sold its Costa chain for \u00a33.9bn to Coca-Cola in August to focus on hotels. Five years ago, Whitbread launched hub by Premier Inn hotels \u2013 boutique-style hotels located in city centres, where rooms feature bespoke Hypnos beds, a choice of pillows, monsoon showers and 40-inch TVs. In recent years, Premier Inn and Travelodge, the UK\u2019s other big budget-hotel chain, have invested in custom-made kingsize beds and power showers, and moved upmarket to try to lure business travellers. Analysts at Bernstein said: \u201cWe wonder whether the introduction of a budget brands sitting below the core Premier Inn offer is a route to increase rates at Premier Inn by improving hotel technology and rate management.\u201d Premier Inn\u2019s managing director, Simon Jones, said: \u201cWe have undertaken considerable research, including having had six Zip rooms on sale to customers for many months. It\u2019s clear through the research that people want the basics done brilliantly, such as a comfy bed and a power shower, but they are happy to compromise on location or some extras if they are paying a fantastic price for their room.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Profits at Dr Martens have increased by a third as the Northamptonshire-based boot brand got a kick from a 90s fashion revival. The rise was led by a surge in demand across Europe, where the company opened 16 new stores, taking its total worldwide to 94. Underlying profits rose to \u00a350m in the year to March as sales increased by a fifth to \u00a3348.6m. The boot designed for workers has been championed by fashion influencers from Bella and Gigi Hadid to Cardi B and Miley Cyrus, as well as teenagers wanting to put their own spin on styles their parents once wore. While the company has been experimenting with collaborations with trendy labels such as Lazy Oaf and BAPE, sales of its 1460 boot and 1461 shoe led growth, with sales up 29% over the last year to represent 55% of total revenues. Dr Martens first set trends when it was adopted by skinheads, a 60s youth subculture whose style expressed working-class solidarity. Since then, various fashion tribes from mods to 90s Britpop kids have embraced the thick-soled footwear. Paul Mason, the brand\u2019s chair, said: \u201cWe\u2019ve delivered another set of strong results with broad-based growth across all regions and channels and double-digit revenue and ebitda [pre-tax earnings] performances. \u201cThis, in the context of the wider macroeconomic uncertainty that exists in a few of our key markets, is testament to both the strength of our brand, our heritage and consumer proposition and the execution of our strategy.\u201d He said Dr Martens had \u201csignificant scope for growth\u201d via new stores and its website, through which sales rose 35% to nearly \u00a344m in the past year. Founded in 1960, the brand was owned by the Northamptonshire-based Griggs family, who sold a majority stake to the private equity firm Permira in a \u00a3300m deal in 2014. In the early noughties, when clumpy footwear fell out of fashion, Dr Martens struggled for survival. In 2000, the company moved production to China and Thailand. Seven years later, the Griggs family reopened the brand\u2019s original factory in Wollaston, Northamptonshire, to revive its iconic vintage styles. And this year, Dr Martens poached the former Cath Kidston and Levi\u2019s executive Kenny Wilson to take the helm.",

    "webTitle": "Ryanair profits fall as CEO predicts grim winter for aviation", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Ryanair chief executive, Michael O\u2019Leary, has said he expects more airlines to go bust, as the budget carrier posted a 7% drop in profits because of rising fuel prices and strikes hitting costs and bookings. O\u2019Leary predicted a grim winter for the aviation industry, with oil prices, interest rates and the US dollar rising and air fares falling. He said Ryanair was better hedged than most rivals against the rise in oil prices, adding: \u201cIt is inevitable that more of the weaker, unhedged European airlines will fold this winter.\u201d Several smaller airlines have collapsed in recent weeks, including the Cypriot carrier Cobalt last week, the Danish carrier Primera Air and the Swiss airline SkyWork. The UK regional airline Flybe warned of mounting annual losses last week, blaming weaker consumer demand and higher fuel prices. Larger airlines were not immune to this, with many closing bases and cutting routes to minimise winter losses, Ryanair noted. The Irish carrier, Europe\u2019s biggest budget airline, reported a fall in net profits to \u20ac1.2bn (\u00a31.1bn) in the six months to 30 September, with its average fare down 3% to less than \u20ac46. Revenues rose 8% to \u20ac4.8bn. However, costs rose by 7% excluding fuel, after 20% pay increases for pilots and additional costs for staff training and cancellations and delays caused by air traffic control strikes. Ryanair\u2019s share price was up 5% at lunchtime on Monday. The company cut its forecast for full-year profits by 12% last month. It has been hit by a wave of strikes by pilots and cabin crew across Europe, which caused a spike in cancellations of higher-fare weekend flights and pushed up passenger compensation costs. Ryanair said 2018 would be the worst year on record for European air traffic control strikes. O\u2019Leary told Bloomberg TV that if the UK crashed out of the European Union without a deal next April \u201cflights would be grounded \u2026 [and] the government would fall\u201d. However, while the risk of a no-deal Brexit was rising, he thought it was still unlikely and said a 21-month transition period to December 2020 was the most likely scenario. He also said if the board wanted him to stay as chief executive for another two to three years he would do so, but he would not stay for another five years. John Strickland, an aviation consultant, said Ryanair was going through a period of significant change, describing the airline\u2019s acceptance of pilots\u2019 unions last December for the first time in its 32-year history as a \u201cmassive change in their culture\u201d. He said the decision to use the chief operating officer, Peter Bellew, as the lead negotiator with the unions, rather than the outspoken O\u2019Leary, signalled a \u201cless combative, more human approach\u201d. O\u2019Leary added on Monday that the airline hoped to reach deals with all its major unions by Christmas. \u201cGiven the adverse environment that\u2019s out there for airlines and the number of job losses being reported in recent weeks both by pilots and cabin crew, there is a much more sensible, common sense approach being taken by the unions,\u201d he said. O\u2019Leary said that recent progress in talks left Germany and Belgium as the only two large markets for the airline where recognition agreements had not been secured. However, John Moore, the head of industrial relations at the British Airline Pilots\u2019 Association, said this month \u201cthings will only improve if there is regime change\u201d at the top. Neil Wilson, the chief market analyst at Markets.com, said: \u201cAirlines are generally facing serious headwinds from a stronger dollar, higher oil prices and rising interest rates. Ryanair is less critically exposed to all of those but the strikes and unionisation are dragging it into the mire. The key question is whether management can sort out strikes before customers completely lose faith.\u201d Ryanair is facing calls for a boycott on Twitter after a racist incident on one of its flights, which it has referred to Essex police. The airline faces criticism that it did little to prevent a male passenger from inflicting a tirade of racist abuse on a 77-year-old woman. Ryanair apparently did not remove the passenger from the flight from Barcelona, instead moving the woman from her seat. Ryanair said: \u201cWe have reported this to the police in Essex and as this is now a police matter we cannot comment further.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 23 October 2018. Ryanair\u2019s half-year revenues figure was \u20ac4.8bn, not \u20ac4.4bn as an earlier version said. In addition, the article has been amended to clarify that compensation costs related to payments made to passengers for flight cancellations and delays.",

The key question is whether management can sort out strikes before customers completely lose faith.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Guardian business email sign-up\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for\u00a0Business\u00a0Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ryanair is facing calls for a boycott on Twitter after a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/oct/21/ryanair-refers-racist-incident-to-police-amid-criticism-over-inaction\">racist incident on one of its flights</a>, which it has referred to Essex police.</p> <p>The airline faces criticism that it did little to prevent a male passenger from inflicting a tirade of racist abuse on a 77-year-old woman. Ryanair apparently did not remove the passenger from the flight from Barcelona, instead moving the woman from her seat.</p> <p>Ryanair said: \u201cWe have reported this to the police in Essex and as this is now a police matter we cannot comment further.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 23 October 2018. Ryanair\u2019s half-year revenues figure was \u20ac4.8bn, not \u20ac4.4bn as an earlier version said. In addition, the article has been amended to clarify that compensation costs related to payments made to passengers for flight cancellations and delays.</p>",
