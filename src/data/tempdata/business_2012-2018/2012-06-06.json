      "bodyText": "Sunnier weather in May prompted shoppers to splurge on ice cream, barbecue food and shorts, setting retailers' tills ringing. But despite a bounceback in retail sales last month, consumers remain cautious about spending on bigger items, the latest monthly snapshop from the British Retail Consortium shows. As wet and cold weather in the first half of the month gave way to warmer temperatures in the final week, shoppers celebrated the arrival of summer by spending more on food and drink, summer clothes, lawnmowers and garden furniture. UK retail sales climbed 1.3% from May 2011 on a like-for-like basis, although the improvement was not enough to offset April's 3.3% annual drop, according to the BRC. Total sales, including new shops, rose 3.4% last month against a 1% fall in April. While the first weeks of May saw people buying jeans and knitwear, many more were buying skirts, shorts, swimwear and sandals by the end of the month. Wedges were particularly popular while flat shoes and pumps also sold well thanks to promotions, which were more widespread than last year. Tight budgets meant that customers favoured value lines and plain styles which can be worn for work as well as leisure. Womenswear had its best growth so far this year and and children's clothes saw a double-digit uplift in sales, while garden centres enjoyed a surge in the number of people investing in gardening tools and new lawnmowers to tackle overgrown grass. Some retailers said April's downpours led to pent-up demand which was unleashed at the first sign of summer, with shoppers rushing to update their summer wardrobes. Electrical retailers benefited from the launch of the iPad 3 and new Kindle while television sales were boosted by the digital switchover. White goods sales were steady and often for replacement rather than upgrade, and many were promotion-driven at the expense of profit margins, especially for larger purchases. Stephen Robertson, BRC director general, said: \"Much of the month's positive performance can be attributed to spending in the final week when consumers responded enthusiastically to the sun coming out. The performance of food retailers was more consistent across the month. Retailers will be hoping the boost continues, sustained by this summer's celebrations and sporting events.\" Retailers have also been counting on a boost from the jubilee celebrations last weekend, which saw fruit, wine and garden products fly off the shelves. Experts reckon up to \u00a3823m could have been spent during the four-day celebrations, with supermarkets seen as the main winners. With the Euro 2012 football tournament kicking off on Friday, followed by the London Olympics in July, shops hope to capitalise on the feelgood factor to make up lost ground after a dismal spring. A lot hinges on the weather, though, which has taken a turn for the worse again. Helen Dickinson, head of retail at KPMG, said: \"Retailers are hoping that the Jubilee celebrations will have helped to pull out them of the mire, but a short-term patriotic spending spree will not overcome the underlying difficulties facing the industry - which remains under pressure from a combination of declining consumer confidence and squeezed incomes.\" Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at IHS Global Insight, agreed. \"Although consumer confidence improved in May, it is still extremely low compared to long-term norms, which is hardly surprising given that the UK is back in recession and there is major uncertainty over the situation in Greece/eurozone and how this could hit the UK.\"",

All the guff we are being fed about the need to \"free up capital\" is just so much hogwash. Please can we ditch for ever Friedman and all his works. Keynes was right. Get over it and go for it.<br><strong>Hazel Davies</strong><br><em>Notre Dame du Bec, France</em></p> <p>\u2022\u2008Although some of Keynes's ideas might still be right and Mr Krugman might have the right prescription for our economic problems, the world has moved on. There are no more monetary controls, there is no Glass-Steagall Act, there is no bank regulation. The world is awash with tax havens. Both wealthy individuals and corporations have taken advantage of globalisation to evade tax by transferring funds offshore, depriving nations of tax revenue.</p> <p>Countries with natural resources are still not benefiting from the rises in commodity and energy prices, as foreign companies reap the benefits. Economic power is shifting away from the west towards Asia. The wealth gap has widened to unsustainable proportions, as boardroom directors pillage corporate funds. Individual nations have no control or power any more, while Europe has too many captains on the bridge arguing over how to steer the vessel. So unless there is a co-ordinated effort by western governments to take over the reins of the financial and corporate sector to redistribute wealth on a massive scale and restore more justice and equality, there can be no long-term solution \u2013 just a greater risk of social disorder.<br><strong>Peter Fieldman</strong><br><em>Madrid, Spain</em></p> <p>\u2022\u2008Paul Krugman's analysis of the failure of policymakers to address effectively the current financial crisis and ongoing economic recession is sadly correct. He rightly condemns the policy of quantitative easing as useless and a victim of the liquidity trap. QE keeps banks liquid and allows politicians to claim that they are \"doing something\", but does little for the real economy.</p> <p>For Krugman's policy of fiscal reflation to work requires that the influential advocates of the \"casino\" model be converted to the merits of regulated capitalism. In addition, other fundamental economic issues need to be addressed. First, \"free\" markets need to be regulated to ensure prices reflect the true costs of production \u2013 this means extensive use of taxes and subsidies, and international agreement about them. Second, international terms of trade need wholesale reform, with regulated exchange rates that reflect purchasing power parity. In addition, saving the euro would require intra-euro-area exchange rates as well. Third, sovereign-bond financing should move largely to undated debt. For this to work effectively would also require extensive international agreement.</p> <p>Without addressing these fundamental issues, \"Keynesianism in one country\" is doomed to failure.<br><strong>Philip Robins</strong><br><em>Addingham, West Yorkshire</em></p> <p>\u2022\u2008One way of kickstarting the economy, as espoused by Professor Krugman, would be to embark on a massive programme of what they used to call \"council houses\". At least a million homes are needed, and building them would not only kickstart the economy but would provide homes for the poorest, and reduce the enormous drain on housing benefit that worries Cameron so.<br><strong>Sid Hollands</strong><br><em>Maidstone, Kent</em></p> <p>\u2022\u2008Three things have been puzzling me: the increasingly loud noises about social mobility; the belief that nobody saw the economic crash coming; and the government's claim that there is no alternative to austerity. Then it hit me that they are all based on false premises. The problem is not social mobility at all; it is the obscene economic gap between the top and the bottom. Close the gap and social mobility becomes less important. If I, with nothing better than A-level economics, saw the recession coming some years before it hit us, it beggars belief that the financially more astute didn't see it as well.</p> <p>And as for deficit-slashing austerity, what better smokescreen could the Tories have for reducing the size of the public sector, something they have wanted to do since the Attlee government lost the 1951 general election, but&#xa0;never had the brass neck to attempt&#xa0;before?<br><strong>Alan Healey</strong><br><em>Milson, Shropshire</em></p>",

Economic power is shifting away from the west towards Asia. The wealth gap has widened to unsustainable proportions, as boardroom directors pillage corporate funds. Individual nations have no control or power any more, while Europe has too many captains on the bridge arguing over how to steer the vessel. So unless there is a co-ordinated effort by western governments to take over the reins of the financial and corporate sector to redistribute wealth on a massive scale and restore more justice and equality, there can be no long-term solution \u2013 just a greater risk of social disorder. Peter Fieldman Madrid, Spain \u2022\u2008Paul Krugman's analysis of the failure of policymakers to address effectively the current financial crisis and ongoing economic recession is sadly correct. He rightly condemns the policy of quantitative easing as useless and a victim of the liquidity trap. QE keeps banks liquid and allows politicians to claim that they are \"doing something\", but does little for the real economy. For Krugman's policy of fiscal reflation to work requires that the influential advocates of the \"casino\" model be converted to the merits of regulated capitalism. In addition, other fundamental economic issues need to be addressed. First, \"free\" markets need to be regulated to ensure prices reflect the true costs of production \u2013 this means extensive use of taxes and subsidies, and international agreement about them. Second, international terms of trade need wholesale reform, with regulated exchange rates that reflect purchasing power parity. In addition, saving the euro would require intra-euro-area exchange rates as well. Third, sovereign-bond financing should move largely to undated debt. For this to work effectively would also require extensive international agreement. Without addressing these fundamental issues, \"Keynesianism in one country\" is doomed to failure. Philip Robins Addingham, West Yorkshire \u2022\u2008One way of kickstarting the economy, as espoused by Professor Krugman, would be to embark on a massive programme of what they used to call \"council houses\". At least a million homes are needed, and building them would not only kickstart the economy but would provide homes for the poorest, and reduce the enormous drain on housing benefit that worries Cameron so. Sid Hollands Maidstone, Kent \u2022\u2008Three things have been puzzling me: the increasingly loud noises about social mobility; the belief that nobody saw the economic crash coming; and the government's claim that there is no alternative to austerity. Then it hit me that they are all based on false premises. The problem is not social mobility at all; it is the obscene economic gap between the top and the bottom. Close the gap and social mobility becomes less important. If I, with nothing better than A-level economics, saw the recession coming some years before it hit us, it beggars belief that the financially more astute didn't see it as well. And as for deficit-slashing austerity, what better smokescreen could the Tories have for reducing the size of the public sector, something they have wanted to do since the Attlee government lost the 1951 general election, but never had the brass neck to attempt before?

      "bodyText": "The talk at the bar was of a new golden age for the scotch whisky industry after the drinks giant Diageo unveiled plans to pour more than \u00a31bn into building new distilleries and extra stills as it cranks up production to slake the world's growing thirst. Whisky producers are turning the taps on as drinkers thousands of miles away in the botecos of Rio de Janeiro and Shanghai's upmarket watering holes knock back Scotland's national tipple with gusto. Last year, whisky exports broke through \u00a34bn, as the drink cemented its position as a status symbol for the growing middle classes of the emerging economies of China, south Asia and South America. Diageo, owner of Johnnie Walker and Bell's whiskies, said it was already scouting locations in Speyside \u2013 known as the whisky triangle because the rugged landscape is home to more than half of Scotland's distilleries \u2013 and the Highlands for the first of potentially three new malt distilleries. Diageo's boss, Paul Walsh, said the five-year investment marked a pivotal moment for its scotch whisky business, which he said had achieved \"remarkable, sustained global growth\" in recent years. \"Scotch is resonating with consumers from Boston to Beijing,\" he said. \"We expect that success to continue, particularly in high-growth markets.\" The decline of Scotland's industrial base has meant that, as with the shipyards and the mines, few Scots have been able to follow their fathers into the traditional trades related to whisky production. But Diageo said the plan would create 110 new jobs aimed at young people including apprentice coopers and coppersmiths. The building projects will create around 250 construction jobs each year and an estimated 500 jobs in the wider economy, the company said. The promise of new jobs marks a turning point for the industry, said Campbell Evans of the Scotch Whisky Association (SWA), because while many producers have been increasing production \u2013 including reopening mothballed distilleries \u2013 it has so far not particularly boosted employment. About 10,000 people, many in economically deprived parts of Scotland, are employed directly by the industry. \"The scotch whisky industry has been enjoying a renaissance for several years,\" said Evans. \"I hesitate to use the term 'golden age' but this investment takes us beyond renaissance.\" With annual sales of nearly \u00a310bn, Diageo owns a bar-full of drinks brands including Buchanan's, Smirnoff vodka, Baileys and Guinness. Half the pot of money is earmarked to build two distilleries and a new warehouse to store the maturing spirit. Although storm clouds hang over the global economy, drinks companies such as Diageo must try to predict the level of demand for blends such as Johnnie Walker, J&amp;B and Bells a decade from now.

Walsh said three sites had been identified for the first new distillery, including Inchgower and Glendullan in Speyside, and Teaninich slightly further north, while nearly half of its existing 28 malt distilleries were set to expand. The industry is riding high as a dram becomes the status drink of choice in countries such as Brazil, Russia and China. This year it is predicted more scotch will be consumed in emerging markets than in the developed world, for the first time.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Spain is warning that Europe's single currency will unravel unless its leaders decide within weeks to centralise budget and tax policies in the eurozone and agree on a strategy to pool responsibility for failing banks. As Spain's prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, came under mounting international pressure to accept the eurozone's fourth national bailout in two years, the government in Madrid angrily rejected the demands, insisting that it did not need rescuing. With fears of a euro meltdown having rapidly shifted from Greece to Spain, Rajoy is pleading for a direct eurozone rescue of his country's banks, to avoid the humiliation attached to requesting a national bailout. Sources familiar with the Spanish government's thinking said its negotiating position was that the fundamental quandary facing the eurozone was not Spain, but a European failure of leadership in persuading the financial markets that the euro would be defended at all costs. A Brussels summit at the end of the month would have to remedy that by agreeing to establish a eurozone banking and fiscal union \u2013 major federalising steps certain to be fought over. Without that commitment, Spain fears the single currency would be finished in months. The Spanish government believes that the eurozone's fourth-biggest economy is too big to rescue and that the consequences of abandoning Spain to the markets without a pledge of major European reform could be so ferocious that the single currency would not survive. The current rules governing eurozone bailouts stipulate that a government has to request help and that the money may only be channelled via governments \u2013 increasing the national debt burden. But Spain is stalling until key euro group meetings, the G20 summit and the Greek election later this month. Some analysts believe that if Spain is finally forced to request a full-scale EU/IMF bailout it is likely to come around 20 June. Sources in Brussels confirmed that a rescue plan was being hatched for Spain \u2013 but it could be limited to desperately-needed banking aid, rather than a full national bailout. Luis de Guindos, the Spanish finance minister, said his government would wait until the results of an independent audit of Spanish banks was completed later this month before pondering its options. The IMF is to deliver its verdict on the condition of the Spanish banks on Monday, followed a week later by the Spanish audit. \"From that basis, the Spanish government will decide what measures must be taken to recapitalise banks,\" said De Guindos. Madrid was joined by Washington and London in calling on the eurozone, principally Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, to deliver a persuasive new plan quickly for saving the euro. They fear the crisis might inflict immense damage on the US and UK economies. A big move towards reform could immediately ease market pressure on Spain's borrowing costs, though the European Central Bank might still have to supply some funding while details of the new union were thrashed out. Sources familiar with the Spanish government's thinking believe the country's banking crisis could be fixed much more cheaply than the \u20ac50bn bill currently estimated by analysts. In Brussels the signs are that a deal is being considered that would be more palatable for Rajoy by explicitly linking the rescue money to the banking problem and not to his government's stewardship of Spain's finances. As the ECB left eurozone interest rates unchanged at 1%, ignoring calls for a slight reduction, its head, Mario Draghi, dismissed the criticism from Washington and London \u2013 but he also urged eurozone leaders get their act together. Berlin is pushing the fiscal union, but on its own terms. It wants to force common rules and targets but avoid any early commitment to sharing liability for the debt or bank savings of individual countries. David Cameron is to go to Berlin on Thursdayto try to push Merkel into a more protective stance on the euro, which would entail German pledges to underwrite struggling countries' debt. Following a telephone conversation with Barack Obama, the British prime minister will tell Merkel the US and the UK are insisting on \"an immediate plan\" on the euro, Downing Street said. The prime minister will tell Merkel the eurozone has no more than weeks to act to shore up the single currency. Cameron's spokeswoman said the pair \"agreed on the need for an immediate plan to tackle the crisis and to restore market confidence\". Cameron's regular interventions from the sidelines of the euro crisis irritate Berlin and Brussels and Merkel is unlikely to be swayed, although Germany is showing some signs of greater flexibility. The White House, fearing the impact of a European disaster on Barack Obama's re-election campaign, is becoming more trenchant in its criticism of the eurozone and its demands of the Germans. In Brussels, the signs are that the sides were inching towards a deal that would be made more palatable for Rajoy by explicitly linking the rescue money solely to the banking problem - and not to his government's stewardship of Spain's public finances. German politicians dropped any pretence that they were not pressing Rajoy to ask for a bailout, but said the rescue could come without very tight strings attached. \"I do think that Spain has to come under the rescue shield,\" said Volker Kauder, the parliamentary leader of Merkel's Christian Democrats in Berlin. \"Not because of the country, but because of the banks.\" Tristan Cooper, sovereign credit analyst at Fidelity Worldwide Investment said: \"The willingness to support Spain is there. The difficulty is designing a method that can satisfy Germany and the market. Although sick banks are Spain's most acute ailment, there are more chronic ones. These include the highest unemployment and the third widest fiscal deficit in Europe in a deep recession. Markets would react positively to an adequate bank recap solution. A structural change in investor sentiment requires the prospect of a sustainable economic recovery and a credible plan for achieving it.\" The expectation is that any decisions will be delayed until after the Greek election on 17 June. Eurozone finance ministers are to meet on 21 June. The next day Rajoy is due in Rome for a summit with the leaders of Germany, France, and Italy before the Brussels summit a week later. If the result of this risky round of brinkmanship and bargaining is an agreed \"road-map\" towards the medium-term aim of a eurozone federation, the Spanish hope the heat will be off, pressure from the financial markets will subside, their borrowing costs will sink and recapitalising their banking sector will become more feasible.",

But while Gracie and his fellow officials at the Bank of England, bloodied by a string of banking rescues between 2007 and 2009, had the luxury of theorising, the European commission on Wednesday released its own proposals for a new \"banking union\" into the teeth of a full-blown funding crisis in the Spanish financial sector. And like many of the commission's blueprints of the past two years, this latest set of proposals raised more questions than it answered. For Britain, the main one is whether it wants to have any part of this plan, which the commission hopes would work across all 27 EU member-countries. Whitehall officials on Wednesday gave a positive response to the commission's enthusiasm for \"bail-ins\", a move requiring banks' shareholders and creditors to bear heavy losses before taxpayers are forced to get involved. But two other elements are likely to raise eyebrows at the Treasury. First, Brussels' new super-regulator will be able to parachute in a \"special manager\" to run troubled banks. That is unlikely to be popular in the UK, where the chancellor is carefully constructing a new supervisory regime focused on Threadneedle Street. Second, the commission moots the idea of \"intra-group support agreements\", under which banks with operations in several countries across the eurozone would be allowed to transfer resources from one part of the group to another in times of crisis. That is exactly the approach the FSA has refused to allow for Spain's Santander bank, insisting instead that it ringfence sufficient assets within its UK operations to ensure British savers are not put at risk. Britain has every interest in ensuring there is no repeat of the financial crisis; but it also wants to protect its own taxpayers. Given the deep-seated co-ordination problems between the Treasury, the Bank and FSA that dogged the rescue of Northern Rock and RBS, and the bungled attempts of euro-members to paper over the shaky state of their own financial sectors over the past five years, George Osborne is likely to be extremely reluctant to invite Brussels to join in the fraught negotiations the next time a British bank is on the rocks.",

      "bodyText": "Bank of England policymakers are under pressure to take action on Thursday to cushion the recession-hit UK economy against the turmoil in the eurozone. Most City analysts expect the Bank's nine-member monetary policy committee to leave interest rates on hold at their record low of 0.5%, and hold back from unleashing a new round of quantitative easing (QE). But the outlook has worsened markedly even since last month, when Bank governor Sir Mervyn King warned that the UK economy could not fail to be damaged by the fact that its main trading partner, the eurozone, was \"tearing itself apart\". The future of the single currency again appears in doubt this week, after Madrid conceded that it will need external help if it is to afford to rescue Spain's struggling banking sector, while polls from Greece suggest there is some chance that a new government could try to overturn the tough conditions of its bailout. In the UK, recent surveys of the manufacturing and construction sectors have shown confidence collapsing, suggesting events across the Channel may be starting to feed through to economic activity. Thursday's services sector PMI will also help to inform the committee's decision. David Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce, said, \"demands for more QE have started to rise due to the worsening crisis in the eurozone and signs that the US and Asian economies are slowing.\" He said that the BCC would like to see policymakers take a more innovative approach, of trying to unblock lending to businesses directly, instead of relying on QE to filter down through the economy. Some analysts, including George Buckley at Deutsche Bank, have also suggested the Bank could reduce interest rates for the first time in more than three years, as a clear sign that they are determined to do everything they can to shield the UK from collateral damage. The MPC decided to resume the controversial policy of QE - buying government bonds using electronically-created money - last October, amid signs that economic growth was slowing sharply, while strains in the eurozone banking system were threatening to spiral into a full-blown credit crunch. They increased the total budget for the programme to \u00a3275bn in October, and added another \u00a350bn in February, making \u00a3325bn in all. However, since then there has been no consensus on the committee that fresh action was needed, despite the news that the economy has slipped back into recession. Minutes of last month's MPC meeting showed just one member, David Miles, calling for a \u00a325bn extension of quantitative easing. However, two former supporters of renewed easing - US economist Adam Posen, and Martin Weale, of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, have recently made downbeat remarks about the health of the economy. Malcolm Barr, of JP Morgan, said he expected three votes for more QE at Thursday's meeting, with a majority building up by next month. Simon Wells, of HSBC, said, \"despite the bad news on growth over the past few weeks, we do not expect the MPC to announce more QE in June. But it is likely to be a close call.\"",

    "fields": {
      "standfirst": "<strong>Laura Tyson</strong>: Overlooking the evidence, European leaders, spearheaded by Germany, have misdiagnosed the problem as one of fiscal profligacy for which painful austerity is the only cure", 
      "body": "<p>Fiscal profligacy did not cause the sovereign debt crisis engulfing Europe, and fiscal austerity will not solve it. On the contrary, such austerity has aggravated the crisis and now threatens to bring down the euro and throw the global economy into another tailspin.</p> <p>In 2007, Spain and Ireland were models of fiscal rectitude, with far lower debt-to-GDP ratios than Germany had. Investors were not worried about default risk on Spanish or Irish sovereign debt, or about Italy's chronically large sovereign debt. Indeed, Italy boasted the lowest deficit-to-GDP ratio in the eurozone, and the Italian government had no problem refinancing at attractive interest rates. Even Greece, despite its rapidly eroding competitiveness and increasingly unsustainable fiscal path, could attract the capital that it needed.</p> <p>Deluded by the convergence of bond yields that followed the euro's launch, investors fed a decade-long private-sector credit boom in Europe's less developed periphery countries, and failed to recognize real-estate bubbles in Spain and Ireland, and Greece's slide into insolvency. When growth slowed sharply and credit flows collapsed in the wake of the Great Recession, budget revenues plummeted, governments were forced to socialise private-sector liabilities, and fiscal deficits and debt soared.</p> <p>With the exception of Greece, the deterioration in public finances was a symptom of the crisis, not its cause. Moreover, the deterioration was predictable: history shows that the real stock of government debt explodes in the wake of recessions caused by financial crises.</p> <p>Overlooking the evidence, European leaders, spearheaded by Germany, misdiagnosed the problem as one of fiscal profligacy for which painful austerity is the only cure. On this view, significant and rapid reductions in government deficits and debt are a precondition to restoring government credibility and investor confidence, stemming contagion, bringing down interest rates, and reviving economic growth.</p> <p>There is also a moral hazard aspect to the austerity argument: easing repayment terms for spendthrift governments will only encourage reckless behavior in the future \u2013 forgiving past sins perpetuates sinning. Moreover, virtuous creditors should not bail out irresponsible borrowers, be they private or public. From this perspective, austerity is the necessary and just penance for reprobates like Greece, Spain, and Italy.</p> <p>But austerity is not working; indeed, it is counterproductive. In the short to medium term, fiscal consolidation \u2013 whether in the form of cutting government spending or increasing revenues \u2013 results in lower output and employment, which means lower tax collection, higher deficits, and escalating debt relative to GDP. Savvy investors, like frustrated voters, recognize that low growth and high unemployment actually enlarge deficits and add to debt in the short run. That is why, after more than two years, interest rates are rising, not falling, in countries crushed by onerous austerity measures.</p> <p>In fact, there is no simple relationship between the size of a government's deficit or debt and the interest rate that it must pay. British government bonds now offer significantly lower interest rates than those of France, Italy, or Spain, even though the United Kingdom's fiscal position is considerably worse.</p> <p>Greece is caught in a classic debt trap, as the interest rate on its public debt has soared beyond its growth rate by a considerable margin; Spain is teetering on the brink. Austerity in Europe has confirmed the International Monetary Fund's warning that overdoing fiscal consolidation weakens economic activity, undermines market confidence, and diminishes popular support for adjustment.</p> <p>In the long run, many eurozone countries, including Germany, require fiscal consolidation in order to stabilise and reduce their debt-to-GDP ratios. But the process should be gradual and backloaded \u2013 with much of the consolidation coming after Europe's economies have returned to a sustainable growth path.</p> <p>Structural reforms are also necessary in most European economies to bolster competitiveness and boost potential growth. But such reforms take time: German chancellor Angela Merkel appears to have forgotten that it took more than a decade and roughly \u20ac2tn (\u00a31.61tn) in subsidies for structural reforms to make the former East Germany competitive with the rest of the country.</p> <p>Italian prime minister Mario Monti and French president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande are right: Europe needs bold, co-ordinated policies to promote growth, along with market-based structural reforms to foster competition and an easing of fiscal targets until output and employment recover.</p> <p>But how can significant new growth initiatives be financed?

      "bodyText": "Fiscal profligacy did not cause the sovereign debt crisis engulfing Europe, and fiscal austerity will not solve it. On the contrary, such austerity has aggravated the crisis and now threatens to bring down the euro and throw the global economy into another tailspin. In 2007, Spain and Ireland were models of fiscal rectitude, with far lower debt-to-GDP ratios than Germany had. Investors were not worried about default risk on Spanish or Irish sovereign debt, or about Italy's chronically large sovereign debt. Indeed, Italy boasted the lowest deficit-to-GDP ratio in the eurozone, and the Italian government had no problem refinancing at attractive interest rates. Even Greece, despite its rapidly eroding competitiveness and increasingly unsustainable fiscal path, could attract the capital that it needed. Deluded by the convergence of bond yields that followed the euro's launch, investors fed a decade-long private-sector credit boom in Europe's less developed periphery countries, and failed to recognize real-estate bubbles in Spain and Ireland, and Greece's slide into insolvency. When growth slowed sharply and credit flows collapsed in the wake of the Great Recession, budget revenues plummeted, governments were forced to socialise private-sector liabilities, and fiscal deficits and debt soared. With the exception of Greece, the deterioration in public finances was a symptom of the crisis, not its cause. Moreover, the deterioration was predictable: history shows that the real stock of government debt explodes in the wake of recessions caused by financial crises. Overlooking the evidence, European leaders, spearheaded by Germany, misdiagnosed the problem as one of fiscal profligacy for which painful austerity is the only cure. On this view, significant and rapid reductions in government deficits and debt are a precondition to restoring government credibility and investor confidence, stemming contagion, bringing down interest rates, and reviving economic growth. There is also a moral hazard aspect to the austerity argument: easing repayment terms for spendthrift governments will only encourage reckless behavior in the future \u2013 forgiving past sins perpetuates sinning. Moreover, virtuous creditors should not bail out irresponsible borrowers, be they private or public. From this perspective, austerity is the necessary and just penance for reprobates like Greece, Spain, and Italy. But austerity is not working; indeed, it is counterproductive. In the short to medium term, fiscal consolidation \u2013 whether in the form of cutting government spending or increasing revenues \u2013 results in lower output and employment, which means lower tax collection, higher deficits, and escalating debt relative to GDP. Savvy investors, like frustrated voters, recognize that low growth and high unemployment actually enlarge deficits and add to debt in the short run. That is why, after more than two years, interest rates are rising, not falling, in countries crushed by onerous austerity measures. In fact, there is no simple relationship between the size of a government's deficit or debt and the interest rate that it must pay. British government bonds now offer significantly lower interest rates than those of France, Italy, or Spain, even though the United Kingdom's fiscal position is considerably worse. Greece is caught in a classic debt trap, as the interest rate on its public debt has soared beyond its growth rate by a considerable margin; Spain is teetering on the brink. Austerity in Europe has confirmed the International Monetary Fund's warning that overdoing fiscal consolidation weakens economic activity, undermines market confidence, and diminishes popular support for adjustment. In the long run, many eurozone countries, including Germany, require fiscal consolidation in order to stabilise and reduce their debt-to-GDP ratios. But the process should be gradual and backloaded \u2013 with much of the consolidation coming after Europe's economies have returned to a sustainable growth path. Structural reforms are also necessary in most European economies to bolster competitiveness and boost potential growth. But such reforms take time: German chancellor Angela Merkel appears to have forgotten that it took more than a decade and roughly \u20ac2tn (\u00a31.61tn) in subsidies for structural reforms to make the former East Germany competitive with the rest of the country. Italian prime minister Mario Monti and French president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande are right: Europe needs bold, co-ordinated policies to promote growth, along with market-based structural reforms to foster competition and an easing of fiscal targets until output and employment recover. But how can significant new growth initiatives be financed? The reality is that the rest of Europe cannot succeed in restoring growth without Germany, and Germany remains wedded to the austerity cure. With a modest fiscal deficit, record-low borrowing costs, and a huge current-account surplus, Germany has the financial firepower to unleash a significant stimulus. But Germany sees no need to stimulate its own economy, and is willing to consider only modest eurozone measures, such as additional capital for the European Investment Bank, a small pilot program for European Union \"project bonds\" for infrastructure investment, and more rapid deployment of unspent EU structural funds. Germany refuses even to allow spending on high-priority infrastructure projects to be exempted from the unrealistic deficit targets set by the EU's new \"fiscal compact\". Despite pleas from the IMF and the OECD, Germany also remains implacably opposed to eurobonds, which could ease the funding constraints of other eurozone members and bolster the resources of the European Stability Mechanism, which currently does not provide a credible firewall against a run on Spanish or Italian sovereign debt \u2013 or on the European banks that hold it.

But a shift toward policies to promote growth, supported by the easing of deficit targets and the issuance of eurobonds, is essential to bring Europe back from the brink of sustained recession, to stabilise Europe's financial markets, and to prevent another significant disruption to global capital markets. \u2022 Laura Tyson, a former chair of the US President's Council of Economic Advisers, is a professor at the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley.

      "bodyText": "The drinks giant Diageo, owner of Johnnie Walker and Bell's whisky, is to spend around \u00a31bn on substantially increasing its whisky production to exploit a sharp surge in global demand for Scotch. The London-based firm announced on Wednesday morning that it would build a new malt distillery, expand its existing whisky distilleries and greatly increase its bottling capacity to cope with the increase in worldwide sales, as part of a five-year expansion strategy. Scotch whisky and malt whisky have seen a significant increase in sales worldwide, raising anxieties that the industry may be unable to keep pace with demand, leading to temporary shortages and price rises. It is now Scotland's largest export, with Diageo reporting a 50% growth in overall net sales of its Scotch whiskies and malts over the last five years both within the UK and abroad, taking total sales to \u00a33bn and producing a third of its gross profits last year.

Earlier this year the Scotch Whisky Association revealed that total exports had broken through \u00a34bn a year, reaching \u00a34.2bn, and said it had become the drink of choice for middle classes in emerging economies of China, south Asia and South America. Around half of that \u00a31bn anticipated investment will be tied up in the cash value of the whisky being matured for future sale and blending: it estimates that it will need \u00a3500m in working capital to cover that stock over the next five years. The remaining \u00a3500m will be invested in the new distillery facilities, construction and on hiring a further 100 staff, many of whom would be apprentices. Diageo said that spending would see a further 250 construction jobs each year until 2017, with a further 500 jobs created elsewhere in the economy. Paul Walsh, the firm's chief executive, said: \"This is a pivotal moment in the development of the Scotch whisky category for Diageo. Over recent years our brands have achieved remarkable, sustained global growth. Scotch whisky is Scotland's most celebrated manufactured export, led by brands like Johnnie Walker, resonating with consumers from Boston to Beijing. \"We expect that success to continue, particularly in the high growth markets around the world, which is why we are announcing this major investment in Scotch whisky production, committing over \u00a31bn in the next five years, to seize that opportunity for global growth.\" The announcement suggests that Diageo has discounted or downgraded the impacts of Scottish government plans to introduce a minimum price of 50p a unit on all alcoholic drinks, and similar proposals by the UK government to introduce minimum pricing in the rest of the UK. When the Scottish minimum pricing measures became law last month, the SWA repeated its warnings it would hit domestic consumers by increasing the basic price of a bottle of whisky to \u00a314 and seriously damage the industry's efforts to combat tariff controls overseas. John Swinney, the Scottish finance secretary, said this was very welcome news. He stressed this showed the industry had a strong future, hinting that the Scottish government was unimpressed by the industry's warnings about minimum pricing. \"The investment in new distilleries and warehousing capacity is a vivid illustration of the positive and optimistic outlook for demand in the sector,\" he said. \"This major decision by Diageo provides continued evidence that new private sector investment will help to deliver economic recovery and demonstrates that Scotland is very much open for business and investment.\"",

    "fields": {
      "standfirst": "The freedom of money, financial markets and people to move \u2013 and thus to escape regulation and taxation \u2013 could lead to a deregulatory race to the bottom", 
      "body": "<p>Nowadays there is ample evidence that financial systems, whether in Asia in the 1990s or a decade later in the United States and Europe, are vulnerable to breakdowns. The cost in interrupted growth and unemployment has been intolerably large.</p> <p>But, in the absence of international consensus on some key points, reform will be greatly weakened, if not aborted. The freedom of money, financial markets and people to move \u2013 and thus to escape regulation and taxation \u2013 might be an acceptable, even constructive, brake on excessive official intervention, but not if a deregulatory race to the bottom prevents adoption of needed ethical and prudential standards.</p> <p>Perhaps most important is a coherent, consistent approach to dealing with the imminent failure of \"systemically important\" institutions. Taxpayers and governments alike are tired of bailing out creditors for fear of the destructive contagious effects of failure \u2013 even as bailouts encourage excessive risk-taking.</p> <p>By law in the US, new approaches superseding established bankruptcy procedures dictate the demise rather than the rescue of failing firms, whether by sale, merger, or liquidation. But such efforts' success will depend on complementary approaches elsewhere, most importantly in the United Kingdom and other key financial centres.</p> <p>Strict uniformity of regulatory practices may not be necessary. For example, the UK and the US may be adopting approaches that differ with respect to protecting commercial banks from more speculative, proprietary trading, but the policy concerns are broadly similar \u2013 and may not be so pressing elsewhere, where banking traditions are different and trading is more restrained. But other jurisdictions should not act to undercut the restrictions imposed by home authorities.</p> <p>Closely related to these reforms is reform of the international monetary system. Indeed, one might legitimately question whether we have a \"system\" at all, at least compared to the Bretton Woods arrangements and, before that, the seeming simplicity of the gold standard. No one today has been able to exert authority systematically and consistently, and there is no officially sanctified and controlled international currency.</p> <p>Arguably, the ideal of a well-defined and effective international monetary regime has become more difficult to realise as markets and capital flows have become vastly larger and more capricious. Indeed, the global economy, it is said, has grown \u2013 and emerging countries have flourished \u2013 without a more organised system.</p> <p>But what is too often overlooked is that international monetary disorder lay at the root of the successive financial crises of the 1990s, and played an even more striking role in the crisis that erupted in 2008. The sustained and, in a sense, complementary imbalances in the US and Asia stand out.</p> <p>From 2000 to 2007, the US ran a cumulative current-account deficit of roughly $5.5tn (\u00a33.6tn), with nearly symmetrical offsetting increases in reserves in China and Japan. China found it useful to run a large trade surplus, using a very high rate of internal savings and inward foreign investment to support its industrialisation and rapid growth.</p> <p>By contrast, the US, in the face of slow growth, was content to sustain exceptionally high levels of consumption at the expense of personal savings, inflating a massive housing bubble that burst with a very large and deeply disturbing bang.</p> <p>The practical and inescapable lesson is that when any country is left to its own policy devices, its preferences may lead to prolonged and ultimately unsustainable imbalances. Sooner or later, adjustment will be necessary \u2013 if not by considered domestic policy or a well-functioning international monetary system, then by financial crisis.</p> <p>Not so long ago, we were comforted by theorising that floating exchange rates would mediate international adjustments in a timely and orderly way.

      "bodyText": "Nowadays there is ample evidence that financial systems, whether in Asia in the 1990s or a decade later in the United States and Europe, are vulnerable to breakdowns. The cost in interrupted growth and unemployment has been intolerably large. But, in the absence of international consensus on some key points, reform will be greatly weakened, if not aborted. The freedom of money, financial markets and people to move \u2013 and thus to escape regulation and taxation \u2013 might be an acceptable, even constructive, brake on excessive official intervention, but not if a deregulatory race to the bottom prevents adoption of needed ethical and prudential standards. Perhaps most important is a coherent, consistent approach to dealing with the imminent failure of \"systemically important\" institutions. Taxpayers and governments alike are tired of bailing out creditors for fear of the destructive contagious effects of failure \u2013 even as bailouts encourage excessive risk-taking. By law in the US, new approaches superseding established bankruptcy procedures dictate the demise rather than the rescue of failing firms, whether by sale, merger, or liquidation. But such efforts' success will depend on complementary approaches elsewhere, most importantly in the United Kingdom and other key financial centres. Strict uniformity of regulatory practices may not be necessary. For example, the UK and the US may be adopting approaches that differ with respect to protecting commercial banks from more speculative, proprietary trading, but the policy concerns are broadly similar \u2013 and may not be so pressing elsewhere, where banking traditions are different and trading is more restrained. But other jurisdictions should not act to undercut the restrictions imposed by home authorities. Closely related to these reforms is reform of the international monetary system. Indeed, one might legitimately question whether we have a \"system\" at all, at least compared to the Bretton Woods arrangements and, before that, the seeming simplicity of the gold standard. No one today has been able to exert authority systematically and consistently, and there is no officially sanctified and controlled international currency. Arguably, the ideal of a well-defined and effective international monetary regime has become more difficult to realise as markets and capital flows have become vastly larger and more capricious. Indeed, the global economy, it is said, has grown \u2013 and emerging countries have flourished \u2013 without a more organised system. But what is too often overlooked is that international monetary disorder lay at the root of the successive financial crises of the 1990s, and played an even more striking role in the crisis that erupted in 2008. The sustained and, in a sense, complementary imbalances in the US and Asia stand out. From 2000 to 2007, the US ran a cumulative current-account deficit of roughly $5.5tn (\u00a33.6tn), with nearly symmetrical offsetting increases in reserves in China and Japan. China found it useful to run a large trade surplus, using a very high rate of internal savings and inward foreign investment to support its industrialisation and rapid growth. By contrast, the US, in the face of slow growth, was content to sustain exceptionally high levels of consumption at the expense of personal savings, inflating a massive housing bubble that burst with a very large and deeply disturbing bang. The practical and inescapable lesson is that when any country is left to its own policy devices, its preferences may lead to prolonged and ultimately unsustainable imbalances. Sooner or later, adjustment will be necessary \u2013 if not by considered domestic policy or a well-functioning international monetary system, then by financial crisis. Not so long ago, we were comforted by theorising that floating exchange rates would mediate international adjustments in a timely and orderly way. But, in the real world, many countries, particularly but not limited to small, open economies, simply find it impractical or undesirable to permit their currency to float. We are left with the certainty, however awkward, that active participation in an open world economy requires some surrender of economic sovereignty. Or, to put the point more positively, it requires a willingness to co-ordinate policies more effectively. The possibilities include: \u2022 Stronger surveillance by the International Monetary Fund and a firmer commitment by countries to abide by \"best practices\" and agreed norms. \u2022 Direct and public recommendations by the IMF, the G20, or others, following mandatory consultation. \u2022 Qualification or disqualification with respect to the use of IMF or other credit facilities (for example, central banks' swap lines). \u2022 Interest or other financial penalties or incentives along the lines under consideration in Europe. But, if approaches that build on past failure do not seem sufficiently effective, perhaps a new approach toward currency fluctuations would be more promising. That would require some agreement about appropriate \"equilibrium\" exchange rates, with a fairly wide band that would allow for uncertainty and permit the market to exert its own discipline. But individual countries would orient intervention and economic policies toward defending the equilibrium rate, or, more radically, an international authority might authorise aggressive intervention by trading partners to promote consistency.
