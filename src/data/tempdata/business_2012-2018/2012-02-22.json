Thus chief executive Richard Kirk's offer to pay a 35% takeover premium was approved and nobody stopped to ask whether the boss's financing arrangements were too aggressive for anybody's long-term health. After all, the bid announcement did not contain a portrait of a company enjoying explosive success: profit on ordinary activities had risen from \u00a322.6m to \u00a325m in the year to March 2005 but trading conditions since October 2005 were described as \"more challenging.\" Aggressive financing was part of the culture of the times, of course. Leverage was the rage and private equity-style deals were appearing everywhere, especially in the retail sector. All the same, Kirk's proposal can be seen as an extreme version, even by 2005 standards: the capital structure, arranged by investment bank Goldman Sachs, relied on the issue of \u00a3110m-worth of so-called pay-in-kind notes (PIKs) to a couple of US hedge funds, Och-Ziff and Perry Capital. These notes attracted an annual interest rate of 17.2%. Those are pauper's terms. Unless you refinance quickly, or produce truly explosive increases in profits every year, you will be slowly strangled by the law of compounding because the PIK feature means that interest payments are rolled up every year and added to the total pile of debt to be repaid at a fixed point in the future. In the colder post-2007 climate for financing, Kirk failed to get rid of the PIKs. Thus the inevitable process of financial strangulation began. By 2010, the PIK liabilities had reached \u00a3301m. Peacocks' total debts at the point of administration last month are thought to have been about \u00a3750m, of which the PIKs may be roughly \u00a3400m. The 2005 buy-out was an absurd bull market deal. Kirk's bet rested entirely on the expectation, or hope, that cheaper financing would be available within a year or two.

      "body": "<p>The bosses of London-listed oil and gas explorer Cove Energy are in line for a \u00a338m payday after Royal Dutch Shell put in a near-\u00a31bn takeover bid. </p> <p>John Craven, Cove's chief executive and veteran geologist, is line for a \u00a318m payout less than three years after he created the African-focus explorer. Michael Blaha, Cove's chairman and Shell's former head of Alergia, holds shares and options worth \u00a313.5m under the 195p-a-share cash offer Shell. The company's finance director, Michael Nolan, is in line for \u00a37.1m. </p> <p>The offer, which values Cove at \u00a3992m, comes a month after Cove reported one of the world's largest gas discoveries off the coast of Mozambique.

      "bodyText": "The bosses of London-listed oil and gas explorer Cove Energy are in line for a \u00a338m payday after Royal Dutch Shell put in a near-\u00a31bn takeover bid. John Craven, Cove's chief executive and veteran geologist, is line for a \u00a318m payout less than three years after he created the African-focus explorer. Michael Blaha, Cove's chairman and Shell's former head of Alergia, holds shares and options worth \u00a313.5m under the 195p-a-share cash offer Shell. The company's finance director, Michael Nolan, is in line for \u00a37.1m. The offer, which values Cove at \u00a3992m, comes a month after Cove reported one of the world's largest gas discoveries off the coast of Mozambique. Cove owns a 8.5% stake in Mozambique's Rovum Offshore Area 1, which operator Anadarko reckons could hold more than 30tn cubic feet of recoverable natural gas. That discovery and similar finds by Italy's Eni suggest the area could contain up to 60m cubic feet of natural gas, which would be enough to support a liquefied natural gas (LNG) project to supply fast-growing Asian markets. \"East Africa is a major prospective hydrocarbon province, which has seen a significant increase in exploration activity in recent years,\" Shell said in its offer document. \"Shell already has interests in Tanzania, and the acquisition of Cove would mark Shell's entry into exciting new hydrocarbon provinces in Kenya and Mozambique, with significant potential for new LNG from recent gas discoveries offshore Mozambique, and further complementary exploration positions in East Africa.\" Shell's offer represents a 70% premium to Cove's share price before it put itself up for sale in January, and a 29% premium to Cove's average share price over the last five days.

    "webTitle": "Germany at odds with Dutch and IMF boss over eurozone bailout fund", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Germany threatened to undermine this week's \u20ac130bn (\u00a3110bn) deal to bail out Greece by refusing to bolster the firewalls set up to prevent the eurozone debt crisis from spreading. As markets dipped all over Europe amid fears that Greece would never be able to meet its debt obligations, Angela Merkel's chief spokesman said Berlin saw \"no necessity\" to enhance the planned \u20ac500bn European stability mechanism (ESM), the new bailout fund due to be in place from July. Highlighting how unpopular aid for Greece is in Germany, opposition to the bailout deal was growing within Merkel's coalition on Wednesday. Several MPs from Merkel's conservatives and her junior partner, the Free Democrats (FDP), said they planned to oppose the package, meaning that she would be unlikely to win next week's parliamentary vote on the deal without the humiliation of relying on her socialist and green opponents . Merkel's weakening domestic position came as her government's stance on the ESM left Germany at loggerheads with not only the Dutch government but also the IMF and its managing director, Christine Lagarde. Both want the ESM to embrace funds still untouched within the current rescue fund, the European financial stability facility (EFSF). It has between \u20ac150bn and \u20ac250bn left, which would allow the combined funds to total \u20ac650-750bn \u2013 still well short of the \u20ac1 trillion originally forecast, let alone the \u20ac2tn demanded by market players. Lagarde favours at least \u20ac1tn being set aside \u2013 and has further ruffled Berlin by calling for eurobonds to cover not only Greek but also, for example, Spanish and Italian debt in event of a wider crisis. The IMF managing director is refusing \u2013 before of next week's G20 meeting in Mexico \u2013 to commit the IMF to a specific share of the new \u20ac130bn bailout for Greece. Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, the German finance minister, has said it would be \u20ac13bn \u2013 plus \u20ac10bn rolled over from the first \u20ac109bn rescue. This would amount to just 10% of the new fund compared with the 27% the IMF contributed to the first one. The Washington-based body is under pressure from the White House to resist European demands for more funds. Jan Kees de Jager, the Dutch finance minister, who helped broker the deal on Greece, has made his support for the package dependent on an enhanced EFSF/ESM combination. Doubts over the proposed Greek bailout spread to the markets and sent shares lower on Wednesday. The FTSE 100 edged lower for the second day running, closing down 11.65 points at 5916.55 after Tuesday's 17-point decline in the wake of the overnight Greek deal. Germany's Dax was down almost 1%, while France's Cac was 0.52% lower. The Athens market fell nearly 6%. Lee McDarby, at Investec Corporate Treasury, said: \"Serious reservations about the ability of the Greek government to push through the required fiscal cuts have hampered any positive market reaction so far.\" Meanwhile the cost of insuring peripheral eurozone government debt against default rose again, with five-year Italian credit default swaps up from 380 basis points on Tuesday to 392. This means it would cost \u00a3380,000 to insure \u00a310m worth of Italian debt. Spanish CDS contracts rose from 365 to 372 basis points, while Greece climbed from 70 to 72 basis points, according to data monitor Markit. Greece's five-year bond yield also passed 56%. The French Socialists' abstention in a parliamentary vote on the bailout fund also showed that a possible leftwing presidential election victory in May this year could derail the EU's eurozone rescue efforts. The Socialist party, whose candidate Fran\u00e7ois Hollande leads opinion polls for the April-May election, sat out Tuesday's lower house vote on the creation of a permanent ESM in protest at austerity policies in Europe. President Nicolas Sarkozy's conservative government called the move a \"historic error\" and berated the Socialists in parliament on Wednesday. Even the left-leaning newspaper Lib\u00e9ration was critical in an editorial. The abstention, which did not prevent the bill passing in the conservative-led National Assembly, was in line with Hollande's campaign pledge to seek to amend an EU fiscal compact agreed last month to add clauses on growth and investment. The European commission, meanwhile, flexed its new fiscal surveillance muscles by threatening to suspend almost \u20ac0.5bn in structural aid to Hungary for persistently breaching budget deficit rules.",

Several MPs from Merkel's conservatives and her junior partner, the Free Democrats (FDP), said they planned to oppose the package, meaning that she would be unlikely to win next week's parliamentary vote on the deal without the humiliation of relying on her socialist and green opponents .</p> <p>Merkel's weakening domestic position came as her government's stance on the ESM left Germany at loggerheads with not only the Dutch government but also the IMF and its managing director, Christine Lagarde. Both want the ESM to embrace funds still untouched within the current rescue fund, <a href=\"http://www.efsf.europa.eu/about/index.htm\" title=\"\">the European financial stability facility (EFSF)</a>.</p> <p>It has between \u20ac150bn and \u20ac250bn left, which would allow the combined funds to total \u20ac650-750bn \u2013 still well short of the \u20ac1 trillion originally forecast, let alone the \u20ac2tn demanded by market players. Lagarde favours at least \u20ac1tn being set aside \u2013 and has further ruffled Berlin by calling for eurobonds to cover not only Greek but also, for example, Spanish and Italian debt in event of a wider crisis.</p> <p>The IMF managing director is refusing \u2013 before of next week's G20 meeting in Mexico \u2013 to commit the IMF to a specific share of the new \u20ac130bn bailout for Greece. Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, the German finance minister, has said it would be \u20ac13bn \u2013 plus \u20ac10bn rolled over from the first \u20ac109bn rescue.</p> <p>This would amount to just 10% of the new fund compared with the 27% the IMF contributed to the first one. The Washington-based body is under pressure from the White House to resist European demands for more funds.</p> <p>Jan Kees de Jager, the Dutch finance minister, who helped broker the deal on Greece, has made his support for the package dependent on an enhanced EFSF/ESM combination.</p> <p>Doubts over the proposed Greek bailout spread to the markets and sent shares lower on Wednesday.

BAA said it had delivered a strong operational year with continued significant investment that would ultimately see it turn a profit, although interest payments on its \u00a310bn debt continued to drag its annual accounts into the red. Colin Matthews, chief executive of BAA, stressed a continuing improvement in customer satisfaction. He said: \"Passengers say Heathrow is getting better. Our punctuality is the best in a decade, passenger ratings are up in total, and particularly for transfers and on security waiting time. \"And we had more passengers, who spent more freely in our retail and car parks.\" He said BAA had made almost \u00a3900m of investment in Heathrow over the year, mainly in the building of Terminal 2, which will handle 20 million passengers a year after it opens in 2014. At BAA's second London airport, Stansted, passenger numbers continued to fall even on the disappointing 2010 figures, down to 18.0 million from 18.6 million. Rising interest payments on BAA's debts turned the operating profit of \u00a3572m into a pre-tax loss of \u00a3256m - a \u00a360m improvement on its 2010 losses. The interest bill rose from \u00a3696m to \u00a3790m last year. Matthews insisted: \"BAA will make a profit. Predicting exactly when is difficult - but it will make a profit. The investors have always been there for the long term. \"It was a good year for improving passenger experience, which we have to do for people to see clearly: now people can see that the capital investment we're making to transform the facility will make it a better airport, and a good investment.\" Heathrow operated at virtually full capacity last year, with 69.4 million passengers. BAA's revenues were up 9.9%, reflecting higher landing charges and retail income. BAA raised \u00a33bn in new financing last year and said it would pay dividends to its ultimate shareholders in 2012 for the first time since the Ferrovial-led consortium bought the operator in 2006.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Fears of a long and debilitating depression, one that saps the energy from even the most persistent entrepreneur, prompted Bank of England policymakers David Miles and Adam Posen to vote for an extra \u00a375bn of quantitative easing at this month's monetary policy meeting. The other seven committee members disagreed. Governor Sir Mervyn King and his less dovish colleagues felt \u00a350bn was enough. And reading the health check on the UK economy prepared by the Bank's local agents, it is easy to see how the committee came to a split decision. The agents paint a lacklustre picture of economic life, but not one of crisis. There is plenty of meat for pessimists to chew on, from a still painfully low level of bank lending to falling levels of activity in the construction sector. But neither bank lending nor construction is heading for another crisis. For those MPC members who believe all they need to achieve is stability before companies start to invest again, the agents' report came closer than before to signalling that the economy has reached some kind of plateau. However, there were key warning signs that the MPC noted but refused to highlight as potentially damaging. Business investment continues to suffer. The agents' report says: \"Investment intentions continued to weaken, suggesting little growth in spending on capital over the next 12 months.\" When UK firms are already well behind the investment curve, with many operating 10 or 15-year-old machinery, this conclusion alone by the agents should stir George Osborne from obsessing about Tory internal politics to worrying about the economy. Then there is unemployment, which the MPC says is likely to go higher as employers seek higher productivity through significant job cuts. And finally rising oil prices. At the time of writing the MPC report they were up 5% since the end of January. Now Brent crude is above $121 a barrel, up 10%. Oil is still the basic lubricant of every economy and Britain is especially vulnerable to spikes in prices. No wonder Miles and Posen worry. Maybe the rest of the MPC and the chancellor should shrug off their complacency and join them.",

The other seven committee members disagreed. Governor Sir Mervyn King and his less dovish colleagues felt \u00a350bn was enough.</p> <p>And reading the health check on the UK economy prepared by the Bank's local agents, it is easy to see how the committee came to a split decision.</p> <p>The agents paint a lacklustre picture of economic life, but not one of crisis.</p> <p>There is plenty of meat for pessimists to chew on, from a still painfully low level of bank lending to falling levels of activity in the construction sector. But neither bank lending nor construction is heading for another crisis.</p> <p>For those MPC members who believe all they need to achieve is stability before companies start to invest again, the agents' report came closer than before to signalling that the economy has reached some kind of plateau.</p> <p>However, there were key warning signs that the MPC noted but refused to highlight as potentially damaging.</p> <p>Business investment continues to suffer. The agents' report says: \"Investment intentions continued to weaken, suggesting little growth in spending on capital over the next 12 months.\"</p> <p>When UK firms are already well behind the investment curve, with many operating 10 or 15-year-old machinery, this conclusion alone by the agents should stir George Osborne from obsessing about Tory internal politics to worrying about the economy.</p> <p>Then there is unemployment, which the MPC says is likely to go higher as employers seek higher productivity through significant job cuts.</p> <p>And finally rising oil prices. At the time of writing the MPC report they were up 5% since the end of January. Now Brent crude is above $121 a barrel, up 10%.</p> <p>Oil is still the basic lubricant of every economy and Britain is especially vulnerable to spikes in prices. No wonder Miles and Posen worry. Maybe the rest of the MPC and the chancellor should shrug off their complacency and join them.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Bank of England policymakers were split over the size of the stimulus required by the UK economy, minutes of the Bank's February meeting have revealed on Wednesday. David Miles joined long-standing \"dove\" Adam Posen in voting for a \u00a375bn boost, but were outvoted by the other seven monetary policy committee (MPC) members, who supported a \u00a350bn increase in quantitative easing (QE) to \u00a3325bn. The news, which sent the pound falling, is likely to reopen the debate about whether the central bank will add further QE in May. Howard Archer, chief UK economist at research firm IHS Global Insight, said: \"The minutes reveal increasing divergences of opinion within the MPC over policy but suggest that the door remains open for more quantitative easing should the economy struggle for sustained growth over the coming months. Significantly, not one of the nine MPC members favoured less than \u00a350bn more QE in February while two of them wanted a \u00a375bn increase. It is little surprise that Adam Posen wanted even more QE and it is notable that he was joined by David Miles.\" The minutes reveal that Miles and Posen argued there was a risk of a prolonged period of depressed demand that would cause inflation to fall materially below target in the medium term. Moreover, extra QE now would reduce the risk of a spiral of increasing unemployment and scrapping of capacity by firms, they said. However, most MPC members argued a bigger increase than \u00a350bn \"risked sending a signal that the committee thought the economic situation was weaker than it was\". Daniel Solomon, an economist at the Centre for Economics and Business Research (CEBR), added: \"The Bank is walking a tightrope. Since QE has its effect one to two years in the future, whether its decision to expand the programme will be considered prescient or foolhardy will depend on the state of the UK economy in 2013 and 2014. \"The Bank knows this will be hard to predict ... If the eurozone, our largest trading partner, can avoid disorderly default by several of its member states, then an export-led recovery might take hold at home. This would mean that the recent expansion of the QE programme, and any further expansions, risk overheating the UK economy and driving up inflation. If the eurozone crisis goes sour and the UK finds itself in another recession, then more QE will be needed to keep growth from free-falling and inflation on target.\" The CEBR expects the QE programme to reach \u00a3400bn by the end of this year. In its quarterly projections, published last week, the Bank of England increased forecasts to show inflation only just below target in two years, at around 1.8%. Its growth forecast was broadly unchanged, with volatility expected in the short term because of one-off factors such as an extra public holiday to mark Queen Elizabeth's diamond jubilee celebrations. \"Thereafter growth should strengthen gradually, supported by a recovery in households' real income growth and the expansionary stance of monetary policy,\" the Bank added. The MPC also highlighted how uncertain it is about its inflation predictions over the medium term. Risks include disruption to the supply of oil and gas and upward wage- or price-setting behaviour by companies against a backdrop of weak productivity growth. \"There were also risks to the downside that might result in demand growth being too weak to absorb the pool of spare capacity sufficiently,\" it said. Last week Posen said that UK monetary policy and forecasts appeared to be on the right track. Meanwhile, in a speech in Glasgow on Tuesday, deputy governor Charlie Bean forecast a return to modest growth, albeit after a sluggish first half to 2012.",

      "bodyText": "Centrica, the owner of British Gas, has boosted its presence in North Sea exploration with a \u00a3246m deal for seven oil and gas fields. The energy group announced the acquisition on the eve of annual results that are set to stoke the debate over household bills, with Centrica forecast to post a 4% increase in pre-tax profits to \u00a32.5bn. Wednesday's deal with Total, the French multinational, means that Centrica has increased its oil and gas reserves by 45% since last year, following two deals with Norway's state-owned Statoil. Mark Hanafin, managing director of Centrica Energy, said: \"This acquisition in the North Sea provides a good fit with our existing portfolio and strategy, bringing strong cash flow and adding value for Centrica. It underlines our commitment to invest where we see attractive opportunities, securing future energy supplies for the UK.\" The Total fields are in three areas that have estimated reserves of 22m barrels of oil equivalent [boe] and are expected to produce around 9,300 boe a day this year. About 64% of the output will be oil. North Sea oil and gas production has fallen since its prime in 1999 when the UK was the world's sixth largest player in the market. It has now slipped to 18th, but up to 24bn more barrels of oil are still expected to be discovered over the next 30 years, according to calculations by the Department of Energy and Climate Change. Centrica's oil and gas production business, also known as its \"upstream arm\", generates about 43% of the group's pre-tax profits and supplies about 80% of British Gas's energy.
