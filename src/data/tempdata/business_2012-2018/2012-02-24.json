      "bodyText": "Four former executives of Lloyds Banking Group who last week had part of their bonuses clawed back as a result of an insurance mis-selling scandal may now be in line to receive shares worth \u00a32.2m for completing the takeover of the troubled HBOS bank. Former chief executive Eric Daniels, former head of retail Helen Weir, former insurance boss Archie Kane, and Truett Tate, former corporate banking head, could have shares that were awarded to them three years ago released in April. Earlier this week all four had bonuses \"clawed back\" after the bank took a \u00a33.2bn provision to cover compensation payments for mis-selling payment protection insurance. That provision plunged the bank to a \u00a33.5bn loss for 2011. With the three year integration of HBOS complete, after the loss 28,000 jobs and \u00a33.2bn of integration costs, the chairman, Sir Win Bischoff, admitted that \"with the benefit of hindsight now, obviously it [the merger] has not been as good an idea as people thought at the time - and that includes all the shareholders who voted in favour of it\". Bischoff was being asked about the losses caused by HBOS, rescued by Lloyds during September 2008, rather the process of integration, which has achieved its target to save \u00a32bn a year. The precise payouts to executives will be known in future annual reports, but the latest information for 2010 shows that the two sets of performance criteria attached to the \"April 2009 Integration Award\" had been \"met or exceeded\". One target is based on cost savings, while the other is linked to non-financial measures - although the bank's remuneration committee may decide not to allow all, or even any, of the shares to be released. Daniels, who last week saw \u00a3580,000 of bonus payments clawed back, stands to receive most shares, worth some \u00a3800,000 at current prices. Other so-called long-term incentive plans have not paid out since 2006. \"Outstanding long-term incentive awards will continue to vest at the end of the relevant three-year performance period to the extent the performance conditions have been met,\" said a Lloyds spokeswoman . Despite the \u00a33.5bn of losses, the bank is paying \u00a3375m in bonuses, down 30% on a year ago. The average bonus across the 100,000 workforce stands at \u00a33,900, while the executives are taking an average 50% cut to their bonuses. At 35.73p the shares were the biggest fallers in the FTSE 100, down 2.3%. The drop has left the taxpayer with a \u00a310bn loss on the 41% stake in the bank, amid concerns about its forecasts this year for profitability, measured by so-called net interest margin. \"The outlook statement contains quite a few home truths,\" said Ian Gordon, banks analyst at Investec. Chief executive, Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio, reiterated that the prolonged low interest rate environment would mean some key targets would not be met on time, but the bank would benefit from a faster than expected reduction in impairment charges during 2012. The outlook was a \"not a profit warning\" and just \"realistic\" about the economy, where he expects house prices to be \"broadly flat\" for the next two years, with \"fairly modest\" growth in the economy in the second half. Base rates will stay at 0.5% into 2013, and unemployment rise and then peak at 9% next year. Horta-Os\u00f3rio had earmarked a further 15,000 job cuts when he took over a year ago and embarked on a clean-out of the previous management team. But the bank stressed that a further \u00a3200m of cost savings now identified for 2014 would not result in further redundancies. Horta-Os\u00f3rio returned to work last month after a two-month absence brought on when he could not sleep for five days in October, and he joked that he was sleeping \"like a baby\". He waived any bonus for 2011 because of his absence. When Horta-Os\u00f3rio's predecessor, Daniels, bowed out last February, he heralded a \u00a32.2bn profit for 2010, using his preferred measure which stripped out the costs of the takeover. The 2011 loss of \u00a33.5bn compares with a profit of \u00a3281m a year ago, while on Daniels' measure the profits were up 21% at \u00a32.7bn. Tim Tookey, the finance director, has left for a new job, is losing 25% of his bonus and there will be a gap until May when his successor, George Culmer will join from insurer RSA. Tookey, whose integration bonus has lapsed on his resignation, said he \"completely respected\" the decision of the Lloyds remuneration committee to reduce his bonus, while Horta-Os\u00f3rio said his previous employer, Santander, which also took a hit for PPI mis-selling during his tenure, had not notified him of any intention to claw back any bonuses he may have received. While the European Ccommission restriction on paying dividends, put in place at the time of the taxpayer bailout, have has now been lifted, the bank admitted that it was \"unclear\" when it might be able to start doing so. The bank also revealed the FSA enforcement investigation into the corporate division of Bank of Scotland was \"ongoing\". It could lead to fines and reprimands.",

P&amp;G's chief executive Bob McDonald told a US conference that the company planned to cut 5,700 jobs and reduce costs by $10bn by 2016. It plans to use less expensive packaging, eliminate duplicate work where it can and roll out products more quickly. ING Bank analyst Marco Gulpers said:</p> <blockquote> P&amp;G will be creating more flexibility that could impact peers, such as Unilever. P&amp;G is aiming to gain more access into emerging markets and with a lower cost base that is more agile, this will be easier to do. We believe P&amp;G could make another leap forward with this plan just as Unilever was about to catch up. </blockquote> <p>Meanwhile <strong>Reckitt Benckiser</strong> dropped 79p to \u00a334.21 after Goldman Sachs moved from buy to neutral. The bank cut its earnings per share estimate for 2012 by 4% and reduced its target price from \u00a338.50p to \u00a335.20.</p> <p>Overall the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> dipped 2.76 points to 5935.13. Angus Campbell, head of sales at Capital Spreads, said:</p> <blockquote> Caution ahead of some key events next week led to a flat trading session in London as buyer momentum seems to have dried up and once again the bulls have failed to test the 6000 level. <br> The reason for the timidity is that next week we have another round of the ECB's long-term refinancing operations (LTRO) to be announced and expectations are for a further boost to liquidity, but uncertainty remains as to how much money will be on offer. The first round of the LTRO proved successful in avoiding a credit crunch and we can expect demand to be high again as investors find the prospect of cheap cash which can be invested in high yielding short-term Spanish and Italian debt too good to be true. </blockquote> <p>Over the week the index added just 30 points, despite EU ministers agreeing a \u20ac130bn bailout plan for Greece in the early hours of Tuesday after an all night meeting. But Greece is not out of the woods yet. The deal still has to be ratified by a number of parliaments, including Germany and Finland. The country also has to finalise agreement with its private bondholders about exchanging their debt for lower value paper, which it hopes to do by 12 March.</p> <p>In the US positive housing and consumer sentiment figures pushed the Dow Jones Industrial Average above 13,000 for the second time in a week.</p> <p><strong>Lloyds Banking Group</strong> was the leading loser in the top index yesterday, down 0.845p to 35.73p after it announced a \u00a33.5bn loss and expressed caution about the outlook. <strong>Royal Bank of Scotland</strong>, which reported its own losses on Thursday, slipped 0.19p to 28.53p.</p> <p>Growing tensions with Iran and the threat of supply disruption sent crude prices higher, with Brent moving above $124 a barrel and recording its fifth consecutive weekly gain. The news supported oil company shares with <strong>BP</strong> up 0.85p at 496.2p ahead of the start of a court case next week relating to the Gulf of Mexico disaster.</p> <p><strong>Cove Energy</strong> jumped 40.25p to 235p after Thai state owned oil and gas group PTT made a 220p a share offer for East Africa focused explorer, trumping an earlier 195p a share offer from <strong>Royal Dutch Shell</strong>, down 6.5p to \u00a323.22.</p> <p>A number of bidders had been rumoured, with <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/marketforceslive/2012/feb/14/cove-bid-ftse-dips-moodys?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">an earlier report in this column predicting that offers could top 200p a share</a>, so further developments cannot be ruled out.</p> <p>Other oil companies in the area moved higher as investors looked for the next target, with <strong>Ophir Energy</strong> in particular demand, up 51p to 426p yesterday.</p> <p>Elsewhere <strong>Capita</strong> climbed 29.5p to 747.5p as a number of analysts upgraded the outsourcing group following its better than expected full year results. Investors had been concerned it was not winning enough new work, but it has announced a couple of deals in the last few days including a British army recruitment contract.</p> <p><strong>Hammerson</strong> was up 14.4p at 400.1p after it reported a 7% rise in net assets and unveiled plans to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/feb/24/developer-hammerson-office-portfolio-sale\" title=\"\">sell its entire office portfolio to concentrate on retail.</a></p> <p><strong>ITV</strong> added 2.3p to 80.1p ahead of results next week, on hopes of a cash return to shareholders. Omar Sheikh at Credit Suisse issued an outperform recommendation on the broadcaster, saying:</p> <blockquote> We remain bullish on ITV given: (i) management's turnaround plan is starting to bear fruit, with positive momentum building in ITV studios, broadcasting and online; (ii) in the longer term, new online aggregators like Netflix and Lovefilm should offer incremental opportunities to monetise ITV's TV content, which is not yet factored into our forecasts; (iii) with a net cash balance sheet, we see scope for ITV to reweight its business mix in favour of TV production by acquisition; (iv) without M&amp;A, there is scope to enhance earnings with a share buyback; and (v) current earnings are depressed by \u00a325m per annum (or around 6%) of Transformation Plan spend which we fully expense but assume no associated revenues. </blockquote> <p>Earlier in the week there were vague rumours that ITV could be in the sights of a predator, with Apple again one name mentioned.</p> <p>Among the FTSE 250 risers was textile services business <strong>Berendsen</strong>, up 38p to 500p, after profits rose from \u00a397.1m to \u00a3111.8m.</p> <p>The day's biggest riser was <strong>Oxford Advanced Surfaces</strong>, up 65% at 13.25p. The company has delivered samples of its anti-reflective coatings for LCD displays to a number of manufacturers, as foreshadowed here on Thursday. An overhang of stock was said to have been cleared out at 10p a share.</p> <p>Finally <strong>Alberta Coal Corporation</strong>, a thermal coal exploration and development company with assets in Canada, begins marketing next week for a main market flotation expected in a couple of weeks. The company wants to raise \u00a330 million and is expected to have a market capitalisation of around \u00a360m.

The country also has to finalise agreement with its private bondholders about exchanging their debt for lower value paper, which it hopes to do by 12 March. In the US positive housing and consumer sentiment figures pushed the Dow Jones Industrial Average above 13,000 for the second time in a week. Lloyds Banking Group was the leading loser in the top index yesterday, down 0.845p to 35.73p after it announced a \u00a33.5bn loss and expressed caution about the outlook. Royal Bank of Scotland, which reported its own losses on Thursday, slipped 0.19p to 28.53p. Growing tensions with Iran and the threat of supply disruption sent crude prices higher, with Brent moving above $124 a barrel and recording its fifth consecutive weekly gain. The news supported oil company shares with BP up 0.85p at 496.2p ahead of the start of a court case next week relating to the Gulf of Mexico disaster. Cove Energy jumped 40.25p to 235p after Thai state owned oil and gas group PTT made a 220p a share offer for East Africa focused explorer, trumping an earlier 195p a share offer from Royal Dutch Shell, down 6.5p to \u00a323.22. A number of bidders had been rumoured, with an earlier report in this column predicting that offers could top 200p a share, so further developments cannot be ruled out. Other oil companies in the area moved higher as investors looked for the next target, with Ophir Energy in particular demand, up 51p to 426p yesterday. Elsewhere Capita climbed 29.5p to 747.5p as a number of analysts upgraded the outsourcing group following its better than expected full year results. Investors had been concerned it was not winning enough new work, but it has announced a couple of deals in the last few days including a British army recruitment contract. Hammerson was up 14.4p at 400.1p after it reported a 7% rise in net assets and unveiled plans to sell its entire office portfolio to concentrate on retail. ITV added 2.3p to 80.1p ahead of results next week, on hopes of a cash return to shareholders. Omar Sheikh at Credit Suisse issued an outperform recommendation on the broadcaster, saying: We remain bullish on ITV given: (i) management's turnaround plan is starting to bear fruit, with positive momentum building in ITV studios, broadcasting and online; (ii) in the longer term, new online aggregators like Netflix and Lovefilm should offer incremental opportunities to monetise ITV's TV content, which is not yet factored into our forecasts; (iii) with a net cash balance sheet, we see scope for ITV to reweight its business mix in favour of TV production by acquisition; (iv) without M&amp;A, there is scope to enhance earnings with a share buyback; and (v) current earnings are depressed by \u00a325m per annum (or around 6%) of Transformation Plan spend which we fully expense but assume no associated revenues. Earlier in the week there were vague rumours that ITV could be in the sights of a predator, with Apple again one name mentioned. Among the FTSE 250 risers was textile services business Berendsen, up 38p to 500p, after profits rose from \u00a397.1m to \u00a3111.8m. The day's biggest riser was Oxford Advanced Surfaces, up 65% at 13.25p. The company has delivered samples of its anti-reflective coatings for LCD displays to a number of manufacturers, as foreshadowed here on Thursday. An overhang of stock was said to have been cleared out at 10p a share. Finally Alberta Coal Corporation, a thermal coal exploration and development company with assets in Canada, begins marketing next week for a main market flotation expected in a couple of weeks. The company wants to raise \u00a330 million and is expected to have a market capitalisation of around \u00a360m. The chief executive is John Hogg, who previously helped build up Western Coal from a $50m business to a $3.3bn capitalised company.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A pre-Christmas shopping spree and an unexpected rise in government spending came to the economy's rescue in the last three months of 2011, but it was not enough to prevent the wider British economy from contracting. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) confirmed its estimate today, indicating that the UK economy shrank by 0.2%, despite a 0.5% rise in household spending and a 4% annual rise in consumption by the government. Several economists cheered the figures, which they said could prevent a double dip recession. But Paul Fisher, a Bank of England policymaker, said the outlook for the British economy was still very uncertain and he was keeping an open-minded as to whether more quantitative easing would be required. Fisher said a steeply rising oil price was a potential hindrance to growth this year. He said a rise in the price of oil, which has risen 11% over the last month, could spur inflation again and derail the recovery. Brent crude, which reached record highs this week in sterling and euros, jumped another $1 to $124.74 after the United Nation's nuclear watchdog said Iran has sharply stepped up work on uranium enrichment, raising traders' fears of an attack against Opec's second largest producer. Ed Balls, shadow chancellor, said the ONS data revealed an underlying weakness in the government's recovery plans after the big fall in business investment. He said: \"The case for a change of course and a real plan for jobs and growth in next month's budget is growing by the day.\" The ONS added to concerns that the economy remains weak by nudging down the previous estimate for third-quarter growth, from 0.6% to 0.5%. As a result, overall growth during 2011 looked a shade more anaemic at 0.8%, down from previous estimates of 0.9%. Should the economy not return to growth in this quarter, Britain would again be in an official recession (defined as two consecutive quarters of contraction). Recent economic data \u2013 in the services sector, as well as manufacturing and retail sales \u2013 suggest the economy is showing signs of a rebound. The quarter-on-quarter rise in household spending during the fourth quarter marked the first increase in 18 months, though the figure was down 0.6% compared with the same period a year earlier. Government spending rose by 1% and exports jumped by 2.3% on the quarter. The overall fall in GDP was largely driven by the biggest drop in business investment for a year, while the production sector, which includes manufacturing, declined 1.4% compared with previous estimates of 1.2%. The annual figure for consumer spending was also lacklustre, leaving the government to pick up the slack. Alan Clarke, an economist at Scotia Capital, was upbeat about the prospects for the beginning of 2012, citing a bounceback in consumer spending as positive news. He said the government spending figures would encourage people to ask \"austerity, what austerity?\" But Ross Walker, an RBS economist, called the 0.2% contraction \"a pretty poor number\". He said: \"The main positive is that improvements in survey data that look increasingly broad-based have not been captured, and we will get a bounce back in the first quarter [of 2012] \u2026 I don't think it will be a spectacular first quarter but I think we will squeeze some growth out of it. \"Since George Osborne's spending review the economy has grown by just 0.2% compared to the 3% the government predicted. And far from the eurozone crisis being to blame, only rising exports kept us out of recession last year. In the US, where the government has taken a more balanced and steady approach to deficit reduction, their economy has more than recovered all the output lost in the global recession, while in Britain we are still almost 4% below our pre-crisis peak.\" When the worse-than-expected fourth-quarter figures were first published in January, David Cameron admitted they were disappointing but insisted there was \"not an ounce of complacency\" as the government sought to get Britain back on track. Facing mounting pressure to temper spending cuts to restore growth, the chancellor, George Osborne, stuck to his guns, saying: \"I think we've got the right plan; we've got to stick to it.\"",

Hammerson currently owns an array of office property in the City and West End of London, including two 26-storey towers. The portfolio was last valued at \u00a3528m.The developer will now concentrate on retail investments and adding to the range of outlets it already owns, such as Brent Cross in London, the Bullring in Birmingham, and Cabot Circus in Bristol. It also owns retail centres in France and is currently building a major shopping and leisure complex in Marseille, which is due to open in 2014. Chief executive David Atkins denied the decision was a kneejerk reaction to the worsening London office market. \"It is really setting the direction of the company over the next few years,\" he said. JP Morgan's property analyst Harm Meijer welcomed the move: \"This improves the company's investment focus (to retail) and we regard Hammerson's management as one of the best retail managers in the sector.\" Hammerson's shares climbed 4% to 400p. Hammerson will sell its existing offices in London, but will hold on to developments that are in the pipeline, such as Principal Place near Liverpool St station. The company believes it can probably get more cash from selling its office buildings individually, although is open to selling them as a package, Atkins said. At the same time, Hammerson wants to beef up its presence in the UK and France and did not rule out entering other European countries. \"Following the review of our strategy we will focus on being the best owner-manager and developer of retail property within Europe,\" said Atkins. \"We now intend to sell our standing office investments over the medium term to maximise returns, redeploying capital into the retail sector to exploit our expertise and build on our existing scale.\" Another City scheme, the \u00a3800m Pinnacle, has come to a halt again as the developer, Arab Investments, failed to secure a pre-let, a key condition to obtaining further funding from its lenders, which include HSBC. Property consultancy EC Harris warned this week that 150 planned office projects in London are at risk from the eurozone crisis.",

But the austerity plan and problems in the eurozone will create obstacles for the economy, which is why the government must place growth at the top of its agenda.</p> <p>Priorities must be reallocated within the overall spending envelope, with greater emphasis on policies to boost growth. With total borrowing in the current financial year likely to be around \u00a38bn below the OBR's estimate in November, we believe that the chancellor can increase spending in the budget by some \u00a34bn while still maintaining market credibility.

      "bodyText": "Official figures, released on Friday, confirmed that the economy slipped by 0.2% in the fourth quarter. This is what economists made of the numbers: David Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce There was a significant fall in investment over the quarter, which was disappointing \u2013 but consumer spending rose 0.5% and there was a large improvement in net trade. Although the UK economy faces many challenges, we believe it has returned to positive growth in the first quarter of the year and a recession will be avoided. But the austerity plan and problems in the eurozone will create obstacles for the economy, which is why the government must place growth at the top of its agenda. Priorities must be reallocated within the overall spending envelope, with greater emphasis on policies to boost growth. With total borrowing in the current financial year likely to be around \u00a38bn below the OBR's estimate in November, we believe that the chancellor can increase spending in the budget by some \u00a34bn while still maintaining market credibility. He should use this flexibility to implement policies that will enable businesses to create jobs and drive recovery.

In a statement, the retailer said it had decided to withdraw from a \"mandatory work programme\" while the government clarified its position on the scheme, but said it would continue to offer voluntary work experience as part of a separate initiative. \"We have taken recent findings about the mandatory work programme candidates very seriously and with further investigation have decided to withdraw from the initiative,\" said the company's chief executive, Jim McCarthy.

Several other companies, including Waterstones, Sainsbury's and TK Maxx, have withdrawn from the scheme. Poundland has come in for particular attention since lawyers for a woman who completed three weeks of unpaid work experience in its Birmingham store claimed the placement had been contrary to human rights legislation on forced labour and thus breached her human rights. Cait Reilly, 22, brought her case against the DWP, which strongly disputes her claims but admits it made a mistake by not telling Reilly she had the right to opt out of the placement.
