It\u2019s about going backwards and forwards, pushing and pushing,\u201d says Obie Campbell, a Hula Hoop spinning around her waist. In a jazzy majorette uniform of hotpants and knee socks, Campbell is not coaxing five-year-olds in a school gym: she\u2019s coaching shoppers in London\u2019s trendy Old Spitalfields Market. The display is part of an all-singing, all-dancing weekend shopping jamboree organised by notonthehighstreet.com. Like a virtual version of the famous London market, notonthehighstreet provides a platform for professional designers and makers, from potters to woodcarvers to gastronomes, to sell their wares, with commission charged per transaction. The online marketplace has temporarily commandeered some space in Spitalfields as it dips its toe in the treacherous waters of bricks-and-mortar retailing. The experiment follows last year\u2019s appointment of the company\u2019s first external chief executive, Simon Belsham, whose previous job was running the grocery home shopping business of retail giant Tesco. \u201cI think retail is always going to be about online and offline together,\u201d he says, using the jargon of an internet retail expert: \u201coffline\u201d means old-fashioned shops to the rest of us. \u201cThis event is about opening our doors to customers and giving them a physical, tactile experience of our products.\u201d There is an emerging trend of internet retailers opening real-world shops. Amazon opened its first store last year while British fashion website Missguided will soon make its debut in the Westfield Stratford City mall in London. Notonthehighstreet is part of the so-called Silicon-upon-Thames tech set: its head office is in the well-heeled riverside London suburb of Richmond, where its neighbours include eBay and PayPal and mail-order snack kings Graze. Belsham is yet to decide whether expansion into stores is the right path for the company. \u201cI don\u2019t know yet,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019ll learn a lot from this weekend. Physical [shops] is going to be an important part of Notonthehighstreet.\u201d Campbell\u2019s hula-hoop coaching is one of the activities offered by The Indytute, which offers \u201cbrilliantly inspired lessons\u201d and experiences through notonthehighstreet. It is one of 5,000 sellers on the 10-year-old website, which racked up sales of \u00a3156m from January through December 2015. But if City gossip is to be believed, the company is jumping through different kinds of hoops, which could lead to a stock market flotation. Despite the looming EU referendum, there still appears to be investor appetite for new retail stocks, with fashion retailer Joules and confectioner Hotel Chocolat confirming details of listings last week. The online marketplace was founded by entrepreneurs Holly Tucker and Sophie Cornish from Tucker\u2019s London kitchen table in April 2006. But there was a changing of the guard last year with the appointment of 37-year-old Belsham, who has a Harvard MBA under his belt. It also hired the experienced Darren Shapland as chairman. Shapland also chairs Poundland, and was previously finance director of Sainsbury\u2019s. Belsham has retail in his blood: his parents ran the local toyshop, Scally Wags Fun Factory, in his home town of Ashford, Middlesex. \u201cI grew up on the shop floor,\u201d he jokes. \u201cMy brother and I were allowed to choose a Star Wars figure every week when they went to the wholesaler.\u201d The shop closed in the 80s when Toys R Us arrived, but Belsham says: \u201cIt gave me an insight into the highs and lows of running a small business.\u201d Notonthehighstreet services a growing demand for unique products in the face of a commoditised retail environment. \u201cOur partners are investing in their businesses and bringing back heritage skills,\u201d says Belsham. \u201cI was in Wales when the headlines were about steel and lack of employment in Port Talbot. I was visiting a partner called Dust and Things, which makes fabulous wooden products. They joined us a year ago and have gone from nothing to become one of our bigger partners, employing five people in quite a tough part of Wales. \u201cThat\u2019s what makes this business different, the uniqueness of the product and the professionalism of our partners,\u201d he adds. Cornish and Tucker, who remain shareholders, now have non-executive roles, working a couple of days a month. Tucker has the alarmingly American-sounding job title of \u201cchief inspirator\u201d. Cornish says she does not see the handover as \u201cletting go\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m as committed to the business as I ever was,\u201d she explains. \u201cOf course we are founders, so remain incredibly involved in the business at heart, but it\u2019s great that we have got such a fantastic management team.\u201d The appointment of a high-profile chairman by a private company \u2013 and the hiring of a heavyweight City PR firm \u2013 is often a precursor to a stock market listing or sale. So far the company has raised around \u00a327m from investors, most recently in 2012, when it attracted \u00a310m from a consortium that included Fidelity, Index Ventures and Greylock Partners. Belsham is cagey about speculation linking it to a fresh round of fundraising. \u201cWe are well funded today and have got great support from our existing investors,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019ve got opportunities to grow and will invest in that growth where we see a good return on that investment. We\u2019ve got no immediate plans to IPO but we\u2019d never rule out any source of fundraising.\u201d Investors were due to tour the event and while they might have passed on the chance to make their own pom-pom keyring, they might see merit in bankrolling the company\u2019s expansion. The most recent accounts show losses widening to \u00a35.5m, after an unsuccessful foray into Germany, but one City analyst says that will not deter backers if it is able to map out a clear path to profitability. \u201cThere\u2019s a price for everything, so it would depend what price they are looking for,\u201d the analyst says.",

      "bodyText": "Research by The Australia Institute reveals that the electorate which would benefit the most from the tax cut for people earning more than $80,000 is the prime minister\u2019s own of Wentworth. But while the fact that Malcolm Turnbull lives in a pretty well-heeled area is no great surprise, the research highlights that far from $80,000 being the income of middle Australia, just 14% of Australians earn more than that. The decision to increase the threshold for the second highest tax bracket from $80,000 to $87,000 has been sold by the government as a tax break for \u201cmiddle Australia\u201d. On Thursday, the Turnbull government told ABC\u2019s Fran Kelly that the tax cut was designed to ensure that \u201cmiddle income Australians, those that are on average full-time earnings \u2026 don\u2019t move into the second top tax bracket\u201d. Except middle income is not average income and full-time earnings also exclude nearly a third of workers who work part-time or casual. Map: percentage of people earning greater than $80,000 When talking about the average Australian, politicians would love to have you think it means the same thing as the median \u2013 that halfway point. The problem is that those on very high incomes skew the average income level much higher than the median point. The most recent data from the Australian Tax Office for 2013-14 revealed that rather than being the income of middle Australia, just 25% of those with a taxable income earned more than $80,000. But that data excludes the many adults who don\u2019t file tax returns \u2013 including those on pensions. The Australian Institute, using the most recent census data extrapolated to 2015, has found that only 14% of all income-earning Australians earn more than $80,000. It found, not surprisingly, that inner-city electorates were those with the highest numbers of people earning more than $80,000. While Turnbull\u2019s seat was no 1 on the list, Scott Morrison\u2019s seat of Cook came 25th: But the figures highlight that even in Wentworth, $80,000 does not represent \u201cthe middle\u201d. Just over a third of those living in the seat \u2013 34.4% \u2013 earn enough to put them into the second highest tax bracket, and just 19.7% in Morrison\u2019s seat of Cook. You could make the case that the tax cut will mostly benefit Liberal party electorates \u2013 given 18 of the 25 electorates with the greatest percentage of people earning more than $80,000 are held by the LNP. However on the counter is the fact that half the 25 electorates with the lowest proportion of people earning more than that level are also held by LNP members \u2013 mostly because of rural electorates such as Mallee in Victoria, and Cowper and Page in New South Wales, which are held by the National party. The situation in the marginal seats also suggests that there is little electoral advantage for either side on the issue. About half the 25 most marginal seats have a lower percentage than the national average: The data, however, confirms that the tax cuts are targeted towards the higher end of the income spectrum rather than the middle \u2013 especially alongside the decision to allow the 2% point \u201cdeficit levy\u201d for those earning above $180,000 to lapse at the end of next financial year. What has also been largely ignored is that the cuts are far more targeted towards men than women. In 2013-14, the number of men who earned more than $80,000 far exceeded the number of women in that category: Only about 17% of women who had a taxable income in 2013-14 earned more than $80,000 compared with 33% of men. This is largely because men are more likely to work full-time and also (as I have noted previously) on average earn more than women in various jobs because of not having to take time off during pregnancy \u2013 or because they are the ones more likely to work part-time while their children are young. Thus, even when talking of average full-time workers, Turnbull and Morrison are really talking about men. The current average full-time earnings for men, at $87,600, is 25% higher than the $69,846 average for women full-time workers. The average for all male workers, at $71,453, is 50% higher than the average earnings of $47,595 for women. As a general rule, average full-time earnings are higher than average total earnings, which are higher than median earnings: But even among men, the median income is well below the $80,000 mark. In 2013-14, the median male earnings of $61,032 had such workers a long way from worrying about bracket creep taking them above $80,000. At the current wages growth rate of 2.2%, they can expect to be earning more than $80,000 by 2028. That said, the ratio of the current second highest tax threshold to earnings is lower than it has been for a decade: But while the average full-time earnings are certainly now below the second highest tax bracket for the first time since 1999 (before the tax cuts that occurred with the GST introduction), the figures from the Australia Institute reinforce that when the prime minister or treasurer talk about people earning more than $80,000, in no way are they talking about middle Australia \u2013 not even in their own very wealthy electorates.",

About half the 25 most marginal seats have a lower percentage than the national average:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"3\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/yddzd/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe>\u00a0 </figure>  <p>The data, however, confirms that the tax cuts are targeted towards the higher end of the income spectrum rather than the middle \u2013 especially alongside the decision to allow the 2% point \u201cdeficit levy\u201d for those earning above $180,000 to lapse at the end of next financial year.</p> <p>What has also been largely ignored is that the cuts are far more targeted towards men than women.</p> <p>In 2013-14, the number of men who earned more than $80,000 far exceeded the number of women in that category:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"4\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/K78ja/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe>\u00a0 </figure>  <p>Only about 17% of women who had a taxable income in 2013-14 earned more than $80,000 compared with 33% of men.</p> <p>This is largely because men are more likely to work full-time and also (as I have noted previously) on average earn more than women in various jobs because of not having to take time off during pregnancy \u2013 or because they are the ones more likely to work part-time while their children are young.</p> <p>Thus, even when talking of average full-time workers, Turnbull and Morrison are really talking about men.</p> <p>The current average full-time earnings for men, at $87,600, is 25% higher than the $69,846 average for women full-time workers. The average for all male workers, at $71,453, is 50% higher than the average earnings of $47,595 for women. As a general rule, average full-time earnings are higher than average total earnings, which are higher than median earnings:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"5\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/LJsUL/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe>\u00a0 </figure>  <p>But even among men, the median income is well below the $80,000 mark. In 2013-14, the median male earnings of $61,032 had such workers a long way from worrying about bracket creep taking them above $80,000.</p> <p>At the current wages growth rate of 2.2%, they can expect to be earning more than $80,000 by 2028.</p> <p>That said, the ratio of the current second highest tax threshold to earnings is lower than it has been for a decade:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"6\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/5y2eF/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe>\u00a0 </figure>  <p>But while the average full-time earnings are certainly now below the second highest tax bracket for the first time since 1999 (before the tax cuts that occurred with the GST introduction), the figures from the Australia Institute reinforce that when the prime minister or treasurer talk about people earning more than $80,000, in no way are they talking about middle Australia \u2013 not even in their own very wealthy electorates.</p>",
