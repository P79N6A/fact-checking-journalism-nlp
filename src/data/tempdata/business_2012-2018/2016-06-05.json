      "bodyText": "A big pick-up in high skilled jobs helped Yorkshire and the Humber record the fastest employment growth in the UK last year, according to a report that will be a welcome boost to George Osborne\u2019s \u201cnorthern powerhouse\u201d agenda. Analysis of official figures by economists at NatWest found Yorkshire and the Humber enjoyed employment growth of 3.7% last year, almost twice the UK rate of 2%. That helped make up for some of the post-crisis slump in the region and meant there were now 5% more jobs there compared with the start of the global financial crash in 2008. The strongest employment recovery over 2008 to 2015 was in London, followed by the east of England. Yorkshire and the Humber was in third place, NatWest said in its latest regional economic tracker. The bank\u2019s senior economist Sebastian Burnside highlighted the promising nature of the jobs growth in the region. \u201cBehind this success is a 6.2% surge in high-skilled jobs over the last year, more than offsetting a small fall in low skilled employment. As the labour market changes and technology becomes ever more important it is reassuring to see the region continuing to generate high quality jobs and benefit from the higher wages they tend to attract,\u201d he said. For the UK as a whole, there had been a 12.5% increase in highly skilled jobs such as doctors and nurses, lawyers, accountants, teachers, managers and directors since 2008, the report found. Over the same period there had been a small drop in the number of people employed in low-skilled jobs, including retail assistants, cleaners and call centre staff. Burnside said the pattern of employment growth reflected the rise of technology in workplaces. \u201cGreater use of technology is improving the efficiency of many retail operations, the replacement of check-out staff with automated tills is one of the most visible ways this is happening and has contributed to the number of people employed as cashiers falling by over 70,000 since 2008,\u201d he said. The chancellor will be cheered by signs in this report that some of those lost low-skilled jobs are being replaced with higher skilled roles, particularly in parts of what he has dubbed a northern powerhouse. A report last week criticised the government\u2019s northern plans for placing too little focus on improving the performance of individual cities. The Centre for Cities thinktank said Osborne\u2019s push to bridge the economic gap between the wealthier south and the poorer north was too heavily focused on intercity transport links. While ministers and local authorities will welcome this new report on high-skilled jobs growth in region, such analyses reveal little about how individuals fare when their roles are replaced by technology. As such, the NatWest figures are unlikely to dim calls from trade unions for better training and adult education to help workers adjust to changing employer needs. But Burnside said the growth in skilled jobs still provided some encouragement that in the labour market battle between man and machine, the humans could win out as demand in new areas of the economy creates new opportunities. \u201cThis longer view is encouraging ... It\u2019s another example of just how incredibly flexible the UK\u2019s labour market is,\u201d he said. NatWest said different parts of the UK had enjoyed varied success in creating high-skilled jobs. For example, high-skilled London jobs were up 19.2% since 2008, and in the north west they had grown 11.7%. The north east of England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland were the only regions not to enjoy double-digit growth. Despite the apparent overall UK pick-up in higher skilled jobs, pay growth has remained relatively weak. The Bank of England has suggested several explanations for lacklustre earnings growth, including a drop in average hours worked, the fact much of the employment growth has been in industries that typically pay less and the possibility that low inflation means employers feel less obliged to offer substantial pay rises. More recently, business surveys have suggested companies are nervous about hiring new workers and raising pay as they adjust to new costs from the \u201cnational living wage\u201d introduced in April and as they await the outcome of this month\u2019s EU referendum. The latest official labour market figures showed that in the three months to March earnings, excluding bonuses, grew 2.1% on a year earlier, down from 2.2% in the three months to February.",

Accountancy firm BDO reports that company investment is flatlining, forcing them to rein in their hiring plans. It fears that economic growth could fall sharply unless firms bolster their investment plans later this year. Peter Hemington, a partner at BDO, says Brexit uncertainty has cast a long shadow over the economy and that growth expectations among UK companies have now fallen for the 10th month in a row. \u201cPrivate sector capital investment has been sluggish throughout this recovery, and recent official figures show sharp falls \u2013 no doubt related to Brexit fears. This fall has no doubt contributed to UK businesses\u2019 expectation that economic growth will fall behind its long term trend for the first time in nearly three years,\u201d said Hemington. The BDO\u2019s output index \u2013 a measure of orders that firms have on hand \u2013 slumped to 99.7 last month, from 100.6 in April. This is the first time since September 2013 that it has fallen below 100, a level consistent with UK long-term trend growth at around 2%. Hemington hopes that businesses will increase investment once the referendum is concluded. Otherwise, growth and productivity could suffer, with a knock-on effect on the labour market. Investors around the globe are watching the 23 June vote with growing concern, in the light of recent warnings that Brexit would hurt the world economy. Some 85% of European private equity and real estate firms hope that the remain campaign wins this month\u2019s vote, according to a survey by industry group Augentius. That figure falls to 73% in the UK, where two thirds of companies said the result was either \u201cimportant\u201d or \u201cvery important\u201d to their business. Investors are also taking steps to protect themselves if Britain votes to quit the EU. Commercial property investors are demanding clauses giving them the right to walk away from real estate deals, in the event of the leave campaign winning, according to Reuters. These measures are particularly common with larger property deals. \u201c(Investors) fear that the value and return on investment properties may decline and that it may not be as good an investment if Britain withdraws from the EU,\u201d explained Paul Firth, head of real estate at law firm Irwin Mitchell. The International Monetary Fund warned last month that property prices would be hit by Brexit, and prime minister David Cameron claimed on Sunday that mortgage rates would rise. The Leave campaign, though, say asset prices will not fall if Britain chooses to leave the EU.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "British industry continues to crawl along the road to recovery with output and orders still sliding and investment at its lowest level since the financial crisis, according to an industry report. The EEF\u2019s latest manufacturing survey found that the 23 June EU referendum, which has been holding back other sectors of the economy, notably construction, is just one factor among many uncertainties. The manufacturers\u2019 organisation also pointed to the difficult global economy, cutbacks in oil and gas investment and the steel crisis. Investment is the lowest since 2009. But there are signs that the downturn has bottomed out, with firms growing more confident about the coming months. That could lead to a recovery in the second half of this year, the EEF believes, if the UK chooses to remain in the EU and \u201cother factors holding back growth continue to wane\u201d. The poll of 346 companies showed that output and orders fell in the past three months, for the fourth quarter running. Both balances improved, albeit not as much as expected, to -4% from -5% for output and to -2% from -8% for total orders in the second quarter, bolstering hopes that manufacturing could move into positive territory in the second half of the year. Some sectors have fared better than the rest, such as chemicals, pharmaceuticals and transport, which are still growing. The UK and export order balances improved to -8% and -4% respectively. Europe remained the market where most manufacturers reported positive demand, followed by North America and the Middle East. Businesses are now planning to hire for the first time in three quarters, although this is concentrated in a few sectors. The bright spots were the food and drink industries \u2013 which, the EEF said, are benefiting from an easing in the supermarket price war \u2013 along with the chemicals and electrical equipment sectors. Official figures out on Wednesday are expected to show no growth in manufacturing in April, following a 0.1% rise in March, according to a Reuters poll of economists. The EEF expects that the sector will be broadly flat this year after the 2015 decline, when several steel factories closed and plummeting oil prices forced BP and Shell to make big cutbacks. The organisation lowered its forecasts, to a 0.1% fall for output this year, from a previously estimated rise of 0.6% (last year it fell by 0.3%). However, a better second half is expected to carry through to growth of 1.2% next year. The EEF\u2019s GDP estimates remain unchanged at 1.9% this year and 2.2% in 2017. The EEF\u2019s chief economist, Lee Hopley, said: \u201cDemand conditions in manufacturing at least seem to be heading the right direction, but the climb back to growth is still being challenged by the sluggish global economy and subdued investment at home.\u201d Another report on business trends, from business advisers BDO, found that the EU referendum had put a pause on both investment and hiring decisions. BDO\u2019s output index dipped to 99.7, marking the first first time since 2013 that it has fallen below the 100 level that indicates UK long-term economic trend growth of about 2%. Peter Hemington, partner at BDO, said: \u201cIn the end, investment drives productive capacity, growth and living standards. After the referendum, we must see businesses starting to invest or we face a worrying future.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Retail Acquisitions, the former owner of BHS, pledged to keep all funds in the business and plough any proceeds from the sale of the group\u2019s properties into its day-to-day running until a deal had been struck on the future of the BHS pension scheme, the Guardian understands. Documents sent to the parliamentary inquiry into the demise of BHS, which administrators are now winding down with the likely loss of 11,000 jobs, are understood to reveal three protective covenants attached to the sale agreement with Sir Philip Green\u2019s Arcadia Group, which sold BHS to Dominic Chappell\u2019s Retail Acquisitions for \u00a31 a year before it collapsed. The sales agreement between Retail Acquisitions and Arcadia Group will be published by the work and pensions committee on Monday morning. The first covenant states that \u201call monies in or available to BHS at completion\u201d of the deal, including cash and loans provided by Arcadia Group, \u201cshall be used for the sole purpose of the day-to-day running of [BHS]\u201d, informed sources said. A second states that \u201call proceeds realised by [BHS] from the sale of the properties shall be retained by [BHS] and used for the sole purpose of the day-to-day running of the business of [BHS]\u201d until a compromise agreement on the company\u2019s pension funds had been agreed. The final clause states that \u201cno steps are taken by the buyer or [BHS] that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect the ability of [BHS] to continue to operate as a going concern and to pay their debts as they fall due\u201d. Paul Budge, Arcadia\u2019s finance director, said the group had put the covenants in place because it \u201cdidn\u2019t want to give [Retail Acquisitions] wriggle room to take money out of BHS\u201d. Green has been heavily criticised for selling the business to the little-known group of entrepreneurs led by Chappell. Details of the covenants were sent to the parliamentary inquiry by Arcadia just days before Chappell is due to give evidence on why the business was forced to call in administrators in April leaving a \u00a3571m pension deficit. Chappell, who will go to parliament on Wednesday, will be asked to explain why his group was paid \u00a325m from BHS in the 13 months it controlled the retailer before it went bust. That included \u00a32.8m in management fees, \u00a32.1m in salaries and wages, \u00a311m in legal and professional fees and \u00a310m in interest payments. The former bankrupt is personally understood to have received about \u00a31.5m from an \u00a38.4m loan taken out of BHS by its new owners in March last year just days after buying the struggling department store chain. Retail Acquisitions has said it put \u00a310m into BHS. The payments will be closely scrutinised by two parliamentary inquiries which are looking into how money flowed out of BHS under Retail Acquisitions\u2019 ownership and during its 15-year stewardship by Green, who also faces criticism. The Green family and fellow shareholders received more than \u00a3580m in dividends, rental payments and interest on loans to help fund a lavish lifestyle. It emerged on Sunday that several months after selling BHS, Green\u2019s Arcadia Group agreed to pay \u00a310m to Retail Acquisitions. Arcadia says the money was part of the final settlement of the deal to sell BHS to Retail Acquisitions, a normal part of settling up a major transaction. Budge said the money had been paid directly to BHS\u2019s bank, HSBC, and not to Chappell\u2019s buyout group, in order to settle an overdraft facility. Green and Chappell have both blamed the other for the demise of BHS in an increasingly acrimonious dispute. Lord Myners, the former chairman of Marks &amp; Spencer and a former foe of Green, said it was \u201crather like giving the keys of your car to a five-year-old and allowing the five-year-old to go off and crash the car\u201d. Green is also under pressure to help support BHS\u2019s pension pot, which is being assessed by the Pension Protection Fund, because of a heavy funding deficit built up under his ownership. The entrepreneur, who will appear before the parliamentary inquiries on 15 June, is understood to be attempting to develop a plan to keep the BHS fund out of the Pension Protection Fund, under which members who are not already claiming their pension would suffer a 10% cut. The plan is likely to involve a cash injection alongside a reworking of Project Thor, a restructuring that Arcadia previously considered which involved buying out members of the pension scheme who had only worked for BHS for a few months and built up only small pension pots. They would only be entitled to a small payout eventually but offering them a cash lump sum instead would reduce the scheme\u2019s long-term liabilities. A spokesperson for the PPF said that it had not yet been approached with a new proposal and it is understood that the Pensions Regulator has not been approached either. A spokesman for the regulator said: \u201cOur anti-avoidance investigation continues and our chief executive has given a clear commitment that we will have made significant progress by the end of 2016. It\u2019s important that we do not prejudice this complex case and are able to progress it quickly. We are therefore not making any further comment at this time.\u201d Chappell did not respond to requests for comment.",

      "bodyText": "Mike Ashley will go before MPs to \u201cdefend the good name\u201d of Sports Direct on Tuesday in a change of plan just days after he said he would defy a parliamentary summons. The billionaire founder of the retail chain has written to the Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) committee to say that he had a change of heart after careful consideration over the weekend. On Friday MPs said they would discuss applying sanctions, which have not been brought to bear for decades, after Ashley said he could not make a long-planned meeting because his lawyer, Richard Gordon QC, was unavailable. In a letter to committee chairman Iain Wright headed \u201cNOTHING TO HIDE\u201d in bold capital letters, Ashley said: \u201cI am mindful of your statement to the press on Friday in which you question whether or not Sports Direct has anything to hide. \u201cI can assure you that nothing is further from the truth. I believe my repeated invitations for you to attend Shirebrook are a clear demonstration that in fact we have nothing to hide. I was merely seeking to avoid an unnecessary media circus. \u201cHowever, after much reflection over the last 48 hours, I have concluded that a lengthy legal battle would be of no benefit to either of us. It would also no doubt lead to further unwarranted accusations that I am being secretive, whereas in fact I have been open and honest at every stage of this process. \u201cI have therefore reconsidered my position and I am writing to confirm that I will now be attending parliament on Tuesday in order to defend the good name of Sports Direct on behalf of all of the great people who work here.\u201d Wright welcomed Ashley\u2019s decision to attend parliament. \u201cMr Ashley announced in December he would personally oversee a review of working practices at the Shirebrook warehouse in response to serious allegations made and we look forward to Mr Ashley answering our questions, including in response to these allegations and the progress of his review. As a committee, we want to get a sense of the genuine and balanced picture at Sports Direct and establish whether there are issues for the wider economy which need further examination, such as the status and rights of agency workers,\u201d he said. Ashley\u2019s decision to appear is the latest twist in a long-running battle with MPs, which began after a Guardian investigation revealed that thousands of the retailer\u2019s temporary warehouse workers were receiving effective hourly rates of pay below the minimum wage. In March, the tycoon was formally summoned to appear before the committee to explain his company\u2019s treatment of its workers, after refusing to agree to a number of dates suggested by MPs. Ashley dubbed the the parliamentarians \u201ca joke\u201d, claiming that they were showboating while he had the best interests of his employees at heart. He then suggested that MPs should visit the Shirebook warehouse first, to see conditions for themselves. The BIS committee declined that offer, insisting that Ashley report on 7 June. MPs want to quiz Ashley about the Guardian\u2019s revelation that thousands of Sports Direct workers were subjected to an extraordinary regime of searches and surveillance. Local teachers have warned that some pupils have been sent to school despite being ill, as parents who worked at Shirebrook have been afraid to take time off. Sports Direct responded to the reports by announcing a pay rise for its staff, as well as a review of all agency staff terms and conditions, which was to be overseen personally by Ashley. It is understood that Ashley feels he has now dealt with all the concerns raised about pay and conditions for staff at the Shirebrook head office and is keen to put the matter behind him. Iain Wright, BIS committee chairman, said on Friday that MPs were determined to investigate \u201cserious allegations of exploitative employment practice\u201d. \u201cMr Ashley announced in December he would personally oversee a review of working practices at the Shirebrook warehouse. It is entirely reasonable for the select committee to ask Mr Ashley to respond to those allegations and comment on how his review \u2013 announced over six months ago \u2013 is progressing,\u201d Wright added.",

I believe my repeated invitations for you to attend Shirebrook are a clear demonstration that in fact we have nothing to hide. I was merely seeking to avoid an unnecessary media circus. </p> <p>\u201cHowever, after much reflection over the last 48 hours, I have concluded that a lengthy legal battle would be of no benefit to either of us. It would also no doubt lead to further unwarranted accusations that I am being secretive, whereas in fact I have been open and honest at every stage of this process.</p> <p>\u201cI have therefore reconsidered my position and I am writing to confirm that I will now be attending parliament on Tuesday in order to defend the good name of Sports Direct on behalf of all of the great people who work here.\u201d </p> <p>Wright welcomed Ashley\u2019s decision to attend parliament. \u201cMr Ashley announced in December he would personally oversee a review of working practices at the Shirebrook warehouse in response to serious allegations made and we look forward to Mr Ashley answering our questions, including in response to these allegations and the progress of his review. As a committee, we want to get a sense of the genuine and balanced picture at Sports Direct and establish whether there are issues for the wider economy which need further examination, such as the status and rights of agency workers,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Ashley\u2019s decision to appear is the latest twist in a long-running battle with MPs, which began after a Guardian investigation revealed that thousands of the retailer\u2019s temporary warehouse workers were receiving effective hourly rates of pay <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/09/how-sports-direct-effectively-pays-below-minimum-wage-pay\">below the minimum wage</a>.</p> <p>In March, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/15/sports-directs-mike-ashley-to-be-formally-summoned-before-mps-business-committee-treatment-of-workers\">the tycoon was formally summoned to appear before the committee to explain his company\u2019s treatment of its workers</a>, after refusing to agree to a number of dates suggested by MPs.</p> <p>Ashley dubbed the the parliamentarians \u201ca joke\u201d, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/21/sports-direct-founder-mike-ashley-snubs-call-mps-parliamentary-select-committee\">claiming that they were showboating while he had the best interests of his employees at heart</a>.</p> <p>He then suggested that MPs should visit the Shirebook warehouse first, to see conditions for themselves. The BIS committee declined that offer, insisting that Ashley report on 7 June.</p> <p>MPs want to quiz Ashley about the Guardian\u2019s revelation that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/09/sports-direct-warehouse-work-conditions\">thousands of Sports Direct workers were subjected to an extraordinary regime of searches and surveillance</a>. Local teachers have warned that some pupils have been sent to school despite being ill, as parents who worked at Shirebrook have been afraid to take time off.</p> <p>Sports Direct responded to the reports by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/31/sports-direct-pledges-10m-towards-staff-pay-rise\">announcing a pay rise for its staff</a>, as well as a review of all agency staff terms and conditions, which was to be overseen personally by Ashley.</p> <p>It is understood that Ashley feels he has now dealt with all the concerns raised about pay and conditions for staff at the Shirebrook head office and is keen to put the matter behind him.</p> <p>Iain Wright, BIS committee chairman, said on Friday that MPs were determined to investigate \u201cserious allegations of exploitative employment practice\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cMr Ashley announced in December he would personally oversee a review of working practices at the Shirebrook warehouse. It is entirely reasonable for the select committee to ask Mr Ashley to respond to those allegations and comment on how his review \u2013 announced over six months ago \u2013 is progressing,\u201d Wright added.</p>",

M&amp;S\u2019s decision last week to ban piped music in its stores is his \u201cfirst major triumph in several years\u201d. Certainly, it was welcomed by Chris Olsson, 62, shopping at M&amp;S with her daughter Nellie Grand, 22. \u201cThank you, thank you,\u201d she tells Rodgers, as he explains Pipedown\u2019s campaign. \u201cI noticed something was different but didn\u2019t immediately know what it was.\u201d Olsson, from Sweden, prefers the silence. \u201cYes, it\u2019s good. Because in so many shops now there is music.\u201d She believes marketing experts think it boosts sales. \u201cIt will be interesting to see the figures,\u201d she says. And, while her daughter said she usually did not notice background music, \u201cif it is too loud I might leave the store. It depends on the store.\u201d It is more than 20 years since Rodgers \u2013 author, art historian and environmentalist, then in his 30s and dining with a girlfriend whom he was unable to hear over the loud background music \u2013 first determined to do something about muzak. His one-man mission has since burgeoned into an organisation with 1,500 UK members, whose early significant successes included Gatwick airport\u2019s decision to ban piped music in public areas. Today there are branches in Germany, Austria and plans for one in the US. Ten years ago, Rodgers and 40 or so of his members marched on Selfridges on Oxford Street after complaints to his organisation about the volume of background music. He managed to make a short speech before being bundled out by security. Today Selfridges is much improved, he notes, walking through its departments. Background music is evident only in certain areas, one being near the Levi jeans section in menswear, where David Alan, 66, from Toronto is browsing. \u201cI wish you\u2019d come to Toronto. It drives me crazy. It\u2019s outrageous there,\u201d he tells Rodgers. \u201cThere are some places I refuse to go into because the music is so loud. I think you\u2019re doing a great service to the citizens of Britain.\u201d Rodgers maintains there are real concerns about the acoustic wallpaper that is now part of everyday life, and that research indicates the majority of people don\u2019t want it. Many people with hearing and vision problems find it overwhelmingly distracting, as do some people with autism. Asda has introduced a \u201cquiet hour\u201d on Saturdays aimed at those with autism. \u201cThey even turn the escalators off, which I think is going a bit far,\u201d says Rodgers. Older people, too, are more distracted, with research in 2013 showing they hear background music louder, a condition known as presbycusis, and suffer noise nuisance on their hearing aids. Pipedown appears to be going from strength to strength. The name is catchy \u2013 albeit a little confusing in Scotland where members of the Edinburgh Pipedown branch must constantly be reassured it does not seek a ban on bagpipes. Its logo owes much to Edvard Munch\u2019s scream. An initial plan for an HMV-style dog looking at gramophone with a cork plugged in it was abandoned after tentative copyright approaches were met with a lawyer\u2019s letter several pages long from the company. Rodgers\u2019s ultimate ambition is for legislation to ban music in public areas of hospitals, where patients are trapped in their beds \u201cunable to escape\u201d the noisy hospital radio or TV. Complaints he has received from patients include: \u201cChemotherapy is bad enough without the blood-boiling irritation of muzak!\u201d Another, describing the \u201cdread, dread, dread\u201d of \u201cbloody TV soundtracks\u201d on his shared hospital ward, pleads: \u201cHeaven, please hear me and let my end come without music or TV.\u201d Christmas is the worst time, especially for staff. \u201cPoor sales staff may have to listen to Jingle Bells 300 times,\u201d said Rodgers. At Christmas in 2007, some Austrian shop workers sought compensation for suffering from the \u201cpsychological terror\u201d of piped music \u2013 Silent Night was a particular peeve. The city of Linz recently declared itself Beschallungsfrei \u2013 free of unwanted music. In Starbucks, on Charing Cross Road, as customers sip their lattes to a gentle background jazz medley, the volume is low enough for Carmen Brion, 40, to tolerate. Welcoming the Pipedown campaign, she tells Rodgers: \u201cI\u2019m highly sensitive. I have to really try hard to filter out loud music, which makes it difficult to talk over it. I think psychologists have started to recognise that some people are much more sensitive. We tend to be, maybe, more introvert. There have been times when I have just had to walk out of a shop because it is too loud. Camden market, it is bad there, as the music is just so loud.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "As life at BHS comes to an end for 11,000 frequently overlooked staff, who are now facing a future without a job or a fully funded pension scheme, attention remains on the men who owned the department store chain \u2013 plus those who profited as it collapsed. Guy and Alexander Dellal, the father and son behind the property company that helped to bankroll Dominic Chappell\u2019s takeover of BHS last year (and made a quick \u00a35m from a related property deal), are due to appear in front of MPs investigating the scandal on Tuesday, to be followed on Wednesday by Chappell (plus directors of his consortium and BHS management). No doubt someone will claim BHS\u2019s demise could not have been foreseen, although that is unlikely to be Neil Bennett, the mouthpiece of former BHS owner Sir Philip Green. In 2002, when he was at the Sunday Telegraph, Bennett interviewed Green two years after he\u2019d acquired the stores. \u201cBeing a billionaire is surely all about private jets and sumptuous yachts, about a long, languid tour of the world\u2019s most beautiful tropical beaches,\u201d Bennett mused. \u201cFor Philip Green, however, it is about ladieswear and merchandising, supply chains and sales per square foot. It is about 18-hour days, tortuous negotiations and endless cigarettes. Above all it is about loving an 80-year-old store chain called BHS to death.\u201d The man is a prophet. Ashley has got news for MPs: he\u2019s not turning up When you\u2019re expected on a panel, but fail to show up, it can prove disastrous. Just ask Roy Hattersley about Have I Got News For You. So on Tuesday, when the business, innovation and skills committee kicks off its investigation into the working practices of Sports Direct, one wonders what might be posited in the slot reserved for the group\u2019s founder Mike Ashley, who doesn\u2019t plan to be there. You\u2019ll recall that Ashley has form in this regard, having ducked a Scottish affairs committee last year by sending his clueless chairman, Keith Hellawell. Then, after repeatedly refusing invitations from committee chairman Iain Wright to give his side of an ongoing controversy about how the retailer treats its workers, Ashley received a summons. Having suggested he might then show up \u2013 but only on the ridiculous condition that MPs took a tour of his HQ first \u2013 Ashley declined. Hattersley, of course, cancelled three times \u2013 and always at the last minute \u2013 but was replaced by a tub of lard. In Ashley\u2019s corner we get representatives from the employment agencies who supply the retailer\u2019s warehouse staff. Courageously, the 55% owner of Sports Direct has encouraged them to attend. Sorrell could duck the pay question All of which means it is a good week to have the WPP annual general meeting, at least if your name is Sir Martin Sorrell. Events in parliament will ensure that, no matter how bad the protest gets over the size of the pay packet awarded to the advertising group\u2019s founder, Sorrell will be well down the list of the week\u2019s most hated businessmen. That is quite an achievement as the diminutive tycoon likes his rewards to come in inverse proportion to his physique (he stands five feet six and a half inches tall, which conveniently allows him to compare himself to Napoleon). Set that against the great man trousering some \u00a370.4m in 2015 \u2013 196 times the average WPP employee \u2013 and including variable pay that was 58 times his base salary of \u00a31.2m. Investor group Pirc reckons that sum has \u201cfar exceeded an acceptable ratio of 200% of salary\u201d. You\u2019ll therefore be amazed to learn that Pirc is recommending investors vote against WPP\u2019s pay report this week. Meanwhile, as the City\u2019s trickiest pub question remains: \u201cName a WPP director apart from Sorrell\u201d. Pirc is doing its bit to raise the profile of the rest, by advising a vote against the re-election of the chairman. That\u2019s Roberto Quarta, if you\u2019re interested.",

In 2002, when he was at the <em>Sunday Telegraph</em>, Bennett interviewed Green two years after he\u2019d acquired the stores. \u201cBeing a billionaire is surely all about private jets and sumptuous yachts, about a long, languid tour of the world\u2019s most beautiful tropical beaches,\u201d Bennett mused. \u201cFor Philip Green, however, it is about ladieswear and merchandising, supply chains and sales per square foot. It is about 18-hour days, tortuous negotiations and endless cigarettes. Above all it is about loving an 80-year-old store chain called BHS to death.\u201d</p> <p>The man is a prophet.</p> <h2>Ashley has got news for MPs: he\u2019s not turning up<br></h2> <p>When you\u2019re expected on a panel, but fail to show up, it can prove disastrous. Just ask Roy Hattersley about <em>Have I Got News For You</em>.</p> <p>So on Tuesday, when the business, innovation and skills committee kicks off its investigation into the working practices of Sports Direct, one wonders what might be posited in the slot reserved for the group\u2019s founder Mike Ashley, who doesn\u2019t plan to be there.</p> <p>You\u2019ll recall that Ashley has form in this regard, having ducked a Scottish affairs committee last year by sending his clueless chairman, Keith Hellawell. Then, after repeatedly refusing invitations from committee chairman Iain Wright to give his side of an ongoing controversy about how the retailer treats its workers, Ashley received a summons. Having suggested he might then show up \u2013 but only on the ridiculous condition that MPs took a tour of his HQ first \u2013 Ashley declined.</p> <p>Hattersley, of course, cancelled three times \u2013 and always at the last minute \u2013 but was replaced by a tub of lard. In Ashley\u2019s corner we get representatives from the employment agencies who supply the retailer\u2019s warehouse staff. Courageously, the 55% owner of Sports Direct has encouraged them to attend.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"04e6c19acdbac26d4df3d40da7dc3616a9b3e921\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/04e6c19acdbac26d4df3d40da7dc3616a9b3e921/0_103_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sir Martin Sorrell: well endowed with money.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sir Martin Sorrell: well endowed with money.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eamonn McCormack</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Sorrell could duck the pay question<br></h2> <p>All of which means it is a good week to have the WPP annual general meeting, at least if your name is Sir Martin Sorrell.</p> <p>Events in parliament will ensure that, no matter how bad the protest gets over the size of the pay packet awarded to the advertising group\u2019s founder, Sorrell will be well down the list of the week\u2019s most hated businessmen.</p> <p>That is quite an achievement as the diminutive tycoon likes his rewards to come in inverse proportion to his physique (he stands five feet six and a half inches tall, which conveniently allows him to compare himself to Napoleon). Set that against the great man trousering some \u00a370.4m in 2015 \u2013 196 times the average WPP employee \u2013 and including variable pay that was 58 times his base salary of \u00a31.2m. Investor group Pirc reckons that sum has \u201cfar exceeded an acceptable ratio of 200% of salary\u201d. You\u2019ll therefore be amazed to learn that Pirc is recommending investors vote against WPP\u2019s pay report this week.</p> <p>Meanwhile, as the City\u2019s trickiest pub question remains: \u201cName a WPP director apart from Sorrell\u201d. Pirc is doing its bit to raise the profile of the rest, by advising a vote against the re-election of the chairman. That\u2019s Roberto Quarta, if you\u2019re interested.</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Bank of England will draw on lessons learned from the Scottish referendum and the global financial crisis as it steps up its preparations for a possible decision by Britain to leave the EU on 23 June. The first of three special funding operations by Threadneedle Street will be launched on 14 June to ensure the UK\u2019s commercial banks have the necessary cash to cope with any turmoil caused by the uncertainty surrounding a Brexit vote. The move would be just the start of action by the Bank, which has drawn up a plan ready for use if necessary on 24 June if the UK votes to leave the EU. There would be emergency meetings of both the Bank\u2019s main decision-making bodies; the monetary policy committee that sets interest rates and the financial policy committee that is charged with ensuring there is no repeat of the near-meltdown that occurred during the banking crisis of eight years ago. Both bodies are chaired by the Bank\u2019s governor, Mark Carney, who would play a pivotal role as the government tried to convince jittery markets, nervous investors and the general public that it was in control of events. A key decision would be whether to raise interest rates in order to prevent a falling pound leading to higher inflation, or whether to ease policy \u2013 either through a cut in the cost of borrowing or through an expansion of the Bank\u2019s \u00a3375bn quantitative easing programme \u2013 to support growth. Speaking at a press conference to launch last month\u2019s inflation report, Carney said the decision could go either way. \u201cIn such circumstances [Brexit], the MPC would face a challenging trade-off between stabilising inflation on the one hand, and stabilising output and employment on the other. The implications for monetary policy would not be automatic; its direction would depend on the relative magnitudes of the demand, supply and exchange-rate effects.\u201d Threadneedle Street is now in pre-referendum purdah, but it has been working on its post-Brexit strategy since it became inevitable that Britain\u2019s 43-year-long relationship with the EU would be put to a vote. A year ago, an email sent in error to the Guardian exposed that a secret taskforce, named Project Bookend, had already been set up to consider the financial shocks from Brexit. In a repeat of the close scrutiny that took place during the turmoil that followed the collapse of Lehman Brothers, it is likely that individual banks will set up more regular reports for senior management about whether they are seeing big outflows from big companies and wealthy foreigners. Any banks thought to be in difficulties through no fault of their own will be able to tap unlimited quantities of cash provided by the Bank \u2013 and even those in good shape will be able to access the special funding. Through the Bank\u2019s regulation arm, the Prudential Regulation Authority, Carney is being kept abreast of plans by the big lenders to ensure they are prepared for the consequences of a Brexit vote. \u201cWe\u2019re not directing them what to do, but we\u2019re asking them what they are doing,\u201d Carney has said. Andrew Bailey, one of Carney\u2019s deputies who runs the PRA, told Reuters last month \u2013 more than a month before the referendum \u2013 that he was already in daily contact with lenders over Brexit planning. \u201cAll the banks are looking at this very actively,\u201d Bailey said. He also made clear that the Bank expected the three extra funding opportunities to be used. After the one next week on 14 June, there is another just before the vote, on 21 June. The week after the result, the Bank intends to offer more cash on 28 June. \u201cWe are open for business for banks that want to take up those operations,\u201d Bailey has said. Bailey is one of the few senior officials who was at the Bank during the financial and economic crisis that began in the summer of 2007 and resulted in Britain\u2019s longest postwar recession. All nine members of the MPC have changed since interest rates were last moved in March 2009, with the then governor Mervyn King stepping down in 2013. Bailey is himself scheduled to be leaving the Bank on 1 July \u2013 a week after the referendum \u2013 to head the City regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority. He will, however, continue to sit on the FPC and retain a seat on the PRA board. Carney has been keen to avoid the Bank being caught in a policy vacuum, as it was when the pound was bundled out of the exchange rate mechanism on Black Wednesday on 16 September 1992. On that occasion, the Bank and the Treasury had to rebuild a policy framework from scratch, and to avoid a repetition Carney has been laying out his plans for several months. One clear message is that cash will be available to banks ahead of the vote. \u201cOne of the lessons we learned from the Scottish experience was that it was better to announce potential liquidity facilities earlier to avoid sending a signal,\u201d Carney has said. By announcing the extra cash flows as long ago as March, Carney said he was hoping to avoid a situation in which the Bank announced a lending facility so close to the referendum. \u201cHowever harmless and prudent and careful that is, some people will interpret it as a signal of potential stress. So by announcing it months in advance \u2026 we think we\u2019ve avoided that and I think we have,\u201d the governor said. The Bank will also summon the assistance of other central banks \u2013 including the European Central Bank and the US Federal Reserve \u2013 to provide access to stocks of foreign currency in the event of a run on the pound, a course of action approved by the International Monetary Fund. \u201cThe Bank of England has appropriately announced plans to hold additional liquidity auctions in the weeks around the referendum,\u201d the IMF said. \u201cThere may also be a need to activate swap facilities with other major central banks in the event of a shortfall of foreign exchange liquidity.\u201d Lenders have given clues to how they are readying themselves for market turmoil. Tushar Morzaria, finance director of Barclays, has said the bank was being \u201ccareful in how we manage our liquidity pool\u201d. This will result in Barclays and other banks holding more cash than they might otherwise have done. Banks do not anticipate savers withdrawing their life savings \u2013 as was the fear at the time of the Scottish referendum \u2013 but they will be watching the activities of foreign companies. Savers will be reassured that their nest eggs are guaranteed at an EU-wide equivalent of \u20ac100,000 (\u00a378,000).",

      "bodyText": "Former Asda boss Andy Bond is upping his assault on the UK\u2019s discounter market with the opening of the first store in a new chain called GHM! on Tuesday. The clothing, homewares and groceries chain, whose three letters stand for Guess How Much!, will kick off in Hinckley, Leicestershire, with plans for at least five outlets by the end of the year. The second will open on the Isle of Sheppey, off the coast of Kent, next week. The new chain, which is run by Koray Gul, a former Asda executive, will include clothing areas from Pep &amp; Co, the chain that Bond launched nearly a year ago which now has 50 stores. Both are backed with investment from South African entrepreneur Christo Wiese\u2019s retail group Pepkor, now part of the Steinhoff group which owns stakes in New Look, Iceland, furnishings stores Bensons and Harveys.

Meanwhile, many high street retailers are under pressure from the rise in online shopping and a switch away from buying clothes and homewares towards holidays, eating out and technology. The demise of BHS, the low-end department store, last week has been partly blamed on its failure to keep up with shoppers\u2019 changing demands. Bond said: \u201cTimes are changing and sadly some brands become out of date. It is a very sad day for employees of the business.\u201d But he added: \u201cI don\u2019t think the high street\u2019s days are numbered at all. I do think it\u2019s a time of significant change of which online is a formidable force but there will forever be an opportunity to have a national chain of stores with the right sort of merchandise.\u201d Despite a slowdown in the pace of growth of discounter grocers Aldi and Lidl and some consolidation among general merchandise chains \u2013 with the merger of Poundland and 99p Stores \u2013 Bond says the growth of discount chains in the UK has not run its course. \u201cDiscounting continues to grow and there is an opportunity to grow it further,\u201d he says. If we opened a business that looked exactly like some others then I agree we would struggle but our target is mums with kids, offering something different including clothing and detailed ranges specifically targeted at them.\u201d Pep &amp; Co, which opened its first store in Kettering in July last year, is aiming to open 15 more stores this year as it takes on the likes of Primark with supermarket-style clothing on the high street. \u201cI\u2019m very pleased with progress. Starting up businesses is hard yards. But sometimes it\u2019s the right thing to do when you see a gap in the market and both Pep &amp; Co and GHM fill a gap,\u201d Bond says.",

      "bodyText": "The International Monetary Fund says Brexit would either be pretty bad or very bad. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development warns that there would be dire consequences not just for Britain, but for the rest of the world. The Bank of England says output would go down and inflation would go up. As far as George Osborne and David Cameron are concerned, the evidence could not be clearer. A vote to leave in the referendum would be a self-inflicted wound. They think they have won the economic argument, which is why the Brexiters are now focusing on immigration. The remain camp\u2019s strategy could yet pay off, but its case is not nearly as watertight as Cameron and co think. For a start, it is worth mentioning that the forecasting record of the IMF, the OECD and the Bank of England is rotten. Not one of these three august bodies was capable of predicting the 2008 crash \u2013 the biggest economic crisis in living memory \u2013 even when it was staring them in the face. In October 2008, a few weeks after the collapse of the US investment bank Lehman Brothers, the IMF published its half-yearly forecast for the world economy. It expected growth of 3%. Two years later, the Fund said the actual outcome had been a 0.6% decline. Similarly, when the Bank of England published its quarterly inflation report in August 2008, it said the economy would be broadly flat over the coming year. In reality, the UK had already been in recession for nearly six months and was part-way through a 6% peak-to-trough decline in national output. As for the OECD, it said in June 2008 that its rich-country members would enjoy growth of 1.7% the following year. Six months later, in the wake of the demise of Lehman, it predicted a fall of 0.4% and by the summer of 2009 the decline was put at 4.1%. The IMF, the Bank of England and the OECD are, in other words, like weather forecasters who cannot tell you whether you will need an umbrella tomorrow and are not entirely sure whether you will need one today, but can give you a convincing explanation of why it would have been a good idea to have had an umbrella with you yesterday. A few mavericks did spot the financial crisis coming, but their views were dismissed by a complacent economics establishment. The Queen famously put the dismal science in its place when she used a visit to the LSE in November 2008 to ask why nobody saw it coming. The fact that the great and good of the economics profession got it wrong over the financial crisis (and was, before that, wrong about the benefits of Britain joining the exchange rate mechanism and wrong about membership of the euro) does not, of course, necessarily mean it is wrong about Brexit. But it does suggest that the forecasts of impending doom should come with a health warning: groupthink is potentially dangerous and can damage your wealth. The reason the IMF, the OECD and the Treasury believe Brexit will cause long-term damage to the economy is that they all assume it will be more difficult for UK firms to access the single market. The resulting reduction in trade will harm productivity, and lower productivity will result in weaker growth. This analysis has been challenged by Ashoka Mody, who was deputy director of the IMF\u2019s research division before moving to Princeton University. He makes two points: that trade with other parts of the world will increase to compensate for less trade with the EU; and that there is no evidence that lower trade means lower productivity. \u201cMore trade has been associated with higher productivity growth when countries have emerged from economic isolation. But for the sophisticated British economy, this possibility should be completely dismissed\u201d, Mody said in an article for the Independent. But, as in the buildup to the Great Recession, such dissenting voices are pretty rare and tend to be drowned out by the warnings from the big institutions. Yet what\u2019s interesting is not that some voters are being swayed by the warnings of impending doom, but that so many others are not, leaving the Brexit side narrowly ahead in the latest Observer/Opinium poll. It\u2019s hard to provide a cast-iron explanation for this. Indeed, it may be that voters are not as impervious to the warnings as the polls currently suggest, and that the message is gradually percolating down. Alternatively, the remain camp could have badly miscalculated by relying so heavily on the IMF, the OECD, the Treasury, the Bank of England and the leading academic institutions. What if the blizzard of statistics and the trade theory is just going straight over the heads of voters? What if the public is not especially interested in whether GDP per household will be 6% lower in 2030 after Brexit than it would be if the UK stays in the EU, and finds the concept meaningless? The fact is that the public pays much less attention to even big economic events than politicians imagine. Take the budget, the single most important date in the economic calendar and which took place less than three months ago. Anybody reading this column probably has an interest in economics, so here\u2019s a question for you: can you name three of the measures that Osborne announced back in March? Tough, isn\u2019t it? Voters are influenced by the economy, but not by abstract statistics, such as mean or median GDP per head. They know when they last got a pay rise and how much it was. They know what it was like the last time they had to take a family member to an A&amp;E department. They know how much it costs to buy a house in their neighbourhood and whether it is possible for their children to get a foot on the property ladder. When Bobby Kennedy said that GDP measures everything except that which is worthwhile, he was absolutely right. The danger for Cameron and Osborne is that they come across \u2013 in the words of Nye Bevan\u2019s supposed dig at Hugh Gaitskell \u2013 as a pair of desiccated calculating machines, seemingly oblivious to the real concerns of the public. If they do emerge triumphant (as did Gaitskell over Bevan) it will be because of the Brexit side\u2019s determination to focus on two issues: sovereignty and immigration. It has decided that the best approach to remain\u2019s war of attrition is to fight on different fronts. This, though, ignores the obvious point: many voters are worried about immigration not because they are xenophobes but because, for them, it is an economic issue. They are less bothered about living standards, as narrowly defined by GDP per head, and more concerned about quality of life. This is particularly true of Labour voters living in less prosperous parts of Britain. They will decide the referendum\u2019s outcome.",

      "bodyText": "Behind the easy-going manner, Bank of England governor Mark Carney is angry. The object of his anger is Sir John Vickers, the mild-mannered former deputy governor who keeps telling the world that Carney has gone soft on the bankers. In recent months, when he hasn\u2019t been discussing the impact of the EU referendum, Carney has behaved as if he were a Plantagenet king, dispatching his lieutenants to crush a former friend turned critic. The most recent intervention was led by Martin Taylor, a Barclays chief in the 1990s who sits with Carney on the financial policy committee, the UK\u2019s financial watchdog. Taylor\u2019s defence of the FPC was cleverly couched not only as a rebuke to those who believe that it is weak, but also to those who consider regulation too tight, positioning the watchdog as even-handed \u2013 tough on banking, without crushing the industry under a welter of heavy-handed rules. Why must Vickers be intellectually assassinated? The answer is in the credit bubble that is growing by the week. The Bank is concerned that it will be undermined as chief regulator if critics can convince the public and parliament its policies have been watered down and rules that remain made so complex they can be gamed by the finance industry to a point where they are worthless in the event of a crash. Carney and the FPC are right to be worried. Vickers and others paint a scary picture of an industry where the culture has changed little and the next financial crisis is just around the corner. Not only did Vickers say bank lending should be capped at 25 times capital, only to be told the chancellor would tolerate 33 times, his plans for ringfencing (to keep a bank\u2019s retail operations separate from casino-style investment banking) were watered down. Vickers wanted the kind of simple ringfence an interested citizen might be able to understand. Instead, he got a complex web of capital ratios and inter-relationships that few but the geekiest bank experts can fathom. Bank chiefs are playing their old tunes. HSBC boss Stuart Gulliver said last year he would both cut the bank\u2019s riskiest assets and achieve double-digit returns. It showed he believes the pre-crash era of super-returns is close at hand now the regulator is subdued. Such is the huge volume of capital swimming around the global financial system that investors have for some time been spreading their bets, and this is where Carney\u2019s critics get really worried. Part of the reason Gulliver is under pressure to promise super-returns is that investors are diverting a large portion of their savings to sponsor a huge rise in shadow banking, which is the term for generally opaque lending by non-bank financial firms. There are bigger returns to be made than even bank bosses promise in their more exuberant statements. Already car loans in the US are looking like they are the new sub-prime lending scandal. Mortgage lending in the UK is heading the same way after reaching pre-crisis levels. Too often mortgages are sold to over-eager first-time buyers at astronomical income multiples. And that\u2019s the high-street banks at work. Carney, who is also chair of G20-sponsored global regulator the Financial Stability Board, says the bank is on the case. According to the FSB, a narrow definition of shadow banking shows it grew to $36 trillion, or 12% of financial system assets, in 2014. A wider aggregate figure for all shadow-banking activities, including pension funds and insurers who lend out their securities, hit $137tn, representing 40% of total financial system assets. Last month, Carney issued the FSB\u2019s latest review and urged countries to pay attention to the risks. But there is little public data on the scale of the risks taken by shadow banks and very little regulation. A report by the University of Leeds and the University of the Basque Country shows that business school economists from across Europe are worried. They believe the culture of banks has changed little since the crash and governments are still in thrall to their financial sectors as cash generators, ignoring the risks they pose to their economies and social structures. More than 90% of the 50 experts polled for the EU-funded Financialisation, Economy, Society and Sustainable Development (FESSUD) research project said that the benefits of finance were either overestimated or highly overestimated. They said the excessive size of the finance sector and poor regulation were the causes of the last crash. More than 70% said the flawed economic theory that underpinned a belief in financial systems as self-correcting was another factor. These economists are not from the Corbyn/Sanders wing of academia. Some advise finance firms and even sit on bank advisory boards. Nevertheless, they believe the financial services sector will continue to grow, providing investors with risky profits, while the benefits for Europe\u2019s citizens are \u201climited and likely negative\u201d. Worse for Carney, the economists are especially concerned about shadow banking, saying that as banks are further regulated, shadow banking will grow with, at best, loose regulation. Their views tell Carney he should lay off Vickers and intervene across the entire industry to limit damage from a financial crash. If shadow finance has the ability to add a further twist to the turmoil, it will be in setting off defaults and bankruptcies across businesses and households, while having only a fraction of the weakened checks and balances on the banks. It goes to show regulators need more bite and less bark.",

      "bodyText": "Britain is trapped in its own little Brexit bubble. For the next two and a half weeks, the country will be obsessed with the result of the referendum on 23 June. Nothing that is going on in the rest of the world will get much of a look-in. But beyond these shores, things are happening. The authorities in China are desperately trying to shore up growth. Eurozone finance ministers have all but guaranteed that, sooner or later, the Greek crisis will flare up again. Most pressingly, the US economy looks to be heading for serious trouble. Make no mistake, the jobs report issued in Washington on Friday was a shocker. Wall Street had been expecting the non-farm payroll \u2013 the benchmark for the strength of the US labour market \u2013 to increase by 164,000. The actual figure was 38,000, the smallest monthly increase since September 2010. True, the total was slightly distorted because 35,000 striking workers at Verizon were counted as jobless because they were not being paid. But that still would have meant an NFP increase of just 73,000. The weak jobs report comes at a particularly sensitive time because America\u2019s central bank, the Federal Reserve, has been softening the markets up for an increase in interest rates, either this month or next. Any such move is now out of the question. US borrowing costs will not be going up again until the autumn at the earliest. This is all rather chastening for the Fed. When it raised interest rates in December for the first time since the Great Recession, the central bank signalled that there would be four more increases during the course of 2016. Financial markets subsequently went into freefall during the early weeks of the year, forcing the Fed into a crash rethink. In March, it indicated that the number of 2016 rate increases had been halved from four to two \u2013 but the guidance was promptly ignored by traders, who based their decisions on the assumption that there would be no further tightening of policy by the Fed until 2017. With its reputation at stake, the Fed has gone out of its way since March to convince the markets that it was serious about two rate rises in 2016. Really, really it was. Janet Yellen, the Fed\u2019s chair, told Wall Street that it might be \u201cconfused\u201d about the way the central bank was going about its business. Yet if anyone is confused it is Yellen, not the markets, which have rightly calculated that the Fed is all talk and should be judged by what it does and not by what it says. Here\u2019s the position. The US economy grew at an annualised rate of 0.8% in the first quarter of 2016, which was not just weaker than the UK but substantially worse than the eurozone. Friday\u2019s May payrolls were not a one-off, since the totals for March and April were revised downwards by a combined 59,000. Even what looked like good news \u2013 a drop in the unemployment rate \u2013 was caused by discouraged workers giving up hope of finding a job. Growth will pick up a bit in the second quarter on the back of stronger consumer spending, but not by all that much. In the circumstances, it beggars belief that the Fed will raise rates in the next couple of months. If Yellen continues to talk tough, the markets will throw a tantrum, and that will be enough to tip an already feeble economy over the edge into recession. Share prices will plummet, the oil price will head back towards $30 a barrel. It will be like early 2016, only worse. So all the Fed can do is respond to the data by toning down the rhetoric. That will be embarrassing. It will mean eating humble pie. It will further damage the bank\u2019s credibility. But it has no choice. The writing\u2019s on the wall for Opec \u2013 and Riyadh knows it No one got in much of a lather about the failure of Opec to agree anything meaningful at the ministerial meeting in Vienna last week. In fact, the only announcement the oil cartel had to make was that they had picked a new (Nigerian) secretary general. Why the calm? One, because the oil price is drifting upwards again anyway; two, because everyone has become used to Opec agreeing nothing; and three, because the world of black gold is increasingly losing its glitter. No one has yet found a way to fly commercial planes without aviation fuel from hydrocarbons, road transport still relies on petrol, and power stations still produce electricity from gas. But the writing is on the wall for those at Opec\u2019s gatherings and the oil industry around them. Global governmental action to counter climate change, plus the fast development of electric vehicles and storage systems, will crush the oil industry. The question is not if but when, and the decline is likely to be faster than many imagine. Oil-rich Saudi Arabia knows this. It has announced plans to dilute its holdings in the state oil company, move its economy away from petroleum dependency and put its cash in other activities, including low-carbon ones. The Saudis are investing in solar, in carbon capture and in tech companies. Last week, the Saudi sovereign wealth fund put $3.5bn into ride-sharing business Uber. The oil companies, led by Total, have been buying stakes in \u201cgreen\u201d businesses, such as windfarms, and battery and storage firms like Saft. Meanwhile, traditional car manufacturers are making similar moves. Toyota has also invested in Uber, while Volkswagen has purchased a stake in a similar business, Gett. General Motors and BMW have also bought into ride-sharing services \u2013 Lyft and Scoop, respectively. Tech entrepreneur Elon Musk reckons his new line of electric storage systems will sell as fast as his Tesla electric vehicles (EVs). The message for the future is: \u201cDon\u2019t think Opec, think EV.\u201d The UK is content to avoid doing much about tax On Friday, police searched the Spanish HQ of Santander for evidence of its customers hiding their money in HSBC\u2019s Swiss private bank. A few days before that, French magistrates raided Google\u2019s head office in Paris over suspicions of tax evasion. European parliament members will rubber-stamp the mandate of an inquiry into the Panama Papers this week. They fully intend to call George Osborne and HM Revenue and Customs bosses as witnesses, to explain why London now rivals Zurich as a money-laundering hub. Further afield, in Brazil, El Salvador, Peru and even Panama, there have been raids on the offices of Mossack Fonseca, the law firm at the heart of the Panama Papers revelations. Nevada fined the firm\u2019s local representative, which is now closing down. Even in Switzerland, April\u2019s disclosures prompted a search of Uefa\u2019s HQ as well as the retrieval of an allegedly Nazi-looted Modigliani painting from the vaults of the Geneva Freeport warehouse. Meanwhile, at the Hitchin offices of Mossack Fonseca\u2019s UK representative, where the paperwork of thousands of offshore companies was processed, life goes on as normal. Successive scandals have made one thing clear: Britain seems happy to leave the policing of tax matters to its European neighbours.",
