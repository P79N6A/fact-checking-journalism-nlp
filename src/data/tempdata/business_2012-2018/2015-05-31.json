    "webTitle": "Tsipras lambasts 'absurd proposals' of creditors for Greece debt-deal failure", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Greece\u2019s beleaguered prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, has blamed the \u201cabsurd proposals\u201d of creditors keeping the debt-stricken country afloat for the failure to reach a deal that could release emergency aid to avert default. In a hard-hitting article for the French daily Le Monde, the leader lambasted the uncompromising approach of the EU, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund for five months of fruitless negotiations. \u201cThe lack of an agreement so far is not due to the supposed intransigent, uncompromising and incomprehensible Greek stance,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt is due to the insistence of certain institutional actors on submitting absurd proposals and displaying a total indifference to the recent democratic choice of the Greek people.\u201d The Greek leader held a telephone call on Sunday night with the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and France\u2019s Fran\u00e7ois Hollande to discuss the situation. All three leaders reiterated the need for a quick agreement, according to one official in Athens. Tsipras\u2019s intervention via La Monde \u2013 on the day when his anti-austerity coalition had hoped to wrap up talks \u2013 came amid clear signs of strain in the Syriza-led government as senior members of the radical left party denounced the appointment of the Greek-American economist Elena Panaritis as Greece\u2019s representative at the IMF. By Sunday night some 43 Syriza cadres, including deputy prime minister Yannis Dragasakis, had signed a petition opposing finance minister Yanis Varoufakis\u2019s choice of Panaritis. She had formerly represented the pro-bailout Pasok party as an honorary MP. The row prompted Varoufakis to go on to Twitter on Sunday morning to deny that his position in Tsipras\u2019s government could be at risk. \u201cRumours of my impending resignation are (for the umpteenth time) grossly premature...\u201d, he tweeted to his 425,000 followers. Varoufakis then told one follower that, as John Maynard Keynes put it, \u201cin the long run we are all dead\u201d, but \u201cin the medium run, those nostalgic of the troika days are stuck with me\u201d. The furore came as senior eurozone officials insisted that both sides were still far apart in agreeing on the fundamentals of a cash-for-reform deal. Repeated expressions of optimism by the Greek government not only ran contrary to reality, but were aimed squarely at stopping a run on the banks, they believe. \u201cIt is a lie that there is any optimism. There is no optimism.

      "bodyText": "With 100,000 cases of skin cancer resulting from overexposure to ultraviolet light in Britain every year, the dangers of too much sun are well known. Dr David Hazafy, a scientist at Queen\u2019s University Belfast, believes there is another problem: those afraid of getting skin cancer do not venture outside and deprive themselves of the vitamin D their body needs. His solution is a simple and cheap piece of plastic which can be tied around the wrist and contains an ink which disappears when the user has been exposed to the recommended daily dose of sun for their skin tone. \u201cIt is for people who care about the potential dangers but still want to have some fun \u2013 mothers, parents for their children or for themselves, older people, people who want to know when it is still safe,\u201d Hazafy says. The wristband can also be used with sunscreens to mimic the reaction of the skin to sunlight, allowing parents to see how long their children should stay outside during the day, says Hazafy, who works at the school of chemistry and chemical engineering at Queen\u2019s. \u201cThe sunshine gets the negative press. People are quite scared of getting skin cancer so they don\u2019t go out at all. They cover themselves and then there is a problem with vitamin D deficiencies. You need a little bit of sunshine to create vitamin D. If you don\u2019t go out at all because you think the sun is dangerous, you don\u2019t get it\u201d he says. While sunshine is mostly made up of UV A rays, UV B rays are responsible for 80% of skin cancer cases, and this is what the technology focuses on. The ink on the plastic wristband is made up of dye and a photocatalyst, a substance which harvests energy from sunlight to cause chemical reactions. When the photocatalyst absorbs UV light, the energy drives a change in the dye: so as the sunlight is absorbed, the colour slowly disappears. When it disappears completely, the maximum amount of UV B light for the day has been absorbed and the wearer knows that they should withdraw from the sun. If sunscreen is added to the plastic, it will again mimic how sunscreen acts when it is added to the skin, prolonging the amount of time that the user can be exposed. As different skin types can take varying amounts of sun, the ink can be altered so that it changes at different rates,says Hazafy. When the product comes to market, there will likely be three different formulations for varying skin types which will allow most people use the bands, he says. Dermatologists \u201ccalculate the times, how much UV light you can take without getting sunburnt and that is what the colour change tells you\u201d, he says. Behind the company set up to commercialise the product, SunCatalyst Laboratories, is Hazafy and Prof Andrew Mills, also from the school of chemistry and chemical engineering at Queen\u2019s University. What the final product will look like has not yet been decided. As the dye is not destroyed when it is exposed to sunlight, it can \u2018recharge\u2019 or return to its original form overnight. This could result in the technology either being on a permanent band, such as those used by charities, or on a piece of biodegradable plastic which could then be thrown away, says Hazafy. It can be waterproofed by sandwiching the plastic with another plastic, he says. The product itself is \u201cvery inexpensive\u201d to make and could retail for between \u00a35 and \u00a310 for a package of disposal bands which would last for a two week holiday or be sold with sunscreen, he says. It will also be possible to print with the ink so that messages can come up on the wristband when the maximum exposure is met, says Hazafy, who aims to have it on the shelves for summer 2016. The NHS says that there are over 100,000 new cases of non-melanoma skin cancer \u2013 cancers in the upper layer of the skin which are caused by overexposure to UV light \u2013 in the UK every year. Treating cancer with a virus Researchers in cancer therapies have found that patients with aggressive skin cancer have been treated successfully with a drug based on the herpes virus. The treatment mark a success for virotherapy, where one disease is used to attack another. Trial results have shown that the therapy, which is not yet licensed, could prolong survival for a number of years in some patients.

      "body": "<p>For members of the Irish parliament who represent constituencies where Aer Lingus flies the shamrock tailfin around Europe and the world, last week was a nervous affair. The parent of British Airways was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/may/26/iag-given-clearance-by-irish-government-for-aer-lingus-takeover\">sealing its takeover of the former state carrier</a> and it was an especially tense affair for politicians from the two governing parties: Fine Gael and Labour.<br></p> <p>As the Irish government, the board of Aer Lingus and Willie Walsh, the Irishman who heads up BA owner International Airlines Group, finalised their negotiations about the takeover of Ireland\u2019s premier airline, representatives from around Dublin, Cork and Shannon watched on with trepidation.</p> <p>Any hint that the sale of the state\u2019s 25% stake in Aer Lingus to IAG would result in job losses or cuts to air routes from the three airports might have produced rebellions on the backbenches inside Leinster House.</p> <p>In the end the vote to sell the government\u2019s share in Aer Lingus to IAG was carried by 74 votes to 51 on Thursday inside the D\u00e1il. Only one Labour deputy, Michael McNamara, broke ranks to join the opposition and vote against the deal. Assurances from Ireland\u2019s transport minister Paschal Donohue and Walsh \u2013 once an Aer Lingus employee and chief executive - that for seven years jobs and air routes from the three airports would not be under threat appeared to have worked.</p> <p>It remains to be seen if those assurances and promises of new transatlantic routes opening up from Dublin airport, and with them the prospect of more jobs, will be enough to counter any public anger over the sale of a national asset. In addition the sale will generate more than \u20ac330m for the government, which says it will use the proceeds to roll out a new broadband network. With an election due in 2016 this is extra cash in the government\u2019s war chest it can spend after years of cuts and austerity to please the International Monetary Fund and European Central Bank.</p> <p>Certainly in terms of cold economic logic the sell-off of the state\u2019s Aer Lingus share makes sense.

      "bodyText": "For members of the Irish parliament who represent constituencies where Aer Lingus flies the shamrock tailfin around Europe and the world, last week was a nervous affair. The parent of British Airways was sealing its takeover of the former state carrier and it was an especially tense affair for politicians from the two governing parties: Fine Gael and Labour. As the Irish government, the board of Aer Lingus and Willie Walsh, the Irishman who heads up BA owner International Airlines Group, finalised their negotiations about the takeover of Ireland\u2019s premier airline, representatives from around Dublin, Cork and Shannon watched on with trepidation. Any hint that the sale of the state\u2019s 25% stake in Aer Lingus to IAG would result in job losses or cuts to air routes from the three airports might have produced rebellions on the backbenches inside Leinster House. In the end the vote to sell the government\u2019s share in Aer Lingus to IAG was carried by 74 votes to 51 on Thursday inside the D\u00e1il. Only one Labour deputy, Michael McNamara, broke ranks to join the opposition and vote against the deal. Assurances from Ireland\u2019s transport minister Paschal Donohue and Walsh \u2013 once an Aer Lingus employee and chief executive - that for seven years jobs and air routes from the three airports would not be under threat appeared to have worked. It remains to be seen if those assurances and promises of new transatlantic routes opening up from Dublin airport, and with them the prospect of more jobs, will be enough to counter any public anger over the sale of a national asset. In addition the sale will generate more than \u20ac330m for the government, which says it will use the proceeds to roll out a new broadband network. With an election due in 2016 this is extra cash in the government\u2019s war chest it can spend after years of cuts and austerity to please the International Monetary Fund and European Central Bank. Certainly in terms of cold economic logic the sell-off of the state\u2019s Aer Lingus share makes sense. With only just over a quarter of the stake in the business, the Irish government was a minority player on the Aer Lingus board. Ryanair, under the stewardship of the mischievous Michael O\u2019Leary, has almost 30% of the shares in the carrier and therefore exercised more influence than Cabinet members in Dublin. The state\u2019s grip on the airline loosened considerably when Aer Lingus was floated on the stock exchange almost a decade ago.

      "bodyText": "For 75 months it has been the same story. The nine members of the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee gather, consider all the latest evidence and decide that official interest rates should remain at 0.5%. Interest rates are at rock-bottom levels pretty much everywhere in the developed world and the moment for raising them continues to be pushed back. But central banks have not just relied on interest rates. They have also been active in the financial markets, exchanging bonds and other assets for cash. This process, known as quantitative easing, has increased the supply of money and driven down long-term interest rates. For a while, finance ministries also did their part. During the worst of the crisis in 2008-09, they cut taxes and increased spending in order to boost economic activity. In Britain, the result of running much bigger annual budget deficits led to a doubling of the national debt as a share of economic output from 40% to 80%. The stimulus worked, but only up to a point. The US, for example, has a history of bouncing back from recessions but growth has averaged only 2% a year in the six years since the economy bottomed out. Put another way, America\u2019s most severe post-war recession has been followed by the weakest recovery. The eurozone is on course to post growth of around 1.5% this year - and that\u2019s considered good. By recent standards, it is. After all this time and all that effort, central banks would also not have expected inflation to be so low. Yet in the UK, the cost of living as measured by the consumer prices index has gone negative for the first time in half a century. Earnings are increasing at half their pre-crisis rate. So, seen from the perspective of both growth and inflation, there is good reason for central banks to be wary of tightening policy. There are, though, other reasons why central banks might want to raise interest rates or to start unwinding QE. One is that too much stimulus for too long, particularly if it is of the unconventional sort, can have unintended consequences. Interest rates at close to zero plus oodles of cheap credit have encouraged a search for yield, the hunt for investments that provide a decent return. This, inevitably, means riskier bets, as it did in the years leading up to the financial crisis. One key lesson of that period is that crises can erupt even when inflation is low. The second reason central banks would have liked by now to have returned policy to a more normal setting is that they have little wriggle room if things turn nasty again. Official forecasts always assume that economies will enjoy reasonable levels of growth with modest levels of inflation. But, regular as clockwork, stuff happens. Recessions occur, often suddenly, and for all sorts of reasons. In those circumstances, central bankers and finance ministers need firepower. Ideally, they want to be in a position to slash interest rates, run bigger budget deficits and, if necessary, resort to the more unconventional instruments such as QE. This firepower is currently lacking. On average, the US Federal Reserve has cut its main interest rate by five percentage points in each of the recessions since the 1970s. That\u2019s impossible with interest rates so close to zero. Increasing QE runs the risk of further inflating share prices, which are already high. Governments can always spend and borrow more in times of trouble, but ideally would like to have built up a war chest first. In most countries, this has proved impossible. Given time, central banks and finance ministries will replenish their ammunition. Interest rates will gradually be raised. Growth will lead to higher tax returns and lower spending on welfare. It would be greatly beneficial were the global economy to be set fair for a repeat of what Lord Mervyn King described as the Nice decade (non-inflationary, continual expansion). But this can\u2019t be guaranteed. Imagine that Greece defaults on its debts and returns to the drachma, with knock-on effects on the eurozone and the wider global economy. Or that the recent plunge in shares on the Shanghai stock exchange are the portent of a hard landing in China. Or that the recent rise in bond yields (the interest rate paid) is a sign of a bubble about to burst. Stephen King, chief economist at HSBC, calls this the world\u2019s \u201cTitanic problem\u201d, by which he means there are plenty of icebergs but no lifeboats. So what are the options for policy makers? King lists six. Firstly, they could try to avoid hitting one of the icebergs. They tighten supervision and regulation of the financial sector, force banks to hold more capital, keep a wary eye on asset prices. But the next crisis might not originate from the banks. It might stem from the insurance industry, struggling to cope with ultra-low interest rates or from over-leveraged hedge funds. Secondly, they could do more QE. Given the limited success of QE so far, coupled with the risk of dangerous side-effects, this looks unlikely to be all that effective. Thirdly, they could decide to ignore the fact that inflation is well below the targets set for central banks and decide that the threat of asset-price bubbles warrants higher interest rates. This might trigger the recession policy makers are seeking to avoid. Fourthly, they could decide to turn to fiscal policy \u2013 tax cuts and higher public spending \u2013 on the grounds that there was little scope to boost the economy through interest rates and QE. But as King notes, this is only possible if governments are \u201cwilling and able to tolerate deficits and debt levels far higher than seen in the peacetime past\u201d. Fifthly, they could resort to \u201chelicopter drops\u201d of money, which is where a central bank creates money and the finance ministry hands it out in the form of tax cuts or higher public spending. There are two downsides with this option. One is that in some countries, including the UK, the increased spending would result in higher imports and a balance of payments crisis. The second is the risk of hyper-inflation. King says his sixth and final option would be to raise retirement ages. There is a global glut of savings, he says, caused by people salting money away for their old age. Working longer would mean people spending more, raising growth rates. This would boost tax revenues and allow interest rates to rise. Governments would once again have some ammo, but at the expense of political unpopularity. King says that if history is any guide, we are probably closer to the next US recession than the last one. Back in 2008-09, there were lifeboats even if there weren\u2019t enough of them. Next time, if there is a next time, the losses would be worse.",

      "bodyText": "A year ago Sir Ken Morrison, the founder of Morrisons supermarket, tore into the grocer\u2019s then chief executive, Dalton Philips, in a scathing intervention at the annual general meeting. After listening to Philips outlining his latest strategy to modernise the Bradford-based chain, Morrison said: \u201cWhen I left work and started working as a hobby, I chose to raise cattle. I have something like 1,000 bullocks and, having listened to your presentation, Dalton, you\u2019ve got a lot more bullshit than me.\u201d Still, now that Philips has been replaced by David Potts \u2013 on top of the boardroom cull instigated by new chairman Andy Higginson last March \u2013 can we expect the Morrison clan to stay quiet at this week\u2019s annual gathering of shareholders? Er, probably not. Sir Ken will be in attendance, with other family members, who are expected to register their displeasure at the \u00a32.1m Philips trousered last year, plus a \u00a31.1m payoff. They have a point, but it will need to be made with care, as the ferocity of last year\u2019s attack left some in the City feeling for Philips. He perhaps wasn\u2019t the best boss in the grocer\u2019s history (there have been six), but they argue he only actually made two mistakes: the first was taking the long and expensive route to reversing the errors of Sir Ken; and the second was making blunders of his own. EasyHotel: is it in the black? There is a quite a well-known story, dating back a couple of millennia, that touches on the difficulty of checking into a hotel on Christmas Eve. Less well known, possibly because it occurred after the New Testament went to press, is the one about the hotel finance director checking out on 24 December, which was the misfortune that befell the so-called \u201csuper-budget\u201d hotel group easyHotel last year. It was on that day that another of those companies created by Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou announced that Darren Mee, the finance director who\u2019d helped float the company just six months earlier, would be tiptoeing out the door. After Stelios, Mee was the company\u2019s largest private shareholder, so his early departure caused shareholders as many sleepless nights as those suffered by the firm\u2019s punters, surrounded by that orange decor. The shares have lost about 17% since then, but the company has found a new finance chief and is adding sites. So the group\u2019s interim results this week will provide the City a much-sought-after view \u2013 which is more than can be said for the guests. Its rooms without a window always sell first, apparently. Banana skins for G4S G4S, the accident-prone security group and frequent star of this page, has been at it again. Last week, one of its guards was accused of smuggling refugees through airport security checks, with Austrian prosecutors alleging that the employee was one of 13 private security staff in Vienna suspected of using their security access to slip a few surprise passengers on board flights to the US and UK. It is yet another cracking yarn to add to the G4S scrapbook of hilarious gaffes, which seem to have been lifted straight from a Tom Sharpe novel. They have included: a prisoner tricking his G4S guards into tagging his prosthetic leg, thereby allowing him to skip his curfew by detaching the limb; a security guard on a routine cash-collection call at Poundland taking his break immediately after parking his van outside the store - thereby allowing an impostor to dress in a G4S uniform and collect \u00a314,000 of takings; and another of the firm\u2019s guards absentmindedly leaving his loaded shotgun at a cash machine. All of those gems occurred just before the company was about to address the City (and argue that the group really isn\u2019t too large to manage) so is there anything in the diary this week? Indeed there is. G4S will host its annual meeting on Thursday.",

He perhaps wasn\u2019t the best boss in the grocer\u2019s history (there have been six), but they argue he only actually made two mistakes: the first was taking the long and expensive route to reversing the errors of Sir Ken; and the second was making blunders of his own.</p> <h2>EasyHotel: is it in the black?</h2> <p>There is a quite a well-known story, dating back a couple of millennia, that touches on the difficulty of checking into a hotel on Christmas Eve.</p> <p>Less well known, possibly because it occurred after the New Testament went to press, is the one about the hotel finance director checking out on 24&#xa0;December, which was the misfortune that befell the so-called \u201csuper-budget\u201d hotel group easyHotel last year.</p> <p>It was on that day that another of those companies created by Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou announced that Darren Mee, the finance director who\u2019d helped float the company just six months earlier, would be tiptoeing out the door. After Stelios, Mee was the company\u2019s largest private shareholder, so his early departure caused shareholders as many sleepless nights as those suffered by the firm\u2019s punters, surrounded by that orange decor.</p> <p>The shares have lost about 17% since then, but the company has found a new finance chief and is adding sites. So the group\u2019s interim results this week will provide the City a much-sought-after view \u2013 which is more than can be said for the guests. Its rooms without a window always sell first, apparently.</p> <h2>Banana skins for G4S</h2> <p>G4S, the accident-prone security group and frequent star of this page, has been at it again. Last week, one of its guards was accused of smuggling refugees through airport security checks, with Austrian prosecutors alleging that the employee was one of 13 private security staff in Vienna suspected of using their security access to slip a few surprise passengers on board flights to the US and UK.</p> <p>It is yet another cracking yarn to add to the G4S scrapbook of hilarious gaffes, which seem to have been lifted straight from a Tom Sharpe novel. They have included: a prisoner tricking his G4S guards into tagging his prosthetic leg, thereby allowing him to skip his curfew by detaching the limb; a security guard on a routine cash-collection call at Poundland taking his break immediately after parking his van outside the store - thereby allowing an impostor to dress in a G4S uniform and collect \u00a314,000 of takings; and another of the firm\u2019s guards absentmindedly leaving his loaded shotgun at a cash machine.</p> <p>All of those gems occurred just before the company was about to address the City (and argue that the group really isn\u2019t too large to manage) so is there anything in the diary this week? Indeed there is. G4S will host its annual meeting on Thursday.</p>",
