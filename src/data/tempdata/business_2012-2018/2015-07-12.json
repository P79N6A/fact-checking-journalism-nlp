      "bodyText": "George Osborne\u2019s pledge to fix Britain\u2019s woeful productivity record will be called into question by a leading business group on Monday when it highlights a skills crisis and redoubles criticism of the government\u2019s apprenticeship plans. As official figures this week are expected to show wages picking up and unemployment holding at a seven-year low, the CBI highlights that a growing number of employers are struggling to fill skilled jobs. The chancellor used his post-election budget last week to unveil new measures to boost apprenticeship numbers and to bring in a higher minimum wage dubbed the \u201cnational living wage\u201d. Faced with a productivity puzzle that has seen the UK\u2019s output per hour fail to match economic growth, he also announced a productivity plan to put the recovery on a firmer footing. But the CBI says skills shortages have already started to bite and warns that sectors seen as key by ministers are particularly hard-pressed, according to its annual skills survey. \u201cThe government has set out its stall to create a high-skilled economy, but firms are facing a skills emergency now, threatening to starve economic growth,\u201d said the CBI deputy director general, Katja Hall. \u201cWorryingly, it\u2019s those high-growth, high-value sectors with the most potential which are the ones under most pressure. That includes construction, manufacturing, science, engineering and technology.\u201d Two in three businesses expect to need more staff with higher level skills in the years ahead, but more than half of those surveyed, or 55%, fear that they will not be able to find them, according to the CBI\u2019s poll, which was carried out with the publisher Pearson. Rising skills demand in key sectors The survey of 310 companies, between them employing more than a million people, suggests demand for highly skilled workers is particularly acute in sectors that economists underscore as critical to rebalancing the UK economy away from its over-reliance on debt-driven consumer demand. A net balance of 73% of construction companies and 69% of manufacturers said their demand for high-skilled staff was rising. Business groups have repeatedly warned that tackling the UK\u2019s skills shortage is key to kickstarting productivity growth in the UK after years of lagging behind most other big economies. The CBI believes more apprenticeships will help but it criticises a plan in Osborne\u2019s budget for a levy on large firms to pay for training and create 3m apprenticeships by 2020. \u201cThe new levy announced in the budget may guarantee funding for more apprenticeships, but it\u2019s unlikely to equate to higher quality or deliver the skills that industry needs,\u201d said Hall. Renewed evidence of skills shortages will provide more food for thought for Bank of England policymakers as they assess the pressure on inflation from wages. The nine members of the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee appear divided over the likely path of pay growth and the implications for when they should raise interest rates from the current record low of 0.5%. The Bank\u2019s chief economist, Andy Haldane, has said he needs more evidence of pay growth picking up before worrying about inflation. He warned last month that raising interest rates too soon could tip the UK back into recession. But his fellow policymaker Martin Weale believes the labour market is \u201cfizzing away nicely\u201d and wages have picked up faster than expected. Weale, who voted for rate rises last year, suggested in an interview with the Financial Times that the Bank should be ready to raise rates as soon as August. For now, economists expect inflation to remain well below the Bank\u2019s target and so there will be little pressure to end the period of ultra-low borrowing costs ushered in by the financial crisis more than six years ago. Markets are not pricing in a rate rise until well into 2016. Zero inflation Official figures on Tuesday are expected to show inflation on the consumer price index (CPI) measure dipping back to zero in June, from 0.1% in May. Some economists in a Reuters poll forecast prices could even be down on a year earlier. That would mark a return to the negative inflation seen in April, which was the first instance in more than half a century. While inflation is well off the government-set target for 2% and has been characterised by some government critics as a sign of economic fragility, for households, it means they are better off in real terms. Wages rising in real terms Official figures on Wednesday are expected to show wages rising 3.3% during the three months to May after growth of 2.7% in the three months to April. That would be the fastest pace for five years and bring relief after years of average pay falling in real terms because it lagged inflation. \u201cWith CPI inflation still hugging zero, real wage inflation of 3% year-on-year is very robust and great news for consumer spending growth,\u201d said Alan Clarke, strategist at Scotiabank.",

      "bodyText": "The economic benefits for a country from tackling climate change easily outweigh the costs, according to a study that seeks to highlight the incentives for individual nations to take urgent action to cut emissions. Countries stand to gain more than they would lose in economic terms from almost all of the actions needed to meet an agreed global warming limit of no more than 2C above pre-industrial levels, according to the paper published by two research institutes at the London School of Economics. It is the latest research to underscore the apparent economic gains from limiting emissions, which include new jobs and improved health, even before the benefits of preventing dangerous climate change are taken into account. \u201cThe majority of the global emissions reductions needed to decarbonise the global economy can be achieved in ways that are nationally net-beneficial to countries, even leaving aside the \u2018climate benefits\u2019,\u201d says Fergus Green in his paper for the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment and ESRC Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy at the LSE. He cites improved air quality, increased energy efficiency and better energy security among the potential benefits to individual countries that more than justify the costs of cutting carbon emissions. Furthermore, investments in low-carbon energy are likely to be more than paid back by the falling cost of renewable sources, such as solar and wind, and by reduced spending on fossil fuels, Green predicts. \u201cAll things considered, I conclude that there is a very strong case that most of the mitigation action needed to stay within the internationally agreed 2\u00b0C limit is likely to be nationally net-beneficial,\u201d adds Green, who is also research adviser to the economist Lord Stern, author of an influential study on climate change. The world\u2019s nations have agreed that 2C is the maximum safe limit for a rise in global temperatures. Currently, the world is heading for a catastrophic 5C of warming and the deadline to seal a global climate deal comes in December at a crunch UN summit in Paris. It will be the first significant attempt to reach a worldwide consensus on global warming targets since the infamously chaotic UN summit in Copenhagen in 2009. In the runup to the meeting, the new paper warns countries against assuming they can, or should, look for a \u201cfree ride\u201d on the efforts of other nations to tackle climate change. Green says that countries would gain by working together to bring down the costs of a transition to a low-carbon economy and sharing the benefits that such investment would deliver. \u201cThe findings of this research suggest that the traditional assumption that action on climate change is net-costly is false. Those who think there is an incentive for countries to \u2018free-ride\u2019 on the climate protection provided by others are very much mistaken,\u201d says Green. \u201cCountries should see the climate talks in Paris this December as an opportunity to work with each other to deliver as quickly as possible the mutual gains that can result from decarbonising the economy.\u201d The report\u2019s conclusions echo those of the Nobel prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz, who used an address to a major science conference in the French capital last week to back the affordability for countries of tackling climate change. \u201cCreating a green economy is not only consistent with economic growth, it can promote economic growth,\u201d he said, especially when there was a lack of demand in the global economy.",

But Germany\u2019s proposal for Greece to leave the euro has portended a deep split between two key creditors of the indebted country. France brusquely dismissed the German ultimatum, revealing the potential for a serious rift between Paris and Berlin should moves to kick Greece out of the single currency succeed. Responding on Sunday to proposals from the German finance ministry that Greece could be expelled from the currency union for five years if it is impossible to agree on a new bailout, the French president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, declared there could be no temporary Grexit. His finance minister, Michel Sapin, mocked the German suggestion as \u201cgallery entertainment\u201d. \u201cThere is no provisional Grexit. There\u2019s Grexit or no Grexit,\u201d said Hollande. \u201cOr to put it simply in French, there is Greece in the eurozone or Greece outside the eurozone and that would be a Europe that is regressing, not advancing. I don\u2019t want that.\u201d Nonetheless, a Greek \u201ctime out\u201d from the eurozone was still on the negotiating table on Sunday night. The divisions among Greece\u2019s eurozone creditors were evident elsewhere on a weekend of intense negotiations. For one creditor country, the conflict was internecine. This was evidenced by the behaviour of one eurozone finance minister on the \u201cdoorstep\u201d \u2013 a curious Brussels media ritual where journalists camp outside the conference rooms to catch the politicians\u2019 often banal remarks as they enter. Alexander Stubb, the finance minister of Finland, is a doorstep devotee. Telegenic, media savvy, always the first and the last to tweet, Stubb is not known to shun the cameras, microphones and notebooks. But on Saturday afternoon Stubb stayed stumm. He swept into the critical session of eurozone finance ministers from his car without a word. The reason was that in Helsinki, a \u201cgrand committee\u201d of 25 MPs of the Finnish parliament was simultaneously taking a decision that would tie Stubb\u2019s hands. Timo Soini, the Finnish coalition\u2019s foreign minister and nationalist leader, threatened to bring down the government if Finland doled out any more money to Greece. The Brussels meeting was to decide whether to negotiate a new third bailout worth up to \u20ac86bn (\u00a362bn). Without it, according to the assessment of the European Central Bank and the European commission, Greece\u2019s bankruptcy was very certain, the entire Greek banking sector would collapse, and \u201cGreek citizens would suffer significant income losses\u201d. The sole purpose of the emergency meeting on Saturday, which lasted nine hours and broke up without agreement, was to decide whether to try to reach a deal with Athens on the new rescue package. But Stubb had no mandate to say yes to that. It was not even clear why he was present when the decision had already been taken in Helsinki. That was one bombshell that exploded in mid-evening. The other sensation was Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, the German finance minister. Long the eurozone\u2019s leading fiscal hawk, he has regularly used the doorstep as a stage for his caustic and withering remarks on Greece. This time there was an even sharper, more hopeless edge to his predictions. The government of Alexis Tsipras in Athens, he said, had spent its six months in office \u201cdestroying hope in an incredible way\u201d. His officials then leaked a one-page German finance ministry paper which was seen by the French and the Italians as a brutal attempt to impose total surrender on Greece, almost gleefully. Sch\u00e4uble is often mischievous. This time he was not joking. The document dismissed the Greek reforms and cuts proposals, lauded by many, as woefully inadequate. It said the commission should be put in charge of supervising any new bailout in Greece and demanded that \u20ac50bn of prime Greek property assets be lodged in a trust fund outside the country, which would first serve as collateral for new loans and then be sold off for debt servicing. \u201cThe existing risk of not concluding a new [bailout] programme should rest with Greece, not with eurozone countries,\u201d said the paper. If such draconian measures prove unacceptable to Athens, then Greece could stay in the EU but with its euro membership suspended for at least five years. Sch\u00e4uble, who went into the meeting declaring that there could not be a haircut on Greek debt because it was illegal under EU treaties, conceded in the paper for the first time that a writeoff of Greek debt was possible after all \u2013 but only if Greece was no longer in the euro. The German paper was neither formally presented nor discussed during the nine hours of fraught negotiations. But it hovered over the meeting like a large primed weapon. The Finnish bombshell, the German ultimatum and the Greek predicament combine to highlight how the euro crisis has shifted from a financial and economic disaster to a full-blown political crisis taxing the calibre of European leadership, by default most acutely in Berlin and in Paris. In January, the Greeks reacted to five years of wrenching austerity by electing leftwing radicals who rejected eurozone and creditor prescriptions in the name of democracy while still requiring bailout funds. But on the Baltic in April, in a mirror image of the Balkans, the Finns elected a rightwing nationalist government which \u2013 also in the name of democracy \u2013 declares it will not take part in any more bailouts. It is a catch-22 situation where the straitjacket of the euro regime is neither supple nor flexible enough to accommodate voters\u2019 political and policy choices. The euro\u2019s budgeting rules and the ECB\u2019s monetary stability mandate have long been seen as a one-size-fits-all problem denying diverging national economies the room to breathe. Since the debt crisis erupted in 2010, the response has been to enshrine austerity overall through fiscal pacts, debt brake rules, and a panoply of punitive options for sanctioning the miscreants and the recalcitrants. These fiscal measures have not been accompanied by the creation of political mechanisms or instruments that would even begin to try to reconcile the conflicting wishes of Finnish and Greek voters sharing the same currency. There have been half-hearted and half-baked calls for creating a separate eurozone chamber in the European parliament, for a new form of linkage between national and European parliaments. But they are going nowhere and in their recent big report on the future of the euro, the five presidents of the EU institutions kick the can down the road until 2025. Austerity is needed now. Democracy will have to wait.",

      "bodyText": "European leaders have confronted the Greek government with a draconian package of austerity measures entailing a surrender of fiscal sovereignty as the price of avoiding financial collapse and being ejected from the single currency bloc. A weekend of high tension that threatened to break Europe in two climaxed on Sunday night at a summit of eurozone leaders in Brussels where the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of France presented Greece\u2019s radical prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, with an ultimatum. In what a senior EU official described as an \u201cexercise in extensive mental waterboarding\u201d to secure Greek acquiescence to talks on a third bailout in five years worth up to \u20ac86bn (\u00a362bn), the two leaders pressed for absolute certainty from Tsipras that he would honour what was on offer. Two days of high-stakes negotiations between the finance ministers of the currency bloc resulted in a four-page document that included controversial German elements leaked on Saturday. Those measures included Greece leaving the euro temporarily by taking a \u201ctime-out\u201d from the currency bloc if it refuses terms for talks on the new bailout or, in the event of agreement, that Greece sets aside \u20ac50bn worth of assets as collateral for new loans and for eventual privatisation. Both passages, however, did not enjoy a consensus among eurozone leaders. Under the terms set before Tsipras on Sunday night, the Greek parliament has to endorse the entire package on Monday and then pass several pieces of legislation by Wednesday, including on pensions reform and a new VAT regime, before the eurozone will agree to negotiate a new three-year rescue package. The terms are much stiffer than those imposed by the creditors over the past five years. This, said the senior official, was payback for the emphatic no to the creditors\u2019 terms delivered by the snap referendum that Tsipras staged a week ago. \u201cHe was warned a yes vote would get better terms, that a no vote would be much harder,\u201d said the senior official. The Eurogroup document said experts from the troika of creditors \u2013 the International Monetary Fund, European Commission and European Central Bank \u2013 would be on the ground in Athens to monitor the proposed bailout programme. The trio would also have a say in all relevant Greek draft legislation before it is presented to parliament. Furthermore, the Greeks will have to amend all legislation already passed by the Syriza government this year that had not been agreed with the creditors. While Greece\u2019s fate was being debated in Brussels, in Athens the ruling leftwing Syriza party was showing signs of disintegration. Demands that the reforms be approved by the Greek government and put into law by Wednesday were described as \u201cutter blackmail\u201d by leading party members and met with disbelief. Although sources close to Tsipras said the leader was determined to do whatever was needed to keep Grexit at bay, political tumult also beckoned. Insiders conceded that a cabinet reshuffle \u2013 removing ministers who had refused to vote the austerity package through parliament early on Saturday \u2013 could come as early as Monday. By late Sunday night it had become clear that Tsipras\u2019s U-turn on measures he had once spurned had produced a potentially far-reaching split. In addition to 17 MPs breaking ranks at the weekend \u2013 stripping his government of a working majority \u2013 15 other lawmakers also indicated they would not approve the agreement in its entirety. The resistance raises the spectre of Tsipras being forced to call fresh elections \u2013 a move described as potentially catastrophic for the country. \u201cGreece can bend up to a point,\u201d said Aristides Hatzis, a prominent political commentator. \u201cBut after that there is no bending, only breaking.\u201d Although billed as the last chance to secure \u201cthe ultimate agreement\u201d on the Greek debt crisis, the prospects of a grand political bargain to keep Greece in the eurozone are far from assured. Entering the leaders\u2019 meeting, Tsipras said he was looking for compromise: \u201cWe can reach an agreement if all parties want it.\u201d But France and Germany are split on their approach to the Greek question, while Finland could refuse outright to sign up to a third bailout for Greece. France\u2019s Hollande vowed to do everything possible to get an agreement on Sunday night, but Merkel said there wouldn\u2019t be an agreement at any cost. Other eurozone countries urged Germany to drop its objections. \u201cGrexit has to be prevented,\u201d said Jean Asselborn, the Luxembourg foreign minister. \u201cIt would be fateful for Germany\u2019s reputation in the EU and the world. \u201cGermany\u2019s responsibility is great. It\u2019s about not conjuring up the ghosts of the past,\u201d he told German newspaper S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung. \u201cIf Germany goes for Grexit, it will trigger a deep conflict with France. That would be a catastrophe for Europe.\u201d Italy\u2019s prime minister, Matteo Renzi, was expected to tell Merkel at the leaders\u2019 meeting that \u201cenough is enough\u201d and the eurozone should not humiliate Greece when it had already given up so much. Earlier on Sunday, eurozone finance ministers said they had made some progress after 14 hours of talks over two days and failing to reach any agreement on Saturday. \u201cWe have come a long way, solved a lot of issues, but some big issues still remain,\u201d said Jeroen Dijsselbloem, who chairs the Eurogroup of finance ministers. Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, cancelled an emergency full summit of the 28 countries that was to deal with the fallout from Greece\u2019s ejection, in order to give eurozone leaders a last chance to reach an accord saving Greece and forestalling what would be a devastating schism, sowing deep resentment and division between Europe\u2019s leaders. The intractable problem is that many governments do not trust the Greek government to implement a \u20ac12bn (\u00a38.6bn) programme of spending cuts and reforms that will be delivered as part of a bailout. Eurozone governments are seeking proof from Athens it can keep its promises, in exchange for agreeing to start talks on a deal. \u201cThe main obstacle to an agreement is trust,\u201d said Pier Carlo Padoan, finance minister of Italy, one of the countries most sympathetic to Greece. The Irish taoiseach, Enda Kenny, urged his fellow leaders to \u201clook at the bigger picture\u201d. Kenny, who has been Ireland\u2019s leader since the early days of its own bailout programme, said in his country\u2019s case trust was built incrementally. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to look back in 10 years\u2019 time and think this could have been saved, but wasn\u2019t,\u201d he said. The German news magazine Der Spiegel called Sunday the biggest day of Merkel\u2019s 10-year chancellorship and appealed to her to \u201cshow greatness\u201d and save Europe. If Der Spiegel was right about the momentousness of Merkel\u2019s day, the same could be said for Hollande of France who, with his government and officials, has been campaigning tirelessly in recent weeks to keep Greece in the euro, helping Athens to draft its proposals. A decision to go ahead with a so-called Grexit, which has never been closer, would be a shattering failure for Hollande and the resulting Franco-German recrimination would be deeply damaging, say observers.",

Both passages, however, did not enjoy a consensus among eurozone leaders.</p> <p>Under the terms set before Tsipras on Sunday night, the Greek parliament has to endorse the entire package on Monday and then pass several pieces of legislation by Wednesday, including on pensions reform and a new VAT regime, before the eurozone will agree to negotiate a new three-year rescue package.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2015/jul/12/greece-crisis-we-must-ensure-advantages-outweigh-disadvantages-says-angela-merkel-video\"            data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/4at92\"                        data-video-id=\"2335961\"            data-video-name=\"Greece crisis: we must ensure advantages outweigh disadvantages, says Angela Merkel - video\"            data-video-provider=\"Reuters\"            data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2015/7/12/1436713846277/KP_352499_crop_640x360.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-457474532\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2015/7/12/1436713843576/KP_352499_crop_1200x720.jpg\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2015/07/12/120715Tspiris_desk.mp4\"></source><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2015/07/12/120715Tspiris.m3u8\"></source><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2015/07/12/120715Tspiris_synd_768k_vp8.webm\"></source><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2015/07/12/120715Tspiris_large.3gp\"></source><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2015/07/12/120715Tspiris_small.3gp\"></source> </video> <figcaption>Eurozone leaders say they are determined to try and find a solution to keep near-bankrupt Greece in the single currency on Sunday</figcaption> </figure>   <p>The terms are much stiffer than those imposed by the creditors over the past five years.

The trio would also have a say in all relevant Greek draft legislation before it is presented to parliament. Furthermore, the Greeks will have to amend all legislation already passed by the Syriza government this year that had not been agreed with the creditors.</p> <p>While Greece\u2019s fate was being debated in Brussels, in Athens the ruling leftwing Syriza party was showing signs of disintegration. Demands that the reforms be approved by the Greek government and put into law by Wednesday were described as \u201cutter blackmail\u201d by leading party members and met with disbelief. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/11/greeks-future-europe-austerity-eurozone\">Greeks resigned to a hard, bitter future whatever deal is reached with Europe</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Although sources close to Tsipras said the leader was determined to do whatever was needed to keep Grexit at bay, political tumult also beckoned.

After five years of battling to keep Greece in the eurozone, the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, is now warning that there cannot be a deal at any cost. A German government paper floated the idea of expelling Greece from the eurozone for at least five years. But France and Italy argue that Greece must be kept in the currency union, fearing Grexit would be a historic mistake that would damage the credibility of the entire European Union. Several countries that have recently emerged from their own painful austerity bailouts, such as Portugal and Ireland, want to ensure Greece signs up to credible reforms to get further help. Even if eurozone leaders agree on Sunday night to open talks on a \u20ac86bn (\u00a362bn)bailout for Greece, some national parliaments could still oppose the plan. Finland is certain to reject another bailout for Greece to avoid a schism that could topple its two-month-old government. Finland\u2019s refusal could embolden other eurozone members to block a deal, especially those in central Europea and the Baltic, which are proving to be the fiercest critics of the Greek government. Lithuania has hit out at what the Lithuanian president, Dalia Grybauskait\u0117, called Greece\u2019s \u201cma\u00f1ana\u201d approach to negotiations; Slovakia fears the eurozone could become a \u201czombie\u201d area if Greece stays. Potentially, eurozone governments could override Finland, or another small country, by resorting to an emergency voting procedure that requires only 85% of eurozone governments to support a bailout. But this could be politically explosive, as well as uncharted legal terrain. To use the special voting rule, eurozone leaders would have to agree that \u201cthe economic and financial sustainability\u201d of the eurozone is at stake. But many governments have spent weeks arguing exactly the opposite. Open to Grexit Germany: Angela Merkel has long sought to avoid going down in history as the German chancellor who presided over the breakup of the eurozone. But her government and many centre-right MPs are not convinced that Greece has done enough to justify a new three-year bailout. Austria: Austria has been consistently downbeat about the prospects for an agreement with Greece and thinks the risks of broader contagion to the rest of the eurozone from an exit are limited. The Netherlands: The Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, is a close ally of Merkel and wants Greece to come up with far-reaching reforms, otherwise \u201cit will be over quickly\u201d. Belgium: Although a champion of EU integration, Belgium\u2019s centre-right government is worried the eurozone\u2019s credibility would be damaged if agreements with Greece were changed. Finland: The nationalist Finns party has threatened to pull out of the ruling coalition and topple Finland\u2019s two-month old government if the country agrees to a third Greek bailout. Slovakia: An amicable split between Athens and its eurozone partners would be better than allowing Greece or the entire currency bloc to turn into a zombie state, argues Peter Ka\u017eim\u00edr, Slovakia\u2019s finance minister. Lithuania: Lithuania is the newest entrant to the eurozone and one of Greece\u2019s harshest critics. The president, Dalia Grybauskait\u0117, has said Greece\u2019s proposals are insufficient and based on outdated information. Latvia: The Latvian prime minister, Laimdota Straujuma, insists she will not sign up to any agreement that means writing down the value of Greece\u2019s debts, while the head of Latvia\u2019s central bank thinks Greece has already \u201cvoted itself out of the eurozone\u201d. Malta: \u201cWe need a solution but not at any cost,\u201d the prime minister, Joseph Muscat, has said. Malta is against reducing Greece\u2019s overall debt burden, but is prepared to make repayment terms more flexible. Wavering, but prefer to avoid Grexit Portugal: Portugal went through three years of painful austerity in exchange for a \u20ac78bn bailout. Although not in favour of Grexit, its liberal-conservative government opposes debt relief for Greece, arguing that Athens should get its house in order. Ireland: The taoiseach, Enda Kenny, has urged fellow European leaders to look at the bigger picture. But Ireland has swallowed its own bitter austerity medicine and is keen to ensure Greece does not get a no-strings bailout. Cyprus: With memories of its own chaotic \u20ac10bn bailout in 2013 still fresh, Cyprus hopes Greece will stay in the eurozone, but would like to see further reforms. Slovenia: Slovenia would like Greece to remain in the eurozone, but would like to see Athens sign up to verifiable reform measures to regain trust. Estonia: Along with its Baltic neighbours, Estonia has also taken a tough line with Greece. But Estonia\u2019s president, Toomas Hendrik Ilves, has warned that a Greek default could cost poorer eurozone members 4.2% of their GDP. Anything to avoid Grexit France: At the 11th hour of the debt crisis, France became Greece\u2019s champion. The French president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, is determined to strike a deal and thinks Europe\u2019s future is at stake. Italy: The Italian prime minister, Matteo Renzi, is determined to keep Greece in the eurozone and stop the \u201chumiliation\u201d of a European partner that has given up so much already. \u201cEnough is enough\u201d is the message he wants to convey to Germany. Spain: Madrid thinks keeping Greece in the euro is vital, but the centre-right government in Madrid will not want to make conditions too easy on Athens for fear of boosting the anti-austerity Podemos party. Luxembourg: Always a stalwart of European integration, Luxembourg argues that Germany has a responsibility to prevent Grexit. The foreign minister, Jean Asselborn, has said Grexit would trigger a deep conflict between Germany and France, which would be a catastrophe for Europe.",

      "bodyText": "Global corporations will think twice about investing in the UK while uncertainty reigns over Britain\u2019s European Union membership, according to the head of the Irish state body that has attracted Apple, Microsoft and Google to Ireland. Appealing to the UK to remain within the EU, Martin Shanahan, chief executive of the Republic\u2019s Industrial Development Authority, said \u201cit would be naive\u201d if overseas investors were not factoring in the possibility of the British leaving the EU when deciding where to locate new factories and plants. The IDA\u2019s chief said: \u201cSome of the foreign direct investment [FDI] only serves the UK market, which is a large market in itself, but some of it is to service a European market or the rest of the world. Some of those who are servicing a European market from the UK may choose to hedge their bets because of the referendum. They may wait until the referendum happens and do something only once there is an outcome.\u201d Drawing on more than 40 years\u2019 experience at the IDA in dealing with foreign corporations and creating hundreds of thousands of jobs by attracting global companies, Shanahan said: \u201cIt would be naive not to expect that investors are taking this [Brexit] into account and the prospect that the UK would not be part of the European Union. \u201cI am sure they [foreign investors], like everyone, are watching and may delay their decisions if they believe there is uncertainty about the UK\u2019s future in the EU. I think there is a possibility that people may delay an investment into the UK because of this uncertainty.\u201d On Ireland\u2019s prospects for bringing in new FDI, despite the abolition of the \u201cdouble Irish\u201d tax loophole that has allowed corporations to slash their overseas tax bills, Shanahan said its death knell announced in the Irish budget last year gave multinationals enough time to prepare for its abolition. The double Irish loophole allows US companies to reduce their tax bill far below Ireland\u2019s 12.5% corporate tax rate by shifting most of their taxable income from an operating company in Ireland to another Irish-registered firm in an offshore tax haven such as Bermuda. \u201cThere is a period where the companies can work out their arrangements over six years and I think for the most part these companies were extremely happy about the way that was handled.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Treasury select committee to question Carney on Greek crisis and interest rates", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, will face questions this week about the outlook for interest rates and the precarious situation in Greece when he becomes the first witness to appear before the new-look Treasury select committee. The parliamentary committee \u2013 one of the most influential in Westminster \u2013 will meet on Tuesday for the first time since the general election, the first opportunity for the new members to set out their agendas. The Conservative MP Andrew Tyrie remains its chairman after his reappointment was unopposed. He will be rejoined by fellow Tory MPs Mark Garnier and Steve Baker along with Labour MP John Mann. Reflecting the shape of the new parliament, the newly elected Scottish National party MP George Kerevan will question witnesses for the first time. Labour MPs Wes Streeting, Bill Esterson and Helen Goodman have also been elected to the committee alongside the Conservatives Jacob Rees-Mogg and Chris Philp. Carney will give evidence alongside a team of policymakers from the Bank, includingthe deputy governor Sir Jon Cunliffe and members of its monetary policy committee (MPC) and financial policy committee. The FPC was set up by the coalition government as part of a series of regulatory changes and is tasked with looking for the next risks to financial stability. The Bank warned this month that the Greek debt crisis posed a potential risk to the financial system if it caused a blow to investor confidence and therefore froze buying and selling of certain assets. It also raised a number of other concerns such the buoyancy of the buy-to-let housing sector and the situation in China, where growth has been slowing and stock markets have been tumbling in recent weeks. Tyrie has already indicated he intends to ask the Bank of England policymakers about the leverage ratio \u2013 a gauge of a bank\u2019s financial strength \u2013 following the publication of a consultation paper on Friday on how this key measure would operate. \u201cAs the last crisis demonstrated, taxpayers can be put at risk if bank failures lead to contagion. Huge bailout bills can await the taxpayer if banks are over-leveraged and undercapitalised. \u201cFor these reasons, the leverage ratio is an essential addition to the Bank\u2019s toolkit for improving the stability of the financial system. A good deal of judgment is needed in its implementation and it is crucial that the Bank exercises it.\u201d He added: \u201cThe Treasury committee will be asking questions of the Bank of England about the leverage ratio when they come to see the newly formed committee on Tuesday.\u201d The committee will also question policymakers about their latest economic forecasts made in the May inflation report, when the Bank cut the outlook for GDP and wage growth but insisted Britain\u2019s economic recovery remained solid. In the quarterly report, the MPC forecast that inflation, currently close to zero, would bounce back to its 2% target at the end of its two-year forecasting horizon. It predicted GDP growth of 2.5% in 2015, down from the 2.9% it was expecting in February, after the performance of the UK economy was weaker than expected in the first quarter. That cut was echoed last week by the government\u2019s fiscal watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility, which trimmed its growth forecast for 2015 to 2.4%, compared with the 2.5% pencilled in at the time of March\u2019s coalition government budget.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The numbers are mind-boggling. Ten days of falls on the Shanghai stock exchange resulted in losses that exceeded the GDP of Mexico. And 12 million Chinese citizens who opened share-trading accounts in May were nursing potentially ruinous losses. Margin trading \u2013 speculating on the stock exchange with borrowed money \u2013 increased five-fold in a year to 2.3tn yuan (\u00a3230bn). While Europe\u2019s focus has been the crisis in Greece, the Chinese stock market has been gripped by panic. The value of shares went up by 150% in little more than a year, then fell by 50% in just a few weeks. Fearful that China in 2015 could find itself in the history books along with Dutch tulips, the South Sea Bubble and the Wall Street Crash, the government in Beijing stepped in to halt the rout. It cut interest rates. It banned large shareholders from selling stock. It used public money to buy equities. It allowed trading in more than half the quoted companies to be halted. And, in the short term at least, it seems to have done the trick. Share prices rose at their fastest pace in more than seven years in the final two days of last week. Panic over, then? That\u2019s certainly what some China experts believe. They argue that the impact of the boom-bust in shares will have negligible impact on the real economy. Capital Economics, for example, notes that the rise in share prices did not lead to higher consumer spending, so why should the fall in share prices lead to lower consumer spending, particularly since most of the losers are high-net-worth individuals who can afford to take the hit? Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg, says the stock market plays little role in funding investment in China. This, he adds, is just one of the \u201cusual panics and manias to which young financial markets are even more prone than established ones\u201d. This optimistic assessment could well be correct. After all, the US suffered many boom-busts in the 19th century and they failed to arrest an upward trend that turned an agrarian economy in 1800 into the world\u2019s biggest industrial power by the outbreak of the first world war. Keynes once wrote: \u201cSpeculators may do no harm as bubbles on a steady stream of enterprise. But the position is serious when enterprise becomes the bubble on a whirlpool of speculation. When the capital development of a country becomes a by-product of the activities of a casino, the job is likely to be ill-done.\u201d China, if the optimists are right, is not a casino and the speculation is froth. Naturally enough, there is an alternative view, which is that the false and disorderly stock market is indicative of a deeper malaise, and that the current state of China is little different from the US in the years before the financial crash of 2007. Both appeared strong, both used inflated asset prices to stimulate growth and disguise fundamental weaknesses in the economy. Alan Greenspan dealt with the fallout from one burst bubble by inflating another. Something similar has been going on in China, where the response to the global financial crisis was to build inefficient industrial plant and infrastructure that was not really needed, while at the same time using cheap and over-abundant credit to boost property prices. Russell Jones at Llewellyn Consulting says periods of asset price excess are most serious when combined with a credit boom, and that China is the most obvious current example of such a phenomenon. Jones says the risk is that the Chinese authorities struggle to contain the stock market turbulence with the result that broader indicators of business and consumer confidence decline and GDP growth drops below the 7% target. There would, he adds, be a good chance that neighbouring countries, many of them also displaying bubble-like tendencies, would be affected. The Chinese authorities won plaudits for their handling of the 2008-09 crisis and may well emerge from this period of turbulence with their reputation intact. They will be helped by the fact that China runs a trade surplus, has strong public finances and has massive reserves. Even so, the lesson of history is that the worst crises are those where excessive credit has led to excessive leverage: investors throw caution to the wind and borrow money in the expectation that asset prices can only ever go up. This lesson holds true not just for the 2008-08 crash but \u2013 according to a 2010paper by an economic research body, the the National Bureau of Economic Research \u2013 for the whole era of modern finance capitalism. The authors of the paper studied the relationship between asset prices and the performance of the economy in 17 countries over 140 years and found that what turned a bit of irrational froth into something really nasty was when the irrational exuberance was combined with plenty of easy credit. This is where things in China start to look a bit worrying. The Bank for International Settlements, the body that represents central banks, has developed a set of indicators to assess whether countries are at risk of a financial crisis. One is whether the ratio of credit to national income (GDP) is more than 10% higher than its long-term trend. A second is whether real (inflation adjusted) share prices are more than 40% above their long-term trend. A third is whether property prices are more than 10% above their long-term trend. The results for China are not good. The credit gap rose from 12.7% to 14.2% in 2014. The equity gap remained only just below the 40% threshold following the boom in share prices in 2014 and early 2015. And the real property price gap was 10.5% in 2014, albeit down from 23.7% in 2014. China\u2019s leaders clearly have a problem. They understand that their country\u2019s growth model has to change and become less reliant on investment. Consumer spending has fallen from 50% of GDP \u2013 low by western standards \u2013 to 35% since Deng Xiaoping began his reform programme a little more than three decades ago. Moving to a model where growth is slower but of higher quality is not easy. As Bob Swarup of advisory firm Camdor Global, has noted, to maintain growth rates at the current target of just over 7% while returning household consumption to 50% of GDP within a decade would require consumer spending to rise by 11.5% a year. The task is complicated because China\u2019s authoritarian regime is fearful that economic distress will fuel political unrest. That\u2019s why there is always the strong temptation \u2013 even for a reformist administration like that of the premier, Li Keqiang, to resort to the old growth-at-any-price ways when things start to look a bit dicey. As they do now.",

That would be a catastrophe for Europe.\u201d</p> <p>The mood in Brussels was grim, sombre, and ugly. The stakes could not be higher. The weight of history seemed to rest on the shoulders of Chancellor Angela Merkel. If the German leader supports her finance minister\u2019s hard line later on Sunday, it may be that Greece cannot be saved.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Der Spiegel in Hamburg called it the biggest day of Merkel\u2019s 10-year chancellorship and appealed to her to \u201cshow greatness\u201d and save Europe. Matteo Renzi, the Italian prime minister, was said to be planning a bitter attack on Merkel, depending on the progress at the summit.

      "bodyText": "Europe braced itself for its most fateful day in years on Sunday as presidents, prime ministers, and chancellors congregated in Brussels for a summit to decide whether Greece remains in the euro single currency. Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, cancelled an emergency full summit of the 28 countries that was to deal with the fallout from Greece\u2019s ejection, in order to give eurozone leaders a last chance to reach an accord saving Greece and forestalling what would be a devastating schism sowing deep resentment and division between Europe\u2019s leaders. Eurozone finance ministers met on Sunday morning to try to reach agreement on launching talks on Greece\u2019s third bailout in five years after failing by midnight on Saturday to draft a common statement on the crisis. The eurozone\u2019s fiscal hawks, led by Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, the German finance minister, the Finns and the Slovaks, rejected new austerity measures conceded by Alexis Tsipras, the leftist Greek prime minister, and for the first time pushed openly for Greece to be allowed to collapse financially and ejected from the single currency. Arriving at the talks on Sunday, the finance minister of Finland, the country seen as one of the biggest doubters over a deal, said talks had a long way to go. \u201cIf this was a negotiation from one to 10, I think we are still standing somewhere from three to four,\u201d said Alexander Stubb, adding that Finland did not want to block an agreement. However, his scepticism was shared by ministers from the Baltic states and countries of central and eastern Europe. Slovakia\u2019s finance minister, Peter Ka\u017eim\u00edr, one of the most hawkish voices around the table, said he did not expect a deal on Sunday. But Jean Asselborn, the Luxembourg foreign minister, said: \u201cGrexit has to be prevented.\u201d He told the Munich newspaper S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung: \u201cIt would be fateful for Germany\u2019s reputation in the EU and the world. \u201cGermany\u2019s responsibility is great. It\u2019s about not conjuring up the ghosts of the past,. \u201cIf Germany goes for Grexit, it will trigger a deep conflict with France. That would be a catastrophe for Europe.\u201d The mood in Brussels was grim, sombre, and ugly. The stakes could not be higher. The weight of history seemed to rest on the shoulders of Chancellor Angela Merkel. If the German leader supports her finance minister\u2019s hard line later on Sunday, it may be that Greece cannot be saved. Der Spiegel in Hamburg called it the biggest day of Merkel\u2019s 10-year chancellorship and appealed to her to \u201cshow greatness\u201d and save Europe. Matteo Renzi, the Italian prime minister, was said to be planning a bitter attack on Merkel, depending on the progress at the summit. Renzi was to tell Germany enough is enough and that the EU could not flourish while member states were humiliated. If Der Spiegel is right about the momentousness of Merkel\u2019s day, the same could be said for President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of France who, with his government and officials, has been campaigning tirelessly in recent weeks to keep Greece in the euro, helping Athens to draft its proposals. A decision on so-called Grexit, which has never been closer, would be a shattering failure for Hollande and the resulting Franco-German recrimination will be deeply damaging. Saturday\u2019s talks between the 19 eurozone finance ministers in Brussels ended at midnight, with deep divisions persisting over whether to extend another bailout of up to \u20ac80bn to Greece in return for fiscal reforms. This morning\u2019s gathering will attempt to reconcile those differences ahead of the eurozone leaders\u2019 meeting. On Saturday, it was reported that Finland would not back a further bailout while it emerged that a German finance ministry paper had called for Greece to be turfed out of the currency bloc for at least five years. Experts from the group of creditors known as the troika - the European Commission, International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank - said fiscal rigour proposals from Athens were good enough to form \u201cthe basis for negotiations\u201d. But Sch\u00e4uble dismissed that view, supported by a number of northern and eastern European states. \u201cThese proposals cannot build the basis for a completely new, three-year [bailout] programme, as requested by Greece,\u201d said the German finance ministry document. It called for Greece to be expelled from the eurozone for a minimum of five years and demanded that the Greek government transfer \u20ac50bn of state assets to an outside agency for sell-off. Timo Soini, the nationalist True Finns leader, meanwhile, threatened to bring down the government in Helsinki if Stubb agreed to a new bailout for Greece. \u201cThe hawks are very vocal,\u201d said an EU diplomat. \u201cIt\u2019s very tough.\u201d Berlin also demanded stronger and more intrusive powers for outside monitors to police the economic and fiscal reforms that Alexis Tsipras, the leftist Greek prime minister, would need to commit to to secure the new bailout.

Progress has stalled amid huge scepticism that Greece would ever be able to deliver on its promises of reform. \u201cThe main obstacle to an agreement is trust,\u201d said Pier Carlo Padoan, finance minister of Italy, one of the countries most sympathetic to Greece. Valdis Dombrovksis, the European commissioner in charge of the euro, said it was \u201crelatively unlikely\u201d officials would get a mandate to start formal negotiations on a bailout programme under the European Stability Mechanism - the eurozone\u2019s \u20ac500bn bailout fund.

So far, 3,000 people have signed up on the site to bring packages in the UK. In Norway, most of the users are individuals who may be travelling from one side of the city or country to another and can take a package. The rest \u2013 which make up 60% of the deliveries \u2013 are either commercial operators such as delivery companies or a \u201cman with a van\u201d who have spare space in their vehicles, and people who travel for a living, such as salesmen.</p> <p>But what if the system is used to transport drugs?

      "bodyText": "When the Greeks are undergoing the worst economic hardship to affect any industrial nation for decades, it is characteristically tasteless of Chancellor George Osborne to go on about how, thanks to his \u201clong-term plan\u201d, we in Britain have been spared the fate of that unfortunate country. He was at it again on budget day. The truth is that Britain has been in no way threatened in the way Greece was in 2010. As shadow chancellor, Osborne opposed the recapitalisation of the banking system and the fiscal stimulus that \u201csaved the world\u201d. Luckily, the government at that time was in the hands of a man who, I am told, the present chancellor secretly admires, namely Gordon Brown. This does not prevent Osborne\u2019s acolytes in the press from informing us with glee that this latest budget, with its full-frontal assault on tax credits, is all part of the unravelling of Brown\u2019s painstaking attempt to alleviate poverty in this country. Osborne, who is riding high at the moment, knows he has much to thank Brown for, not least the granting of independence to the Bank of England and his predecessor\u2019s statesmanlike opposition to the belief \u2013 shared by most of the establishment at the time \u2013 that Britain should entered into the eurozone. He can also thank Brown for the fact that, after a long period of \u201cprudence\u201d with the nation\u2019s finances, he allowed sufficient growth in public spending to give Osborne the chance to conduct a propaganda coup in which he shamelessly encouraged the view that this had caused the banking crisis. When I saw the new production of The Importance of Being Earnest and again heard that great line \u201cthe chapter on the fall of the rupee you may omit \u2013 it is somewhat too sensational\u201d, a description from the adventure stories of my youth came to mind: \u201che is not quite 16 annas to the rupee\u201d was commonly used to describe someone you could not entirely trust. There was a classic example in the budget speech, when the chancellor gave the impression that, after all the worried lobbying by our defence chiefs and the Obama administration, we were going to honour the official Nato commitment to devoting 2% of our GDP to defence. Later, it appeared that this was only true if the \u201csecurity budget\u201d \u2013 MI5, MI6 etc \u2013 was included. Shiftiness is also there in the claim that the rise in the status of the minimum wage to the level of a \u201cliving wage\u201d will offset the damaging impact of the assault on tax credits and other spending on social security. As many a public organisation or charity at the coalface of the cuts will confirm, this is likely to be far from the case. Indeed, the Institute for Fiscal Studies has already made the point forcibly. For all the remarkably good press the chancellor initially had, this is not compassionate Conservatism or in the tradition of one-nation Conservatism. To take one example: the chancellor has been congratulated by some for his \u201cVictorian\u201d approach to the nation\u2019s finances, via his obsession with aiming for a budget surplus on both current and capital accounts. But there is also a kind of Victorian viciousness in the removal of tax credits for any beyond the second child. This is quite out of keeping with the spirit of the history of government help to families, which began with what were then called family allowances. Great Conservative figures such as Harold Macmillan and Ian Gilmour \u2013 much admired by our current prime minister \u2013 must be turning in their graves at this mean-minded policy. Budgets are meant to be about running the economy and appropriate fiscal policies. But this chancellor is into \u201csocial engineering\u201d. One recalls the time Mrs Thatcher said economics was \u201cthe method\u201d but the object was \u201cto change the heart and soul\u201d. Its early reception suggested that, for all one\u2019s concerns, this had been a clever budget. But it may well turn out in due course to have been too clever by half. I suspect that many of the people who are praising the chancellor now haven\u2019t got an inkling of what is likely to hit public services when we see the full horrors of the public spending review due in the autumn. On the general macroeconomic front there is much to be apprehensive about. The chancellor boasts about a Britain \u201cback in the black\u201d; in fact, we have a balance of payments deficit of 5.9% of GDP \u2013 the largest peacetime deficit since 1830 \u2013 the prospects for exports are not good, and the Office for Budget Responsibility\u2019s growth forecasts partly depend on yet another boom in personal credit. Moreover, people should not be deceived by all this stuff about revisions to his deficit reduction plans and the way he has taken note of OBR chairman Robert Chote\u2019s earlier warning about a \u201crollercoaster ride\u201d \u2013 so that now Chote talks of a \u201cbumpy ride\u201d. The \u201cplan\u201d remains: a guerrilla attack on the public sector, hurting the poor most, and partly based on a gross exaggeration of the degree to which the unemployed are \u201cworkshy\u201d.",

His successors as chief executive and chairman, Stuart Gulliver and Douglas Flint, were left to apologise in his place. But the long arm of the Lords will be feeling Green\u2019s ermine-lined collar on Tuesday, when Labour peer Clive Hollick, chair of the upper house\u2019s economic affairs committee, has invited him to have his say at a genteel-sounding session on \u201cbanking culture\u201d. No one expects the kind of dressing-down meted out by the MP Margaret Hodge to Green\u2019s former colleagues, but Hollick has promised to bring up the money laundering in Mexico and the tax dodging in Switzerland. After all, Green was at the helm during much of the misbehaviour that plunged the bank into a political and legal crisis, before sailing over to the House of Lords in 2010 to become David Cameron\u2019s first trade minister.

The new fashion credentials of Mike Ashley\u2019s discount sports chain are reaching the bottom line. For a lucky 2,500 Sports Direct workers, this means a bonus pot worth on average \u00a370,000 each is about to pay out. Full-year results on Thursday should confirm that the last profits target has been more than met. As part of an incentive scheme that began in 2011, earnings this year must reach \u00a3300m. The company forecasts \u00a3360m, and analysts agree. RBC has just upgraded shares to \u201coutperform\u201d, its second-highest recommendation. But the majority of staff are still on zero hours and bosses have yet to settle a claim from 300 people excluded from bonuses because they were tied to the controversial contracts.

Only six months ago he had even won the endorsement of the Archbishop of Canterbury for his efforts to install a moral compass inside Barclays \u2013 a bank that caused such outrage when it was fined \u00a3290m for rigging Libor that the government had to launch a parliamentary commission on banking standards. Even the bailout of the banking sector in 2008 had not sparked such a public inspection of bankers\u2019 ethics. Jenkins\u2019s job was to stop the wave of Barclays-bashing. Instead, he laid himself open to ridicule by installing huge clear blocks in the foyer of the headquarters emblazoned with the words respect, integrity, service, excellence and stewardship. We got management babble, such as his quest to create the \u201cgo-to bank\u201d. His Transform programme was an acronym: Turnaround, Return Acceptable Numbers, Sustain FORward Momentum. But by ousting him less than three years after his appointment, the Barclays board is entering dangerous territory. Look at what Sir Michael Rake, a longstanding Barclays boardroom director, said when forcing Jenkins out: \u201cNotwithstanding Antony\u2019s significant achievements, it became clear to all of us that a new set of skills were required for the period ahead.\u201d What does this mean? The only clue so far has come from John McFarlane, the chairman who is to take on the chief executive role for an indefinite period. He is putting his foot on the accelerator. The new goals will remind some of the gung-ho banking that led up to the crisis \u2013 double the share price in three or so years, be more aggressive in lending decisions, put more emphasis on Africa. And, it would appear, put more emphasis on the investment bank, which is as troublesome now as it was in the 1990s when Martin Taylor (now a policymaker at the Bank of England) broke it up \u2013 when it was Barclays de Zoete Wedd \u2013 and sold most of it off. In jettisoning BZW, however, Taylor paved the way for Bob Diamond to recreate it in the form of Barclays Capital, which generated billions of pounds in profits but has also been the source of the endless rows over jaw-dropping bonuses and multimillion-pound fines for rigging Libor rates and foreign exchange markets. Taylor admitted in 2012 that he wished in retrospect he had fired Diamond in 1998, when his division had almost imploded during the Russian debt crisis. With last week\u2019s events, however, it is the boring retail banker that is being jettisoned in favour of the new head of the investment bank, Tom King. And there lies the dilemma for the Barclays board, even if it has already insisted Jenkins\u2019s departure \u201cdoes not signal any major change in strategy\u201d. Jenkins had already announced a plan to scale back from the fixed-income, currencies and commodities trading (FICC in the City\u2019s jargon) for which the investment bank had become so well known under Diamond. Instead the focus is to be on serving customers and trading equities. The trouble is the transition has had a startling impact: the investment bank\u2019s return on equity has sunk to under 3%. Almost two decades on from Taylor\u2019s battle with investment banking, Barclays continues to face the question of how to combine it with a high-street operation that also needs surgery. The ringfencing requirements that come into force in 2019 are already forcing Barclays to rethink how it structures its high-street operations. So far McFarlane \u2013 who formally becomes executive chairman once he gets a nod from the Bank of England \u2013 seems to have the backing of investors. The shares are up 7% since Jenkins was ousted. But the clock is ticking to the end of the month, when McFarlane has promised a new plan \u2013 note, not a strategy \u2013 for the investment bank. It may not be long before McFarlane\u2019s halo also begins to lose its shine. The free market for energy is losing its power to convince The average energy customer is not king, according to the Competition and Markets Authority. The customer is a klutz. Foolish gas and electricity users just will not get off the sofa and switch to a lower-cost provider. Which is why domestic householders and others have overpaid the big six energy suppliers by \u00a38.5bn between 2009 and 2013, according to the CMA in its report issued last week. And the result is that transitional price caps will have to be introduced until the consumer knows how to behave properly. This is a national joke. The CMA knows what the real problem is, but as a protector of free-market orthodoxy it cannot bear to admit it: people do not want dozens of different providers and tariffs to choose from. They just want a local power provider whom they can trust not to rip them off while keeping the gas and electricity on. It is the same, largely, with schools, hospitals and even trains. It is not as though any of these power suppliers are offering anything different. The same therms and kilowatts move along the pipes and wires whether it is British Gas, SSE or a new independent such as Ovo Energy that sends out the bills. But what makes power more important than, say, mobile phone networks is that fuel poverty kills. Cold homes really do lead to thousands of fatalities every year, so an energy contract is not just another commercial transaction. The CMA argues that it is going to have to intervene (ever so reluctantly, it insists) to make sure that customers are not getting fleeced until people learn to switch providers and the market \u201cworks\u201d. The contradiction here, of course, is that if competition really was working properly then all the prices would converge on each other within a very small band, rather than the current 30% difference. Deregulation \u2013 privatisation and a free-for-all energy market \u2013 has been with us for quarter of a century, yet the CMA report underlines that companies, rather than customers, are the key beneficiaries. A worthwhile \u20ac400m for low-cost O\u2019Leary On the face of it, Ryanair\u2019s boss, Michael O\u2019Leary, suffered a rare defeat last week. The low-cost airline agreed to sell its near-30% stake in rival Aer Lingus to the owner of British Airways, after its attempted takeover of the former Irish flag carrier was stymied by competition watchdogs. As an investment, it has not been a spectacular success. Having spent \u20ac407m (\u00a3293m) on its shareholding, Ryanair will receive \u20ac406m and has pocketed \u20ac18m in dividends over the years. However, there is an argument that O\u2019Leary has boosted his airline financially by befuddling scores of Aer Lingus executives since launching the bid in 2006. Some industry executives believe the Ryanair boss ran rings round his biggest Irish competitor throughout the process, distracting Aer Lingus management from the day-to-day competitive battle against Ryanair. Yes, \u20ac407m is a big number for a penny-pincher like O\u2019Leary. But it was money well spent.",
