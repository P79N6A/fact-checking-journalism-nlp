      "bodyText": "David Cameron is facing a fresh clash with Tory Eurosceptics after dropping Britain's objections to the use of the European court of justice (ECJ) to enforce a new fiscal compact for the eurozone. Tory backbenchers met last night to prepare tactics ahead of a statement to parliament in which the prime minister will explain that Britain does not want to stand in the way of action to solve the eurozone crisis. Cameron told EU leaders at their summit in Brussels that Britain was unlikely to raise any objections to the use of the ECJ to police tough new fiscal rules for eurozone members. But he pledged to watch eurozone leaders \"like a hawk\" and to take legal action if they seek to use the court, or any other EU institution, to rewrite the rules of the single market. Britain will officially reserve its position until a new eurozone treaty is formally ratified after 25 members of the EU, bar the UK and the Czech Republic, endorsed the new measure last night. Speaking after the summit broke up, Cameron said: \"We don't want to hold up the eurozone doing whatever is necessary to solve the crisis, as long as it doesn't damage our national interests.\" The prime minister said he would monitor the implementation of the new treaty. \"It is in our national interest that the new treaty, outside the EU, does not encroach on the single market. We will be watching like a hawk. If there is any sign that they are going to encroach on the single market, then clearly we would take the appropriate action.\" Tory Eurosceptics accused the prime minister of annulling his vetoing of a revision of the Lisbon treaty last December, which prevented eurozone leaders from embedding the compact in the architecture of the EU. Bernard Jenkin, the veteran Eurosceptic, said: \"This nullifies the effect of the UK's veto in December and demonstrates how a subset of EU member states can hijack the EU institutions for their own purposes, bypassing any dissenting state \u2026 The government cannot retreat from that now, or they will refuel demands for a referendum on the UK's present terms of membership of the EU.\" The prime minister dismissed Jenkin's criticism as bizarre. \"There isn't a Brussels EU treaty because I vetoed it. They [eurozone leaders] have had to make a treaty outside the EU. Obviously they'd prefer to have it inside the EU, which is why they are already talking about trying to bring it back inside the EU. So to argue that the veto doesn't matter seems bizarre.\" Cameron added that eurozone leaders need to step up their efforts to rescue the euro. \"Our national interest is that these countries get on and sort out the mess that is the euro.\" Conservative MEPs, who met the prime minister in Brussels before the start of yesterday's summit, blamed Nick Clegg for forcing Cameron to change his mind. Martin Callanan, the group's leader, said: \"I blame a combination of appeasing Nick Clegg, who is desperate to sign anything the EU puts in front of him, and the practical reality that this pact is actually quite hard to prevent.\" The Liberal Democrats will say they have achieved an important victory. The deputy prime minister, who was alarmed by Cameron's use of the veto, made clear in December that the EU's institutions would have to be put at the disposal of eurozone leaders. As recently as 6 January the prime minister voiced doubts about the ECJ when he said that it \"tends to come down on the side of whatever 'more Europe' involves\". Labour added to the pressure on the prime minister by saying that his change of heart on the use of EU institutions showed that his actions in December had amounted to a \"phantom veto\". Douglas Alexander, the shadow foreign secretary, said: \"The unanswered question after this summit remains what exactly David Cameron achieved by walking out of the EU negotiations last month? With the EU institutions now involved, it seems clear that all his earlier phantom veto achieved was to undermine British influence, and make it harder for Britain to protect its own interests in Europe and push for an effective solution to the eurozone's problems.\" The prime minister sought to maintain the focus on the formal agenda of yesterday's summit \u2013 how to promote growth across the EU. He was given a taste of the challenge when Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, the president of the European commission, said Britain had the same number of young unemployed people as Spain, where almost one in two young people who are available for work is unemployed. In a slide presentation, Barroso told the summit: \"You can also see that the number of young unemployed is close to 1 million in Spain and in the UK. While the UK percentage is lower, 1 million unemployed young people is a big problem.\"",

      "body": "<p><strong> </strong></p> <p>Sir Fred Goodwin and other Royal Bank of Scotland executives criticised in December's 450-page Financial Service Authority report are \"not fit\" to run a bank and will never again work in regulated financial services, according to Britain's top regulator.</p> <p>Hector Sants, chief executive of the Financial Services Authority, said that although no enforcement action had been taken against them, in his opinion, executives responsible for a catalogue of disastrous decisions leading to the near-failure of RBS in 2008 would be effectively blackballed.</p> <p>The FSA has struck a formal agreement with RBS's former head of investment banking Johnny Cameron in which it has dropped enforcement action against him after he undertook not to work again in a senior banking role.</p> <p>Asked about Goodwin and other RBS executives criticised in the FSA's report, Sants said: \"In my personal judgement there were a set of failings, over a long period, by the executives of RBS. And in my judgment that means they are not fit to run a regulated institution\u2026 these people will not work again in the regulated sector, in my opinion.\"</p> <p>He explained that the regulator had taken no formal decision on this as none of those concerned had applied for authorisation. He nevertheless insisted he was confident any such appointment would be blocked.</p> <p>Sants said that while the legal threshold for incompetence which would trigger enforcement action was very high, it was less so when it came to reviewing an individual's suitability to operate in regulated financial services.</p> <p>The prime minister earlier this month revealed he had asked the honours committee to examine whether Goodwin could be stripped of his knighthood for bringing RBS to its knees. The bank was rescued with taxpayer funds and is now 82% owned by the state.</p> <p>Sants also gave a robust defence of his record at the FSA, accusing his predecessor John Tiner of ignoring concerns raised about the lack of expert regulation of British-based investment banks in 2007.</p> <p>Sants told the Treasury Select Committee he \"complained\" to Tiner repeatedly about the \"silo structure\" the former FSA boss had deliberately cultivated.</p> <p>Until his promotion to chief executive in July 2007, Sants reminded the MPs, this structure meant he had only been responsible for regulating overseas investment banks such as Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank and Morgan Stanley.</p> <p>Despite its aggressive push into investment banking from 2005 until the credit crunch hit in 2007, Royal Bank of Scotland was not supervised by Sants and his team. Instead, RBS was regulated as a retail bank by his colleague Clive Briault.</p> <p>Sants said his investment bank supervisory team \"had considerable expertise and they were not able to share that with regulators in the UK banks department\".</p> <p>Sants said he had expressed his views about \"weak management\" in Briault's division at regular meetings with Tiner, but the then FSA boss had told him he was happy with the structure as it was. Sants recalled: \"We were not encouraged to question or debate across the silos. The chief executive did not encourage any discussion.\"</p> <p>One MP said this was astonishing, to which Sants replied: \"I agree with you.\" Another member of the committee suggested Sants was \"dumping on your predecessor\" in an effort to avoid responsibility. Sants denied this.</p> <p>As soon as he was promoted to FSA chief executive in July 2007, Sants claimed he set about a radical overhaul of the regulators' structure. \"If you are an integrated regulator, it doesn't make sense not to have an integrated structure,\" he told MPs. He further claimed to have \"asked for the resignation\" of Briault \"as soon as possible\". The FSA chief executive suggested the regulators could possibly have intervened to stop RBS's ill-fated acquisition of part of Dutch rival ABN Amro in 2007, but after he became chief executive such a move was impossible.</p> <p>Even at the eleventh hour, Sants credited himself for \"having the guts to consider\" the risks involved in the takeover. By the time he was leading the FSA, however, a review of the deal found there were not sufficient legal grounds to step in.</p> <p>Also giving evidence to the select committee was FSA chairman Lord Turner. He noted that although the report into RBS was extensive \u2013 and was likely to be followed by a similar report into HBOS \u2013 it was a good way short of the kind of comprehensive report into the 2008 banking crisis that had been conducted by the US Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission. He said: \"You could argue, winding the clock back, we ought to have had a Royal Commission.\"</p>", 
      "bodyText": "Sir Fred Goodwin and other Royal Bank of Scotland executives criticised in December's 450-page Financial Service Authority report are \"not fit\" to run a bank and will never again work in regulated financial services, according to Britain's top regulator. Hector Sants, chief executive of the Financial Services Authority, said that although no enforcement action had been taken against them, in his opinion, executives responsible for a catalogue of disastrous decisions leading to the near-failure of RBS in 2008 would be effectively blackballed. The FSA has struck a formal agreement with RBS's former head of investment banking Johnny Cameron in which it has dropped enforcement action against him after he undertook not to work again in a senior banking role. Asked about Goodwin and other RBS executives criticised in the FSA's report, Sants said: \"In my personal judgement there were a set of failings, over a long period, by the executives of RBS. And in my judgment that means they are not fit to run a regulated institution\u2026 these people will not work again in the regulated sector, in my opinion.\" He explained that the regulator had taken no formal decision on this as none of those concerned had applied for authorisation. He nevertheless insisted he was confident any such appointment would be blocked. Sants said that while the legal threshold for incompetence which would trigger enforcement action was very high, it was less so when it came to reviewing an individual's suitability to operate in regulated financial services. The prime minister earlier this month revealed he had asked the honours committee to examine whether Goodwin could be stripped of his knighthood for bringing RBS to its knees. The bank was rescued with taxpayer funds and is now 82% owned by the state. Sants also gave a robust defence of his record at the FSA, accusing his predecessor John Tiner of ignoring concerns raised about the lack of expert regulation of British-based investment banks in 2007. Sants told the Treasury Select Committee he \"complained\" to Tiner repeatedly about the \"silo structure\" the former FSA boss had deliberately cultivated. Until his promotion to chief executive in July 2007, Sants reminded the MPs, this structure meant he had only been responsible for regulating overseas investment banks such as Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank and Morgan Stanley. Despite its aggressive push into investment banking from 2005 until the credit crunch hit in 2007, Royal Bank of Scotland was not supervised by Sants and his team. Instead, RBS was regulated as a retail bank by his colleague Clive Briault. Sants said his investment bank supervisory team \"had considerable expertise and they were not able to share that with regulators in the UK banks department\". Sants said he had expressed his views about \"weak management\" in Briault's division at regular meetings with Tiner, but the then FSA boss had told him he was happy with the structure as it was. Sants recalled: \"We were not encouraged to question or debate across the silos. The chief executive did not encourage any discussion.\" One MP said this was astonishing, to which Sants replied: \"I agree with you.\" Another member of the committee suggested Sants was \"dumping on your predecessor\" in an effort to avoid responsibility. Sants denied this. As soon as he was promoted to FSA chief executive in July 2007, Sants claimed he set about a radical overhaul of the regulators' structure. \"If you are an integrated regulator, it doesn't make sense not to have an integrated structure,\" he told MPs. He further claimed to have \"asked for the resignation\" of Briault \"as soon as possible\". The FSA chief executive suggested the regulators could possibly have intervened to stop RBS's ill-fated acquisition of part of Dutch rival ABN Amro in 2007, but after he became chief executive such a move was impossible. Even at the eleventh hour, Sants credited himself for \"having the guts to consider\" the risks involved in the takeover. By the time he was leading the FSA, however, a review of the deal found there were not sufficient legal grounds to step in. Also giving evidence to the select committee was FSA chairman Lord Turner. He noted that although the report into RBS was extensive \u2013 and was likely to be followed by a similar report into HBOS \u2013 it was a good way short of the kind of comprehensive report into the 2008 banking crisis that had been conducted by the US Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission. He said: \"You could argue, winding the clock back, we ought to have had a Royal Commission.\"",

Stephen Hester could be forgiven for noting how little political fuss accompanied the award of a \u00a31.5m bonus in 2010 to Adam Crozier for his efforts as chief executive of the Royal Mail. There are differences, of course. For a start, Crozier's bonus represented the flowering of a three-year incentive scheme; Hester's near-\u00a31m bonus was for a single year's performance and he remains a member of a long-term scheme. On the other hand, fixing Royal Bank of Scotland is probably a stiffer challenge even than modernising the Royal Mail. The point is that the government needs to decide how to treat pay and bonuses at nationalised and semi-nationalised companies that wish to recruit executives from the private sector. In RBS's case, there will be a row every January until the bank is sold \u2013 indeed, there will be more argy-bargy within weeks when executives below board level are handed their winnings. Doing nothing, while praying that Ed Miliband doesn't table a Commons motion, is not a policy.",

For a start, Crozier's bonus represented the flowering of a three-year incentive scheme; Hester's near-\u00a31m bonus was for a single year's performance and he remains a member of a long-term scheme. On the other hand, fixing Royal Bank of Scotland is probably a stiffer challenge even than modernising the Royal Mail.</p> <p>The point is that the government needs to decide how to treat pay and bonuses at nationalised and semi-nationalised companies that wish to recruit executives from the private sector. In RBS's case, there will be a row every January until the bank is sold \u2013 indeed, there will be more argy-bargy within weeks when executives below board level are handed their winnings.

      "bodyText": "Pressure on EU leaders to relax their insistence on strict austerity measures intensified on Monday after Spain revealed that its economy contracted in the last three months of 2011 and the cost of insuring Portugal's debt soared to a record high. Spain's output dropped by 0.3% during the fourth quarter of 2011 compared with the previous three months, according to official data, confirming the view of the prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, that the economy is sliding into recession. The figures followed unemployment data last week that shocked EU politicians after it revealed a 350,000 rise in the total out of work, taking the jobless rate to 22.8% and above 5 million. Madrid said it wanted officials in Brussels to discuss how countries such as Spain can grow before any agreements are reached on further austerity measures. The economy is expected to slide further in the first quarter of this year, placing Spain in its second recession in less than three years. A technical recession is defined as two consecutive quarters of contraction. The figure announced by the Spanish statistical office, INE, broke a run of seven quarters without economic contraction. Compared with a year earlier, gross domestic product rose 0.3%, the INE said. For all of 2011, it increased 0.7%. Portugal's slide towards a Greek-style second bailout accelerated after its principal private lenders indicated that they were growing weary of assurances from Lisbon that it could get on top of the country's debts. Business and consumer confidence also hit record lows, following a string of pay cuts and across-the-board tax hikes that were part of Portugal's painful austerity programme. Banks and others offering insurance against default to holders of Portuguese sovereign debt have begun demanding huge payments upfront rather than allowing costs to be spread over the term of the contract. This means that it costs \u20ac3.95m (\u00a33.3m) to insure \u20ac10m in bonds over five years, payable now. Analysts said that this made Portugal the second most costly sovereign debt to insure in the world, after Greece, and implied a huge lack of confidence in market circles about Lisbon's future. Portuguese bonds have come under particularly intense pressure from investors after Standard &amp; Poor's downgraded 15 eurozone countries earlier this month, putting Portugal in the \"junk\" category. Portugal's 10-year bond yields surged on Monday to just under 16%, more than twice the level that is generally considered unsustainable. John Higgins and Ben May, economists at Capital Economics, said Portugal would be forced out of the single currency, probably next year. Capital Economics has already predicted Greece will leave in 2012. \"The surge in yields in Portugal, which has taken place since the country's credit rating was lowered to sub-investment grade earlier this month by Standard &amp; Poor's ratings agency, reflects growing scepticism that private-sector involvement in eurozone sovereign debt restructurings will only be applied in the case of Greece,\" they said in a report. Business and consumer confidence nudged higher on average across the EU despite the fall in Portugal, though analysts were hard-pressed to explain why sentiment had improved this month against a backdrop of huge anxiety while negotiations continued in Athens over the fate of Greece and talks over closer fiscal unity were undermined by Britain's use of its opt-out. UK consumer confidence rose, according to the Mmarket research firm GfK NOP, though it remains \"seriously depressed\". Nick Moon, managing director of GfK NOP Social Research, said falls in inflation and energy prices were behind the rise. He said the feel-good factor may return with added strength with the arrival of the Olympics and the Queen's diamond jubilee, which could improve expectations for the economy and people's own finances.",

Having seen markets hold on to the gains from the previous two weeks on the back of EU officials promises that a deal was close; the lack of any progress over the weekend has seen the markets deliver its verdict and it's rather damning, with the FTSE hitting its lowest levels in nearly two weeks. Friction between Germany and Greece over increased budget oversight hasn't helped sentiment either. EU leaders gathered at a summit in Brussels have just agreed on a permanent ESM bailout mechanism to come into effect from July but will sign a treaty at a later stage, Reuters reported.

      "bodyText": "British luxury brand Belstaff is paying a record \u00a33m for a new store on Bond Street in London as the upmarket street cements its position as a shopping destination for wealthy tourists. Property experts said Belstaff \u2013 which is worn by celebrities such as Angelina Jolie, Johnny Depp and Victoria Beckham \u2013 had set a \"record\" for the highest rent paid on Bond Street for a new open market letting. The brand, part of the Labelux group that also owns Jimmy Choo, has taken a 20-year lease on the entire six storey building, which is to be renamed \"Belstaff House\". The retail space totals 25,000 sq ft and the store's neighbours will include high-end fashion brands including Miu Miu and Fendi. While high street chains on nearby Oxford Street struggle, sales in the luxury sector have remained buoyant thanks to the influx of high-spending tourists from fast-growing economies such as China. \"This letting demonstrates the demand from global luxury brands for major flagship stores on Bond Street,\" said Charlie Hammond of property firm HDG, which manages the asset on behalf of a private investor. \"It also highlights the sustained importance of Bond Street to the luxury sector and its continued buoyancy.\" Belstaff, which was founded in Longton, near Stoke-on-Trent, in 1924, originally produced heavy-duty clothing for motorcyclists and lays claim to making the world's first waxed cotton jackets. At one time it produced more than 80,000 jackets a year, which were worn by bikers the world over, including the late Steve McQueen, star of The Great Escape. The label also provided clothing for Lawrence of Arabia, with Peter O'Toole as Lawrence dying on his motorbike wearing a Belstaff jacket. Until last year the company was owned by the Malenotti family, which has ties to both the motorbike and film industries: it was being run by Franco Malenotti, a motorbike designer and champion rider, while his father Maleno was a film producer and a peer of Federico Fellini.

      "body": "<p>British luxury brand Belstaff is paying a record \u00a33m for a new store on Bond Street in London as the upmarket street cements its position as a shopping destination for wealthy tourists.</p> <p>Property experts said Belstaff \u2013 which is worn by celebrities such as Angelina Jolie, Johnny Depp and Victoria Beckham \u2013 had set a \"record\" for the highest rent paid on Bond Street for a new open market letting. The brand, part of the Labelux group that also owns Jimmy Choo, has taken a 20-year lease on the entire six storey building, which is to be renamed \"Belstaff House\". The retail space totals 25,000 sq ft and the store's neighbours will include high-end fashion brands including Miu Miu and Fendi.</p> <p>While high street chains on nearby Oxford Street struggle, sales in the luxury sector have remained buoyant thanks to the influx of high-spending tourists from fast-growing economies such as China. \"This letting demonstrates the demand from global luxury brands for major flagship stores on Bond Street,\" said Charlie Hammond of property firm HDG, which manages the asset on behalf of a private investor. \"It also highlights the sustained importance of Bond Street to the luxury sector and its continued buoyancy.\"</p> <p>Belstaff, which was founded in Longton, near Stoke-on-Trent, in 1924, originally produced heavy-duty clothing for motorcyclists and lays claim to making the world's first waxed cotton jackets. At one time it produced more than 80,000 jackets a year, which were worn by bikers the world over, including the late Steve McQueen, star of The Great Escape. The label also provided clothing for Lawrence of Arabia, with Peter O'Toole as Lawrence dying on his motorbike wearing a Belstaff jacket.</p> <p>Until last year the company was owned by the Malenotti family, which has ties to both the motorbike and film industries: it was being run by Franco Malenotti, a motorbike designer and champion rider, while his father Maleno was a film producer and a peer of Federico Fellini. As a result of its ownership the clothes were being made Italy but Labelux is returning Belstaff to its English roots. \"The brand started in England,\" said its chief executive Harry Slatkin in <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/fashion/news/belstaff-the-stars-favourite-returns-to-rugged-british-roots-6296343.html\" title=\"\">a weekend interview with the Independent</a>. \"When it was bought by Italians [in the 1990s], it started to lose its way and lose its language.

Look at Monday's consumer confidence figures from NOP for the EU. They're higher than December. An explanation for the slight rise in sentiment is hard to find. No matter, it fits with general picture of lifting gloom. A fall in Italian interest rates on 10-year bond yields put a smile on traders' faces at another \"successful\" debt auction. Demand for Spanish debt was also up. Italy now pays less than 6% and Spain less than 5%. Yet while 30 January might be \"the happiest Monday of the year\", according to David Holmes, a senior psychologist at Manchester Metropolitan University, this early spring euphoria smacks of desperation. The Spanish and Italian prime ministers are in Brussels on Monday begging for the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, to relent on austerity or risk social unrest that could see them both toppled. The stakes are high. Italians are prepared to riot rather than accept huge cuts in their incomes to save German banks. It is one thing to make sacrifices to save your own banks, but another country's? Spanish protesters have so far preferred a more peaceful route. But now there is a rightwing government in place, no one can say if violence is not the next step. Germany is under pressure because all the real economic figures are going the wrong way. Spain's economy has contracted for the first time in two years. Its unemployment record is now the worst in the eurozone at 22.8%. Greece's public spending cuts are pushing the economy further into recession. In Portugal, business and consumer confidence has hit a record low, the latter battered by the lower salaries and across-the-board tax hikes that were part of Portugal's painful austerity programme. Portugal is sliding towards becoming the next Greece \u2013 needing a second bailout to avoid chaotic bankruptcy. Banks have raised the cost of insuring government bonds against default and insisted the money be paid upfront instead of over years. It now costs a record \u20ac3.9m (\u00a33.3m) to insure \u20ac10m of Portuguese debt. How can anyone be cheery with all this going on? The Brussels elite are preparing a statement that will declare their sympathies for the EU's 23 million unemployed and a token gesture of cash to help out. But they and the markets are, as usual, deluded. On Monday morning, a spokesman for the right-wing FDP, which is Merkel's main coalition partner, said he could not make the terms for Greece, or any other indebted country, easier because that would mean explaining to the German public its money would take longer to be paid back or not be paid back at all. Maybe, once the French election is out of the way, the German treasury will back cheaper interest rates for indebted countries through eurobonds. Maybe higher fiscal transfers will be forthcoming, which will add up to bigger debt write-offs. But the magnitude of the debt write-offs needed for Ireland and Portugal, as well as Greece, have yet to be factored into the euro equation.",

I am sure they have a lot to hide \u2013 that is why they refuse to publish it.\"</p>",

The dispute centres on shares issued to 10 executives under the company's long term incentive plan this month and will pay out if the airline meets what Haji-Ioannou described as a \"phoney\" return on capital employed (ROCE), a measure of how efficiently a business invests its capital. He believes the way easyJet calculates ROCE delivers a figure three times higher than the rate of return using a different method of calculation. The company reckons the payout is justified as the airline performed well in 2011. Late last year easyJet paid its first dividend after full-year profit rose by one third. Haji-Ioannou, who founded easyJet in 1995 but quit the airline's board in 2010 after a row over strategy, also took the opportunity, once again, to attack the airline's decision to buy new planes from Airbus: \"I would also continue to insist on any new directors stopping the current practice of buying oversized, technically obsolete and over-priced aircraft from Airbus to service non-existent new routes. \"The $1.3bn (\u00a3830m) order of January 2011 placed just before the profit warning was a big mistake. These Airbuses are simply not required in the current difficult economic climate in Europe and will destroy shareholder value. If Mike Rake [easyJet's chairman] thinks otherwise, he can publish the profitability by aircraft before the AGM. I am sure they have a lot to hide \u2013 that is why they refuse to publish it.\"",

He added: \"Banks need to be careful, the media is out for blood this bonus season, and are backed by politicians.\" Mark Field, the Conservative MP for the City of London and Westminster, said Hester had been \"vilified\" and warned that the intense row would put the best candidates off running the majority state-owned bank in the future. \"I want to make sure we've got the brightest and best people on board to protect our bank,\" he told the BBC Today programme. \"Who is going to want to take that job going forward?\" David Fleming, Unite national officer, said: \"Better late than never will be the feeling amongst the call centre, bank branch and processing staff at RBS that Stephen Hester has finally bowed to public pressure to waive his nearly \u00a31 million bonus. This gesture goes some way to acknowledging the hypocrisy of an organisation which has sacked over 21,000 staff, while still attempting to pay bumper bonuses to the bosses. \"As Unite demanded at the time the bonus was announced it was right for common sense to prevail and this massive bonus to be waived. There remains a long way for RBS to go in proving its credentials as a responsible organisation, to its customers and also to its thousands of staff.\"",

      "standfirst": "As row over his financial rewards package grew, calls from the opposition for a Commons vote forced Stephen Hester's hand", 
      "body": "<p>It is probably a painful thought for Stephen Hester in his Swiss hideaway, but the fate of his \u00a3963,000 bonus was decided days ago, elsewhere, thousands of feet up in the Swiss Alps among the masters of world capitalism.</p> <p>As he flitted between a series of meetings in Davos on Friday, Ed Miliband developed a plan to call a parliamentary vote to force the UK Financial Investments to vote against the bonus.</p> <p>The plan, forged in a series of emails with the shadow business secretary, Chuka Umunna, and the chief whip, Rosie Winterton, was launched early on Sunday evening. Within hours, as ministers made clear in private they would find it difficult to support the bonus, Hester threw in the towel.</p> <p>Miliband believes Hester's move ranks with the decision last summer by News Corp to shelve its bid to take full control of BSkyB shortly before a Commons vote, called by Labour, to block the bid. The Labour leader also regards the Hester decision as a key moment in his campaign to shape what he is calling responsible capitalism. It is, Miliband hopes, a dreadful moment for David Cameron, who appears to be out of touch with public sentiment weeks after he outlined his vision to create a form of popular capitalism.</p> <p>In welcoming Hester's announcement, Miliband turned his fire on the prime minister. \"Stephen Hester has done the right thing,\" the Labour leader said. \"It is a shame that a feeble, out of touch David Cameron did not realise he should do the right thing and stand up for the interests of the British people.</p> <p>\"Labour was right to seek a parliamentary vote on this so that the people's voice could be heard. But the debate about fair executive pay and responsible capitalism is only just beginning. We need a government that will tax bankers' bonuses and bring responsibility to the boardroom.\"</p> <p>The announcement by Hester capped a difficult 72 hours for Cameron and George Osborne, who appear to have underestimated the strength of public feeling. Downing Street, which clocked weeks ago that Hester's bonus would have to be reduced, had confidently predicted that he would receive less than \u00a31m.</p> <p>Sources felt keeping the Hester bonus below the symbolically significant figure of \u00a31m would be tricky to sell but just about manageable on two grounds. These were that the RBS chief executive had increased business lending over the past year and had reduced the RBS balance sheet by \u00a30.5tn, thereby reducing the taxpayers' liability.</p> <p>But the timing of the bonus was unfortunate. Just a week before the announcement, Cameron outlined his ideas on how to create what he called popular capitalism. He said this fitted in a Tory tradition, dating back to Edmund Burke and Benjamin Disraeli, unlike Labour, which veered between promoting economic socialism or championing the super-rich.</p> <p>The prime minister's key phrase came back to haunt him last week, when his description of New Labour's approach to the rich appeared to describe today's state-controlled banks. Cameron said of New Labour's time in office: \"The City, which should have been a powerhouse of competition and creativity, became instead a byword for a sort of financial wizardry that left the taxpayer with all the risk, and a fortunate few with all of the rewards. So instead of popular capitalism we ended up with unpopular capitalism.\"</p> <p>Downing Street and the Treasury embarked on an aggressive operation when it became clear that the Hester bonus was deeply unpopular. On Thursday and Friday last week Downing Street said that ministers were bound by a contract negotiated by the last Labour government.</p> <p>Miliband's office moved quickly to quash that argument. Officials contacted Lord Myners, the Treasury minister in the last government who negotiated the Hester contract. Myners confirmed that the bonus was discretionary.</p> <p>\"There is nothing in the employment contract of Stephen Hester or any director of Royal Bank of Scotland which binds the company or its remuneration committee to pay a mandatory bonus,\" Myners said. \"All matters relating to bonuses are at the full discretion of the board of directors and the shareholders, including UKFI, who have elected them.\"</p> <p>Within hours the government embarked on a different tack. As Miliband was drawing up his plans in Davos, a short distance away in the Alpine resort Osborne hinted the government had been forced to act after a threat of resignations by the RBS board if the bonus was not approved. Government sources said Sir Philip Hampton, the RBS chairman who turned down a \u00a31.4m bonus, was particularly vociferous on behalf of Hester. Cameron came close to acknowledging that the government could have faced resignations on Saturday afternoon at Chequers. He said: \"We do have to bear in mind that the alternatives to what's happening now could be even more expensive \u2013 if you had a whole new team coming into RBS.\"</p> <p>But Osborne welcomed Hester's announcement. He said: \"This is a sensible and welcome decision that enables Stephen Hester to focus on the very important job he has got to do, namely to get back billions of pounds of taxpayers' money that was put into RBS.\"</p> <p>The moves are unlikely to oil the wheels of coalition relations. Tory ministers were annoyed when Vince Cable, the business secretary, responded to questions last week about the Hester bonus by saying it was above his pay grade.

      "bodyText": "It is probably a painful thought for Stephen Hester in his Swiss hideaway, but the fate of his \u00a3963,000 bonus was decided days ago, elsewhere, thousands of feet up in the Swiss Alps among the masters of world capitalism. As he flitted between a series of meetings in Davos on Friday, Ed Miliband developed a plan to call a parliamentary vote to force the UK Financial Investments to vote against the bonus. The plan, forged in a series of emails with the shadow business secretary, Chuka Umunna, and the chief whip, Rosie Winterton, was launched early on Sunday evening. Within hours, as ministers made clear in private they would find it difficult to support the bonus, Hester threw in the towel. Miliband believes Hester's move ranks with the decision last summer by News Corp to shelve its bid to take full control of BSkyB shortly before a Commons vote, called by Labour, to block the bid. The Labour leader also regards the Hester decision as a key moment in his campaign to shape what he is calling responsible capitalism. It is, Miliband hopes, a dreadful moment for David Cameron, who appears to be out of touch with public sentiment weeks after he outlined his vision to create a form of popular capitalism. In welcoming Hester's announcement, Miliband turned his fire on the prime minister. \"Stephen Hester has done the right thing,\" the Labour leader said. \"It is a shame that a feeble, out of touch David Cameron did not realise he should do the right thing and stand up for the interests of the British people. \"Labour was right to seek a parliamentary vote on this so that the people's voice could be heard. But the debate about fair executive pay and responsible capitalism is only just beginning. We need a government that will tax bankers' bonuses and bring responsibility to the boardroom.\" The announcement by Hester capped a difficult 72 hours for Cameron and George Osborne, who appear to have underestimated the strength of public feeling. Downing Street, which clocked weeks ago that Hester's bonus would have to be reduced, had confidently predicted that he would receive less than \u00a31m. Sources felt keeping the Hester bonus below the symbolically significant figure of \u00a31m would be tricky to sell but just about manageable on two grounds. These were that the RBS chief executive had increased business lending over the past year and had reduced the RBS balance sheet by \u00a30.5tn, thereby reducing the taxpayers' liability. But the timing of the bonus was unfortunate. Just a week before the announcement, Cameron outlined his ideas on how to create what he called popular capitalism. He said this fitted in a Tory tradition, dating back to Edmund Burke and Benjamin Disraeli, unlike Labour, which veered between promoting economic socialism or championing the super-rich. The prime minister's key phrase came back to haunt him last week, when his description of New Labour's approach to the rich appeared to describe today's state-controlled banks. Cameron said of New Labour's time in office: \"The City, which should have been a powerhouse of competition and creativity, became instead a byword for a sort of financial wizardry that left the taxpayer with all the risk, and a fortunate few with all of the rewards. So instead of popular capitalism we ended up with unpopular capitalism.\" Downing Street and the Treasury embarked on an aggressive operation when it became clear that the Hester bonus was deeply unpopular. On Thursday and Friday last week Downing Street said that ministers were bound by a contract negotiated by the last Labour government. Miliband's office moved quickly to quash that argument. Officials contacted Lord Myners, the Treasury minister in the last government who negotiated the Hester contract. Myners confirmed that the bonus was discretionary. \"There is nothing in the employment contract of Stephen Hester or any director of Royal Bank of Scotland which binds the company or its remuneration committee to pay a mandatory bonus,\" Myners said. \"All matters relating to bonuses are at the full discretion of the board of directors and the shareholders, including UKFI, who have elected them.\" Within hours the government embarked on a different tack. As Miliband was drawing up his plans in Davos, a short distance away in the Alpine resort Osborne hinted the government had been forced to act after a threat of resignations by the RBS board if the bonus was not approved. Government sources said Sir Philip Hampton, the RBS chairman who turned down a \u00a31.4m bonus, was particularly vociferous on behalf of Hester. Cameron came close to acknowledging that the government could have faced resignations on Saturday afternoon at Chequers. He said: \"We do have to bear in mind that the alternatives to what's happening now could be even more expensive \u2013 if you had a whole new team coming into RBS.\" But Osborne welcomed Hester's announcement. He said: \"This is a sensible and welcome decision that enables Stephen Hester to focus on the very important job he has got to do, namely to get back billions of pounds of taxpayers' money that was put into RBS.\" The moves are unlikely to oil the wheels of coalition relations. Tory ministers were annoyed when Vince Cable, the business secretary, responded to questions last week about the Hester bonus by saying it was above his pay grade. Tory sources pointed out that Lib Dems acknowledged the pressures facing the government: RBS has to be run by an effective leader. But Cable's team say that the handling of the Hester bonus highlighted a central contradiction raised by Miliband. The business secretary outlined plans to give shareholders a greater say over the remuneration of senior executives. Days after he made his announcement, Downing Street said that UKFI was declining to step in even though it represents RBS's largest shareholder \u2013 the UK taxpayer. Miliband believes he has placed the coalition in a perfect position. He believes the Lib Dems are seen as largely irrelevant because they appeared powerless to stop the bonus. As for Cameron, he appeared not to be bothered about the bonus until the headlines started to scream, according to the Labour leader. One senior Labour source said: \"Cameron's problem is not that he was born with a silver spoon in his mouth but that he has too much tin in his ears. On this issue he is out of touch verging on a different planet.\"",

London \u2013 usually seen as the gold standard of real estate \u2013 has lost some of its allure and is now just hanging on at the bottom of the top 10, according to a report by PricewaterhouseCoopers and the Urban Land Institute. The UK capital is regarded as \"too expensive for the economic outlook\" by many. But nowhere can be considered a \"must buy\" today, the report said, highlighting that Europe's economic crisis has left the property sector in limbo, with fast-diminishing access to bank loans and depressed rental demand. \"It's going to be a volatile market across the board,\" said John Forbes, real estate partner at PwC and author of the report. \"Investors realised there's no point in hanging around and waiting for an upturn because there wasn't one coming.\" He believes that regulatory changes forcing banks to sell off risky assets will create opportunities, in particular for equity investors less reliant on debt. Also, insurers and pension funds are beginning to step in and offer finance, although they will not be able to fully plug the gap left by banks unwilling to fund property investments. Istanbul held on to the top spot for new investment and development prospects for the second year running, thanks to its booming economy and youthful population. Munich, with one of the lowest unemployment rates in Germany, came second, rated for its stability, followed by Warsaw, which is rapidly becoming eastern Europe's financial hub, boosting the city's office sector. Berlin was Europe's most attractive market for residential investment, and Stockholm, Paris, Hamburg and Zurich were favourites for investors picking safe cities. Moscow made it into the top 10 for the first time, just ahead of London. London fell to 10th from second place, reflecting investors' feelings that the city is overpriced and will see very little appreciation of property values. Strong competition is another factor. \"Today London is the safest of havens that there is. But once the world is again stable and everyone pulls their money back home, that's when we will see how oversold it is,\" said one interviewee. Paris also slipped in the survey's rankings, but less than London because it is less reliant on banking and financial services. London's prime assets still attract a lot of demand from overseas, and for the first time more than half the office buildings in the City are foreign-owned, according to a study by Development Securities. South African billionaire Nathan Kirsh acquired Tower 42 and nearby buildings for \u00a3283m in December, while Asian palm oil billionaires Kuok Khoon Hong and Martua Sitorus bought Aviva's headquarters for \u00a3288m last June. Forbes said bargain hunters would turn to places like Dublin and Madrid. \"You don't make money by following the consensus.\" He said: \"Debt will be the main story of 2012. There is general pessimism regarding the availability of debt this year, and significantly, lenders are the gloomiest of all.\" Just 6% of lenders believe that debt will be as available as it was last year, with 52% believing it will be substantially less.",
