      "bodyText": "Mass unemployment in Greece, inflation at 50%, a devastating recession and Greeks heading for the borders \u2013 that's the apocalyptic scenario being painted by some economists in the increasingly likely event that Greece leaves the eurozone in coming months. Greece is small in economic terms: it contributes only 2.2% of eurozone GDP. But withdrawal from the single currency would unleash chaos in the country, and have potentially severe knock-on effects on other euro nations. US bank Citigroup now reckons there is a 75% chance that Greece will pull out of the single currency within the next 18 months. This would set a precedent, and the eurozone could quickly unravel if other vulnerable members like Spain and Italy were to follow suit. The fallout from a Greek exit would quickly wipe 20% off Greece's GDP, send inflation soaring to 40%-50%, and see Greece's debt-to-GDP ratio soaring over 200%, say analysts at French bank BNP Paribas. Such predictions are obviously estimates \u2013 the actual outcome would depend on how large a devaluation Greece would take if it reverted to the drachma. Dawn Holland at UK thinktank the National Institute of Economic and Social Research expects a 50% fall in the value of the currency. By comparison, the Argentinian peso lost 70% in value after the country's bankruptcy a decade ago. The practicalities of unpicking the eurozone are mind-boggling. Philip Shaw, chief economist at Investec, says: \"It was bad enough putting the euro together, but splitting it apart, or a little bit of it, would be more complex still. One issue would be what is denominated in euro and what in, say, drachma. Not easy.\" But it may be that, however challenging, that scenario will have to be faced. The warning signs are already clear: it is not difficult to envisage a sequence of events over the coming months that would leave Greece no choice but to break away. 1. ELECTORAL PARALYSIS Greece's election last week produced a messy result, with the two hitherto dominant mainstream parties suffering huge losses. Socialist leader Evangelos Venizelos, the former finance minister who negotiated Greece's second, \u20ac130bn bailout, tried to put together a government of national unity with his conservative counterpart, Antonis Samaras. However, the two parties jointly had 149 seats in parliament, two short of a majority, and could not have ruled alone. The political deadlock has triggered repeated warnings from European leaders that Greece could be thrown out of the euro if it does not stick to the spending cuts and economic reforms stipulated for the bailout \u2013 the only thing that that keeps Athens from a messy bankruptcy, which would mean a halt to paying government workers and pensioners. If Greece cannot form a government \u2013 and the majority of voters backed parties who are against abiding by the agreed bailout terms \u2013 political unrest will grow on the streets and its neighbours will get increasingly nervous. A second round of elections in mid-June could produce an even larger anti-austerity vote. 2. THE MONEY RUNS OUT So what happens if Greece remains without a government? Belgium recently set a modern-day record when it remained without a government for 541 days. Or what if a government is formed that does not adhere to the strict bailout conditions? The \"troika\" \u2013 the European Union, International Monetary Fund and European Central Bank \u2013 would probably turn off the taps and bailout money would stop flowing to the highly indebted country. At the same time, Greek banks would probably be cut off from the liquidity provided by the ECB. According to Jens Nordvig, global head of currency strategy at Nomura, this would mean that the euros held by Greek banks would become separated from the euros in the rest of the eurozone and over time would turn into a separate currency. He believes that there will be a \"Grexit\", as it has become called, and that it will come as a result of \"a political accident\". Christian Schultz, senior economist at Berenberg Bank, says last week's \u20ac4.2bn payment could be the last injection of bailout money and a run on its banks would become likely. \"If Greece continues to redeem bonds, and pay interest, it could run out of cash by July,\" he says. \"After that, the government would be unable to make full euro payments to pensioners and public employees. It may instead make these payments in promissory notes, which could form the nucleus of a new currency. Greece would face financial infarction: the country's banks would face a bank run.\" The last time this happened \u2013 in Argentina in 2001 \u2013 some people started sleeping outside cash machines in Buenos Aires so that they could withdraw as much money as possible once the machines has been refilled. The Argentinian government froze all accounts, banned individuals from taking out more than 250 pesos and halted withdrawals from dollar-based accounts. But the so-called corralito strategy didn't work. The courts supported tens of thousands of depositors and instructed the banks to repay them immediately in full. The government's policies sparked bloody protests that ended up toppling the government as Argentina plunged into a deep recession. 3. NEW CURRENCY, NEW BANKS To counteract a run on its banks after a debt default, a new Greek government would have to freeze bank accounts and introduce capital controls to prevent the country's citizens from moving money abroad. But analysts at Fathom Consulting believe Greeks would be \"likely to conclude that the space under their mattress would be safer than the vault of a Greek bank\", making a series of bank runs a strong possibility. The government would also have to pass a currency law and start up the banknote-printing machines. It is not inconceivable that Greece might already be quietly printing new money: when Slovakia broke away from Czechoslovakia in 1993, it emerged that it had started printing its own currency six months earlier. The money was stored in a warehouse in London and shipped to the newly created country once the breakup became official. To minimise the likely chaos that would ensue, the Greek government would probably choose to reintroduce the drachma over a weekend. Because the Greek banks are entirely reliant on the ECB for liquidity, they would become insolvent as soon as the money stopped flowing. The Greek government would have no choice but to create new banks, with substantial government involvement. Iceland was forced to do this during the financial crisis: it created three new banks from the ruins of the old bankrupt lenders. 4. GREEKS HEAD FOR THE BORDERS The Argentinian example shows that a Greek debt default and exit from the eurozone are likely to have dire economic and social consequences, at least in the short term. The country will become isolated. With lending drying up and accounts frozen, small businesses will go bust, exports plunge and the country will lurch deeper into recession. \"Consumption could drop by 30%,\" says Nordvig. \"There will be some pretty extreme effects.\" In Argentina's case, the largest ever sovereign bankruptcy \u2013 defaulting on $93bn of foreign debt \u2013 triggered a 60% fall in domestic consumption as household savings were wiped out and inflation rose. The depreciation of the new currency will make imported goods more expensive and drive up inflation. Mass unemployment is likely, as is an exodus of young skilled workers. If tens of thousands of Greeks headed to the borders, they might even be closed. Greek soldiers patrolling the roads and ports to keep their fellow citizens in? It is not impossible. The examples of Iceland and Argentina, where recovery has been impressive, offer some hope, though - although Argentina's default took place at a time when the global economy was on the up. 5. THE SHOCKWAVE SPREADS Holders of Greek government debt would undoubtedly suffer, as they risk having their assets redenominated into a rapidly falling new Greek currency \u2013 as would holders of Greek corporate debt. Returning to a Greek national currency would create all sorts of legal problems with business and government contracts. Greek companies forced still to make payments in euros will see costs and interest payments on euro loans double. Then, of course, there is the cost of bolstering the other vulnerable nations \u2013 such as Portugal and Spain \u2013 which the Institute of International Finance has recently estimated could run to \u20ac1 trillion. This burden would fall on the taxpayers of the remaining 16 eurozone states. Once the precedent of a country leaving the eurozone is established, stability and confidence in the rest of the currency bloc would be shot to pieces and in all likelihood send it back into recession. \"We have long held the view that, following the departure of just one member, a total breakup would be very much on the cards,\" says Fathom Consulting. Richard Ward, chief executive of the Lloyd's of London insurance market, on Friday warned that a eurozone breakup could lead to a \"potentially terrible recession for the globe\". And UBS says: \"The costs of breakup go way beyond the economic. To quote Shakespeare, in the event of a fragmentation of the euro, economists will have little to do but 'cry havoc, and let slip the dogs of war.'\"",

At the same time, Greek banks would probably be cut off from the liquidity provided by the ECB.</p> <p>According to Jens Nordvig, global head of currency strategy at Nomura, this would mean that the euros held by Greek banks would become separated from the euros in the rest of the eurozone and over time would turn into a separate currency.</p> <p>He believes that there will be a \"Grexit\", as it has become called, and that it will come as a result of \"a political accident\".</p> <p>Christian Schultz, senior economist at Berenberg Bank, says last week's \u20ac4.2bn payment could be the last injection of bailout money and a run on its banks would become likely.</p> <p>\"If Greece continues to redeem bonds, and pay interest, it could run out of cash by July,\" he says. \"After that, the government would be unable to make full euro payments to pensioners and public employees. It may instead make these payments in promissory notes, which could form the nucleus of a new currency. Greece would face financial infarction: the country's banks would face a bank run.\"</p> <p>The last time this happened \u2013 in Argentina in 2001 \u2013 some people started sleeping outside cash machines in Buenos Aires so that they could withdraw as much money as possible once the machines has been refilled.</p> <p>The Argentinian government froze all accounts, banned individuals from taking out more than 250 pesos and halted withdrawals from dollar-based accounts. But the so-called <em>corralito</em> strategy didn't work. The courts supported tens of thousands of depositors and instructed the banks to repay them immediately in full. The government's policies sparked bloody protests that ended up toppling the government as Argentina plunged into a deep recession.</p> <h2><strong>3. NEW CURRENCY, NEW BANKS</strong></h2> <p>To counteract a run on its banks after a debt default, a new Greek government would have to freeze bank accounts and introduce capital controls to prevent the country's citizens from moving money abroad. But analysts at Fathom Consulting believe Greeks would be \"likely to conclude that the space under their mattress would be safer than the vault of a Greek bank\", making a series of bank runs a strong possibility.</p> <p>The government would also have to pass a currency law and start up the banknote-printing machines. It is not inconceivable that Greece might already be quietly printing new money: when Slovakia broke away from Czechoslovakia in 1993, it emerged that it had started printing its own currency six months earlier. The money was stored in a warehouse in London and shipped to the newly created country once the breakup became official. To minimise the likely chaos that would ensue, the Greek government would probably choose to reintroduce the drachma over a weekend.</p> <p>Because the Greek banks are entirely reliant on the ECB for liquidity, they would become insolvent as soon as the money stopped flowing. The Greek government would have no choice but to create new banks, with substantial government involvement. Iceland was forced to do this during the financial crisis: it created three new banks from the ruins of the old bankrupt lenders.</p> <h2><strong>4. GREEKS HEAD FOR THE BORDERS</strong></h2> <p>The Argentinian example shows that a Greek debt default and exit from the eurozone are likely to have dire economic and social consequences, at least in the short term. The country will become isolated. With lending drying up and accounts frozen, small businesses will go bust, exports plunge and the country will lurch deeper into recession. \"Consumption could drop by 30%,\" says Nordvig. \"There will be some pretty extreme&#xa0;effects.\"</p> <p>In Argentina's case, the largest ever sovereign bankruptcy \u2013 defaulting on $93bn of foreign debt \u2013 triggered a 60% fall in domestic consumption as household savings were wiped out and inflation rose.</p> <p>The depreciation of the new currency will make imported goods more expensive and drive up inflation. Mass unemployment is likely, as is an exodus of young skilled workers. If tens of thousands of Greeks headed to the borders, they might even be closed. Greek soldiers patrolling the roads and ports to keep their fellow citizens in? It is not impossible.</p> <p>The examples of Iceland and Argentina, where recovery has been impressive, offer some hope, though - although Argentina's default took place at a time when the global economy was on the up.</p> <h2><strong>5. THE SHOCKWAVE SPREADS</strong></h2> <p>Holders of Greek government debt would undoubtedly suffer, as they risk having their assets redenominated into a rapidly falling new Greek currency \u2013 as would holders of Greek corporate debt. Returning to a Greek national currency would create all sorts of legal problems with business and government contracts. Greek companies forced still to make payments in euros will see costs and interest payments on euro loans double. Then, of course, there is the cost of bolstering the other vulnerable nations \u2013 such as Portugal and Spain \u2013 which the Institute of International Finance has recently estimated could run to \u20ac1 trillion. This burden would fall on the taxpayers of the remaining 16 eurozone states.</p> <p>Once the precedent of a country leaving the eurozone is established, stability and confidence in the rest of the currency bloc would be shot to pieces and in all likelihood send it back into recession. \"We have long held the view that, following the departure of just one member, a total breakup would be very much on the cards,\" says Fathom Consulting.</p> <p>Richard Ward, chief executive of the Lloyd's of London insurance market, on Friday warned that a eurozone breakup could lead to a \"potentially terrible recession for the globe\".</p> <p>And UBS says: \"The costs of breakup go way beyond the economic. To quote Shakespeare, in the event of a fragmentation of the euro, economists will have little to do but 'cry havoc, and let slip the dogs of war.'\"</p>",

Opinion polls show that 70% of Greeks want to remain part of the eurozone. Only the parties of the extreme left and right want it to exit.

      "bodyText": "Unemployment in Greece stands at a record 21.7%. More than one in two young people aged between 18 and 24 is out of work. The economy will be 20% smaller at the end of 2012 than it was five years ago and shows little sign of pulling out of its tailspin. So when the cry goes up that departure from the eurozone would be a calamity for Greece, the obvious riposte is: how much worse can it get? Greeks fully understand that life outside the single currency would be tough. They know that defaulting on debts and currency devaluation will have costs, including a likely plunge in output, a fresh squeeze on living standards and the risk of much higher inflation. But the alternative \u2013 year after year of economic depression as Greece tries to make itself more competitive \u2013 does not sound like a bed of roses either. Ideally, Greece would like to stay in the euro without the current level of austerity, but if these objectives prove incompatible it will eventually have to choose between the two. The argument for exit rests on four pillars: it makes economic sense, the pain would be over more quickly, the costs are exaggerated, and it would be better for Europe. Greece is currently labouring under a bastardised form of the sort of structural adjustment programme the International Monetary Fund imposes on developing countries. The difference is that the classic IMF remedy is devaluation plus domestic austerity, to ensure gains from a cheaper currency are not frittered away through higher inflation. Greece (and the other bailed-out eurozone countries) are expected to do it all through an internal devaluation \u2013 cuts in wages and public spending designed to reduce costs and boost competitiveness. This, though, takes a lot longer and can be self-defeating if the domestic economy contracts more rapidly than exports expand. If this happens, as it has in Greece, the debt problem gets worse. That's why critics of the current bailout argue that while Greece would suffer severe transitional costs from a go-it-alone strategy, the choice is between a deep V-shaped recession and a decade or more of permanent depression. Argentina provides the template for a country that defied the doomsters and made a go of life after devaluation and default. In the 1990s, Argentina's position was broadly comparable to that of Greece after monetary union. It had pegged the peso to the dollar, a policy that in the first half of the decade led to much lower inflation, but in the second half of the 1990s resulted in much lower growth. By the end of the 1990s, the currency peg came under strain, and like Greece, Argentina tried and failed to muddle its way through with a mixture of austerity, IMF bailouts and debt rescheduling. When the country went its own way in early 2002, there were predictions of economic Armageddon, but from 2003-2007 growth averaged 9% a year. Comparisons between Greece and Argentina are not precise, because Argentina is a big commodity producer and devalued when the global economy was booming. Greece, by contrast, is part of a recession-mired eurozone, and the turbulence caused by its exit from the single currency might make matters worse. That, though, is debatable, given that Europe has staggered from crisis to crisis since the full extent of Greece's debt problem became apparent two and a half years ago. Provided departure was planned and smooth rather than disruptive and contagious (a very big proviso, admittedly), the rest of the eurozone might be able at last to move on.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Paris Bar, a popular haunt for west Berlin intellectuals of a certain age, was humming with conversation and the clink of glasses and cutlery last week as actors, theatregoers, artists and journalists sipped wine or tucked into steak frites in this Gallic enclave in the German capital. Beneath a red neon sign, Philippe and Paula pulled on cigarettes and discussed their respective governments' different approaches to the euro crisis. \"You could say we are like chalk and cheese,\" said Paula, a 39-year-old German writer. \"But that sounds quite boring. So let's say more like bratwurst and Chateau Margaux.\" Philippe, 42, a scriptwriter from Paris (both of them preferred not to give their family names), nodded in agreement and chuckled. \"Going back to the chalk and cheese metaphor: the difference between us is that the Germans would be happy to eat chalk if they were told it would solve the economic crisis, while the French would not be prepared to give up their cheese.\" Food metaphors abound these days before the hugely significant Franco-German summit on Tuesday when France's newly elected president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, will visit Germany's Angela Merkel only hours after he takes office. They have never met before. Although described by officials on both sides as primarily a meet-and- greet occasion rather than a political exchange, the evening \u2013 during which the two will enjoy a working supper in Berlin's cuboid chancellory (menu yet to be revealed) \u2013 will be dominated by Europe's increasingly controversial austerity drive. Most have predicted a tense meeting between the German conservative and the French socialist. Merkel has unerringly championed austerity, while Hollande told a cheering crowd on the night of his election that austerity \"need not be Europe's fate\". It is a critical moment in European politics. The main driving forces of the eurozone are at loggerheads. Hollande does not want to sign up to Merkel's fiscal pact, which places strict limits on sovereign debt and gives the European court of justice a role in enforcing economic discipline. Merkel has insisted she will not back down. Meanwhile, voters in Greece have rejected pro-austerity parties at the polls, leaving the country on the brink of exiting the eurozone unless the electorate can be persuaded to change its mind. And the spectre of economic collapse in Spain is looming. The French mood is bullish. Beno\u00eet Hamon, spokesperson for the Socialist party, said: \"Angela Merkel is sticking to her position, but she cannot override the will of the French people. If nothing budges, the treaty won't be submitted for ratification in France.\" Pierre Moscovici, campaign director for Hollande and the man charged with making sure the presidential handover runs smoothly, said he was confident there would be a compromise on growth. \"They will speak. There has to be a proper discussion between the two heads of state. Fran\u00e7ois Hollande's aim is clear and hasn't changed; it is to reorientate the European construction in a way that is more favourable for growth.\" Moscovici, a former minister of European affairs, added: 'The small experience I have of these things \u2026 is that you will find a compromise. I'm optimistic that things will go well. Hollande is not alone in arguing the revisionist case. From the United States government to the International Monetary Fund and increasing numbers of European governments, pressure is growing on Germany to relax its approach to austerity, which is increasingly being seen as hindering economic recovery. Merkel's old political ally, Nicolas Sarkozy, is out of office. The recent fall of the Dutch government, amid disagreement over strict austerity measures, has left Merkel still more isolated in her insistence that belt-tightening is the only plausible route to economic recovery. Across the continent, a growing number of voices now suggest that the problem is not just southern European profligacy, but also German parsimony. This is the nation which has some of the highest labour costs in the world, but where wages have been kept low compared to the rest of western Europe; where wage discipline among workers and employers has come to be seen as a patriotic act. Add in a huge trade surplus and Germany's competitive advantage over its European neighbours is enormous. The resulting imbalance in the eurozone is helping no one. Merkel remains unmoved, insisting last week, despite the criticisms, that the purse strings cannot be loosened. Her matter-of-fact reaction to the crisis led the S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung newspaper to observe that \"rather than behaving as if she had a European crisis to deal with \u2026 it was as if she was bending over the assembly instructions for an Ikea cupboard\". \"We're talking here about the future of Europe,\" Merkel said later, with rather more of a flourish. \"And because of this the fiscal pact is simply not up for discussion.\" While she is in favour of boosting growth, spending to stimulate growth is no option, she says, as it \"would send us back to square one\". Josef Joffe, publisher of the weekly Die Zeit, complained last week that she was being unfairly treated and that anti-Merkel sentiment had reached a peak after the French and Greek elections. \"She's completely on her own now, seen to be stopping Europe from getting back to good health with her stinginess and teutonic arrogance,\" he said. \"Which is a fiction on two fronts. Firstly, decades of waste are to blame for Europe's [bankrupt state]. Secondly, it diverts attention from the real illness \u2026 Europe's [lack of] competitiveness.\" Merkel has enjoyed very high personal popularity ratings during the almost seven years she has been in power, and her steadfast handling of the euro crisis has served only to solidify her support at home. According to a recent poll, 61% of Germans said Merkel should stick to her stringent pro-austerity stance. But recent events in France and Greece have undoubtedly left the chancellor vulnerable. Until now, Germany's opposition has been reluctant to challenge Merkel's insistence on budgetary discipline. Not any more. \"We are seeing the result of this policy in Greece where the radical right and enemies of Europe are entering parliament,\" Sigmar Gabriel, head of the Social Democrats (SPD), said in an interview. \"Almost all economists have long shared the criticism of Merkel's unimaginative imposition of austerity.\" Another flank opens up this weekend with a key election in Germany's most populous state \u2013 and political bellwether \u2013 North Rhine-Westphalia. With next year's general election looming on the horizon, this political test will provide a crucial guide to Merkel's political future. North Rhine-Westphalia is indebted to the tune of \u20ac230bn (\u00a3185bn) and Merkel's Christian Democratic Union (CDU) has been vigorously campaigning on the pro-austerity ticket. \"Angela Merkel cannot seem to be credible and strong if policies that cause debt to rise are being pursued indecently in Germany's most populous state,\" said Norbert R\u00f6ttgen, the conservatives' leading candidate. At election rallies in the state, Merkel has often repeated the phrase that has earned her the nickname \"the Swabian housewife\" \u2013 the model German citizen famed for her thriftiness \u2013 giving outsiders an interesting window into the German soul. \"At the end of the day it's quite simple,\" she said at one rally. \"Do not spend more than you earn.\" The statement reflects the pragmatism that has shaped 57-year-old Merkel's political and personal life. This is the woman who when she left her first husband (admittedly during the days of the economically straitened East German regime) took the washing machine with her. But if opinion polls are anything to go by, Germans in North Rhine-Westphalia at least are not buying into the austerity argument. The Christian Democrats are trailing their closest rivals, the Social Democrats by several percentage points. Commentators and analysts are now talking of a rethink or even a backlash taking place, which is likely to become even more focused when Hollande arrives in town. \"The German discussion is moving a notch closer to the international debate on whether austerity has become self-defeating because it is implemented in an overly-brutal way,\" according to Sebastian Dullien of the European Council on Foreign Relations. There are other signs that Germany is prepared to water down its hardline stance, such as the announcement las week by the Bundesbank that it will in future tolerate higher inflation in an attempt to help rebalance economies in the eurozone. Although that instantly triggered fears in the popular press of a return to the hyperinflation that haunted Germany in the 1920s, Carsten Brzeski, an economist with the Dutch bank ING, welcomed the decision, saying it amounted to an admission by Germany that it \"must take responsibility for finding a new equilibrium in the eurozone\". Finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble also signalled a willingness to accept higher wage increases in the hope that it might boost Germans' readiness to spend and bring it on to a more equal footing with other European nations. \"So far,\" said Dullien, \"Germany has been the veto player preventing any policy change. If Germany's economic elite is now changing course, this might hint that there is a room for compromise between Angela Merkel and Fran\u00e7ois Hollande towards policies which might really help to overcome the crisis.\" So while Tuesday's meeting might not be a love-in, neither does it have to be a bust up; rather perhaps, as the financial analyst suggested, it'll be a hard-to-digest black-bread marmalade sandwich.",

      "body": "<p>The Paris Bar, a popular haunt for west Berlin intellectuals of a certain age, was humming with conversation and the clink of glasses and cutlery last week as actors, theatregoers, artists and journalists sipped wine or tucked into <em>steak frites</em> in this Gallic enclave in the German capital.</p> <p>Beneath a red neon sign, Philippe and Paula pulled on cigarettes and discussed their respective governments' different approaches to the euro crisis. \"You could say we are like chalk and cheese,\" said Paula, a 39-year-old German writer. \"But that sounds quite boring. So let's say more like bratwurst and Chateau Margaux.\"</p> <p>Philippe, 42, a scriptwriter from Paris (both of them preferred not to give their family names), nodded in agreement and chuckled. \"Going back to the chalk and cheese metaphor: the difference between us is that the Germans would be happy to eat chalk if they were told it would solve the economic crisis, while the French would not be prepared to give up their cheese.\"</p> <p>Food metaphors abound these days before the hugely significant Franco-German summit on Tuesday when France's newly elected president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, will visit Germany's Angela Merkel only hours after he takes office. They have never met before.</p> <p>Although described by officials on both sides as primarily a meet-and- greet occasion rather than a political exchange, the evening \u2013 during which the two will enjoy a working supper in Berlin's cuboid chancellory (menu yet to be revealed) \u2013 will be dominated by Europe's increasingly controversial austerity drive.</p> <p>Most have predicted a tense meeting between the German conservative and the French socialist. Merkel has unerringly championed austerity, while Hollande told a cheering crowd on the night of his election that austerity \"need not be Europe's fate\".</p> <p>It is a critical moment in European politics. The main driving forces of the eurozone are at loggerheads. Hollande does not want to sign up to Merkel's fiscal pact, which places strict limits on sovereign debt and gives the European court of justice a role in enforcing economic discipline. Merkel has insisted she will not back down. Meanwhile, voters in Greece have rejected pro-austerity parties at the polls, leaving the country on the brink of exiting the eurozone unless the electorate can be persuaded to change its mind. And the spectre of economic collapse in Spain is looming.</p> <p>The French mood is bullish. Beno\u00eet Hamon, spokesperson for the Socialist party, said: \"Angela Merkel is sticking to her position, but she cannot override the will of the French people. If nothing budges, the treaty won't be submitted for ratification in France.\"</p> <p>Pierre Moscovici, campaign director for Hollande and the man charged with making sure the presidential handover runs smoothly, said he was confident there would be a compromise on growth. \"They will speak. There has to be a proper discussion between the two heads of state. Fran\u00e7ois Hollande's aim is clear and hasn't changed; it is to reorientate the European construction in a way that is more favourable for growth.\"</p> <p>Moscovici, a former minister of European affairs, added: 'The small experience I have of these things \u2026 is that you will find a compromise. I'm optimistic that things will go well.</p> <p>Hollande is not alone in arguing the revisionist case. From the United States government to the International Monetary Fund and increasing numbers of European governments, pressure is growing on Germany to relax its approach to austerity, which is increasingly being seen as hindering economic recovery.</p> <p>Merkel's old political ally, Nicolas Sarkozy, is out of office. The recent fall of the Dutch government, amid disagreement over strict austerity measures, has left Merkel still more isolated in her insistence that belt-tightening is the only plausible route to economic recovery.</p> <p>Across the continent, a growing number of voices now suggest that the problem is not just southern European profligacy, but also German parsimony.</p> <p>This is the nation which has some of the highest labour costs in the world, but where wages have been kept low compared to the rest of western Europe; where wage discipline among workers and employers has come to be seen as a patriotic act. Add in a huge trade surplus and Germany's competitive advantage over its European neighbours is enormous. The resulting imbalance in the eurozone is helping no one.</p> <p>Merkel remains unmoved, insisting last week, despite the criticisms, that the purse strings cannot be loosened. Her matter-of-fact reaction to the crisis led the <em>S\u00fcddeutsche</em> <em>Zeitung</em> newspaper to observe that \"rather than behaving as if she had a European crisis to deal with \u2026 it was as if she was bending over the assembly instructions for an Ikea cupboard\".</p> <p>\"We're talking here about the future of Europe,\" Merkel said later, with rather more of a flourish. \"And because of this the fiscal pact is simply not up for discussion.\" While she is in favour of boosting growth, spending to stimulate growth is no option, she says, as it \"would send us back to square one\".</p> <p>Josef Joffe, publisher of the weekly <em>Die Zeit</em>, complained last week that she was being unfairly treated and that anti-Merkel sentiment had reached a peak after the French and Greek elections.</p> <p>\"She's completely on her own now, seen to be stopping Europe from getting back to good health with her stinginess and teutonic arrogance,\" he said. \"Which is a fiction on two fronts. Firstly, decades of waste are to blame for Europe's [bankrupt state]. Secondly, it diverts attention from the real illness \u2026 Europe's [lack of] competitiveness.\"</p> <p>Merkel has enjoyed very high personal popularity ratings during the almost seven years she has been in power, and her steadfast handling of the euro crisis has served only to solidify her support at home.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Reaction to the shareholder revolt over Bob Diamond's \u00a317.7m payout has been split into two main camps. The proportion of shareholders voting against Diamond's bonus was either a whopping 26%, heralding a new era of shareholder activism \u2013 or it was a derisory 26%, demonstrating the folly of relying on shareholders to rein in excessive pay. This reflects more general attitudes to the so-called \"shareholder spring\": depending on your point of view, it's either a flash in the pan or a sign of the times. But there's a third response to the events of the past fortnight, and it starts with asking why shareholders have chosen this year to rediscover their spines. Over the past decade, while executive pay has quadrupled, average levels of shareholder dissent have been stuck at about 9%, with outright defeat remaining a freak event. Even in 2009, when the financial crisis saw the value of FTSE 100 companies nosedive, only two remuneration reports were voted down. Barely a month into this year's AGM season, Aviva and Pendragon have already suffered the same fate. So what's changed? The obvious answer is that shareholders have found themselves in the spotlight. As public anger about high pay refuses to abate, and government places the responsibility for doing something about it firmly on investors' shoulders, voting decisions are under scrutiny like never before. Perhaps the real lesson of the shareholder spring is that institutional investors behave like quantum particles: differently when observed. Many on the left point to the dominance of institutional investors in the City as a reason to be sceptical of shareholder power. True, the proportion of stock owned by individuals has plummeted over the last 40 years, but these anonymous institutions are, among others, the pension funds and insurance companies who look after our retirement savings. In other words, the owners of corporate Britain are no longer a few rich individuals: they include anyone with pension savings, or around 11 million of us. This is our money. It is not immediately obvious, then, why today's big shareholders should have less interest in reining in corporate excess than the wealthy individual owners of yesteryear. Indeed, the rise of pension funds as a major economic force was accompanied by optimistic predictions about \"citizen investors\" reshaping the capital markets in the public interest. But an acute democratic deficit separates this theory from the reality. We are, for the most part, totally disconnected from decisions about our money. Pension funds delegate key decisions to City fund managers, who are themselves part of the corporate elite, and for whom FTSE 100 companies mean big business. It's little surprise that these firms have been less than enthusiastic about challenging high pay. The latent potential of mass ownership has gone unrealised because power is still being hoarded in the City. But this is not inevitable, and change is in the air. In the wake of the Barclays vote, responsible investment charity FairPensions has launched \"Your Say on Pay\". This online action tool will email your pension fund or Isa provider and tell them that you want them to vote against excessive pay. It will also ask them to let you know what they do about it. Of course, they don't have to respond. Legally speaking, your rights to information about what goes on with your money are shockingly minimal. But asserting those rights is the first step to greater accountability. It's all too rare for funds to hear from the savers they represent. Those who exercise power on our behalf need to be reminded that it's not their money. And the more of us speak up, the harder it becomes to ignore us. None of this is to say that government has no role in ensuring shareholders do their job properly. The legal framework must support and nurture a civil economy. Institutional investors should be legally required to publish their voting records so that ordinary savers can hold them to account. The government must also make it clear that investors' legal duty to us does not begin and end with maximising the next quarter's profits. Neither is this a ringing endorsement of shareholder supremacy. Shareholder capitalism has much to prove. But we are part of the system whether we like it or not. The choice lies between stepping aside and leaving the field to vested interests, and stepping in to hold our agents accountable. Those on the left who dismiss shareholder power as a dead duck are letting the City off the hook. They're also missing an opportunity. By asserting our collective agency as economic citizens, we can begin the process of democratising finance and building an economy that benefits society as a whole. Whether the shareholder spring proves to be a one-season wonder or something more permanent may yet be up to us.",

      "body": "<p>Reaction to the shareholder revolt over <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2012/apr/27/barclays-agm-serious-blow\" title=\"\">Bob Diamond's \u00a317.7m payout</a> has been split into two main camps. The proportion of shareholders voting against Diamond's bonus was either a whopping 26%, heralding a new era of shareholder activism \u2013 or it was a derisory 26%, demonstrating the folly of relying on shareholders to rein in excessive pay. This reflects more general attitudes to the so-called \"shareholder spring\": depending on your point of view, it's either a flash in the pan or a sign of the times.</p> <p>But there's a third response to the events of the past fortnight, and it starts with asking why shareholders have chosen this year to rediscover their spines. Over the past decade, while executive pay has quadrupled, average levels of shareholder dissent have been stuck at about 9%, with outright defeat remaining a freak event. Even in 2009, when the financial crisis saw the value of FTSE&#xa0;100 companies nosedive, only two remuneration reports were voted down. Barely a month into this year's AGM season, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/may/03/aviva-shareholder-rebellion-executive-pay\" title=\"\">Aviva</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/may/10/shareholder-spring-continues-pendragon\" title=\"\">Pendragon</a> have already suffered the same fate. So what's changed?</p> <p>The obvious answer is that shareholders have found themselves in the spotlight. As public anger about high pay refuses to abate, and government places the responsibility for doing something about it firmly on investors' shoulders, voting decisions are under scrutiny like never before. Perhaps the real lesson of the shareholder spring is that institutional investors behave like quantum particles: differently when observed.</p> <p>Many on the left point to the dominance of institutional investors in the City as a reason to be sceptical of shareholder power. True, the proportion of stock owned by individuals has plummeted over the last 40 years, but these anonymous institutions are, among others, the pension funds and insurance companies who look after our retirement savings. In other words, the owners of corporate Britain are no longer a few rich individuals: they include anyone with pension savings, or around 11 million of us. This is our&#xa0;money.</p> <p>It is not immediately obvious, then, why today's big shareholders should have less interest in reining in corporate excess than the wealthy individual owners of yesteryear. Indeed, the rise of pension funds as a major economic force was accompanied by optimistic predictions about \"citizen investors\" reshaping the capital markets in the public interest.
