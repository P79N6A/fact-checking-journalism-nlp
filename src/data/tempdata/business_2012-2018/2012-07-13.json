    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Funding for Lending, the latest George Osborne-backed wheeze for kick-starting the economy, details of which were announced on Friday, is a clear sign of the rising panic at the Treasury and the Bank of England about Britain's double-dip. City analysts pointed out that the structure of the plan looked strikingly similar to the Special Liquidity Scheme that the government and the Bank used to pump cheap funding into battered banks at the height of the financial crisis \u2013 and which at the time was seen as a last-ditch emergency measure. This latest programme also follows Project Merlin, a gentlemen's agreement that imposed lending targets on the banks and was almost universally regarded as an abject failure; and Osborne's national loan guarantee scheme, which only got under way in March, and was meant to provide cheaper loans for firms, exactly the aim of the new FLS, as it will be known. Amid this blizzard of cross-cutting plans and schemes, business lending has continued to plunge: the Bank of England's figures show that the stock of bank loans to the corporate sector peaked in August 2008 at \u00a3517bn, and has since fallen by \u00a395bn, or 18%. Vince Cable, the business secretary, says that means the banks, in addition to their many other sins, are \"throttling the recovery\". From that perspective, and especially with the eurozone crisis still far from over, ensuring a cheap line of funding for banks \u2013 which will be able to swap chunks of their loan portfolio for safe, liquid Treasury bills \u2013 looks like a sensible insurance measure. And some firms that have been dissuaded from borrowing by the price of a loan may find they can now borrow more affordably. But there are two major risks. The first is that banks will find a way of gaming the system \u2013 pocketing the cheap funding, and failing to pass on the benefits to their customers. Bank of England officials appear to have worked hard in designing the scheme to give banks every incentive to boost lending \u2013 by charging them a higher interest rate if their loan book shrinks, for example. But banks have an impressive record for finding a loophole. Secondly, there's the much debated question of whether it's really a lack of affordable loans that's \"throttling\" the recovery; or the fact that shell-shocked firms and families whose balance sheets were shot full of holes by the recession don't want to take on any more borrowing. If the FLS fails to halt the relentless slide in business lending, it will be painfully clear that there is far more wrong with the British economy than a few stingy banks.",

Since the financial crash he has been hauled in front of the Treasury select committee three times and refused to apologise for Moody's role in the crisis.</p> <p>The Lords have had a pop at him, as have the Europeans. And they all have the same questions: were the rating agencies to blame? Don't they make matters worse when they downgrade a country struggling to pay its debts?</p> <p>Drevon talks slowly as if explaining the whole, complicated mess to a five-year-old. Moody's is just an observer, putting its opinions of the market out into the unknown.

      "bodyText": "Frederic Drevon, head of Europe for the rating agency Moody's, is very good at answering questions, but then he's had plenty of practice. Since the financial crash he has been hauled in front of the Treasury select committee three times and refused to apologise for Moody's role in the crisis. The Lords have had a pop at him, as have the Europeans. And they all have the same questions: were the rating agencies to blame? Don't they make matters worse when they downgrade a country struggling to pay its debts? Drevon talks slowly as if explaining the whole, complicated mess to a five-year-old. Moody's is just an observer, putting its opinions of the market out into the unknown. It can't possibly take responsibility for what investors do based on those opinions. But to what extent do the rating agencies consider the consequences of their actions? On Friday Moody's downgraded Italy, and traders fear that a Spanish downgrade is not far off.

      "body": "<p>Mining shares led the market higher, as the latest data from China showed the country's economy was still growing, albeit more slowly than previously.</p> <p>China of course is a major consumer of commodities, and the figures eased fears that mining companies' revenues could come under pressure. So <strong>Rio Tinto</strong> rose 94p to \u00a330.20, <strong>Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation</strong> climbed 15.2p to 408.8p and <strong>BHP Billiton</strong> was 54.5p better at 1805.5p.</p> <p><strong>Kazakhmys</strong> climbed 42.5p to 744p on renewed talk that it could swap its 26% in ENRC for Glencore's 51% stake in zinc and gold group Kazzinc. Analyst Paul Cliff at ING said any deal would have to include a $500m payment from Glencore to make up for the difference in valuation between the two businesses. He said a deal would benefit Kazakhmys, but it was not clear whether Glencore would want to sell the business. Cliff said:</p> <blockquote> Any potential deal would likely generate operational and capital expenditure synergies, as well as an improved growth profile for Kazakhmys. <br> An asset swap is more likely than a cash sale of Kazakhmys' ENRC stake: a cash exit appears unlikely following ENRC's poor share price performance, in our view. Kazakhmys has little need for additional cash as its balance sheet is strong and its key growth projects enjoy low-cost Chinese funding. We believe returning cash proceeds from any potential sale of ENRC to shareholders could also result in Kazakhmys being relegated from the FTSE 100 index. We think management would rather swap Kazakhmys' minority stake in ENRC for a controlling stake in additional base metals assets in central Asia.  While we feel comfortable that Kazzinc would be a good strategic fit for Kazakhmys, Glencore might not, of course, be a seller. Glencore has already agreed with Verny to increase its ownership in Kazzinc from 50.7% to 93% for $3.2bn. However, we note that the average equity value of mid-tier zinc producers has almost halved since Glencore's IPO, while the intended IPO of Kazzinc's gold assets is no longer likely to generate additional value, in our view.  Our [estimated value] for Kazzinc (100% basis) is $4.3bn, valuing Glencore's 50.7% stake at $2.2bn. Our [valuation of Kazakhmys' ENRC stake is] $2.65bn.  We think the potential for a value-accretive exit from ENRC remains too speculative at this stage, and we maintain our sell recommendation for Kazakhmys. We continue to believe the market is underestimating Kazakhmys' cost-inflation problem and consensus earnings per share is too high (albeit falling rapidly). Our 630p target price represents a 15% discount to our net present value estimate for the company. </blockquote> <p><strong>Anglo American</strong> added 35p to \u00a320.45 despite Liberum Capital moving its recommendation from buy to hold ahead of the company's half year figures on 27 July. Analyst Dominic Okane said:</p> <blockquote> We expect pre-reporting by key divisions [Amplats, Kumba, De Beers] will deliver disappointment ahead of the plc's results, triggering another cut to consensus estimates. Anglo has performed in line with the pack year to date but has had the worst earnings momentum alongside bid target Xstrata. <br> Long term Anglo holders have held out in hope of an Amplats de-merger or a bid materialising. Both now look remote and a premium-justifying bid by Glencore Xstrata is simply wide of the mark. </blockquote> <p>Elsewhere in the sector <strong>Polymetal</strong> recovered 56p to 877p after a fall earlier in the week on news it had been ordered to pay $27m in taxes and fines relating to the pricing of silver contracts.</p> <p>Overall the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> finished 57.88 points higher at 5666.13, as investors shrugged off Moody's downgrade of Italy and further details of Spain's budget cuts. Over the week the leading index was virtually unchanged, amid protests in Europe over austerity and disappointment that the US Federal Reserve appeared reluctant to take more aggressive measures to boost the world's largest economy. The US reporting season began with many companies showing the scars of the global downturn.</p> <p>Among the risers, <strong>Burberry</strong> recovered 71p to \u00a312.29 following Thursday's falls on signs of a trading slowdown.</p> <p><strong>ITV</strong> added 2.7p to 74.95p, helped by news that US cable group Comcast had sold its 15.8% stake in History Channel owner A&amp;E Television Networks to Disney and Hearst Corporation for a better than expected $3.02bn. There was also a spot of Friday afternoon bid speculation.</p> <p><strong>BT</strong> rose 7.6p to 222.3p after a positive note on the telecoms sector from Credit Suisse. It said:</p> <blockquote> We are now more positive on the European telco sector, having increased our house overweight stance versus the market. We continue to see scope for BT to beat consensus on cost cutting. Business spend is likely to be weak again, but expectations are lower now. </blockquote> <p><strong>Aggreko</strong> added 17p to \u00a319.36. The temporary power supply company was hit on Thursday by a warning on sales from US group Cummins, one of its key suppliers. Cummins said US demand for power generation equipment had weakened, and it saw no improvement in sales from Brazil, China and India. But Caroline de La Soujeole at Seymour Pierce said:</p> <blockquote> Although we acknowledge that Aggreko is a significant customer of Cummins power generation segment (at around20% according to some market estimates), we do not believe Cummins downgrade is a precursor of bad news from Aggreko. One of Aggreko's key strength is its scale which enables it to respond quickly to any changes in demand. In its pre-close trading update, which was less than a month ago, Aggreko raised its capital expenditure guidance by \u00a350m to \u00a3415m. We remain comfortable with our positive stance on the company. Forecasts remain unchanged. The recent weakness in the share price represents a buying opportunity in our view with the shares trading on a prospective PE of 18 times. <br> </blockquote> <p>But continuing criticism of <strong>G4S</strong> over its poor performance in providing security for the London Olympics saw its shares fall 4.3p to 278.7p.</p> <p><strong>Experian</strong> lost 19p to 932p despite the credit information company announcing a 14% rise in quarterly revenue, driven by a strong performance in north America. Caroline de La Soujeole at Seymour Pierce said:</p> <blockquote> Overall this is a very good performance from Experian.

      "body": "<p>A scheme to boost lending to first time buyers and small companies was unveiled today by the Bank of England in a move that ministers hope will inject fresh funds into the ailing UK economy.</p> <p>The \"funding for lending\" scheme, which will take effect next month, was welcomed by the chancellor George Osborne who said the launch of the \u00a380bn emergency facility showed Britain was \"not powerless to act\" in the face of the eurozone crisis.</p> <p>The Bank of England said cheap loans to banks and building societies by the central bank would offset the effects of higher costs faced by financial institutions in wholesale money markets.</p> <p>Business groups said they hoped the scheme would prove more effective than Project Merlin, which the coalition claimed would force banks to lend more, but failed to raise the level of net lending.</p> <p>Sir Mervyn King, the governor of the Bank of England, said the new scheme aims to free up the log jam in credit hitting the economy by offering banks cheap finance on the condition they pass it on to borrowers. He said access to cheaper funding would also encourage competition and drive down lending rates further.</p> <p>The need for a replacement to Project Merlin was underlined today by weak construction figures that showed housebuilding slumped by more than 20%.</p> <p>Construction companies have consistently complained about the reluctance of banks to support their investment plans with loans.

      "bodyText": "A scheme to boost lending to first time buyers and small companies was unveiled today by the Bank of England in a move that ministers hope will inject fresh funds into the ailing UK economy. The \"funding for lending\" scheme, which will take effect next month, was welcomed by the chancellor George Osborne who said the launch of the \u00a380bn emergency facility showed Britain was \"not powerless to act\" in the face of the eurozone crisis. The Bank of England said cheap loans to banks and building societies by the central bank would offset the effects of higher costs faced by financial institutions in wholesale money markets. Business groups said they hoped the scheme would prove more effective than Project Merlin, which the coalition claimed would force banks to lend more, but failed to raise the level of net lending. Sir Mervyn King, the governor of the Bank of England, said the new scheme aims to free up the log jam in credit hitting the economy by offering banks cheap finance on the condition they pass it on to borrowers. He said access to cheaper funding would also encourage competition and drive down lending rates further. The need for a replacement to Project Merlin was underlined today by weak construction figures that showed housebuilding slumped by more than 20%. Construction companies have consistently complained about the reluctance of banks to support their investment plans with loans. A common accusation is that while bank loans may be available, they are tied to high fees, double digit interest rates and demands for significant collateral. Banks have argued the low levels of lending are due to a decrease in demand for loans while the economy struggles to grow. The Office for National Statistics said its construction industry survey found that output overall dropped 6.3% in May on a non-seasonably adjusted basis. Another survey found construction activity fell at its fastest pace in 2-1/2 years in June, while sister surveys found that the manufacturing sector contracted for the second consecutive month and the dominant service sector endured one of its worst months in the past three years. King said joint action by the central bank and the Treasury \"will encourage banks to make loans to families and businesses both cheaper and more easily available\". Osborne said: \"Today's announcement aims to make mortgages and loans cheaper and more easily available, providing welcome support to businesses that want to expand and families aspiring to own their home. He added the initiative would \"inject new confidence into our financial system and support the flow of credit to where it is needed in the real economy \u2013 showing that we are not powerless to act in the face of the eurozone debt storm\". Banks supplement lending based on their reserves of savings and deposits by accessing funds from international lenders. The cost of raising funds on the money markets has increased in recent months as the UK has slipped into recession and the euro crisis has deepened. The scheme will allow banks and building societies to free-up funds tied to loans made to groups like small companies and housing associations. The loans can be swapped for government bonds with the Bank of England. The bonds are the equivalent of cash and can form the basis of new loans. The Bank of England said it will charge a small fee for accessing the facility, but this could be as much as one or two percentage points below the cost of raising funds from other sources. Banks can access funds up to 5% of their current lending, which across the entire sector would add up to \u00a380bn of new lending.",

The MPs on the committee also sit on the Treasury select committee \u2013 Conservative Mark Garnier, Labour's Andy Love and Pat McFadden, and Liberal Democrat John Thurso. Lords will be appointed to the committee as well. Mann is angry at being excluded from the inquiry. He said: \"Both Andrea and I were available for the inquiry and because we are too outspoken we have been blocked. This exposes the inquiry as a total whitewash, with Andrew Tyrie reaching his conclusions in advance of the meetings. We need to get to the bottom of this scandal and I'm therefore setting up my own inquiry into this dreadful mess.\" Speaking to the Guardian, Mann claimed the Tyrie inquiry would not \"get to grips\" with the key issues, partly because it has already nearly completed an investigation into corporate governance. \"Is it going to look in detail at what's being going on at RBS and HBOS?\" he asked. \"Is it going to work hand in glove with the Congress and Senate inquiries? Is it going to be taking evidence from people in the US who are well ahead of the game on this? Is it going to look at the EU proposals on this?\" Mann said he was concerned that the three most \"independent-minded\" Conservatives on the Treasury committee \u2013 Andrea Leadsom, Jesse Norman and David Ruffley \u2013 had not been included on the new commission. It was particularly odd that Leadsom, \"who has proven to be her own person, knowledgeable and prepared to challenge\", was left out, he said. He claimed that the way the committee was set up was \"an absolute dream\" for Ed Miliband, because it confirmed the Labour leader's warnings about a parliamentary inquiry being unsatisfactory. The Bassetlaw MP said he had already started work on his own report. He has two researchers helping him, but said he hoped get more help: \"There's lots of goodwill out there, including people in the banking industry.\" Asked if his inquiry would take evidence in public, he said: \"We will look at the timescale and see what's possible.\" It is understood that MPs were selected on the advice of their parties. A motion to set up the committee has the support of the prime minister, David Cameron, the deputy prime minister, Nick Clegg, the chancellor, George Osborne, Miliband, and the shadow chancellor, Ed Balls. The inquiry is scheduled to report on 18 December \u2013 raising speculation that it may need to met during the summer recess. The inquiry will be able to seek advice from lawyers, to distinguish it from a traditional select committee. It will look wider than the scandal sparked by the record \u00a3290m fine on Barclays for attempting to manipulate the inter-bank lending rate \u2013 examining professional standards and the culture of the banking industry. Bob Diamond quit as chief executive of Barclays following a public outcry and pressure from regulators. The bank's chairman, Marcus Agius, will leave once a new chief executive is found. Tyrie's Treasury committee will continue to hold hearings on Barclays next week, when Jerry del Missier, the chief operating officer who quit alongside Diamond, will appear. Officials from the Financial Services Authority are also being called, including its chairman, Lord Turner.",
