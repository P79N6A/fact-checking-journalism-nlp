      "bodyText": "Friday was market day in Totnes and in spite of the rain the streets were teeming. The fishmongers, the soap makers and the bakers were doing a brisk trade and the high street's three butcher's shops were packed. The small Devon town of 8,500 people has never really been in the headlines in its near 1,000-year history. The Norman castle has never been the scene of great battles or sieges and the town huddled on its southern slopes has quietly prospered, avoiding the envious eyes of brigands and raiders. But this weekend the citizens of Totnes are celebrating victory in a rare battle which has grabbed the attention of the country. The town defeated the attempts of the high-street chain Costa Coffee to open a branch and dilute the charms of their independent and colourful high street. Pruw Boswell, the mayor, was jubilant but slightly tired after her breakfast show interviews. \"You don't mess with Totnes,\" she said, as her husband placed her mayoral regalia over her head in preparation for an official engagement. \"It might seem like a quiet place where you can roll in and do what you want, but we have shown Costa that we are the mouse that roared.\" Cafe owners were happy that a threat to business has been removed, while citizens enjoyed a local victory. Tony Kershaw, the owner of La Fourchette, a high-street cafe and restaurant, said everybody was pleased at the news. \"There was a definite split in the town, but even people who wanted Costa to come would say that deep down they were pleased with their decision. Although Costa are probably better than most, they still produce a generic coffee. They are the McDonald's of the coffee world, the lowest common denominator,\" he said as he laid out cakes on his counter on Friday. Costa Coffee, Britain's largest cafe chain, with twice as many outlets as Starbucks, announced its plans to open in Totnes in May and has faced widespread opposition since. Totnes High Street has a Superdrug and WH Smith, but the vast majority of its shops are independent retailers, a sight rarely seen in Britain today. It also has 42 places which sell coffee, ranging from a hotel to vegan and Middle Eastern cafes. \"We have a tradition of independence and a history of being different. We had to protect the special ambience that visitors enjoy and stop Totnes from becoming just another 'clone town,' with identical shops and cafes\" said the mayor. Costa outbid local businesses for a prime lease and boasted of its successes in overcoming local opposition. But Totnes was not deterred. Citizens set up a campaign with a website, notocosta.co.uk, with stylish Trainspotting-style posters. Almost 6,000 people signed a petition and around 300 wrote to the council to object. But South Hams councillors agreed to Costa's application. There was nothing to stop Costa opening, but its directors agreed to a suggestion by the local Conservative MP, Sarah Wollaston, to visit Totnes and meet local representatives. Three weeks ago Chris Rogers, the new managing director of Costa, and two fellow directors arrived at the Totnes Conservative Club, an imposing two-storey building in two tones of blue. One of the directors began what witnesses described as a \"well-oiled\" presentation. He told the residents he was not there to placate or persuade them \u2013 before trying to do exactly that. He told the meeting of the benefits a Costa cafe could bring. Costa would not threaten existing coffee shops and would add to the vibrancy of the town. The residents had no need to worry about other companies following in the wake of Costa because they would not like the kind of properties available. The new Costa cafe, he said, would provide a place where people could come together. At this point his audience burst into laughter at the director's clearest demonstration of lack of local knowledge. The representatives explained to the Costa directors how it could damage the local economy and compromise Totnes's tourist charms. Last week, Costa arranged to meet Wollaston at the House of Commons. \"When they asked for the meeting I feared the worst, but I was overjoyed with their decision. This was not a campaign against Costa per se, and I think other companies could take a leaf out of their book,\" she said. Rogers said Costa had recognised the strength of feeling and taken into account the specific circumstances. \"Totnes is a town with a long and proud history of independent retailers. It has one of the lowest percentages of branded stores of any town of its size in the UK, very few empty shop fronts, as well as a very high proportion of places selling coffee,\" he wrote in a letter also signed by the mayor and the MP. Frances Northrop, head of the local community development organisation, who attended the meeting, said she was surprised Costa had withdrawn. \"I thought it was inevitable. When a company has an expansion policy, it's quite unusual for the community to intervene. The interests of communities and big business are at cross purposes,\" she said. She explained that the opposition was not based on snobbery or aesthetics, but on an understanding of the local economy. \"We have brought together a lot of local producers and retailers and we know a lot about the local food economy and how strong it is and also how fragile it is,\" she said. \"When Costa put in their planning application, it was obvious the threat to local business was massive, not just the coffee shops but their suppliers as well. It is the nature of Costa that they offer standardised products produced at centralised factories. This is how they drive down their prices to maximise their profits. \"We want to keep money circulating locally. We support family businesses that use a local IT company, buy their food locally. Obviously they don't get their coffee locally. They are also a family to their staff. They spend their money locally where they live and they send their children to school. It seems like a good system; that's the beauty of our high street. It's got more independents than chain stores and that's part of its charm to visitors,\" said Northrop.",

      "bodyText": "Politicians on both sides of the divide reached for the Bumper Book of Cliches last week as they reacted to the news that the double-dip recession was over. For George Osborne, it was evidence that his policies had put us \"on the right track\"; while Ed Balls \u2013 whose analysis of the economy has repeatedly been proved correct over the past two years \u2013 insisted this was \"no time for complacency\" (is there ever a time?). While Labour was desperate not to be seen as dismissive of the strongest quarter's GDP growth in five years, Osborne was scrupulously careful to avoid triumphalism, attributing the long-delayed recovery to \"the hard work of millions of people and businesses\". Behind the scenes, meanwhile, Treasury officials were reminding everyone that strong early GDP estimates can be revised down, and that growth was boosted by one-off factors \u2013 not least the Olympics \u2013 that won't be repeated in coming quarters. These carefully choreographed pronouncements reflect the fact that today's politicians are being forced to rewrite the script as they go along, to adjust to a new economic reality. Just how much has changed emerged in two other pieces of news last week, away from the short-term noise of one quarter's numbers. The first was the Office for National Statistics' latest report on the country's wellbeing. David Cameron has asked the ONS to look into how best to lift the lid off the traditional measures of economic output and gauge families' life satisfaction \u2013 what used to be known as the elusive \"feelgood factor\". In last week's study, the latest in a series, the ONS found that net national income per head, which experts including Joseph Stiglitz have found to be a better indicator of families' living standards than raw GDP, had declined by more than 13% from its pre-crisis peak by the summer of this year \u2013 far sharper than the 4% drop in GDP. There are a number of reasons for this, not least the clobbering many people's incomes have taken from rising inflation, caused by rocketing commodity prices and the VAT increase. And with inflation drifting down (though it may blip up again this autumn as fuel prices rise), the squeeze should start to ease slightly in the coming months. But the overall message was that even though unemployment has risen less dramatically than in previous recessions, living standards have taken a drastic hit. Many households up and down the country are having to permanently adjust their hopes for the future \u2013 downwards. Sir Mervyn King made much the same point in his wide-ranging speech in Wales last week. Aside from a dash of teary-eyed Olympics nostalgia, from which it seems no one is immune (\"recall that balmy night in late July \u2026 the sound of Welsh children singing Cwm Rhondda on that beautiful beach in Rhossili filled the Olympic stadium\"), the Bank of England governor used his appearance to warn that the UK, along with much of the industrialised world, may be working through the after-effects of the crisis for years. \"After a period of lopsided expansion, with growing trade deficits and debt levels, and a collapse of their banking systems, advanced economies across the world are facing a huge adjustment. Such is the scale of the global adjustment required that the generation we hope to inspire may live under its shadow for a long time to come,\" he said. He talked about a \"downward correction of expectations about future incomes and wealth\" that will inevitably change consumer behaviour and slowly start to shift the shape of the economy. It's hard to know how much the productive capacity of the economy has been damaged by those years of \"lopsided\" growth; but an army of export champions won't spring up overnight to replace jobs lost on boarded-up high streets, and Ford's announcement that it is laying off up to 1,400 workers as demand from the continent shrinks demonstrates the scale of the challenge. But the governor clearly believes we may be facing a long-drawn-out reckoning. In practical terms, that may mean thousands more loans go sour, and businesses go under, as it becomes increasingly clear we are not destined for a textbook recovery and instead face a period of sluggish growth \u2013 what Danny Gabay of consultancy Fathom calls \"bumping along the bottom\". For politicians weaned on boom and bust, recession and recovery, such a long period of pain will require a marked change of policies \u2013 and language. \"Pre-distribution\" is Ed Miliband's first stab at a response to an economic world in which growth is weak or non-existent and government is too busy paying down the debts of the past to borrow any more from the future \u2013 though what it means in policy terms is, so far, harder to pin down. Cameron's remark that \"the good news will keep on coming\" at prime minister's questions last week sounded distinctly like the clapped-out old politics of riding recovery to seal an election victory. But Osborne's more measured response to the GDP figures suggests that he's well aware the improvement may be short-lived; that even if it comes, it may not improve families' fortunes as much as they hope; and that in order to win over voters, he will have to stress instead the long-term, more nebulous project of building a better economy. The panicked \"back us or we'll turn into Greece\" rhetoric of the 2010 election can hardly be applied to an economy that's been flatlining for years. Instead, expect to see politicians at both ends of the spectrum reaching for a different vocabulary \u2013 stressing aspiration, wellbeing and fairness over clear-cut, mathematically measurable concepts such as recession and growth.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A nuclear fuel pellet the size of your little finger provides more energy than 800 kilograms of coal or 650 litres of oil \u2013 and all without belching any carbon dioxide or other fumes into the atmosphere. But the intense power of uranium, the raw material of nuclear fuel, was demonstrated to the world by the Fukushima disaster last year. Its price on global markets has collapsed, from a record $136 a pound in 2007 to just $44 last week \u2013 a slump so severe that some of the world's biggest miners have decided they're better off leaving the mineral in the ground. The market suffered further blows in the last month or so as several developed-world governments announced or confirmed plans to move away from atomic power for good. But even as the west retreats, the nuclear industry may be about to rise again \u2013 in the developing world. In the last few days, China announced plans to restart its massive \u00a3170bn reactor building programme, intended to create generating capacity so large that it could power the whole of Spain. Last March, Japan went into lockdown and shut all of its nuclear plants, which had provided 30% of the nation's electricity. Fears of a nuclear apocalypse rippled across the globe, turning the lights out at reactors around the world, and many of them still lie idle 18 months later. Japan, which is now running a series of expensive and polluting diesel generators at 100% capacity to replace its nuclear fleet, has announced plans to completely end its reliance on nuclear power by 2040, at an estimated cost of $620bn. Germany and Belgium are also giving up on nuclear power, while Italy has cancelled a long-planned move back to it, and even France \u2013 the most pro-nuclear country in the world \u2013 is scaling things down. The future of the UK's nuclear ambitions also hangs in the balance after Vincent de Rivaz, the chief executive of EDF Energy, the French company charged with building new reactors in the UK, told parliament the company had yet to make up its mind whether it was worth building plants without support from the government. Two German companies \u2013 RWE and E.ON \u2013 have already pulled out of the Horizon joint venture to build new nuclear plants in the UK. \"It is the same as after Chernobyl. There are huge question marks hanging over whether we should have [nuclear power] \u2013 a lot of countries are umm-ing and err-ing,\" says Heenal Patel, a senior industrial analyst at Bloomberg Industries. Patel says President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande's decision to close France's oldest nuclear plant last month, and his commitment to lowering the country's dependence on nuclear power from 75% to 50% of total electricity demand, has caused the biggest waves in the industry: \"If the world's most pro-nuclear country is blowing cold it is noticed by other countries.\" Uranium miners have noticed the cool wind too. This summer, BHP Billiton, the giant Anglo-Australian mining group, shelved plans for the world's largest open-pit copper and uran, and announced it has no plans to build or acquire other uranium minesium mine in south Australia. The \u00a312bn Olympic Dam mega-project would have transformed the mine 350 miles north of Adelaide into a massive pit capable of producing 19,000 tonnes of uranium a year. Explaining the decision to stall the project, Marius Kloppers, BHP's chief executive, said demand for uranium had \"collapsed\". BHP has also sold off its Yeelirrie uranium field in Western Australia. Canada's Cameco, the world's third-largest uranium miner, has said it is only worth pressing ahead with its Kintyre uranium project in Australia's Great Sandy Desert if the uranium price climbs back above $67 a pound. Patel said that if the uranium price keeps falling, \"manufacturers are going to look to keep it in the ground \u2026 That's the great thing about being a mining company: you can decide whether to produce or not. The uranium isn't going anywhere.\" Paladin Energy, which mines uranium in Malawi and Namibia (the largest sources of uranium oxide, or \"yellowcake\", after Kazakhstan, Canada and Australia), has warned that if the price stays depressed, supply will dip by 25% by 2020. Chief executive John Borshoff says his analysis \"confirms a supply industry in crisis, in which production is unable to meet emerging requirements in the short to medium term\". Another, more unusual, source of uranium could also run dry soon. At present, about 16% of the world's uranium (and half of supplies used in American reactors) come from Soviet nuclear weapons. The \"megatons to megawatts\" programme, which formed part of the 1993 US-Russia non-proliferation treaty, has seen highly enriched uranium from the equivalent of 18,000 Russian warheads converted to lower-grade fuel for use at power plants in the US cities at which they were once aimed. But the programme is due to come to an end next year. Despite the current collapse in demand, analysts say the uranium price will recover in the long term. The rapacious growth of China and India will be dependent on nuclear fuel, and the oil-rich Gulf nations are planning big forays into nuclear so that they can extend the lifetime of their highly profitable oil exports. There are 65 reactors being built around the world, and 69% of them are in the fast-growing Bric countries (Brazil, Russia, India and China). Beijing's ambitious programme will increase nuclear from 2% to 5% of the country's electricity supply by 2020, and make China the world's biggest market for new nuclear equipment. India \u2013 which lacks fossil fuel resources and has been growing so fast that its electricity supply is falling 12% short at peak hours, causing frequent blackouts \u2013 is also planning a massive expansion programme. The country hopes nuclear will account for 50% of its electricity needs by 2050, up from just 3.7% last year. To raise nuclear output, India has had to convince uranium producers to provide supplies, despite long-held concerns over India's nuclear weapons programme. Four years ago, the 46-nation Nuclear Suppliers Group exempted India from a 30-year ban on exports to countries that have failed to sign the nuclear non-proliferation treaty after receiving assurances that no nuclear imports would find their way to the military. This month Manmohan Singh, India's prime minister, held talks with his Australian counterpart Julia Gillard, with the aim of reversing Australia's decision to maintain its own ban on exports to India. Lifting the ban will boost Australia's miners, which produced 7,529 tonnes of uranium worth A$782m (\u00a3500m) last year, but could cause problems at home: nuclear power is a sensitive topic in a country that has decide not to build any nuclear plants despite having the world's largest uranium reserves. Patel reckons Japan will be forced to follow China and India and re-embrace nuclear despite the memories of Fukushima. \"Like India, they don't have a huge amount of natural resources, and that's why Japan was so into nuclear \u2026 They have had to import a whole lot more oil and gas, which is expensive and not great for energy security.\"",

      "standfirst": "After a rancorous court battle, the reclusive twins look certain to seize the ailing group that owns some of London's best-known five-star brands", 
      "body": "<p>When the Art Deco doors of Claridge's hotel reopened to the world's well-to-do in 1929 \u2013 oblivious to the looming Great Depression \u2013 they revealed a refurbishment that set the gold standard for Mayfair luxury which endures to this day.</p> <p>Afternoon tea is still served in four sittings from 3pm in the hotel's mirrored foyer, attracting a cast of characters who would not look out of place in a PG Wodehouse tale. Cucumber sandwiches and Earl Grey are consumed, as ever they were, over chatter and clinking china to the strains of light piano melodies.</p> <p>Behind the genteel nostalgia, however, the last two years have placed Claridge's at the centre of one of the most poisonous and unedifying scrambles for control of a London landmark in modern times.</p> <p>In a bygone era, such a disagreement might have been settled over cigars in the hotel's Fumoir bar, but this 21st century clash has played out in the high court, racking up legal bills estimated to be in excess of \u00a325m.</p> <p>At the centre of the spat is Irish property tycoon Paddy McKillen, a usually low-profile investor best known for some hotel co-investments in Dublin with U2 band members Bono and The Edge. In 2004 he and fellow property speculator Derek Quinlan led a consortium of Irish investors who took on colossal loans to acquire the Savoy Group. The business comprised four of London's most prestigious five-star hotels: Claridge's, the Savoy, the Berkeley and the Connaught. After the quick sale of the Savoy, the business was renamed Maybourne; its holding company was Coroin.</p> <p>Today McKillen cuts an isolated figure, despite holding just over a third of Coroin's shares. He is the last man holding out against surrendering control to Sir David and Sir Frederick Barclay, already owners of the nearby Ritz hotel.</p> <p>The septuagenarian twins, who also own the <em>Telegraph</em> newspaper titles, have long coveted Claridge's, and now Coroin is poised to fall into their grasp. Rearguard court actions by McKillen, alleging that illegal means were used by the Barclays to secure creeping control over the holding company, have failed. An appeal application remains outstanding, but it feels to many concerned that the end of this bitter saga is fast approaching.</p> <p>An increasingly inevitable-looking denouement \u2013 which may start to play out as early as this week \u2013 is likely to seal the brothers' hard-fought victory over rival investors who have been circling the luxury hotel group ever since its leading shareholders turned against one another in 2010 and the business began to hurtle towards a debt crisis.</p> <p>Coroin's towering debts of \u00a3660m fall due for repayment on Wednesday and without a major injection of capital, the company does not appear to have the capacity to meet that deadline. The loans are owned by the Barclay brothers, leaving them in a powerful position.</p> <p>Among those whom the Barclays appear to have outsmarted are Qatar's ruling Al Thani family and Manchester City FC owner Sheikh Mansour, both of whom had looked seriously at seizing control of the five-star hotels \u2013 well established as favoured haunts for super-rich Middle Eastern visitors. To a lesser degree, others who spied an opportunity to prosper from the pandemonium at Coroin included Mayfair financial engineer Robert Tchenguiz and Malaysian tycoon Jho Low.</p> <p>On their behalf and others', attempts were made to navigate the toxic mix of feuding shareholders and distressed debt. Efforts to force a breakthrough came from advisers at Goldman Sachs, Barclays and Lazard as well as Middle Eastern deal broker Amanda Staveley and even former PM Tony Blair. None was able to pull off a decisive deal.</p> <p>On occasion the feuding bordered on farce. In one submission to the court, McKillen recalled how he believed he had deliberately been made to feel awkward during a difficult meeting with Sir Frederick Barclay at the Ritz.</p> <p>\"I specifically remember \u2026 the concierge introduced me to Sir Frederick. However, he initially ignored me and instead asked the concierge why I had been allowed to enter the hotel without wearing a tie. I thought this was a joke: however, Sir Frederick continued to reprimand the concierge ... I felt he intended to cause me embarrassment.\"</p> <p>McKillen's ire stemmed from what appeared to him to be an illegal alliance forged by his old friend Quinlan with the Barclays early last year. Quinlan, a former Dublin tax inspector who had, in better times, transformed himself into one of Europe's most acquisitive property barons, was all but bankrupt. Years ago, he had pledged his one-third stake in Coroin and other assets as collateral for loans from fallen Irish banks. Following the 2008 banking crisis, these loans passed to Nama, Ireland's state-owned toxic loan agency.</p> <p>Cleverly, the Barclay brothers had persuaded Quinlan to enter into a series of agreements that gave them effective control of his stake in Coroin without actually formally buying it from him. For good measure, the brothers went on to buy from Nama the debts against which Quinlan's Coroin shares had been put up as security.</p> <p>This enraged McKillen. Not only did it kill a rescue deal he was trying to advance with the Al Thanis, but was, he claimed, in breach of an agreement between Coroin's original shareholders.</p> <p>The agreement had been designed to bind investors in a common purpose, eliminating suspicion that they might betray one another. Central to it was an undertaking not to sell shares without first offering fellow consortium members the opportunity to buy them. This provision, known as pre-emption rights, was intended to remove the threat of one shareholder, or an outside party, taking a majority interest.</p> <p>At about the same time as striking a deal with Quinlan, the Barclays also snapped up a second holding in Coroin of close to one third, buying out the family interests of wealthy Irishman Peter Green.

      "bodyText": "When the Art Deco doors of Claridge's hotel reopened to the world's well-to-do in 1929 \u2013 oblivious to the looming Great Depression \u2013 they revealed a refurbishment that set the gold standard for Mayfair luxury which endures to this day. Afternoon tea is still served in four sittings from 3pm in the hotel's mirrored foyer, attracting a cast of characters who would not look out of place in a PG Wodehouse tale. Cucumber sandwiches and Earl Grey are consumed, as ever they were, over chatter and clinking china to the strains of light piano melodies. Behind the genteel nostalgia, however, the last two years have placed Claridge's at the centre of one of the most poisonous and unedifying scrambles for control of a London landmark in modern times. In a bygone era, such a disagreement might have been settled over cigars in the hotel's Fumoir bar, but this 21st century clash has played out in the high court, racking up legal bills estimated to be in excess of \u00a325m. At the centre of the spat is Irish property tycoon Paddy McKillen, a usually low-profile investor best known for some hotel co-investments in Dublin with U2 band members Bono and The Edge. In 2004 he and fellow property speculator Derek Quinlan led a consortium of Irish investors who took on colossal loans to acquire the Savoy Group. The business comprised four of London's most prestigious five-star hotels: Claridge's, the Savoy, the Berkeley and the Connaught. After the quick sale of the Savoy, the business was renamed Maybourne; its holding company was Coroin. Today McKillen cuts an isolated figure, despite holding just over a third of Coroin's shares. He is the last man holding out against surrendering control to Sir David and Sir Frederick Barclay, already owners of the nearby Ritz hotel. The septuagenarian twins, who also own the Telegraph newspaper titles, have long coveted Claridge's, and now Coroin is poised to fall into their grasp. Rearguard court actions by McKillen, alleging that illegal means were used by the Barclays to secure creeping control over the holding company, have failed. An appeal application remains outstanding, but it feels to many concerned that the end of this bitter saga is fast approaching. An increasingly inevitable-looking denouement \u2013 which may start to play out as early as this week \u2013 is likely to seal the brothers' hard-fought victory over rival investors who have been circling the luxury hotel group ever since its leading shareholders turned against one another in 2010 and the business began to hurtle towards a debt crisis. Coroin's towering debts of \u00a3660m fall due for repayment on Wednesday and without a major injection of capital, the company does not appear to have the capacity to meet that deadline. The loans are owned by the Barclay brothers, leaving them in a powerful position. Among those whom the Barclays appear to have outsmarted are Qatar's ruling Al Thani family and Manchester City FC owner Sheikh Mansour, both of whom had looked seriously at seizing control of the five-star hotels \u2013 well established as favoured haunts for super-rich Middle Eastern visitors. To a lesser degree, others who spied an opportunity to prosper from the pandemonium at Coroin included Mayfair financial engineer Robert Tchenguiz and Malaysian tycoon Jho Low. On their behalf and others', attempts were made to navigate the toxic mix of feuding shareholders and distressed debt. Efforts to force a breakthrough came from advisers at Goldman Sachs, Barclays and Lazard as well as Middle Eastern deal broker Amanda Staveley and even former PM Tony Blair. None was able to pull off a decisive deal. On occasion the feuding bordered on farce. In one submission to the court, McKillen recalled how he believed he had deliberately been made to feel awkward during a difficult meeting with Sir Frederick Barclay at the Ritz. \"I specifically remember \u2026 the concierge introduced me to Sir Frederick. However, he initially ignored me and instead asked the concierge why I had been allowed to enter the hotel without wearing a tie. I thought this was a joke: however, Sir Frederick continued to reprimand the concierge ... I felt he intended to cause me embarrassment.\" McKillen's ire stemmed from what appeared to him to be an illegal alliance forged by his old friend Quinlan with the Barclays early last year. Quinlan, a former Dublin tax inspector who had, in better times, transformed himself into one of Europe's most acquisitive property barons, was all but bankrupt. Years ago, he had pledged his one-third stake in Coroin and other assets as collateral for loans from fallen Irish banks. Following the 2008 banking crisis, these loans passed to Nama, Ireland's state-owned toxic loan agency. Cleverly, the Barclay brothers had persuaded Quinlan to enter into a series of agreements that gave them effective control of his stake in Coroin without actually formally buying it from him. For good measure, the brothers went on to buy from Nama the debts against which Quinlan's Coroin shares had been put up as security. This enraged McKillen. Not only did it kill a rescue deal he was trying to advance with the Al Thanis, but was, he claimed, in breach of an agreement between Coroin's original shareholders. The agreement had been designed to bind investors in a common purpose, eliminating suspicion that they might betray one another. Central to it was an undertaking not to sell shares without first offering fellow consortium members the opportunity to buy them. This provision, known as pre-emption rights, was intended to remove the threat of one shareholder, or an outside party, taking a majority interest. At about the same time as striking a deal with Quinlan, the Barclays also snapped up a second holding in Coroin of close to one third, buying out the family interests of wealthy Irishman Peter Green. Pre-emption rights were not triggered as they bought a Cypriot investment vehicle that owned the shares, rather than the shares themselves. McKillen was incandescent with rage and took to the courts. Over several months, evidence spilled out detailing the minutiae of the dealings between the Barclays and Quinlan. Lawyers for the Barclays admitted the twins had effectively started to bankroll the financially distressed Quinlan from late 2010, handing out loans to pay off a tax bill and funding a very comfortable life for the Irishman and his family in Putney, west London. \"My brother and I deeply resent the suggestion that we have been party to an unlawful conspiracy,\" Sir Frederick said in a witness statement, noting that his family had long been friendly with the Quinlans. \"Helping the Quinlan family in their time of need was something that I will never regret and I would not hesitate to do it again if necessary, regardless of anything to do with Coroin, which is irrelevant to how I feel on this issue.\" Hitting back at the behaviour of McKillen, Sir Frederick's statement recalled one telephone row. \"He began with a barrage of what I can only describe as foul-mouthed abuse about Mr Quinlan, calling him a fat so-and-so and using a stream of four-letter words about him \u2026 I do not like or tolerate swearing. I was not going to listen to Mr McKillen's rantings and I cut off the call.\" McKillen's lawyers invited the court to make much of the notoriously private brothers' decision not to attend court and face cross-examination. Living in Monaco and a in castle on their private Channel Island of Brecqhou, the Barclays are rarely photographed and are said to fear kidnapping. McKillen's legal team also sought to draw dark inferences over deleted text messages, emails sent indirectly through the accounts of Barclay relatives, and a partially destroyed laptop belonging to Richard Faber, a senior executive in the family business and Sir Frederick's former son-in-law.

While it's relatively easy to find heavyweight generalists to appoint as non-execs \u2013 and a number of women have built up a portfolio of such posts \u2013 it's harder to ensure that managers in an organisation work to nurture talented women for senior executive roles. Carroll's right that tokenism at the top helps no one: companies must also take a good look at what's going on well below board level.",
