      "bodyText": "The FTSE 100 has recorded its best weekly performance since December 2011 After an initial slump in the first two trading days following the Brexit vote, the index of Britain\u2019s top 100 companies regained all its losses by Wednesday and is now at its best level since last August. The remarkable rebound has surprised analysts, with Chris Beauchamp, a senior market analyst at the spread betting group IG, saying: \u201cOf all the post-Brexit outcomes discussed across the City over the past few months, \u2018buying frenzy\u2019 was not one that was viewed as very likely.\u201d Part of the reason for the recovery is the growing belief that article 50, the mechanism to trigger the UK leaving the EU, will not be triggered for months, whoever ends up with the prime minister\u2019s job. So in some senses it is business as usual for the moment, and the City tends to take a rather short-term view of events. On top of that, the falls in the immediate aftermath of the vote convinced many investors there were bargains to be had. The increases have been seen almost across the board, from safer shares such as utilities which have regular income streams, to mining groups and food and drink businesses. But the pound has been plunging. Surely that\u2019s bad news? For holidaymakers, yes. But for the FTSE 100 it helps those companies who have large overseas earnings, and these account for about 77% of the index. As the pound falls against the dollar and euro, exporters find their goods are cheaper for overseas customers to buy which boosts their sales and profits. Thursday\u2019s comments from the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, hinting at further interest rate cuts in the summer, have put more pressure on the pound, and conversely given the FTSE 100 another boost. With interest rates so low, the dividend yield on the FTSE 100 at about 3.5% also makes investing in the market an attractive option rather than relying on keeping cash in the bank. What about gilts? They are a safe bet, surely? Gilts \u2013 UK government bonds \u2013 have indeed been rising, but this has meant the yield or dividend payment has been falling. Ten-year gilt yields are below 1% for the first time and the two-year gilt yield is in negative territory, unprecedented for the UK. That effectively means anyone who buys this gilt is paying the UK government for lending it money, even though credit rating agencies downgraded UK debt after the Brexit vote. But generally, everything looks rosy in the circumstances? Not exactly. The FTSE 100 might appear to have shrugged off Brexit, but in dollar and euro terms it is still underperforming following the fall in sterling. And not everything is gaining ground. Housebuilders and UK banks have been among the hardest hit on fears of a UK recession and falling consumer spending. What\u2019s happening elsewhere? It\u2019s bit of a different picture. The FTSE 250 mid-cap index \u2013 the next biggest listed UK companies below the leading index \u2013 is struggling. It is still 5% below the level it had reached on the day of the referendum. The companies in the mid-cap index are far more exposed to the domestic UK economy than those in the FTSE 100. And so with predictions of possible recession following the Brexit vote \u2013 one of the reasons for Carney\u2019s rate cut hints \u2013 they are under pressure. As ratings agency Fitch said when it cut the UK\u2019s credit rating from AA+ to AA earlier this week, the decision to leave the EU would have \u201ca negative impact on the UK economy, public finances and political continuity\u201d. It said Britain faced \u201cabrupt slowdown in short-term GDP growth\u201d. What have been the biggest risers and fallers? The biggest gains since the referendum have been made by gold miners, exporters with big dollar earnings, and companies with stable incomes such as pharmaceutical groups, utilities, and food and drink companies. Housebuilders, banks and airlines have led the fallers. The top FTSE 100 risers since the referendum: Fresnillo +42% Randgold Resources +36% AstraZeneca +15.5% Shire +15.4% BP +15% Diageo +14.9% Mediclinic +14.9% British American Tobacco +14.5% Unilever +13.7% National Grid +12.66% The top FTSE 100 fallers: Royal Bank of Scotland -32% EasyJet -28.7% Barratt Developments -28% International Airlines Group (BA owner) -27.8% Taylor Wimpey -27.5% Persimmon -26.5% Barclays -25.1% Lloyds Banking Group -24.6% Travis Perkins -24% Dixons Carphone -24% The top FTSE 250 risers: Acacia Mining +33.9% Centamin +26.4% Polymetal International +20.5% Sophos Group +18.1% Cairn Energy +10.1% Pennon Group +9.8% UBM +9.7% Tate &amp; Lyle +9.6% Rotork +9.2% JPMorgan Emerging Markets +8.9% The top FTSE 250 fallers: Shawbrook Group -42% Aldermore Group -41.7% OneSavings Bank -37.5% Crest Nicholson -35.4% Grafton Group 32.4% Countrywide -30.7% Galliford Try -30.6% Ibstock -30% Bellway -30% Virgin Money -29.9% What have private investors been buying? Quite a lot, by all accounts. Investment management group Hargreaves Lansdown said that last week private investors placed four times as many share deals as they did in a normal week. And 70% of the trades had been buys. The most popular purchases at Hargreaves were companies that suffered the most in the initial sell-off immediately after the poll result: Lloyds Banking Group Barclays Taylor Wimpey Legal &amp; General Group EasyJet Aviva Royal Bank of Scotland Barratt Developments Persimmon ITV Online trading group TD Direct Investing said it had seen three times more trading volume since the referendum than this time last year. Its chief investment officer, Michelle McGrade, said: \u201cThe buy-to-sell ratio of our top two traded stocks, Lloyds and Barclays, stand at 10:1 and 9.4:1 respectively. For Centrica, our third top traded stock, we are seeing a whopping 37:1 in favour of buying. Gold also remains a safe haven for investors with the number of customers holding funds with exposure to gold increasing by 30% since the start of the year \u2013 a further 6% increase since the same time last month.\u201d Meanwhile, company directors including the Lloyds boss, Ant\u00f3nio Horta Os\u00f3rio, and the Berkeley Group founder, Tony Pidgley, have also been buying shares in their own companies following the declines. According to the Financial Times, 100 executives in the FTSE 100 and 250 bought \u00a314.3m worth of shares in the past week. What about the outlook? The continuing weakness in the pound could well help the FTSE 100 hold on to its gains, although there is also the possibility that investors may decide to cash in some of their recent gains. A summer interest rate cut would also help leading shares, and keep the pressure on sterling. But with the continuing political uncertainty and the prospect of some tricky negotiations between the UK and the EU about their future relationship, there is likely to be continuing volatility in the market. The approaching holiday season will lead to lower trading volumes, which tend to exaggerate share movements in both directions. And companies with large UK earnings will still struggle as domestic growth slows. If the base rate falls, could some people effectively be getting free money from their mortgage lenders? No. When the base rate was last cut there were some borrowers whose mortgage payments should have turned negative because they were on a rate that was below the Bank\u2019s. At Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester, for example, there were customers on trackers 1.01 percentage points below the base rate, while Halifax had offered a deal of base rate minus 0.52 percentage points. These deals, which have since finished, never went negative \u2013 the lowest rate anyone paid was 0.001%. There are some customers on lifetime deals that are not very far above the base rate. Woolwich and C&amp;G have both offered mortgages at Bank base plus 0.17 percentage points for the whole of the mortgage term, while Chesham building society, which is now part of Skipton, previously offered a rate just 0.09 above. If the base rate was cut to zero, the small number of borrowers lucky enough to be on the Chesham deal will see their interest payments shrink. Will lenders stop offering mortgages on London flats? On Wednesday Singaporean bank UOB suspended lending on London property and other banks in the country warned investors to be cautious. Investors in the far east have been courted by developers and estate agents selling new build apartments off-plan, and the warnings suggest banks are concerned that prices might be heading downwards. During the last financial crisis UK lenders put the brakes on lending on new builds, reducing lending limits. The mortgage broker David Hollingworth doesn\u2019t expect to see a new crackdown. \u201cLoan to values on new builds have never returned to 95%, and some lenders still have different limits for flats and houses,\u201d he said.",

    "webTitle": "This George is not for turning: austerity still in vogue for Osborne", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "When George Osborne announced the age of austerity in his 2010 budget the were plenty of critics. What is often forgotten was the formidable consensus among the world\u2019s most respected economic bodies fighting his corner. Anyone who questioned Osborne\u2019s wisdom of generating growth by slashing public spending was met by a praetorian guard of experts drawn from the world\u2019s major think tanks and top universities. Many of them have performed dramatic U-turns, usually without much fanfare. Finance ministers in the main have stuck to their hard line austerity policies. One of them is Osborne, who, despite ditching his commitment to achieve a budget surplus by 2020, remains aligned with his friend Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, the German finance minister and Europe\u2019s austerian-in-chief. Labour\u2019s shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, might have welcomed his opposite number into the anti-austerity camp, but this Osborne\u2019s not for turning. He still believes that reducing the size of the state is necessary for a successful economy. He believed it in 2012 when he relaxed the pace of austerity in response to the euro-crisis and the prospect of Greece going bust, and he believes it now. And if it wasn\u2019t politically convenient as part of his battle with Conservative Brexiters to make a big deal of the current mild slowdown in GDP growth, which at the moment is nothing like as bad as the 2012 meltdown in Athens, he would be sticking to his austerity guns with even deeper cuts to meet his original aim. On Osborne\u2019s watch, the number of Britain\u2019s civil servants by some counts is at its lowest level for 75 years, councils are heading towards providing the legal minimum to people entitled to mental health and elderly care services, while NHS spending is predicted to fall more than \u00a320bn short of what is needed in 2020. Planned cuts for the next four years will go ahead, including a \u00a312bn welfare spending reduction. And the cuts so far have been anything but fair. A study for the Joseph Rowntree Foundation last year found that social care spending fell by \u00a365 per capita, or 14% adjusted for inflation, in the UK\u2019s most deprived communities between 2010 and 2015 and at the same time increased by \u00a328 per capita, or 8% in the least deprived communities. Never mind that the International Monetary Fund has called for higher public investment spending on transport, housing and the digital infrastructure and the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development has said much the same. Under the Treasury\u2019s current plans, public spending on infrastructure is scheduled to fall sharply from 2018. Earlier this week the boss of the European Central Bank, Mario Draghi, made a yet another speech calling for governments to end their reliance on cheap central bank money to keep their economies afloat and start spending some of their own. Mark Carney made much the same point on Thursday in a speech that was mostly about his plans to protect the financial system from collapse following the vote to leave the European Union, but found space to chide the government for not joining him by taking some action of its own to boost growth in the economy. Osborne is not going to pay heed. Maybe his successor will have a change of heart. It seems unlikely. A budget in the autumn in response to a threatened downturn could still happen, and that could still heap more pain on the public sector and least well off.",

      "body": "<p>When George Osborne announced the age of austerity in his 2010 budget the were plenty of critics. What is often forgotten was the formidable consensus among the world\u2019s most respected economic bodies fighting his corner.</p> <p>Anyone who questioned Osborne\u2019s wisdom of generating growth by slashing public spending was met by a praetorian guard of experts drawn from the world\u2019s major think tanks and top universities. </p> <p>Many of them have performed dramatic U-turns, usually without much fanfare. Finance ministers in the main have stuck to their hard line austerity policies.</p> <p>One of them is Osborne, who, despite <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/01/george-osborne-scraps-2020-budget-surplus-plan\">ditching his commitment to achieve a budget surplus</a> by 2020, remains aligned with his friend Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, the German finance minister and Europe\u2019s austerian-in-chief.</p> <p>Labour\u2019s shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, might have welcomed his opposite number into the anti-austerity camp, but this Osborne\u2019s not for turning.<br></p> <p>He still believes that reducing the size of the state is necessary for a successful economy. He believed it in 2012 when he relaxed the pace of austerity in response to the euro-crisis and the prospect of Greece going bust, and he believes it now. </p> <p>And if it wasn\u2019t politically convenient as part of his battle with Conservative Brexiters to make a big deal of the current mild slowdown in GDP growth, which at the moment is nothing like as bad as the 2012 meltdown in Athens, he would be sticking to his austerity guns with even deeper cuts to meet his original aim.</p> <p>On Osborne\u2019s watch, the number of Britain\u2019s civil servants by some counts is at its lowest level for 75 years, councils are heading towards providing the legal minimum to people entitled to mental health and elderly care services, while NHS spending is predicted to fall more than \u00a320bn short of what is needed in 2020.<br></p> <p>Planned cuts for the next four years will go ahead, including a \u00a312bn welfare spending reduction. And the cuts so far have been anything but fair. A study for the Joseph Rowntree Foundation last year found that social care spending fell by \u00a365 per capita, or 14% adjusted for inflation, in the UK\u2019s most deprived communities between 2010 and 2015 and at the same time increased by \u00a328 per capita, or 8% in the least deprived communities.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"363d963801a4afad88357492910550ace993ea53\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/363d963801a4afad88357492910550ace993ea53/0_45_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Shadow chancellor John McDonnell\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shadow chancellor John McDonnell should not get his hopes up about Osborne abandoning his austerity measures.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniel Leal-Olivas/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Never mind that the International Monetary Fund has called for higher public investment spending on transport, housing and the digital infrastructure and the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development has said much the same. Under the Treasury\u2019s current plans, public spending on infrastructure is scheduled to fall sharply from 2018.</p> <p>Earlier this week the boss of the European Central Bank, Mario Draghi, made a yet another speech calling for governments to end their reliance on cheap central bank money to keep their economies afloat and start spending some of their own.</p> <p>Mark Carney made much the same point on Thursday in a speech that was mostly about his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/30/interest-rate-cut-likely-brexit-bank-of-england-mark-carney\">plans to protect the financial system from collapse</a> following the vote to leave the European Union, but found space to chide the government for not joining him by taking some action of its own to boost growth in the economy.</p> <p>Osborne is not going to pay heed. Maybe his successor will have a change of heart. It seems unlikely. A budget in the autumn in response to a threatened downturn could still happen, and that could still heap more pain on the public sector and least well off.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The prospect of interest rate cuts and a flurry of bargain-hunting by stock market investors has helped the FTSE 100 shrug off the Brexit vote to hit a 10-month high. In a strong start to the second half of 2016, the index of London-listed bluechip shares finished up 73.5 points, or 1.1%, on the day at 6,577.83. That built on solid gains clocked up over the previous three days and left the FTSE 100 up 7.2% over the week \u2013 the biggest weekly rally since late 2011, when hopes for a solution to the eurozone crisis had fired up the FTSE and other stock markets around the world. This week\u2019s rebound was a sharp contrast to just a week earlier when investors had woken up to the news Britain had voted to leave the EU. The referendum outcome last Friday caught traders off-guard after opinion polls had led them to bet on a remain vote. On the day the victory for the leave camp was confirmed, a record $2.08tn was wiped off the value of global shares. But markets quickly stabilised in the days following the vote as investors saw the low prices of some stocks as a buying opportunity and as other stocks rose in the wake of the Brexit vote. Shares in miners have been boosted by a rise in demand for precious metals, seen as a safer asset to hold in uncertain times. There were also big gains for companies that get a substantial amount of their sales from overseas thanks to a fall in the pound. The drop in sterling, which has plumbed 31-year lows since the referendum, flatters the finances of those companies that report their profits in dollars. For example, while the banking sector has generally been battered by the Brexit vote, shares in the global bank HSBC which reports in US dollars are up 3.4% since the referendum. The weaker pound has also boosted exporters because it makes their goods and services more competitive in overseas markets. The latest fillip for stock markets came from the Bank of England governor\u2019s strong hint on Thursday that interest rates could be cut within weeks and that policymakers were also ready to use other tools to shore up business and consumer confidence. Mark Carney said he believed \u201csome monetary policy easing will likely be required over the summer\u201d. In other words, official borrowing costs could be cut from their already record low of 0.5% as soon as a 14 July Bank policy meeting. The prospect of official interest rates falling as low as zero increased appetite for shares, said Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. \u201cThe stock market likes falling interest rates though, and indeed the accompanying fall in the pound, so understandably the Footsie rose on the back of Mark Carney\u2019s comments,\u201d said Khalaf. \u201cIn a world where you have to pay money to lend to the government, an investment in the stock market which pays you 3-4% a year looks attractive, even if it can be volatile.\u201d But there were doubts over whether stock markets could sustain their rally given the backdrop of political uncertainty in the UK and signs of a slowdown in the global economy that emerged long before the referendum. \u201cThe big question is if the FTSE and [other stock markets] can hold on to the momentum they have accrued in the past few days, or whether the ongoing issues in the property and banking sectors, as well as the general sense of uncertainty that seems to be everywhere but the markets at the moment, will prove to be too much,\u201d said Connor Campbell, analyst at spread-betting firm Spreadex. While the internationally diverse FTSE 100 is at a peak for this year, the more domestically focused FTSE 250 of mid-sized companies has yet to return to its pre-referendum level. Seen as a better proxy for confidence in the UK economy, that index closed at 16,565.49 on Friday, up 1.2% on the day, but down on its 17,333.51 level the night the polls closed on 23 June. Other European bourses were also struggling to regain their pre-referendum levels, with traders citing worries about the impact of Brexit on the rest of the EU, where some commentators fear a domino effect with other countries heading for the exit. Italy\u2019s main share index, weighed down by fears over some of its banking stocks, is down 9% since the referendum.",

      "bodyText": "A tumultuous week, which started with markets continuing their post-Brexit slump, has ended on a positive note as investors regained their nerve. All the leading European indices have finished the week with a positive performance, while Wall Street had also moved higher by the time London closed. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished 73.5 points or 1.13% higher at 6577.83 Germany\u2019s Dax added 0.99% to 9776.12 France\u2019s Cac climbed 0.86% to 4273.96 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB rose 0.61% to 16,295.78 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 1.29% higher at 8268.9 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.49% to 544.76 In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 36 points or 0.2% higher. On the currency markets, the pound continues to fall following the Bank of England\u2019s latest hints at interest rate cuts. It is down 0.35% at $1.326 and 0.38% down against the euro at \u20ac1.19. And on that note it\u2019s time to close for the evening and indeed the week. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back next week. The FTSE 100 has finished up 1.13% at 6577.83, to its best level since 11 August last year. Its weekly rise of 7.21% is the best since the start of December 2011. Despite an initial fall in the first two trading days after last week\u2019s shock referendum result, the leading index has been boosted by hopes of cheaper money after the Bank of England hinted at summer rate cuts, and the prospect of the process for actually leaving the EU being delayed for months. Back with Brexit, and a majority of US companies believe it will have a neglible impact. The Institute of Supply Management, which earlier released a positive update on US manufacturing, said 61% of the businesses it surveyed saw little impact compared to just 6% who thought it would have a negative effect. European banks should not automatically have to cut dividends even if they reveal capital shortfalls in this year\u2019s stress tests, according to the banking watchdog. Reuters reports: The announcement aims to help restore investor confidence in Europe\u2019s banking sector, where valuations lag those in the United States, partly due to uncertainty over capital requirements. The European Banking Authority (EBA) is coordinating a stress test of 51 lenders from across the 28-country bloc with the results due on July 29. For the first time, there will be no pass or fail mark. The EBA sought on Friday to clear up confusion over how the tests\u2019 findings will feed into broader \u201cSREP\u201d reviews of bank capital by supervisors such as the European Central Bank. The ECB supervises the eurozone\u2019s top lenders and is looking at whether banks need extra capital under a supervisory review and evaluation process, or SREP. It considers how much extra capital a bank should hold on top of its mandatory minimum requirements, and helps to formulate \u201ccapital guidance\u201d for each bank. The EBA said on Friday that this capital guidance should be set above the combined level of mandatory minimums and add-ons. However, capital guidance does not constitute any form of binding capital requirements, and therefore is not expected to trigger automatic restrictions on payouts to investors, it added. This makes clear that it is up to the supervisor to decide if dividends should be suspended. Two members of the US Federal Reserve seem to have differing views on Brexit and the US economy, however: The UK decision to leave the European Union will be a drag on US GDP, according to S&amp;P Global Ratings, but the size and diversity of the world\u2019s biggest economy will limit its exposure. The agency said: S&amp;P Global now expects U.S. real GDP to grow by 2.0% in 2016 (was 2.3% in March) and 2.4% in 2017 (was 2.5%). The risk of recession over the next 12 months is now between 20% to 25%, up from 15% to 20% in March. The Fed will now likely stay on the sidelines until the December Federal Open Markets Committee meeting then will likely raise rates by 25 basis points to a 0.5% to 0.75% range. It will gradually raise rates next year, with now only three increases expected for 2017 and three more for 2018. The Fed will likely reach its new \u201cneutral\u201d rate by 2019. \u201cAll told, we expect the repercussions from Brexit to weigh somewhat on U.S. GDP,\u201d says US chief economist Beth Ann Bovino. \u201cCombining this with lower-than-expected first quarter growth leads to the lowering of our forecast for growth this year and next.\u201d The ISM report raises the prospect of a better than expected US non-farm payrolls number, said economist Rob Carnell at ING Bank: The US Manufacturing ISM index picked up from 51.3 to 53.2 in June - consistent with a decent, but not amazing pace of manufacturing growth. As well as a good headline index, there were encouraging signs from new orders, including new export orders. 72% of manufacturing industries now report overall growth, up from 67% in May. But the real focus of this release is probably the employment index, with the US jobs report less than a week away. This index rose to 50.4, its highest since November 2015, though admittedly, manufacturing jobs make only a small contribution to the overall employment total. Nonetheless, this is a small crumb of confidence for our above-consensus 200,000 payrolls forecast (consensus 175,000) and we will be watching the non-mfg ISM employment index and ADP surveys carefully next week for further corroboration of a return to labour market strength. With markets pricing in virtually no Fed tightening in 2016 or 2017, an above consensus number could see bond yields, which have fallen heavily since Brexit, to push higher, if only for a while in these times of heightened uncertainty. Confirmation of growth in US manufacturing in June has come in the latest ISM survey. Its manufacturing activity index came in at 53.2 in June, better than the consensus forecast of 51.4 and May\u2019s figure of 51.3. This is the highest level since February 2015. But in a separate report, US construction spending dropped unexpectedly in May, the second monthly decline in a row. According to the Commerce department spending dropped by 0.8% in May, following a revised 2% fall in April. The April drop was the largest since January 2011. Economists had expected a 0.6% rise in spending after an initial 1.8% decline in April. US manufacturing moved up in June, according to the first of the day\u2019s two surveys, but the uncertainty over Brexit could dampen growth in the coming months. The final Markit manufacturing PMI index came in at 51.3, better than the expected 51.2 but lower than the initial reading of 51.4. But it was higher than May\u2019s final level of 50.7 and hit a three month high. Markit said: U.S. manufacturers indicated a slight rebound in production volumes during June, helped by the fastest rise in new work since March. However, the latest survey signalled that growth momentum remained relatively subdued in comparison to its post-crisis trend, which contributed to cautious job hiring and further efforts to reduce inventories in June. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit added: Although the manufacturing PMI ticked higher in June, the latest reading rounds off the worst quarter for goods producers for six years. The lacklustre performance of the manufacturing economy adds to signs from the flash services PMI surveys that the underlying pace of economic growth in the second quarter remained subdued Manufacturing output after a disappointing start to the year. The upturn in the employment index suggests that firms may be expecting the recent bout of weak demand to be temporary, though hiring clearly remains subdued amid fragile business confidence. Producers are struggling in the face of the strong dollar, the energy sector decline and presidential election jitters. With companies craving certainty, heightened tensions between the UK and the European Union are likely to unsettle the global business environment further in coming months, and therefore risk dampening growth in the US and export markets. The data flow in the next two months will therefore be critical to policymakers in gauging the appropriate outlook for interest rates. American markets have edged ahead in early trading, but after recent rises the rally is not convincing. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, up nearly 800 points in the past three days, has opened around 19 points or 0.1% higher ahead of the latest US manufacturing surveys, due shortly. Business organisation the CBI has called for \u201ccalm and decisive leadership, a clear plan for the UK\u2019s future outside the EU and a framework for business and the government to work together and deliver that plan are businesses\u2019 immediate priorities as the country navigates its exit from the EU.\u201d Speaking at the Evening Standard business awards, CBI director general Carolyn Fairbairn also said the government must confirm that workers from the EU who are already in the UK can stay in the country. More reaction to UK chancellor George Osborne abandoning his target to restore the public finances to surplus by 2020. Michael Izza, chief executive of chartered accountants organisation ICAEW, said: It was always going to be a struggle to meet the deficit target and in the light of the EU Referendum that job became much harder. In these uncertain times for business, it is imperative that Government devises a comprehensive strategy that minimises uncertainty and weathers any looming economic storm. Taking the global economy into account, the UK electorate knows that we still have a public finance problem as we can\u2019t continue to borrow. The challenge of the public finances remains a three-Parliament problem. Earlier the European Central Bank\u2019s chief economist Peter Praet said Brexit was a \u201cnew shock\u201d and Europe rapidly needed a roadmap on Britain\u2019s plans to leave. Speaking at a Financial Times event he said it was vital to bring clarity to the political and economic uncertainty created by the UK referendum and that an \u201corderly process\u201d was laid out for Brexit negotiations. He said red tape for firms was likely to increase as a result of the UK decision, and could weaken potential growth. He added that the challenges to the eurozone remained immense but the ECB was ready to provide liquidity. [Quotes courtesy Reuters] The pound is roughly flat against the dollar, at $1.3304, and is down 0.4% against the euro at \u20ac1.1942. Sterling has fallen almost 11% against the dollar since Britain went to the polls on 23 June to vote on EU membership. Against the euro, it is down almost 9% over the same period. The impact of the Brexit vote on the pound versus dollar: The impact of the Brexit vote on the pound versus euro: Samuel Tombs, chief economist at Pantheon Economics, makes the point that the George Osborne\u2019s target of hitting a surplus by 2020 wasn\u2019t very realistic in the first place. Even without Brexit, it was highly unlikely that the Chancellor would ever have met his goal. Last year, the structural budget deficit amounted to nearly 4% of gross domestic product. Moreover, the fiscal forecasts were based on very optimistic assumptions for the impact of fiscal tightening on growth, the likely revenues from tax avoidance measures, and the government\u2019s ability to reduce spending after six prior years of austerity. Some reaction to Osborne\u2019s speech... John McDonnell, Labour\u2019s shadow chancellor, welcomed the chancellor\u2019s decision to drop his targets: I welcome the Chancellor\u2019s decision to finally listen to the calls made by myself and Jeremy Corbyn over the last nine months to drop his failed surplus target. It is only a shame he was not realistic sooner, as under Jeremy Corbyn, Labour has been unequivocal in its opposition to failed Tory austerity. Lee Hopley, chief economist at manufacturing trade body EEF, also welcomed the move: This move will be viewed as a much-needed pick-me-up after a week of turmoil and bad news. The chancellor is right to scrap the government\u2019s hitherto relentless push on deficit reduction. The uncertainty that businesses are currently grappling with should be helped by politicians galvanising around the actions that can reasonably be taken to offer some policy stability - easing up on deficit reduction is one such measure. The Chancellor has been tweeting following his speech in Manchester, where he announced that he is abandoning his target of returning the public finances to surplus by 2020. He is stressing the \u201cflexible\u201d nature of his fiscal rules... Investors are feeling chirpier in afternoon trading. The FTSE 100 is now up 82 points or 1.3% at 6,586. The FTSE 250 - down earlier in the day - is now up 0.6% at 16,361. All major European indices are up: Germany\u2019s DAX: +0.7% at 9,745 France\u2019s CAC: +0.8% at 4,269 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: +0.4% at 16,266 Spain\u2019s IBEX: +1.4% at 8,275 Here is our story on George Osborne\u2019s comments in Manchester. Quite extraordinary stuff as he essentially admits defeat on one of the central pillars of his economic policy as chancellor. A budget surplus in 2020 is no longer realistic in a post Brexit world, he suggests. The chancellor was speaking at the Greater Manchester Chambers of Commerce. Here is what he said: Now, as the governor of the Bank of England said yesterday, the referendum result is as expected likely to lead to a significant negative shock for the British economy. How we respond will determine the impact on people\u2019s jobs and on economic growth. The Bank of England can support demand. The government must provide fiscal credibility, so we will continue to be tough on the deficit but we must be realistic about achieving a surplus by the end of this decade. This is precisely the flexibility that our rules provide for. And we need to reduce uncertainty by moving as quickly as possible to a new relationship with Europe and being super competitive, open for business and free trading. That\u2019s the plan and we must set to it. George Osborne is going to abandon his target to restore the public finances to surplus by 2020, the BBC is reporting. He has been speaking in Manchester. This is what they are reporting: Chancellor George Osborne has abandoned his target to restore government finances to a surplus by 2020, the BBC has learned. It had been the chancellor\u2019s most prized goal and had been driving austerity measures in previous budgets. However, the Chancellor said the UK must be \u201crealistic about achieving a surplus by the end of the decade\u201d. The UK economy is showing \u201cclear signs\u201d of shock in the aftermath of the vote to leave the European Union, he said. Even before that vote, there were questions over whether Mr Osborne would be able to balance the budget by 2020. Time for a market update. The FTSE 100 is holding on to gains, up 23 points, but it\u2019s a mixed bag in Europe now and the FTSE 250 is down. FTSE 100: +0.4% at 6,527 FTSE 250: -0.2% at 16,244 Germany\u2019s DAX: +0.04% at 9,684 French CAC: -0.1% at 4,235 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: -0.5% at 16,124 Spain\u2019s IBEX: +0.2% at 8,183 The Leave camp were not the biggest fans of Mark Carney in the run-up to the EU referendum. The Bank of England governor was met with hostility from some members of the camp when he warned the UK economy could fall into recession in the event of a Brexit decision. Andrea Leadsom, one of the candidates for the Tory leadership and a member of Vote Leave, accused the governor at the time of overstepping his remit. Now the vote is over, Michael Gove - a leading Brexit campaigner and a rival candidate for the Tory leadership - has been singing the governor\u2019s praises, paying tribute to Carney for stabilising the economy. Meanwhile George Osborne says there are \u201cclear signs of economic shock\u201d since Britain voted to leave the EU last week. The chancellor has been in Manchester, addressing business leaders. Sky News is reporting that EasyJet has opened talks with regulators in the EU about relocating its headquarters from the UK. The budget airline is currently based in Luton, where it employs about 1,000 people. Brexit fallout begins... Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, has a good take on the market volatility we\u2019ve seen seen Britain voted to leave the EU. European markets have started the day in a fairly positive fashion as we come to the end of what has been a turbulent and historic week. Having traded as low as 5,938 in the wake of last week\u2019s surprising Brexit vote the FTSE 100 looks on course to post its best week since 2011 as the weaker pound helped pull the index back above its pre Brexit vote highs by the middle of the week. While it is no doubt true that on a currency basis the FTSE100 is still down in euro and US dollar terms, the fact that it is one of the highest yielding blue chip benchmarks at over 4% could well be providing a pull factor in an era of ever decreasing interest rates. While the FTSE 100 is managing to hold its own the FTSE 250 is finding it a little more difficult slipping back 1% over concerns about the outlook for the UK economy over the rest of the year. James Bullard, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis, tells Bloomberg TV that Brexit shouldn\u2019t have too much of an impact on the US economy: Britain\u2019s manufacturing sector performed much better than expected in June. Activity in UK factories grew at the fastest pace in five months according to the Markit/CIPS PMI. Crucially though, the survey was conducted almost entirely before last weeks referendum on EU membership. What impact the decision to quit the EU will have on the sector - and the wider economy - remains to be seen. The headline index on the PMI - combining output, orders and employment - rose to 52.1 in June from 50.4 in May. Anything above 50 is growth territory, and economists were forecasting 49.9 - a contraction in activity. Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit: With 99% of survey responses received before the end of 23rd June, the latest PMI signalled that the manufacturing sector had started to move out of its early year sluggishness in the lead up to the UK\u2019s EU referendum. Whether this growth recovery can be sustained will depend heavily on whether the current financial and political volatility spills over to the real economy. While the Bank of England remains poised to act if needed and the UK\u2019s trading relationships are unchanged during the two-year negotiation period, there\u2019s a clear risk that ongoing uncertainty will have at least some short term impact on manufacturing during the coming quarters. The big question is whether any negative impact from uncertainty can be partly offset by a boost to exports resulting from the fall in the pound. Activity in factories in most of the eurozone\u2019s biggest economies grew in June. Both output and new orders grew at a faster pace, driving the headline index on the Markit eurozone manufacturing PMI up to 52.8 from 51.5 in May. Anything above 50 signals growth. France was the only country where the sector shrank last month - with strike action dampening activity - while manufacturing growth in Germany was the strongest in more than two years. Germany: 54.5 Austria: 54.5 Italy: 53.5 Ireland: 53 Spain: 52.2 Netherlands: 52 GreeceL 50.4 France: 48.3 Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit said it was positive news from the eurozone but issued a Brexit health warning: The data were collected prior to the UK EU referendum result, so any Brexit impact is yet to be seen in the PMI. The PMI would have likely been even higher had it not been for strikes in France, which look to have disrupted business activity in many cases. With Greece enjoying a welcome return to growth, France was the only country to see a deterioration in manufacturing conditions in June. All other countries saw faster rates of expansion except the Netherlands. Given the uncertainty caused by the prospect of Brexit, it seems likely that business and consumer spending will be adversely affected across the euro area in the short term at least, pulling growth down in coming months. Mark Carney\u2019s speech on Thursday send the yield on one UK gilt - maturing in March 2018 - negative. It was a first for the UK, with a yield of -0.04% meaning that investors were willing to pay to take on government debt - despite extreme political and economic uncertainty. Laith Khalaf, a senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said it was a \u201clandmark\u201d moment for the UK. Anyone who buys this gilt is paying the UK government for the privilege of lending it money, and this is despite the fact the ratings agencies have downgraded UK government debt in light of the Brexit vote. The UK now joins Germany, Austria, the Netherlands, Denmark, Switzerland and Japan in the club of countries where gilt yields have turned negative. The ultra-low interest rate environment paints a depressing picture of our economic prospects, though the gilt market has been so heavily tainted by central bank interference, it\u2019s hard to know how reliable an indicator it is. Such low interest rates are great for borrowers, but awful for cash savers, and for banks. Cash savers have already suffered 7 years of ultra-low interest rates, and on current expectations it looks like they will comfortably see out a decade without getting a half-decent return on their deposits. UK 10-year bonds yields: The yield on benchmark 10-year government bonds has fallen to a record low of 0.831%, putting it on course for its biggest weekly fall since November 2011. Investors often turn to bonds during times of market volatility as they are considered lower risk compared with other assets. The lower the yield, the cheaper it is for the government to borrow money. The latest snapshot of the state of the manufacturing sector across the eurozone, the UK and the US will be delivered today by the PMI surveys for June. Overnight, an official survey in China showed the manufacturing sector in the world\u2019s largest economy effectively stalled in June. Output hit a 12-month high, but all other measures showed signs of weakening. The survey is likely to add to expectations that Beijing will inject more stimulus into the economy. The pound is little changed this morning, after falling sharply on Thursday afternoon in response to Mark Carney\u2019s suggestion that more stimulus is on the way to try and counter the negative impact of the Brexit vote. It is down 0.1% against the dollar at $1.3287, and pretty much flat against the euro at \u20ac1.1980. Elsewhere in Europe, markets are seeing stronger gains: Germany\u2019s Dax: +0.8% at 9,753 France\u2019s CAC: +0.7% at 4,266 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: +1.1% at 16,383 Spain\u2019s IBEX: +1.1% at 8,256 Investors are once again shaking off Brexit concerns with shares rising modestly. In the UK, FTSE 100 is up 4 points or 0.1% at 6,506. The FTSE 250 is up 0.3% at 16,321. As it stands, the FTSE is on course to post its biggest weekly gain since December 2011. Good morning. This time last week Britain was waking up to the news that it had voted to leave the European Union. The outcome sent shockwaves through global markets, with shares plunging last Friday. But markets have since bounced back, with the FTSE 100 yesterday hitting its highest level since August. Investors around the world were cheered by the reassuring words of Mark Carney, Bank of England governor, who indicated the central bank stood ready to pump fresh stimulus into the UK economy as the impact of Brexit weighs on growth and confidence. Our story on Carney\u2019s speech is here: Economists believe the Bank might act in August, to coincide with its quarterly inflation report which includes updated economic forecasts. Options on the table include cutting interest rates to zero from 0.5%, as well as more quantitative easing. Markets around the world liked the message, with Wall Street closing up and shares rising in Asia. The Hang Seng rose 1.75% to 20,794.37, while the Nikkei rose 0.7% at 15,6825.48. European markets have just opened higher.",

      "bodyText": "George Osborne has in effect abandoned the linchpin of his economic strategy \u2013 to return the government finances to a surplus by 2020 \u2013 following the Brexit vote. The chancellor, who campaigned to remain in the EU, said there were already \u201cclear signs\u201d of shock in the economy a week after the referendum result wrongfooted the market, sending the pound to more than 30-year lows and costing the UK its last AAA credit rating. His admission that he would have to push back his key goal for getting the public finances back in the black was seized upon by Labour as evidence of \u201cfailed Tory austerity\u201d. Speaking a day after the governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, hinted at an imminent interest rate cut to shore up the economy, Osborne spelled out the government\u2019s role in keeping money flowing following the EU referendum result. Addressing the Greater Manchester Chambers of Commerce, Osborne said: \u201cThe referendum result is as expected likely to lead to a significant negative shock for the British economy. How we respond will determine the impact on people\u2019s jobs and on economic growth. The Bank of England can support demand. \u201cThe government must provide fiscal credibility, so we will continue to be tough on the deficit, but we must be realistic about achieving a surplus by the end of this decade. This is precisely the flexibility that our rules provide for.\u201d That marked a turnaround from the chancellor\u2019s pre-referendum warning on the campaign trail that a vote for Brexit would force him to call an emergency budget, with increases in income tax, alcohol and petrol duties, and cuts to the NHS, schools and defence. After the vote to leave the EU, against the backdrop of weakening business and consumer confidence, and volatile financial markets, Osborne ruled out an emergency budget. The chancellor\u2019s latest announcement was not entirely unexpected, given that his fiscal rules allow for more wriggle room in exceptional times. The intervention was welcomed by business groups as a small piece of certainty at a time of political crisis in the UK. Carney addressed that spike in economic and political uncertainty head on this week when he warned that the economy was suffering from \u201ceconomic post-traumatic stress disorder\u201d. The Bank\u2019s governor prompted a stock market rally after indicating that cuts to interest rates, which are already at a historic low of 0.5%, were on the cards. Achieving a budget surplus by the end of the decade and every year thereafter \u201cin normal times\u201d was one of Osborne\u2019s most coveted economic goals. It had conjured images of Mr Micawber, a character in Charles Dickens\u2019s David Copperfield. Governments were expected to at least balance the books in the 19th century and in the first three decades of the 20th century, when the public finances were run on the Mr Micawber principle that income exceeding spending equalled happiness, and spending exceeding income equalled misery. Osborne\u2019s admission that he needed to be \u201crealistic\u201d about achieving it follows a warning in March that he had only a 50-50 chance of achieving his aim of a \u00a310bn surplus in four years\u2019 time. The warning came from the Institute for Fiscal Studies following the budget, in which Osborne was already facing a deterioration in growth forecasts. Slower growth makes it harder to improve the public finances because tax receipts wane. The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, said there had been \u201cno credible economists that could be found to support the chancellor\u2019s surplus target in the first place\u201d. \u201cIt is only a shame he was not realistic sooner, as under Jeremy Corbyn, Labour has been unequivocal in its opposition to failed Tory austerity,\u201d said McDonnell. \u201cThe truth is [that] as Labour consistently warned, George Osborne\u2019s recovery built on sand was underpinned by a fiscal rule that is not robust or flexible enough to equip our economy for any potential shocks it may face, or to provide the investment that our economy so clearly needs.\u201d Andrew Tyrie MP, the chairman of the Treasury committee, described the abandoned fiscal rule as \u201cthe latest in a long line of fiscal rules, targets and objectives of successive governments to have bitten the dust\u201d. Manufacturers\u2019 organisation the EEF welcomed the \u201cmuch-needed pick-me-up\u201d and called for the government to combat any economic downturn by committing to infrastructure expenditure. Rain Newton-Smith, the chief economist at the CBI business lobby group, said the chancellor was right to adapt his budget policy to the state of the economy, but that it should still keep a long-term goal for a surplus. \u201cOnce the economy has adjusted, the government should set out plans to return the public finances to balance over the economic cycle,\u201d Newton-Smith said. The Resolution Foundation thinktank called for a rethink of the \u00a312bn cuts to working-age welfare scheduled to take place during this parliament.",

      "bodyText": "EasyJet has applied to a number of European countries for authorisation to fly throughout Europe following the UK\u2019s vote for Brexit, but the airline said it had no plans to move its headquarters from Britain. The budget carrier said it has had talks with regulators outside the UK about gaining an air operator certificate (AOC). If Britain lost access to the European aviation market, an AOC from another EU country would let easyJet continue to fly across Europe while its UK certificate would enable it to fly domestic routes. If the UK secures access to the single market in talks then easyJet\u2019s position would be unchanged. EasyJet said it was planning for all outcomes following last week\u2019s Brexit vote and that it would not decide what to do until Britain\u2019s relationship with the EU was cleared up. It already has a Swiss AOC as well as a British one, as Switzerland is not in the EU. To gain an AOC would require easyJet to post a handful of employees at most in the country in question, a spokesman said. Whatever it decides to do, easyJet\u2019s head office and about 1,000 employees there would remain at Luton airport, the spokesman added. Carolyn McCall, easyJet\u2019s chief executive, has told other business leaders it is almost inevitable that the company will move its headquarters, Sky News reported. But the spokesman said such a move would be a technical matter that would not affect day\u2013to\u2013day operations. The company said: \u201cAs part of easyJet\u2019s contingency planning before the referendum we had informal discussions with a number of European aviation regulators about the establishment of an AOC in a European country to enable easyJet to fly across Europe as we do today. \u201cEasyJet has now started a formal process to acquire an AOC. We have no plans to move from Luton \u2013 our home for 20 years.\u201d The company\u2019s shares have fallen sharply this week after easyJet warned on Monday that consumer caution following the Brexit vote was likely to add to existing problems such as cancelled flights and concern about terrorist attacks. EasyJet said it was lobbying the EU and the UK to keep access to the free market.",

Whatever it decides to do, easyJet\u2019s head office and about 1,000 employees there would remain at Luton airport, the spokesman added.</p> <p>Carolyn McCall, easyJet\u2019s chief executive, has told other business leaders it is almost inevitable that the company will move its headquarters, <a href=\"http://news.sky.com/story/1720169/easyjet-opens-talks-over-post-brexit-hq-move\">Sky News reported</a>. But the spokesman said such a move would be a technical matter that would not affect day\u2013to\u2013day operations.</p> <p>The company said: \u201cAs part of easyJet\u2019s contingency planning before the referendum we had informal discussions with a number of European aviation regulators about the establishment of an AOC in a European country to enable easyJet to fly across Europe as we do today. </p> <p>\u201cEasyJet has now started a formal process to acquire an AOC. We have no plans to move from Luton \u2013 our home for 20 years.\u201d</p> <p>The company\u2019s shares have fallen sharply this week after easyJet <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/27/foxtons-and-easyjet-issue-profits-warnings-eu-referendum\">warned on Monday</a> that consumer caution following the Brexit vote was likely to add to existing problems such as cancelled flights and concern about terrorist attacks. </p> <p>EasyJet said it was lobbying the EU and the UK to keep access to the free market.</p>",

      "bodyText": "When Samya Moftah walked into the Macy\u2019s flagship New York store looking for gifts for her family last summer, she did not expect to be locked in a basement cell and charged with multiple crimes. Nor did the department store, already blighted by allegations of racism, expect to have another lawsuit on its hands. Moftah, 53, was carrying two bags \u2013 one from JC Penney, and the second from a previous Macy\u2019s shopping trip. Her plan was to exchange clothes from a couple of weeks prior for different sizes. After finding clothes for her daughter, she went to a register to buy and exchange the other items. On the way out, a Macy\u2019s Herald Square manager pulled Moftah aside by the arm, and told her that she needed to accompany her to an office, and that she had shoplifted, according to an affidavit provided by Moftah\u2019s attorneys from the Usar Law Group. She thought she would show the manager her receipts and be on her way, and followed her into an elevator with her purchases. Two plainclothes security officers joined them on another floor. In the basement of Macy\u2019s they led her to a row of \u201cwhat looked like jail cells\u201d. Moftah\u2019s purse and phone were taken, and she was patted down under her shirt, legs, private areas as she repeatedly asked what was happening. According to the affidavit, one of the employees said, \u201csee what\u2019s under the scarf\u201d in referral to her hijab. She repeatedly mentioned that there was a huge mistake, and they should check her receipts. Moftah was locked in one of the cells. Her things were reviewed in front of her, and she \u201ccontinued to plead with her (the manager), telling her \u201cthese were mine, and I had purchased them on my Macy\u2019s card,\u201d and she could easily verify this. The manager approached her with documents, and told her to sign them repeatedly and pay $100 in order to go home. Moftah hadn\u2019t eaten all day \u2013 it was Ramadan. When she began to cry, she was threatened with handcuffs and taunted for stealing during Ramadan and being Muslim, according to her affidavit. The Macy\u2019s manager returned and told her the new price to go home would be $500. When she refused to do so, her credit card was removed from her wallet and charged for the full amount. The police arrived and as she asked for help, they arrested her. Moftah was released at midnight, and charged with petit larceny and criminal possession of stolen property in the fifth degree. After several court appearances, the court dismissed the criminal charges against Moftah on 16 March 2016. Humiliated, she found out about a lawsuit filed by another woman with an almost identical story and joined in a class action against Macy\u2019s. Cinthia Carolina Reyes Orellana was similarly detained on 18 July 2014. Criminal charges against Orellana were also dropped months after she was accused of shoplifting $59 worth of clothes after she moved from one floor to another, which is allegedly not allowed in Macy\u2019s stores. Orellana was similarly not allowed to return home and was given a receipt with a charge of $100 and told she needed to pay a full $289 to Macy\u2019s. She was also turned over to the NYPD after several hours locked in the basement of Macy\u2019s in a cell. In letters and receipts shown to the Guardian, Macy\u2019s continued to send Orellana settlement claims for $199.80 for the civil claim through law firm Palmer, Reifler, and Associates in September 2014. A Manhattan court judge ruled in favor of a class action lawsuit against Macy\u2019s on Monday, in a case that looks into New York\u2019s general business and obligations laws. The business law statute states: \u201cA retail establishment for the purpose of investigation or questioning ... as to the ownership of any merchandise ... shall be in defense to such action that the person is detained in a reasonable manner.\u201d The second statute gives retailers further power: \u201cAn adult shall be civilly liable to the operator of the establishment.\u201d Penalties cannot exceed $500, and the retailer can charge five times the amount of the stolen merchandise. The laws are meant to shield retailers. The opinion from Judge Manuel Mendez states: \u201cMacy\u2019s has combined the power it was given under the statutes by using this power as a double-edged sword instead of a shield.\u201d He reasoned further that there is no language in the statures that allows Macy\u2019s to detain an individual once an internal investigation is complete. The actions the class action alleged were seen as a violation of due process. Faruk Usar of Usar Law Group, who represents Reyes and Moftah, said: \u201cWe\u2019re just starting. There will be discovery to see how many people have gone through this experience. We are seeking all the money Macy\u2019s collected to be returned.\u201d The court enjoined Macy\u2019s from \u201cdemanding, requesting, collecting, receiving, or accepting any payments\u201d that connect with the statutes from suspected shoplifters while detained in Macy\u2019s custody. Jim Sluzewski, senior vice-president of corporate communications and external affairs at Macy\u2019s, said that the practice of civil recovery ended in fall 2015. \u201cThe preliminary injunction relates to in-store civil recovery, a practice that Macy\u2019s had previously discontinued nationwide. Given that this is a matter in active litigation, we do not have further comment to make,\u201d he replied in a statement. Macy\u2019s attorneys from Palmer, Reifler and Associates PA did not reply for comment. For Macy\u2019s, this is the latest in a series of problematic arrests in its New York store. In 2014 the retailer paid New York attorney general Eric Schneiderman $650,000 to settle more than a dozen complaints of profiling and false detentions of minority customers at its Herald Square store. Usar said: \u201cWe are claiming is that this is all by design. To accuse someone, hold them, charge them money, and then transfer them to the criminal justice system. Orellana and Moftah went to the court to prove their innocence. It\u2019s like the police pulling you over, giving you a ticket and demanding money on the spot. If not worse.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "British Gas is offering free daytime electricity for one day each weekend to more than 2 million customers in what the UK\u2019s biggest energy supplier says is the first deal of its kind. Customers with smart meters will pay nothing for electricity between 9am and 5pm on either Saturday or Sunday, and British Gas\u2019s standard rate at other times. British Gas has 2.4 million smart-meter users out of about 11 million residential customers. British Gas said the FreeTime tariff would be its cheapest dual-fuel deal and give customers more control over when and how they consume energy. The tariff, the first to offer smart-meter customers free electricity, will be fixed until March 2018 but analysts said there were cheaper deals on the market. Customers taking part in trials of the plan have reported changing their behaviour to save an average of \u00a360 a year, British Gas said. Those customers moved some of their energy consumption to the free period, which made up 11% of the average customer\u2019s usage. Sarwjit Sambhi, British Gas\u2019s managing director of UK home, said: \u201cFreeTime is an industry first and will give our customers greater control of their energy use. This will be the first of many smart-meter innovations from British Gas which will also contribute to managing the country\u2019s demand for power from the national grid.\u201d Tom Lyon, an energy specialist at uSwitch.com, said the offer was an example of more innovative deals from suppliers since the energy regulator gave operators more flexibility on tariffs. But he said: \u201cBritish Gas\u2019s HomeEnergy FreeTime deal is, on average, \u00a3250 a year more expensive than the cheapest deal on the market, so customers should always shop around.\u201d Smart meters allow customers to keep up with how much energy they use and track what it is costing them on a monitor. They do away with meter readings and are meant to give people an incentive to save energy and money. Stephen Murray, an energy expert at MoneySuperMarket.com, said there were potential savings for customers who took up the deal but that shopping around to one of the best fixed-rate deals would probably save more money. He said: \u201cThe concept of free weekend electricity for customers with smart meters is a positive move by British Gas, but the smart meter rollout is still in its early stages, with functionality across suppliers still creating challenges.\u201d The 2.75m smart meters installed in British homes make up 5.8% of all domestic meters operated by large energy suppliers, government figures show (pdf). The big suppliers installed more than 540,000 meters in the first three months of this year. The government wants all of the UK\u2019s more than 26m homes to have a smart meter by 2020 and has required suppliers to offer one of the meters to all their customers. The push is part of the government\u2019s plan to upgrade Britain\u2019s ageing energy system and reduce energy use.",

      "bodyText": "Leading shares are heading for their best week since December 2011, but banks continue to miss out on the post-Brexit bounce. Concerns about a UK recession and comments from Bank of England governor Mark Carney hinting at a possible interest rate cut in the summer have revived worries about the outlook for the banking sector. So Royal Bank of Scotland is down 5.5p at 166.1p and Barclays is 2.95p down at 135.65p. Housebuilders, another sector which has yet to really benefit from the market\u2019s revival, are turning in a mixed performance. Barratt Developments has lost 5.4p to 400p but Persimmon has put on 9p to \u00a314.56. Mining shares are also under pressure, after weaker than expected Chinese manufacturing figures for June renewing concerns about the outlook for the world\u2019s second largest economy. BHP Billiton is down 20.3p to 922.5p while Antofagasta has fallen 8.1p to 457.5p. But precious metal miners continue to benefit from the search for safe investments, with Fresnillo up 70p at \u00a317.14 and Randgold Resources rising 235p to \u00a386.45. Overall the FTSE 100 has added another 19.55 points to 6523.88, its highest level since August. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: European markets have started the day in a fairly positive fashion as we come to the end of what has been a turbulent and historic week. Having traded as low as 5,938 in the wake of last week\u2019s surprising Brexit vote the FTSE100 looks on course to post its best week since 2011 as the weaker pound helped pull the index back above its pre Brexit vote highs by the middle of the week. While it is no doubt true that on a currency basis the FTSE100 is still down in euro and US dollar terms, the fact that it is one of the highest yielding blue chip benchmarks at over 4% could well be providing a pull factor in an era of ever decreasing interest rates. Among the mid-caps animal genetics firm Genus has jumped 105p to \u00a316.70 after analysts at Liberum moved from hold to buy and raised its target price from \u00a315 to \u00a317.50. They said: The shares have not been immune from Brexit but Genus\u2019s business should be fairly immune. Only around 10% sales are generated in the UK and weaker sterling should a drive at least a 7% translation boost to profits which is reflected in our forecasts. [There are] three new technologies which we think will transform Genus\u2019s growth (Sexed semen, IVF in cattle and Gene editing). Finally, we believe current trading is solid with robust US and China hog markets offsetting weaker conditions in Latin America and, especially, dairy. Transport group Stagecoach - which reported results this week - is down 23.1p at 208p after JP Morgan cut its rating from neutral to underweight in the wake of the Brexit vote, citing weaker sterling and lower UK economic growth.",

      "bodyText": "UK factory output made tentative gains in June after a slump in the spring, but firms still shed jobs amid fears over the referendum vote last week. The survey of manufacturers, which was mostly conducted ahead of the decision to quit the EU, found that most of the gains came from solid growth in new orders, which rose at the fastest pace since last October. The Markit/CIPS purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) increased to 52.1, from a revised reading of 50.4 in May, its highest level since January. Rob Dobson, senior economist at survey compilers Markit, said the rise in new orders reflected the continuing strength of domestic business with a little support from the export sector, which remained tough. He said: \u201cWith 99% of survey responses received before the end of 23 June, the latest PMI signalled that the manufacturing sector has started to move out of its early year sluggishness in the lead-up to the UK\u2019s EU referendum.\u201d The PMI also rose to a five-month high on the back of improved rates of expansion in production and a demand for capital goods, which Dobson said was a key bellwether of broader investment spending. However, he warned that manufacturers, who have yet to regain the level of output before the 2008 crash, remained wary of economic and political developments. \u201cWhether this growth recovery can be sustained will depend heavily on whether the current financial and political volatility spills over to the real economy. \u201cWhile the Bank of England remains poised to act if needed and the UK\u2019s trading relationships are unchanged during the two-year negotiation period, there\u2019s a clear risk that ongoing uncertainty will have at least some short-term impact on manufacturing during the coming quarters,\u201d he said. \u201cThe big question is whether any negative impact from uncertainty can be partly offset by a boost to exports resulting from the fall in the pound.\u201d Surveys of eurozone manufacturers by Markit found that only France continued to struggle as the other 18 members of the currency bloc moved ahead, including Greece. Markit said: \u201cThe recovery in the eurozone manufacturing sector gathered momentum in June. Growth of both production and new orders accelerated to the fastest in the year so far, taking the respective rates of expansion during the second quarter as a whole a tick above those achieved in quarter one.\u201d The eurozone PMI posted a six-month high of 52.8 in June, up from 51.5 in May and above the earlier flash estimate of 52.6. \u201cGrowth was led by a resurgent Germany and Austria, where the rates of expansion accelerated to the fastest since February 2014 and May 2011 respectively,\u201d Markit said. \u201cUpturns in Italy, Spain and Ireland also gathered pace, but slowed in the Netherlands. The Greek PMI moved back into expansion territory for the first time in six months, posting a 25-month peak of 50.4. The only nation to signal contraction was France.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "What kind of economy will the next government inherit? The economy feels sluggish because it is still transitioning from mining investment-led growth. The prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, and the opposition leader, Bill Shorten, have offered voters competing visions on how to speed up the process but neither has much urgency. The centrepiece of Turnbull\u2019s budget \u2013 his $48bn 10-year tax cut plan \u2013 will be fully implemented by 2026-27, so its total effect won\u2019t be felt until 2046. Shorten says he would rather fuel growth by spending heavily on health and education. But the benefits of his plan, measured by economic growth, will take as long as Turnbull\u2019s. The economy won\u2019t be getting much from government policy in the next few years, whoever wins. How will things improve? On Thursday Australia completed its 25th year of uninterrupted economic growth. For 25 years the economy grew at an average annual rate of about 3.25%. Over the past 12 months, it has grown by 3.1%, so economic activity is running close to the long-term average. Sound believable? It is. In fact it is higher than Treasury\u2019s estimate of Australia\u2019s potential growth rate, which is about 2.75%. That has helped the trend unemployment rate to fall from 6.2% to 5.7% since March last year. One reason is that non-mining sector jobs are more labour-intensive, and non-mining jobs are picking up. The economist Saul Eslake says: \u201cIt makes sense that the rotation in growth away from mining, which is the least labour-intensive form of activity known to mankind, to growth led by dwelling construction and by household and business services, which are fairly labour-intensive, will create more jobs for a given amount of GDP. . \u201cThat all makes sense. And we\u2019re now having record levels of dwelling construction, with over 200,000 new dwellings last year, and that\u2019s labour-intensive. Likewise, we know there\u2019s a strong upswing in tourism, which is also labour-intensive.\u201d The chief economist of the Commonwealth Bank, Michael Blythe, says the economy is further through the transition than people realise. He says the big miners are about 80% of the way through their downturn in capital expenditure, and about 60% of the way through the associated job losses \u2013 and those resources are definitely being diverted to non-mining parts of the economy. So why do things feel so sluggish? Because wages have not kept pace with economic growth. We are being paid less for the work we\u2019re doing. \u201cWe\u2019ve had three or four years now of falling commodity prices,\u201d Blythe says. \u201cIt explains why income growth in Australia is running at recession-type levels. \u201cSo despite those fantastic outcomes in the real economy, our income looks more like what you\u2019d expect to see during a recession. And that brings with it a number of risks for the Australian economy in the year ahead.\u201d What about the budget? One of the risks in such an environment, where incomes and government revenue are so weak, is that the government will have to cut spending if it wants to wind back the deficit quickly. \u201cThat comes with a negative impact on growth,\u201d says Blythe. And companies facing weak profits that want to boost their bottom line may want to focus on costs. That means putting off capital spending and deferring labour hiring. That will have a negative impact too. Economists say the commonwealth budget is in a much less secure position than it was in 2007. Both Labor and the Coalition say their policies will return the budget to surplus by 2020-21. But they are relying on a Treasury assumption that nominal income growth will revert to 5% within two years, boosting revenue and dragging the budget into the black. It\u2019s an artificial assumption. \u201cIt\u2019s not based on anything other than convention,\u201d says a former Reserve Bank board member, Warwick McKibbin. The next government will not have much fiscal space to work with.",

One reason is that non-mining sector jobs are more labour-intensive, and non-mining jobs are picking up. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/01/the-guardian-view-on-the-australian-election-big-ideas-shrink-in-a-small-target-campaign\">The Guardian view on the Australian election: big ideas shrink in a small-target campaign</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The economist Saul Eslake says: \u201cIt makes sense that the rotation in growth away from mining, which is the least labour-intensive form of activity known to mankind, to growth led by dwelling construction and by household and business services, which are fairly labour-intensive, will create more jobs for a given amount of GDP. .</p> <p>\u201cThat all makes sense. And we\u2019re now having record levels of dwelling construction, with over 200,000 new dwellings last year, and that\u2019s labour-intensive. Likewise, we know there\u2019s a strong upswing in tourism, which is also labour-intensive.\u201d</p> <p>The chief economist of the Commonwealth Bank, Michael Blythe, says the economy is further through the transition than people realise. He says the big miners are about 80% of the way through their downturn in capital expenditure, and about 60% of the way through the associated job losses \u2013 and those resources are definitely being diverted to non-mining parts of the economy.</p> <p>So why do things feel so sluggish? Because wages have not kept pace with economic growth. We are being paid less for the work we\u2019re doing.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve had three or four years now of falling commodity prices,\u201d Blythe says. \u201cIt explains why income growth in Australia is running at recession-type levels.</p> <p>\u201cSo despite those fantastic outcomes in the real economy, our income looks more like what you\u2019d expect to see during a recession. And that brings with it a number of risks for the Australian economy in the year ahead.\u201d</p> <h2>What about the budget?</h2> <p>One of the risks in such an environment, where incomes and government revenue are so weak, is that the government will have to cut spending if it wants to wind back the deficit quickly.</p> <p>\u201cThat comes with a negative impact on growth,\u201d says Blythe.</p> <p>And companies facing weak profits that want to boost their bottom line may want to focus on costs. That means putting off capital spending and deferring labour hiring. That will have a negative impact too.</p> <p>Economists say the commonwealth budget is in a much less secure position than it was in 2007.<br></p> <p>Both Labor and the Coalition say their policies will return the budget to surplus by 2020-21.</p> <p>But they are relying on a Treasury assumption that nominal income growth will revert to 5% within two years, boosting revenue and dragging the budget into the black. It\u2019s an artificial assumption.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not based on anything other than convention,\u201d says a former Reserve Bank board member, Warwick McKibbin.</p> <p>The next government will not have much fiscal space to work with.</p>",
