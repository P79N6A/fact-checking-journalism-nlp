      "bodyText": "MPs have attacked the former Barclays boss Bob Diamond for being \"highly selective\" in the evidence he gave to their emergency hearings on rigging key Libor interest rates, in the first comprehensive report on the way bankers and regulators handled the scandal. The Treasury select committee also criticised the Bank of England and the chief City regulator for being slow to notice the events that led to the \u00a3290m fine for Barclays in June. \"It doesn't look good,\" said Andrew Tyrie, the Conservative MP who chairs the committee, pointing out that neither spotted the problems with Libor. Speaking about Diamond's appearance before the committee last month, he said: \"Select committees are entitled to expect candour and frankness from witnesses before them.

In response, Diamond made a strong defence of his 16-year tenure at the bank, arguing that Barclays had not needed a taxpayer bailout. He insisted he had answered \"truthfully, candidly and based on information available to me\" and that the image being created of Barclays \"could not be further from the truth\".

Urgent improvements, both to the way banks are run and the way they are regulated, [are] needed if public and market confidence is to be restored,\" he said. The MPs took evidence from Diamond barely 48 hours after he resigned as chief executive of Barclays, and were frustrated by his refusal to acknowledge that the City regulator, the Financial Services Authority, had expressed concerns about the culture of the bank to the Barclays board in the runup to the Libor fine. But the committee's 122-page report entitled \"fixing Libor: some preliminary findings\" also shows that the MPs believe the FSA and the Bank of England took the steps that led to Diamond's departure only after digesting public and media reaction to the Libor fine. \"Regulators should not decide the composition of boards in response to headlines. Many will agree with the removal of Mr Diamond. However, many will wonder why the regulators did not intervene earlier, for example, at the time of the publication of the [fine],\" Tyrie said. The committee describes the Libor fine \u2013 the first of many expected to be imposed on big financial firms \u2013 as a \"reputational disaster for Barclays\". It forced the chairman, Marcus Agius, to quit, only to be reinstated 24 hours later after Sir Mervyn King, governor of the Bank of England, told him that regulators had lost confidence in Diamond. Correspondence published for the first time today between Agius and Tyrie appears to support Diamond's evidence to the committee, as Agius admits that Diamond had not seen some of the documents in advance when he was asked about them last month. The committee said the Barclays fine should be seen in the context that other banks were being investigated for rigging the rate and that investigations should be accelerated, particularly at banks owned by taxpayers \u2013 a possible reference to Royal Bank of Scotland. Diamond's appearance before MPs was followed by those of Agius and Jerry del Missier, the top Barclays banker who quit after issuing an instruction to cut the bank's Libor submissions in October 2008, as well as those of King and his deputy, Paul Tucker. The hearings also put candidates to replace King as Bank of England governor next year on the back foot, as Tucker and Lord Turner, chairman of the FSA, were forced to defend their actions during the period. The MPs said one question the inquiry became focused on may have been a \"smokescreen\" to distract from more serious issues underlying the scandal.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "In one of the quietest weeks for trading this decade, the Olympics ending, the march of eurozone uncertainty continuing, along with the usual summer holiday exodus, left the FTSE 100 ending the week pretty much where it started. The market opened on Monday at 5844 points and closed at 5852 on Friday afternoon as it seemed like no news was good news. A slow building of optimism that eurozone members were hatching a plan to save the region did help the FTSE touch a four and a half-month high with European markets up and Spanish and Italian 10-year bond yields at lower levels than in recent weeks. In the US, decisions were being made on Standard Chartered's banking future there, with New York state's general attorney's office deciding to let the bank keep its licence despite declaring it a \"rogue institution\". The City dislikes uncertainty, so the announcement that a \u00a3220m settlement had been reached helped the bank's shares close the week at \u00a314.25, up on the \u00a312.29 low but well off the \u00a316.00 where they were trading before the allegations were made. Stories about Royal Bank of Scotland, Lloyds Banking Group, Barclays and HSBC all being subpoenaed in two different US states over Libor were shrugged off. All four banks closed higher on the week. HSBC was up 2.4p at 567.3p, RBS was up 11.7p at 231p, while Lloyds and Barclays jostled for Friday's biggest riser, both closing up 1.2p and 6.7p respectively on the day and 2.6p and 7.4p on the week. Lloyds closed at 33.9p and Barclays at 191.3p. By comparison, Spain's banks continue to feel the pain as bad loans rose to 9.42% of their outstanding portfolios in June \u2013 the highest level on record. Bank of Spain data showed bad loans had risen from 8.95% in May. Loans that fell into arrears climbed by \u20ac8.4bn (\u00a36.6bn) from May to \u20ac164.4bn in June. BP's revelation that it had sold its Carson oil refinery and related assets in California for $2.5bn (\u00a31.6bn) to rival US refinery firm Tesoro was the company's latest move to reshape its US business, which has taken a battering since the Deepwater Horizon disaster. The shares gained 3.1p on Friday, ending at 454p. And while BP managed to see through the sale of its assets, rumours of a United Utilities takeover by a consortium of Ontario teachers, Qatar's investment vehicle and Abu Dhabi on Monday quickly turned to nothing and a rise to 816p was reversed. The shares ended at 725.5p. Train company FirstGroup caused a stir after snatching the west coast mainline franchise from Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Trains as analysts debated whether it had overpaid. The early consensus was the \u00a35.5bn price tag was on the high side, and shares fell 6%, but recovered some ground, closing at 248.7p. John Lawson, an analyst at Investec, explained: \"The debate is likely to rage for some time as to whether FirstGroup has overbid or not for the InterCity West Coast rail franchise (and the truth is not likely to emerge for many years).\" Meanwhile, platinum mining company Lonmin's shares collapsed amid violence and shootings \u2013 problems that even its former boss, Tiny Rowland, under its previous name Lonrho, would have struggled to escape. As South Africa mourns the massacre of 34 mine workers, the company said it will miss targets, is monitoring its banking covenants closely, and its chief executive Ian Farmer has stepped down temporarily after being diagnosed with a serious illness.",

      "body": "<p>In one of the quietest weeks for trading this decade, the Olympics ending, the march of eurozone uncertainty continuing, along with the usual summer holiday exodus, left the FTSE 100 ending the week pretty much where it started.</p> <p>The market opened on Monday at 5844 points and closed at 5852 on Friday afternoon as it seemed like no news was good news.</p> <p>A slow building of optimism that eurozone members were hatching a plan to save the region did help the FTSE touch a four and a half-month high with European markets up and Spanish and Italian 10-year bond yields at lower levels than in recent weeks.</p> <p>In the US, decisions were being made on <strong>Standard Chartered</strong>'s<strong> </strong>banking future there, with New York state's general attorney's office deciding to let the bank keep its licence despite declaring it a \"rogue institution\".</p> <p>The City dislikes uncertainty, so the announcement that a \u00a3220m settlement had been reached helped the bank's shares close the week at \u00a314.25, up on the \u00a312.29 low but well off the \u00a316.00 where they were trading before the allegations were made.</p> <p>Stories about Royal Bank of Scotland, Lloyds Banking Group, Barclays and HSBC all being subpoenaed in two different US states over Libor were shrugged off. All four banks closed higher on the week. <strong>HSBC</strong> was up 2.4p at 567.3p, <strong>RBS</strong> was up 11.7p at 231p, while <strong>Lloyds</strong> and <strong>Barclays</strong> jostled for Friday's biggest riser, both closing up 1.2p and 6.7p respectively on the day and 2.6p and 7.4p on the week. Lloyds closed at 33.9p and Barclays at 191.3p.</p> <p>By comparison, Spain's banks continue to feel the pain as bad loans rose to 9.42% of their outstanding portfolios in June \u2013 the highest level on record. Bank of Spain data showed bad loans had risen from 8.95% in May. Loans that fell into arrears climbed by \u20ac8.4bn (\u00a36.6bn) from May to \u20ac164.4bn in June.</p> <p><strong>BP</strong>'s revelation that it had sold its Carson oil refinery and related assets in California for $2.5bn (\u00a31.6bn) to rival US refinery firm Tesoro was the company's latest move to reshape its US business, which has taken a battering since the Deepwater Horizon disaster. The shares gained 3.1p on Friday, ending at 454p.</p> <p>And while BP managed to see through the sale of its assets, rumours of a <strong>United Utilities</strong> takeover by a consortium of Ontario teachers, Qatar's investment vehicle and Abu Dhabi on Monday quickly turned to nothing and a rise to 816p was reversed. The shares ended at 725.5p.</p> <p>Train company <strong>FirstGroup</strong> caused a stir after snatching the west coast mainline franchise from Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Trains as analysts debated whether it had overpaid. The early consensus was the \u00a35.5bn price tag was on the high side, and shares fell 6%, but recovered some ground, closing at 248.7p.</p> <p>John Lawson, an analyst at Investec, explained: \"The debate is likely to rage for some time as to whether FirstGroup has overbid or not for the InterCity West Coast rail franchise (and the truth is not likely to emerge for many years).\"</p> <p>Meanwhile, platinum mining company <strong>Lonmin</strong>'s shares collapsed amid violence and shootings \u2013 problems that even its former boss, Tiny Rowland, under its previous name Lonrho, would have struggled to escape.</p> <p>As South Africa mourns the massacre of 34 mine workers, the company said it will miss targets, is monitoring its banking covenants closely, and its chief executive Ian Farmer has stepped down temporarily after being diagnosed with a serious illness.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Success stories are thin on the ground in Spain these days but Inditex, the retail clothing giant that includes Zara, appears immune to the slings and arrows of misfortune. Last week its founder, Amancio Ortega, was named by Bloomberg as the <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-08-07/ortega-passes-buffett-as-world-s-third-richest-person-video-.html\" title=\"\">third richest man</a> in the world, with a personal fortune of \u20ac37.5bn (\u00a329.4bn). The company, the world's biggest clothing retailer, has tripled its stock market value over the past three years with profits up 30% on 2011 for the first quarter of this year.</p> <p>Even in Spain, where consumer spending has nosedived as a result of spending cuts and mass unemployment, Inditex has increased sales by a modest 1%, while competitors such as Mango saw profits fall by 38.5% in 2011, despite increased worldwide sales.</p> <p>The extraordinary thing about Inditex being a global leader is not just that it's Spanish, but that it's a success story that began and remains headquartered in Galicia in Spain's wild, windswept north-west. It is one of Spain's poorest regions and has always had high emigration. At election time politicians have to go on the stump in Buenos Aires and Mexico City, because expats account for as much as 30% of the vote in some Galician constituencies. In short, Galicia is not a place you establish a global empire, but that's what Ortega has done.</p> <p>Galicians are famously enigmatic and, although he was raised in Le\u00f3n and moved to Galicia as a teenager, Ortega is an enigma, the personification of the reclusive billionaire. He never gives interviews and is rarely photographed. Pablo Isla, the chief executive appointed mid-crisis in 2011 when Ortega stepped down, doesn't give interviews either.</p> <p>The key to business success in Spain, where many of the most successful companies are family concerns, is often to be <em>de buena familia</em> but Ortega's origins are of the humblest. His mother was a maid and his father worked on the railways. He started work as a delivery boy in a textile firm and learnt the business from the ground up. He got the idea that good quality clothes should be made affordable to ordinary people and this led to him founding Zara in 1975 with his first wife.</p> <p>\"Ortega has been in the right place several times,\" says Jos\u00e9 Luis Nueno of IESE Business School. \"When he started out he was competing against small players with poor distribution in a country that was just discovering fashion.\"</p> <p>Now Zara has 1,659 branches worldwide and accounts for nearly 70% of Inditex's income. Ortega retained a 59% stake when Inditex went public in 2001. Few people would class Ortega as being in the same groundbreaking mould as Sergei Brin or Mark Zuckerberg, but his company has revolutionised the fashion business every bit much as Google and Facebook have revolutionised communications.</p> <p>\"Other companies copy the fast fashion model but only for 10% or 20% of their operation,\" says Nueno. \"For the rest, they stick to the old seasonal collection model. For Inditex it's a combination of design, logistics and store management that makes it possible to do it on the scale they do.\"</p> <p>Zara can get a new design made up and distributed in a week, and it launches about 12,000 new designs every year. To get this in perspective, when Marks &amp; Spencer hit the skids at the beginning of this century, its turnaround time for a new design was close to a year. At Zara, there is no warehousing and reorders are rare, which is one reason the company never advertises: by the time you get to the shop the garment in the ad will have sold out.</p> <p>Secondly, the customer is king. Imaginative use of IT and turning its shop assistants into market researchers means Zara has real-time information about what is selling and where. If customers say they like it in blue but would prefer it in purple, within a week it will be there in purple. This rapid response is made possible partly by keeping most of its production in Europe, largely in Spain, unlike others who have put all their eggs in the Chinese basket.</p> <p>\"Proximity has become very affordable,\" said Nueno. Labour in China is becoming more expensive, as is transport. Inditex is developing integrated operations in Turkey, north Africa and Portugal, areas where the textile industry had been wiped out by competition from China.</p> <p>But the company isn't just alert to its customers' fashion whims. It uses renewable energy sources at its main plant in Arteixo in Galicia and when it discovered a supplier in Brazil was sub-contracting to sweat shops, its response was as firm as it was quick.</p> <p>Then there's the Armancio Ortega Foundation, managed by Marta, daughter of his second wife and heir to the family fortune.</p> <p>While Spain's Galician prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, has slashed spending on schools, Ortega's foundation has just dished out \u20ac11m to create 750 nursery school places in Galicia. Jobs, social responsibility and huge profits \u2013 what's not to like?</p>",

Few people would class Ortega as being in the same groundbreaking mould as Sergei Brin or Mark Zuckerberg, but his company has revolutionised the fashion business every bit much as Google and Facebook have revolutionised communications. \"Other companies copy the fast fashion model but only for 10% or 20% of their operation,\" says Nueno. \"For the rest, they stick to the old seasonal collection model. For Inditex it's a combination of design, logistics and store management that makes it possible to do it on the scale they do.\" Zara can get a new design made up and distributed in a week, and it launches about 12,000 new designs every year. To get this in perspective, when Marks &amp; Spencer hit the skids at the beginning of this century, its turnaround time for a new design was close to a year. At Zara, there is no warehousing and reorders are rare, which is one reason the company never advertises: by the time you get to the shop the garment in the ad will have sold out. Secondly, the customer is king. Imaginative use of IT and turning its shop assistants into market researchers means Zara has real-time information about what is selling and where. If customers say they like it in blue but would prefer it in purple, within a week it will be there in purple. This rapid response is made possible partly by keeping most of its production in Europe, largely in Spain, unlike others who have put all their eggs in the Chinese basket. \"Proximity has become very affordable,\" said Nueno. Labour in China is becoming more expensive, as is transport. Inditex is developing integrated operations in Turkey, north Africa and Portugal, areas where the textile industry had been wiped out by competition from China. But the company isn't just alert to its customers' fashion whims. It uses renewable energy sources at its main plant in Arteixo in Galicia and when it discovered a supplier in Brazil was sub-contracting to sweat shops, its response was as firm as it was quick. Then there's the Armancio Ortega Foundation, managed by Marta, daughter of his second wife and heir to the family fortune. While Spain's Galician prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, has slashed spending on schools, Ortega's foundation has just dished out \u20ac11m to create 750 nursery school places in Galicia. Jobs, social responsibility and huge profits \u2013 what's not to like?",
