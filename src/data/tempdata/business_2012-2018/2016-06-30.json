      "bodyText": "The Bank of England has laid the ground for interest rate cuts following the Brexit vote, as its governorsaid the UK economy is already showing signs of strain. The pound tumbled and shares soared on Mark Carney\u2019s hints that official borrowing costs could be cut further from their record low of 0.5%, perhaps as soon as July. The Bank\u2019s governor used a speech a week after Britain voted to leave the EU to reassure business leaders and investors that the Bank\u2019s contingency plans were \u201cworking well\u201d and that it was considering more measures to safeguard financial stability. The economic outlook for the UK has \u201cdeteriorated\u201d, Carney said, as a backdrop of uncertainty takes its toll. Sterling fell by more than 1% against the euro and dollar on the speech, reflecting an expectation of lower interest rates, softer economic growth and higher inflation, and in late trading, the pound was worth \u20ac1.19 and $1.32. The FTSE 100 closed at its highest level so far this year, up by 2.3% at 6,504.33, as investors hoped that looser borrowing costs would improve business and consumer confidence. The prospect of official interest rates possibly going as low as zero also knocked the yields on UK government bonds, or gilts, to record lows. The first negative-yielding bond appeared following Carney\u2019s speech: a gilt maturing in March 2018 was trading at -0.003%. When interest rates are negative, investors effectively pay the government and banks to park their money. Mitul Patel, the head of interest rates at Henderson Global Investors, said: \u201cThe market now expects interest rates to fall to close to 0%, and while Carney has previously stated a dislike of negative interest rates, nothing can be taken off the table.\u201d Carney said the Bank\u2019s nine-member monetary policy committee, which sets interest rates, faces a trade-off between stabilising inflation, which could be stoked by a weaker pound, and shoring up growth and jobs. But he erred on the side of supporting growth with lower borrowing costs. \u201cIn my view, and I am not prejudging the views of the other independent MPC members, the economic outlook has deteriorated and some monetary policy easing will likely be required over the summer,\u201d Carney said in the speech to bankers and business leaders. \u201cThe committee will make an initial assessment on 14 July and a full assessment complete with a new forecast will follow in the August inflation report. In August, we will also discuss further the range of instruments at our disposal.\u201d Interest rates have been at 0.5% for more than seven years after they were slashed during the UK\u2019s downturn and the global financial crisis. Before the referendum, economists were forecasting that in the event of a vote to stay, the next move in official interest rates would be up. Carney had warned before the referendum that a vote to leave could cause a technical recession, defined as two consecutive quarters of falling output. That warning had angered Brexit backers, with some accusing Carney of \u201ctalking down\u201d the economy, an allegation repeated by the Ukip leader, Nigel Farage, following the governor\u2019s comments. However, Carney stood by his predictions that a vote to leave would hurt growth, while trying to reassure his audience that he could work with the victorious leave campaigners. In a press conference, he was asked how tenable his position as Bank chief was after the triumph of a leave campaign that had repeatedly accused him of politicising his role. Referring to the Bank\u2019s duties, he answered: \u201cIt would be irresponsible of me, or any of my other colleagues, to walk away from those obligations.\u201d Carney avoided the word \u201crecession\u201d, but reiterated the Bank\u2019s pre-referendum forecast that a victory for the leave camp could \u201cmaterially alter the outlook for growth and inflation,\u201d with the risk that households and businesses defer investment. In the past week, there have been signs that some companies are delaying or cancelling investment plans. A poll for YouGov found that consumer confidence had dived in the five days since the referendum. Carney sought to reassure business owners, investors and households that the Bank stood ready to do more to restore confidence. \u201cThe question is not whether the UK will adjust, but rather how quickly and how well,\u201d he said. But he also emphasised that there were limits to what a central bank could do. \u201cThe Bank of England has a plan to achieve our objectives and by doing so support growth, jobs and wages during a time of considerable uncertainty. \u201cPart of that plan is ruthless truth telling. And one uncomfortable truth is that there are limits to what the Bank of England can do.\u201d In a nod to the role of government, Carney said: \u201cThe future potential of this economy and its implications for jobs, real wages and wealth are not the gifts of monetary policymakers.\u201d Carney stepped in almost immediately after the referendum result became clear last week and sought to calm financial market fears about the impact of the Brexit vote by insisting that Threadneedle Street would take any measures needed to secure economic and financial stability. That morning, with the markets wrongfooted over the outcome of the EU referendum, Carney had stressed that banks were stronger than before the 2008 financial crisis. Following the speech on Thursday, financial market players focussed on the immediate implications for interest rates and other monetary policy measures such as quantitative easing, whereby the Bank pumps electronic money into the financial system. But Carney also used the address to take a longer view of the build-up to the referendum and resulting market turmoil. Without referring specifically to the vote, he highlighted a more pronounced focus on inequality as he discussed uncertainty and what he termed \u201ceconomic post-traumatic stress disorder\u201d among households and businesses. \u201cToday, uncertainty has meant an inchoate sense of economic insecurity for many people, despite generalised economic prosperity. Across the advanced economies, employment appears less secure, wages more subdued and inequality more pronounced,\u201d Carney said. Phil Shaw, a UK economist at fund manager Investec, said the governor\u2019s delay of six weeks in publishing the first thorough review into the post-Brexit landscape would leave the City in limbo. \u201cWe remember when Mervyn King said nothing for weeks after Northern Rock went bust and the uncertainty it created,\u201d he said. Shaw said the Bank was likely to supplement a rate cut with other measures, including an expansion of the funding for lending scheme that supports bank and building society mortgage lending.",

      "bodyText": "\u201c[A] plan beats no plan,\u201d said the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, which was presumably a dig at the squabbling political class. And here\u2019s the first part of his plan: interest rates will probably be cut in the summer. It is a sensible move. As even the most blinkered members of the leave camp should be able to see, a short-term hit to UK economic growth is likely. So best to get your retaliation in early, or at least signal your intentions, to help absorb the initial shock of Brexit. The Bank could have waited until sterling, down 10% against the dollar since the referendum last Thursday, had settled at a new level, which will be a matter of weeks, rather than days. A delay would have the advantage of allowing the Bank to fine tune its post-Brexit estimates of UK growth and inflation, and thus provide the hard evidence for easing monetary policy. But why wait for precision? It is obvious that growth forecasts will be lower and inflation projections will be higher. It could hardly be otherwise after sterling\u2019s decline. But the clear priority is to stimulate the economy, and encourage confidence among businesses and consumers. Inflation risks are next year\u2019s problem. If the Bank\u2019s first response was straightforward, life will get harder thereafter. Should the economy slump, or inflation soar, Threadneedle Street will face \u201ca tradeoff between stabilising inflation on the one hand, and avoiding undue volatility in output and employment on the other,\u201d said Carney. Yes, that tradeoff is where policy setting dangers lurk. The important part of Carney\u2019s speech was the ending. \u201cOne uncomfortable truth is that there are limits to what the Bank of England can do,\u201d he said. With the Bank rate already at 0.5%, it\u2019s almost a statement of the obvious. Adventures into the murky world of negative interest rates could be dangerous \u2013 they might \u201cperversely reduce credit availability or even increase its overall price\u201d \u2013 and quantitative easing looks increasingly pointless if 10-year gilt yields are below 1%. It\u2019s up to the politicians to get their act together, as Carney obviously did not put it. Brexiter Leadsom owes Bank\u2019s governor an apology Carney defused questions about his relationship with the Conservative Brexiters who attacked him personally during the referendum campaign. Very wise. But it is now time for some of those politicians to apologise. Andrea Leadsom, as one of the candidates for the Tory leadership, has most to answer for. Leadsom had accused the governor of overstepping his remit when he said the UK\u2019s exit from the EU could lead to a recession, and accused him of promoting financial instability. It was an \u201cincredibly dangerous intervention,\u201d she claimed. Leadsom was talking guff. Carney could hardly pretend that the referendum wasn\u2019t happening. He was always scrupulously careful to stay well within the Bank\u2019s remit of assessing the potential impact on monetary and financial stability. He explained his thinking when cross-examined twice by the Treasury select committee. He did his job. If Leadsom wants to be considered seriously as a future chancellor, which one assumes is her real goal, the first act of her leadership campaign should be a public apology. In its absence, she is unfit for No 11. Political chaos grounds airport expansion decision Governments have been dithering over Heathrow and runways in the south-east of England for decades, so a further official delay of a few months makes little difference, even if it brought forth the usual bleats from the business lobby about a \u201cmissed opportunity\u201d. What did the business leaders expect? David Cameron had tied himself in knots with his famous \u201cno ifs, no buts\u201d pledge to oppose a third runway at Heathrow. On the final lap of his premiership, it was a simple matter to leave the toxic issue to his successor. In theory, one obstacle \u2013 Boris Johnson\u2019s political credibility \u2013 has just been helpfully removed for Heathrow. But Theresa May, who represents the nearby constituency of Maidenhead, is also an opponent, at least officially. Is her opposition zealous or of the high-hurdle-to-expansion variety? It\u2019s hard to tell. Michael Gove\u2019s constituency of Surrey Heath is just as close as May\u2019s to Heathrow, but it is not on as many flight paths. The airport may draw hope from all those fired-up Gove speeches about the UK broadening its trading horizons and looking beyond Europe. The bet here, however, is that the latest delay will be followed by another. Cameron\u2019s administration could not face the political fallout even when it had the cover of a report from the Airports Commission. A new prime minister may wish to consider the cases for Heathrow and Gatwick again \u2013 slowly. It is always the easiest policy. Capital gains from Singaporean bank\u2019s caution Here\u2019s one quick win from Brexit: Singapore\u2019s third-largest bank has stopped lending to punters who want to buy homes in London for investment purposes. United Overseas Bank said it wants to protect its customers from \u201cpotential foreign exchange and sovereign risks\u201d. Protect them as long as you wish. Less property speculation from abroad sounds like excellent news for Londoners.",

Andrea Leadsom, as one of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/30/conservative-leadership-race-who-are-the-five-candidates\">candidates for the Tory leadership</a>, has most to answer for.</p> <p>Leadsom had <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/15/brexit-minister-bank-of-england-dangerous-intervention-andrea-leadsom-financial-markets-eu\">accused the governor of overstepping his remit </a>when he said the UK\u2019s exit from the EU <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/12/bank-of-england-keeps-interest-rates-on-hold-as-brexit-fears-bite\">could lead to a recession</a>, and accused him of promoting financial instability. It was an \u201cincredibly dangerous intervention,\u201d she claimed.</p> <p>Leadsom was talking guff. Carney could hardly pretend that the referendum wasn\u2019t happening. He was always scrupulously careful to stay well within the Bank\u2019s remit of assessing the potential impact on monetary and financial stability. He <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/08/mark-carney-bank-of-england-brussels-eu-deal-supports-financial-stability\">explained his thinking when cross-examined</a> twice by the Treasury select committee. He did his job.</p> <p>If Leadsom wants to be considered seriously as a future chancellor, which one assumes is her real goal, the first act of her leadership campaign should be a public apology. In its absence, she is unfit for No 11.</p> <h2>Political chaos grounds airport expansion decision</h2> <p>Governments have been dithering over Heathrow and runways in the south-east of England for decades, so a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/30/airport-expansion-decision-heathrow-gatwick-to-be-left-to-camerons-successor\">further official delay of a few months</a> makes little difference, even if it brought forth the usual bleats from the business lobby about a \u201cmissed opportunity\u201d.</p> <p>What did the business leaders expect? <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/07/david-cameron-attacked-for-delaying-heathrow-expansion-decision\">David Cameron had tied himself in knots</a> with his famous \u201cno ifs, no buts\u201d pledge to oppose a third runway at Heathrow. On the final lap of his premiership, it was a simple matter to leave the toxic issue to his successor.</p> <p>In theory, one obstacle \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/30/boris-johnson-rules-himself-out-of-tory-leadership-race-brexit-eu-referendum\">Boris Johnson\u2019s political credibility</a> \u2013 has just been helpfully removed for Heathrow. But Theresa May, who represents the nearby constituency of Maidenhead, is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/30/theresa-may-launches-tory-leadership-bid-with-pledge-to-unite-country\">also an opponent, at least officially</a>. Is her opposition zealous or of the high-hurdle-to-expansion variety? It\u2019s hard to tell.</p> <p>Michael Gove\u2019s constituency of Surrey Heath is just as close as May\u2019s to Heathrow, but it is not on as many flight paths. The airport may draw hope from all those fired-up Gove speeches about the UK broadening its trading horizons and looking beyond Europe.</p> <p>The bet here, however, is that the latest delay will be followed by another. Cameron\u2019s administration could not face the political fallout even when it had the cover of a report from the Airports Commission. A new prime minister may wish to consider the cases for Heathrow and Gatwick again \u2013 slowly. It is always the easiest policy.</p> <h2>Capital gains from Singaporean bank\u2019s caution</h2> <p>Here\u2019s one quick win from Brexit: Singapore\u2019s third-largest bank <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/30/brexit-prompts-major-singapore-bank-to-stop-lending-for-london-properties\">has stopped lending to punters</a> who want to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/may/26/revealed-9-rise-in-london-properties-owned-by-offshore-firms\">buy homes in London for investment</a> purposes. United Overseas Bank said it wants to protect its customers from \u201cpotential foreign exchange and sovereign risks\u201d. Protect them as long as you wish. Less property speculation from abroad sounds like excellent news for Londoners.</p>",

    "webTitle": "Goldman Sachs banker handed out iPods to win Libyan deal, court hears", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A former Goldman Sachs banker gave iPods to members of the Libyan Investment Authority (LIA) as well as paying for prostitutes, and was one of the Wall Street firm\u2019s top global salesmen in 2008 as a result of its business with the investment fund, the high court in London has heard. The LIA is suing Goldman for $1.2bn of losses on nine trades that the US bank executed on its behalf between January and April 2008. The fund was set up in 2006 by the late Libyan dictator, Muammar Gaddafi, to manage the country\u2019s oil wealth. Goldman is disputing the claim, which was filed in 2014, saying the LIA was the victim of the 2008 financial crash, not of any wrongdoing by the bank. Andrea Vella, a senior Goldman executive who is the first witness called by the bank, was questioned by LIA\u2019s barrister, Philip Edey QC, on Thursday. When the barrister told him that the former Goldman executive Youssef Kabbaj had given iPods to LIA staff, Vella expressed surprise and replied: \u201cI am upset, disappointed.\u201d Kabbaj also paid for prostitutes to win business from the fund, the court heard. When asked by Edey whether this, along with gifting iPods, \u201cwould be completely unacceptable conduct for a Goldman Sachs employee\u201d and \u201ccrossing a serious line\u201d, Vella replied: \u201cIt would have been unacceptable.\u201d The court was shown an email, sent in August 2008 by Karen O\u2019Keeffe, Goldman\u2019s vice-president of employee relations. She wrote: \u201cThe firm has a relatively new relationship with the Libyan Investment Authority. As I am sure you can all imagine, there has been significant scrutiny over this particular client \u2013 which happens to be a very significant account for the firm. \u201cYoussef, who is a VP and has been with the firm since only 2006, is the primary point of contact with the LIA. This will be a difficult situation to resolve since Youssef is one of the top, if not the top, salesperson globally, as a result of this single client.\u201d Vella told the court that Kabbaj was motivated by money. \u201cI didn\u2019t think he would do anything for money ... Was he very focused on his compensation? He definitely was.\u201d Vella said he now recognised that Kabbaj was dishonest, but did not think so at the time. Pressed by Edey whether all three junior Goldman employees on the coverage team for the LIA were \u201cdishonest and have made up for the purposes of financial gain their accounts of the relationship with the LIA?\u201d Vella replied: \u201cYes.\u201d The court was shown a chapter of Greg Smith\u2019s book Why I Left Goldman Sachs about \u201chunting elephants\u201d, an investment banking euphemism for big deals. Vella said: \u201cIf you asked people at Goldman Sachs, if they were aware of the details of the Libyan transactions \u2026 probably many of them would define them as elephant trades.\u201d The court also heard that Vella and other Goldman bankers were advising the Libyan fund on investments, but Vella insisted that this \u201chigh-level strategic advice\u201d was done on an informal basis and \u201cthere is no implication that anyone could rely on that advice\u201d. A key allegation by the LIA is that Goldman exploited the financial naivety of its staff. Vella rejected this claim in his witness statement, saying he was \u201cpleased and impressed with the level of sophistication\u201d. But when cross-examined by Edey, he admitted that the bank was aware that some LIA staff lacked financial sophistication. \u201cWhat was conveyed to me was that we had to be cautious \u2026 that there were people at the LIA that were not sophisticated,\u201d Vella said. In his statement, Vella said that the LIA fully understood the disputed trades and obtained the exposure it wanted but the underlying shares did not perform as it had anticipated. The case continues.",

In a move that will increase the borrowing costs for the 28-member bloc, the credit ratings agency S&amp;P said the EU should see its status as a safe haven for investors reduced to AA from AA+. The agency said: \u201cAfter the decision by the UK electorate to leave the EU \u2026 we have reassessed our opinion of cohesion within the EU, which we now consider to be a neutral rather than positive rating factor.\u201d International investors use credit agency reports to gauge the safety of their funds and the likelihood that their investments will become insolvent.

Over in New York, shares have continued to recover their Brexit losses. The prospect of more stimulus from the Bank of England drove money into equities. The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 235.31 points, or 1.3%, to 17,929.99, only 90 points below its high before the UK referendum. The S&amp;P 500 climbed 28.09 points, or 1.4%, to 2,098.86, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 63.43 points, or 1.3%, to 4,842.67. We\u2019ll be back later with the close of Wall Street. But otherwise, thanks for reading and during another highly dramatic day that is best summed up by this tweet: Mark Carney\u2019s pledge to take action to support the UK economy has been welcomed on Wall Street, where the Brexit crisis is being closely watched. The main US stock indices are all up around 1% this afternoon. Newsflash: Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s has downgraded the European Union\u2019s credit rating from AA+ to AA, the third-highest rating. The move comes three days after S&amp;P stripped the UK of its final triple-A rating. S&amp;P took the move following Britain\u2019s Brexit vote, saying that it will lessen the EU\u2019s fiscal flexibility and weaken political cohesion in the region. The agency says: We think that, going forward, revenue forecasting, long-term capital planning, and adjustments to key financial buffers of the EU will be subject to greater uncertainty. It also predicts that wealthier EU members will have to pay a larger share into the EU budget, to cover the UK\u2019s lost contributions. The downgrade is mainly symbolic -- most EU borrowing is conducted by member states, of course. But it\u2019s a signal that Europe is going to be harmed by the UK\u2019s departure. The FTSE 250 index of medium-sized UK firms has also rallied today. It is up 1.7%, which still leaves it below its pre-referendum level. Record low interest rates is particularly bad news for savers. Most savers tend to be older people. More older people voted to leave the European Union than remain in it. So, intentionally or not, they\u2019re going to cover some of the cost of the crisis: Here\u2019s Gerard Lyons, one of the economists who campaigned for Britain to leave the UK: Amid the chaos of UK politics, Mark Carney has emerged as one policymaker with a clear strategy to tackle the crisis. Ranko Berich, head of market analysis at Monex Europe, says: British politics may have deteriorated from House of Cards to Monty Python this week, but Mark Carney did an admirable job of communicating that the BoE is one institution with a post-Brexit plan. Aside from a big hint towards future rate cuts, no policy measures were announced today, but that was not the point of the speech. Carney was out to reassure markets that there was no impending financial crisis, even though the UK economy is facing huge uncertainty. He performed exceptionally well in this regard, and refused to be drawn into Britain\u2019s escalating political turmoil. The first negative-yielding gilt has appeared in the UK following Carney\u2019s speech today (as flagged a few minute ago). A gilt maturing in March 2018 traded at -0.003%, as expectations for further easing from the Bank increased. According to Mitul Patel, head of interest rates at Henderson Global Investors: \u201cThe market now expects interest rates to fall to close to 0%, and whilst Carney has previously stated a dislike of negative interest rates, nothing can be taken off the table.\u201d He added that interest rates \u201care unlikely to go up for several years following the EU referendum result.\u201d Here\u2019s Katie Allen\u2019s story on Mark Carney\u2019s speech, for anyone just tuning in: The Bank of England is likely to have to cut interest rates over the coming months to cushion the blow to the economy from the Brexit vote, its governor, Mark Carney, has said. Carney used a speech a week after Britain voted to leave the EU to reassure business leaders and investors that the Bank\u2019s contingency plans were \u201cworking well\u201d and that it was considering more measures to safeguard financial stability. He gave the strongest indication yet that the Bank\u2019s reaction to the market turmoil and uncertainty caused by the Brexit vote would be to cut interest rates from the current record low of 0.5%, perhaps as soon as July. The pound tumbled by 1.5\u00a2 to $1.326 against the US dollar following Carney\u2019s speech on the prospect of a new stimulus package, as traders anticipated a cut in rates. The Bank\u2019s nine-member monetary policy committee faces a tradeoff between stabilising inflation, which could be stoked by a weaker pound, and shoring up growth and jobs, Carney said. But he erred on the side of supporting growth with lower borrowing costs. \u201cIn my view, and I am not prejudging the views of the other independent MPC members, the economic outlook has deteriorated and some monetary policy easing will likely be required over the summer,\u201d Carney said in the speech to bankers and business leaders. \u201cThe committee will make an initial assessment on 14 July and a full assessment complete with a new forecast will follow in the August inflation report. In August, we will also discuss further the range of instruments at our disposal.\u201d More here: Investors are also diving into UK government debt, which is a sign they expect weak growth and ultra-low interest raters. They are now paying MORE than the face value of two-year UK bonds, which means the interest rate on those bond is now negative. More reaction to the governor\u2019s speech: Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown, reckons the BoE will cut rates at its August meeting (rather than next week) The Bank will update its forecasts and make a full assessment of the economic picture in its August Inflation Report. This probably leaves August as the likeliest date for a rate cut, though swap markets are pricing in a July cut as more likely than not (a 57% probability), and a 73% chance of a rate cut by August. He also explains that Carney and colleagues will be worried that the weak pound will push inflation higher, but they might ignore that and ease monetary policy anyway..... Carney and his MPC colleagues could face a delicate balancing act over the coming months, balancing higher inflation caused by the weaker pound with the need to stimulate growth. If history is anything to go by, growth will be the priority \u2013 remember the Bank was willing to \u2018look through\u2019 elevated inflation in the first phase of the financial crisis and cut rates to their current lows. The prospect of UK interest rates being cut to fresh record lows has wiped two cents off the pound, which is now trading at $1.322. That\u2019s only one cent above Monday\u2019s 31-year low. Caxton FX analyst Nicholas Laser-Ebisch says Carney didn\u2019t give traders any reasons to buy sterling: Sterling dropped by more than 1% across the board as Carney admitted that \u201csome monetary policy easing\u201d was likely required as a response to the Brexit vote, acknowledging the risk that taking action would have, both on individuals and businesses. Market participants were watching this impromptu press conference for signs of reassurance, but the BOE governor\u2019s speech inspired no confidence. The weak pound drove up the share price of companies with large overseas operations -- as the dollars and euros they earn will be worth more. So, the top risers on the FTSE 100 included drinks firm Diageo, and mining groups Antofagasta and Anglo American. Alarmingly, though, banks shares fell again today. A rate cut would make it even harder for them to make a profit. Building companies are also still under pressure, with Berkeley Homes and Barratt both among the top fallers. Traders are still calculating that the Brexit vote is bad for the demand in the housing sector. Savings rates had been falling anyway, even though the Bank of England base rate has been static at 0.5% since 2009, and now it seems almost inevitable that they will continue to plummet to new lows. According to financial website Moneyfacts.co.uk, the average easy-access cash Isa rate has fallen by 0.11% in six months to just 0.98%, the first time on record it has fallen below 1%. In May the website recorded 18 savings rate rises and 156 cuts. Spokeswoman Charlotte Nelson says: \u201cIt\u2019s not a good time to be a saver in today\u2019s market,\u201d The link between the base rate and savings rates has already been cut - though that does not mean banks and building societies will not reduce rates if and when the base rate is cut to, say, 0.25% or zero. Nelson said that if there was a base rate cut, \u201cit gives cause for them to cut rates, and makes it almost acceptable to do so. On 1 June Nationwide became the latest big-name provider to cut rates on many of its accounts. As to what savers should do, one way of achieving a secure income is to opt for a fixed-rate savings bond. But some may feel that the rates on these are paltry: even bonds on sale today that involve locking your money away for five years are only paying an average of 2.05% - down from 2.1% on the day of the referendum, 23 June. New one and two-year fixed-rate bonds are paying an average of 1.17% and 1.41% respectively. If you are on a \u2018tracker\u2019 deal, then the impact of a Bank of England rate cut is instant. For example, Nationwide building society has just under 600,000 people on its \u2018base mortgage rate\u2019 which is 2% above Bank of England base rate. \u201cThere is no floor, so if the Bank Rate was cut then the rate would reduce\u201d says a spokeswoman. Someone with a \u00a3150,000 Nationwide mortgage would see their repayments cut from \u00a3673 a month to \u00a3654 if Carney cuts base rates to 0.25. If he slashes them to zero, then the mortgage costs drops to \u00a3636. The impact is even bigger if the borrower has an interest-only mortgage, although these have largely disappeared since the credit crunch. They would see the cost of servicing a \u00a3150,000 loan drop from \u00a3313 a month to \u00a3281 at base rate of 0.25%, dropping to \u00a3250 once rates hit zero. Anyone on a fixed-rate mortgage will see no change. But in the coming week banks and building societies are expected to line up cheaper deals reflecting the new money market rates, with plenty more sub-2% fixes available, even for those with a relatively low deposit. Bloomberg\u2019s Jeff Black was impressed by Mark Carney\u2019s performance: Jamie McGeever of Reuters points out the UK faces huge challenges: Anna Stupnytska, global economist at Fidelity International, says Carney had a clear message: And the FT\u2019s Sarah O\u2019Conner sums up Carney\u2019s key message: The prospect of more monetary stimulus has acted like Class A catnip in the City. Shares have soared, as soon as Mark Carney hinted that the Bank of England will ease monetary policy this summer - probably by cutting interest rates or through a new QE programme. The FTSE 100 index has hit its highest level since last August, up 144 points at 6504: There is a proviso - the slump in the pound means that the FTSE 100 is worth rather less in dollar terms. But still, it shows that investor are expecting the BoE to take significant action this summer: Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, says: The FTSE has broken to the highest level since August 2015 today, with the UK 10 year yield hitting an alltime low after comments from Mark Carney provided a new dovish bias upon monetary policy going forward However.... Mark Carney has delivered a somewhat downbeat assessment of UK economic hopes today, with the BoE governor stating that we are likely to see some form of easing over the summer. The worries that had impacted investment decisions prior to the vote are now likely to intensify and whilst Carney said he was willing to act, the ability of monetary policy to fix these problems are of course limited. UKIP leader Nigel Farage has criticised Mark Carney.... ...and been slapped down by the US economics editor of The Economist.... ...and others: Finally, another question about Mark Carney\u2019s clashes with the Leave campaign. Governor Carney patiently explains that he was doing his job by pointing out the risks in leaving the EU. Britain is now prepared, so the task of adjusting to Brexit will be easier. And he insists that he is not planning to leave the Bank. Carney declines to say whether he agrees with his predecessor, Lord King, that the Remain campaign\u2019s economic warnings were over the top. Carney insists that the Bank has a range of options on the table (or in its monetary toolkit). So, it has cut interest rates and boosted quantitative easing (buying bonds with new money) in the past, but it it might do something different this time.... Q: Did the Bank of England intervene in the markets last Friday to calm the crisis? Carney says there were some \u201cpretty big moves\u201d in the currency, as should be expected. The markets functioned well, and there was no liquidity shortage - so the pound moved on investors\u2019 views. And when markets are functioning well, you don\u2019t want to get in the way. So, that\u2019s a no. Q: Is a recession likely? We\u2019ll have to wait until the Bank\u2019s new economic forecasts in early August. Q: Today\u2019s speech is quite unprecedented, so does it show the scale of the economic crisis? Carney says the Bank\u2019s remit has changed in recent years, giving it a broader remit. It now holds responsibility for monetary stability, and financial security (unlike during the credit crunch) Also, standards of transparency have changed - the public, businesses and the media all expect a rapid response. The Bank can meet in an afternoon, and take decisions, if needed. Q: How can the Bank protect the UK economy during the shambles playing out in politics? Carney declines to describe British politics as a shambles. But when there is \u201cpolicy uncertainty\u201d, the Bank can adjust and fine-tune its policies to try and anticipate the impact. Onto questions Q: Could you work with Brexit campaigners who have criticised your conduct during the EU referendum campaign, if one became the next chancellor? Carney says that his concerns about leaving the EU were shared by all policymakers at the Bank of England. All those individuals are committed to discharging their responsibilities. This is a professional, technocratic institution, and we will continue to do our jobs. Carney is on good form. He now tells us about a weathervane in the Bank of England which was installed in 1805, to help the BoE handle the economy. When the wind blew from the east, ships could come up the Thames, so merchants would need credit to buy goods. When it came from the west, credit should be withdrawn. Carney calls it a \u201cRegency-era forecasting model\u201d that helped the bank provide stability. Today, the economy is more complex, and our forecasting models are a little less reliable.... There\u2019s no argument, though, that the winds have changed -- and this time, the Bank cannot fully offset the consequences. We face a trade-off between stabilising inflation on the one hand and avoiding undue volatility in output and employment on the other, says Carney. So.... although he\u2019s not pre-judging the view of his fellow policymakers, the economic outlook has deteriorated and some monetary policy easing will likely be required over the summer. Carney now explains how uncertainty will hurt the economy. There is a danger that UK households could defer consumption (ie, delay buying new things) and firms delay investment -- which would push unemployment higher. There are also risks of adverse spillovers to the global economy. There\u2019s also a risk that supply growth will be lower over the next three years, he adds. Quick explainer - the pound has fallen, because traders are anticipating that the Bank could cut interest rates to fresh record lows (meaning you get even less for holding your money in sterling). This time, the financial system will dampen the aftershock of recent events, rather than amplifying them, Carney pledges. We\u2019ll hold you to that, Mark.... Mark Carney is now outlining the Bank of England\u2019s plans to fight the uncertainty created by Brexit. He says that the BoE has already taken steps to bolster the capital held by commercial banks, after the 2008 crisis showed that they weren\u2019t carrying enough. Banks have raised over \u00a3130bn of capital, and have large amounts of liquid assets, he says. Then there\u2019s an announcement: Carney says the Bank will run weekly auctions to pump new liquidity into the financial system until September, to avoid a credit crunch. It usually runs these auctions monthly. The pound has tumbled by one and a half cents, to $1.326 against the US dollar, on the prospect of a new stimulus package. Carney is warning that the Bank\u2019s previous fears of a Brexit slowdown are now its \u201ccentral forecast\u201d. The Bank of England will likely have to cut interest rates over coming months to cushion the blow to the economy from the Brexit vote, says Katie Allen (who has attended the lock-in at the Bank). She writes: Carney is using a speech just a week after Britain\u2019s historic vote to leave the EU to reassure business leaders and investors that the Bank\u2019s contingency plans were \u201cworking well\u201d and that it was considering more measures to safeguard financial stability. He will give the strongest indication yet that the Bank\u2019s reaction to the market turmoil and uncertainty caused by the Brexit vote will be to cut interest rates from the current record low of 0.5%, perhaps as soon as next month. The Bank\u2019s nine-member monetary policy committee (MPC) faces a trade-off between stabilising inflation \u2013 which could be stoked by a weaker pound - and shoring up growth and jobs, Carney said. But he erred on the side of supporting growth with lower borrowing costs. \u201cIn my view, and I am not pre-judging the views of the other independent MPC members, the economic outlook has deteriorated and some monetary policy easing will likely be required over the summer,\u201d Carney said in the speech to bankers and business leaders. Carney reiterates that the Bank of England is prepared to take action to protect the UK economy from the impact of leaving the EU. But there\u2019s only so much that monetary policy can do. People ask basic questions at these times, Carney continues. Will inflation go up, will other people lose their jobs? Will I lose mine? This prompts a bout of giggling in the room, given the speculation that Brexit campaigners may want to drive Carney back to Canada. Here comes Mark Carney, bank on time. The governor begins by saying that while the result of last week\u2019s referendum is clear, its implications are not. This country can handle change, he continues, It has one of the most flexible economies in the world, and world class infrastructure. Its people are admired around the world over for their strength in adversity. So the question is not whether the UK can adjust, but how quickly and how well. But.... the decision to leave the UK is a major regime shift, he continues. Financial reporters are locked in the Bank of England until 4pm, so we should get a flurry of news very soon.... I\u2019m guessing grey. Mark Carney\u2019s speech should be streamed on the Bank of England\u2019s website (although it\u2019s struggling to load right now). It\u2019s also been carried on the UK news channels, such as Sky. Bloomberg\u2019s Jeff Black has flagged up the nightmare scenario for the City..... Newsflash from Washington: The International Monetary Fund has warned that uncertainty over the UK\u2019s future is likely to dampen near-term growth; in Britain, Europe and the world economy. The IMF will include this effect in its next economic forecasts, on July 19th. Joe Rundle, head of trading at ETX Capital, believes Carney needs to be straight with the British people about the consequences of Brexit. He worries that some investors are too complacent, which is why the FTSE 100 index is now higher than before the vote. The FSTE 100 continues to pump, jacked up on frenzied bargain buyers piling into the index\u2019s largely overseas-focused companies and defensive stocks. HSBC has confirmed it won\u2019t move its headquarters outside of London and its stocks is up 1% today \u2013 to above pre-Brexit levels. To level things out Carney really needs to play it cautious and once again stress the downside risks and concerns about the UK economy longer term from Brexit. I missed this earlier, but apparently Mark Carney declined a pay rise this year. Reuters has the details, from the Bank\u2019s annual report: Canadian Carney, who earns a basic salary of \u00a3480,000 ($645,000) a year and has a \u00a3250,000 annual housing allowance, has been a central figure in the response fromBritish authorities to leaving the European Union. The Bank declined to comment on Carney\u2019s reasons for rejecting a pay rise. Median gross earnings for full-time British employees stood at \u00a327,600 for the year ending in April 2015. Brexit campaigners could have the knives out for Mark Carney, after he angered them during the referendum campaign by warning of the economic risks of Leaving the EU. Journalist Ben Chu suggests that Boris Johnson would have supported the governor, but other Brexiters might have other plans..... Carney is currently on a five-year contract that expires in summer 2018, but he could possibly ask to extend it for three years [governors typically serve eight-year terms] Economists, journalists and camera crews are massing at the Bank of England as attention turns to Mark Carney\u2019s upcoming speech about life after the EU referendum. After a week of stomach-churning political changes, the BoE\u2019s governor will aim to reassure the public, and investors at home and abroad, that the Brexit vote won\u2019t cause a new crisis. Carney is due to speak at 4pm UK time and should take questions afterwards. Last Friday, he was quick to address the nation after the referendum result, saying the UK economy was in good shape to ride out the situation. We\u2019re hoping for more details about the Bank\u2019s plans to protect jobs and ward off a recession. City experts are pleased that the BoE is taking an approach to the crisis. Alan Clarke, an economist at Scotiabank, told Bloomberg: I don\u2019t ever remember being invited to any briefings from the Bank of England at the height of the credit crunch in 2008-09, so it\u2019s quite refreshing that the BoE is being so open. It\u2019s very good that someone is being proactive, because there\u2019s been pretty much radio silence from the \u2018Vote Leave\u2019 leadership since Friday. The BBC\u2019s Kevin Peachey reckons Carney will strike a reassuring tone: The independent economist Shaun Richards wonders whether Carney might announce a new offer of cheap credit to encourage bank lending: The US stock market has opened, and the main indices are creeping higher ... Senior staff at Lloyds Banking Group have given their company a vote of confidence by snapping up tens of thousands of Lloyds shares each. The bank has told the City that 19 board members and top managers bought shares this week. They moved after seeing them fall from 72p to about 55p after the Brexit vote. Lloyds shares are down 3% at 53p today, so they\u2019re not in profit quite yet ... The Bank of England\u2019s annual report is out. In it, the Bank admits that it doesn\u2019t know the impact of the Brexit vote on its balance sheet, saying: The United Kingdom held a referendum on 23 June on whether or not to remain a member of the European Union. As a result of the decision to leave the EU, the Bank continues to consider the implications of this decision on its strategy, business plan and balance sheet. A reasonable estimate of the impact on the balance sheet cannot be made at this time due to volatility preventing use of appropriate market pricing. It also shows that the Bank\u2019s governor, Mark Carney, received almost \u00a3880,000 last year in pay, pension and benefits. It\u2019s an old cliche that markets hate uncertainty. Some investors deny that this is true: at least, those with the nerve to take big bets at times of wild volatility. But the dramatic shakeup of British politics has brought some clarity \u2013 Boris Johnson certainly won\u2019t be the next prime minister. Ken Odeluga, a market analyst at City Index, reckons this \u201csurprising increase in certainty\u201d could reassure the City in the short term. However, there\u2019s still no indication that leaving the EU will be easy. He says: EU negotiations might now begin sooner than expected, if signs of a push to elect a Conservative leader as early as September prove accurate. If EU/UK horse trading does kick off early, uncertainty could be reduced even further. (Almost regardless of how favourable or unfavourable the outcome is deemed to be). However, the latest twists and turns of the Brexit saga have done little to improve the market\u2019s ability to assess the UK\u2019s prospect of extracting the best possible deal with the EU. On that basis, it\u2019s still difficult to believe that \u2018risky\u2019 assets like stocks and sterling will be able to hold their newly regained poise for much longer. Especially if signs of stability do not emerge in Westminster soon. Investors are \u201cunsure about almost everything\u201d, says Kit Juckes of Societe Generale. The \u2018Brexit, what Brexit?\u2019 recovery in risk sentiment is just about continuing in emerging markets and equities, but the pound, euro, and Australian and New Zealand dollars have run out of puff overnight. Investors everywhere are a bit unsure what the UK\u2019s departure from the EU will look like and what it means, a mindset that may now last a while. We can\u2019t expect many fireworks on Wall Street today. The US stock market is expected to open flattish, matching the mood in Europe. The \u201cBoris bounce\u201d didn\u2019t last too long ... The pound is pushing a little higher after Boris Johnson stunned British politics by announcing that he will not run to be the next Conservative Party leader and prime minister. So, after leading the campaign to leave the EU, Boris won\u2019t be dealing with the consequences. Instead, it looks like a choice between Theresa May \u2013 who is still the odds-on favourite \u2013 and Michael Gove. The FTSE 100, however, is dipping back to its opening levels having hit a two-month high this morning, as traders digest a morning of remarkable news. The FTSE 250 index, made up mainly of UK companies, remains a better gauge of the UK economy than the multinational firms on the FTSE 100. Joe Rundle, head of trading at ETX Capital, explains why: \u201cThe FTSE 100 has rallied to its pre-Brexit levels and is holding on to most of yesterday\u2019s big gains this morning. However, the UK-focused FTSE 250 remains down 8% and this speaks volumes about the split between UK and international companies. \u201cThe blue chip index is stuffed full with big international firms and it is these companies propelling the rise. The heavy weighting towards these groups is very misleading.\u201d Connor Campbell of SpreadEx agrees that the political machinations playing out in Westminster have helped calm the markets. Gains in the commodity sector seem to be driving the FTSE\u2019s rise, though losses in the banking and property sectors are preventing it from matching the growth seen on Tuesday and Wednesday. The UK index was likely aided by the semblance of order returning to the Tory party, with Theresa May (who has so far provided the most thorough Brexit outline) the frontrunner for PM, followed by Michael Gove, who plunged a knife into the back of former heir apparent Boris Johnson with his own leadership announcement this morning. European stock markets are also enjoying a Brexit bounceback this morning: Bank shares are lagging, though. The news that Santander and Deutsche Bank failed US bank stress tests last night isn\u2019t helping the sector. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 has hit a new two-month high as City investors remain calm about the Brexit crisis \u2013 and watch another remarkable day of political drama. The blue-chip index is now up 35 points, or 0.6%, at 6397. That\u2019s the highest level since 20 April, having recovered its referendum losses yesterday. Importantly, though, this is all measured in sterling \u2013 shares are still down in dollars and euros. Banks and building firms remain under pressure and the FTSE 250 index, which contains more UK companies, is slightly down today. Nonetheless, the Brexit panic does seem to have abated, especially after Theresa May\u2019s entry into the Tory leadership contest; she\u2019s now the frontrunner at Betfair, while support for Boris Johnson ebbs away after Michael Gove\u2019s sensational move into the race this morning. Investors may be reassured that May laid out a clear plan to deal with the Brexit vote. She also pledged not to hit Britain with an emergency budget and criticised George Osborne\u2019s \u2018balanced budget\u2019 rule, saying: While it is absolutely vital that the government continues with its intention to reduce public spending and reduce the budget deficit, we should no longer seek to produce a budget surplus by the end of the parliament. As predicted earlier, Brexit has been top of the agenda at TheCityUK\u2019s annual conference in London this morning. John MacFarlane, the chairman of Barclays, urged politicians to show leadership to tackle the \u201cself-inflicted wound\u201d to the UK economy. HSBC\u2019s chairman, Douglas Flint, argued that the UK\u2019s contingency planning worked well: And the UK head of accountancy firm Deloitte, David Sproul, tried to sound upbeat ... A gobbet of eurozone economic news: The inflation rate has risen to 0.1%, from -0.1% in May. As usual, energy prices were a drag on prices, but food, industrial goods and services prices all rose. That will please the European Central Bank in its battle to fight deflation, although the Brexit shock has already changed the landscape.... Back in Westminster, Theresa May is launching her pitch to be Conservative leader, and the next prime minister. Investors need to pay attention, as the Home Secretary is now the odds-on favourite (following Michael Gove\u2019s attempt to torpedo Boris Johnson this morning). May has said that: Last week\u2019s EU referendum is irreversible; the will of the people must be respected. May wouldn\u2019t trigger Article 50 before the end of this year (which means she would trigger it) She doesn\u2019t want an \u2018emergency budget\u2019; fiscal issues should be tackled in an autumn statement as usual. She also suggests that the target of a budget surplus by 2020 could be ditched, if necessary. Our Politics Liveblog has full details. We also have new current account figures for the UK, and they paint an alarming picture. The gap between the amount of goods, services and investment coming into the UK, and going out, was an eye-watering \u00a332.593bn in January-March. That\u2019s 6.9% of GDP, and only slightly better than the \u00a333.963bn recorded in October-December 2015. Newsflash: Britain\u2019s economy suffered a deeper plunge after the 2008 financial crisis than previously thought. The Office for National Statistics has revised its data, and concluded that UK GDP shrank by 6.3%, not 6.1% as first thought. They also confirmed that the UK GDP grew by 0.4% in the last quarter. Big breaking news in the UK: Michael Gove, one of the key Leave campaigners, has announced that he\u2019s running for the leadership of the Conservative Party. And he has also launched a potentially devastating attack on Boris Johnson, saying the ex-Mayor of London lacks the leadership to be prime minister. Our Politics Liveblog has full coverage: Billionaire investors-turned-philanthropist George Soros has warned European politicians that the Brexit vote is a \u2018huge shock\u2019 to their economy. Speaking in Brussels this morning, Soros warned that the UK\u2019s referendum has unleashed a new crisis on Europe. He predicted that the continental banking system will be \u2018severely tested\u2019, at a time when it hasn\u2019t recovered from the eurozone debt crisis. Soros cautioned EU leaders to heed the concerns of UK voters, and not to punish them for last week\u2019s vote. He repeated his call for Germany to drop its opposition to collective eurozone borrowing. And he urged leaders to take advantage of record low borrowing costs, and Europe\u2019s top-ranked AAA credit rating. The refugee crisis poses an existential threat to Europe. It is the height of irresponsibility to allow the EU to disintegate without utilising all its resources. Throughout history, governments have issued bonds in response to national emergencies. When should the EU\u2019s triple-A rating be put to use, if not when the EU is in mortal danger? Here\u2019s a video clip: Ripples from the Brexit vote have reached Singapore. Singapore\u2019s third-biggest lender has temporarily stopped issuing loans on London properties, due to uncertainty over the EU referendum vote. European stock markets are dropping back in early trading, after yesterday\u2019s surprising surge. The main indices are all in the red. The FTSE 100 has dropped by 0.7%, after jumping 3.5% yesterday. In London, Royal Bank of Scotland is leading the selloff, down 5%. Building firms are also dropping back, with Berkeley Group down 3.5%. The pound is also in a state of torpor this morning, hovering around the $1.34 mark. Sterling has struggled to make much recovery after Friday\u2019s record plunge, and hit a 31-year low of $1.31 in Monday. Bank shares have been pummelled since the referendum result, including Virgin Money\u2019s which at one point had lost 30% of its value. The bank\u2019s boss Jayne-Anne Gadhia has told BBC Radio 4 Today programme that sentiment should improve. She said regulators had made banks stronger, well capitalised and highly liquid since the 2008 crisis. And she also played down the impact of low interest rates on banks saying a strong economy was more important. \u201cPeople should not panic,\u201d she said, and keep moving home, adding: \u201cPost-Brexit we should all get together and have confidence about the future.\u201d A rallying cry? Sir Richard Branson who owns a stake in the bank has been calling for action, and told the Guardian on Tuesday that Chinese investors are pulling out of investment. When the going gets tough, you need a tough central banker to step in. So Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, is going to do his best to prevent last week\u2019s Brexit vote triggering a financial crisis. Carney will give a speech at 4pm BST today, and we\u2019re expecting him to reassure investors and the public that the Bank\u2019s contingency measures are working. He\u2019ll also be quizzed by reporters about the impact of the EU referendum on the UK economy, and its implications for growth and monetary policy. Analysts at Royal Bank of Canada say Carney\u2019s speech will be closely watched in the City, and beyond: In the UK the main event for markets is likely to be a hastily scheduled speech by Governor Carney with the title \u201cUncertainty, the economy and policy\u201d. This will be at 4pm BST. Given the title of the speech we would anticipate getting some clues on whether our expectation of prompt rate cuts and a QE extension is what the Governor has in mind. Good morning. There\u2019s an eerie calm in the financial markets this morning. After a week of wild, referendum-fuelled moves, traders are taking a breather while they wonder how the Brexit saga will play out. Shares are dipping in early trading, but there\u2019s no repeat of the recent volatility (yet, anyway) Yesterday, the dear old FTSE 100 shrugged off its fears and surged by 219 points, or 3.5%. That means it has clawed back all its losses since the referendum result rocked Europe... ... however, it\u2019s not as simple as that. The Footsie is priced in sterling, which is still close to its 31-year lows. So price the index in dollars, and we\u2019re still way down. The real drama today will be in Westminster, not the City, with nominations for the Conservative party leadership closing at noon, and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn facing a leadership challenge from Angela Eagle. But European markets will still be gripped by the unfolding consequences of the Brexit vote, which could hurt growth and harm companies across the region. Banks are under particular pressure, especially in Italy, due to fears of a flurry of bad debts if the economy turns sour. They also face the prospect of record low interest rates for even longer, eating into profitability. Also coming up today: Senior financial figures are gathering at a conference organised by TheCityUK - Brexit will surely be high on the agenda... At 9.30am BST, we get the final estimate of UK growth in the last quarter. It\u2019ll probably confirm that the economy expanded by 0.4% in January-March \u2013 but that\u2019s all history now. The latest Eurozone inflation figures are due at 10am BST, which may show that prices were flat last month.",

But he erred on the side of supporting growth with lower borrowing costs.</p> <p>\u201cIn my view, and I am not prejudging the views of the other independent MPC members, the economic outlook has deteriorated and some monetary policy easing will likely be required over the summer,\u201d Carney said in the speech to bankers and business leaders.</p> <p>\u201cThe committee will make an initial assessment on 14 July and a full assessment complete with a new forecast will follow in the August inflation report.

If he slashes them to zero, then the mortgage costs drops to \u00a3636. </p> <p>The impact is even bigger if the borrower has an interest-only mortgage, although these have largely disappeared since the credit crunch. They would see the cost of servicing a \u00a3150,000 loan drop from \u00a3313 a month to \u00a3281 at base rate of 0.25%, dropping to \u00a3250 once rates hit zero. </p> <p>Anyone on a fixed-rate mortgage will see no change.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "European plane maker Airbus is to install technology built by British firm Inmarsat that will render the black box virtually obsolete and could prevent air disasters. Inmarsat, the satellite company that helped Malaysia Airlines pinpoint the likely flight path of the downed MH370 airliner, said the technology was a \u201cgamechanger\u201d for airline safety. It beams flight information via a satellite to an airline\u2019s control centre within seconds, capturing real-time data about what is happening onboard the plane. This is particularly important if an aeroplane crashes into the sea, because signals sent by a flight recorder, or black box, typically stop within weeks as its batteries run down. This leaves investigators unable to access crucial data about the cause of an accident, as in the case of MH370, whose black box has yet to be found. Inmarsat said the new technology \u2013 called SwiftBroadband-Safety (SB-S) and dubbed the \u201cblack box in the cloud\u201d \u2013 could prevent a crash by speeding up communication between the cockpit and the ground in the event of a mechanical problem or terrorist incident. Airbus will fit SB-S technology in A320 single-aisle planes and A330 wide-body aircraft from 2018 if it gets regulatory approval. British defence firm Cobham was selected by Airbus to build the onboard equipment that will be fitted on the planes and connected to Inmarsat\u2019s satellite network. A former pilot, captain Mary McMillan, who is Inmarsat\u2019s head of safety, said SB-S technology could not only help identify the cause of accidents but could even prevent them. \u201cThis is a gamechanger for safety,\u201d said McMillan, a 30-year veteran of the aviation industry with more than 12,000 hours of flight time under her belt. \u201cI was flying on 9/11 and the difficulty of getting information back and forth was one of the issues of that time. \u201cThere is a limited capability for aircraft to stream data depending on links they are using. The difference in being able to send a small amount of data is you have to pick and choose what you send. \u201cThe ability to stream large amounts of data will give us an awareness in real time of a developing situation about what\u2019s taking place on an aircraft.\u201d She said the technology could allow staff on the ground to intervene to prevent an accident, \u201cwhether it\u2019s a response to a mechanical problem or a terrorist situation\u201d. Aircraft are already capable of sending live information, but the data is often incomplete and takes longer to send due to slow speeds. Inmarsat said SB-S was a \u201cparadigm shift\u201d in aviation safety \u201cdue to its unprecedented speed and capacity, which are several orders of magnitude greater than cockpit communications systems in the market today\u201d. Industry sources said Hawaiian Airlines has already tested the SB-S technology and that it has worked well. Inmarsat was instrumental in determining the flight path of MH370, which crashed on 8 March 2014 with 239 on board while flying from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. The cause of the crash has never been identified, leaving air safety firms, pilots and conspiracy theorists to speculate on the events leading up to its disappearance.",

The difference in being able to send a small amount of data is you have to pick and choose what you send.</p> <p>\u201cThe ability to stream large amounts of data will give us an awareness in real time of a developing situation about what\u2019s taking place on an aircraft.\u201d</p> <p>She said the technology could allow staff on the ground to intervene to prevent an accident, \u201cwhether it\u2019s a response to a mechanical problem or a terrorist situation\u201d.</p> <p>Aircraft are already capable of sending live information, but the data is often incomplete and takes longer to send due to slow speeds.</p> <p>Inmarsat said SB-S was a \u201cparadigm shift\u201d in aviation safety \u201cdue to its unprecedented speed and capacity, which are several orders of magnitude greater than cockpit communications systems in the market today\u201d.</p> <p>Industry sources said Hawaiian Airlines has already tested the SB-S technology and that it has worked well.</p> <p>Inmarsat was instrumental in determining the flight path of MH370, which crashed on 8 March 2014 with 239 on board while flying from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.</p> <p>The cause of the crash has never been identified, leaving air safety firms, pilots and conspiracy theorists to speculate on the events leading up to its disappearance.</p>",

John McFarlane, who is also chairman of TheCityUK, which promotes Britain\u2019s financial services, said it was important not to lose sight of Europe as a market as businesses sought to build broader international links. \u201cRelationships with the EU will need to be repaired,\u201d he told TheCityUK\u2019s annual conference. \u201cWe can only hope that whatever transpires will be to the benefit of our membership.\u201d His comments preceded a meeting of business leaders at No 10 with David Cameron and business secretary Sajid Javid to allay concerns that the political crisis enveloping both major UK political parties would spill over into the economy and trigger a recession. Carolyn McCall, the chief executive of easyJet, who attended the meeting, has already warned that quitting Europe will drive up air fares and make holidays more expensive. The prime minister reportedly told business leaders it was important that businesses did not become \u201cfixated\u201d on the EU, but looked to markets beyond to generate new relationships and sales. McFarlane told the conference: \u201cIt\u2019s far from certain what we might be able to secure from discussions with the EU.\u201d However, he said London was the financial centre for Europe and could remain that way. \u201cEurope\u2019s capital markets are not in Frankfurt, Paris or Dublin; they are in London,\u201d he said, adding that English would continue to be the language of business. Britain is not expected to begin negotiations with Brussels until autumn at the earliest, and possibly not until next year, after a new prime minister has been chosen. Talks to reach a deal on new trading terms are scheduled to take at least two years. Douglas Flint, the chairman of HSBC, Britain\u2019s biggest bank, said bankers should be wary of making demands in the wake of the vote, which he described as a rejection of the \u201cexpert class\u201d. Making it clear that the bank would maintain its headquarters in London, he told the conference there would be no return to light-touch regulation, although negotiations with the EU could offer an opportunity to recalibrate some rules. Flint said the fact that the markets functioned well this week, despite volumes surging to six times normal levels, showed that the regulatory changes since the 2008 financial crisis had left the UK\u2019s financial system in robust shape. After British banking stocks were hammered in the wake of the Brexit vote last week, Harriett Baldwin, a junior finance minister, sought to reassure the City of London, pointing out that banks maintain large reserves and the Bank of England was ready to take action. \u201cFinancial markets are capable of weathering challenges, they adapt quickly and they find new opportunities,\u201d she said.",

Al Mana Group, based in Doha, has bought BHS\u2019s 70 overseas stores as administrator Duff &amp; Phelps continues to negotiate the future of 164 UK outlets. Up to 11,000 jobs remain at risk in the UK, with hopes fading of securing a buyer for a large chunk of the chain as a going concern. All the stores continue to trade, but are running closing down sales while administrators continue to negotiate with potential buyers. Industry insiders said it was unlikely that administrators would be able to find a buyer for more than 50 of the group\u2019s UK stores, although there is thought to have been interest from the likes of Sports Direct and Primark. The deal with Al Mana is likely to be good news for up to 150 workers in the UK linked to website operations, and potentially for creditors owed more than \u00a31bn when BHS went into administration. Unsecured creditors, including thousands of suppliers, were told last week that they were likely to get less than 3p for every \u00a31 they are owed. However, it is not clear how much Al Mana, which runs stores for Harvey Nichols, Zara and Mango in the Middle East, paid for BHS\u2019s overseas assets. The biggest creditor remains the state-owned Pension Protection Fund (PPF), which is lined up to take on the \u00a3571m deficit in BHS\u2019s pension fund unless a rescue deal can be secured. The group\u2019s former owner Sir Philip Green, who sold BHS for \u00a31 in March 2015 to a consortium led by Dominic Chappell, who had previously been declared bankrupt, is in the process of trying to reach an agreement to keep BHS\u2019s pension scheme out of the pensions lifeboat. The collapse of BHS in April has led to several inquiries and Green being called before MPs to explain how the business had been left in such a perilous state. The tycoon, who together with other investors collected more than \u00a3580m in dividends, rent and interest payments from BHS during his 15 years in charge of the retailer, told MPs that he would \u201cgive assurance to the 20,000 pensioners that I am here to sort [the pension deficit] in the correct way.\u201d Last week, the PPF backed the appointment of a second administrator, FRP Advisory, to assist with investigations into the behaviour of former BHS directors.",

    "webTitle": "Cadbury and Oreo-maker Mondelez reportedly making bid to buy Hershey's", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "For a few hours, it looked like Big Chocolate was about to get even bigger: according to reports, Mondelez, the multi-billion dollar company behind Cadbury\u2019s, Oreo and some of the world\u2019s biggest brands, made a bid for Pennsylvania-based American chocolatier The Hershey Company. On Thursday the Wall Street Journal reported that snack food titan Mondelez had submitted a bid for Hershey\u2019s, a bid that would have created the world\u2019s largest candy company and give the company several major brand names to add to a portfolio that already includes Chips Ahoy, C\u00f4te d\u2019Or, Toblerone and many others. Hershey\u2019s makes Kit Kat, Reese\u2019s, Almond Joy, its namesake candy bars and many other chocolate confections. By the afternoon, Hershey\u2019s had said no deal: \u201c[T]he board of directors of the Company unanimously rejected the indication of interest and determined that it provided no basis for further discussion between Mondel\u0113z and the Company,\u201d said the company in a public statement. The offer was for $107 per Hershey\u2019s share; news of the bid sent the stock price to $117. It stayed high even after news of the rejection. The deal would have merged the British and American distribution and manufacturing arms of the Cadbury chocolate company, which Mondelez purchased in 2009, when it was a part of Kraft, after management acquiesced to a hostile takeover bid. Hershey\u2019s currently produces and distributes Cadbury chocolates in the United States. The rumour sparked a rise in the market value of Hershey\u2019s, which rose from $21bn to $24bn. Mondelez is currently worth about $69bn. Hershey\u2019s shares didn\u2019t entirely erase their gains suggesting that investors believe a deal could yet get done. Any deal would depend on regulatory approval, as well as the blessing of the Hershey Trust, which controls 81% of shareholder voting power. Hershey\u2019s had an inauspicious 2015: shares fell by 15% and missed earnings estimates for the first two quarters of the year, in part because the company\u2019s Chinese businesses underperformed, notably Golden Monkey Food Company in Shanghai, which Hershey bought in 2013. The trust itself, which has opposed acquisitions in the past, is a troubled entity: in May, the attorney general of Pennsylvania demanded resignations from three members of its 10-person board over misuse of funds. The Hershey Trust controls some $12bn and administers the Hershey School, an institution for poor children, funds from which were allegedly used to purchase a golf course in 2013. Mondelez divested itself of its grocery businesses in 2012 \u2013 when the firm was still called Kraft Foods \u2013 under shareholder pressure, and now focuses entirely on snack foods. The spun-off company, which kept the Kraft name, has since merged with Heinz, while Mondelez divested itself of a minority stake in coffee company Douwe Egbert in 2015 for $5bn.

      "body": "<p>For a few hours, it looked like Big Chocolate was about to get even bigger: according to reports, Mondelez, the multi-billion dollar company behind Cadbury\u2019s, Oreo and some of the world\u2019s biggest brands, made a bid for Pennsylvania-based American chocolatier The Hershey Company. </p> <p>On Thursday the <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/mondelez-makes-takeover-bid-for-hershey-1467297248\">Wall Street Journal</a> reported that snack food titan Mondelez had submitted a bid for Hershey\u2019s, a bid that would have created the world\u2019s largest candy company and give the company several major brand names to add to a portfolio that already includes Chips Ahoy, C\u00f4te d\u2019Or, Toblerone and many others. Hershey\u2019s makes Kit Kat, Reese\u2019s, Almond Joy, its namesake candy bars and many other chocolate confections.</p> <p>By the afternoon, Hershey\u2019s had said no deal: \u201c[T]he board of directors of the Company unanimously rejected the indication of interest and determined that it provided no basis for further discussion between Mondel\u0113z and the Company,\u201d said the company in <a href=\"http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20160630006177/en/Board-Directors-Hershey-Company-Unanimously-Rejected-Preliminary\">a public statement</a>. The offer was for $107 per Hershey\u2019s share; news of the bid sent the stock price to $117. It stayed high even after news of the rejection.</p> <p>The deal would have merged the British and American distribution and manufacturing arms of the Cadbury chocolate company, which Mondelez purchased in 2009, when it was a part of Kraft, after management acquiesced to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/jan/19/cadbury-board-agrees-kraft-sale\">a hostile takeover bid</a>. Hershey\u2019s currently produces and distributes Cadbury chocolates in the United States.</p> <p>The rumour sparked a rise in the market value of Hershey\u2019s, which rose from $21bn to $24bn. Mondelez is currently worth about $69bn. Hershey\u2019s shares didn\u2019t entirely erase their gains suggesting that investors believe a deal could yet get done.</p> <p>Any deal would depend on regulatory approval, as well as the blessing of the Hershey Trust, which controls 81% of shareholder voting power.</p> <p>Hershey\u2019s had an inauspicious 2015: shares fell by 15% and missed earnings estimates for the first two quarters of the year, in part because the company\u2019s Chinese businesses underperformed, notably Golden Monkey Food Company in Shanghai, which Hershey <a href=\"http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20131218006487/en/Hershey-Enters-Agreement-Acquire-Majority-Share-Shanghai\">bought in 2013</a>. </p> <p>The trust itself, which has opposed acquisitions in the past, is a troubled entity: in May, the attorney general of Pennsylvania <a href=\"http://articles.philly.com/2016-05-04/news/72807966_1_hershey-charity-hershey-school-hershey-trust-co+\">demanded resignations</a> from three members of its 10-person board over misuse of funds. The Hershey Trust controls some $12bn and administers the Hershey School, an institution for poor children, funds from which were allegedly used to purchase a golf course in 2013.</p> <p>Mondelez divested itself of its grocery businesses in 2012 \u2013 when the firm was still called Kraft Foods \u2013 under shareholder pressure, and now focuses entirely on snack foods. The spun-off company, which kept the Kraft name, has since merged with Heinz, while Mondelez divested itself of a minority stake in coffee company Douwe Egbert in 2015 for $5bn. Now, it appears the company has returned to acquisitions.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20151028/NEWS07/151029816/mondelez-sending-white-collar-jobs-overseas\">Mondelez\u2019s strategy of reshoring American jobs</a> overseas in order to improve margins has been among the business decisions at issue in a presidential election season with an unusually strong focus on trade.

Britain\u2019s largest trade union, Unite, which represents 450 of the company\u2019s 2,000-strong workforce, called for more clarity before a meeting with the management next month. \u201cUnite recognises that Bernard Matthews is in a very competitive marketplace, with profit margins being squeezed,\u201d said the regional officer Steve Harley. \u201cThis issue is one for the management\u2019s marketing and sales team to address as a matter of urgency. \u201cIt is a worrying time for our members, and we will be seeking clarity on what this means for the company and the workers when we meet management on Friday 15 July.\u201d Unite\u2019s members are based at the company\u2019s production sites at Great Witchingham in Norfolk and Holton in Suffolk, and at its animal food mill at Bawsey, near King\u2019s Lynn. In an email to staff earlier this week, Rutland Partners\u2019 executive chairman, Alan Jamieson, said the accountancy firm PricewaterhouseCoopers had been appointed to find a buyer for the business. \u201cThis does not affect the internal operation of the business,\u201d he told staff. \u201cNeither does it reduce in any way Rutland\u2019s support for the BM management team as it continues to strengthen and improve the business following the disappointing results achieved over the last year or so.\u201d Rutland Partners, which also owns Pizza Hut and the electronics chain Maplin, bought Bernard Matthews, Europe\u2019s largest turkey producer, in 2013.

      "bodyText": "Britons spooked by the shock vote to leave the EU are ditching plans to buy homes, putting big purchases on ice, and looking for work abroad. The panic triggered in financial markets following Britain\u2019s decision to quit the EU has started to ripple down to everyday decision-making, as consumers brace themselves for sustained uncertainty. Estate Agent Haart said there was an 11% rise in the number of people pulling out of property deals at the weekend compared with the final weekend of June 2015. Searches for jobs in other countries spiked in the immediate aftermath of the decision, with Ireland a popular alternative to the UK, as well as the US and Australia, according to jobs site Indeed. Meanwhile, a survey conducted both before and after the poll by YouGov and Cebr revealed a crash in consumer confidence after the shock result was announced. Scott Corfe, a director at Cebr, said households had been \u201chighly spooked\u201d, with the mood expected to weigh on retail sales and spending on big ticket items. A separate survey by Retail Economics found that more than a third of people were planning to cut back on large purchases such as holidays, televisions, bathrooms, and furniture. Guardian readers have been in touch to describe what impact the Brexit decision is already having on their lives. One reader from Oxfordshire who did not want to be named said his family had abandoned plans to build their own home and were braced for years of financial struggle. He said: \u201cWe have cancelled plans to buy a plot to build our own house, we are wishing we hadn\u2019t already booked an expensive European holiday, which we had taken out a loan to pay for. And we are uncertain about whether to take out a new fixed rate mortgage on our house now that we are unlikely to be selling it to pay for the build. \u201cWe will be returning to the \u2018survival mode\u2019 approach to spending that we took following the banking crash, as we expect years of financial struggle ahead.\u201d An IT consultant from Dorset, who also did not want to be named, said the company he worked for had cancelled plans to hire 30 new staff and a customer in Germany had postponed a \u20ac130m (\u00a3108m) contract. He said that spending on IT was often one of the first things to be cut by companies in times of economic uncertainty, because much of it was discretionary rather than essential. \u201cDecisions are being postponed. This happened massively during the financial crisis and it\u2019s happening again. We have reduced UK sales forecasts by 15% purely because of Brexit.\u201d Another Guardian reader from Milton Keynes said that plans to buy a property in Spain had fallen through. \u201cWe will probably never be able to afford a property in Spain again,\u201d he said. Haart said new listings from people selling homes were down by 3.9% last weekend compared with the same weekend a year earlier, while calls into branches were 7% below the trend for the three weeks in the run-up to the vote. The firm, which has more than 100 branches across England, said that it had seen an increasing number of people booking valuations \u201cto understand what effect there has been\u201d. Charles Perdios, who runs estate agency Anthony Pepe in north London, said some sales had fallen through since the weekend. \u201cOne was a lady who pulled out of a sale because her job was funded by the EU, so she was directly affected by the result,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have had a couple of people saying they\u2019re going to take their houses off the market and wait now.\u201d Perdios said on Friday morning there was a flurry of calls from would-be buyers \u201ctrying their luck\u201d with offers up to 15% below asking price, although these had not been accepted. Some other deals had been renegotiated following the decision: \u201cWe have negotiated a few down. We are expecting 20% fewer transactions in the second half of the year than we expected before.\u201d David Hollingworth of mortgage broker London &amp; Country saidborrowers have been pulling out of purchases. \u201cThere are some who are quite early on in the process, who haven\u2019t spent money on solicitors or surveys, who do not feel wedded to a property, who have decided to wait and see what happens rather than going ahead,\u201d he said. Research published by the National Association of Estate Agents (NAEA) showed that before the vote demand for property had already fallen to a three-year low. Mark Hayward, managing director of the NAEA, said: \u201cAlthough in the short term, we believe that house prices will remain stable, we cannot be certain about the next quarter as political uncertainty and market unrest could affect the housing market.\u201d On the parenting forum Mumsnet, people shared concerns about going ahead with house purchases, spending money on extensions, and the sort of reception they might receive when holidaying within the EU. One prospective home buyer wrote: \u201cFrom all the data, it looks like we will be buying at what would be a peak. I am getting very nervous now about a crash ... Should we pull out? Please help me to get some perspective here.\u201d Abta, which represents UK travel agents and tour operators, said it was \u201ctoo soon to tell\u201d what impact Brexit would have on the industry. A spokeswoman said: \u201cPeople due to travel this summer will see little changes to their holiday. However, the fall in value of the pound will have an immediate impact on holidaymakers and their spending power overseas.\u201d Holiday group Thomas Cook said that it was focused on business as usual. \u201cAt this early stage the implications of the UK vote to leave the EU are still unclear,\u201d a spokeswoman said. She added: \u201cLike other UK-listed companies we will of course be monitoring events very closely over the coming days and months and we will provide updates on any developments as they become clear.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "While we watch the reactions to Brexit ripple their way through financial markets and speculate about the magnitude of the economic fallout, there\u2019s only one certainty: central banks can\u2019t do much to help and politicians are in the driving seat. From Tokyo to London, central bankers have cut interest rates to record lows and employed quantitative easing programs, unconventional ways of flooding the markets with money by buying up government debt or other securities. At best, this costly and complex strategy has succeeded in getting growth back to at least anemic levels; at worst, hasn\u2019t done much of anything. The European Central Bank had hoped to begin scaling back its nearly $2bn quantitative easing program; that no longer looks feasible. And so, gulp, the future of the global economy is back in the hands of the politicians, however terrifying that prospect may sound. \u201cOne of the reasons for the massive voter dissatisfaction is that after the financial crisis and the recession, central banks were left to fill the policy void as stalemates gripped Congress and Parliament,\u201d says Jack Ablin, chief investment officer of BMO Wealth Management. Those stalemates still exist, but monetary policymakers have simply run out of tools. They can\u2019t keep cutting interest rates; those are at zero or near zero. In some markets, like Japan, savers are penalized by being charged for depositing money, while borrowers are rewarded by being paid: a topsy-turvy situation known as a negative interest rate scenario. Meanwhile, quantitative easing hasn\u2019t produced much in the way of economic growth; the US gross domestic product hasn\u2019t grown at an annual rate of more than 2.5% since the recession. In fact, Michael Hartnett, chief investment strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, calculated that the world\u2019s central banks have flooded markets with $12.3tn of new money, cut interest rates 654 times and ensured that there are $10tn worth of bonds worldwide that now trade with negative interest rates since the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008. The result? Astonishingly lackluster economic growth \u2013 and a blockbuster stock market. That combination has been a toxic one, and it has fed the political discontent that produced the Brexit result and contributed to the protest candidacies of both Bernie Sanders (on the left) and Donald Trump (on the right). The two US presidential candidates shared one important appeal to voters: their argument that the current economic system is broken, and that it\u2019s up to politicians to step in and fix it. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, laid out his views explicitly in an economic policy speech on Tuesday, blaming globalization and free trade for many of the economic woes that American workers are experiencing. If elected, he says, he\u2019d confine US trade deals to bilateral arrangements, scrapping multilateral arrangements like the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). Whether Trump\u2019s protectionist proposals are the correct ones to pursue is almost a secondary question at this point. The first order of business is to get politicians to understand that they have abdicated their responsibility for economic policy for too long, and that the consequences have proved devastating. Consider economic inequality, for instance. Allowing the central bankers to maintain the sole responsibility for providing a post-financial crisis \u201cfix\u201d created a boom in the financial markets. The value of financial assets rose, thanks to rock-bottom interest rates and the Fed\u2019s quantitative easing. Ablin notes that those years just served as the last bit of icing on the cake. Between 1979 and 2014, wages grew 230%, more or less keeping pace with inflation. (Incidentally, he points out, the price of a boat more or less grew by the same amount.) But the stock market return over the same period of time was a whopping 5,300%. The result? Any of us who make our money in the shape of wages and salaries plodded along. Those able to earn significantly more and who could invest, and/or who made money from investments, ended up on the other side of an ever wider, ever deeper wealth gap, one that monetary policymakers at central banks just made wider because their tools couldn\u2019t address inequality. For that, politicians would have had to act. And as anyone who has been watching Congress in the last few years knows all too well, that just hasn\u2019t been happening. What is needed now is for those politicians to look at the Brexit results, and shake in their shoes. Whether they fear the economic fallout, or the anger of voters, something should galvanize them to take action, and contemplate any one of a number of policies that could complement or even supplant central bank action. Tax reform would be one place to start. Find a way to encourage corporations to invest in research and development, and to hire, rather than to simply boost dividends and share buybacks, putting still more money into the hands of already wealthy shareholders on the \u201cwrong\u201d side of the wealth gap. Politicians will have to find ways to address the conundrum that while global trade does bring about growth, it hurts the people who used to make the products that are now being traded, like T-shirts and auto parts. They can\u2019t move to China to make products for Apple, or to Bangladesh to work in sweatshops there, nor can they compete on the basis of the wages paid to people in those countries. And the jobs that are created instead of what once were professional, unionized, blue-collar manufacturing jobs are low-paying service positions: working in restaurants and retail outlets. Sometimes workers earn only minimum wage and may not even land full-time hours. Simply banning global trade or trying to turn back the clock won\u2019t fix this \u2013 how many consumers will buy a $40 T-shirt? \u2013 so it will be up to the now-despised political \u201celites\u201d to find another solution. It\u2019s a problem that\u2019s well beyond the scope of central bankers, and if it\u2019s not fixed, it just doesn\u2019t matter how low interest rates fall. \u201cShould the elites choose to acknowledge issues like inequality, they could find ways to address them in ways that aren\u2019t economically self-destructive,\u201d argues Jeff Kleintop, chief global investment strategist at Charles Schwab. That doesn\u2019t mean that they won\u2019t hurt Wall Street, of course. Ablin points out that the cost of any policies that raise incomes and reduce shareholder profits would leave investors dissatisfied, and could eat away at stock market returns, at least in the short term. Top-line revenue growth could alter that down the road, of course. Moreover, it\u2019s not as if Wall Street is finding the status quo profitable or reassuring, so it may be a choice between the lesser of two evils. \u201cFor years, fiscal policy gridlock was acceptable to Wall Street, because they could turn to monetary policy, which rewarded investors \u2013 but now that\u2019s no longer an option. The only alternative is some kind of growth policy from the politicians,\u201d Ablin says. If that\u2019s true, we\u2019d better hope that our current crop of elected politicians cease embracing Thoreau\u2019s conviction that the government that governs best, governs least.",

    "webTitle": "UK current account deficit deepens Brexit fears", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s trading position with the rest of the world was much worse than feared in the opening months of this year, intensifying concerns about how the economy will fare outside the EU. The current account deficit narrowed only slightly in the first quarter from the record reached in the previous three months, data from the Office for National Statistics showed. The figures also confirmed that the economy slowed in the first quarter and grew more slowly than previously thought in 2015, adding to the gloom amid warnings that Britain is on the brink of recession following the Brexit vote. Against that backdrop, the ONS further revised its assessment of the great recession of 2008-09 to show it was a little deeper than previously estimated, at 6.3%. The current account deficit reflects Britain\u2019s trade gap with the rest of the world and the shortfall between money paid out by the UK and money coming in. It stood at 6.9% of GDP in the first quarter of 2016, down only marginally from a record high of 7.2% in the fourth quarter of 2015. The deficit remained much wider than economists had been expecting. It stood at \u00a332.59bn in the first quarter, compared with an upwardly revised \u00a333.96bn the previous three months. Economists polled by Reuters had expected the current account gap to narrow to \u00a327.1bn. Howard Archer, economist at the consultancy IHS Global Insight, described the first quarter shortfall as \u201chighly uncomfortable\u201d. \u201cThere is a substantial danger that the UK will find it increasingly hard to attract the inward flows of capital needed to finance the current account deficit, particularly given its recent credit rating downgrades and the very real possibility of more to come,\u201d Archer said. \u201cThis could potentially trigger a sterling crisis and it will also make the Bank of England\u2019s task more complicated on the interest rate front.\u201d Ahead of the referendum on EU membership, the Bank of England had highlighted Britain\u2019s record current account gap and noted that the UK relies on foreign investors to fund the shortfall. The governor, Mark Carney, expressed concern that in the event of a vote to leave the EU, foreign investors would become more nervous about buying, or holding, UK assets. Since last week\u2019s referendum result, which prompted a sharp drop in the pound and turmoil on stock markets, Carney emphasised that the central bank will do all it can. He is expected to use a speech later on Thursday to try to calm fears that Britain\u2019s financial system could experience a shock and to say that the Bank\u2019s contingency plans have kept funds flowing in the City and bolstered business confidence. Markets have stabilised in the past two days, and in mid-morning trading on Thursday the FTSE 100 was up 0.4% on the day at 6,387. The pound was 0.3% higher against the dollar at just under $1.3460. But analysts say there could be more wild swings to come as Britain\u2019s future trading relationships remain unclear and an early general election looms. There have been signs that uncertainty is already denting the real economy, with business deals cancelled, firms saying they may freeze hiring and consumer confidence down. A poll for YouGov found that consumer confidence dived in the five days since the referendum as concerns grew about house prices and the likelihood of being made redundant. That drop in sentiment threatens to hit consumer spending, which is heavily relied upon to drive growth in Britain\u2019s unbalanced economy. Growth by sector The latest figures on GDP growth confirmed that picture. Manufacturing and construction output fell in the first quarter but there was continued growth for the much larger services sector \u2013 the only part of UK economy to have regained its pre-crisis strength. That services expansion helped the economy grow 0.4% in the first quarter, down from 0.7% in the fourth quarter of 2015. The ONS chief economist, Joe Grice, said there was \u201cvery little evidence of a \u2018referendum effect\u2019 in the data\u201d, though he pointed out that the vote was not called until more than halfway through the quarter. The ONS revised its figures for 2015 as a whole to show GDP growth slowed to 2.2% from 2.3%. The statistics office also said the recession during the global financial crisis was deeper than previously thought. GDP fell by 6.3% from the peak in first quarter of 2008 to the trough in the second quarter of 2009, compared with a previous estimate of 6.1%. For the first quarter of this year, the ONS said GDP per head \u2013 seen as a better reflection of people\u2019s economic well-being than total GDP \u2013 increased 0.3%, slower than the growth in the overall economy. GDP per head is now 0.9% above pre-economic downturn levels while overall GDP is 7% higher. The ONS also released figures on income inequality, which has come into greater focus following the referendum amid a view that for many voters their support for leaving the EU reflected the struggle with household finances and job insecurity.

The governor, Mark Carney, expressed concern that in the event of a vote to leave the EU, foreign investors would become more nervous about buying, or holding, UK assets.</p> <p>Since last week\u2019s referendum result, which prompted a sharp drop in the pound and turmoil on stock markets, Carney emphasised that the central bank will do all it can. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/30/mark-carney-expected-to-calm-fears-for-financial-markets-bank-of-england\">He is expected to use a speech later on Thursday to try to calm fears that Britain\u2019s financial system could experience a shock</a> and to say that the Bank\u2019s contingency plans have kept funds flowing in the City and bolstered business confidence.</p> <p>Markets have stabilised in the past two days, and in mid-morning trading on Thursday the FTSE 100 was up 0.4% on the day at 6,387. The pound was 0.3% higher against the dollar at just under $1.3460.</p> <p>But analysts say there could be more wild swings to come as Britain\u2019s future trading relationships remain unclear and an early general election looms. </p> <p>There have been signs that uncertainty is already denting the real economy, with business deals cancelled, firms saying they may freeze hiring and consumer confidence down. A poll for YouGov found that consumer confidence dived in the five days since the referendum as concerns grew about house prices and the likelihood of being made redundant. That drop in sentiment threatens to hit consumer spending, which is heavily relied upon to drive growth in Britain\u2019s unbalanced economy.</p> <h2>Growth by sector</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1d96d82898cb75a8418676ca6ebb4e94e39d27c8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1d96d82898cb75a8418676ca6ebb4e94e39d27c8/0_0_800_443/500.jpg\" alt=\"UK GDP quarterly average compound growth by industry.\" width=\"500\" height=\"277\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">UK GDP quarterly average compound growth by industry.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Office for National Statistics</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The latest figures on GDP growth confirmed that picture.

The ONS chief economist, Joe Grice, said there was \u201cvery little evidence of a \u2018referendum effect\u2019 in the data\u201d, though he pointed out that the vote was not called until more than halfway through the quarter. </p> <p>The ONS revised its figures for 2015 as a whole to show GDP growth slowed to 2.2% from 2.3%. The statistics office also said the recession during the global financial crisis was deeper than previously thought.

United Overseas Bank said it would \u201ctemporarily stop\u201d issuing the loans because of heightened uncertainty following the Brexit decision. \u201cAs the aftermath of the UK referendum is still unfolding and given the uncertainties, we need to ensure our customers are cautious with their London property investments,\u201d a spokeswoman said.

Tok Geok Peng, an executive director for consumer lending at DBS Bank, said: \u201cFor customers interested in buying properties in London, we would advise them to assess the situation carefully before committing to their purchases as there could be potential foreign exchange and sovereign risks.\u201d Britain\u2019s decision to leave the EU has sent shockwaves around the world, hitting global markets in the immediate aftermath of the result and putting policymakers on high alert for a renewed economic downturn. International banks are once again under the spotlight following the deep financial crisis that erupted in 2008 when the collapse of US investment bank Lehman Brothers brought the global economy to the brink. Investors are also fearful that Brexit will trigger a new property crash, as lower growth and higher uncertainty depress demand. A number of high-profile deals in the commercial property sector are now in doubt, according to the trade publication Property Week, with buyers expected to try to renegotiate on price. A \u00a3200m bid for Mulberry\u2019s flagship store on New Bond Street in London\u2019s West End is under review by Oxford Properties and joint partners Crown Acquisitions and Swiss luxury retailer Richemont, the magazine said. Other deals at risk include the sale of Cannon Place in the City of London for about \u00a3465m, and the \u00a3190m acquisition of 1 Wood Street, also in the City. Brexit jitters have hit the housing market, with buyers pulling out of deals immediately after the result was announced on Friday. Estate agent Haart said there was an 11% rise in the number of people ditching property deals at the weekend compared with the final weekend of June 2015. In the run-up to the referendum, the head of the International Monetary Fund warned of a housing market crash if Britain voted to leave the UK. The pound has fallen since the shock result, particularly against the dollar. A weaker pound makes British goods and services cheaper for overseas buyers, potentially boosting tourism. Searches by people in China for UK holidays \u201cskyrocketed\u201d after news of the Brexit decision broke, travel company Ctrip.com International said. British luxury brands and goods, such as Burberry trench coats and Mulberry bags, are highly popular among China\u2019s swelling middle classes. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see Chinese and Middle Eastern tourists flocking to the UK as their purchasing value has increased,\u201d said Edouard Meylan, chief executive officer of Swiss watchmaker H. Moser &amp; Cie. \u201cPeople are ready to travel to get a five to 10 to 20% discount,\u201d he told Bloomberg.",

      "bodyText": "One of the problems with an election campaign is whenever talk turns to fragility in the economy the solution presented is always one of stability. The government has sought to present itself as stable (after all, it has nearly been a year since it has changed its leader and treasurer), while the ALP sought to present itself as the stable party, given its role during the global financial crisis. And yet both sides were not all that eager to talk about what they would actually do were mere stability not enough to prevent an economic downturn. The lack of eagerness to talk about what they would do is a consequence of the relentless criticism by the Liberal party and sections of the media of the stimulus measures put in place by during the financial crisis, and also the Labor party\u2019s complete inability to use the crisis to challenge the myth that a budget surplus is prime evidence of good economic management. Last Friday, when he rushed with barely disguised joy to speak on ABC\u2019s 7:30 about the impact of the Brexit vote, Malcolm Turnbull dismissed once again the measures undertaken by the Rudd government during the global financial crisis. He told Leigh Sales, that \u201cI think what shepherded Australia through the GFC successfully was the Chinese stimulus and the large amount of cash that John Howard left in the bank\u201d. It requires an odd sense of logic to suggest that the stimulus measures here didn\u2019t work, but that the Chinese ones did. It also is a tad odd to suggest the \u201clarge amount of cash\u201d helped get us through the global financial crisis. Having a surplus does not actually do anything to spur economic growth, it is what you spend the money on that does it. Arguing the surplus got us through the GFC but the stimulus didn\u2019t is a bit like arguing that what brings a smile to your children\u2019s faces on Christmas morning is not the presents you have bought them but the money that was in the bank you had saved in order to buy the presents. Had the stimulus measures been poorly targeted, no amount of surplus would have helped. And the reality is the stimulus measures worked pretty much as they were expected to: In the September and December quarters of 2008, the cash payouts to pensioners and low-income families saw government consumption contribute strongly to GDP growth at a time when household spending was falling. Throughout 2009, the $12.7bn given to all families (the cash splash) saw household consumption contribute very strongly to growth. And while private investment fell in 2009, the public investment through stimulus measures, such as the building the education revolution did the heavy lifting. And once private investment began to improve again \u2013 through both the mining sector and also housing (via the increase in the first-home buyer grant for new properties), government investment tapered off. Add in the performance of exports, and the ability of the RBA to cut rates by 4.25 percentage points in seven months, and you had Australia\u2019s economy continuing to grow while the rest of the world was on the on the floor wondering if anyone got the number of the truck that had just hit it. But after seven years of telling everyone the stimulus measures were a waste that has left Australia \u201cwith a huge structural deficit and of course a mountain of debt\u201d, it means should the Brexit be the nudge that breaks the fragile world economy, there appears little chance that a similar stimulus measure would be pursued. And certainly no side wants to suggest they would engage in stimulus for fear of being seen as reckless spenders. It\u2019s all a bit silly and most likely quite disingenuous. If things go bad, there is no way the RBA can cut rates by enough to really get any decent stimulus, and while we may hope for the dollar to fall (as it also did during the GFC) the problem is most other nations have weaker currencies now than they did seven years ago, so it is likely it won\u2019t fall by enough. And that will \u2013 as ever \u2013 leave us with fiscal stimulus. Stable government sounds great in a sound bite but when the economy is going south, it will be targeted government spending that both sides will pursue regardless of who is in power. And we\u2019d all be hoping it works as well as it did in 2009.",
