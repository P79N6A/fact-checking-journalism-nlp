      "bodyText": "European finance ministers have insisted that Cyprus allows private investigators to check the island's banks for breaches of money-laundering rules ahead of a \u20ac17bn (\u00a314.5bn) rescue deal. The Eurogroup said investigators would be despatched in a matter of days to the capital Nicosia and will report back to its next meeting in March. The move follows allegations that Russian oligarchs have deposited billions of roubles in illegal funds in the island's banks. It was agreed by Cyprus's government despite concerns that the country is rapidly running out of cash. Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Dutch finance minister and head of the Eurogroup, which is comprised of the 17 eurozone members, said the investigation was a precondition for any discussion of the terms of a bailout. \"We have agreed a private firm needs to get involved and we have agreed we need a report in March,\" he said. Dijsselbloem said he was aware that the situation in Cyprus was delicate. But he warned that the terms of the deal could be tightened should breaches of money laundering rules come to light. \"We may need to take extra precautions,\" he said. Olli Rehn, the European Union's head of economic and monetary affairs, defended the delay, saying it was necessary to develop a sustainable rescue package. \"It is a necessary condition that Cyprus complies with the money laundering rules of the EU before we move to discuss the terms of a bailout,\" he said. \"We are working on a solution that aims to satisfy the need for financial sustainability and a comprehensive solution that involves the restructuring and re-financing of the banking sector.\" Fears that Cyprus is home to billions of roubles worth of deposits that has evaded international money laundering regulations have filled the German media in recent weeks as the need for a rescue deal has neared. The country's economy has come under severe strain since it was discovered that its banks made risky loans worth billions of euros ahead of the financial crash. Under pressure to avoid loaning Cyprus funds to protect Russian bank deposits, Berlin has insisted that investors and depositors be forced to sacrifice some of their funds as part of the rescue. According to reports, the so-called bail-in would involve investors and depositors providing up to \u20ac10bn to recapitalise Cyprus's banks, cutting a bill that Brussels estimates will reach \u20ac17bn. The Eurogroup refused to say how much Cyprus' banks will need as part of the rescue deal. Dijsselbloem said all discussions were put on hold until the Eurogroup sees the private investigators' report.

He warned that delays could undo the progress made over the past year in containing the crisis. The ECB boss, Mario Draghi, has also warned against delays to resolving the Cyprus debt package, saying he feared it would undermine confidence in the eurozone at a critical moment. Analysts said the wider rescue of vulnerable European countries could be undermined by a failure to formulate a deal in the next month. Gary Jenkins, managing director of bond-market specialist Swordfish Research, said: \"It might just be that the politicians are annoyed about who may have actually been placing deposits there and would like to fire a warning shot across their bows.

      "bodyText": "As much as \u00a31bn a year of Barclays' annual profits in the years leading up to the banking crisis is believed to have come not from clever investments or banking services but from the prolific and secretive tax avoidance factory at the heart of Barclays' investment banking arm \u2013 much of which is expected to be lined up for closure today. Thanks to a succession of whistleblowers, in 2009 the Guardian was able to uncover the highly lucrative dark arts practiced by Barclays' Structured Capital Markets division. The division created multibillion-pound deals which routed vast amounts of money in elaborate circles through offshore networks \u2013 with the prime purpose of magic-ing profits out of tax credits. Former chancellor Lord Lawson last week described the business as \"industrial scale\" tax avoidance. The company was so alarmed when the Guardian revealed the true nature of its business that it woke a judge in the middle of the night to try to gag the paper and its website. At the time Barclays denied the sums reported but its decision to axe a substantial part of SCM's operations is an admission that much of the unit's activities involved what the bank's new chief executive, Antony, Jenkins now regards as unethical. Jenkins told MPs last week that he was \"shredding\" the legacy of his predecessor Bob Diamond, as he seeks to clean up Barclays' image in the wake of a succession of huge fines and compensation payouts for Libor rigging and insurance mis-selling. An extraordinary culture within the SCM division once allowed tax avoidance not just to thrive but become the engine of Barclays' investment banking's growth. Whistleblowers described to us a management style that depended on fear, summary sackings, ritual humiliations and group social events that outdid any 1980s fictional tales of macho banking excess. The division was run by Roger Jenkins, reported to be paid up to \u00a340m a year, and whose nicknames were Roger the Dodger and The King of the \"Double Dip\" \u2013 a tax avoidance trick that exploited different tax rules in various countries to extract double tax benefits. The brains behind the schemes was said to be Iain Abrahams, a tall Scot with an encyclopaedic knowledge of tax and accounting law. It was common for staff to come in to work to an email from Roger Jenkins announcing that a colleague who had been there the previous day no longer worked for SCM. On one occasion a secretary was said to have been fired for booking an executive a taxi that was a Volvo rather than an S class Mercedes. Team-building events included free-flowing champagne and cigars, poker games involving hundreds of thousands of pounds in bets and a \"motivation\" exercise in which an executive was strapped to a mock electric chair to the soundtrack of a rap song with the line \"I hate you and I hope you die\". Executives would regularly join tax avoidance experts from other banks for a \"cow-eating\" club to eat and drink to excess. Barclays SCM was regarded as the leader of the pack. The banking crash revealed cracks in the highly artificial money-making machine. Confidential documents were leaked to The Guardian and the Liberal Democrats in 2009, which contained the blueprints for the almost incomprehensibly complex accounting and legal structures behind several multibillion-pound tax avoidance deals. When the Guardian published them on its website, Barclays obtained a middle-of-the-night injunction forcing it to take them down, along with a gagging order. It was only after Liberal Democrat peer Lord Oakeshott referred to them in the House of Lords using parliamentary privilege that the paper was able to inform readers.",

He writes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>After fading in the polls, Grillo's Five Star Movement (M5S) is surging back, its cause boosted by the scandal at Italy's third-biggest bank,&#xa0;Monte dei Paschidi Siena (MPS). Since MPS was always beholden to the left, the scandal proves to many Italians what Grillo has always claimed - that Italy's politicians are all the same and, in a phrase he used several times at his rally, should be mandati a casa - sent packing.</p> <p>In response, the mainstream leaders had called him all sorts of names: \"populist\", \"demagogue\", \"megalomaniac\", he told the crowd before inviting them to do the same. \"One . . . two . . . three . . .\" \"POP-U-LIST-A\", the crowd roared back. It was a neat way of dodging the most pertinent criticism of his movement.</p> </blockquote> <p>Hooper says that if the M5S's support grows at the same pace as in recent weeks, <strong>it could be in a position to stop both left and right from wielding a majority. That would panic the markets and could trigger a new eurozone crisis</strong>, he says, as Grillo has ruled out any coalition with the established parties.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-853f568d-38b5-455c-8edf-1c9440b86ba6\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/2/11/1360579500140/937cf54b-545d-4e04-8ac1-9cd39dde1131-460.jpeg\" alt=\"Beppe Grillo, leader of the Five Star Movement, during a rally last month.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Beppe Grillo, leader of the Five Star Movement, during a rally last month.

Mario Draghi meets Spanish lawmakers to discuss the bond-buying programme. While on the economics front, the big announcement will be UK inflation numbers, with CPI and RPI figures released at 9.30am, along with the latest PPI UK numbers Thanks for all your comments, see you tomorrow. A master of brevity, European Council President, Herman Van Rompuy, has issued a statement on Pope Benedict XVI's resignation. This is his statement in full: I deeply respect the decision of Pope Benedict XVI, especially since it is not in line with tradition. His pontificate has been short but very difficult. FTSE 100 up 13 points to 6277 DAX down 18 points to 7634 CAC flat at 3650 IBEX down 96 points to 8079 FTSE MIB down 101 points to 16530 The euro has settled from recent 15-month highs as the EBC's Jens Weidmann said discussions about an overvaluation of the euro are a diversion of politicians' task to sort out their economies. Taking a swipe at France's President Hollande, who suggested political interference to control the exchange rate, Weidmann said: The Eurosystem [of eurozone central banks] cannot solve the crisis. Only governments can solve these problems, the central banks cannot. In this respect the discussion about a supposed overvaluation of the euro's exchange rate simply deviates from the real challenges. The euro hit $1.371/\u20ac1 at the start of the month. After his comments it cooled off to $1.342/\u20ac1. Latvia said GDP grew 1.3% in the fourth quarter of 2012, down from 1.7% for the 3rd quarter. The country took an EU/IMF bailout in 2009, paying it off in late 2011 following a series of deep austerity cuts. But strong exports to Germany and other Baltic countries has seen the country bounce back with forecast growth on 3.8% next year. PM Valdis Dombrovskis said he will formally ask EU officials to assess whether the country can join the single currency in 2014, despite public opposition in the country. Agreeing with Cameron, Miliband says more must be done to reduce agriculture spending from the EU budget. Agriculture subsidies accounted for: 46% of total budget EU in 1997 33% in 2010 31% in 2013 Cameron said this will reduce to 27% by 2020, because it is only 1% of European industry. Brief statement from Cameron. Now Labour leader Ed Miliband is giving his response. He too praises the pope. You can watch the statements on the parliament website here Cameron is telling MPs how he managed to negotiate the overall budget down, but admits UK payments will continue to rise, just \"not as fast as they could have,\" he says. Also calls on more reforms, particularly on the CAP. He added: \"We now expect our EU contributions to fall as a percentage of gross national income.\" Staying at Westminster, the prime minister, David Cameron, is about to make a statement on his meeting at the European council last week. Over in the Grimond room at the Houses of Parliament, RBS boss Stephen Hester is getting ready for his appearance in front of the banking commission. While he waits, a warmup act of executives are answering questions. John Hourican, former chief executive officer of Markets &amp; International Banking (he resigned over the Libor scandal), Peter Nielsen, chief executive officer of Markets, RBS Group, and Johnny Cameron, former chairman of Global Banking and Markets, RBS Group, are eating lots of humble pie. And with that I will pass the blog over to my colleague Simon Neville. Thanks for all your comments. More from former Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, who said today that he was sure his centre-right coalition had taken the lead in the runup to the elections later this month. Berlusconi said on the radio: I believe that we have overtaken [the centre-left Democratic Party]... they are now behind us. Berlusconi also said he had made a \"major screwup\" when he countersigned the nomination that made outgoing premier Mario Monti a life senator. And finally... Berlusconi was forced to defend some wildly inappropriate remarks he made to a young female factory worker in Veneto over the weekend, saying that they had been taken \"out of context\". On Sunday, Berlusconi asked a solar power technician during a company visit if she made house calls, if she \"comes to homes\" and how many times she is willing \"to come\". Over in Greece, proposed changes to labour law that would make it harder for unions to call strikes has threatened unity in the coalition government. ekathimerini reports: Two of the three coalition partners, PASOK and Democratic Left, voiced objections following a report in Sunday\u2019s To Vima newspaper that suggested Labor Minister Yiannis Vroutsis of New Democracy wants to make changes that would require strikes to need the support of the majority of union members, while giving management the right to enforce a lockout if employees do not return to work. The Greek government recently forced striking civil servants back to work with a controversial mobilisation order. But \u2013 as FT Alphaville reporter Joseph Cotterill points out \u2013 Cyprus law may not be powerful enough to block the bail-in plan. Cyprus will not impose losses on depositors in its banks, the country's finance minister has said, after a report in the FT about a plan that would force losses on uninsured depositors in Cypriot banks, as well as investors in the country's sovereign debt (see 9.15am). Such a deal would be impossible under Cyprus law and the country's constitution, Vassos Shiarly said on the way into the Eurogroup meeting of finance ministers. I would say that the bail-in of depositors is a grossly exaggerated possibility, unlikely to happen, we will not accept it under any circumstances and I don't think it creates any way forward. His comments come after the European commission dismissed the report, which claimed the commission had drafted a document that proposed bailing-in non-domestic depositors as an option to tackle the country's financial troubles. Dow Jones reports: The spokesman [for the EC] declined to respond to questions about whether other institutions were pushing for these options, and said he wouldn't comment on the existence of the document mentioned in the report. Another week, another round of protests in Greece. Today students are marching in the country's second largest city, Thessaloniki, protesting against education reforms shutting down schools. While in Athens, Keep Talking Greece reports that several hundred protesters gathered outside the health ministry, demanding an appointment with the minister. Over to Ireland, where consumer confidence jumped to a five-month high in January. The KBC Bank Ireland/ERSI sentiment index rose to 64.2 in January v 49.8 in December \u2013 its largest ever monthly rise. That was even before the government struck a vital deal with the European Central Bank over legacy bank debt last Thursday. The index fell to a 12-month low in December after the Irish government announced more tax hikes and spending cuts, as part of the austerity drive demanded by Ireland's international lenders. Austin Hughes, economist at KBC said the sharp swings in the survey are a sign that consumers remain unsure about the health of the economy and are nervous about their household finances. Speaking on his way into the Eurogroup meeting, French finance minister Pierre Moscovici said: We will have a debate about exchange rates. The euro has appreciated strongly in recent months... for positive reasons, because confidence is coming back in the eurozone. We should have \u2013 I have insisted this debate takes place \u2013 a coordinated approach between us that will allow for us to argue for exchange rate stability, especially within the G20. I think that we must, at the international level, argue for a coordinated approach that will allow us to have a stable exchange rate and this this exchange rate reflects the fundamentals of our economies so that expectations of economic agents are anchored... Exchange rates should not be subject to moods or speculation. France's finance minister Pierre Moscovici says the eurozone needs closer co-ordination on exchange rate policy, Reuters reports, adding that he will discuss the issue today at the Eurogroup meeting. The eurozone's finance ministers are gathering in Brussels for a meeting at 1.30pm, with a farewell dinner for former chairman of the group Jean-Claude Juncker, later tonight. My colleague Paul Owen will have all the developments on the pope's resignation on our swiftly-assembled live blog. Meanwhile, in other, non pope-related news, the TUC has created a graphic that shows just how badly Britain is doing in the global economy. TUC senior policy officer @DuncanWeldon writes: The most straight forward way to measure our progress in the global race is to look at growth. The info-graphic above compares our performance to those of the other major economies in the G7 group since the Budget of June 2010. As can be seen when compared to our international peers our growth performance is nothing to get excited about. If there is a global race we seem to be losing it. Plenty of Pope-related hilarity on Twitter... The pope says in a statement that his strength is no longer adequate to continue in office, due to his advanced age. He says he is \"fully aware of the gravity of this gesture\". A Vatican spokesman says the new pontiff should be in place by Easter. The papacy will apparently be vacant until a successor is chosen. This is not entirely unexpected, according to a report published on the Washington Post website last year. The pope is approaching his 86th birthday and there has been persistent speculation about his declining health. Alessandro Speciale of the Religion News Service wrote last April: The German-born pope has appeared tired and fatigued in recent months and admitted at a morning Mass to being in \u201cthe final leg of the path of my life.\u201d But on Sunday, he signaled his resolve to carry on with his duties as leader of the world\u2019s 1.2 billion Catholics, asking the faithful to pray that he have the \u201cstrength\u201d to \u201cfulfill his mission.\u201d Last October, Benedict started using a movable platform to carry him down the central aisle in St. Peter\u2019s Basilica, and he leaned on a cane before boarding the plane for a recent weeklong trip to Cuba and Mexico. He his now the sixth-oldest pope since at least the 1400s; the oldest, Pope Leo XIII, died in 1903 at age 93. Hats off to the Telegraph's Kate Day, who reckons this resignation is almost unprecedented. Wikipedia says that papal resignation was to end the Western Schism, which had reached the point where there were three claimants to the papal throne. Bloomberg is reporting that the current pope is quitting due to ill health, so no great scandal on the horizon then. The news appears to be coming from Italian news agency ANSA, which says the pope will announce his resignation on 28 February. For the record, the pope's last tweet was as follows. A coded message of some kind? Reports coming in that the pope has resigned, prompting lots of people in the office to ask: Can you resign if you're a pope? More on that as it comes in. Back to Italy and the man who could throw the country into turmoil after the elections of 24 and 25 February. And no, it's not Silvio Berlusconi. Our correspondent in Rome, John Hooper reports in today's paper on the rise of Italian populist Beppe Grillo. He writes: After fading in the polls, Grillo's Five Star Movement (M5S) is surging back, its cause boosted by the scandal at Italy's third-biggest bank, Monte dei Paschidi Siena (MPS). Since MPS was always beholden to the left, the scandal proves to many Italians what Grillo has always claimed - that Italy's politicians are all the same and, in a phrase he used several times at his rally, should be mandati a casa - sent packing. In response, the mainstream leaders had called him all sorts of names: \"populist\", \"demagogue\", \"megalomaniac\", he told the crowd before inviting them to do the same. \"One . . . two . . . three . . .\" \"POP-U-LIST-A\", the crowd roared back. It was a neat way of dodging the most pertinent criticism of his movement. Hooper says that if the M5S's support grows at the same pace as in recent weeks, it could be in a position to stop both left and right from wielding a majority. That would panic the markets and could trigger a new eurozone crisis, he says, as Grillo has ruled out any coalition with the established parties. China has surpassed the US as the world's biggest trading nation, Bloomberg reports, pulling together some intriguing trade stats from both countries. US imports and exports of goods last year totalled $3.82 trillion, the US commerce department said last week. While China\u2019s customs administration reported last month that the country\u2019s trade in goods in 2012 amounted to $3.87 trillion. Bloomberg reports: China\u2019s growing influence in global commerce threatens to disrupt regional trading blocs as it becomes the most important commercial partner for some countries. Germany may export twice as much to China by the end of the decade as it does to France, estimated Goldman Sachs's Jim O\u2019Neill. \u201cFor so many countries around the world, China is becoming rapidly the most important bilateral trade partner,\u201d O\u2019Neill, chairman of Goldman Sachs\u2019s asset management division and the economist who bound Brazil to Russia, India and China to form the BRIC investing strategy, said in a telephone interview. \u201cAt this kind of pace by the end of the decade many European countries will be doing more individual trade with China than with bilateral partners in Europe.\" There are conflicting reports over the potential size of any bank recapitalisation for Cyprus. Reports suggest Pimco \u2013 which is carrying out a review of Cypriot banks \u2013 thinks the country's financial system will need \u20ac10bn to stay afloat. But the Cypriot government argues that it should be no higher than \u20ac8bn. That would reduce the potential \u20ac17bn bill for a full bailout. No figure has yet been confirmed and this month the Cypriot central bank said the amount needed by the banks would not be made public until the bailout deal was agreed with international lenders. According to the confidential memorandum prepared ahead of Monday\u2019s meeting of eurozone finance ministers, which the FT cited this morning, a full bailout is still expected to cost \u20ac16.7bn. Whatever its form, an aid package for Cyprus should be ready by the end of next month, ECB executive board member Joerg Asmussen said in an interview published this morning. Asmussen told German business daily Handelsblatt (in German): I expect the aid programme for Cyprus will be in place by the end of March. He added that German politicians should not try and delay a decision on Cyprus until after the German elections in September. There must be no doubt about this: if Cyprus gets no external help, it will slide into default. Back to Cyprus and the news that policymakers are preparing a radical rescue for the island nation. The FT reports this morning that one of the options on the table for Cyprus is a so-called 'bail-in', which would force losses on uninsured depositors in Cypriot banks, as well as investors in the country's sovereign debt. Peter Spiegel in Brussels and Quentin Peel in Berlin write: The proposal for a \u201cbail-in\u201d of investors and depositors, and drastic shrinking of the Cypriot banking sector, is one of three options put forward as alternatives to a full-scale bailout. The ministers are trying to agree a rescue plan by March, to follow the presidential elections in Cyprus later this month. The new plan has not been endorsed by its authors in the European Commission or by individual eurozone members. The memo warns that \u201cthe risks associated with this option are significant\u201d, including a renewed danger of contagion in eurozone financial markets, and premature collapse in the Cypriot banking sector. Over to Italy, where Berlusconi continues to make waves ahead of the elections on 24-25 February. Over the weekend, outgoing prime minister Mario Monti accused Berlusconi of trying to buy votes with impossible promises. Among other things, Berlusconi says he will reduce spending by two percentage points a year to finance tax cuts. He has promised to pay back, in cash, an unpopular housing tax levied by Monti. He also appeared to promise to create 4 million new jobs last week but was forced to withdraw the claim the same day. Berlusconi has edged up in the polls and is currently within around five points of the leading centre-left Democratic Party (PD), led by Pier Luigi Bersani. Although the PD is expected to win a solid lower house majority, it may need a deal with Monti's centrists to gain the control of the Senate. Meanwhile, the Daily Telegraph reports that Berlusconi's girlfriend has vanished from his side in recent weeks, apparently the victim of voters' disapproval. Tom Kington writes: Francesca Pascale, 27, appeared regularly at the former prime minister's side at the start of his electoral campaign. However her absence since December has prompted media speculation that she has been cast aside after surveys carried out by Mr Berlusconi revealed Italians did not approve of his decision to date a woman nearly five decades younger than him. Miss Pascale was reportedly encouraged to dress more soberly and took speech classes to ready herself for the role of first lady, but her image was damaged when old footage reappeared of her dancing in a bikini on a local TV show in Naples, where she worked as a showgirl, sucking provocatively on an ice lolly. This widening gulf between the economic fortunes of France and Germany has led to a growing policy divide, which is hobbling the region's core partnership, Reuters reported over the weekend. Mark John wrote: Berlin rejected President Francois Hollande's call on Tuesday to set a mid-term target for the euro, a move he hoped would bring the single currency down to a level that would make it easier for French industry to sell its goods abroad. Three days later, German Chancellor Angela Merkel joined forces with Britain's David Cameron at a Brussels summit to push through the first ever cut in the 27-nation's budget, taking an axe to spending on infrastructure projects backed by Paris. \"Is it the budget I would have liked if it was just up to me? No. But the problem with Europe is that there are others involved,\" a resigned Hollande told reporters after all-night talks secured a deal on EU funding from 2014-2020. Both Hollande and Merkel have insisted that the Franco-German motor is still driving EU integration 50 years after the friendship pact between the former World War Two foes. But while they say achievements such as last year's deal on EU banking supervision show that Paris and Berlin can still overcome their differences to forge compromises, the French voice is increasingly struggling to make itself heard. There was more bad news for France this morning, with industrial production falling 0.1% in December. That came down from a 0.5% increase in November, although it was not as bad as analysts feared, with forecasts for a 0.2% decline. There is an ever-widening gulf between France, Europe's second largest economy, and Germany, the region's biggest. Our economics editor Larry Elliott fears France could join list of eurozone casualties in a fresh crisis. The longer term trends in industrial production look even worse, with output dropping 1.8% over the quarter, and 3.1% compared with the final quarter of 2011. The decline in manufacturing output in the last quarter of 2012 was even sharper, falling 2.5% from the third quarter and 3.9% on the year. So for a quick look at what else is happening today... France industrial output for December: 7.45am Spain house transactions for December: 8am Eurogroup meets in Brussels: 1.30pm RBS chiefs face grilling from MPs: 4.30pm In the debt markets, Germany will auction \u20ac4bn of six-month debt and France is issuing \u20ac7.6bn of three to 12-month debt. Also on the agenda is the possible bailout of Cyprus, a week before the island nation's presidential elections. Cypriots go to the polls on 17 February to elect a new president for a five-year term, with a runoff on 24 February if the first round does not produce a winner with an outright majority. The winner will have to negotiate a bailout for the tiny economy, heavily exposed to the Greek debt crisis. Polls out over the weekend suggested Cyprus's rightwing opposition leader had widened his lead over his two main challengers, as voters looked for a fresh pair of hands to revive their struggling economy. Just to recap... Cyprus is seeking a bailout of around \u20ac17bn, including at least \u20ac10bn to recapitalise its banking sector. Negotiations initially stalled over the issue of economic reforms and privatisations, required by the troika but rejected by outgoing Communist president Dimitris Christofias. German MPs have also voiced concerns that a bailout would benefit money-launderers who allegedly hold huge sums in Cypriot banks. German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble also raised doubts about the \"systemic relevance\" of the island economy. If the country's economic failure is not considered to pose a threat to the region as a whole, it does not qualify for a bailout. But reports have suggested Germany may be willing to abandon its opposition to a bailout, under pressure from the European commission and other eurozone countries. Good morning and welcome back to our rolling coverage of the eurozone crisis and other global economic events. Today Dutch finance minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem takes the reins at the Eurogroup meeting of eurozone finance ministers. Dijsselbloem takes over from Jean-Claude Juncker of Luxembourg just as an apparent improvement in fortunes for the region has posed a whole new problem: a strong euro dampening the economy. The French finance minister, Pierre Moscovici, will be at pains to suggest that the rise in the euro is not helping his country's struggling economy. But he will face opposition from Germany, which last week said the rate of the euro appears appropriate for the moment.",

      "bodyText": "Trouble-hit Barclays has admitted making an embarrassing gaffe over the reporting of a lifeline investment in the bank that saved it from seeking a government bailout during the financial crisis of 2008. Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the owner of Manchester City, was named at a vote of shareholders on 24 November as the investor who had pumped in \u00a33bn to the then cash-strapped bank. But the following day, only the small print of regulatory disclosures by the bank showed that he had passed the stake on to the International Petroleum Investment Company, owned by the state of Abu Dhabi, of which he is chairman. The Barclays annual report of 2008, issued much later, still refers to Mansour as being the owner of the stake, something that Barclays now calls a \"drafting error\". The mistake came to light in during an investigation by the BBC's Panorama programme to be aired on Monday night . The programme questions whether shareholders were properly kept informed. Professor Alistair Milne, an expert on City regulation, tells Panorama that banks are expected to release accurate information about major deals. \"Any discrepancy of that kind is serious because it raises questions in the minds of investors,\" he says. \"Every bank is well aware the annual report is a critical document and a huge amount of time and attention is put in to trying to get all the details correct.\" The mistake comes at an awkward time for the bank which is in the middle of an investigation into disclosures it made when it raised funds from Qatar at the same time. It also comes just ahead of a key \"strategy day\" briefing by Barclays chief executive, Antony Jenkins, when he will try to outline a new way forward for a business hit by Libor and others scandals. The bank said on Sunday night it was satisfied that it had kept shareholders closely informed of all changes in ownerships of stakes as soon as they were confirmed. \"Immediately following receipt and verification of that information [on 24 November 24] we made overnight amendments to the relevant disclosures relating to the investors in the prospectus documents. The change in ownership of the investing companies had no bearing on the transaction or required approvals.\" Panaroma also investigates the structured capital markets (SCM) division which Jenkins will announce on Tuesday is to be shut down. The programme said SCM employed just 100 people and yet made up to \u00a31bn a year in profit for Barclays. Jenkins took the helm in September following the sudden departure of Bob Diamond in July over the Libor rigging scandal. Jenkins's strategy day will coincide with full-year results which will be hit by the \u00a3290m Libor fine and charges for mis-selling payment protection insurance and interest rate swaps to small businesses. He has promised to clean up the culture of the bank, telling staff to leave if they do not want to abide by new rules of ethical behaviour. Some 2,000 jobs are expected to go but Jenkins has made clear the bank will not be broken up along its investment banking and retail banking lines.",

      "bodyText": "Businesses entered the new year in buoyant mood according to a wide-ranging survey that adds to the growing pile of evidence showing the UK will avoid a triple dip recession. A slowdown in the last months of 2012 was reversed in January following a jump in activity, according to the Lloyds TSB regional purchasing managers' index. Eight of the nine regions in the study expanded output with Yorkshire and Humber recording the fastest rate of growth. The rebound also encouraged firms to hire more staff, confirming a Recruitment and Employment Confederation survey last week that showed an increase for the fourth consecutive month in permanent jobs coupled with a rise in starting salaries. Lloyds said that although the latest figures showed only a moderate pace of expansion across the regions overall, this was the highest level of output growth seen since September 2012. Companies that saw an increase in new orders mostly cited improvements in business confidence and the launch of new projects, according to the survey, which was conducted by financial data provider Markit.

The OECD, the Paris-based think tank, forecasts that growth will be 0.7% in 2013 and that the UK's major export destinations in the eurozone will grow equally slowly or remain in recession.
