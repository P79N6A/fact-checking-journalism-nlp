      "bodyText": "Shoppers will splash out more than \u00a32.5bn on Black Friday deals, as the UK continues its affair with the US-inspired discount day. Sales will continue over the weekend with \u00a37.3bn expected to be spent between Friday morning and Monday night according to the Centre for Retail Research and the Vouchercodes website. A fifth more people are expected to hit the high street than on a normal Friday, according to ShopperTrak, but most of the action takes place online in this country, with shoppers choosing to bargain hunt from under the duvet using their phone or laptop rather than queueing up outside stores in the early hours. Spending is expected to be up this year as more stores join the event, but experts say bargains may be harder to find as stores battle rising costs and inflation.Moneysavingexpert.com advises shopping around and researching the items you want to buy rather than relying on discount promises from retailers. They may be offering \u201c70% off\u201d their own price, but it doesn\u2019t mean the same item isn\u2019t cheaper elsewhere. Sticking to a shopping list of items you actually want, using price tracker tools such as Camelcamelcamel and watching out for discount codes are also a good idea. Finally, be wary of \u201ctoo good to be true\u201d prices \u2013 quite possibly they are \u2013 so carefully check terms and conditions and buyer reviews for sites you\u2019ve not used before offering very cheap prices.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s online retailers won the battle for sales on Black Friday with overall spending up on a year ago despite a drop in the number of shoppers visiting stores. As the annual shopping jamboree kicked off, a dip in web traffic figures and fewer shoppers out on the high streets suggested Britons were falling out of love with the American-inspired discount day. But momentum built during the day and Barclaycard, which processes nearly half of all debit and credit card transactions in the UK, estimated that Black Friday spending finished up 8% on 2016. John Lewis described the promotional bonanza as \u201cone of its most successful days\u201d. The department store chain said it had its busiest ever single hour of online trading, but that it was too early to say if a sales record had been set. Dino Rocos, the retailer\u2019s operations director, said: \u201cSales on Johnlewis.com both overnight and into the day itself have exceeded expectation. We expect traffic will continue to the website throughout the weekend.\u201d While sales were strong online, fewer shoppers hit the high street than last year, continuing a long-term change in habits. Three years ago police and ambulances were called to major supermarkets as near-riots broke out among shoppers desperate to grab bargains. But this year the supermarkets either opted out of the event or had only limited deals available. Yesterday at a branch of Currys/PC World on London\u2019s Oxford Street, the doors were flung open at 7am and only one shopper, who had pre-ordered a laptop, was waiting. By mid-afternoon the number of visitors to shopping centres, retail parks and high streets across the country was down 8% as analysts said more than a week of previous discounting by fashion and electrical goods chains had spread demand. \u201cIt was not Black Friday but mid grey week,\u201d said Diane Wehrle of shopper traffic measuring firm Springboard. \u201cWith the budget this week and concerns about the economy, people are feeling fairly cautious about spending money on stuff they possibly don\u2019t really need.\u201d John Lewis said the most popular product searches were for iPads and Sonos speakers, suggesting these are among the most sought after gifts this Christmas. But shoppers also bought sofa beds and expensive perfume such as Creed, which costs \u00a3207 a bottle. Argos said more than 2 million people visited its website in the four hours after it launched its Black Friday deals on Thursday night. \u201cThese early record-breaking figures show that savvy shoppers are keen to bag themselves a bargain in the run-up to Christmas,\u201d said John Rogers, the Argos chief executive. \u201cPeople are clearly buying their big Christmas presents, as we\u2019ve seen a real spike in sales of video games and consoles as well as iPads and TVs.\u201d Shoppers were predicted to spend more than \u00a32.5bn on Black Friday itself. The number of shoppers online between midnight and 7am was 24% lower than last year, according to the e-commerce trends service PCA Predict, after an 11% rise in shopping over the previous week. But by 5.30pm the number of shoppers was up 3% year on year. \u201cThis longer sales period has shifted the emphasis away from Black Friday being a major retail event in its own right, towards becoming part of a pre-Christmas mini-season or \u2018golden quarter\u2019 for retailers,\u201d said Chris Boaz, \u200ethe head of marketing at PCA Predict. While Friday morning was quiet, Boaz said there had been a huge surge in online sales on Thursday evening as people tried to beat the rush to snap up the best deals. John Lewis admitted its online store had crashed for a short period as shoppers searched for bargains and as the department store price-matched rivals\u2019 early Black Friday offers. Video games specialist Game also admitted to some problems with its checkout service after its deals launched on Thursday night as gamers raced to get their hands on a Nintendo Switch. With household finances tight this year, retailers are hoping a discount frenzy will persuade shoppers to open their wallets. The high-street clothing retailer Next, which traditionally refuses to offer pre-Christmas discounts, entered the Black Friday fray for the first time to boost flagging sales. The analyst Tony Shiret said Next\u2019s offer of 70% off all Black Friday lines showed the retailer was struggling to clear stock in its usual end-of-season sales. \u2022Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

      "bodyText": "Hopes that Germany could yet form a coalition government after the Social Democrats held out the prospect of talks to break the current deadlock gave some support to European markets. But a stronger euro limited the gains, while UK shares dipped marginally as the pound moved higher against the dollar. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 7.6 points or 0.1% at 7409.64 Germany\u2019s Dax rose 0.39% to 13,059.84 France\u2019s Cac climbed 0.2% to 5390.46 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB edged up 0.08% to 22,416.31 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 0.21% at 10,053.5 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.36% to 723.18 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has closed up 32 points or 0.14% in a shortened trading session. The US markets were helped by a strong performance from Amazon on Black Friday sales hopes. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back on Monday. Here\u2019s the latest Barclaycard update on Black Friday, and there\u2019s another new record. So far there has been an 8% increase in the amount spent compared to the same day last year, and Barclaycard processed a record 998 transactions a second between 1pm and 2pm. That beats the previous record of 976 set an hour earlier. In Greece Black Friday has brought euphoria but also protests with unions denouncing the \u201cforeign-imported\u201d tradition as a \u201cblack day\u201d for workers, reports Helena Smith : While scenes of savvy shop buyers rushing to pick up goods at bargain prices were recorded in major Greek cities, employees were just as quick to denounce Black Friday as a commercial ploy. Protesting outside the labour ministry in Athens, the Association of Shop employees called the custom \u2013 being marked in Greece for a second year \u2013 as an affront to workers\u2019 rights. Contracts had been openly flouted in the face of the foreign imported fiesta, said unionists, demanding that employers \u201cpay overtime to workers and fines be imposed.\u201d In the main commercial hubs of Athens and Thessaloniki, protestors are gathering this afternoon to demonstrate against \u201cthe unpaid and uninsured overtime \u2026 and hunger wages.\u201d Employers were getting away with yet more exploitation by adopting a custom that amounted to outright \u201cfraud\u201d. A stronger euro has seen European markets come off their best levels, while a rise in the pound against the dollar has left the FTSE 100 lingering in negative territory. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: The prospect of political progress in Germany buoyed the euro on Friday afternoon, while the dollar continued to move lower. The news that Angela Merkel and her CDU-CSU party are set to meet with their former Social Democrat coalition partners acted as a pick me up for the euro, which surged 0.6% to a 2 month high against the dollar, while taking another 0.3% off the pound, pushing sterling to its worst price in more than a week. These gains took the edge off the DAX\u2019s own growth, with a 1% lunchtime surge halving to 0.5%; still, this keeps the German index above 13000, a level its struggled with for the past few sessions. As for the dollar, its drop against the euro was joined by a 0.4% decline against the pound, with cable climbing above $1.335 to hit its best price since the start of October. There are a few things dragging the greenback lower: a pair of weaker than forecast flash manufacturing and services PMIs; Wednesday\u2019s cautious Fed meeting minutes, which cast doubt not on a December rate rise, but the pace of any subsequent hikes; and a series of bearish notes from analysts, including those at Nomura and Morgan Stanley. Add on a Thanksgiving hangover and it was a grey Black Friday for the currency. The FTSE, meanwhile, continued to trail its peers \u2013 not just the Eurozone, but the Dow Jones, which rose 0.2% after the bell \u2013 dipping 0.1% as the day went on. Multiple times this year the UK index has got trapped around the 7400 mark, with the FTSE facing a momentum-less run in to Christmas. The weaker than expected US data has undermined the dollar. The pound is now up 0.35% against the US currency at $1.3351, while the euro is also strengthening against the greenback: Dennis de Jong, managing director of UFX.com, said: Donald Trump and his economic advisors will be concerned with the latest Markit survey coming in below expectations, after what has been a fairly robust upward trajectory since the start of the year. The president has had some significant knockbacks in implementing promised infrastructure plans, and it would be no surprise to see him continue to lay the blame with foreign firms undercutting the US sector. US industry has lost global market share in recent years, with labour-intensive, low-cost countries and knowledge-based, tech-led economies picking US jobs off at both ends of the manufacturing spectrum. Policy makers, not to mention the president himself, will be looking to address this as a priority. US manufacturing slipped back in November but still showed a strong level of growth, according to the latest snapshot. The IHS Market initial manufacturing PMI came in at 53.8, down from 54.6 in October and below expectations of a rise to 54.8. The services PMI fell from 55.3 to 54.7 in November while the composite PMI dipped from 55.2 to 54.6. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit said: US businesses reported another month of solid growth in November, putting the economy on course for a reasonable, though by no means stellar, fourth quarter. Current PMI readings are broadly consistent with GDP growing at an annualised rate of just over 2%. There was also good news on hiring, with a slight uptick in employment growth meaning the surveys are indicating non-farm payroll growth of just over 200,000 in November. Both input costs and selling price inflation picked up, suggesting the upturn is feeding though to higher price pressures, though some of the manufacturing price hikes were attributable to the short-term effects of the hurricane-related supply chain disruptions. An upturn in new order inflows means we can expect a strong end to the year, though prospects for 2018 remain more mixed. Although expectations about the year ahead slipped lower in the service sector, future optimism hit a two-year high in manufacturing, suggesting the goods-producing sector may start to make a stronger contribution to the economy in coming months. After a day off for Thanksgiving, US markets have started off in a positive mood. Helped by higher oil prices and rising retail shares on Black Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 37 points or 0.16% while the S&amp;P 500 opened 0.17% higher and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.13%. Both the S&amp;P and Nasdaq have hit new peaks. According to Barclaycard, there has been a 4% increase in the amount spent on debit and credit cards by 1pm today compared to last Black Friday. That includes high street and online sales, and also other spending such as buying a pint of milk. With sales picking up as the day progresses after a slow start, Barclaycard also says it processed a record 976 transactions a second between 12pm and 1pm. Last year\u2019a Black Friday peak was 791 transactions per second. Paulette Rowe, managing director of Barclaycard Payment Solutions, said: Early data suggests that shoppers have once again embraced Black Friday, with many taking advantage of the discounts on offer. The value spent is growing at a slightly slower rate than the number of transactions, indicating consumers may be opting to buy more goods at a lower price rather than investing in a handful of higher-value items. Nevertheless, it\u2019s \u2018so far, so normal\u2019 on the high street and retailers will likely be encouraged by the results. Back with Black Friday, and here is a gallery of pictures from around the world: Meanwhile US retail shares are moving higher in premarket trading ahead of the official Wall Street opening, with Macy\u2019s up 1.1%, J C Penney 2.5% better and Best Buy 0.9% better. Oil prices are on the rise ahead of a key Opec meeting next week. Brent crude is up 0.19% to $63.67 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate jumped nearly 1.5% to a more than two year high of $58.91. Part of the increase is due to the partial shutdown of a pipeline linking Canada with the US after an oil spill, reducing the usual 590,000 barrels a day supply. Meanwhile the Opec meeting is widely expected to extend its agreement to curb supplies beyond the original March end date, although Russia\u2019s position on the idea is a little unclear. Analysts at S&amp;P have raised their 2018 price target for Brent crude to $55 a barrel but kept their WTI target at $50, saying, \u201cWe anticipate that global oil supply is likely to broadly match consumption in the first half of 2018, assuming the Opec cuts are maintained.\u201d S&amp;P added: We recognize the typical volatility of these market indicators, as demonstrated during 2017. We also note the persistence of a wider differential of $6 per barrel (/bbl) between Brent and WTI recently, although we believe this differential is likely to be nominally smaller in 2018. We base our long-term price assumptions mostly on fundamental analysis including assessments of the marginal cost of oil and gas production, as well as supply and demand fundamentals, for example We continue to expect Brent and WTI to be range-bound in 2018. We note that Brent has been trading above $60/bbl since Oct. 27, 2017, having closed at that price on Sept. 25 for the first time since July 2015. As present, futures prices remain above $60/bbl until November 2018. We believe the price increases reflect ongoing OPEC production cuts, supply disruptions, and temporary production declines as well as positive market sentiment about demand. Shipments from northern Iraq were reportedly lower in October and production from several other regions was down as well. However, we assume these specific supply issues will be addressed in coming months. What\u2019s more, we believe that continuing production growth may marginally exceed consumption growth in 2018. Tucking into some lunch at your desk, perhaps after a dash to Pret or Greggs? If so (and even if not!), then get your teeth into the history of Britain\u2019s UK sandwich industry. Guardian Long Read: How the sandwich consumed Britain Honestly, it\u2019s a great read. Over in Germany, Amazon workers have gone on strike in protest against pay at the e-commerce giant. The walkout has hit half a dozen Amazon distribution sites in Germany, as staff demand better wages. Workers at its main distribution hub in Italy are also on strike, potentially disrupting activities on Black Friday. Associated Press has more details: In Germany, Ver.di union spokesman Thomas Voss said some 2,500 workers were on strike at Amazon facilities in Bad Hersfeld, Leipzig, Rheinberg, Werne, Graben and Koblenz. In a warehouse near Piacenza, in northern Italy, some workers walked off the job to demand \u201cdignified salaries.\u201d The German union has been leading a push since 2013 for higher pay for some 12,000 workers in Germany, arguing Amazon employees receive lower wages than others in retail and mail-order jobs. Amazon says its distribution warehouses in Germany are logistics centers and employees earn relatively high wages for that industry. The strikes in Germany are expected to end Saturday. The Italian action, a one-day strike, was hailed by one of the nation\u2019s umbrella union leaders, the UIL\u2019s Carmelo Barbagallo, as having \u201cenormous symbolic value because it\u2019s clear that progress, innovation and modernity can\u2019t come at the expense and the interests of workers.\u201d Here are more photos, from the city of Leipzig today: If you are risking Black Friday, know your rights! Hannah Maundrell, Editor in Chief of money.co.uk, explains: \u201cBe a savvy shopper instead of a bargain hunter. Work out a plan of attack: make a list, set a budget and hunt for the cheapest place to buy. Never checkout without checking if you can save even more with a voucher code \u2013 often found by signing up to newsletters or on retailer\u2019s social media sites. If you buy something online which you find cheaper elsewhere next week, don\u2019t worry, you have 14 days to return it and get a full refund no questions asked. \u201cDouble check your refund rights before you part with your cash and if you\u2019re buying something that costs over \u00a3100, pay with a credit card because you can go to your credit card company for a refund if something goes wrong. The drop in UK consumer confidence comes as people in America and the rest of Europe are feeling more optimistic. This chart, from Kallum Pickering of Berenberg, shows how UK consumer morale has fallen behind other advanced economies recently: Pickering says: After eight years of a recovery that had occasionally been punctured by the euro crisis, a hiccup in emerging markets and gyrations in oil prices, households are becoming increasingly confident. Consumer confidence in the US and the Eurozone has risen above pre-Lehman peaks, with the Brexit-stricken UK serving as the exception to the rule. Even in the UK, where households are suffering from a temporary real wage squeeze due to the Brexit-related drop in trade-weighted sterling and the resulting rise in import costs, consumer confidence remains broadly in line with its long-term average. Economist Sam Tombs has analysed this morning\u2019s mortgage approval figures, and concluded that the market is cooling.... Despite the entertaining lack of a rush on Oxford Street at 7am, Currys PC World says its having its busiest Black Friday ever - on the Internet. Online traffic via mobile devices is up 14% on last year, apparently, with TV and gaming consoles particularly popular. Robert Gordon, CEO of Hitachi Capital, isn\u2019t surprised that UK consumers are more pessimistic: \u201cJob security, stagnating pay and rising inflation are all putting the squeeze on consumers, so it\u2019s no surprise that consumer confidence has dipped to a new low Black Friday couldn\u2019t have come quickly enough for retailers, and it will be interesting to see if the weekend\u2019s sales are as robust this year as they have been in previous years. The Financial Times has spotted that UK households withdrew money from their tax-free savings accounts at the fastest rate on record in October. It\u2019s another sign that people are feeling the pinch, as falling real wages continue to bite. The FT\u2019s Nicholas Megaw explains: New data from UK Finance suggest households have been saving less and borrowing more in an effort to maintain spending habits in the face of rising prices and falling real wages. The total amount held in cash ISA accounts fell by \u00a31.5bn, the sixth straight month of declines and the biggest monthly withdrawal on record in data going back to 2006. UK shoppers are right to be wary of Black Friday \u2018bargains\u2019, according to industry experts. Gemma Butler, associate director of marketing at the Chartered Institute of Marketing, says \u2018wise consumers\u2019 will keep their wallets and purses closed. She warns: Widespread price fluctuation, fraud risk and misreporting of prices are understandably of concern to consumers, whilst the pressure to offer incredible deals does seem to have led some marketers to abandon best practice. Black Friday? Slack Friday, more like. It appears that UK shoppers (sensibly) decided to stay in bed rather than queue in the dark to pick up some bargains. On Oxford Street in London, one solitary shopper hovered nervously outside Curry\u2019s PC World, before the doors were flung open with a flourish. It\u2019s a similar scene online, as my colleague Sarah Butler explains: The number of shoppers online between midnight and 7am dived 24% on last year according to e-commerce trends service PCA Predict after an 11% rise in shopping over the previous week. \u201cThis longer sales period has shifted the emphasis away from Black Friday being a major retail event in its own right, towards becoming part of a pre-Christmas mini season or \u201cGolden Quarter\u201d for retailers,\u201d said Chris Boaz, \u200ehead of marketing of PCA Predict. Evidence of a slow start in the UK to the US-inspired discount day, was also seen on the high street as retail experts pointed empty stores at chains which had opened early to prepare for queues of bargain hunters. Quite a contrast with three years ago, when there were scuffles at branches of Tesco and Sainsbury as customers scrambled for a bargain. High street chain Next doesn\u2019t seem to be taking Black Friday terribly seriously either... Just in: UK mortgage approvals have hit their lowest level since September 2016. Banks approved 40,488 loans for house purchases in October, down from 41,576 in September. However, there was a big jump in the number of households who remortgaged their homes, ahead of this month\u2019s interest rate rise. Credit card lending growth also slowed, , in another sign that UK people are being more cautious about economic prospects. German business confidence has jumped again, in a sign that the European recovery is sizzling away. In a stark contrast with Britain\u2019s worried consumers, bosses in Europe\u2019s largest economy are very upbeat despite the collapse of coalition talks this month. The monthly gauge of German business confidence leaped to 117.5 this month, the highest level in many decades. Firms\u2019 expectations of current conditions dipped a little, but they\u2019re very optimistic about their future prospects. Ifo chief Clemens Fuest says: \u201cSentiment among German businesses is very strong,\u201d \u201cThis was due to far more optimistic business expectations. The German economy is on track for a boom.\u201d UK retailer Sports Direct has called a shareholder meeting, to vote on whether to pay \u00a311m to the brother of founder Mike Ashley. An internal review of links between Sports Direct and John Ashley has concluded that he had actually been underpaid for several years. John Ashley\u2019s company, Barlin, was paid by Sports Direct to handle deliveries overseas. That arrangement was ended earlier this year, amid concern over corporate governance at Sports Direct. However, the review into the links found that John Ashley had unfairly missed out on significant bonuses and pay awards. Mike Ashley plans to abstain on the vote, and says he actually expects independent shareholders to oppose the payout. But to him, it\u2019s a matter of principle.... It\u2019s important for me to say that if John had owed \u00a31 to Sports Direct, I would have ensured any sum was repaid in full. I hope shareholders will therefore be reassured that everything is in order and that any concerns are laid to rest.\u201d The meeting is on 13th December, at Sports Direct\u2019s headquarters in Shirebrook. There\u2019s not much drama in the European stock markets this morning. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 has dropped by 15 points, or 0.2%. With excellent timing, Bank of England policymaker Silvana Tenreyro has said that future interest rate moves will largely be dictated by Brexit. In an interview with Bloomberg, Tenreyro explained that nothing could be ruled out in the Brexit era - a hint that rate cuts or hikes could be on the agenda. \u201cPeople up until recently thought that Brexit meant monetary policy would remain highly accommodative and interest rates would stay low forever. But Brexit might present other challenges that require the opposite. It might require an adjustment either way, and it\u2019s not obvious. That\u2019s something to be prepared for.\u201d Tenreyro, who joined the Bank\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee this summer, also explained that the MPC doesn\u2019t know how the economy will react to Britain\u2019s exit from the EU. \u201cBrexit will likely affect the supply side of the economy,. \u201cWe don\u2019t know how the demand side will respond. It depends on how households and companies react to the new normal, to the new potential. Shocks can hit the economy one way or the other and we will have to respond to that.\u201d UK consumers won\u2019t feel any more confident after reading today\u2019s front pages. Several newspapers are leading on yesterday\u2019s warning that Britain face a two-decade long pay squeeze. The Institute for Fiscal Studies reckons that we will be earning around \u00a3750 per year less in 2022-23 than in 2007-08, in real terms (adjusted for inflation). As economics editor Larry Elliott put it: Unless the economy performs better than expected, the IFS now thinks Britain is in danger of losing not just one, but getting on for two decades of earnings growth. This would be the equivalent of earnings being lower when John Major left Downing Street in 1997 than when Margaret Thatcher began 18 years of Conservative rule in 1979. Historically, it is without precedent. Today\u2019s survey shows a \u201cbig decline\u201d in UK consumer confidence this month, according to Stephen Harmston, head of YouGov reports. Harmston adds: There have been falls across the board \u2013 from how secure people feel in their jobs to what they think house prices will do \u2013 and the increased cost of living has put a big squeeze on people\u2019s household finances. Overall, these are a gloomy set of consumer confidence figures.\u201d This chart confirms that people are becoming edgier, particularly about their own household finances. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. UK consumers are feeling at their gloomiest since the immediate aftermath of the EU referendum last June. Pessimism is mounting over household finances, property prices, job security and business activity, according to a new survey from YouGov and the Centre for Economics and Business Research. Their monthly index of consumer confidence dropped sharply this month, from 109.3 to just 106.6. That\u2019s the same level as immediately after the Brexit vote, and the first monthly fall since June 2017. Christian Jaccarini, economist at the CEBR, says consumer confidence suffered a series of blows this month, including the Bank of England\u2019s decision to raise interest rates to 0.5%. The first interest rate hike in over a decade triggered fears that higher borrowing costs will compound the inflation-induced squeeze on household incomes. Simultaneously, higher rates and a housing market in slowdown are warning signals for many homeowners, who fear house price growth may be further dampened. With these economic headwinds set to persist, and the OBR forecasting a weaker growth, households are understandably worried.\u201d With these storm clouds gathering, shoppers may be reluctant to splash out in the sales today. That would be a blow to retailers who are pinning their hopes on a good Black Friday.

Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The prospect of political progress in Germany buoyed the euro on Friday afternoon, while the dollar continued to move lower.</p> <p>The news that Angela Merkel and her CDU-CSU party are set to meet with their former Social Democrat coalition partners acted as a pick me up for the euro, which surged 0.6% to a 2 month high against the dollar, while taking another 0.3% off the pound, pushing sterling to its worst price in more than a week. These gains took the edge off the DAX\u2019s own growth, with a 1% lunchtime surge halving to 0.5%; still, this keeps the German index above 13000, a level its struggled with for the past few sessions.</p> <p>As for the dollar, its drop against the euro was joined by a 0.4% decline against the pound, with cable climbing above $1.335 to hit its best price since the start of October. There are a few things dragging the greenback lower: a pair of weaker than forecast flash manufacturing and services PMIs; Wednesday\u2019s cautious Fed meeting minutes, which cast doubt not on a December rate rise, but the pace of any subsequent hikes; and a series of bearish notes from analysts, including those at Nomura and Morgan Stanley. Add on a Thanksgiving hangover and it was a grey Black Friday for the currency.</p> <p>The FTSE, meanwhile, continued to trail its peers \u2013 not just the Eurozone, but the Dow Jones, which rose 0.2% after the bell \u2013 dipping 0.1% as the day went on.

We also note the persistence of a wider differential of $6 per barrel (/bbl) between Brent and WTI recently, although we believe this differential is likely to be nominally smaller in 2018. We base our long-term price assumptions mostly on fundamental analysis including assessments of the marginal cost of oil and gas production, as well as supply and demand fundamentals, for example</p> <p> We continue to expect Brent and WTI to be range-bound in 2018. We note that Brent has been trading above $60/bbl since Oct. 27, 2017, having closed at that price on Sept. 25 for the first time since July 2015. As present, futures prices remain above $60/bbl until November 2018. We believe the price increases reflect ongoing OPEC production cuts, supply disruptions, and temporary production declines as well as positive market sentiment about demand. Shipments from northern Iraq were reportedly lower in October and production from several other regions was down as well. However, we assume these specific supply issues will be addressed in coming months. What\u2019s more, we believe that continuing production growth may marginally exceed consumption growth in 2018. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a181e1eed0cea0670bbe538\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-11-24T13:31:27.471Z\">1.31pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Tucking into some lunch at your desk, perhaps after a dash to Pret or Greggs?

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Sports Direct is facing criticism from unions and investors over a proposed \u00a311m payout to the brother of Mike Ashley, the company\u2019s founder and majority shareholder. Last year, Sports Direct was heavily criticised by its own shareholders and corporate governance experts after it emerged the sportswear retailer was paying a company owned by John Ashley to deliver online orders outside the UK. The arrangement with Barlin Delivery Ltd, which was unwound earlier this year, had not been disclosed in Sports Direct\u2019s annual report. In a statement to the Stock Exchange , Sports Direct said it wanted to pay John Ashley \u00a311m because he had been underpaid for previous work. It will hold a special shareholder meeting on 13 December at which independent shareholders will be given the chance to approve the payout. Mike Ashley, the Newcastle United boss who owns nearly 61% of Sports Direct, will abstain from the vote but made clear that he, and the rest of the retailer\u2019s board, were supportive of the payout. Sports Direct said it wanted to make the payment after asking its law firm, RPC, to review John Ashley\u2019s history with the company and the total \u201cpaid in money and in kind to John Ashley, which had been called into question given his position as brother of Mike Ashley\u201d. John Ashley, a computer science graduate, built Sports Direct\u2019s IT systems from scratch after joining his brother\u2019s business in 1989. Some independent shareholders said they would vote against the deal while unions criticised the planned payout in the face of ongoing disquiet over pay and conditions for Sports Direct\u2019s warehouse and store staff. Sports Direct said RPC\u2019s review, conducted with accountants Smith &amp; Williamson, had concluded that if John Ashley had been treated equally with other senior executives who had helped develop Sports Direct he would have received additional payments totalling about \u00a311m. It said he had been denied this \u201cbecause of concerns at the time about public relations\u201d. The money deemed owed to John Ashley reportedly relates to a \u00a35m bonus linked to Sports Direct\u2019s 2007 flotation and a later performance-related share award worth \u00a36.8m. Mike Ashley said in the statement: \u201cI fully expect that independent shareholders will vote against this proposal due to the passage of time involved, although in my opinion, technically the money is owed and therefore should be paid. \u201cIt\u2019s important for me to say that if John had owed \u00a31 to Sports Direct, I would have ensured any sum was repaid in full. I hope shareholders will therefore be reassured that everything is in order and that any concerns are laid to rest.\u201d When news of the contract with Barlin emerged, it spurred shareholder unease about corporate governance of Sports Direct that had already been fuelled by Mike Ashley\u2019s decision to put his daughter\u2019s boyfriend in charge of the firm\u2019s property team. The company has also faced criticism over the treatment of workers. Thousands of Sports Direct warehouse workers were awarded about \u00a31m in back pay after a Guardian investigation revealed the company was effectivelybelow the minimum wage. Steve Turner, of the Unite union, which has campaigned for better pay and conditions for Sports Direct workers, said some were still waiting for their share of back pay from the employment agency they were hired through. He said: \u201cIf Mike Ashley is so concerned about ensuring his brother gets the back pay he says he is entitled to, why not the agency workers at Sport Direct\u2019s Shirebrook warehouse? The company also said on Friday it wanted to approve a \u00a33-a-share minimum payout to executives Karen Byers and Sean Nevitt \u2013 the only remaining participants in the Sports Direct executive bonus share scheme \u2013 if they elect to exercise their shares before September 2018, or \u00a34 a share after that month. Sports Direct shareholder Royal London said it would not support the share deal for executives or the payout to John Ashley. Ashley Hamilton Claxton, the head of responsible investment at Royal London Asset Management, said: \u201cIf appropriate governance measures were in place at Sports Direct in the first place, there would have been a clear and transparent process for paying John Ashley what he was due and there would be no need to review his compensation after the fact.\u201d It said Sports Direct had not provided evidence or detail explaining why the \u00a311m was owed. Aberdeen Standard Investments said it would find it \u201creally hard to support\u201d the payout as it was a \u201csignificant amount of money for services already rendered\u201d. Paul Lee, its head of corporate governance, said: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t really make any sense.\u201d The battle over the payout to John Ashley is the latest in a series of tussles with shareholders and unions over corporate governance. In the wake of the revelations about Barlin, independent shareholders last year voted out Sports Direct\u2019s chairman, Keith Hellawell, but he stayed in his job with the backing of Mike Ashley.",

      "bodyText": "British banks approved the fewest mortgages for house purchases in more than a year in October, with economists warning the decline could signal the start of a downturn in the UK housing market. Mortgage approvals fell to a 13-month low of 40,488 last month, down from 41,576 in September, according to the industry trade body UK Finance. Samuel Tombs, the chief UK economist at consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the Bank of England\u2019s decision earlier this month to raise interest rates for the first time in more than a decade, to 0.5% from 0.25%, would probably exacerbate the downward trend. \u201cThis appears to be just the start of a bigger downturn,\u201d Tombs said. \u201cHousing market activity likely has cooled further in recent weeks, given that mortgage rates have moved swiftly higher and consumer confidence has weakened since the hike by the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee.\u201d The chancellor\u2019s decision to cut stamp duty for first-time buyers would do little to counter this downturn, primarily because it is expected to push up house prices, Tombs said. Howard Archer, the chief economic adviser to the forecasting group EY Item Club, said the mortgage approval figures were the latest evidence of \u201clacklustre housing market activity\u201d, after new buyer enquiries fell in October at their fastest pace since July 2016, according to the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. He said cash-strapped consumers were reluctant to commit to major purchases at a time when real pay was falling, as shop prices rise faster than wages. \u201cIt is also very possible that the recent Bank of England interest rate hike will weigh down on housing market activity,\u201d Archer added. \u201cWhile the increase in interest rates was just 0.25% and mortgage rates are still at historically very low levels, it could have a significant effect on housing market psychology.\u201d EY Item Club is forecasting house price growth of about 2-3% in 2018, underpinned by a shortage of homes for sale, high employment, and mortgage interest rates that remain historically low. It was a different story for existing homeowners, who rushed to remortgage in October, before the Bank\u2019s highly anticipated rate rise in November. There were 34,036 loans approved for remortgaging last month, according to UK Finance. That was up by 11.6% compared with September, and 37% higher than at the same point last year. \u201cThe anticipated bank rate rise saw a flurry of remortgage activity as many homeowners took advantage of the competitive rates on offer,\u201d said Mohammad Jamei, the trade body\u2019s senior economist. Annual growth in credit card lending slowed to 5.1% in October from 5.5% in September. Meanwhile, non-financial businesses repaid a net \u00a31.5bn of debt last month, the largest since February, in a sign that businesses are becoming more cautious about investing when the outcome of Brexit negotiations is far from clear. \u201cIn terms of saving, consumer deposits grew at a slower rate in October, while businesses have continued the trend of bolstering their cash reserves amidst a cautious business landscape due to Brexit uncertainties,\u201d Jamei said.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "High street sales are staging a recovery after a sharp slowdown last month, overcoming the steepest growth in selling prices in almost 25 years. Grocers and clothing retailers fuelled stronger sales in November in the Confederation of British Industry\u2019s survey of retail activity, which had recorded sales for October falling at the fastest rate since the height of the recession in 2009. While the study comes before the key Christmas shopping period, the early indications are likely to cheer the industry. The CBI said 39% of the 128 retailers it polled reported an increase in sales volumes this month compared with a year ago, while 13% saw a decline, leaving a rounded balance of +26%. The closing date for the survey was Tuesday 14 November, well before the beginning of the Black Friday discounting period, which is expected to help drive sales further. British shoppers are expected to spend as much as \u00a310.1bn during the US-inspired week of special offers and promotions, nearly 4% higher than last year as more retailers take part. The CBI survey found the strongest growth in prices since May 1991, with a balance of +75% of retailers seeing higher prices in the year to November and an expectation that they will rise further. It also found that optimism among businesses is declining and retailers are taking on fewer staff. Rain Newton-Smith, the chief economist at the CBI, said: \u201cOur high streets are not out of the woods. Ahead of the crucial run-up to Christmas, the weaker pound has pushed up prices and retailers are nervous about business conditions and are trimming their workforces.\u201d The study comes after the Office for National Statisticsfound the rate of growth in household consumption expenditure strengthened to 0.6% in the three months to the end of September, including a recovery of car purchases. That helped drive the slightly stronger-than-expected growth in the economy of 0.4% in the third quarter, confirmed by the ONS on Thursday. But the situation facing consumers remains highly challenging, which could slow growth in the future. British households are facing the biggest squeeze on living standards since records began, according to the Resolution Foundation, amid rising inflation due to the pound\u2019s weakness since the Brexit vote. Samuel Tombs, the chief UK economist at the consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: \u201cWe strongly doubt that consumers, hit by rapidly rising prices, higher interest rates and slowing employment growth, will be able to keep increasing their overall real spending.\u201d Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

The closing date for the survey was Tuesday 14 November, well before the beginning of the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/nov/17/black-friday-2017-best-uk-deals-offer\">Black Friday discounting period</a>, which is expected to help drive sales further. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/nov/17/uk-shoppers-forecast-to-spend-10bn-in-black-friday-sales\">UK shoppers forecast to spend \u00a310bn in Black Friday sales</a> </p> </aside>  <p>British shoppers are expected to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/nov/17/uk-shoppers-forecast-to-spend-10bn-in-black-friday-sales\">spend as much as \u00a310.1bn</a> during the US-inspired week of special offers and promotions, nearly 4% higher than last year as more retailers take part.</p> <p>The CBI survey found the strongest growth in prices since May 1991, with a balance of +75% of retailers seeing higher prices in the year to November and an expectation that they will rise further. It also found that optimism among businesses is declining and retailers are taking on fewer staff. </p> <p>Rain Newton-Smith, the chief economist at the CBI, said: \u201cOur high streets are not out of the woods. Ahead of the crucial run-up to Christmas, the weaker pound has pushed up prices and retailers are nervous about business conditions and are trimming their workforces.\u201d</p> <p>The study comes after the Office for National Statisticsfound the rate of <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/grossdomesticproductgdp/bulletins/secondestimateofgdp/julytoseptember2017\">growth in household consumption expenditure</a> strengthened to 0.6% in the three months to the end of September, including a recovery of car purchases. That helped drive the slightly stronger-than-expected growth in the economy of 0.4% in the third quarter, confirmed by the ONS on Thursday.</p> <p>But the situation facing consumers remains highly challenging, which could slow growth in the future. British households are facing the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/nov/23/uk-fall-living-standards-resolution-foundation-budget\">biggest squeeze on living standards</a> since records began, according to the Resolution Foundation, amid <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/oct/17/uk-inflation-at-five-year-high-of-3-to-boost-state-pension\">rising inflation</a> due to the pound\u2019s weakness since the Brexit vote.</p> <p>Samuel Tombs, the chief UK economist at the consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: \u201cWe strongly doubt that consumers, hit by rapidly rising prices, higher interest rates and slowing employment growth, will be able to keep increasing their overall real spending.\u201d<br></p> <ul> <li>Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BusinessDesk\">@BusinessDesk</a>, or sign up to the daily Business Today email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2017/may/16/guardian-business-today-sign-up-financial-news-email?CMP=business_footnote\">here</a>.<br></li> </ul>",

      "bodyText": "Hang out with executives from water companies and you\u2019ll quickly learn than everybody loathes Thames Water. Insiders blame the firm for spoiling the reputation of the entire industry. They wonder if Labour\u2019s calls for re-nationalisation would score so well in opinion polls if Thames hadn\u2019t so precisely fulfilled the caricature of a privatised water utility \u2013 the one that draws firms as financial engineers who pay fat dividends to offshore owners while short-changing customers. Not all those peers have pristine records themselves, but you can understand why they point at Thames. The company\u2019s current corporate structure is baffling to ordinary mortals. Two Cayman Islands entities sit below the regulated utility and a chain of five companies stands between the main company and its shareholders. Complexity is one reason why it was impossible for outsiders to calculate the returns made by Macquarie during its decade as Thames\u2019 dominant shareholder. Nobody, however, disputes that the Australian financial house made a packet. Meanwhile, Thames was fined \u00a38.5m in June for leaking water at a rate regulator Ofwat called \u201cunacceptable\u201d. That followed a \u00a320.3m fine in March for pumping huge quantities of raw sewage into rivers in 2012 and 2013; the judge called the company\u2019s actions \u201cborderline deliberate\u201d. Things had got so bad that the Ofwat chairman, Jonson Cox, took the unusual step of writing a column in trade paper Utility Week in the summer that called on Thames \u201cto make a step change in the way it operates and behaves\u201d. Cox set out five commitments and urged the company to adopt them \u201cquickly\u201d. The penny \u2013 finally \u2013 has dropped. Ian Marchant, former boss of energy group SSE, was unveiled as the new chairman of Thames on Thursday and, reading between the lines, seems to have accepted the job on the condition that the corporate structure is reformed. The Cayman subsidiaries will be closed and the new set-up made \u201cas simple and transparent as possible\u201d. That should tick one of Cox\u2019s boxes. Other measures, such as getting more independent voices in the boardroom, seem to be in hand. The goal of meeting leakage targets now sounds more credible, even if it probably won\u2019t happen this year. Time to relax and take comfort in Ofwat\u2019s powers to hold water companies to account? Hardly. It is alarming how often Thames, when it is championing its \u201cnew vision\u201d, goes out of its way to emphasise that \u201cnew long-term major investors\u201d, such as well-regarded Canadian fund manager Borealis, have taken the place of Macquarie. Cox himself noted Macquarie\u2019s exit in his editorial and welcomed the arrival of Borealis. \u201cResponsible investors can benefit from helping us drive performance up and prices down,\u201d he said. What are they trying to say? That reform and greater transparency was impossible while Macquarie was on the scene? That the system only works well if \u201cresponsible\u201d investors are in control? If so, outsiders will naturally conclude that the regulatory system has been shockingly weak for years and is still too light. That, rather than simply Thames\u2019 excesses and failures, may explain why nationalisation is suddenly popular. British Gas share price proffers fuel for thought Iain Conn, chief executive of Centrica, has already cut shareholders\u2019 dividend once during his three-year stint \u2013 by 30%, no less, in 2015. Will he be forced to reach for his axe again? After a 15% plunge in the share price after an out-of-leftfield profits warning, the dividend yield is now an extraordinary 8.7%. Investors fear the worst. The alarming aspect of Thursday\u2019s warning was that the financial pain was concentrated in parts of Centrica that used to be seen as vaguely reliable. The North American operation, delivering power to big industrial plants, is suffering from fresh competition. The equivalent UK business-focused division is also grumbling about competitors and warm weather and will only break even this year. By contrast, the UK supply business \u2013 the division that may or may not be hit with price caps on energy bills \u2013 lost 823,000 customers between July and October but full-year operating profits are still set to match those of 2016. The escapees from British Gas seem to have been those the company didn\u2019t mind leaving \u2013 low-margin customers. Despite the alarm in the share price, the dividend is clearly safe for now. Centrica says cashflow will be \u201cat least\u201d \u00a32bn this year. Capital expenditure is capped at \u00a31bn. That leaves room to pay a dividend costing \u00a3650m. Yet, in per-share terms, the dividend is 12p and earnings will be 12.5p. That\u2019s horribly tight. Attempting to reassure shareholders, Centrica says it is prepared to run with thin dividend cover \u201cfor a period of time\u201d. How long is that? Clarity is promised with full-year figures in February, but you can\u2019t blame shareholders for worrying: it\u2019s one damn thing after another at Centrica these days. The share price is 138p. It was 380p when Ed Miliband starting talking about price caps four years ago. Next joins the Black Friday throng Proof, in case you needed it, that times are tough for high street retailers: Next, previously a refuge from the Black Friday madness, is joining the throng. Its event may be a restrained affair, at least by the standards of some rivals, and it may just be used as a chance to shift a few slow-selling lines that would have ended up in the Boxing Day sale. But Next, with a view to protecting its brand and its margins, used to be a firm hold-out against Black Friday. The new stance is a weak signal for the whole clothing sector.",
