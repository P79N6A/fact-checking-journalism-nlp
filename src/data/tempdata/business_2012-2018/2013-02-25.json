In a highly critical 17-page letter rejecting Reckitt's citizen petition (pdf), the FDA dismissed the group's new evidence and called into question its motives, even referring the matter to investigators at the Federal Trade Commission. \"The timing of Reckitt's September 2012 announcement that it would discontinue marketing of the tablet product because of paediatric exposure issues, given its close alignment with the period in which generic competition for this product was expected to begin, cannot be ignored,\" wrote Janet Woodcock, director of the FDA's Centre for Drug Evaluation and Research.

But the pace of openings is set to slow, with the focus switching to expanding the size of its current 257 sites at more prime locations. Analysts remain impressed with the company's performance. Peter Saville, partner at restructuring firm Zolfo Cooper, said: \"Primark's stellar success flies in the face of conventional wisdom. Whilst the rest of the retail world is obsessing over online selling and multichannel strategies, Primark is powering ahead despite it having no online business at all.\" Others are cautious that the speed of growth will now start to slow. AB Foods, which also owns brands such as Twinings tea and Kingsmill bread, has been outperforming its rivals, with shares hitting an all-time high of \u00a318.64 last week.",

    "webTitle": "Bruising day for the pound after UK's AAA downgrade - as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "All eyes are on Italy tonight, as a steady stream of projections and voting results show that the general election is neck-and-neck, and neck. Here's the latest projections for the Chamber of Deputies: Centre-left coalition (Bersani): 29.1% Centre-right coalition (Berlusconi): 28.6% Five Star Movement (Grillo): 26.3% it's going to be a long night, and possibly a dramatic Tuesday in the financial markets. We'll be tracking the events in our live blog through the evening: Italian election results: exit polls show left ahead \u2013 live coverage. Until then, with Britain bearing up well with the loss of her AAA rating, I'm off. Thanks for all the comments, and goodnight! A closing round-up from the financial markets, on a day when Britain's AAA rating downgrade was overshadowed by the unfolding drama in Italy, where the election is currently too close to call. The pound has had a bruising day. It's currently down three quarters of a cent against the euro, at \u20ac1.1489, having hit its lowest levels in 16 months today. And against the US dollar, the pound is trading at $1.5145 having hit two-and-a-half year lows below $1.51 this morning. And in the stock markets: FTSE 100: up 19 points at 6355, + 0.3% Italian FTSE MIB: up 118 points at 16351, + 0.73% German DAX: up 111 points at 7773, +1.45% French CAC: up 15 points at 3721, +0.4% Spanish IBEX: up 65 points at 8244, +0.8% UK sovereign debt actually strengthened in late trading, pushing down the yield (interest rate) on British 10-year gilts by 3.5 percentage points. 10-year gilts are now changing hands at 2.078% - which will be music to chancellor Osborne's ears. The AAA rating may have been lost, but it's not prompted an immediate surge in UK borrowing costs. This is partly due to rising alarm over the Italian elections, where officials are talking about needing a new vote! (more on our Italian liveblog) Independent economist Shaun Richards explains: Osborne, of course, made that prediction many times. Wondering how Britain's downgrade, and the fall in the pound, affects you? My colleague Hilary Osborne has the answers here: How the loss of Britain's triple-A credit rating will affect consumers (savers who enjoy holidaying across the Channel should take a deep breath first) Those twists and turns in the Italian general election have helped sterling recover some ground against the euro - but the pound is still down 1% at \u20ac1.143. The pound is also heading for its lowest closing level against the US dollar in two and a half years, at just over $1.51. So not a great day for sterling. No wonder Osborne decided against talking the pound down - it can fall perfectly well on its own! One more interesting line to flag up from George Osborne's session in parliament - asked about the possible impact on sterling of the Moody's downgrade, the chancellor cited the G7's recent promise not to conduct a currency war. That ought to please his predecessor, Lord Lawson (who ran the Treasury between June 1983 and October 1989). Yesterday, Lawson said it would be a disaster for ministers or central bankers (yes, you, Mervyn King) to suggest that a weak pound would be useful. As Lawson put it: I think it would be a very great mistake if anyone in the government or Bank of England gave the impression we would like to see a further depreciation of sterling. That would not be clever; that would not be sensible; that would not be helpful. New projections from the Italian general election have completely punctured the rally in Milan. The news that Silvio Berlusconi's centre-right coalition is thought to be ahead in the Senate has pushed the FTSE MIB into negative territory; an hour ago, it was up 4%. Paul Owen has the details: Senate: Centre-right coalition: 31.7% Centre-left coalition: 29% Five Star Movement: 25.1% Centrist coalition: 8.5% More on Paul's rolling coverage: Italian election results \u2013 live coverage The key line from George Osborne is that he's not going to change the pace of his deficit reduction plan; otherwise, a bad situation would be even worse. Ed Balls, shadow chancellor, is arguing that the government is illogical, having previously insisted that its plan A was essential in order to keep the AAA rating. Osborne, though, claims Balls is the man without an economic plan: \"His answer to a debt crisis is to borrow more,\" Osborne says. Good knockabout stuff (it's on Sky News and BBC Parliament), and on Andrew Sparrow's blog. Over in Parliament, Ed Balls is demanding an urgent answer from George Osborne on Britain's economic policy after the loss of the AAA rating. Andrew Sparrow is live-blogging all the action here from parliament: Osborne begins by pointing out that UK bond yields are stable today, and that the FTSE 100 is up: there is no panic in the markets, he says. And then he's swiftly into the politics, saying Moody's is encouraging him to continue \"the process of winding down the huge debts built up over the last decade\". There is plenty of speculation that the pound is heading to parity with the euro (it got to \u20ac1.02 at the end of 2008). Ladbrokes has now weighed in, offering odds of just 6/4 that sterling falls to \u20ac1 or lower this year (from below \u20ac1.14 now). It also offers just 4/1 on the pound slumping to parity against the US dollar. That would only happen if there was a remarkable run on the pound this year - so the odds feel a little ungenerous. Still, you may have other thoughts \u2026 Another important development to flag up in Ireland: a breakthrough in the Irish government's bid to slash its massive public pay bill as part of the IMF/EU/ECB austerity programme. The deal means bigger pay cuts for higher earners, as Henry McDonald reports from Dublin: During talks to revise the so-called Croke Park Agreement between the state and public sector trade unions it has been agreed that government employees earning more than \u20ac185,000 per annum will take a 10% pay cut. Overall pay cuts will kick in for state workers at 5.5% for those earning more than \u20ac65,000 up to the 10% ceiling for the highest earners. The Irish public sector is one of the most highly paid in the industrialised world and has one of the best, most generous pension systems. The Fine Gael-Labour government has been under tremendous pressure from the so called troika of the IMF, EU and ECB to reform its public sector and slash wages. The deal, if agreed by a series of ballots of public sector-based unions, will run from July 2013 until 2016. Ireland's minister for public expenditure, Brendan Howlin, said: \"These proposals constitute a fair and balanced agenda to repair our public finances. \"The revised measures recommended by the LRC (Labour Relations Commission) meet the budgetary targets of the government and address many of the concerns expressed by the staff representatives during the negotiations.\" Back to Britain, and here's a video clip of a defiant George Osborne saying he won't \"run away\" from Britain's problems, and insisting that the situation would be even worse if he changed his policies. Bank shares are leading the rally in Italy, gaining at least 6% each. Trading in Monte dei Paschi Siena, Italy's oldest bank, which has been hit by a major scandal, has just been paused because its shares jumped so strongly. And shares in Mediaset, the media empire owned by Silvio Berluconi, are up by over 8%. For full coverage of the Italian election, check out Paul Owen's rolling blog. The Italian stock market has jumped since the exit polls came out. It's up 3.9%, or 636 points, at 16870. The euro has also jumped, now up 1 cent against the US dollar at $1.329. The exit polls from Italy are in, and the stock markets are rallying hard. The top line is that the centre-left Democratic party has won the most votes in races for both the upper and lower house, with a clear lead over Silvio Berlusconi's party. The second key development is that Mario Monti, the technocratic PM parachuted in to run Italy, has been rejected by the public. Bebbe Grillo's Five Star Movement has won much more support. Here are the projections for the lower house, from SkyTG 24 Democratic Party: 34.5% Berlusconi's coalition: 29% Five Star Movement: 19% Monti's centrist coalition: 9.5% And for Senate Democratic Party: 37% Berlusconi's coalition: 31% Five Star Movement: 16.5% Monti's centrist coalition: 9% Just half an hour until the voting closes in Italy and we get the exit polls from a general election that will help to determine the future of the eurozone financial crisis. Robert O\u2019Daly, Italy analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit, reckons this is \"arguably the most important [election[ since the start of the country's membership of the euro.\" A stable, reformist government is hoped for, but there is a high risk of a hung parliament with Mr Bersani's centre-left winning a majority in the lower house but unable to form a majority in the upper house, even with the added support of outgoing prime minister Monti's centrists. My colleague Paul Owen is blogging the results here: Italian election results \u2013 live coverage. In Ireland, the government has been warned not to look upon \u20ac1bn they saved from the IOU bill on the busted Anglo Irish Bank as a \"windfall\". Henry McDonald reports from Dublin: Olli Rehn, the EU's commissioner on economic and monetary matters, said the money should not be used to lighten the load of next year's Irish budget. Rehn's intervention this morning will be viewed in Dublin as a sign that the EU, alongside with the European Central Bank and the IMF, still calls the shots when it comes to Ireland's fiscal policies. Speaking on RT\u00c9's Morning Ireland programme, Rehn said the money should not be used to \"soften\" next year's budget. Rehn said it was important that Ireland stick to the EU/IMF programme, which has imposed austerity cuts and reduced public spending. The EU commissioner said he was surprised the savings had been described in some quarters as \"windfall gains\". He said it was important that the Irish government be consistent in its fiscal policies, and continue to implement measures to reduce the debt burden. After Ireland secured a deal on the so-called promissory notes to bondholders of the defunct Anglo Irish Bank, some have been urging Enda Kenny and his coalition partners to spend the saved \u20ac1bn on capital building projects to help stimulate domestic demand in the republic. Those are just the kind of projects City investors want to see from George Osborne (see 10.02am for more details) The relatively muted reaction to the UK's downgrade bolsters the argument that rating agencies simply get too much attention. Moody's doesn't have a souped-up Delorean hidden in the basement; it's simply working off the same indicators and forecasts as everyone else. Except a trader or fund manager can take a decision, and execute it, a lot faster than an agency typically manages. Vince Cable, the business secretary, dismissed the downgrade as \"largely symbolic\" yesterday \u2013 which was certainly not the tune Osborne has been singing for years (Labour provides a round-up here). But supporters of the chancellor say he managed to protect the AAA when it mattered most. Back in January 2012, my colleague Aditya Chakrabortty wrote perhaps the definitive take-down of the cult of the rating agency: Time to take control of the credit rating agencies. Why should S&amp;P and Moody's earn such vast sums? Certainly not for their oracular genius \u2013 the agencies have as much foresight as Mr Magoo. In my working life, the credit-rating duopoly has failed to warn investors about the Asian financial crisis, Enron, the subprime crisis, Lehman Brothers \u2013 and Greece. My particular favourite, Moody's report dates from December 2009 and is titled \"Investor fears over Greek government liquidity misplaced\". Six months later, Athens received a $147bn rescue package. Not much has changed over the last year, alas. The EU did agree new rules to control the agencies last year, but tougher measures were watered down. Sterling continues to sink against the euro today - partly due to the Moody's downgrade, and partly due to optimism that the Italian general election will deliver a stable election (see 11.40am) The pound is now down 1.75 euro cents at \u20ac1.139, a tumble of 1.5% since trading began. That's the lowest level since October 2011. A weaker pound is a blow to those of you planning a holiday on the continent, but should provide a boost to exporters. Many firms, though, have argued that they'd rather have simple certainty about the pound's value over the next couple of years (also, if you buy raw materials or certain parts from Europe, a weaker pound can be a handicap). There's speculation in parliament this afternoon that George Osborne may miss the urgent question on the downgrade, owing to an unfortunate clash with his pre-scheduled skit at the inquiry into banking: The opposition would love that! My learned colleague Andrew Sparrow is on the case from parliament (his Politics live blog is here) Labour has got its way - George Osborne will have to answer an urgent question about Britain's downgrade, at 3.30pm. Over in Westminster, the Labour party is trying to thwart George Osborne's efforts to keep his head down. The opposition is reportedly planning to haul the chancellor to parliament to answer an urgent parliamentary question on the Moody's downgrade of the UK credit rating. Osborne won't be able to avoid discussing the situation today \u2013 he's due to appear at a parliamentary inquiry into Britain's banking sector at 3.45pm GMT (it will be streamed live here) Sky News's Ed Conway neatly sums up the market reaction to the UK's triple-A downgradey: Apocalypse No. Italy sold \u20ac2.82bn of bonds this morning, in another sign that the financial markets are optimistic about today's general election. The two-year bonds were shifted at an average yield of 1.68%, with traders bidding for 1.65 times the amount of debt on offer. That's a good result, according to the RBS credit strategist Alberto Gallo. The big story in the eurozone crisis is the Italian general election. Polls in Italy close at 2pm GMT (3pm local time), at which point we'll be swamped with exit poll data. That will be fascinating, especially as opinion polls have been outlawed for the last two weeks. The crucial questions is whether the centre-left Democratic party has won an outright majority in both the lower house of parliament and in the senate. Intriguingly, voter turnout was lower in early voting yesterday than at the previous election. Political analysts say it was notably down in areas where Silvio Berlusconi has enjoyed solid support. That may mean the Democratic party performs well, perhaps giving its leader, Pier Luigi Bersani, a clear majority. However, the wild card in the election is the Five Star Movement, whose comedian leader, Beppe Grillo, has won supporters with a message of radical change, including a plan for a referendum on Italy's eurozone membership. If Grillo wins a substantial share of the vote, he could win enough seats to deny Bersani that majority, perhaps forcing a coalition with Mario Monti. Right now, the euro is rallying as traders conclude that Silvio Berlusconi has not had a good election. it's up 0.64% against the US dollar and 1.3% against the pound (one reason sterling fell to a 17-month low). The whole election could depend on Lombardy, in the north of the country. Dubbed the Italian Ohio (the US state where American presidential elections are often decided), it could give Bersani the keys to the Senate - if he wins first place there. Fail, and he may need to form a coalition. The FTSE 100 index continues to rally today, up 35 points at 6371. My colleague Nick Fletcher writes that the blue-chip index is showing its global credentials again, with hopes of more monetary easing boosting shares prices. For a start, comments from US Federal Reserve officials late on the same day spelt out the merits of its bond-buying programme, prompting hopes of continuing stimulus for the world's largest economy. And in Japan, sentiment was boosted by talk that the next central bank governor could be Haruhiko Kuroda, Asian Development Bank president, who is an advocate of aggressive monetary easing. And with a survey showing Chinese manufacturing growing for the fourth month - albeit slipping back from two-year highs - the mining sector was given a lift. Good news for George Osborne (and the rest of Britain, really): UK sovereign bonds have swiftly recovered from the loss of the AAA rating at Moody's. After an early rise, UK bond yields have sunk back to Friday's levels - suggesting the downgrade has had no short-term impact on British borrowing costs (borrowing for 10 years costs around 2.1% a year). A quick update on sterling: \u2022 Against the US dollar, the pound is stable and pretty fat at around $1.51. It initially slumped to its lowest levels since July 2010, in early trading in Asia, but clawed its way back as European traders got to work. \u2022 But against the euro, the pound has shed more than 1% this morning to \u20ac1.1433. That means one euro's now worth 87.4p. \u2022 The Bank of England's own 'trade-weighted' measure of sterling (valuing the pound against a range of other currencies) has been pulled down to its lowest level since September 2011. So, certainly not a run on the pound: few currency traders are breaking sweat. As explained at 8.56am, the financial markets had been expecting a downgrade, and the weakness of the UK economy had pushed sterling down steadily through the year, as this graph shows. George Osborne spent the weekend insisting that he would not abandon his deficit-reduction targets in the light of the downgrade. However, some City analysts and investors believe, and hope, that the chancellor will announce more measures to stimulate growth. M&amp;G's retail bond team reckon Moody's may have done Osborne a favour by shooting the AAA now: Gemma Godfrey, head of investment strategy at Brooks Macdonald, told me lat night that investors wanted to see Osborne announce new infrastructure spending in next month's budget. She explained: The markets are more focused on growth than on deficit reduction \u2026 As an investor in a low-growth environment, you're looking for any areas that can give you growth. The emphasis should be to kickstart growth, because without growth our debt levels will be very hard to manage. Godfrey pointed out that infrastructure spend is classified as \"capital\" rather than \"current\" spending, giving Osborne the opportunity to announce fresh spending plans. An interesting accounting quirk could come to the rescue: infrastructure spend is classified as 'capital', not 'current', spending, and with a \u00a33 boost to the economy per \u00a31 spent, the pressure could encourage a strategy of investing for growth and companies that benefit could see profits boosted. Alternatively, the risk is that too great a focus on deficit reduction could further squeeze the economy and domestic corporate revenues. With Fitch due to rule on Britain's AAA after the budget, Osborne needs to play a blinder. Jane Foley of Rabobank comments: While Chancellor Osborne at the weekend pledged not to err from his austerity course, this is not a path supported by all members of the coalition, so the news raises the risk for intra-government tension, which could in itself undermine the pound. The 20 March budget is the perfect opportunity for the chancellor to lay out his response to the \u2018growth v austerity' arguments, which now have fresh momentum. These policies will be crucial in determining whether other credit ratings agencies decide whether or not to downgrade the UK further. European stock markets have completely shrugged off the UK downgrade: FTSE 100: up 45 points at 6381, + 0.7% German DAX: up 72 points at 7734, +0.95% French CAC: up 16 points at 3722, + 0.4% Spanish IBEX: up 52 points at 8233, + 0.67% Italian FTSE MIB: up 138 points at 16372, +0.8% Paul Donovan, managing director of Global Economics at UBS, refuses to get excited about the downgrade, telling clients in a research note: One of the credit rating agencies downgraded the UK from AAA for some reason or another. The government responded with complete indifference, which will likely be the reaction of investors. It's certainly true that the pound remains stable against the US dollar this morning, at $1.515. City analysts are in broad agreement that the loss of Britain's AAA rating was 'priced in'. Here's a round-up of the early comment: Kit Juckes of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale said: Let's start at home. Firstly, the risk of a UK default is no higher today than it was a week ago and remains incredibly low, simply because the pound can act as a shock absorber. That's the beauty of this floating currency thingy, which only becomes a problem in a real rout (think GBP/USD below parity). Secondly, the downgrade was so well flagged that surely it is priced in. And thirdly, while this does harm to the UK chancellor's credibility, the rating agencies have already trashed their credibility irredeemably. Juckes added, though, that the pound looks \"for all the world\" as if it could drop to $1.40 against the US dollar in the longer term. Louise Cooper of CooperCity says the downgrade proves that, without growth, the UK's debt figures look \"very nasty\": The UK is not a safe haven, it only became one because the rest of Europe looked so scary, the UK was relatively safe. But thanks to [the European Central Bank president Mario] Draghi, the risks of a eurozone implosion have reduced, at least for the time being. Therefore the risks of the UK, by itself, are back in the spotlight. At different times in history and the economic cycle, particular data becomes more or less important . I am old enough to remember the money supply-targeting of the Thatcher years. For the UK, the data to watch very closely currently is any indicator of future output/GDP and the monthly government debt figures. The UK is on a tightrope, with little in the way of a safety net. Wobbles could easily become catastrophic. Osborne: hold on tight to that balancing pole. Gary Jenkins of Swordfish Research believes the Moody's downgrade could set the tone for the year: So, there we have it: officially we are now Good Britain; no longer Great, I\u2019m afraid. Oh well, it had to happen sooner or later, and it\u2019s nice that S&amp;P let Moody\u2019s go first this time. The key drivers of the downgrade were: 'continued weakness in the medium-term growth outlook, challenges that subdued growth poses to the government\u2019s fiscal consolidation programme, and, as a consequence of the UK\u2019s high and rising debt burden, a \u2018deterioration in the shock-absorption capacity of the government\u2019s balance sheet \u2026' Difficult to argue with that. And if the economic data across much of Europe continues to be as poor as it has over the last few months, then I think we shall see these lines repeated by the agencies in 2013. Kathleen Brooks, research director at Forex.com, said the downgrade \"reinforces the perilous economic position the UK is in\": This downgrade may fuel more speculation that QE will be restarted later this year. This is pound negative for the medium term, and we could see sub-$1.50 in the near term. Britain's sovereign debt has also weakened this morning, but not dramatically. The yield on UK 10-year gilts is up to 2.15%, from 2.1% on Friday. In broad terms, the yield is the interest rate on a bond - so it indicates that UK borrowing costs are now higher. However, they are still extremely low, in historical terms. The broader question is whether the loss of the AAA has a longer-term impact. As Paul Griffiths, co-global head of fixed income at Aberdeen Asset Management, put it over the weekend: It is certainly a different situation to when the US was downgraded and treasury bill yields and the dollar rallied. Investors viewed the decision as a sign of deteriorating global growth and continued to see US treasuries as a safe haven. The UK does not have that same status. City experts reckon the weekend chatter about a new sterling crisis (see below) was somewhat overblown. As Michael Hewson of CMC Markets put it on Radio 5 a few minutes ago, this is \"a political sideshow rather than an economic sideshow\". There's an awful lot of negative news related to the pound, and a lot of it is priced in. Breaking: The pound has slid to a new 17-month low on the currency markets this morning after the Moody's downgrade. The sterling trade-weighted index, which tracks the pound against a basket of currencies, has dropped around 1% this morning. The slide is partly because of the pound dropping around one euro cent against the euro, to \u20ac1.145. As this graph shows, the slide started once trading began in Asia overnight. The pound has actually held up quite well against the US dollar. It's broadly unchanged this morning, at $1.515 (having shed one cent late on Friday night). Good morning. Britain is tasting life outside the triple-A club after Moody's decided on Friday night to cut the national credit rating for the first time in history. The downgrade prompted fears over the weekend of a run on the pound, and speculation that UK borrowing costs could be driven higher as investors lose faith in Britain. The decision by Moody's deals a bruising blow to the embattled chancellor, George Osborne, who has repeatedly nailed his credibility to the AAA rating. Former chancellors have warned that Britain faces a difficult road, with Ken Clarke predicting it will take \"several more years\" before the AAA can be clawed back. The pound did wobble in Asian trading overnight, and is down around by one euro cent against the euro this morning. But there's no sign, yet, of a full-blown sterling crisis. We'll be tracking all the reaction to the AAA downgrade, along with other key events in the world economy. Those include the results of the Italian election, as financial markets nervously wait to see whether a clear winner emerges.",

Here's a round-up of the early comment:</p> <p><strong>Kit Juckes</strong> of <strong>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale </strong>said<strong>:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Let's start at home. Firstly, the risk of a UK default is no higher today than it was a week ago and remains incredibly low, simply because the pound can act as a shock absorber. That's the beauty of this floating currency thingy, which only becomes a problem in a real rout (think GBP/USD below parity).</p> <p>Secondly, the downgrade was so well flagged that surely it is priced in.</p> <p>And thirdly, while this does harm to the UK chancellor's credibility, the rating agencies have already trashed their credibility irredeemably.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Juckes</strong> added, though, that the pound looks \"for all the world\" as if it could drop to $1.40 against the US dollar in the longer term.</p> <p><strong>Louise Cooper</strong> of <strong>CooperCity</strong> says the downgrade proves that, without growth, the UK's debt figures look \"very nasty\":</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The UK is not a safe haven, it only became one because the rest of Europe looked so scary, the UK was relatively safe. But thanks to [the European Central Bank president Mario] Draghi, the risks of a eurozone implosion have reduced, at least for the time being. Therefore the risks of the UK, by itself, are back in the spotlight.&#xa0;</p> <p>At different times in history and the economic cycle,&#xa0;particular&#xa0;data becomes more&#xa0;or less important . I am old enough to remember the money supply-targeting of the Thatcher years. For the UK, the data to watch very closely currently is any indicator of future output/GDP and the monthly government debt figures.&#xa0;</p> <p>The UK is on a tightrope, with little in the way of a safety net. Wobbles could easily become catastrophic. Osborne: hold on tight to that balancing pole.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Gary Jenkins</strong> of <strong>Swordfish Research</strong> believes the Moody's downgrade could set the tone for the year:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>So, there we have it: officially we are now Good Britain; no longer Great, I\u2019m afraid. Oh well, it had to happen sooner or later, and it\u2019s nice that S&amp;P let Moody\u2019s go first this time. The key drivers of the downgrade were: 'continued weakness in the medium-term growth outlook, challenges that subdued growth poses to the government\u2019s fiscal consolidation programme, and, as a consequence of the UK\u2019s high and rising debt burden, a \u2018deterioration in the shock-absorption capacity of the government\u2019s balance sheet \u2026'</p> <p>Difficult to argue with that. And if the economic data across much of Europe continues to be as poor as it has over the last few months, then I think we shall see these lines repeated by the agencies in 2013.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Kathleen Brooks</strong>, research director at Forex.com, said the downgrade \"reinforces the perilous economic position the UK is in\":</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This downgrade may fuel more speculation that QE will be restarted later this year.

      "bodyText": "Sterling fell to a two-year low on Monday as currency markets signalled their waning confidence in the UK economy's ability to exit the longest depression in 80 years. The pound, which has tumbled by 8% in recent weeks, fell to $1.51 as investors digested the loss of Britain's AAA credit status and the increasingly gloomy economic outlook from independent forecasters. As recently as December it was trading at $1.63. The ratings agency Moody's, which downgraded the UK to the lower AA1, joined many analysts in predicting that the economy will be held back by a longer than expected period of low growth and bigger debt mountain. Stock markets remained calm and gilt yields, which show the government's borrowing costs, at 2.1% remained higher than Germany's 1.6%, but lower than France's 2.2%. George Osborne, deflecting criticism of his previous desire to maintain the UK's AAA status, said it was more important that gilt yields remain low, allowing the government to borrow cheaply to fund its debts. The FTSE 100 climbed on the news, largely on the back of rising commodity prices, which have increased in reaction to the improving situation in Asia and the US, and the expectation of a fresh round of quantitative easing by the Bank of England to boost growth. While some commentators welcomed the fall in sterling, arguing it would help manufacturers break into new markets with lower priced exports, there was a degree of nervousness that markets were close to losing confidence in the chancellor's economic strategy. In contrast to the eurozone, which has recovered some of its poise since the European Central Bank promised to do \"whatever it takes\" to save the currency, the pound has appeared vulnerable to attack. Jonathan Loynes, chief European economist at Capital Economics, said: \"While the downgrade may add to market nervousness about the UK's fiscal position, the key effect is simply to re-emphasise the weakness of the economic outlook.\" Loynes said he forecast just 0.2% GDP growth this year, which is well below the consensus of 0.7 to 0.8%, though he said the ability of the Bank of England to print money would cap the UK's borrowing costs by keeping gilt yields low. However, the pound could still have some way to fall. Figures released by the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission showed that betting against the pound was the most popular currency trade last week. High street bets on the pound have also gained in popularity, with Ladbrokes offering odds of 4/1 that sterling will sink to the same value as the US dollar this year. Shorter odds of 6/4 are available to punters who believe the pound will fall to parity with the euro in the same time frame. Business leaders have lobbied the chancellor to adopt a wide ranging strategy to boost the weak economy. John Longworth, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said he was concerned at the lack of lending to small businesses by high street banks. In response, he said George Osborne must accelerate plans to create an investment bank and allow it to lend directly to business customers. The bank, which is expected to increase the funds available for commercial loans, is still largely under wraps and so far earmarked only to lend to other commercial banks. \"There has been a lack of delivery,\" he said. \"The government needs to be more ambitious.\"",

      "body": "<p>On a volatile day governed by the downgrading of the UK's AAA credit rating and - perhaps more significantly - the Italian election, <strong>Royal Bank of Scotland</strong> managed to hold onto its early gains.</p> <p>The bank, which reports results on Thursday, rose 9.8p to 354.8p on talk it could use the occasion to signal a partial sale of its US bank Citizens.</p> <p>Weekend reports suggested RBS was considering a partial IPO to sell up to 25% of the American operation, which analysts value in total at between $9bn and $15bn. RBS is under pressure to continue its restructuring to make it more attractive to the UK government to sell some of its stake in the bank. Analysts at JP Morgan said:</p> <blockquote> As we have argued for over a year, Citizens offers optionality to boost capital at the cost of dilution of a strategically peripheral source of earnings (US retail) to RBS. We believe that Citizens might eventually achieve an exit valuation of 1-1.3 times net asset value based on comparison with its peer group. Although we prefer Barclays, Standard Chartered and HSBC in the UK, we see RBS shares as undervalued in a restructuring scenario and believe that the group can address regulatory capital concerns through management action. </blockquote> <p>Overall the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> finished 19.67 points higher at 6355.37, having climbed as high as 6390. The early gains came despite the Moody's downgrade of the UK, which many commentators believed was already in the price, given sterling's recent weakness. Instead investors preferred to concentrate - at least initially - on the prospect of more measures to stimulate the global economy after comments from the US Federal Reserve late on Friday, and talk that the next governor of the Bank of Japan could be Haruhiko Kuroda, an advocate of aggressive monetary easing. On top of that came a survey showing Chinese manufacturing had grown for the fourth month - albeit slipping back from recent two year highs.</p> <p>But that complacency ended abruptly amid growing signs of Silvio Berlusconi's possible return from the political dead, as evidenced by a number of polls following the Italian elections. The possibility of a centre-right win and a move away from the country's agreed austerity programme or alternatively, a hung parliament or a new election, sent shockwaves through the markets. So earlier gains were lost, and the euro came under renewed pressure. Angus Campbell, head of market analysis at Capital Spreads, said:</p> <blockquote> The threat of an unclear result in the Italian elections spooked investors in the latter part of the session as it looked like the centre-right might take the Senate, but the centre-left the Chamber, with many exit polls conflicting substantially. This uncertainty flushed out some sellers later on as memories of some of the terrible elections that took place in Greece, which inflamed the eurozone debt crisis, have come back to haunt us. <br> </blockquote> <p>Mining companies moved higher following the Chinese figures, with <strong>Antofagasta</strong> adding 33p to \u00a311.17 and <strong>Anglo American</strong> climbing 39.5p to 1981.5p.</p> <p>But <strong>Reckitt Benckiser</strong> dropped 135p to \u00a343.81 after the US regulator approved generic competition for its suboxone treatment for heroin addiction.</p> <p>Publisher <strong>Pearson</strong> lost 45p to \u00a311.71 after it said this year's earnings would be flat compared to the 2012 figure and unveiled a \u00a3150m restructuring plan.</p> <p><strong>Marks &amp; Spencer</strong> slipped 9.7p to 367.9p after weekend reports of further market share losses in clothing. Clive Black at Shore Capital said this prospect did not come as a big surprise, given the retailer's poor general merchandise sales to the end of December. He said:</p> <blockquote> We believe that there are virtues to the M&amp;S investment case, most notably a good performance from its food division, better thinking in international markets and small but interesting developments in beauty and home categories. The biggest prize to our minds though is the potential for a step up in free cash flow generation as and when infrastructure and store modernisation investment is completed within the next year or so. However, such virtues do need for general merchandise to improve in relative and absolute terms and in particular ladies wear in the UK. We cannot hide our worry lines in this respect but we remain cautiously optimistic that gradual improvement can come through. <br> Shore Capital believes that if these factors come together then M&amp;S can deliver an improvement in trading profit, sustain dividend growth (it has an attractive yield of around 5% already) and consider other shareholder friendly initiatives as free cash flow comes through such as a sustained share buy-back programme. The revelations of New Year market share do not change our views at this stage on the stock but they do remind the market of M&amp;S recent weakness in their key category. </blockquote> <p>Still with retail <strong>Associated British Foods</strong> said first half profits would be ahead of expectations, helped by continuing strength in its Primark discount fashion stores. But investors decided to bank some profits following the company's recent share price performance, pushing it 15p lower to \u00a318.15. Analyst Nick Bubb said:</p> <blockquote> The interesting aspect [to the Primark report] is that in its last update, for the 16 weeks to 5 January, sales were running up 27% overall and like for like sales growth was said to be about 9%, whereas now it is put at 7% for the full period. Other things being equal etc, assuming an even pace of new space openings, that would imply a slowdown to only 3% like for like in the last 8 weeks, but that may say more about the recently booming area of Germany than the core UK business. Interestingly, ABF say that Primark will see no further margin benefit from lower cotton prices in the second half. </blockquote> <p>Elsewhere <strong>ITV</strong> dipped 1.3p to 119.8p.

Analyst Ian Whittaker said:</p> <blockquote> While we think they could do more (our ballpark guess was \u00a3250m-\u00a3300m), they are likely to be cautious. If they returned cash, it would be around 4%-5% accretive on our numbers but 5%-6% for consensus and should drive a re-rating, especially if ITV states it sees a return of cash as an ongoing feature. ITV is our top pick in media. <br> </blockquote> <p>Property group <strong>Intu</strong>, formerly Capital Shopping Centres Group, fell 8p to 347.3p after confirming speculation it was in talks to buy Midsummer Place shopping centre in Milton Keynes from Legal &amp; General. The centre is said to be worth around \u00a3250m, and Intu said it was considering various funding options, including a possible equity issue. Analysts at Espirito Santo said:</p> <blockquote> Even in the event of a placing, we would still consider disposals to be necessary to allow the company to make meaningful commitments to its more than \u00a31bn development pipeline. We continue to believe that disposals in line with or ahead of book value will be challenging, creating the possibility that disposals are dilutive to net asset value as well as earnings per share. <br> Intu.. consistently fails to deliver total returns which exceed our assumed 8.5% cost of equity hurdle in our forecasts to 2015. Unexciting returns and our long-held concerns over capital discipline mean we remain sellers. </blockquote> <p>Housebuilder <strong>Persimmon</strong> said selling prices rose by 6% last year to \u00a3175,640 helping it record a 52% increase in profits to \u00a3225.1m. The company said it had made a strong start to the new year, with forward sales reaching \u00a31bn, up 9% on last year. Meanwhile smaller rival <strong>Bovis Homes</strong> reported a 5% rise in house prices to \u00a3170,700, with profits up 69% to \u00a354.1m.</p> <p>Persimmon shares fell 11p to 898.5p while Bovis dropped 12p to 660p.</p> <p><strong>Domino's Pizza</strong> served up record profits last year but since then its business has been hit by the wintery weather.</p> <p>The takeaway specialist said 2012 profits, including start up losses of \u00a33m from its businesses in Germany and Switzerland, rose 10.8% to \u00a346.7m, with online sales now accounting for nearly 56% of its deliveries.</p> <p>But like for like sales in the first seven weeks of the new year were up just 1.6% compared to 3.8% during the same period last year, and its shares fell 12p to 525.5p.</p>",

Analysts at Espirito Santo said: Even in the event of a placing, we would still consider disposals to be necessary to allow the company to make meaningful commitments to its more than \u00a31bn development pipeline. We continue to believe that disposals in line with or ahead of book value will be challenging, creating the possibility that disposals are dilutive to net asset value as well as earnings per share. Intu.. consistently fails to deliver total returns which exceed our assumed 8.5% cost of equity hurdle in our forecasts to 2015. Unexciting returns and our long-held concerns over capital discipline mean we remain sellers. Housebuilder Persimmon said selling prices rose by 6% last year to \u00a3175,640 helping it record a 52% increase in profits to \u00a3225.1m. The company said it had made a strong start to the new year, with forward sales reaching \u00a31bn, up 9% on last year. Meanwhile smaller rival Bovis Homes reported a 5% rise in house prices to \u00a3170,700, with profits up 69% to \u00a354.1m. Persimmon shares fell 11p to 898.5p while Bovis dropped 12p to 660p. Domino's Pizza served up record profits last year but since then its business has been hit by the wintery weather. The takeaway specialist said 2012 profits, including start up losses of \u00a33m from its businesses in Germany and Switzerland, rose 10.8% to \u00a346.7m, with online sales now accounting for nearly 56% of its deliveries. But like for like sales in the first seven weeks of the new year were up just 1.6% compared to 3.8% during the same period last year, and its shares fell 12p to 525.5p.",

RBS is under pressure to continue its restructuring to make it more attractive to the UK government to sell some of its stake in the bank. Analysts at JP Morgan said:</p> <blockquote> As we have argued for over a year, Citizens offers optionality to boost capital at the cost of dilution of a strategically peripheral source of earnings (US retail) to RBS. We believe that Citizens might eventually achieve an exit valuation of 1-1.3 times net asset value based on comparison with its peer group.

RBS is under pressure to continue its restructuring to make it more attractive to the UK government to sell some of its stake in the bank. Analysts at JP Morgan said: As we have argued for over a year, Citizens offers optionality to boost capital at the cost of dilution of a strategically peripheral source of earnings (US retail) to RBS. We believe that Citizens might eventually achieve an exit valuation of 1-1.3 times net asset value based on comparison with its peer group. Although we prefer Barclays, Standard Chartered and HSBC in the UK, we see RBS shares as undervalued in a restructuring scenario and believe that the group can address regulatory capital concerns through management action. RBS is up 11.7p at 356.7p while Barclays is 8.2p better at 315.2p. Elsewhere ITV has dipped 1p to 120.1p. The broadcaster, which has recently been lifted by bid speculation, also reports figures this week and Liberum Capital repeated its buy recommendation following talk of a possible \u00a3200m cash return to shareholders. Analyst Ian Whittaker said: While we think they could do more (our ballpark guess was \u00a3250m-\u00a3300m), they are likely to be cautious. If they returned cash, it would be around 4%-5% accretive on our numbers but 5%-6% for consensus and should drive a re-rating, especially if ITV states it sees a return of cash as an ongoing feature. ITV is our top pick in media.",
