Inflation has outpaced wage growth for the majority of the period since 2008, piling on financial pressure for UK households.

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s volunteer army will be out in force on Thursday, providing a Christmas dinner for the hungry, shelter for the homeless and a shoulder to cry on for the old and lonely. David Cameron calls this the \u2018big society\u2019 in action. His opponents say the reality is a cash-strapped charitable sector struggling to cope with a bigger caseload thanks to the government\u2019s spending cuts. As a concept, the big society is a good thing. Nobody could really object to the idea that people should be encouraged to help others. Those who will be running soup kitchens and hostels on Christmas Day deserve nothing but praise. There are sound economic reasons why the government should be encouraging people to volunteer. But they are not the ones normally used by Cameron and his ministers. The thinking behind the big society is the same as the thinking behind the government\u2019s economic strategy: the state got too big and \u201ccrowded out\u201d the private sector. In the case of the economy, George Osborne believes that running a tight ship will lead to lower interest rates and so encourage the private sector to invest. In the case of the big society, the notion is that people have become so accustomed to the state intruding into areas that were once the preserve of the voluntary sector that they have become more selfish and so lost the instinct to help others. Scaling back the state will therefore \u201ccrowd in\u201d private welfare provision. The \u201ccrowding out\u201d argument didn\u2019t work for the economy. Interest rates were already low when Osborne became chancellor so cutting public spending and raising taxes had the effect of reducing demand. Lower demand made businesses more cautious about investing, and it has only been since the government boosted growth by re-invigorating the housing market that firms have been willing to spend more. The idea that spending cuts will crowd in the big society is similarly flawed. Firstly, there is no record of this approach working in the past. According to research by Arthur Downing of Oxford University, periods of state cutbacks in the nineteenth century did not lead to a flourishing of community organisations. Austerity inhibited rather than encouraged the growth of self-help friendly societies. Secondly, there is not an easy divide between the state and voluntarism. The charitable sector relies heavily on financial support from the government and has seen its funding pared back. It is hard to find a charity now that says it is not struggling to make ends meet. The cash crisis is particularly acute for those organisations that depend on local authority grants, the sector of state spending that has been most aggressively cut. Finally, there is no real evidence that the willingness to volunteer has changed much over the years. If Cameron\u2019s argument is that New Labour\u2019s nanny state created a nation of self-centred couch potatoes, then that is not supported by the evidence. The percentage of the population volunteering once a month stood at just above 25% in 2001, rose a bit during the boom and then fell back to its original level when the financial crisis broke in 2007-08. Volunteering is currently at a 10-year-high, but according to Andy Haldane, the chief economist at the Bank of England, it tends to go up and down (but only a bit) with the economic cycle. There are reasons to think the willingness to volunteer will rise; there is a greater tendency to volunteer among older people and their numbers will rise as the population ages. There also appears to have been a behaviour shift among young people, where participation rates have doubled in the past decade. Haldane\u2019s real point in a recent lecture, though, was to attempt to put a monetary value on volunteering in order to show just how much the willingness to do unpaid work benefits Britain. Around 15 million people volunteer regularly. They put in between them over 2bn hours a year, or on average just over an hour a week for every person over the age of 16. This is just formal volunteering, unpaid work for groups, clubs, charities or other organisations. It is estimated that the same amount of time is spent on informal volunteering, which might be running a neighbour to a doctor\u2019s appointment or taking an elderly relative to do their shopping. Haldane says the economic value of volunteering could exceed \u00a350bn a year \u2013 which would make it as big as the energy sector. But that\u2019s not the end of the measurable benefits. Individuals get a private benefit from doing things for others. They enjoy volunteering: it gives them satisfaction; it broadens their circle of friends; it boosts their confidence; reduces stress; makes them healthier; and teaches them new skills. Haldane says that the gains to the individual in terms of wellbeing, improved health and increased employability might exceed the \u00a350bn-plus benefit to the recipients of volunteering. In addition, there\u2019s the social value of volunteering. Haldane provides the example of economists who worked with the charity Centrepoint to work out the value to society of reducing homelessness, through putting young people into work or training; by preventing them re-offending; by reducing the incidence of mental health issues; and dealing with substance abuse. For every \u00a31 invested, there was a social benefit of \u00a32.40. Haldane puts it this way: \u201cWe have a volunteer army, the full-time equivalent of 1.25 million people, diverse in age, gender, background and ethnicity and potentially growing in number. They create each year economic value of at least \u00a350bn and potentially higher. They create private value for individual volunteers of maybe as much again. And although the confidence intervals are large, it would not be unreasonable to apply a social multiplier of upwards of two to these estimates.\u201d The conclusion from all this is pretty simple. Individuals should be encouraged to volunteer because they could well be unaware of the personal benefits they will get from doing so. Businesses should be encouraged to provide the time for their staff to volunteer because they will end up with a more skilled, productive and better-motivated workforce as a result. He notes that while 70 of the firms in the FTSE 100 have employer supported volunteering schemes, that still means 30 do not. What\u2019s more, there is only one director drawn from the voluntary sector for FTSE 100 companies. Governments should be encouraged to promote volunteering because it improves wellbeing, meets a demand for services and makes people more contented. Cameron can rightly say that he is trying to flesh out the big society concept. One example is that since 2011, the civil service has been formally encouraging staff to spend one day a year volunteering. But let\u2019s be clear. There is no binary choice here. A smaller state does not equal a bigger society.",

      "bodyText": "Vladimir Putin had his Jim Callaghan moment last week. Faced with questions about the state of the economy in the wake of the rouble\u2019s freefall on the foreign exchanges, the Russian president said the problems would be overcome in two years. Echoing Callaghan\u2019s words on his arrival back to the UK from a summit in Guadeloupe during the winter of discontent, Putin said it was not even fair to say Russia was in crisis. Given some of the previous setbacks Russia has overcome, that may well be true. It is not like 1941, when the country\u2019s very existence was in doubt. It is not like Stalin\u2019s manmade famine in the Ukraine in 1932-3. But by the standards of the modern world, Russia is facing a crisis. Even before last week\u2019s turbulence on the foreign exchanges, the central bank was expecting the economy to contract by 4.5% next year. A deep recession is unavoidable. Putin\u2019s optimism about the economy is based on the assumption that the global price of oil will rise as cheaper energy prices spur consumer spending and investment across the world. He\u2019s almost certainly right about that. Booms are nearly always associated with low oil prices, so there is a good chance that global GDP will be higher than expected next year. That will lead to higher demand for oil, which will push up the price. Some analysts think the recent fall in the cost of crude has been overdone and that the price will recover to about $80 a barrel next year. In the short term, this would be good for Russia, given its dependence on the energy sector. In the long term, though, it would be better for Russia if the oil price stayed low: that would force the country to tackle some of the economic challenges it has ducked for the past couple of decades. Here\u2019s the problem. Russia is a resource-rich country. It has abundant oil and gas reserves. It has big mineral reserves and large forests. What Russia doesn\u2019t have is a modern manufacturing sector. Its industrial base is old and uses clapped-out equipment. It has failed to invest in either physical or human capital. So 80% of its exports are in oil, natural gas, metals, timber and defence equipment. The make-up of the economy has changed little since Russia\u2019s last brush with the financial markets, in 1998. What happened then was that so much capital was leaving Russia that the country had to run a big surplus on its current account \u2013 exporting more than it imported \u2013 in order to keep the balance of payments stable. A low oil price made this impossible, and a rising balance of payments deficit led to a run on the rouble. Bringing the balance of payments back into line required a dose of heavy domestic austerity designed to restrict imports. That should have been a lesson to Moscow\u2019s policymakers. But they did nothing, and from 2003 onwards rising oil prices papered over the cracks. With the cost of crude above $100 a barrel, Russia could run both a budget and a current account surplus. It didn\u2019t seem to matter that the economy was becoming ever more narrowly focused on the energy sector. But now that the oil price has fallen \u2013 from $115 a barrel in the summer to around $60 a barrel on Friday \u2013 the old problems have come back. A smaller current account surplus is not big enough to cover losses on the capital account, which are estimated to be around $125bn this year. That\u2019s why the rouble has come under pressure and why, in the absence of a sustained effort to rebalance and modernise the manufacturing sector and invest in new machinery and skills, it will keep on coming under pressure every time there is a sustained fall in the cost of crude. Stressful times for the Co-op Let\u2019s be frank. House prices have never fallen as far as 35% during a recession, so when the Bank of England said last week that its stress-test scenario had gauged how well lenders could cope with a serous shock, it had a point. Of the eight lenders tested, those with relatively large mortgage books \u2013 Nationwide, Royal Bank of Scotland, Lloyds Banking Group and Co-operative Bank \u2013 would be particularly exposed if such a calamity were to take place. The embattled Co-op Bank had trailed its failure in advance, but the scale of it was spectacular. As the Bank of England put it, Co-op Bank\u2019s capital would be exhausted. In simple terms, the bank would be wiped out. But RBS and Lloyds \u2013 already backed by the taxpayer \u2013 would also take a hit, and policymakers made it clear that the two banks needed to stock up on capital to be safe. That is all well and good, but on the day the Bank of England was releasing the results, the financial market\u2019s anxiety about house-price bubbles had abated, to be replaced by fears that a full-blown currency crisis is under way in Russia. So it is right that next year\u2019s test will focus on risks in emerging markets \u2013 then Standard Chartered and HSBC might find themselves in the spotlight. But it is a shame that the Bank of England stepped back from extending its stress tests further across the financial system, to foreign banks with big presences in the City that could be exposed to market turbulence. It should return to this idea in the future. In the meantime the focus is on the Co-op Bank, which is being shrunk to fit its capital and expects to remain loss-making until at least the end of 2016. Not so long ago, the Co-op was being positioned as a major challenger bank to the big four of RBS, Lloyds, Barclays and HSBC. The chances of that now look pretty slim. The stress-tests results provided yet another reminder of the corporate governance disaster that unfolded at the bank and its former parent, Co-operative Group. Did you hear the one about the two Irishmen in an airline office? The prodigal son of Aer Lingus may return. And this time, he could be buying up the homestead. Willie Walsh, boss of IAG, the group formed to wed British Airways to Iberia and any more European airlines it fancied, has turned his sights on the Irish airline at which he first entered the business. Back in 1979, he was a starry-eyed pilot. By 2001, having briefly flown the nest to run a Spanish charter business, he was the chief executive earning a reputation as a brutal pruner of jobs. \u201cSlasher\u201d Walsh did the same at BA, then at Iberia. Aer Lingus staff can probably rest easier. The business is already lean and profitable: its biggest single shareholder is Ryanair. An IAG takeover would see Walsh playing hardball with Ryanair boss Michael O\u2019Leary. It would be some battle. Two famously rich and proudly tight Irishmen. Who will prove the meanest?",

That will lead to higher demand for oil, which will push up the price. Some analysts think the recent fall in the cost of crude has been overdone and that the price will recover to about $80 a barrel next year.</p> <p>In the short term, this would be good for Russia, given its dependence on the energy sector. In the long term, though, it would be better for Russia if the oil price stayed low: that would force the country to tackle some of the economic challenges it has ducked for the past couple of decades.</p> <p>Here\u2019s the problem. Russia is a resource-rich country. It has abundant oil and gas reserves. It has big mineral reserves and large forests. What Russia doesn\u2019t have is a modern manufacturing sector. Its industrial base is old and uses clapped-out equipment. It has failed to invest in either physical or human capital. So 80% of its exports are in oil, natural gas, metals, timber and defence equipment.</p> <p>The make-up of the economy has changed little since Russia\u2019s last brush with the financial markets, in 1998. What happened then was that so much capital was leaving Russia that the country had to run a big surplus on its current account \u2013 exporting more than it imported \u2013 in order to keep the balance of payments stable. A low oil price made this impossible, and a rising balance of payments deficit led to a run on the rouble. Bringing the balance of payments back into line required a dose of heavy domestic austerity designed to restrict imports.</p> <p>That should have been a lesson to Moscow\u2019s policymakers. But they did nothing, and from 2003 onwards rising oil prices papered over the cracks. With the cost of crude above $100 a barrel, Russia could run both a budget and a current account surplus. It didn\u2019t seem to matter that the economy was becoming ever more narrowly focused on the energy sector.</p> <p>But now that the oil price has fallen \u2013 from $115 a barrel in the summer to around $60 a barrel on Friday \u2013 the old problems have come back. A smaller current account surplus is not big enough to cover losses on the capital account, which are estimated to be around $125bn this year.</p> <p>That\u2019s why the rouble has come under pressure and why, in the absence of a sustained effort to rebalance and modernise the manufacturing sector and invest in new machinery and skills, it will keep on coming under pressure every time there is a sustained fall in the cost of crude.</p> <h2>Stressful times for the Co-op<br></h2> <p>Let\u2019s be frank. House prices have never fallen as far as 35% during a recession, so when the Bank of England said last week that its stress-test scenario had gauged how well lenders could cope with a serous shock, it had a point. Of the eight lenders tested, those with relatively large mortgage books \u2013 Nationwide, Royal Bank of Scotland, Lloyds Banking Group and Co-operative Bank \u2013 would be particularly exposed if such a calamity were to take place.</p> <p>The embattled Co-op Bank had trailed its failure in advance, but the scale of it was spectacular. As the Bank of England put it, Co-op Bank\u2019s capital would be exhausted. In simple terms, the bank would be wiped out. But RBS and Lloyds \u2013 already backed by the taxpayer \u2013 would also take a hit, and policymakers made it clear that the two banks needed to stock up on capital to be safe.</p> <p>That is all well and good, but on the day the Bank of England was releasing the results, the financial market\u2019s anxiety about house-price bubbles had abated, to be replaced by fears that a full-blown currency crisis is under way in Russia.</p> <p>So it is right that next year\u2019s test will focus on risks in emerging markets \u2013 then Standard Chartered and HSBC might find themselves in the spotlight. But it is a shame that the Bank of England stepped back from extending its stress tests further across the financial system, to foreign banks with big presences in the City that could be exposed to market turbulence. It should return to this idea in the future.</p> <p>In the meantime the focus is on the Co-op Bank, which is being shrunk to fit its capital and expects to remain loss-making until at least the end of 2016. Not so long ago, the Co-op was being positioned as a major challenger bank to the big four of RBS, Lloyds, Barclays and HSBC. The chances of that now look pretty slim. The stress-tests results provided yet another reminder of the corporate governance disaster that unfolded at the bank and its former parent, Co-operative Group.</p> <h2>Did you hear the one about the two Irishmen in an airline office?<br></h2> <p>The prodigal son of Aer Lingus may return. And this time, he could be buying up the homestead. Willie Walsh, boss of IAG, the group formed to wed British Airways to Iberia and any more European airlines it fancied, has turned his sights on the Irish airline at which he first entered the business. Back in 1979, he was a starry-eyed pilot. By 2001, having briefly flown the nest to run a Spanish charter business, he was the chief executive earning a reputation as a brutal pruner of jobs. \u201cSlasher\u201d Walsh did the same at BA, then at Iberia.</p> <p>Aer Lingus staff can probably rest easier. The business is already lean and profitable: its biggest single shareholder is Ryanair. An IAG takeover would see Walsh playing hardball with Ryanair boss Michael O\u2019Leary. It would be some battle. Two famously rich and proudly tight Irishmen. Who will prove the meanest?</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "At weddings and formal events in the Philippines, men can often be seen wearing the Barong Tagalog, a thin and transparent embroidered garment worn over a shirt. One of the more surprising materials used in its manufacture are fibres from pineapple leaves \u2013 and long strands of the leaves could soon also be used to make a host of other products, from trainers and clothes to bags and car upholstery. Called Pi\u00f1atex - pi\u00f1a is Spanish for pineapple - the new material was created by Carmen Hijosa, who worked as a consultant in the Philippines leather goods industry in the 1990s. She was unimpressed with the standard of goods produced and started to look for alternatives. It was the strength and the fineness of the pineapple leaf fibres used in the Barong Tagalog that first alerted her that there was another option: \u201cI was looking for an alternative to leather. That was the beginning of my thinking. \u2018What is going to be in these beautiful bags that is not leather?\u2019,\u201d the Spanish designer said. The breakthrough came when Hijosa realised that she could make a non-woven mesh \u2013 a fabric which is bonded together without knitting or weaving \u2013 from the long fibres, in a similar way to felt. The fibres that make up Pi\u00f1atex are extracted from pineapple leaves on plantations by farmers before they are cut up and layered. They are then put through an industrial process at the end of which emerges the textile. A byproduct of the process is a biomass which can be converted into fertiliser, giving additional income to the farmers. With a similar appearance to canvas, it can be dyed, printed, and treated to give different types of texture. With treatment, the Pi\u00f1atex can closely resemble leather while separate thicknesses are also produced, depending on the use of the finished product. For more heavy wearing items, such as bags, a thicker material will be required. Leather prices have been pushed up because there are fewer animals from which to make it, says Hijosa. \u201cLeather is becoming a luxury, placing itself in the higher price point of the market.\u201d she said. \u201cThere is a gap in the market between petroleum-based textiles and leather, which is the middle price point, and that is the gap that Pi\u00f1atex the product is really seeking. \u201cWe can make shoes, we can make bags. We can make chairs, sofas. It can be panelling. Eventually it can be made into the interiors of cars, even linings.\u201d Hijosa has spent the last five years developing Pi\u00f1atex in the Royal College of Art and sample shoes have been made by Camper and Puma. Designer Ally Capellino has also made bags from it. While Hijosa wanted to create a product that could act as an alternative to leather, she also wanted it to be environmentally friendly. As it is a byproduct of the pineapple, Pi\u00f1atex is not using additional land to be produced, she said. \u201cWe are completely new. We are not replacing, we are an alternative. We are an alternative to leather and an alternative to petroleum-based textiles which is sustainable and has a strong sociological and ecological background,\u201d she said. The cost of Pi\u00f1atex, which was launched in London earlier this month, is currently about \u00a318 per square metre (a piece of furniture would require about five square metres) while leather is between \u00a320 and \u00a330, according to the designer. \u201cWe have the advantage that our waste is about 5% whereas leather\u2019s waste is about 25% so there is a price to pay for waste as well,\u201d she said. So far, industry players have been eager to experiment with the new textile as they search for fresh ideas, although Hijosa concedes it will take some time to develop in the market. She believes consumers will be interested in buying a sustainable product which helps farming communities on the other side of the world. \u201cThere are more and more brands looking for new and sustainable textiles, which is really the market position where we are placing ourselves. It is difficult, it has to perform, and will take time because now they are making the first prototypes, you may or may not buy it. It is neither the cool Converse nor is it a leather product so the market has to warm to it,\u201d she said. But she believes the market is quite open to new products that are well-priced: \u201cIt is a little bit like when formica came into being. First of all it was a substitute for something \u2013 wood \u2013 and it looked ugly to our eyes. But eventually it became a product by itself with its own look and feel and I think Pi\u00f1atex will do the same thing. When she first started looking for an alternative to leather, Hijosa wanted the new product to look like the one it was replacing. Now, however, she says: \u201cI am not really happy if it looks like leather because it has to start looking [like] itself.\u201d The projections are that 1m square metres of the Pi\u00f1atex will be be sold every year by 2018, which Hijosa believes is \u201cquite feasible\u201d. Talks are underway to secure more funding for the company behind the product, of which she is the majority owner. Future plans will see research into further possible uses for Pi\u00f1atex. These might include anti-bacterial wound coverings, as the material would allow air to circulate to an injury, and also insulation for homes. 16 pineapples, 480 leaves, 14 months The average pineapple plant has between 30 and 40 leaves around it, each about one metre in length. In order to produce one square metre of medium weight Pi\u00f1atex, 480 leaves are needed \u2013 or the byproduct of 16 pineapples, of which there is a crop every 14 months in countries such as Brazil, Thailand, the Philippines, China, Kenya and Ghana. Usually the leaves are left to rot in the ground after the pineapples are harvested, said Hijosa",

That was the beginning of my thinking. \u2018What is going to be in these beautiful bags that is not leather?\u2019,\u201d the Spanish designer said.</p> <p>The breakthrough came when Hijosa realised that she could make a non-woven mesh \u2013 a fabric which is bonded together without knitting or weaving \u2013 from the long fibres, in a similar way to felt.</p> <p>The fibres that make up Pi\u00f1atex are extracted from pineapple leaves on plantations by farmers before they are cut up and layered. They are then put through an industrial process at the end of which emerges the textile. A byproduct of the process is a biomass which can be converted into fertiliser, giving additional income to the farmers.</p> <p>With a similar appearance to canvas, it can be dyed, printed, and treated to give different types of texture. With treatment, the Pi\u00f1atex can closely resemble leather while separate thicknesses are also produced, depending on the use of the finished product. For more heavy wearing items, such as bags, a thicker material will be required.</p> <p>Leather prices have been pushed up because there are fewer animals from which to make it, says Hijosa. \u201cLeather is becoming a luxury, placing itself in the higher price point of the market.\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cThere is a gap in the market between petroleum-based textiles and leather, which is the middle price point, and that is the gap that Pi\u00f1atex the product is really seeking.</p> <p>\u201cWe can make shoes, we can make bags. We can make chairs, sofas. It can be panelling. Eventually it can be made into the interiors of cars, even linings.\u201d</p> <p>Hijosa has spent the last five years developing Pi\u00f1atex in the Royal College of Art and sample shoes have been made by Camper and Puma. Designer Ally Capellino has also made bags from it.</p> <p>While Hijosa wanted to create a product that could act as an alternative to leather, she also wanted it to be environmentally friendly. As it is a byproduct of the pineapple, Pi\u00f1atex is not using additional land to be produced, she said.</p> <p>\u201cWe are completely new. We are not replacing, we are an alternative. We are an alternative to leather and an alternative to petroleum-based textiles which is sustainable and has a strong sociological and ecological background,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The cost of Pi\u00f1atex, which was launched in London earlier this month, is currently about \u00a318 per square metre (a piece of furniture would require about five square metres) while leather is between \u00a320 and \u00a330, according to the designer. \u201cWe have the advantage that our waste is about 5% whereas leather\u2019s waste is about 25% so there is a price to pay for waste as well,\u201d she said.</p> <p>So far, industry players have been eager to experiment with the new textile as they search for fresh ideas, although Hijosa concedes it will take some time to develop in the market. She believes consumers will be interested in buying a sustainable product which helps farming communities on the other side of the world.</p> <p>\u201cThere are more and more brands looking for new and sustainable textiles, which is really the market position where we are placing ourselves. It is difficult, it has to perform, and will take time because now they are making the first prototypes, you may or may not buy it. It is neither the cool Converse nor is it a leather product so the market has to warm to it,\u201d she said.</p> <p>But she believes the market is quite open to new products that are well-priced: \u201cIt is a little bit like when formica came into being. First of all it was a substitute for something \u2013 wood \u2013 and it looked ugly to our eyes. But eventually it became a product by itself with its own look and feel and I think Pi\u00f1atex will do the same thing.</p> <p>When she first started looking for an alternative to leather, Hijosa wanted the new product to look like the one it was replacing. Now, however, she says: \u201cI am not really happy if it looks like leather because it has to start looking [like] itself.\u201d</p> <p>The projections are that 1m square metres of the Pi\u00f1atex will be be sold every year by 2018, which Hijosa believes is \u201cquite feasible\u201d. Talks are underway to secure more funding for the company behind the product, of which she is the majority owner.</p> <p>Future plans will see research into further possible uses for Pi\u00f1atex. These might include anti-bacterial wound coverings, as the material would allow air to circulate to an injury, and also insulation for homes.</p> <h2>16 pineapples, 480 leaves, 14 months</h2> <p>The average pineapple plant has between 30 and 40 leaves around it, each about one metre in length. In order to produce one square metre of medium weight Pi\u00f1atex, 480 leaves are needed \u2013 or the byproduct of 16 pineapples, of which there is a crop every 14 months in countries such as Brazil, Thailand, the Philippines, China, Kenya and Ghana. Usually the leaves are left to rot in the ground after the pineapples are harvested, said Hijosa</p>",

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s tough on the high street as fashion chains struggle to offload winter woollies and coats after the warm autumn, but business has never been brisker in the market for specially tailored clothes for our canine friends. \u00a3170-a-go designer jackets, Christmas jumpers, hi-tech waterproofs, tracksuits and hoodies for pampered hounds have been flying off the shelves. When Marks &amp; Spencer joins Barbour, John Lewis, Asda and even teen brand American Apparel in providing clothing for dogs, it\u2019s clear that a trend has emerged. Pets Corner, the UK\u2019s second largest pet store chain, says sales of dog coats are up 35% this year compared with 2013, as pet owners have moved on from simply wanting something to keep their dog dry to searching out more stylish kit. Pets at Home, the UK\u2019s biggest pet store chain, says so far this winter it has sold 17% more than in 2013 \u2013 or some 105,000 items of pet clothing. \u201cAll you have to do is take a walk in the park in the middle of the day to see that more and more dogs are wearing coats or jackets,\u201d says David Robinson of the Kennel Club. \u201cIt\u2019s become more acceptable. Dogs have become part of the family, so people want to buy them toys, accessories and clothing.\u201d Marks &amp; Spencer started selling dog coats in October, while John Lewis says sales of pets\u2019 clothing and accessories are up 94% on last year, when it first opened a pet department. Barbour \u2013 purveyor of status waxed and quilted jackets for country pursuits and City commuters \u2013 says it has doubled sales of canine coats in the past three years. It sells a range of six styles, in dachshund to great Dane sizes, to match those worn by their owners. While they are catering for those wanting to keep their pets stylishly warm and dry, novelty outfits are also in demand, especially for Christmas. Asda says it has sold 2,500 Christmas dog jumpers so far this year \u2013 including a red knit patterned with Christmas pudding motifs, holly, and the words Ho Ho Ho \u2013 and a whopping 5,500 novelty pet outfits for those who prefer to dress up their pets in Santa costumes or as green-suited elves. In a tough economic environment, where shoppers are being choosy about how they spend their disposable cash, retailers and brands are keen to jump into a relatively high growth market. A survey conducted by the RSPCA last year found that more than nine in 10 UK pet owners planned to buy their dog a gift last Christmas, with half ready to spend more than \u00a310 on the family pooch\u2019s festive treat. Analysts at Euromonitor say the amount spent on pet foods and care products is 4% higher than a year ago and they predict growth will continue at that pace for the next five years. With an eye on that opportunity, internet grocer Ocado has opened a separate online pet store, called Fetch, while the discounter Poundstretcher is trying out a Pet Hut chain to sell bargain pet care products. Sarah Bourne of Pets Corner says: \u201cPeople are a lot more precious about their pets.\u201d Customers who buy special shampoo, \u00a390 sacks of dog food and treats made from venison or dried salmon \u201cwant their pet to be snuggly. Or pretty. Or both.\u201d She reckons the trend in the UK was kicked off by celebrities like Paris Hilton and Lady Gaga, who both dress up their pet dogs like dolls, but says the majority of Brits want more practical outfits. As a result Pets Corner has responded with new ranges of far more technical kit with Teflon-coated, weather resistant, anti-microbial, thermal polyfill and breathable fabrics. \u201cPeople are used to buying North Face and want the same for their dogs,\u201d Bourne says.",

      "bodyText": "John Paul Getty\u2019s formula for success was to rise early, work hard and strike oil. But a dependence on the black stuff can create its own problems, especially when the price tumbles as it has over the last few months. The price of a barrel of Brent crude has almost halved from $115 in the summer to stabilise around $60 last week. Most forecasters expect the cost of oil to remain low well into next year. Getty became a billionaire oil magnate after four years of speculative drilling in the Saudi Arabian desert proved to be worth the risk. Now the house of Saud appears willing to wait almost as long for its own victory. The plan, agreed with Opec, maintains output, ignoring demands for cuts to push the price back up again. As the dominant Opec member, and keen to protect its own market share, the Saudis have forced the others to take the long view with a strategy that aims to put out of business all those producers that have flooded the market in the last few years and dragged the price lower. US fracking firms, where production costs are high, should be the first to feel the financial pain. But there will be collateral damage to others too. Iran may find itself running out of cash. And then there is Russia, which is heading for a deep recession next year as gas prices follow oil to lows not seen in 10 years. There will be winners too. The UK, now a net importer of oil, has already benefited by an estimated \u00a33m-a-day reduction in fuel costs. Businesses will gain from cheaper energy, and cheaper petrol in effect puts more cash in consumers\u2019 pockets. Taken in the round, global GDP could rise by 0.2% to 0.5% as the wheels of trade are lubricated a little more. 1. The US There is a popular theory that the US wants to see oil prices low for some time to undermine Vladimir Putin\u2019s ambitions in eastern Europe, put pressure on Iran and spur a global economy desperately in need of cheap energy. In the US alone, each $10-per-barrel drop in the price of oil boosts GDP by 0.1%, according to Swiss investment bank UBS. Fracked oil and gas across the central plains of the Dakotas, Kansas and Nebraska, coupled with oil from Canadian tar sands, has slashed demand for oil imports to the US \u2013 resulting in the world market for oil and gas being flooded. Alongside rising supply is waning demand, especially as Japan looks to switch back on its nuclear power stations and China\u2019s manufacturing sector growth slows. Yet a prolonged period of low prices could put the entire fracking industry out of business. Frackers have a break even point of $110 a barrel or above and have few resources to maintain uneconomic production. Frackers have pushed output from 5m barrels a day in 2008 to 8.5m in June this year. Gas production is up by a third since 2005. One US academic estimated that one shale find in south Texas added $87bn to the US economy in 2013. The closure of one well after another, which is already happening, is not therefore something the White House can ignore. 2. Venezuela Only a couple months ago, a standard Barbie doll sold for about $200 in Venezuelan shops. In the runup to Christmas she can be bought for as little as $2.50, while stocks still last, following President Nicolas Maduro\u2019s bizarre effort at subsidising festive consumerism. Worse, the cash used to buy Barbies will soak up much of the country\u2019s foreign currency, already depleted after years of corrupt import scams and now the falling oil price. One of the worst-hit members of Opec, Venezuela has a oil price beak-even point of $117 a barrel. Such is the inefficiency of its industry and the profligacy of its government that some industry experts expect it to run out of money next year. Instead of Father Christmas, Maduro may then have to turn into the Grinch, imposing even greater levels of austerity on an already beleaguered nation. 3. UK In 2005 the UK became a net importer of oil, complicating its relationship with a source of bumper revenues over the previous 25 years. The recent fall in the oil price helps the balance of payments and gives a price cut to consumers worth \u00a33m a day, but it hits an industry that keeps much of Scotland\u2019s west coast in employment and provides the exchequer with significant if declining tax revenues. The boss of Wood Group, an oil engineering firm, said 15,000 jobs could go next year as output drops to 800,000 barrels a day. Nicola Sturgeon, Scottish National party leader, is likely to be recalibrating her stance on North Sea oil as a secure base for the finances of an independent Scotland (her predecessor, Alex Salmond, based his economic rationale for independence prior to the September referendum on oil at $113). Such is the power of fluctuating oil prices to influence economic decision-making that it was mentioned last week as not only putting extra pounds in shoppers pockets for Christmas spending, but also depressing the inflation rate to the extent that Bank of England officials must delay interest rate rises scheduled for next summer. 4. Russia President Vladimir Putin dismissed concerns at his annual press conference last week that Russia could default on its debts should oil prices remain low next year. But he was kidding few that Russia can prosper with prices at $60. Russia\u2019s parliament recently approved a three-year budget that assumed an oil price of $100 a barrel in 2015-17. The finance ministry now expects oil to trade at $80 next year, and the economy to contract by 0.8%. Budget revisions are ruled out. Nevertheless, with oil and gas accounting for 70% of exports and 50% of tax receipts, anything less than $100 a barrel will mean big budget cuts and far deeper recession. It looks as if infrastructure spending will be sacrificed to protect welfare and defence budgets \u2013 with the incursion into Ukraine aiding the armed forces\u2019 demand for a 30% budget boost. Russian companies that borrowed from western banks are also in trouble. The corporate sector tapped the west for cheap credit and must pay the interest on the loans in dollars at a time when a collapse in the rouble means dollars are more expensive. Oligarchs have lobbied Putin to help pay their loans. So far the president has said no, preferring to rely on the central bank defending the rouble by pushing interest rates to 17%. 5. Iran As one of the targets for both Saudi and US foreign policy, Tehran is in a bind. The government has increased spending to placate its westernised middle class at the very moment US sanctions and the low oil price are both eating into its budget. The US hopes that a deal is possible limiting Iran\u2019s nuclear ambitions while the Saudis want an end to Iranian-funded jihadis in the region. The first is possible and the second unlikely, but cash-for-terrorism could be more circumscribed following a prolonged period of low oil prices. 6. Saudi Arabia The desert state has amassed a $1trn war chest to see it through periods of lower prices. Only last week a clearly relaxed finance minister Ibrahim Alassaf said his 2015 budget would go ahead despite \u201cchallenging\u201d global economic conditions. Alassaf has championed the kingdom\u2019s \u201ccounter-cyclical\u201d fiscal policy, which helped build up a mountain of foreign assets when oil prices were high. So while the world\u2019s top oil exporter is believed to need an average crude price above $90 a barrel to balance its budget, and a first budget deficit since 2009 will involve the sale of foreign assets to balance the books, it can survive for many years at $60 a barrel. And why would it do this? To limit the global production of oil and gas over the longer term, especially fracked oil and gas in the US and Europe, which have previously depended on Middle Eastern supplies. And, like the US, it wants to bring Iran to heel.",

Frackers have a break even point of $110 a barrel or above and have few resources to maintain uneconomic production.</p> <p>Frackers have pushed output from 5m barrels a day in 2008 to 8.5m in June this year. Gas production is up by a third since 2005. One US academic estimated that one shale find in south Texas added $87bn to the US economy in 2013. The closure of one well after another, which is already happening, is not therefore something the White House can ignore.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c333cf4ba70dc15b587737675741253d27ab3897\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/20/1419097659500/59893313-ac47-4159-a028-0287b7182f8a-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Shoppers look at Barbie dolls for sale in Caracas.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shoppers look at Barbie dolls for sale in Caracas.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ariana Cubillos/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>2. Venezuela</h2> <p>Only a couple months ago, a standard Barbie doll sold for about $200 in Venezuelan shops. In the runup to Christmas she can be bought for as little as $2.50, while stocks still last, following President Nicolas Maduro\u2019s bizarre effort at subsidising festive consumerism.</p> <p>Worse, the cash used to buy Barbies will soak up much of the country\u2019s foreign currency, already depleted after years of corrupt import scams and now the falling oil price.</p> <p>One of the worst-hit members of Opec, Venezuela has a oil price beak-even point of $117 a barrel. Such is the inefficiency of its industry and the profligacy of its government that some industry experts expect it to run out of money next year. Instead of Father Christmas, Maduro may then have to turn into the Grinch, imposing even greater levels of austerity on an already beleaguered nation.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"40657c092623558b55f54be44f610fe1ed4e6c83\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/20/1419097934411/1bf6d904-54d4-4c5d-9a73-6de1ef899b56-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"A BP rig in the Eastern Trough Area project, about 100 miles east of Aberdeen, Scotland.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A BP rig in the Eastern Trough Area project, about 100 miles east of Aberdeen, Scotland.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>3. UK</h2> <p>In 2005 the UK became a net importer of oil, complicating its relationship with a source of bumper revenues over the previous 25 years. The recent fall in the oil price helps the balance of payments and gives a price cut to consumers worth \u00a33m a day, but it hits an industry that keeps much of Scotland\u2019s west coast in employment and provides the exchequer with significant if declining tax revenues. The boss of Wood Group, an oil engineering firm, said 15,000 jobs could go next year as output drops to 800,000 barrels a day. Nicola Sturgeon, Scottish National party leader, is likely to be recalibrating her stance on North Sea oil as a secure base for the finances of an independent Scotland (her predecessor, Alex Salmond, based his economic rationale for independence prior to the September referendum on oil at $113).</p> <p>Such is the power of fluctuating oil prices to influence economic decision-making that it was mentioned last week as not only putting extra pounds in shoppers pockets for Christmas spending, but also depressing the inflation rate to the extent that Bank of England officials must delay interest rate rises scheduled for next summer.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8a35ada61b094c6cb4c5db31d4ca53c4772fef2c\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/20/1419097829694/e9f18960-9670-44e1-887e-cb06b83c4275-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Nefteyugansk, the main town of the Yuganskneftegaz oil company, in central Russia.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nefteyugansk, the main town of the Yuganskneftegaz oil company, in central Russia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yuri Kotchetkov/Yuri Kotchetkov/epa/Corbis</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>4. Russia</h2> <p>President Vladimir Putin dismissed concerns at his annual press conference last week that Russia could default on its debts should oil prices remain low next year. But he was kidding few that Russia can prosper with prices at $60. Russia\u2019s parliament recently approved a three-year budget that assumed an oil price of $100 a barrel in 2015-17.</p> <p>The finance ministry now expects oil to trade at $80 next year, and the economy to contract by 0.8%. Budget revisions are ruled out. Nevertheless, with oil and gas accounting for 70% of exports and 50% of tax receipts, anything less than $100 a barrel will mean big budget cuts and far deeper recession.</p> <p>It looks as if infrastructure spending will be sacrificed to protect welfare and defence budgets \u2013 with the incursion into Ukraine aiding the armed forces\u2019 demand for a 30% budget boost.</p> <p>Russian companies that borrowed from western banks are also in trouble. The corporate sector tapped the west for cheap credit and must pay the interest on the loans in dollars at a time when a collapse in the rouble means dollars are more expensive. Oligarchs have lobbied Putin to help pay their loans. So far the president has said no, preferring to rely on the central bank defending the rouble by pushing interest rates to 17%.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4fab9f15a5fff75b545c28dfacf2c5f9259e419d\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/20/1419097588894/9e436a6a-9021-4990-8321-3cde50e2a397-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"A woman fills her car with petrol in Shahinshahr, Iran.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A woman fills her car with petrol in Shahinshahr, western Iran.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Moore/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>5. Iran</h2> <p>As one of the targets for both Saudi and US foreign policy, Tehran is in a bind. The government has increased spending to placate its westernised middle class at the very moment US sanctions and the low oil price are both eating into its budget. The US hopes that a deal is possible limiting Iran\u2019s nuclear ambitions while the Saudis want an end to Iranian-funded jihadis in the region. The first is possible and the second unlikely, but cash-for-terrorism could be more circumscribed following a prolonged period of low oil prices.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"df4a7d399d41916b5c905dc06be268112af08760\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/20/1419097343580/6fa225ae-07f8-4327-a67a-4650dcf10f86-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Saudi Arabia's oil minister Ali al-Naimi, right, talks to journalists before a meeting of Opec oil ministers in November.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil minister Ali al-Naimi, right, talks to journalists before a meeting of Opec oil ministers in November.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Heinz-Peter Bader/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>6. Saudi Arabia</h2> <p>The desert state has amassed a $1trn war chest to see it through periods of lower prices. Only last week a clearly relaxed finance minister Ibrahim Alassaf said his 2015 budget would go ahead despite \u201cchallenging\u201d global economic conditions.</p> <p>Alassaf has championed the kingdom\u2019s \u201ccounter-cyclical\u201d fiscal policy, which helped build up a mountain of foreign assets when oil prices were high. So while the world\u2019s top oil exporter is believed to need an average crude price above $90 a barrel to balance its budget, and a first budget deficit since 2009 will involve the sale of foreign assets to balance the books, it can survive for many years at $60 a barrel.</p> <p>And why would it do this? To limit the global production of oil and gas over the longer term, especially fracked oil and gas in the US and Europe, which have previously depended on Middle Eastern supplies. And, like the US, it wants to bring Iran to heel.</p>",
