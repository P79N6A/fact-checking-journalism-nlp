Under European law, the Regulation on Wholesale Energy Markets and Transparency (Remit) must be brought into force by the end ofJune, giving the UK only weeks to comply. The tougher measures \u2013 and fines \u2013 to be introduced by UK energy regulator Ofgem would make it easier to detect market manipulation and insider trading, partly by demanding that all trade deals be reported publicly. Two weeks ago the competition authorities from the European commission raided the offices of BP, Shell and the Norwegian oil group Statoil amid allegations of possible price collusion involving the price-reporting agency Platts. Last November, Ofgem and the then City watchdog, the Financial Services Authority, started their own investigation into the wholesale gas market following claims from a whistleblower about irregular trading patterns on a key date in the trading calendar. Caroline Flint, the shadow energy and climate change secretary, said on Friday night it \"beggars belief\" that the government was still dragging its heels over implementing protections to prevent market manipulation and insider trading given the allegations of price-fixing in the gas and oil markets. \"Labour has been warning ministers for months that opaque over-the-counter deals and relying on price-reporting agencies leaves the market vulnerable to abuse,\" she said. \"Consumers need to know that the prices they pay for their energy or petrol are fair, transparent and not being manipulated by traders.

The wider problems facing the country's energy sector will be highlighted early next week when ministers introduce the energy bill for its third reading in the House of Commons. The bill is designed to meet the twin needs of keeping the lights on and reducing carbon emissions at the same time as ensuring that household bills remain as low as possible. Next week could also see a long-awaited agreement on the level of a \"strike price\" between the government and EDF Energy, which would encourage the building of a new nuclear plant at Hinkley Point in Somerset.",

      "bodyText": "Protesters who picketed the European Central Bank on Friday are planning a second day of action across European cities as anger grows over austerity measures that many blame for taking eurozone unemployment to an all-time high. In rain and strong winds, members of the Blockupy movement cut off access to the ECB's Frankfurt headquarters and vowed to keep up the disruption on Saturday in a financial hub they describe as a seat of \"dictated austerity\". Their action came as official figures showed eurozone unemployment hit a new high last month with young people again the hardest hit \u2013 almost one in four are now out of work. Unemployment in the crisis-stricken currency bloc rose to 12.2% for April, according to Eurostat, the statistics office of the EU. At 24.4%, youth unemployment was double the wider jobless rate and up from 24.3% in March. The problem was most extreme in Greece where almost two-thirds of those under-25 are unemployed. The rate was 62.5% in February, the most recently available data. The numbers come days after eurozone leaders unveiled plans to get more young people into work as they faced warnings about the risks of civil unrest, long-term economic costs and fears that a generation could lose faith in the European project. In Frankfurt Blockupy protesters blamed the troika of institutions it says is pushing austerity measures on southern Europe: the ECB, the European Union and the International Monetary Fund. Blockupy's Roland S\u00fcss said: \"With the blockade of the ECB we are making the European resistance against the devastating poverty policy visible. It's an expression of our solidarity with the people in southern Europe whose existence is threatened by the austerity programmes.\" Blockupy, a European version of the Occupy Wall Street movement, put the number of activists blocking the ECB at 3,000. There was a more conservative estimate of between 1,000 and 1,500 from police, who used pepper spray to prevent the protesters breaking into the central bank's high-rise building. Protesters also targeted Deutsche Bank's headquarters and Frankfurt's airport. The movement and other anti-austerity groups are threatening rallies throughout European cities on Saturday, including London. While France and Germany responded to growing anger at youth unemployment this week with a new jobs plan, labour market experts warn that any measures will take time to turn the tide after 24 consecutive monthly rises in the jobless level. Economists say things will get worse before they get better for the 19.4 million people in the eurozone out of work. \"An end to the eurozone labour market downturn is not yet in sight,\" said Martin van Vliet, at ING Financial Markets. \"Even if the eurozone economy exits from recession later this year, the labour market is likely to remain in recession until next year.\" In the wider EU area unemployment stood at 11%, as the rate rose in all but nine countries compared with a year earlier. The biggest rises in overall joblessness on a year ago were in Greece, Cyprus, Spain and Portugal. Youth unemployment in Spain is 56.4%, in Portugal 42.5%. Italy recorded its highest overall unemployment rate since records began in 1977, at 12%, with youth joblessness at 40.5%. Economists said that the rise in unemployment was fairly broad-based with rises in so-called core countries as well, including Belgium and the Netherlands. The rate in France was 11%. Howard Archer, economist at IHS Global Insight, said: \"About the only positive spin that could be put on the eurozone unemployment data is that the rise has shown some signs of slowing overall in recent months. The increase has averaged 82,000 a month over the past three months compared with an overall average monthly increase of 158,000 in 2012.\" Ireland recorded one of the biggest falls in unemployment, down to 13.5% from 14.9% a year ago. That compares with a rate of 7.7% for the UK, where youth unemployment is 20.2%. The lowest rates for youth unemployment were in Germany at 7.5% and Austria at 8%. Labour market experts put the relatively low rates in Germany and Austria down to several factors. \"Germany and Austria have the strongest economies in Europe by some margin, but there are structural reasons the rates are low too,\" said Gary Browning, chief executive of Penna, a global human resources group. \"The way apprenticeships and vocational training work in Germany is fundamentally different, it is part of employers' mentality \u2026 there is a feeling that mid-sized companies have a moral obligation to train apprentices.\" The EU's latest plans to tackle youth unemployment include more apprenticeships under the so-called Youth Guarantee scheme to offer all under-25s a job, further education or training within four months of leaving education or losing a job.",

      "bodyText": "Time to close this Eurozone crisis live blog for today. Here is a summary of today\u2019s events before we go. \u2022 Thousands of Blockupy demonstrators were out in the rain in Frankfurt to cut off access to the European Central Bank in protest at what they see as its role in imposing austerity measures on southern European nations. Details and pictures throughout the day, starting at 8.22am. \u2022 Eurozone unemployment hit a fresh record high of 12.2%. Youth unemployment was double that at 24.4%. Coverage here from 10.01am, our story here and Larry Elliott\u2019s analysis here. \u2022 There was plenty more data from within the eurozone. Italy\u2019s jobless rate hit its highest level in at least 36 years. Retail sales in Germany fell unexpectedly in April. Consumer spending in France also fell in April. \u2022 US economic data was also in abundance. US consumer spending fell last month for the first time in almost a year. Business activity reaccelerated in May after contracting in April, according to the Institute for Supply Management-Chicago business barometer. The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan\u2019s consumer sentiment index rose to 84.5 from 76.4 in April. \u2022 In Athens, euro group chairman Jeroen Dijisselbloem was making waves during his first visit to the capital where the euro debt crisis began. Details from our correspondent Helena Smith at 4.42pm \u2022 On stock markets, the FTSE 100 ended the week lower and was down more than 1% on the day. French and German stock markets closed lower too, while on Wall Street the Dow Jones industrial average is currently close to the unchanged mark. \u2022 In Washington, the issue of Greek debt sustainability was expected to be the focus of talks when the International Monetary Fund\u2019s managing board meets to discuss dispensing another tranche of aid to the country. Details from Helena Smith in Athens at 6.31pm Finally, a quick look ahead to some key events next week. The ECB and Bank of England both announce their latest monetary policy decisions next Thursday. Economists expect Mervyn King\u2019s last meeting as governor will result in no change on either quantitative easing or interest rates. For the ECB no action is expected despite the growing pressure for it to kickstart economic recovery. And the week ends with the closely watched US non-farm payrolls report for May, with forecasts for more jobs to have been added, building on April\u2019s rise. Thank you for reading and commenting. We wish our readers a good weekend and will be back with more on Monday. KA &amp; GW And more from Helena Smith who says the issue of Greek debt sustainability is expected to be the focus of talks in Washington today when the International Monetary Fund\u2019s managing board meets to discuss dispensing another tranche of aid to the country. She writes: Debt relief is expected to be the name of the game when the Washington-based organisation's executive board meets to consent to the release of another slice of aid to Greece. Although the rescue funds - at 1.8bn euros far less than contributions from the EU but still vital to keeping the bankrupt Greek economy afloat - are expected to be approved, IMF officials have signalled that, once again, they will focus on the viability of Greece\u2019s debt load and the need for much of it to be forgiven if the country is ever to meet bailout targets of debt being reduced to 124% of GDP by 2020 and \u201csignificantly below\u201d 110 percent by 2022. The board is expected to discuss the body\u2019s latest bailout review on the economy\u2019s progress which makes no secret of the fact that debt sustainability is now among the nation\u2019s biggest problems. \"Greece's public debt remains much too high. It is therefore very welcome that Greece's European partners have now accepted that Greece could need significant exceptional support on below-market terms in order to restore debt sustainability and that they have committed to provide additional relief, if needed,\" the review states. The board meeting comes ahead of a two-week inspection tour by IMF mission chiefs which begins in Athens on 4th June. The socialist Pasok leader Evangelos Venizelos underlined the importance of debt forgiveness after attending a working lunch given in honour of visiting euro group chairman, Joroen Dijisselbloem, saying Greek society\u2019s tolerance for further austerity \u201chas reached the end of its limits.\u201d A quick update now on where things have got to in Frankfurt, where Blockupy protesters cut off access to the European Central Bank headquarters earlier today. Reuters reports from the city that demonstrators paralysed Germany's financial centre today, targetting the ECB, Deutsche Bank and the airport. Its correspondents write: Protesters against Europe's austerity policies, estimated by police at 1,500 but by Blockupy at 3,000, descended in the early hours on Frankfurt's financial district to disrupt business at institutions they blame for a deep recession in euro zone countries such as Spain and Greece. Riot police, showered with stones and paint bombs, used pepper spray to prevent the protesters breaking into the ECB. Several protesters were injured and police made some arrests, though they gave no numbers. Blockupy itself said it closed off the ECB for several hours. Spokesman Roland S\u00fcss added: We achieved our goal to block the Eurotower with mass blockades as we had announced. The ECB represents not only the European crisis management that serves the interest of major banks; it is also part of the Troika and thus a central actor in the politics of impoverishment that threatens the existence of the people in Europe, especially in southern European countries. Their protests come alongside official data showing eurozone unemployment has hit yet another record high, as we have been reporting here. On Saturday, Blockupy is vowing to stage a \"major demonstration\" in Frankfurt to coincide with protests in more than ten European cities. The FTSE 100 has closed down 1.1%, or 74 points, at 6583 mirroring losses on French and German stock markets. The Dax is down 0.6% at 8348.8 and the CAC40 in Paris lost 1.2% to 3948.6. Nicky Dale-Lace, senior sales trader at CMC Markets UK says traders looked to scale back risk heading into the month\u2019s end, with the central bank policy picture still unclear. The uncertainty in the broader market was reflected in the each way flow we\u2019ve seen on the Sales Trading desk at CMC, with client sentiment split almost 50/50 in the major indices. The exception to this has been the Nikkei, where we have seen brave souls stepping in to buy the dip in anticipation of a bounce next week. Over in Greece, our correspondent Helena Smith says euro group chairman Jeroen Dijisselbloem has been making waves during his first visit to the capital where the euro debt crisis began. She writes: The Dutch politician appears to have come to Athens to please \u2013 and to add weight to government insistence that more than three years after the crisis began, the sacrificial policies of austerity are finally paying off. Describing his talks with prime minister Antonis Samaras as \u201cvery useful\u201d, the euro group president said the Greek fiscal adjustment programme, which officially ends next year, was on track and insisted that he expected the country\u2019s economy to recover in 2014, if not earlier. The highly sensitive issue of Greece\u2019s monumental debt load being restructured for a second time \u2013 only this time by the official sector \u2013 was also discussed with Dijisselbloem leaving open the prospect of it being addressed by the euro group in April 2014, provided that Athens achieved a primary surplus first. \u201cWe have indeed decided that if Greece fully complies with its commitments [in the program], then we will be ready to do more to help it,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cWe will meet sometime before the summer [of 2014] to examine what more Greece might need, always under the condition that the targets that have been set are achieved.\u201d There is widespread recognition that whatever it does in the way of fiscal compliance, Greece will never be fully able to reduce a debt mountain that is projected to reach 185% of GDP by the end of 2013 at least to a manageable level. Dijisselbloem, who later met with the Greek finance minister Yiannis Stournaras, also addressed the thorny issue of unemployment now blighting Greece more than any other euro zone member. The Dutch politician repeated that the crisis-hit country was beginning to see the \u201cfirst signs\u201d of hope saying that EU measures to help support small and medium sized businesses would pave the way to thousands of jobs being created in a nation where over 27% of Greeks are now out of work. The Dow Jones industrial average has shaken off its early losses after a much stronger than expected reading in the latest business activity survey on the US Midwest and after a separate survey showed US consumer sentiment at its strongest in almost six years. Business reaccelerated in May after contracting in April, according to the Institute for Supply Management-Chicago business barometer. Its headline reading rose to 58.7 from 49 in April. The outturn well above the 50-mark that separates growth from expansion by far exceeded economists' expectations for 50 in a Reuters poll. Separately, the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index rose to 84.5 from 76.4 in April. It was the highest level since July 2007. Economists had forecast 83.7. Survey director Richard Curtin comments: The data clearly suggest a faster pace of growth in consumer spending during the year ahead than was anticipated even one month ago. The Dow Jones is currently bobbing around the unchanged mark, having slipped at the open earlier. The dollar has extended gains against the euro and the yen. For anyone wondering how that sentiment survey could translate into more spending, keep in mind that just a couple of hours earlier, separate data from the US government showed US consumer spending fell last month for the first time in almost a year, as reported here. Following that news earlier of yet another record high for eurozone unemployment, Larry Elliott, our Economics Editor, writes that the mistakes now being made in the eurozone mirror those in the United States and Germany early in the Great Depression Another month, another dismal set of jobless figures from the eurozone. Unemployment was up by 95,000 in April and if the trend of the past three months continues, an unenviable milestone will be reached by Christmas. At that point, there will be 20 million on the dole in the 17 nations that use the single currency. Europe now faces a triple crunch: an interlocking human, economic and political crisis that will have devastating consequences if left unattended. Read the rest of his comment here: Europe must act now to avert a devastating triple crunch Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics says that 0.2% drop in US consumer spending is \"not quite as bad as it looks\" since it partly reflects the drop back in gasoline prices. But he goes on to say it now looks like second-quarter GDP growth will be at the bottom end of Capital's 2.0% to 2.5% forecast range. Even in real terms, spending increased by only 0.1% month-on-month, dragged down by a 6.0% month-on-month drop back in spending on electricity and gas, as the unseasonably cold weather in March abated ... Income growth was also disappointing ... Overall, a sobering report for those expecting GDP growth to accelerate sharply. There will be some modest pick up in the second half of the year, as the fiscal drag starts to ease, but we expect the improvement to be very gradual rather than dramatic. Stock markets around Europe remain in negative territory and US futures are pointing to falls at the opening bell on Wall Street with downbeat news on US consumer spending adding to the pressure. Official data shows US consumer spending fell last month for the first time in almost a year. The Commerce Department reports that consumer spending fell 0.2%, the weakest reading since May 2012. That confounded economists' forecasts for a 0.1% rise in a Reuters poll. The news has knocked US crude oil futures by $1 to $92.61 a barrel. The dollar has also weakened, hitting a session low again the yen. Back in Europe, stock markets currently stand as follows: \u2022 FTSE 100: down 55 points at 6602, -0.8% \u2022 German DAX: down 50 points at 8350, -0.6% \u2022 French CAC: down 26 points at 3971, -0.6% More photos from the Blockupy protest have arrived: And with that, I\"m handing over to my colleage Katie Allen. Thanks all, and best wishes for the weekend. GW A quick reminder for regular readers and commenters that the Guardian\u2019s news community team are hosting a meet-up event at at the Guardian\u2019s offices at Kings Place in London, next Tuesday (4th June) It's an informal do - with drinks and nibbles and a chance to get to know other readers who contribute to our live blogs, followed by a Q&amp;A with the Guardian liveblogging team. From 6pm until 9pm. If you're interested in attending, please email james.walsh@guardian.co.uk. (incidentally, we did send out some invites to some of the most frequent comment posters. Apologies if you should have received one and didn't -- that may be due to spam filters, or because we have an out-of-date email address. Or it may be my oversight :( ) My colleague Katie Allen writes: Economists forecast that joblessness will get worse before it gets better in the eurozone. \"An end to the eurozone labour market downturn is not yet in sight. Even if the eurozone economy exits from recession later this year, the labour market is likely to remain in recession until next year,\" said Martin van Vliet, at ING Financial Markets. And here's her full story on today's record jobless levels, and the 19.4m people who are now out of work in the eurozone: Eurozone unemployment hits new high with quarter of under-25s jobless One of Blockupy's messages in Frankfurt is that activists don't just want a bigger share of capitalist cake - they've got their eye on the whole bakery: Felix Gottwald, a pilot, reports that security has been stepped up at Frankfurt airport in anticipation for the arrival of Blockupy protesters. Blockupy are targetting Deutsche Bank because of its role in food price speculation, which development charities say drives up costs for consumers. For people in the Third World world, that can mean going hungry. Several Gerrman financial institutions have abandoned the practice recently, bowing to public pressure. And Deutsche Bank may be following them. It emerged on Monday that the bank, Germany's largest, had written to German pressure group Foodwatch promising to end speculation in food commodities (more details here). The Blockupy demonstration is spreading out from the European Central Bank headquarters to two other targets \u2013 Deutsche Bank's headquarters, and Frankfurt airport. An aerial shot of the Blockupy protests in Frankfurt this morning: Here's AP's early take on Blockupy: Crowds of anti-capitalist protesters have blocked streets leading to the European Central Bank in Germany's financial capital, Frankfurt. They are demonstrating against what they say is the bank's role in enforcing government spending cutbacks across Europe aimed at ending the continent's debt crisis. Members of the Blockupy alliance linked arms and stood in groups Friday on streets leading to the bank. The ECB said it remained in operation, however. Police reported no arrests and estimated the number of demonstrators at between 1,000 and 1,500. Organizers said there were more than 3,000. Thousands of Blockupy protesters continue to circle the European Centrla Bank's headquarters in Frankfurt, Reueters estimates that there are 2,500 people -- while the organisation itself said there are 3,000. People are carrying signs with slogans such as \"humanity before profit\". They have been met by armed police wearing helmets and riot gear, accompanied by Alsatians. Here's more from Reuters: Trucks with water cannons stood by and a helicopter hovered overheard. At least 20 protesters held up inflatable mattresses with the slogan \"War Starts Here\" written on them. Police said some protesters had thrown stones and there were some clashes at the barricades, but the protest was generally peaceful so far. And this graph compares the eurozone unemployment rate, now at a record high of 12.2%, to other major economies: Not pretty. This graph shows how Europe's youth unemployment levels have steadily risen since the crisis began, but were already high in some countries. (click here for a larger version) Nearly one in four young people across the eurozone are now out of work, showing the desperate need for a new strategy on youth unemployment. The figures just released by Eurostat show that 3.624m young people are out of work across the euro area, and 5.627 million in the wider European Union. That means the jobless rate for 16-24 year olds in the eurozone is now 24.4%, up from 24.3% in March. An additional 180,000 young people joined the ranks of the jobless ove the last year. In the EU, the youth jobless rate is 23.5%. The worst rates, as ever, as recorded in Southern Europe -- exactly the countries which Blockupty say they are showing solidary with today. In Greece, 62.5% of young people are out of work, in Spain it's 56.4%, then Portugal with 42.5%, and then Italy with 40.5%. In contrast, the lowest rates were observed in Germany (7.5%), Austria (8.0%) and the Netherlands (10.6%). Leaders have pledged to agree a new strategy for youth unemployment at a summit in June, and many measures are lined up (details here). But the scale of the problem is huge, and worsening. Here's the official statement from Eurostat, confirming that the eurozone jobs crisis has worsened. The Eurozone unemployment rate has hit a new record high of 12.2% in April, up from 12.1%. More to follow I just spoke to a European Central Bank spokesman, who said that the Blockupy protests have not prevented the ECB from operating as usual. However, he wouldn't say how many staff have managed to get into work through the demonstrations outside, referring me to a statement issued on Wednesday. It reads: In view of the demonstrations planned in the city of Frankfurt in the course of the next few days, the Executive Board of the European Central Bank (ECB) has taken the necessary steps to ensure that the ECB remains operational. In liaison with local authorities, the ECB has also implemented measures to ensure the safety of its staff. He did agree, though, that some staff have taken today off. Thursday was a public holiday, meaning the chance of a four-day break. Back to Frankfurt, where Blockupy released a statement, declaring that 3,000 protesters have managed to surround the European Central Bank's headquarters. Blockupy speaker Ani Diesselmann explained: The blockade is standing. The business of the ECB is successfully disrupted. The Blockupy coalition has reached its first goal and more crisis actors will be marked during the day. We call up everyone to join our protests. Here's the statement: PM: ECB is blocked by 3000 Blockupy activists Blockupy added that the protest is an \"expression of our solidarity\" with Southern Europe, and confirtmed that it is planning \"further actions in the city and at the airport will follow this afternoon\" including Deutsche Bank's headquarters (see opening post) Another bleak point in the Italian jobless data is that March's unemployment rate has been revised sharply higher (to 11.9% from 11.5%). Prime minister Enrico Letta's challenge is even tougher than thought. It also shows the sharp differences between the industrialised north of the country and its southern regions -- where the jobless rate is twice as high. Italy's jobless rate has hit its highest level in at least 36 years. Data just released showed the unemployment rate rose to 12% in April, from 11.9% in March. The youth unemployment rate rose to 40.5%. Both figures are the highest since current records began in 1977. In an hour's time we get the new jobless rate for the whole eurozone - another record high again? Back to the Blockupy protests in Frankfurt, and here's a photo of German police officers leading away a demonstrator in front of the European Central Bank headquarters: Europe's stock markets have turned tail this morning, with the main indices all in the red. \u2022 FTSE 100: down 54 points at 6602, -0.8% \u2022 German DAX: down 75 points at 8312, -1% \u2022 French CAC: down 41 points at 3954, -1% \u2022 Spanish IBEX: down 100 points at 8334, -1.2% \u2022 Italian FTSE MIB: down 199 points at 17153, -1.1% This follows a calmer session in Asia, where Japan's Nikkei finished 1.5% higher following Thursday's 5% slide. Traders are talking about taking risk off the table, ahead of the next raft of economic data. There's also a rumour knocking around the City that Chinese manufacturing output, released tomorrow, has leaked early and is lower than expected. That's via Steve Collins, global head of dealing at London &amp; Capital Asset Management: Two pieces of economic news, neither all that good, have been released this morning. Retail sales in Germany fell unexpectedly in April, down 0.4% compared with March. Economists are pinning some of the blame on poor weather, but it may show German consumers are still cautious. Details here. And consumer spending in France also fell in April, dropping by 0.3%. That's better than the 0.6% contraction feared, but still a sign of a weak economy: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the latest developments across the eurozone and the global economy. Today could be dominated by protests and economic data, as demonstrators gather in Frankfurt to a rally against the handling of Europe's debt crisis. Members of the Blockupy movement \u2013 a European version of Occupy \u2013 hope to cut off access to the European Central Bank and other financial institutions in Frankfurt today. They are protesting against the economic policies which are being implemented in Southern Europe. As Blockupy spokesman Martin Sommer put it: The ECB is part of the troika and is one of those institutions responsible for pushing austerity measures and making people in southern Europe suffer. According to Reuters around 500 people have already moved into a camp on the western outskirts of Frankfurt. Busloads more are expected from Berlin, Italy and Spain today, which could push the total over a thousand. Here's the latest photos from Frankfurt: Blockupy are also protesting against other issues, including food price speculation. Reuters explains: In the afternoon, the demonstrators will divide up, with some blocking the entrance to Deutsche Bank's twin towers, to protest about food speculation and land grabbing. Activists have been asked to bring pots and pans to bang. A second group will head to the city centre to protest against rising rents, while around 200 will highlight racism and 'deportation' at Frankfurt airport, Europe's third busiest hub. The demonstration comes as we await the latest unemployment and inflation data from across the eurozone (both due at 10am BST). Economists fear the jobless rate could hit a new record high of 12.2%, up from 12.1% a month ago. Then, new US personal spending and consumption data will shine a light on the state of the American economy, as the financial markets continue to wonder when central banks might slow their stlmulus packages. As usual, I'll be tracking all the events across the eurozone and beyond....",

She writes:</p> <p>Debt relief is expected to be the name of the game when the Washington-based organisation's executive board meets to consent to the release of another slice of aid to Greece. Although the rescue funds - at 1.8bn euros far less than contributions from the EU but still vital to keeping the bankrupt Greek economy afloat - are expected to be approved, IMF officials have signalled that, once again, they will focus on the viability of Greece\u2019s debt load and the need for much of it to be forgiven if the country is ever to meet bailout targets of debt being&#xa0;reduced to 124% of GDP by 2020 and \u201csignificantly below\u201d 110 percent by 2022. </p> <p>The board is expected to discuss the body\u2019s latest bailout review on the economy\u2019s progress which makes no secret of the fact that debt sustainability is now among the nation\u2019s biggest problems.</p> <p>\"Greece's public debt remains much too high. It is therefore very welcome that Greece's European partners have now accepted that Greece could need significant exceptional support on below-market terms in order to restore debt sustainability and that they have committed to provide additional relief, if needed,\" the review states.&#xa0;</p> <p>The board meeting comes ahead of a two-week inspection tour by IMF mission chiefs which begins in Athens on 4th June. The socialist Pasok leader Evangelos Venizelos underlined the importance of debt forgiveness after attending a working lunch given in honour of visiting euro group chairman, Joroen Dijisselbloem, saying Greek society\u2019s tolerance for further austerity \u201chas reached the end of its limits.\u201d</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-51a8d535e4b00a6ab14f1b62\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-05-31T16:52:37.548Z\">5.52pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Blockupy vows more action on Saturday</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-3ad572c2-59e1-4521-a8b8-67d8c47ac143\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/5/31/1370019094388/5ca7350d-14ac-44da-899e-18ebf6c1bb33-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Demonstrators struggle with German police as part of the Blockupy protests outside Frankfurt airport.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Demonstrators struggle with German police as part of the Blockupy protests outside Frankfurt airport.

Its correspondents write:</p> <blockquote> <p>Protesters against Europe's austerity policies, estimated by police at 1,500 but by Blockupy at 3,000, descended in the early hours on Frankfurt's financial district to disrupt business at institutions they blame for a deep recession in euro zone countries such as Spain and Greece. </p> <p>Riot police, showered with stones and paint bombs, used pepper spray to prevent the protesters breaking into the ECB. Several protesters were injured and police made some arrests, though they gave no numbers.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://blockupy-frankfurt.org/en/category/press/\">Blockupy itself said it closed off the ECB for several hours</a>.

      "bodyText": "A survivor of a deadly Bangladeshi garment factory fire and a former child labourer will make their way to Bentonville, Arkansas, next week to protest at the annual meeting of retail giant Walmart. Lobby group Making Change at Walmart raised over $9,000 on the crowdsourcing site Indiegogo this week to bring the two former garment workers over from Bangladesh. Sumi Abedin, a survivor of the deadly fire that killed at least 112 garment workers at the Tazreen Fashion factory on the outskirts of Dhaka, Bangladesh in 2012, and Kalpona Akter, a former child worker, will join a growing protest against the retailer's work practices and buying policies. Pressure for change has been mounting on retailers worldwide since the collapse of the Rana Plaza building in Savar, Bangladesh, in April that claimed 1,127 lives and left thousands more injured. Walmart has fired suppliers in the wake of the tragedy and announced independent factory inspections.

The exit of Vodafone and its partner China Mobile in advance of Monday's deadline for final bid submissions leaves the field clear to 11 others, including the currency speculator George Soros, who has teamed up with Irish telecoms entrepreneur Denis O'Brien. Campaign groups have warned companies against doing business in newly liberalised Burma before the country relaxes its controls on access to information and freedom of expression. Under laws enacted by the former military government, anyone in Burma owning a fax machine or modem or setting up a computer network requires a licence. The government can penalise citizens who \"spread false news\" or publish anything on the internet compromising national security. Vodafone said it had withdrawn after seeing the final licence conditions, which were published on 20 May, because \"the opportunity does not meet the strict internal investment criteria to which both Vodafone and China Mobile adhere\". A spokeswoman for Vodafone added that among the British company's concerns were that a promised telecommunications bill overhauling regulation of the sector is now not due to be enacted before Burma finalises its choice of foreign mobile operator on 27 June.

As the group pointed out earlier this month the US is increasingly reliant on imported food, and, increasingly, that food comes from China. According to the government accountability office (GAO), the percentage of imported food consumed in the US almost doubled from 9% to 16% between 2000 and 2011.

In 2007 the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) received reports that several thousand cats and dogs had died and thousands more became ill after eating contaminated cat food.

      "bodyText": "Another month, another dismal set of jobless figures from the eurozone. Unemployment was up by 95,000 in April and if the trend of the past three months continues, an unenviable milestone will be reached by Christmas. At that point, there will be 20 million on the dole in the 17 nations that use the single currency. Europe now faces a triple crunch: an interlocking human, economic and political crisis that will have devastating consequences if left unattended. Let's start with the human cost. At present, the jobless rate in the eurozone is 12.2% \u2013 the highest since the single currency was created at the end of the 1990s. Among the under-25s, the situation is even worse: one in four are unemployed. The phrase \"lost generation\" can be over-used: on this occasion it is entirely appropriate to describe what is happening in Greece, where the youth jobless rate is approaching two-thirds of the young population. Somewhat belatedly, eurozone policymakers have woken up to the social costs of the austerity programmes that have been enacted in a blanket fashion across the single currency. Studies of the labour market show that youth unemployment leaves deep scars that blight the chances of those affected throughout their life. Mass unemployment among young people also has the habit of spilling over into unrest and violent protest, as the Arab spring showed. The economic crisis is caused by the unwillingness or the inability to realise that macro-economic policy in the eurozone is bankrupt. The mistakes made in Europe \u2013 a failure to loosen monetary policy aggressively enough and a tightening of fiscal policy during recession \u2013 mirror those made in the United States and Germany during the early stages of the Great Depression. There is a marked and growing divergence between unemployment in the US and the eurozone that can be attributed to two factors: the Federal Reserve has been prepared to embrace quantitative easing on a grand scale and the European Central Bank has not; and fiscal policy in the eurozone has been relentlessly pro-cyclical, with taxes raised and spending cut even when it was clear economies were going down the tubes. The eurozone's prolonged slump has forced some modest changes to deficit reduction plans, giving some member states longer to hit their targets. But Europe still appears a long way from embracing the sort of strategy that would start to bring the jobless total down. In part, that's because there is still a belief that the impediments to growth are all structural and have nothing to do with a deficiency of demand. In part, it's because the country where this belief is most entrenched \u2013 Germany \u2013 has an unemployment rate of 7.5%, low by eurozone standards. Danny Gabay at the London-based consultancy Fathom rightly points out that the eurozone needs to rebalance and can only do this in one of two ways: Germany reflates and enables the countries in trouble to grow a bit faster and bring down their unemployment rates; or Germany does nothing and every other country deflates, leading to ever-higher joblessness. If Europe continues to make the wrong choices, a political crisis looms. It has always been assumed in European policy-making circles that a break-up of the single currency needs to be avoided because it would plunge the eurozone into recession. This, though, is mistaking cause and effect. As things stand, it looks more likely that Herbert Hoover economics and the resultant mass unemployment will destroy the euro.",
