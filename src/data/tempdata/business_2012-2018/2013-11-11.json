    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "BSkyB has been very successful over the years in squashing upstart competitors in football and sports broadcasting. The company, however, has never faced a rival like an invigorated BT. In a battle of chequebooks, the key statistic to bear in mind is that BSkyB currently generates free cash flow of about \u00a31bn a year whereas BT, utterly transformed over the past five years, throws off about \u00a32.3bn. This is a new game. Or, as Bernstein's analysts put it, \"the end of peaceful co-existence in the UK telecom and TV worlds\". For the time being, BSkyB can console itself that Champions League football accounts for only 3% of viewing across its sports channels. BT's expensively-acquired three-year rights for European competitions also kick in only from the 2015-16 season, which leaves BSkyB time to assess the damage. It is in the fortunate position of having 85% of its sports rights secured for the next three years. But the soul-searching can't last for very long. The open question is what happens when bidding opens for the next set of Premier League rights, probably in mid-2015. Sky currently has the bigger and better package by far. But if BT were to overpay in similar style for Premier League leadership, BSkyB, for the first time in its history, could no longer credibly claim to be the home of live televised football in the UK. Would its sport offer still be big enough and broad enough to overcome the blow? It would be a brave management that took that gamble. Monday's 11% fall in BSkyB's share price reflects what's at stake in 2015: BSkyB may have to pay a truly colossal sum to defend its Premier League status. And it is reasonable to assume that, at the very least, BT would not want to take a backwards step on Premier League rights in 2015. So should BSkyB chief executive Jeremy Darroch preserve cash now with the aim of fighting and winning comprehensively in 2015? Or does he invest elsewhere in sports to manage, and reduce, the risk of a further loss to BT? Tricky. From BT's point of view, it can make a fair argument that the cost of an entry ticket to the top tier of sports broadcasting is a reasonable investment. It has 7m broadband subscribers, versus BSkyB's 5m, and the management would be receiving flak if the gap closed much further. There may be easy ways to recoup some of the \u00a3900m outlay on Uefa rights via wholesaling deals; and the purchase looks a sensible way to fill the gaping hole in BT Sports' current midweek schedule. As long as BT can maintain the pledge that its financial outlook is unchanged shareholders should be reassured. That said, BT's shareholders should not celebrate too wildly a victory in a \"six pointer\", as chief executive Gavin Patterson described it. There will be a response from BSkyB. RSA audit This is a company that seems to only deliver bad news Does the discovery of \"accounting irregularities\" during a routine internal audit offer evidence that an insurer is able to detect problems as a matter of course? Or, when the irregularities are so serious that they cause a \u00a370m hit to profits, does it mean problems should have been spotted earlier? In the case of RSA, which revealed the \u00a370m hole in its claims reserves in Ireland late on Friday, a definitive answer will have to wait until accountants PwC have completed their work. That could take until the new year. In the meantime, investors know one thing about RSA: it is a company that seems to deliver only bad news. The dividend was cut earlier this year and Friday's shocker, which sent the shares down 10% on Monday, was the second profits warning in a week. Last Tuesday's version was an extended grumble about storm damage and unrelated whiplash claims in Ireland. In theory, the new Irish issue is a one-off, but, as Oliver Steel at Deutsche Bank put it: \"Oscar Wilde's Lady Bracknell would possibly have something to say about the frequency.\" RSA chief executive Simon Lee says he is \"comfortable\" with the City's forecasts that the dividend can be maintained at the reduced level. But comfortable is not a description one would apply to the dividend cover itself. On Deutsche's forecast, RSA would be distributing 6.4p a share to investors from earnings of 6.8p. There is no room there for any more \"one-offs\". Lee's position seems safe for now. But he needs a full and glowing endorsement of the robustness of RSA's controls.",

    "webTitle": "University economics teaching to be overhauled", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "An overhaul of university economics teaching will begin next year in answer to critics who argue that economists failed to spot the 2008 crash because they ignored the impact of financial markets and relied on outdated theories. A new first year curriculum will be available from the start of the 2014 academic year which will include an in-depth review of economic history and a look at the way financial markets can undermine economic stability. Wendy Carlin, an economics professor at University College London, who heads the project, said several universities had expressed an interest in adopting the new curriculum, including Sydney, Warwick and UCL. Speaking at a conference hosted by the Treasury, Carlin said students needed to debate conflicting theories of how economies work and understand that while markets often are successful, they sometimes fail. She said some academics argued that reforms should take the form of \"nicer, smarter, cooler examples of the real world\", but a more fiundamental overhaul was needed to give students a deeper and broader understanding of the subject. Much of the syllabus is being written by academics and economic consultants on a voluntary basis with technical support from Azim Premji University in Bangalore. The course materials, plus supporting teaching materials, will be available at \"no cost to participating institutions\". The project, which was launched last month, is backed by the New York-based Institute for New Economic Thinking, which was created in 2009 with financial backing from the financier George Soros. Some academics have argued that economics has become locked in a time warp, teaching theories that ignore the advent of the internet, the end of the Cold War and the threat of climate change. Juliet Schor, a professor from Boston College said economics teaching needed to illustrate how a rise in fossil fuel consumption can cause damage to others thousands of miles away. \"Humans share a biosphere and it is possible for people to cause huge harm to others on the other side of the world, she said, adding: \"We should include environmental and carbon footprint accounting alongside GDP.\" An element of environmental economics is included in the new curriculum. But Carlin refused to answer concerns that the project will be of limited use unless some of the largest universities adopt the new scheme. There are fears that the dominance of mathematical modelling in the current economics syllabus will be defended by senior figures in academia because it supports candidates who want to make a career in banking and finance. Students at Manchester University, who formed the post crash economics society earlier this year, have complained that their course is dominated by mathematical modelling based on out-dated theories. Professor Michael Joffe, an economist at Imperial College, said space could be made in the curriculum if academics could admit that many theories were \"plain wrong\" and should not be taught.",

The course materials, plus supporting teaching materials, will be available at \"no cost to participating institutions\".</p> <p>The project, which was launched last month, is backed by the New York-based Institute for New Economic Thinking, which was created in 2009 with financial backing from the financier George Soros.</p> <p>Some academics have argued that economics has become locked in a time warp, teaching theories that ignore the advent of the internet, the end of the Cold War and the threat of climate change.</p> <p>Juliet Schor, a professor from Boston College said economics teaching needed to illustrate how a rise in fossil fuel consumption can cause damage to others thousands of miles away. \"Humans share a biosphere and it is possible for people to cause huge harm to others on the other side of the world, she said, adding: \"We should include environmental and carbon footprint accounting alongside GDP.\"</p> <p>An element of environmental economics is included in the new curriculum.</p> <p>But Carlin refused to answer concerns that the project will be of limited use unless some of the largest universities adopt the new scheme.</p> <p>There are fears that the dominance of mathematical modelling in the current economics syllabus will be defended by senior figures in academia because it supports candidates who want to make a career in banking and finance.</p> <p>Students at Manchester University, who formed the post crash economics society earlier this year, have complained that their course is dominated by mathematical modelling based on out-dated theories.</p> <p>Professor Michael Joffe, an economist at Imperial College, said space could be made in the curriculum if academics could admit that many theories were \"plain wrong\" and should not be taught.</p>",

Shire, best known for drugs for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), will pay $50 a share for Pennsylvania-based ViroPharma, a biopharmaceutical company with a lucrative pipeline of products targeted at rare diseases. Biopharmaceuticals are medical drugs made with biological components such as proteins, blood or cells, and are a crucial growth area for the pharmaceutical sector, which is under pressure as exclusivity patents expire on profitable blockbuster drugs. ViroPharma shares shot up by 25% when Wall Street's Nasdaq exchange opened on Monday , while Shire was the biggest climber on the FTSE 100 index of leading shares in early trading, up about 2.5% on the day. Rare diseases, also known as orphan diseases, were traditionally shunned by pharmaceutical companies, which had little incentive to pour resources into treatments for conditions that may affect only one person in 2,000.

The agency currently expects GDP to contract 7% this year compared with its previous forecast of nearly 9% and after declining 2.4% in 2012. The economy is likely to remain in deep recession in 2014 with the downturn lasting longer than assumed under the EU-IMF programme.</p> <p>The one-notch differential between the local currency issuer default ratings (CCC) and the foreign currency ratings (B-) reflects Fitch's assessment of the greater vulnerability of bonds issued under domestic law relative to foreign-law bonds, as demonstrated by the 2013 restructuring of domestic law bonds, which revealed a preferential treatment of foreign-law sovereign bonds.</p> </blockquote> <p>The full statement is here:</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.fitchratings.com/creditdesk/press_releases/detail.cfm?pr_id=807652&amp;origin=home\">Fitch affims Cyprus at B-/CCC</a></h2> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-528101cbe4b0f37bee4ff4f8\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-11T16:29:45.241Z\">4.29pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Olli Rehn: EC may probe German trade surplus</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Olli Rehn, the European Commissioner for the euro, has revealed that the EC will decide this week whether to launch a probe into Germany's trade surplus.</strong></p> <p>He made the disclosure in a blogpost about&#xa0;one of the thorniest issues in the eurozone -- Germany's trade surplus, which the US Treasury recently blamed for inflaming the eurozone crisis.</p> <p>It's here:&#xa0;</p> <h2><a href=\"http://blogs.ec.europa.eu/rehn/turning-germanys-surplus-into-a-win-win-for-the-eurozone/\">Turning Germany\u2019s surplus into a win-win for the eurozone</a></h2> <p>Rehn attributes the large German surplus to three factors -- protection from an appreciating currency, access to cheaper labour, and the financial convergence across Europe (<em>so that profits made in Germany were invested in Southern European countries rather than financing consumption at home</em>).</p> <p>In short, his message was that&#xa0;Germany's export success is a more complicated issue than some critics admit. However, it's an issue the EC might not be able to ignore...</p> <p>Rehn wrote:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Because these important issues deserve further analysis, the European Commission will this week need to consider whether to launch an in-depth review of the German economy in the framework of the EU\u2019s Macroeconomic Imbalances Procedure. Such a review would provide both European and German policymakers with a detailed picture of the economic challenges and opportunities facing the eurozone\u2019s largest economy.</p> </blockquote> <p>For balance, Rehn then reminded readers that France needs to pull its finger out too:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Of course, Germany is not the only country whose policies have spillover effects on the rest of the eurozone. As the two largest eurozone economies, Germany and France together hold the key to a return to growth and employment in Europe.</p> <p>If Germany can take steps to lift domestic demand and investment, while France embraces reforms to its labour market, business environment and pension system to support competitiveness, they will together do a great service to the entire eurozone \u2013 providing stronger growth, creating more jobs and reducing social tensions.</p> </blockquote> <p><em>If, if....</em></p> <p>Anyway, the FT's top man in Brussels, <strong>Peter Spiegel</strong>, reckons Rehn's comments are pretty significant:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Thanks to&#xa0;new powers given to Brussels&#xa0;in the wake of the eurozone crisis, he can force countries to revise their economic policies \u2013 including an oversized current account surplus \u2013 through something soporifically known as the Macroeconomic Imbalance Procedure.</p> <p>On Wednesday, Rehn will announce his decision on whether Germany will be put in the dock for exactly what the US has been accusing it of: building up a current account surplus at the expense of its trading partners. And if Rehn\u2019s blog post is any indication, he\u2019s heading in exactly that direction.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ObsoleteDogma/statuses/399907602047315969\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Does Brussels agree with Washington that Germany&#39;s current account surplus is too big?

Disagreement remains over its size and measures necessary to close it. While the government insists the hole is around \u20ac0.5bn and that no more cuts are possible, the Troika's estimates lie in the \u20ac2-3bn range, meaning more austerity is inevitable.</p> <p>Furthermore, the government has to close four milestones-including the transfer of another 2.5K workers into the so-called \"mobility scheme\" as well as shutting down a number of public defense companies-in order to unlock approximately \u20ac1bn outstanding from the previous review. Beyond these issues, there remains no political agreement on more money for Greece. However, new sums will be needed to close the financing gap for end-2014, extend the program till Q1 2016 and progress debt relief once Greece's primary surplus has been verified by Eurostat, on April 22 next year.</p> <p>The need for immediate agreement is not particularly pressing. The government can afford to go on for some time before it needs more cash, and even then, could issue more T-bills and/or build up arrears to meet whatever market or domestic fiscal constraints arise. Although the IMF is more skeptical, they have limited appetite to kick up a fuss. Their financial contribution is small and they foresee bigger fights on the horizon that they care about (i.e. debt relief).&#xa0;</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-11-11T14:03:26.675Z\">at 2.03pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5280d0dae4b0541f62c72e53\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-11T13:05:54.810Z\">1.05pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Over in Ireland, there have been protests against the forced rescue of <strong>Newbridge Credit Union.</strong></p> <p>Yesterday, the Central Bank of Ireland stepped in and asked <a href=\"http://www.irishtimes.com/search/search-7.1213540?tag_company=Permanent%20TSB&amp;article=true\">Permanent TSB</a>&#xa0;to take over Newbridge's assets and liabilities, fearing that the organisation was close to collapse.

BT Sport has won exclusive rights to broadcast the tournament, a huge blow to Sky and a monumental statement of intent from BT as it tries to grab a foothold in the UK TV market. However, this has come at a cost, a whopping \u00a3897m over 3 years which has been questioned by rivals. Both SKY and ITV, who have a number of years of experience to draw on, do not think the price represents value, but perhaps in the context of BT\u2019s plans it may be worth paying up. The market reaction certainly sees this as a huge loss for SKY, with the stock down 9% from the kick off.</p> <p>One thing is for sure, unless you are happy to pay the extra for a BT channel on your SKY box, there will either be a wave of customers switching allegiance or thousands of UK football fans looking for a new hobby on Tuesday and Wednesday nights.&#xa0;</p> </blockquote> <h2><strong>Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets</strong></h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>While expensive, some might consider today\u2019s acquisition price attractive given BT\u2019s recent success in improving its customer retention after it began offering BT sports (football, rugby, others) for free in October to all broadband subscribers, and it obviously had to pay a premium for exclusive rights which are worth more than a shared offering. Could today\u2019s news help customer retention reverse to customer poaching, hurting Sky further? Or will brand loyalty prevail and Sky subscribers just change to BT Broadband to allow them to view BT\u2019s sports offering via Sky, and so both providers benefit? As an Arsenal fan, it\u2019s got me thinking, however, longer-term I\u2019m wary of having to pay yet another monthly fee when BT becomes sole broadcaster of mid-week football.

Democratic Left, a coalition partner for a year to June 2013, voted \"present.\"</p> <p>Absentees included 3 Golden Dawn lawmakers, including the party's leader and deputy leader, who have been jailed since October on charges of belonging to a criminal organization.</p> <p>The no confidence motion was tabled Thursday, a few hours after Greek riot police ended a nearly five-month protest by sacked workers broadcasting from what was once the headquarters of the defunct ERT state broadcaster, removing a few dozen people occupying the complex.</p> <p>The government, under pressure by Greece's international creditors to reform the public sector, had suddenly decided to close ERT in June, in a move heavily criticized by most opposition parties and the Democratic Left, which used the issue as an occasion to leave the coalition. The government has since set up a new, leaner broadcaster, with one channel instead of the previous three.</p> <p>Although the motion of no confidence had limited chances of passing, SYRIZA used the debate to lambast the government for its policies. SYRIZA leader Alexis Tsipras accused the coalition government of being \"under foreign control\" and of taxing the poor to protect the rich.</p> <p>Prime Minister Antonis Samaras&#xa0;replied by accusing SYRIZA of frequently changing its positions in a populist grab for votes, supporting often violent reactions to government policies, and always rejecting necessary spending cuts.

But with Veterans Day in the US leading to light dealing volumes, markets remained relatively calm. \u2022 The FTSE 100 finished up 19.95 points or 0.3% higher at 6728.37, but BSkyB and RSA were notable fallers \u2022 Germany's Dax edged up 0.33% to 9107.86 \u2022 France's Cac closed 0.7% better at 4290.14 \u2022 Italy's FTSE MIB added 0.77% to 19,107.85 \u2022 Spain's Ibex ended 0.43% higher at 9789.5 \u2022 But the Athens market bucked the trend, down 0.26% at 1165.99 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 0.1%. And on that note, it's time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments and we'll be back tomorrow. Ratings agency Fitch has confirmed Cyprus' foreign and local bond ratings at B- and CCC, with a negative long term outlook. Fitch said: An external EU-IMF programme supports the sovereign's near term liquidity position, although downside risks are substantial. The economic outlook remains bleak despite growth so far in 2013 performing better than Fitch's previous expectations. The agency currently expects GDP to contract 7% this year compared with its previous forecast of nearly 9% and after declining 2.4% in 2012. The economy is likely to remain in deep recession in 2014 with the downturn lasting longer than assumed under the EU-IMF programme. The one-notch differential between the local currency issuer default ratings (CCC) and the foreign currency ratings (B-) reflects Fitch's assessment of the greater vulnerability of bonds issued under domestic law relative to foreign-law bonds, as demonstrated by the 2013 restructuring of domestic law bonds, which revealed a preferential treatment of foreign-law sovereign bonds. The full statement is here: Fitch affims Cyprus at B-/CCC Olli Rehn, the European Commissioner for the euro, has revealed that the EC will decide this week whether to launch a probe into Germany's trade surplus. He made the disclosure in a blogpost about one of the thorniest issues in the eurozone -- Germany's trade surplus, which the US Treasury recently blamed for inflaming the eurozone crisis. It's here: Turning Germany\u2019s surplus into a win-win for the eurozone Rehn attributes the large German surplus to three factors -- protection from an appreciating currency, access to cheaper labour, and the financial convergence across Europe (so that profits made in Germany were invested in Southern European countries rather than financing consumption at home). In short, his message was that Germany's export success is a more complicated issue than some critics admit. However, it's an issue the EC might not be able to ignore... Rehn wrote: Because these important issues deserve further analysis, the European Commission will this week need to consider whether to launch an in-depth review of the German economy in the framework of the EU\u2019s Macroeconomic Imbalances Procedure. Such a review would provide both European and German policymakers with a detailed picture of the economic challenges and opportunities facing the eurozone\u2019s largest economy. For balance, Rehn then reminded readers that France needs to pull its finger out too: Of course, Germany is not the only country whose policies have spillover effects on the rest of the eurozone. As the two largest eurozone economies, Germany and France together hold the key to a return to growth and employment in Europe. If Germany can take steps to lift domestic demand and investment, while France embraces reforms to its labour market, business environment and pension system to support competitiveness, they will together do a great service to the entire eurozone \u2013 providing stronger growth, creating more jobs and reducing social tensions. If, if.... Anyway, the FT's top man in Brussels, Peter Spiegel, reckons Rehn's comments are pretty significant: Thanks to new powers given to Brussels in the wake of the eurozone crisis, he can force countries to revise their economic policies \u2013 including an oversized current account surplus \u2013 through something soporifically known as the Macroeconomic Imbalance Procedure. On Wednesday, Rehn will announce his decision on whether Germany will be put in the dock for exactly what the US has been accusing it of: building up a current account surplus at the expense of its trading partners. And if Rehn\u2019s blog post is any indication, he\u2019s heading in exactly that direction. It's a fight where nearly everyone is taking sides. Late last week, Open Europe published a comprehensive case for the German defence: US and Germany trade blows over macro policy, but is Germany's export focus really to blame for the woes of the eurozone? Britain's inflation rate could drop to a six-month low when the monthly measure of the cost of living is released tomorrow. Analysts reckon the Consumer Prices Index will drop to 2.5% in October, down from 2.7% in September. Closer to the Bank of England's 2% target, but still outpacing wage increases - and well above inflation in the eurozone. (0.7%). More here: UK inflation rate expected to fall in new CPI report Over to Greece again. The Athens government has been asserting that last night's no-confidence vote strengthened its negotiating position with international inspectors visiting the country. But behind the scenes, officials are painting a different story - and suggesting Troika negotiations will probably drag into January. Our correspondent Helena Smith has the story: Once again, we are seeing a government moving fast to glean whatever benefit it can from a political event deemed to have gone its way. Within seconds of the no confidence motion being rejected, senior officials were hailing it as one of the best indicators yet that Greeks had trust in government polices presently fixing the country\u2019s dire economic straits. Makis Voridis, the ruling New Democracy party\u2019s parliamentary spokesman, continuing in the same vein, insisted this morning that the vote would \u201cstrengthen Greece\u201d in its ongoing negotiations with the troika. Within hours of that statement being made, senior finance ministry officials were quietly acknowledging that it would be a \u201cminor miracle\u201d if the talks are over by Christmas. As mentioned at 2.03pm, mission heads representing the EU, ECB and IMF unexpectedly cancelled a meeting today with Kyriakos Mitsotakis, the administrative reform minister and rescheduled another with the finance minister Yannis Stournaras for Tuesday. Back to Helena: Insiders say Stournaras, who will now have two meetings with the auditors tomorrow, has been \"put on the defensive\" as much by the delays as by the nature of the measures the troika is now demanding both in return for the country\u2019s next cash instalment of \u20ac1bn - crucial to covering government expenditure \u2013 and resolving the ever vexing question of its looming budget gap. \u201cFrom what we know they [the inspectors] will follow the minister to the next Euro group on Thursday but after that we have no idea if they will be coming back [to continue negotiations]\u201d one official conceded. Everything could be put on hold until December, he added. With barely two weeks before the Greek government present its 2014 budget to parliament, officials had been hoping that negotiations would wrap up before then \u2013 giving the finance ministry enough time to be able to focus on filling the country\u2019s looming fiscal hole at the next Euro group meeting on December 9th. Greek officials worry that foreign lenders are in no rush to complete negotiations because their \u201cbottom line\u201d is more austerity measures which will almost certainly require time to pass. All on a day when the labour ministry - confirming the fears of most - announced that more than 35,000 jobs more were lost than created in October once again worsening the record levels of joblessness in Greece. Twitter shares have taken an early slide, dropping 5% at the start of its third day as a listed company. Shares in the popular micro-blogging service dropped $2.1 in early trading to $39.54, having begun trading at $45.10 on Thursday. Still a big premium on the $26/share IPO price, of course, but fuel for critics who reckon Twitter has been overvalued. Otherwise, it's a pretty calm start on Wall Street where the Dow Jones industrial average is up 19 points, or 0.1% It's Veterans Day in America, and traders on Wall Street marked it with a two-minute silence and a standing ovation for a group of US veterans. Traders expect a quiet day in the US stock market. Bond markets are closed. Borut Hocevar, a political analyst at daily Finance, is confident that Slovenia's government will win its own confidence vote, due on Thursday (see this earlier post for details): Via Reuters: \"The government coalition continues to support [prime minister Alenka] Bratusek in spite of some differences between the parties,\" said Hocevar. But he said winning the vote would not solve Slovenia's financial problems, which depend on the cost of tackling some \u20ac7.9bn ($10.6 billion) of bad loans - more than a fifth of economic output - at mainly state-owned banks. Stress test results for Slovenia's banks are due on December 13, which should show how much money the sector needs. Back to Greece, and government negotiations with the International Monetary Fund/EC/ECB officials will resume tomorrow, not today as initially planned. The troika had been due to meet administrative reform minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis this afternoon to discuss progress towards laying off 4,000 civil servants by the end of this year. That meeting is now postponed until tomorrow, apparently to allow the troika to see finance minister Yannis Stournaras first. There seems no chance that the troika inspectors will conclude their visit to Athens in time for this month's meeting of eurozone finance ministers, on Thursday. Mujtaba Rahman of Eurasia Group reckons that agreement on this troika review and Greece's 2014 financing gap won't come until December's eurogroup meeting, or possibly the one in January 2014. That's not a reason to panic, as Greece's borrowing requirements are covered for the next few months. Rahman writes: The biggest issue remains the fiscal gap for 2014. Disagreement remains over its size and measures necessary to close it. While the government insists the hole is around \u20ac0.5bn and that no more cuts are possible, the Troika's estimates lie in the \u20ac2-3bn range, meaning more austerity is inevitable. Furthermore, the government has to close four milestones-including the transfer of another 2.5K workers into the so-called \"mobility scheme\" as well as shutting down a number of public defense companies-in order to unlock approximately \u20ac1bn outstanding from the previous review. Beyond these issues, there remains no political agreement on more money for Greece. However, new sums will be needed to close the financing gap for end-2014, extend the program till Q1 2016 and progress debt relief once Greece's primary surplus has been verified by Eurostat, on April 22 next year. The need for immediate agreement is not particularly pressing. The government can afford to go on for some time before it needs more cash, and even then, could issue more T-bills and/or build up arrears to meet whatever market or domestic fiscal constraints arise. Although the IMF is more skeptical, they have limited appetite to kick up a fuss. Their financial contribution is small and they foresee bigger fights on the horizon that they care about (i.e. debt relief). Over in Ireland, there have been protests against the forced rescue of Newbridge Credit Union. Yesterday, the Central Bank of Ireland stepped in and asked Permanent TSB to take over Newbridge's assets and liabilities, fearing that the organisation was close to collapse. The High Court gave its approval last night, with the state providing around \u20ac54m to help cover the credit union's problems. It is thought to be the first time a credit union has been taken over by a bank in Ireland. The Irish Times has a Q&amp;A here. The Irish central bank said the take-over by Permanent TSB was the only way to avoid Newbridge being liquidated, potentially meaning losses for deposit holders over \u20ac100,000. However some members of the credit union, who used to own and control it, are not happy. An Action Group has been formed, which staged a protest against the takeover outside the credit union in Newbridge. There are some photos, and reaction, on Twitter: It's a dark day for UK retail generally, with video store Blockbuster also falling into administration alongside Barratt Shoes. My colleague Sarah Butler writes: More than 3,000 retail jobs are at risk just weeks before Christmas as the film rental chain Blockbuster and shoe shop Barratts announced they were going into administration. Both retailers have called administrators before. Blockbuster was among a string of well-known high-street brands to go bust at the beginning of the year. More here: Blockbuster and Barratts enter administration, threatening 3,000 jobs This, alas, is the third time that Barratts has fallen into administration since the financial crisis began. It first hit trouble in in 2009, leading to 2,500 job losses and the closure of 220 of its 380 stores. It called in the administrators again back in December 2011, leading to another 600 job cuts and further closures as its former owner bought part of the chain back. Just in, the Barratts Shoes chain has fallen into administration, putting more than 1,000 jobs at risk. Administrators from Duff &amp; Phelps have taken control of Barratts Trading Limited, which employs 1,035 people in the UK and Ireland, including 521 full-time staff, across 75 stores and 23 concessions. They hope to sell it as a going concern, but warned that \"redundancies and/or store closures cannot be ruled out\" at this stage. Philip Duffy, Duff &amp; Phelps partner said: Difficult trading conditions in the sector led the Directors to explore potential refinancing options and additional equity for the business. The Company had recently received an offer from an investor to inject \u00a35m into the Company but that offer was withdrawn on the evening of the 7th November. In view of the financial position of the Company and withdrawal of that equity offer the Directors were left with no choice but to appoint Administrators. In the City, BSkyB has now slumped to the bottom of the FTSE 100 fallers list, down 9.6% today after losing the rights to broadcast the Champions League football. BT shares, though, have turned positive after an early wobble. They're up 0.5% as analysts digest its decision to usurp Sky with a bid of almost \u00a3300m per year for three years (see 8.22am for more details). The deepening battle between the two companies has got the City talking - here's some reaction: Nick Dale-Lace of CMC Markets: After years of ceremoniously flicking between Sky sports and ITV to keep up to speed with the Champions League, football fans will be mourning the loss of the competition from 2015\u2026\u2026\u2026unless they have BT. BT Sport has won exclusive rights to broadcast the tournament, a huge blow to Sky and a monumental statement of intent from BT as it tries to grab a foothold in the UK TV market. However, this has come at a cost, a whopping \u00a3897m over 3 years which has been questioned by rivals. Both SKY and ITV, who have a number of years of experience to draw on, do not think the price represents value, but perhaps in the context of BT\u2019s plans it may be worth paying up. The market reaction certainly sees this as a huge loss for SKY, with the stock down 9% from the kick off. One thing is for sure, unless you are happy to pay the extra for a BT channel on your SKY box, there will either be a wave of customers switching allegiance or thousands of UK football fans looking for a new hobby on Tuesday and Wednesday nights. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets While expensive, some might consider today\u2019s acquisition price attractive given BT\u2019s recent success in improving its customer retention after it began offering BT sports (football, rugby, others) for free in October to all broadband subscribers, and it obviously had to pay a premium for exclusive rights which are worth more than a shared offering. Could today\u2019s news help customer retention reverse to customer poaching, hurting Sky further? Or will brand loyalty prevail and Sky subscribers just change to BT Broadband to allow them to view BT\u2019s sports offering via Sky, and so both providers benefit? As an Arsenal fan, it\u2019s got me thinking, however, longer-term I\u2019m wary of having to pay yet another monthly fee when BT becomes sole broadcaster of mid-week football. And how much that monthly fee is could well be the decider. It's been a fairly calm start to the week's trading across Europe's stock markets, where the Greek stock market is lagging slightly behind other indices. FTSE 100: up 16 points at 6725, +0.26% (of which more shortly....) German DAX: +0.13% French CAC: +0.27% Italian FTSE MIB: +0.38% Spanish IBEX: flat Greek ATG: -0.05% Friday's decent US jobs report isn't providing much cheer today, as IG analyst Alastair McCaig explains: The FTSE, along with the rest of Europe, is finding it hard to shake off last week\u2019s worries about the health of the eurozone, particularly following European Central Bank president Mario Draghi\u2019s unexpected rate cut. Regardless of how optimistic the US markets were at the close of last week, troubles on our own doorstep are now taking precedence as European traders begin to employ a considerably more conservative approach. Another vote of confidence looms in the eurozone, this time in Slovenia. Reuters reports that the Slovenia's parliament will hold a vote of confidence on Thursday. It's another challenge for a government that is fighting to recapitalise its banking sector and avoid asking for international aid. Here's more details: A parliamentary spokeswoman said on Monday that the confidence motion would be linked to a vote on amendments to the 2014 budget. Analysts expect Prime Minister Alenka Bratusek's centre-left government to win the vote.With the amendments, the government is raising taxes, particularly those on real estate, in an attempt to consolidate the state budget and enable Slovenia to avoid having to ask for outside aid. Slovenia's largely state-owned banking sector is riddled with almost \u20ac8bn of bad debts. Last month, the IMF urged Bratusek to complete the clean-up job quickly, amid concerns that the recapitalisation process may cost more than officially estimated. Back in Greece, prime minister Antonis Samaras has tweeted a statement declaring that his government is \"more enhanced\" after defeating the no-confidence motion shortly after midnight. Samaras also pledged that parliamentary elections will take place in 2016 as planned, despite some analysts predicting his government won't last that long. Meanwhile Theodora Tzakri, the Pasok MP who defied her leadership and supported the no-confidence motion, has issued her own statement. Tzakri criticised Samaras's government's 'social harshness' and 'democratic deficit', saying: My fellow citizens put their trust in me so I would confront the serious problems, not to rubber stamp e-mails from our lenders. This government is characterized by a surfeit of social harshness, incapability, a democratic deficit and lack of plan to exit the crisis. That's via the Kathimerini newspaper. Malta's prime minister, Joseph Muscat, has become the latest eurozone politcian to welcome last Thursday's cut in eurozone interest rates. Reuters reports: 11-Nov-2013 09:53 - MALTA PM MUSCAT, AT NEWS CONFERENCE WITH ITALY PM LETTA, SAYS LAST WEEK'S RATE CUT IS SIGNAL THAT ECB WANTS TO SUPPORT GROWTH Italy and France applauded the European Central Bank's move last week, but Germany declined to comment. The Financial Times report this morning that the rate cut could dent relations between Frankfurt and Berlin. Italian industrial production has fallen for 10 quarters in a row, despite a small improvement in September. Statistics body ISTAT reported this morning that industrial output across Italy shrank by 1.0% in the third quarter of 2013, despite inching up by 0.2% in September. For the first nine months of 2013, total output has shrunk by 3.9% as Italy's economy suffered its deep, ongoing recession. It's a big morning for pharmaceutical news. Pharma giant Shire is taking control of US company ViroPharma, a leader in the treatment of rare diseases, in a $4.2bn deal. Shares in Dublin-based Shire are leading the FTSE rises, up 3.4%, as the City welcomes the move (even though Shire's paying a 27% premium). It will give Shire access to ViroPharma's Cinryze drug, which treats the inflammatory condition hereditary angioedema. Bloomberg has a good take. Meanwhile, AstraZeneca has good news for workers in Cheshire. It has pledged \u00a3120m to build a new facility at its global manufacturing site, in Macclesfield, for the production of its prostate cancer drug Zoladex. This will guarantee 300 jobs at the site, and create another 200 temporary positions, it said. It's been welcomed by chancellor George Osborne (whose Tatton constituency is next to Macclesfield). UK airline Flybe has shocked workers and unions with plans to cut up to 500 jobs. The Exeter-based firm announced a new cost-cutting plan this morning, despite reporting a pre-tax profit of \u00a313.8m in the last six months (from a \u00a31.6m loss in 2012). Its new CEO, Saad Hammad, warned that he's taking \"tough decisions\", adding: The business needed action now and so today we are explaining our next phase which encompasses a review of everything we do and how we do it. It's a blow to the firm's 2,700 staff, who have already endured previous redundancy rounds. As Jim McAuslan, Balpa's general secretary, put it: This is a distressing day for the dedicated pilots who loyally serve Flybe and its passengers day-in day-out and we will be supporting them throughout this difficult redundancy process. Unite is also pledging to scrutinise Flybe's plans closely. Its national officer Oliver Richardson said: Cabin crew have already been through one major reorganisation at Flybe only recently and they will be angry that once again they are on the front line of more cuts. This is clearly a very difficult time and Unite will be doing everything possible to provide support to the workforce. Over the coming weeks the union will scrutinise every inch of the company's business plans in order to protect as many jobs as possible and to avoid compulsory redundancies. The company has been open with the union about its plans and we hope to use this relationship in order to mitigate the impact of this decision. RSA Insurance's shares have been pummelled this morning, as shareholders react to Friday night's profit warning and the launch of an investigation into its Irish business. RSA is the biggest faller on the FTSE 100, falling over 15% in early trading. This follows the news that RSA had injected fresh capital into its Irish unit after discovering various \"issues\". RSA Ireland's CEO, chief financial officer and claims director have all been suspended. RSA is giving a conference call this morning, so we may learn more soon..... We reckon that more than \u00a31bn has been knocked off BSkyB's value by this morning's 8% share price drop: In the City, shares in BT have fallen over 2% in early trading after the telecoms firm splashed out almost \u00a3900m to broadcast European club soccer games over the next three years. Investors may fear BT has scored an own goal by paying twice the previous rate for the rights to the Champions League and Europa League. But that's less dramatic than the 8% rout suffered by BSkyB, which has lost the rights. ITV, its partner, are down 3.1%. BT has already been forced onto the defensive over its record-breaking bid to transfer the rights onto BT Sport in the current economic climate. John Petter, head of BT's consumer division, told us yesterday that: The thing that is good for the economy is to put competition into the market and to reduce the pressure on household budgets,\" he said. \"In difficult times people deserve access to sport; sport brings people together and has a cohesive effect on community. Here's our full story: BT defends big bet on Champions League as customers face price rises Here's Associated Press's full report on last night's confidence vote in Athens: Greek government survives no confidence motion Greece's conservative-socialist coalition government survived a no-confidence motion tabled by the main opposition Radical Left Coalition (SYRIZA) party early Monday, following an often heated three-day parliamentary debate. The motion fell well short of the 151 votes needed to pass, with 124 lawmakers voting in favor and 153 against, Parliament speaker Evangelos Meimarakis announced after the roll-call vote was completed. One socialist lawmaker voted in favor of the motion and was promptly expelled from her party's parliamentary group. Besides SYRIZA, the motion was supported by the Communist Party, the right-wing populist Independent Greeks and the extreme right Golden Dawn. Democratic Left, a coalition partner for a year to June 2013, voted \"present.\" Absentees included 3 Golden Dawn lawmakers, including the party's leader and deputy leader, who have been jailed since October on charges of belonging to a criminal organization. The no confidence motion was tabled Thursday, a few hours after Greek riot police ended a nearly five-month protest by sacked workers broadcasting from what was once the headquarters of the defunct ERT state broadcaster, removing a few dozen people occupying the complex. The government, under pressure by Greece's international creditors to reform the public sector, had suddenly decided to close ERT in June, in a move heavily criticized by most opposition parties and the Democratic Left, which used the issue as an occasion to leave the coalition. The government has since set up a new, leaner broadcaster, with one channel instead of the previous three. Although the motion of no confidence had limited chances of passing, SYRIZA used the debate to lambast the government for its policies. SYRIZA leader Alexis Tsipras accused the coalition government of being \"under foreign control\" and of taxing the poor to protect the rich. Prime Minister Antonis Samaras replied by accusing SYRIZA of frequently changing its positions in a populist grab for votes, supporting often violent reactions to government policies, and always rejecting necessary spending cuts. He defended the ruling coalition's program, saying it would result in a primary budget surplus this year excluding spending on servicing the country's debt and enable the government to start borrowing from the markets again by the end of 2014. Greece has been surviving on international rescue loans from the International Monetary Fund and other European countries that use the euro since 2010, after a combination of dismal financial stewardship, loss of investor confidence and the global recession brought it to the brink of bankruptcy. Successive governments have passed repeated rounds of deep spending cuts and tax hikes to secure \u20ac240bn ($324bn) in bailout loans. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the global economy, the eurozone and the business world. Let's start with Greece, where the Athens government is getting back to work after surviving a confidence vote late last night. Both sides managed to lose something, after a lengthy debate of the Greek austerity programme. Syriza, the left-wing opposition party, saw its no-confidence motion defeated - and only mustered relatively small crowds outside the parliament building. But prime minister Antonis Samaras's majority was whittled down by one, after a member of the coalition Pasok party voted against him. Theodora Tzakri MP was promptly thrown out of Pasok's parliamentary party, giving Samaras just 154 members of the 300-seat parliament. The two sides traded insults in the run-up to the vote. Syriza's leader, Alexis Tsipras, accused Samaras of destroying Greek society, warning that: Thousands of people are looking in the rubbish for food. And asking: Do you sleep well at night, Mr Prime Minister? Samaras, though, accused Tsipras of blundering by launching his attack (following the expulsion of workers from the former state broadcaster's offices last week.) Samaras said: You chose the wrong moment to play parliamentary theatrics, in a time when the government is in crucial negotiations with the troika. In the event, just 124 lawmakers voting in favour of Syriza's no-confidence vote and 153 against, with the Democratic Left party (which quit Samaras's coalition this summer) abstaining. Most of the debate was a rehash of old arguments about Greece's austerity programme, according to the excellent MacroPolis website, which reports: The discussion revolved largely around the now entrenched pro- and anti-memorandum arguments, which voters have heard ad nauseum. SYRIZA attempted to add another dimension to the debate by drawing attention to the ways in which government policy is testing the boundaries of democracy. Focussing on the example of how public broadcaster ERT was shut down, the leftists accused New Democracy and PASOK of ignoring Parliament in order to pass laws to meet troika targets. Here's their full analysis: Scars for coalition, questions for SYRIZA after confidence vote. So, a no-score draw -- at a time when Athens is holding its latest round of talks with its international lenders. They continue to push Samaras to find new cost-saving methods. The government continues to insist that it won't impose further pay and benefit cuts, or tax rises. I\"ll be tracking reaction from Greece on the vote, along with other developments through the day...",

In a rare insight into the pressure top employees try to put on boards over their pay levels, Sir Philip Hampton said he had been contacted \"quite a lot\" by bankers wanting bigger pay deals via email and in face to face meetings. Since becoming chairman of RBS after its \u00a345bn bailout five years ago \u2013 it is now 81% owned by the taxpayer \u2013 Hampton has had to fend off repeated criticism of the bonuses paid to investment bankers and to former chief executive Stephen Hester. But the 60-year-old admitted to being surprised by the demands made by some staff. \"I can tell you I've had some completely out of body experiences in recent years where I was talking to somebody about potentially getting a \u00a34m pay package. And outrage coming across the table from the other side because they know that somebody doing a comparable job at another bank is getting \u00a36m. This is absolutely outrageous to them, that somebody is getting 50% more,\" he said. Speaking at a debate in London organised by the High Pay Centre, the Freidrich Ebert Stiftung foundation and the Guardian, Hampton did not name the banker who had been disappointed by the \u00a34m deal. On an intellectual basis he could understand the argument, he said, if not the feeling about the size of the payment. It illustrated \"part of the different world that can be inhabited\", said Hampton, who attends meetings of the remuneration committee but does not have a formal seat on the board committee that sets pay. He receives \u00a3750,000 a year. Hampton, who started his career as an investment banker at Lazard and became finance director of British Steel in the mid 1990s, said that in banking, expectations of bonuses had become \"deeply embedded\". He said it was part of banking culture to work for your bonus, but considered that the power of bonuses to motivate staff was \"overrated\". However, he did not oppose bonuses as a way to pay staff because they were effective in aligning them with shareholders \u2013 especially as payouts could be clawed back if performance turned out not to be as good as it first seemed. In 2012, he said, bonuses in the investment bank were 80% lower and the top 10,000 staff did not get pay rises. The culture of bonuses being paid regardless of performance led to the EU capping them at a single multiple of salary \u2013 or twice with the approval of shareholders. The government is challenging the bonus cap, which regulators fear could push up fixed salaries. Barclays has been discussing the possibility of handing its bankers an allowance to make up for lost bonuses and Hampton would not disclose RBS's proposals for pay once the cap comes into force on 1 January. \"There will probably be some inflation of base pay,\" Hampton said. But, he warned, the impact could be to increase fixed costs for the bank. Some aspects of bonuses had encouraged unwanted behaviour, he said, citing incentives to sell payment protection insurance that have left the industry with a \u00a320bn bill to compensate customers. \"It is absolutely possible to have incentives that are disastrous. That was the case with PPI.\"",

      "bodyText": "BSkyB could be forced to pay an extra \u00a31.2bn to secure the next set of Premier League broadcast rights after its shock loss to rival BT in an auction of live Champions League and Europa League football matches. The predicted soaring cost of football rights, as well as the realisation that the sports pay television market may now have a serious second player, led to a stark reassessment of BSkyB's value, which slumped by \u00a31.6bn on the stock exchange on Monday as its shares fell almost 11%. The share price movement followed BT Sport's shock announcement of its exclusive \u00a3897m three-year deal with European governing body Uefa to broadcast 350 fixtures a season from 2015. BSkyB had been expected to retain most of its current rights to Europe's leading club tournament. Matthew Walker, a media analyst with investment bank Nomura, wrote in a note to investors: \"Regardless of whether BT can monetise [its Champions League] outlay, it shows that they are not content to be the number two sports service, which has big implications for the next Premier League auction in mid-2015. This is really a must-win for Sky and we raise our inflation assumption to 60% from 40% (up another \u00a3156m per annum). Sky cannot afford to be [financially] disciplined on this one.\" Sky's current Premier League deal is worth about \u00a32.3bn, which gives it rights to show 116 games a season until 2015-16 and is a 40% hike on what it paid at the previous auction. Nomura now predicts that the price will be nearer \u00a33.5bn from the start of the 2016-17 season \u2013 a sum likely to intensify the debate over the finances of football and particularly the pay of players, who have been the chief beneficiaries of soaring broadcast rights costs. BSkyB declined to predict what it might pay in future auctions, although the importance of English football to the channel is clear. The Champions League accounts for less than 3% of total viewing across Sky Sports, against 19% for the Premier League. While the Premier League may gain indirectly from BT's move into Champions League, the loss of the rights is being seen as a major blow for BSkyB and ITV, which currently share the rights to the tournament. Sky said BT's bid for the deal was \"far in excess\" of its own, while ITV said it was \"not prepared to pay over the odds\". At \u00a3299m a year over the three years, BT is paying more than double the \u00a3400m BSkyB and ITV are paying for the current three-year Champions League contract. The stock market viewed the developments differently, however. The fall in BSkyB shares cut the value of the company to \u00a313.2bn, while shares in ITV edged down by 1.6%. But shares in BT Group, a newcomer to sports broadcasting after launching its limited Premier League service at the start of this season, rose slightly after initial losses amid fears that it had massively overpaid. BT's sports channels are available on its BT Vision TV service, on Virgin Media and on Sky. Nick Dale-Lace, senior sales trader at CMC Markets, described it as \"a huge blow to Sky and a monumental statement of intent from BT as it tries to grab a foothold in the UK television market\". He added: \"Both Sky and ITV, who have a number of years of experience to draw on, do not think the price represents value, but perhaps in the context of BT's plans it may be worth paying up.\" BT Sport made its debut on 1 August, and the group said its financial outlook was unchanged despite the latest deal, adding that the rights would improve revenue and profit in its consumer division in the \"medium term\". Announcing the deal on Saturday, the newly appointed BT chief executive, Gavin Patterson, hailed it as \"giving sport back to the fans\". He defended the amount paid, saying it injected \"a welcome element of competition\" into the market. The head of BT's consumer division, John Petter, said: \"These were the crown jewels properties for Sky. I'm sure they'll be kicking themselves today. I feel for them obviously, but they got it wrong.\"",

    "webTitle": "Blockbuster and Barratts enter administration, threatening 3,000 jobs", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "More than 3,000 retail jobs are at risk just weeks before Christmas as the film rental chain Blockbuster and shoe shop Barratts announced they were going into administration. Both retailers have failed before. Blockbuster was among a string of well-known high-street brands to go bust at the beginning of the year, while it is the third time Barratts has fallen into administration in less than five years. There were also further job losses at regional airline Flybe, which said it was cutting 500 jobs in an attempt to save \u00a326m a year, having struggled in a downturn that disproportionately affected economies outside London. The retail collapses reflect ongoing troubles in the economy as inflation has continued to outstrip low wage increases, whittling down consumers' spare cash. This year has seen the failure of a string of retail casualties, including music retailer HMV, Jessops camera shops and bed specialist Dreams, all of which were later rescued by buyers who took on at least some of the stores and employees. But both Barratts and Blockbuster face an uphill struggle to survive after falling out of step with the fast-changing habits of shoppers. \"Consumers and the retail market have moved on,\" said Maureen Hinton, research director at retail analysis firm Verdict. \"The economic downturn has only speeded up the exit of weaker players that would have found it difficult anyway.\" She said the Barratts brand and its products were not strong enough to compete with clothing retailers such as Primark, New Look and the supermarkets, which now sell footwear as well as clothing. Blockbuster, meanwhile, is based on an \"outdated concept\" that has been overtaken by downloads and TV subscription services. Philip Duffy and David Whitehouse of Duff &amp; Phelps, joint administrators for Barratts, said they hoped to sell the business as a going concern but that store closures and redundancies could not be ruled out. Barratts, which employs 1,035 people at 75 stores and 23 concessions in the UK and Ireland, had sought additional investment after a period of difficult trading but the offer of a \u00a35m cash injection was withdrawn on 7 November. \"In view of the financial position of the company and withdrawal of that equity offer the directors were left with no choice but to appoint administators,\" said Duffy. The appointment of administrators at Blockbuster comes just a month after the retailer's owner, Gordon Brothers, admitted that its turnaround strategy had not worked because of a rapid switch to renting films online or via TV subscription services. The restructuring specialist bought about half of Blockbuster's original UK chain in March and promised to invest substantial sums in a revival plan to protect around 2,000 jobs. But Gordon Brothers was unable to secure a licensing deal with Blockbuster's parent company in the US, which also recently filed for bankruptcy, to launch an online business. Nick O'Reilly, a joint administrator, said: \"Gordon Brothers found the marketplace had changed quite dramatically. A lot of people want to rent online, while the price of DVDs on places like Amazon is so cheap \u2013 why rent for \u00a33?\" Blockbuster's 264 stores will remain open while the administrator, Moorfields Corporate Recovery, looks for a buyer. But O'Reilly admitted it would be a tough job to find a new owner for Blockbuster in its current form given that Gordon Brothers had already spent weeks seeking a buyer. Joint administrator Simon Thomas said: \"This is obviously a difficult and upsetting time for everyone involved at Blockbuster, in particular employees, who have endured a stressful period since January this year.\" \"We appreciate that staff and customers will want a speedy resolution, however, we must ask people to be patient over the coming weeks.\" Flybe had already cut 490 jobs under its previous boss. Its new chief executive, Saad Hammad, said it had been clear the cost savings were necessary, but the company needed to do more and do it immediately. He said jobs would go \"across the ranks: pilots, cabin crew, engineers management. It's unfortunate it needs to be done to be relevant and viable. We've got to secure the business \u2013 it's the lesser of two evils.\" The Unite union said it would scrutinise the business plan to limit job cuts. National officer Oliver Richardson said: \"Cabin crew have already been through one major reorganisation at Flybe only recently and they will be angry that once again they are on the front line of more cuts. \"Over the coming weeks, the union will scrutinise every inch of the company's business plans in order to protect as many jobs as possible and to avoid compulsory redundancies.\"",

      "body": "<p>More than 3,000 retail jobs are at risk just weeks before Christmas as the film rental chain Blockbuster and shoe shop Barratts announced they were going into administration.</p> <p>Both retailers have failed before. Blockbuster was among a string of well-known high-street brands to go bust at the beginning of the year, while it is the third time Barratts has fallen into administration in less than five years.</p> <p>There were also further job losses at regional airline Flybe, which said it was cutting 500 jobs in an attempt to save \u00a326m a year, having struggled in a downturn that disproportionately affected economies outside London.</p> <p>The retail collapses reflect ongoing troubles in the economy as inflation has continued to outstrip low wage increases, whittling down consumers' spare cash. This year has seen the failure of a string of retail casualties, including music retailer HMV, Jessops camera shops and bed specialist Dreams, all of which were later rescued by buyers who took on at least some of the stores and employees.</p> <p>But both Barratts and Blockbuster face an uphill struggle to survive after falling out of step with the fast-changing habits of shoppers.</p> <p>\"Consumers and the retail market have moved on,\" said Maureen Hinton, research director at retail analysis firm Verdict. \"The economic downturn has only speeded up the exit of weaker players that would have found it difficult anyway.\"</p> <p>She said the Barratts brand and its products were not strong enough to compete with clothing retailers such as Primark, New Look and the supermarkets, which now sell footwear as well as clothing. Blockbuster, meanwhile, is based on an \"outdated concept\" that has been overtaken by downloads and TV subscription services.</p> <p>Philip Duffy and David Whitehouse of Duff &amp; Phelps, joint administrators for Barratts, said they hoped to sell the business as a going concern but that store closures and redundancies could not be ruled out.</p> <p>Barratts, which employs 1,035 people at 75 stores and 23 concessions in the UK and Ireland, had sought additional investment after a period of difficult trading but the offer of a \u00a35m cash injection was withdrawn on 7 November.</p> <p>\"In view of the financial position of the company and withdrawal of that equity offer the directors were left with no choice but to appoint administators,\" said Duffy.</p> <p>The appointment of administrators at Blockbuster comes just a month after the retailer's owner, Gordon Brothers, admitted that its turnaround strategy had not worked because of a rapid switch to renting films online or via TV subscription services.</p> <p>The restructuring specialist bought about half of Blockbuster's original UK chain in March and promised to invest substantial sums in a revival plan to protect around 2,000 jobs. But Gordon Brothers was unable to secure a licensing deal with Blockbuster's parent company in the US, which also recently filed for bankruptcy, to launch an online business.</p> <p>Nick O'Reilly, a joint administrator, said: \"Gordon Brothers found the marketplace had changed quite dramatically. A lot of people want to rent online, while the price of DVDs on places like Amazon is so cheap \u2013 why rent for \u00a33?\"</p> <p>Blockbuster's 264 stores will remain open while the administrator, Moorfields Corporate Recovery, looks for a buyer. But O'Reilly admitted it would be a tough job to find a new owner for Blockbuster in its current form given that Gordon Brothers had already spent weeks seeking a buyer.</p> <p>Joint administrator Simon Thomas said: \"This is obviously a difficult and upsetting time for everyone involved at Blockbuster, in particular employees, who have endured a stressful period since January this year.\"</p> <p>\"We appreciate that staff and customers will want a speedy resolution, however, we must ask people to be patient over the coming weeks.\"</p> <p>Flybe had already cut 490 jobs under its previous boss. Its new chief executive, Saad Hammad, said it had been clear the cost savings were necessary, but the company needed to do more and do it immediately.</p> <p>He said jobs would go \"across the ranks: pilots, cabin crew, engineers management. It's unfortunate it needs to be done to be relevant and viable. We've got to secure the business \u2013 it's the lesser of two evils.\"</p> <p>The Unite union said it would scrutinise the business plan to limit job cuts. National officer Oliver Richardson said: \"Cabin crew have already been through one major reorganisation at Flybe only recently and they will be angry that once again they are on the front line of more cuts.</p> <p>\"Over the coming weeks, the union will scrutinise every inch of the company's business plans in order to protect as many jobs as possible and to avoid compulsory redundancies.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Insurance group RSA has a fight on its hands to reassure investors over its problems in Ireland after its shares plunged 11%, making them the biggest faller in the FTSE 100, following the suspension of senior executives and an emergency \u20ac100m (\u00a384m) capital injection into its Irish business. Late last Friday, the group suspended the chief executive, chief financial officer and claims director of its Irish operations over what it said were \"issues\" identified in the country's claims and finance functions. It is understood the problems relate to the timing of the booking of large losses and earned premiums, mostly over the past two years but with some dating back to earlier periods. The insurer said the problems, identified in a routine audit, were likely to wipe \u00a370m off profits, and it has injected \u20ac100m into the Irish business to ensure that its solvency ratio was \"comfortably in excess of 200%\". It has appointed PwC to carry out an investigation and why the issue remained undetected until last week. PwC will look into the financial and regulatory reporting processes and controls in place, and report back to the board before the end of the year. Simon Lee, RSA's group chief executive, said on Monday: \"These are very serious and disappointing events. Clearly something has gone wrong in Ireland and we are investigating that. I am confident that these issues are isolated to the Irish business.\" He said he could not elaborate on why he was so confident the events were isolated to Ireland while the investigation was ongoing. Lee added: \"No policyholders have been affected and all our Irish businesses continue to operate as normal.

Our capital position remains robust and we remain committed to our dividend policy which is aligned with market expectations for the full year final 2013 dividend.\" The latest issues compounded RSA's difficulties after the insurer previously indicated that its personal motor insurance business in Ireland was experiencing more frequent and higher-cost injury claims. As a result of the trend, RSA issued a profits warning last week, saying it was likely the group would have to strengthen its Irish bodily injury reserves, adversely affecting the group's 2013 performance. The company has also been hit by extreme weather events, including floods in Canada and the wind storm suffered in Northern Europe last month. \"2013 is proving to be a difficult year for the group, compounding the impact of the extreme weather we've seen,\" Lee said on Monday.",
