      "bodyText": "The construction industry faces \u201cinexorable decline\u201d unless radical steps are taken, according to an independent review that urges the government to support the building of rental properties and affordable housing. The government-commissioned review, carried out by the property consultancy boss Mark Farmer, calls for tax incentives and planning breaks to boost the burgeoning build-to-rent sector. A growing number of institutional investors and some developers such as Berkeley Homes are building blocks of rental homes. Farmer argues that build-to-rent can play a crucial role in changing the industry, as rental demand is more stable, while traditional housebuilders build homes for sale and are more dependent on the economic cycle. Traditional housebuilders have also been accused of hoarding land to maximise profits, but have rejected those claims. The report calls on the government to increase the construction of social and affordable homes by registered providers. It argues that much of this housing can be built more quickly and cheaply using pre-manufactured modules rather than traditional bricks and mortar. Farmer, a 25-year veteran of the industry, believes the UK should take the global lead in producing off-the-shelf components for housing. One example is Legal &amp; General\u2019s new factory in Sherburn, Yorkshire, the largest modular housing factory in the world, which will produce homes through automated processes used to make cars and other consumer goods. Another is the drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline\u2019s \u201cfactory in a box\u201d, which contains multi-coloured components packed in reverse order for quick assembly. It has been developed for emerging markets and cuts the construction time from 12 weeks to four. Farmer said: \u201cIf you buy a new car, you expect it to have been built in a factory to exacting standards, to be delivered on time, to an agreed price and to a predetermined quality. This needs to happen more in construction.\u201d Essential Living, which specialises in private rental homes, is building one of the tallest modular buildings in the UK at Greenwich Creekside Wharf with 249 rental homes (including a quarter at market discount rent). The fully fitted-out factory-made modules will be stacked around a concrete core, which is estimated to reduce the construction period by 25%. To tackle Britain\u2019s worsening housing crisis, the Farmer review calls for the construction of 50,000 pre-manufactured homes a year, on top of 160,000 traditional homes. The report paints a gloomy picture of the construction industry, blighted by low productivity, an ageing workforce, a lack of innovation and collaboration as well as a non-existent research and development culture. Surging costs, driven by a shortage of skilled workers, have stalled numerous housing schemes that have become too expensive to build, such as Galliard Homes\u2019 Capital Homes project in east London. \u201cThe prognosis for the industry, if action is not taken quickly, is that it will become seriously debilitated,\u201d Farmer warns. He highlights the \u201cticking timebomb\u201d posed by a shrinking workforce, which could decline by 20-25% within a decade. More people are leaving than joining the industry each year and Brexit is likely to exacerbate the situation by restricting the inflow of foreign workers. He puts forward an action plan to modernise the industry and boost housebuilding, including a \u201ccarrier bag charge-style\u201d penalty. This envisages levying a tax of 0.5% of a scheme\u2019s construction cost on businesses that commission work that does not support industry innovation and skills development. The report calls for an overhaul of training by reforming the Construction Industry Training Body\u2019s grant funding model; along with a joined-up construction strategy pursued by the government, construction industry and clients. Farmer\u2019s recommendations also include a land value tax for big infrastructure projects. The industry minister, Jesse Norman, said: \u201cThis government is determined to support more housebuilding, more quickly and in the places people want to live. Given the launch of the \u00a33bn home building fund, Mark Farmer\u2019s important review in this vital sector is very timely. It makes a strong case for change in the industry, identifies areas where it needs to improve, and sets out areas for action. We will now carefully consider his recommendations.\u201d Paul Stanworth, the managing director of Legal &amp; General Capital, the insurer\u2019s main investment division, said: \u201cWith such a chronic shortage of homes in the UK \u2026 we sincerely hope that Farmer\u2019s review galvanises the entire sector to invest in innovation and secure its future.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Banks could start making decisions to move assets out of the UK as early as the end of 2017 if there is no deal in place to maintain their rights to sell services freely across the European Union, a leading thinktank has warned. Open Europe, which took a neutral stance on the referendum, said Britain could risk losing its status as a hub for financial services unless passporting rights are made the top priority in negotiations with the EU. The warning came as the Financial Times reported that the government is considering proposals [paywall] that would see billions of pounds paid into the EU budget in exchange for giving the financial sector continued access to the single market. The report\u2019s authors also warned that failure to help UK-based banks could have repercussions on the continent, because banks would not necessarily move their business from Britain to mainland Europe, and could opt for New York or Singapore. The thinktank, whose co-director Raoul Ruparel recently joined David Davis\u2019s Brexit advisory team, said the government should aim to offer the industry maximum certainty as early on as possible. \u201cBased on our background conversations, if banks, for instance, were still unclear about what the future holds one year before the UK formally exits the EU, they would be forced to start making decisions \u2013 including over whether to shift part of their business elsewhere,\u201d the report said. \u201cSome firms may well start implementing their contingency plans even earlier than that.\u201d Vincenzo Scarpetta, Open Europe\u2019s senior policy analyst, said firms were preparing for the worst. \u201cThere are plans in case the UK were to leave the single market without any kind of regulatory equivalence,\u201d he said. \u201cThese plans may be set into motion early on if the uncertainty drags on for too long.\u201d Around a fifth of the banking sector\u2019s annual revenue is estimated to be tied to the passport, though other sectors such as insurance and asset management would be less affected because different EU rules apply. Scarpetta said UK negotiators had to make it clear that EU countries would not necessarily benefit from a London exodus. \u201cNon-EU financial centres are just as well placed to reap the benefits, and if this happens we are in a lose-lose situation,\u201d he said. \u201cThe UK\u2019s financial services sector employs 1.9m people. Frankfurt is often cited as an alternative destination, but the whole city of Frankfurt has 725,000 inhabitants. We are hearing a lot of talk about Paris preparing the red carpet, or Dublin, but it is not a zero-sum game.\u201d In a speech on Monday, Nick Clegg will echo calls from the City for a transitional deal to be put in place after the end of the Article 50 process if the UK does not retain single market membership, warning food prices will see a steep hike if the UK reverts to World Trade Organisation tariffs, including on imported beef, cheese and wine. Clegg will warn that the under WTO rules, tariffs will also have to be applied to all imports into the UK until a trade deal with the EU is struck. In his third Brexit Challenge report, the former deputy prime minister will say UK farming will be particularly badly hit by tariffs, including 47% on milk, 40% on cheese, 59% on beef, and 40% on lamb. An attempt has been made by a powerful cross-party group of MPs to force a parliamentary vote on whether the government should reveal its plans for the UK\u2019s future outside the EU before negotiations begin, a campaign which was likened to showing your hand in poker by one cabinet minister. \u201cIf I were to sit down and play poker with you this morning, I\u2019m not going to show you my cards before we even start playing the game,\u201d the international development secretary, Priti Patel, told BBC1\u2019s Andrew Marr Show. A new poll, commissioned by the Open Britain campaign, shows that nearly three-quarters of the public thinks the government should seek parliamentary approval for their Brexit plans before Article 50 is triggered and the negotiations start. Leave voters amongst those polled also backed the move by 49% to 33% and Ukip voters were the most enthusiastic, backing the move by 62% to 20%.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The role of the weak pound in pushing up prices for UK shoppers and motorists will become clearer this week, with official figures expected to show a sharp rise in inflation. One leading economic forecaster is warning that rising costs will continue to hit consumer spending next year and in 2018, as a decline in business investment after the Brexit vote applies further downward pressure to economic growth. Inflation is forecast to have hit its highest level since late 2014, when measured on the consumer prices index (CPI). Economists forecast the rate will have jumped to 0.9% in September from 0.6% in August when the data is published on Tuesday, according to a Reuters poll. Sterling\u2019s plunge against other currencies since June\u2019s vote to leave the EU has raised the cost of imports to the UK and last week sparked a pricing row between Marmite maker Unilever and supermarket Tesco. Experts say currency moves will take time to trickle down to the prices consumers pay at the tills but they expect some early effects to be seen in September\u2019s inflation figures. \u201cCPI inflation should jump up in September, and looks set to rise quickly over the coming months,\u201d said the consultancy Capital Economics in a note to clients predicting a 1% inflation reading for September. \u201cA rise in September looks inevitable. The drop in sterling and rise in dollar oil prices has seen fuel prices at the pumps rise by over 1% in September.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s more, we expect inflation to pick up further next year, to over 2% by spring as the effects of the drop in the exchange rate work its way through the inflation pipeline.\u201d The EY Item Club, a forecasting group that uses Treasury modelling, expects the UK economy to grow 1.9% this year, fuelled by a 2.5% rise in consumer spending on the back of low inflation. However, this performance is expected to fizzle out, as inflation jumps to 2.6% next year and 1.8% in 2018, causing consumer spending to slump to 0.5% and 0.9% respectively. Alan Clarke, economist at Scotiabank in London, is predicting inflation will rise to 0.8% in September as an increase in fuel prices overshadows the impact of cheaper food. He expects that downward effect from food prices to fade once supermarkets stop cutting prices. \u201cLast week\u2019s Tesco versus Unilever standoff highlighted that the end of the supermarket price war may be close,\u201d he added. Economists at Daiwa Capital Markets highlighted the likely effect of a weaker pound, which recently touched new 31-year lows against the US dollar. \u201cThe data are \u2026 expected to suggest that the sharp depreciation in sterling following the referendum has already started to push prices up,\u201d they wrote in a research note. The prospect of rising inflation spooked financial markets last week and investors offloaded UK government bonds, known as gilts. At the close of another tumultuous week on markets, 10-year gilt yields, which move inversely to prices, rose to their highest levels since the referendum in June. The pound remained under pressure against the dollar and the euro, falling to below $1.22 and \u20ac1.11. That compares with $1.49 and \u20ac1.31 the night of the vote on EU membership. The key pressure on sterling over the last fortnight has come from worries that the government has set a course for a hard Brexit settlement that leaves the UK shut out of the European single market. Ministers have hinted they would sacrifice that access in return for stricter immigration controls. Such signals from Theresa May\u2019s government had \u201cshattered\u201d a relatively benign market view of Brexit, said economists Robert Wood and Gilles Moec at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Referring to the mood over the summer, they wrote in a research note: \u201cWe often heard the argument that Brexit risks were overblown, that article 50 might never be triggered, or that even if it was, Brexit would never really happen.\u201d Now, however, May\u2019s commitment to trigger article 50 by the end of next March, launching the formal process of leaving the EU, meant Brexit was \u201cgetting real faster than markets expected, and getting real in a potentially negative way: a \u2018hard Brexit\u2019 looks more likely in our view,\u201d Wood and Moec added. The falling pound, inflationary pressures and blow to businesses\u2019 investment plans from the Brexit vote leave the Bank of England with a difficult balancing act. Policymakers cut interest rates to a record low of 0.25% in August and hinted at another cut to follow before the end of the year. But after reports suggesting consumers and businesses have shrugged off the initial shock of the Brexit vote, that further reduction is in doubt. \u201cUntil the last couple of weeks, the monetary policy outlook had appeared clear cut, with the monetary policy committee giving a strong steer that it intended to loosen policy again before the end of the year. But since then the enduring strength of the incoming data and the further sharp depreciation of the pound have thrown a couple of spanners into the works,\u201d said Andrew Goodwin at the consultancy Oxford Economics.",

      "bodyText": "A wave of speculative bets on company share price falls could sweep through the London stock market if recent rises in inflation push up borrowing costs, according to a veteran short-seller. Simon Cawkwell, 70, is reputed to have made several fortunes placing financial bets against the shares in companies ranging from Maxwell Communications Corporation and Polly Peck in the early 1990s through to Northern Rock in 2007. Along the way, there have been big losses too. But Cawkwell, who writes frequently under his nom de plume Evil Knievil, remains one of a shrinking band of incorrigible market gossips willing to pit their wits against large investment institutions and hedge funds that now dominate the London stock market. The latest signs of rising inflation, Cawkwell argues, could soon trigger a different mood among investors. Some companies, he suggests, will be rapidly found out as short-sellers move in to target shares that are overvalued. Cawkwell warns of a \u201cweight of cash\u201d that has been encouraged \u2013 by ultra-low interest rates and quantitative easing \u2013 into buying shares since the 2008 financial crisis. \u201cWhen the weight of the public\u2019s money is there [invested in shares], or ready to have a go, it is difficult to go short.\u201d And until the mood in the market reacts to inflation, he concedes, \u201ca much safer trade would be to slap it all on Almanzor at Ascot on Saturday\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Tesco workers are taking legal action against their employer on grounds of age and gender discrimination after the supermarket cut its pay rates for night and weekend shifts. A group of 17 long-serving employees, who joined Tesco before 1999, are fighting the cut in wages introduced in July this year. Lawyers believe up to 38,000 staff who are paid by the hour could be affected. Tesco announced the changes in February and they had been agreed in consultation with the shopworkers\u2019 trade union, Usdaw, and staff representatives. The company said an accompanying 3.1% pay rise to \u00a37.62 per hour made it one of the highest payers in the retail industry. But staff who used to receive double time for Sunday or bank holiday shifts saw their pay slashed to time and a half. Leigh Day, the legal firm acting for the claimants, has written to Tesco asking them how many of Tesco\u2019s staff who are paid by the hour \u2013 who are mostly over 40 years old \u2013 are affected. All staff taken on before 5 July 1999 have seen their benefits reduced. Paula Lee, of Leigh Day\u2019s employment and discrimination department, said: \u201cThe decision to impose pay cuts on long-serving employees is a bitter pill for our clients to swallow and we believe it is discriminatory. There seems to be a growing trend amongst retailers to cut staff wages and use those savings across other areas of the business. \u201cIt is the longer-serving staff in these retail organisations who usually suffer. Understandably our clients feel their loyalty is being taken advantage of; that the employer knows they are unlikely to leave their jobs and, in turn, that makes them feel vulnerable to further \u2018no choice\u2019 pay cuts.\u201d A spokesperson for Tesco said: \u201cEarlier this year we announced a pay increase of up to 3.1% for colleagues working in our stores across the UK, in addition to a 5% turnaround bonus. As part of the pay negotiations we also agreed to simplify premium payments to ensure a fair and consistent approach for all colleagues. The minority of colleagues who were negatively impacted by this change were supported with an agreed lump sum transition payment.\u201d The transition payment was equivalent to the loss in pay over the next 18 months. Tesco did not confirm how many workers were affected but said it was a small number. A similar dispute is simmering at Marks &amp; Spencer, which reduced the earnings of about 10% of its shop-floor workers by cutting premium payments for those working antisocial hours in July. Leigh Day said it is also representing thousands of employees in discrimination claims against Asda and Sainsbury\u2019s.",

      "bodyText": "The resignation last week of the chief executive of Wells Fargo should have been a high point for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). The CFPB announced in early September that it would receive the lion\u2019s share of a $185m fine levied on Wells Fargo as punishment for encouraging employees to open millions of savings and credit accounts for customers without their knowledge or consent. The rest went to Los Angeles regulators and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Then came congressional hearings, at which Stumpf \u2013 one of those rare individuals whom Democrats and Republicans could agree was a villain \u2013 embarrassed himself by fumbling the questions and passing the buck up to his board of directors and down to the rank-and-file employees who actually opened the accounts. Nor was that the only highlight for the CFPB of late. The agency has issued new rules governing prepaid cards, an alternative to checking accounts used by large numbers of \u201cunbanked\u201d Americans who can\u2019t afford the rising fees traditional banks levy on checking accounts, or for whom banks decline to open accounts. As the wealth gap has widened, the prepaid industry has soared, from being worth $1bn in 2003 to $65bn by 2012. Users tend to be among the more vulnerable members of society: making less than $50,000, renters rather than homeowners, minorities and women, according to research by the Pew Charitable Trusts. In other words, they tend to be vulnerable to abuse or simple misunderstanding. The CPFB\u2019s new rules will require clear disclosure about what fees the card issuer will charge to check a balance, for instance, and ensure that losses will be limited to what a conventional debit card holder would face if their card was lost or stolen. So far, so good for the CPFB. A US appeals court, however, rained on the agency\u2019s parade, while members of Congress and others raised questions about whether the CFPB has embarked on some kind of power trip. The court was considering an appeal in a case involving whether the CFPB had the right to impose a $103m fine on mortgage service PHH, for allegedly taking kickbacks for directing customers to a particular insurance company. The case reached the US court of appeals for the District of Columbia, where a three-judge panel headed by Brett Kavanaugh, a George W Bush appointee, handed down its ruling last Tuesday. \u201cUnconstitutional\u201d, Kavanaugh thundered. Not the CFPB itself, but its structure, which is headed by a single individual, Richard Cordray, who serves for a fixed term. Typically, heads of such agencies serve either at the president\u2019s pleasure or as part of a group, such as the five-member Securities and Exchange Commission. So much for the brief, fleeting moment of bipartisanship as Democrats and Republicans joined in bashing Stumpf. If you believe Republicans, the CFPB \u2013 part of the Dodd-Frank reforms that followed the financial crisis of 2008 \u2013 is, in the words of Kavanaugh, a \u201cgrave threat to individual liberty\u201d, a phrase he used once every three pages or so in his 98-page decision. Investor\u2019s Business Daily agrees. The CFPB is an \u201cout-of-control\u201d and \u201cdangerous\u201d entity, it wrote \u2013 \u201cthe Frankenstein\u2019s Monster of federal regulatory agencies\u201d that is \u201calmost entirely unaccountable to the public\u201d. Translation: the CFPB\u2019s critics want to shut the agency down lest it become even more effective, and are taking a weird and sometimes mutually contradictory variety of approaches to doing so. When the CFPB has been slower than it might have been to act, as in the case of Wells Fargo, Republicans have taken delight in accusing it of being \u201casleep at the switch\u201d, in the words of Texas representative Jeb Hensarling, the CFPB\u2019s chief critic in the House. When the CFPB has been proactive in its core areas \u2013 mortgage lending, credit cards and student loans \u2013 this has also attracted criticism. For instance, while its mission didn\u2019t include looking at for-profit colleges, the agency\u2019s emphasis on student loans led it realize that a disproportionate number of problems were tied to entities such as Corinthian colleges and ITT Technical Institute, which took advantage of the student loan system while at the same time misrepresenting graduation rates. It sued both schools for predatory lending, prompting their collapses. Still, in at least one case, a federal judge (another George W Bush appointee) denied the agency access to information about how an accreditor signed off on programs offered by these colleges. \u201cAlthough it is understandable that new agencies like the CFPB will struggle to establish the exact parameters of their authority, they must be especially prudent before choosing to plow headlong into fields not clearly ceded to them by Congress,\u201d tsk-tsked US district judge Richard J Leon. Last week\u2019s ruling could have been a lot worse, and Hensarling is probably gnashing his teeth in fury, wishing that the DC court had gone further. Cordray will now serve at the president\u2019s pleasure, rather than for a fixed five-year term \u2013 unless the agency appeals and the decision is overturned. This isn\u2019t impossible: it\u2019s hard to argue how the presence of a single individual at the helm of an agency offers a threat to liberty, unless the agency under that individual restricted the ability of those it regulated to access the court system to complain about its judgments. The fact that PHH did precisely that in this instance is evidence that there\u2019s no tyranny at work. What Hensarling and his buddies are really irate about is that the CFPB gets its funding independently \u2013 that\u2019s the lack of accountability that Investor\u2019s Business Daily was getting huffy about. In other words, it\u2019s not politicized: the CFPB doesn\u2019t have to grovel to Congress annually to keep its budget. The agency has reason to be concerned. Even as Dodd-Frank expanded the list of SEC responsibilities, Congress, perhaps under pressure from the financial services industry, actually cut the amount of money it had to work with. The SEC\u2019s 2017 budget will be unchanged, it now seems. But yet again, that entity only narrowly escaped a cut. In contrast, the CFPB is financially independent of Congress, being funded directly by the Federal Reserve (and collecting its fines, as other agencies do) and that drives Hensarling and other opponents crazy. They may characterize that as being \u201cunaccountable\u201d to ordinary Americans, but I think it actually enables the agency to listen to ordinary Americans rather than to the Very Loud Voices of the lobbyists who have a disproportionate impact on Congress. So far, at least the CFPB doesn\u2019t seem to be using any \u201csuperpowers\u201d it might have to threaten my life, liberty or pursuit of happiness.",

      "bodyText": "It has been just like old times. The pound has been falling on the foreign exchanges and, like a patient in intensive care, there are daily bulletins about its health. Charts show that when adjusted for different patterns of trade down the ages it is at its lowest for 168 years. If you have been gouged by a foreign exchange desk at Heathrow airport, this is a bad thing. If you consider sterling to be a symbol of national virility, it is a bad thing. If you think that the future for the UK outside the European Union is unremittingly bleak, it is definitely a very bad thing. But put the Brexit vote to one side for a second and ask yourself the following questions: is the economy currently unbalanced? Is growth too dependent on consumer spending and asset price bubbles? Is the productive base of the economy too small? Is it a problem that the UK is running a balance of payments deficit worth 6% of GDP, bigger than ever before in peacetime? If your answer to these four questions is yes \u2013 as it should be \u2013 then you need to accept that there is an upside to the falling pound. Indeed, many of those who are now talking about a sterling crisis were last year bemoaning the fact that Greece \u2013 trapped as it was inside the eurozone \u2013 did not have the benefit of a floating currency and so had to use a brutal internal devaluation involving wage cuts, pension reductions and welfare retrenchment to restore its competitiveness. There have been four big movements in the pound in the past 25 years: a big decline after Black Wednesday in 1992, a gradual but sustained increase in the late 1990s and early 2000s, a sharp fall during the financial crash and subsequent recession of 2007-09, and the drop since 23 June. A good argument could be made for the rise in the late 1990s and early 2000s being the most damaging of the lot. This was the currency movement that hollowed out a large chunk of manufacturing, costing 1 million jobs. This was the period when the strength of the pound attracted hot money flows into London, increasing the size and power of the financial sector. These years saw the widening of the current account deficit and the tendency for consumers to extract spending power from the rising value of their homes. The depreciation that followed Black Wednesday was more successful than that in the late 2000s. With the global economy booming, the 15% drop in the value of the pound after Britain came out of the exchange rate mechanism in September 1992 boosted exports. By the time Labour came to power in 1997, the balance of payments \u2013 a combination of trade, overseas payments and investment flows \u2013 was the closest it has been to balancing since the UK last ran a surplus in 1984. Three factors limited the ability of the UK to take advantage of the 2007-09 depreciation: the loss of manufacturing capacity; the weakness of global demand; and the growing reliance on exports from the City, which were particularly hard hit during a period when the financial markets froze. There was an improvement in the current account balance from -3.5% to -1.8% of national output but the picture deteriorated rapidly once the economy started to grow again. This was hardly surprising. The eurozone was going through an existential crisis at a time when George Osborne was pumping up the housing market through the funding for lending scheme and help to buy. A rising pound and weak demand meant exports struggled and manufacturing output flatlined. A traditional British recovery dominated by a rising property market delivered the traditional British result: a whopping balance of payments deficit. Had the result in the referendum gone the other way, the deficit would have got bigger. Sterling would have risen on the foreign exchanges, making imports cheaper and exports dearer. The economy has held up pretty well since late June but would have grown faster had remain won. It would have been business as usual and by now there would have been pressure on the Bank of England to raise interest rates to prevent the economy overheating. Britain has discovered a way of living beyond its means. Assets are sold to overseas buyers bringing capital into the country to offset the balance of payments deficit. It is the equivalent of a once well-to-do household that has fallen on hard times pawning the silver to keep up appearances. At some point, referendum or no referendum, the financial markets were going to say enough is enough and it is delusional to think otherwise. Running permanent balance of payment deficits amounts to borrowing growth from the future. Sooner or later, it has to be paid back and Brexit means it will be sooner. A weaker pound works by making exports cheaper and imports dearer. The effect, as after all the other devaluations and depreciations of the past 100 years \u2013 1931, 1949, 1967, 1976, 1992 and 2007 \u2013 will make the economy less dependent on consumers and more reliant on producers. Lord Mervyn King, a former governor of the Bank of England, thinks the latest fall in sterling is a good thing and he is right. There have been suggestions from some in the remain camp that the hollowing out of manufacturing will make it impossible to gain any benefit from the cheaper pound. This, frankly, is nonsense. The current account deficit will shrink as a result of stronger exports from the manufacturing and service sectors, the boost provided to the tourism industry, and because cheaper domestic goods and services will be substituted for more expensive imports. To say that dearer imports will make life more difficult for consumers is to miss the point. That\u2019s how rebalancing works. Will dearer food and the coming squeeze on living standards will prompt a change of heart about Brexit? Remainers should not bank on it. Life has not been great for many in recent years anyway. What\u2019s more, Britain is a country with a streak of cussedness that delights in having its back to the wall. That said, there is a lot of guff talked by some in the leave camp about how being unshackled from the EU will enable Britain to break into markets that have hitherto been closed. The notion that Britain has been prevented from exporting to China, India or any other part of the world by Brussels red tape is disproved by one seven-letter word: Germany. Profound economic change is usually the result of a convulsive shock, of which Brexit is clearly one. The referendum should lead to a period of national introspection and a willingness to address the fundamental vulnerabilities of the economy. If it doesn\u2019t, the opportunity to set sail from fantasy island will be lost.",

Indeed, many of those who are now talking about a sterling crisis were last year bemoaning the fact that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/debt-crisis\">Greece </a>\u2013 trapped as it was inside the eurozone \u2013 did not have the benefit of a floating currency and so had to use a brutal internal devaluation involving wage cuts, pension reductions and welfare retrenchment to restore its competitiveness.</p> <p>There have been four big movements in the pound in the past 25 years: a big decline after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/sep/13/black-wednesday-20-years-pound-erm\">Black Wednesday in 1992</a>, a gradual but sustained increase in the late 1990s and early 2000s, a sharp fall during the financial crash and subsequent recession of 2007-09, and the drop <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/11/pound-completes-worst-four-day-performance-since-brexit-vote\">since 23 June</a>.</p> <p>A good argument could be made for the rise in the late 1990s and early 2000s being the most damaging of the lot. This was the currency movement that hollowed out a large chunk of manufacturing, costing 1 million jobs. This was the period when the strength of the pound attracted hot money flows into London, increasing the size and power of the financial sector. These years saw the widening of the current account deficit and the tendency for consumers to extract spending power from the rising value of their homes.<br></p> <p>The depreciation that followed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/sep/13/black-wednesday-bad-day-conservatives\">Black Wednesday</a> was more successful than that in the late 2000s. With the global economy booming, the 15% drop in the value of the pound after Britain came out of the exchange rate mechanism in September 1992 boosted exports. By the time Labour came to power in 1997, the balance of payments \u2013 a combination of trade, overseas payments and investment flows \u2013 was the closest it has been to balancing since the UK last ran a surplus in 1984.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"146a3fd473ecafa151f987828bd30bef01fb4271\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/146a3fd473ecafa151f987828bd30bef01fb4271/0_0_499_558/447.jpg\" alt=\"Pound V Dollar graph\" width=\"447\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Three factors limited the ability of the UK to take advantage of the 2007-09 depreciation: the loss of manufacturing capacity; the weakness of global demand; and the growing reliance on exports from the City, which were particularly hard hit during a period when the financial markets froze. There was an improvement in the current account balance from -3.5% to -1.8% of national output but the picture deteriorated rapidly once the economy started to grow again.<br></p> <p>This was hardly surprising. The eurozone was going through an existential crisis at a time when George Osborne was pumping up the housing market through the funding for lending scheme and help to buy. A rising pound and weak demand meant exports struggled and manufacturing output flatlined. A traditional British recovery dominated by a rising property market delivered the traditional British result: a whopping balance of payments deficit.</p> <p>Had the result in the referendum gone the other way, the deficit would have got bigger. Sterling would have risen on the foreign exchanges, making imports cheaper and exports dearer. The economy has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/21/post-referendum-gloom-fears-confounded-economic-evidence\">held up pretty well since late June</a> but would have grown faster had remain won. It would have been business as usual and by now there would have been pressure on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/04/bank-of-england-cuts-uk-interest-rates\">Bank of England </a>to raise interest rates to prevent the economy overheating.</p> <p>Britain has discovered a way of living beyond its means. Assets are sold to overseas buyers bringing capital into the country to offset the balance of payments deficit. It is the equivalent of a once well-to-do household that has fallen on hard times pawning the silver to keep up appearances. At some point, referendum or no referendum, the financial markets were going to say enough is enough and it is delusional to think otherwise.<br></p> <p>Running permanent balance of payment deficits amounts to borrowing growth from the future. Sooner or later, it has to be paid back and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">Brexit </a>means it will be sooner. A weaker pound works by making exports cheaper and imports dearer. The effect, as after all the other devaluations and depreciations of the past 100 years \u2013 1931, 1949, 1967, 1976, 1992 and 2007 \u2013 will make the economy less dependent on consumers and more reliant on producers. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/10/fall-in-sterling-is-a-welcome-change-says-mervyn-king-brexit-vote\">Lord Mervyn King</a>, a former governor of the Bank of England, thinks the latest fall in sterling is a good thing and he is right.<br></p> <p>There have been suggestions from some in the remain camp that the hollowing out of manufacturing will make it impossible to gain any benefit from the cheaper pound. This, frankly, is nonsense. The current account deficit will shrink as a result of stronger exports from the manufacturing and service sectors, the boost provided to the tourism industry, and because cheaper domestic goods and services will be substituted for more expensive imports. To say that dearer imports will make life more difficult for consumers is to miss the point. That\u2019s how rebalancing works.</p> <p>Will dearer food and the coming squeeze on living standards will prompt a change of heart about Brexit? Remainers should not bank on it. Life has not been great for many in recent years anyway. What\u2019s more, Britain is a country with a streak of cussedness that delights in having its back to the wall. <br></p> <p>That said, there is a lot of guff talked by some in the leave camp about how being unshackled from the EU will enable Britain to break into markets that have hitherto been closed. The notion that Britain has been prevented from exporting to China, India or any other part of the world by Brussels red tape is disproved by one seven-letter word: Germany.</p> <p>Profound economic change is usually the result of a convulsive shock, of which Brexit is clearly one. The referendum should lead to a period of national introspection and a willingness to address the fundamental vulnerabilities of the economy. If it doesn\u2019t, the opportunity to set sail from fantasy island will be lost.<br></p>",

Following the scary clown appearances that shocked people around the globe, the burger chain has decided to cut back on public appearances of its pasty-faced mascot. That is not the only bad news for McDonald\u2019s, which reports third-quarter figures on Friday. According to the Wall Street Journal, an internal memo shows that only one in five millennials has ever tried a Big Mac. No wonder the company is trying so hard to reinvent itself. It is now 18 months into a transformation plan led by British-born chief executive Steve Easterbrook, which includes offering all-day breakfasts, improving the quality of the food on offer, and selling thousands of its restaurants to franchisees. Last week it said it would be making $130m of restructuring charges in this latest quarter and would increase the number of restaurants sold to franchisees from 3,500 to 4,000, out of a total of 36,000. In July, McDonald\u2019s reported a 4% fall in second-quarter revenues amid growing consumer uncertainty.

Bailey decision should check Burberry\u2019s slide With Burberry planning to end its experiment with creative director Christopher Bailey also acting as chief executive, the luxury goods group could be back on the road to recovery. In the summer, the company announced that Bailey would move back to his creative role, and that Marco Gobbetti, the man behind LVMH\u2019s C\u00e9line brand, would take over as chief executive some time in 2017. During his tenure Bailey was unfortunate to face a slowdown in demand for luxury goods, particularly in China and Hong Kong. But since the summer things have picked up, helped by the slump in the pound \u2013 which is boosting its overseas profits as well as tempting more tourists to visit London and snap up its trademark beige check. Recent positive comments from LVMH on trading in Hong Kong also bode well for Burberry, which releases its latest update on Tuesday. Despite the delay in Gobbetti starting, analysts at Berenberg said: \u201cThe recently revamped management team should provide the necessary talent and focus to steer it in the right direction.

But mining group BHP Billiton has achieved that distinction before its annual meeting on Thursday. Corporate governance advisor Pirc praised the company for not paying chief executive Andrew Mackenzie anything under its various incentive schemes last year, cutting his bonus to zero following the dam disaster at the Samarco mine in Brazil in 2015 and the decline in commodity markets that has undermined the whole sector. Pirc said: \u201cThis is a welcome use of the remuneration committee\u2019s discretion. Furthermore, the ratio of chief executive to average employee pay is considered acceptable.\u201d But before BHP could get too carried away, Pirc criticised plans to give Mackenzie up to 200% of his salary under further incentive schemes, \u201cwhich is considered excessive\u201d. It added: \u201cPerformance targets for short-term incentives are not disclosed, making it impossible for shareholders to judge if the targets are challenging.\u201d It said proposed long-term incentive plans were not \u201can effective means of incentivising performance \u2026 not properly long-term and are subject to manipulation due to their discretionary nature\u201d.",
