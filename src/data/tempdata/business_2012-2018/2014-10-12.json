      "bodyText": "A veteran businessman and well-known in the BBC\u2019s The Apprentice series \u2013 which returns this week \u2013 has launched an attack on the troubled retailing giant Tesco, warning that it is \u201crunning on empty\u201d after losing the goodwill of both customers and suppliers. Nick Hewer, who has been scrutinising UK supermarkets\u2019 supply chains through his work with the Fairtrade Foundation on bananas, said British shoppers were \u201cfair people\u201d who resented supermarkets apparently squeezing their suppliers or \u201cbarging\u201d into towns where they were not wanted. Hewer, also host of Channel 4\u2019s Countdown TV programme and a fan of farming, is backing the Fairtrade Foundation\u2019s campaign to get all supermarkets to sell 100% Fairtrade bananas and to give shoppers more transparent pricing. It wants the government to intervene in a banana price war in supermarkets that is putting pressure on suppliers and could lead to shortages. A petition to business secretary Vince Cable has attracted 70,000 signatures. The foundation, which aims to protect farmers in developing countries, says the price of bananas in UK supermarkets has nearly halved in the past 10 years to just 11p while farmers have seen production costs double. At a London conference on Wednesday to mark the 20th anniversary of the Fairtrade label, Hewer will hail the economic support given by Fairtrade to overseas farmers, following his recent visit to banana producers in St Lucia, one of the Windward Islands. He will highlight that fact that three UK retailers \u2013 Sainsbury\u2019s, Waitrose and the Co-operative \u2013 already stock 100% Fairtrade and urge others including Tesco \u2013 the UK\u2019s largest banana retailer with nearly 30% of the market \u2013 to follow suit. Hewer told the Guardian ahead of the event: \u201cI think that Tesco\u2019s failure \u2013 no matter what they say \u2013 to engender any sort of loyalty among its suppliers or affection amongst its consumers will now hurt them. Waitrose has over the years built a reservoir of goodwill but Tesco is running on empty.\u201d Acknowledging the competition of discounters such as Aldi and Lidl, Hewer went on: \u201cI know that all the supermarkets are hurting in the face of the price cutters but I think the reservoir of goodwill that people like the Co-op and Waitrose and Sainbury\u2019s [have] will stand them in good stead.\u201d One in three bananas sold in the UK is Fairtrade and if all the supermarkets went 100% that would be a major step forward.\u201d His intervention comes as Tesco\u2019s chief executive Dave Lewis is battling to revive the retailer\u2019s sales and also restore calm after the recent discovery of a \u00a3250m accounting black hole relating to the possible misreporting of payments for suppliers. Last week the retailer ditched plans to build a huge superstore on Margate\u2019s seafront in the latest sign of its retreat from aggressive expansion. Responding to Hewer\u2019s criticism of the chain\u2019s relationships with supplier and customers, a Tesco spokesperson said: \u201cWe have positive long-term relationships with our suppliers. More than 1,500 of our suppliers have worked closely with us for five years or more, and we are proud to work with them to deliver the best quality products for our customers.\u201d He went on: \u201cWe are strong supporters of Fairtrade and are one of the biggest Fairtrade retailers in the UK. But \u2013 as the Fairtrade Foundation itself recognises \u2013 what matters are the sourcing practices, not the label. We have direct relationships with our banana farmers and pay them on average 6% above the Fairtrade Minimum Price. We are also unique in having in-house local technical and ethical experts based in banana growing regions, who work directly with farmers to improve conditions.\u201d The Fairtrade mark first appeared in the UK in 1994 on just three products. But 20 years on, UK shoppers can choose from over 4,500 Fairtrade products including tea, coffee, cocoa, chocolate, bananas, sugar, cotton, gold, cut flowers, wine and cosmetics.",

    "webTitle": "US hedge fund Elliott Advisors pays unnamed London executive \u00a338m", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The US hedge fund that forced Argentina to default on its debts has paid one of its London-based bosses more than \u00a338m \u2013 a sum 1,437 times greater than the average UK salary of \u00a326,500. Elliott Advisors, the British arm of New York hedge fund Elliott Management, paid \u00a338,119,707 last year to a senior executive in its UK office, according to accounts filed at Companies House. The firm, set up by US billionaire Paul Elliott Singer in 1977, did not identify which of its London directors collected the multimillion-pound pay cheque, though all the possible candidates are American. The director\u2019s pay was up 1,311% on the \u00a32.7m paid out the previous year. Elliott\u2019s UK directors are Keith Horn, 56, chief operating officer, Jonathan Pollock, 51, chief trading officer, and Singer\u2019s son Gordon, 40. PHA Media, the PR firm which represents Elliott, refused to state which director collected the cash. Pollock reportedly lives in one of the largest single floor apartments in Manhatten. He merged three apartments on the ninth floor of the famous Upper West Apthorp building to create a 8,500 sq ft apartment. The \u00a338m pay cheque works out at \u00a3733,000 a week \u2013 or more than twice as much has Wayne Rooney collects from Manchester United. It is thought to be the highest pay earned in Britain this year, ahead of \u00a334m paid to rival fund manager Stephen Butt co-founder of Silchester International last year. Elliott has attracted controversy for its very aggressive pursuit of debts owed by Argentina and other struggling economies. At one point, Elliott won a court order to have a 100 metre Argentine naval vessel seized in Ghana as part of its attempt to collect on bonds on which Buenos Aires defaulted in 2001. Unlike more than 90% of the other Argentina bondholders, Elliott refused to restructure the debt it held, and argued that the country could not legally favour bondholders who had restructured their debt over his group. Singer won the court battle, resulting in the south American country defaulting this summer, leaving holders of the restructured debt without hundreds of millions in interest payments. Argentina\u2019s former foreign minister H\u00e9ctor Timerman has branded Singer \u201cthe inventor of vulture funds\u201d. The fund has also fought long legal battles against Peru and Congo-Brazzaville to collect on old debts at vastly increased values. Elliott\u2019s UK division paid only \u00a31.3m in corporate tax last year, less than the average \u00a31.35m paid to its 53 employees. The firm, which is based on King Street, next to St James\u2019s Square, paid out \u00a372m in salaries, up from \u00a330m last year, as its turnover doubled to \u00a3103m. Among the staff, according to his LinkedIn profile, is Benjamin Tansey, a former president of the Oxford Union who was twice caught wrestling naked on his college\u2019s croquet lawn. Elliott has also attracted controversy for its activist investor campaigns against a string of British companies, including National Express, which it unsuccessfully tried to break up, and Morrisons, which it told to spin off its property holdings. Last month Elliott made \u00a358.5m selling shares in video games retailer Game Digital. It was also involved in the demise of electrical retailer Comet. \u2022 This article was amended on 14 October 2014. An earlier version said \u201cPhil Hall, the former News of the World editor-turned-PR man who represents Elliott, refused to state which director collected the cash\u201d. This has been corrected.",

Followed by the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limited_Liability_Act_1855\" title=\"\">Limited Liability Act of 1855</a>, it established that the fiduciary duty of a director is to act in good faith for the benefit of the company as a whole, ie all shareholders. In practice, this means that what is referred to as the shareholder primacy norm obliges companies to maximise their profits without regard to other considerations. So claims by companies that they are driven by values enshrined in concepts of corporate social responsibility or fair trade should be seen for what they are \u2013 public relations exercises designed to attract custom that will ultimately enhance their bottom line.</p> <p>Even the Tories\u2019 favourite economist, Adam Smith, denounced the size, nature and privileges associated with corporations, and we should heed what he said. Nothing less than a dismantling and revision of the legal framework underpinning private enterprise will serve to alleviate the exploitation, abuses and environmental degradation that it brings but, as Mr Monbiot says, the political class and our so-called democracy is part of the problem rather than the solution. And if charities are too frightened or compromised to challenge this iniquitous system, it falls to other popular organisations like trade unions to oppose its worst manifestations such as the proposed Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, a deal that would give the transnational corporations unprecedented power to run the global economy for the further enrichment of their institutional shareholders at our expense.<br><strong>Bert Schouwenburg</strong><br><em>International officer, GMB</em></p> <p>\u2022 George Monbiot is depressingly correct, but why is he surprised by the pro-business reassurances of certain charities such as Oxfam? Oxfam has always openly pushed for economically liberal pro-free-trade policies in the countries it is committed to help. Oxfam, as opposed to smaller charities or more politically aware ones such as War on Want, actually is a big \u201cbusiness\u201d paying very large salaries out of public donations to its top management tier.<br><strong>Fran\u00e7oise Murray</strong><br><em>Liverpool</em></p> <p>\u2022 I found Aditya Chakrabortty\u2019s critique of \u201ccorporate welfare\u201d (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/oct/06/benefits-corporate-welfare-research-public-money-businesses\" title=\"\">Cut benefits? Yes, let\u2019s start with our \u00a385bn corporate welfare handout</a>, 7 October) illuminating; \u00a385bn is a staggering amount of money. However, as with the social benefits arising from social security, so can there be economic benefits from aids to business. For six years I was responsible for an EU scheme of assistance for small and medium-sized businesses that generated additional sales of \u00a324 for every \u00a31 of EU grants. As the business owners signed off on these numbers, I had a 90% confidence factor in them. The issue is to ensure that the scheme provides good-quality outcomes, ie provable sales increases rather than, say, quantity of contacts. For example, too much money is spent on export services to businesses that make no discernible impact on the balance of trade (but export trips to warm climes in winter are very popular). More focused schemes would cut the cost but raise the outcome. We should all regret the award of public money to companies that pay the minimum wage, have zero-hours contracts and don\u2019t pay taxes.<br><strong>Bob Nicholson</strong><br><em>Frodsham, Cheshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 What Aditya Chakrabortty calls \u201ccorporate welfare\u201d is integral to what the US political scientist Philip Bobbitt in 2002 called \u201cthe new market-state\u201d, which is characterised by a state-subsidised public sector that is dominant over a semi-privatised state sector. One consequence of this is that, while politicians may promise more \u201cpublic spending\u201d, eg on the NHS or education, increasing tranches of this go straight into the pockets of private investors, like the egregious Richard Branson and his Virgin Care.<br><strong>Patrick Ainley</strong><br><em>University of Greenwich</em></p> <p>\u2022 Recent articles by Zoe Williams, Larry Elliott, Aditya Chakrabortty and George Monbiot offer an alternative to the corporate lobby-driven policies all three major parties are peddling. These aren\u2019t \u201cbusiness-friendly\u201d policies. They are \u201celite-friendly\u201d policies. It isn\u2019t a \u201cfree market\u201d, it is \u201ca state-endorsed oligarchy\u201d, as Monbiot puts it, returning to the subject of the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership which he so devastating exposed almost a year ago.

      "bodyText": "The influence and control enjoyed by corporations over the body politic (Our bullying corporations are the new enemy within, 8 October) is an inevitable consequence of the 1844 Joint Stock Companies Act, a piece of legislation effectively marking the birth of modern capitalism. Followed by the Limited Liability Act of 1855, it established that the fiduciary duty of a director is to act in good faith for the benefit of the company as a whole, ie all shareholders. In practice, this means that what is referred to as the shareholder primacy norm obliges companies to maximise their profits without regard to other considerations. So claims by companies that they are driven by values enshrined in concepts of corporate social responsibility or fair trade should be seen for what they are \u2013 public relations exercises designed to attract custom that will ultimately enhance their bottom line. Even the Tories\u2019 favourite economist, Adam Smith, denounced the size, nature and privileges associated with corporations, and we should heed what he said. Nothing less than a dismantling and revision of the legal framework underpinning private enterprise will serve to alleviate the exploitation, abuses and environmental degradation that it brings but, as Mr Monbiot says, the political class and our so-called democracy is part of the problem rather than the solution. And if charities are too frightened or compromised to challenge this iniquitous system, it falls to other popular organisations like trade unions to oppose its worst manifestations such as the proposed Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, a deal that would give the transnational corporations unprecedented power to run the global economy for the further enrichment of their institutional shareholders at our expense. Bert Schouwenburg International officer, GMB \u2022 George Monbiot is depressingly correct, but why is he surprised by the pro-business reassurances of certain charities such as Oxfam? Oxfam has always openly pushed for economically liberal pro-free-trade policies in the countries it is committed to help. Oxfam, as opposed to smaller charities or more politically aware ones such as War on Want, actually is a big \u201cbusiness\u201d paying very large salaries out of public donations to its top management tier. Fran\u00e7oise Murray Liverpool \u2022 I found Aditya Chakrabortty\u2019s critique of \u201ccorporate welfare\u201d (Cut benefits? Yes, let\u2019s start with our \u00a385bn corporate welfare handout, 7 October) illuminating; \u00a385bn is a staggering amount of money. However, as with the social benefits arising from social security, so can there be economic benefits from aids to business. For six years I was responsible for an EU scheme of assistance for small and medium-sized businesses that generated additional sales of \u00a324 for every \u00a31 of EU grants. As the business owners signed off on these numbers, I had a 90% confidence factor in them. The issue is to ensure that the scheme provides good-quality outcomes, ie provable sales increases rather than, say, quantity of contacts. For example, too much money is spent on export services to businesses that make no discernible impact on the balance of trade (but export trips to warm climes in winter are very popular). More focused schemes would cut the cost but raise the outcome. We should all regret the award of public money to companies that pay the minimum wage, have zero-hours contracts and don\u2019t pay taxes. Bob Nicholson Frodsham, Cheshire \u2022 What Aditya Chakrabortty calls \u201ccorporate welfare\u201d is integral to what the US political scientist Philip Bobbitt in 2002 called \u201cthe new market-state\u201d, which is characterised by a state-subsidised public sector that is dominant over a semi-privatised state sector. One consequence of this is that, while politicians may promise more \u201cpublic spending\u201d, eg on the NHS or education, increasing tranches of this go straight into the pockets of private investors, like the egregious Richard Branson and his Virgin Care. Patrick Ainley University of Greenwich \u2022 Recent articles by Zoe Williams, Larry Elliott, Aditya Chakrabortty and George Monbiot offer an alternative to the corporate lobby-driven policies all three major parties are peddling. These aren\u2019t \u201cbusiness-friendly\u201d policies. They are \u201celite-friendly\u201d policies. It isn\u2019t a \u201cfree market\u201d, it is \u201ca state-endorsed oligarchy\u201d, as Monbiot puts it, returning to the subject of the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership which he so devastating exposed almost a year ago. If Labour cannot see this then what hope do they think they have to claim to speak as the voice of the 99%? Ignore the Lords Levy and Noon and listen instead to some sane advice from the Guardian. Larry Elliott (Talk is cheap, but tackling inequality requires action, 6 October) wrote that policymakers must be \u201cprepared to redistribute resources from rich to poor\u201d, create \u201can international tax system that prevents revenues being salted away in tax havens\u201d, ensure \u201cthat trade agreements are not written by multinational corporations\u201d, strengthen \u201cwelfare safety nets and the rights of workers\u201d and recognise \u201cthat both the private and the public sectors have a role\u201d.

      "bodyText": "A traumatic childhood experience in the dentist\u2019s chair is blamed by many adults for their dread of having an oral check-up. This perception of the dentist\u2019s surgery as a Victorian setting where pain is a by-product of the experience frustrates Professor Nigel Pitts, a dentist who has developed a technique that could make drills, injections and fillings things of the past in the treatment of tooth decay. Pitts and his colleague Dr Chris Longbottom, from King\u2019s College London, have created a system that will allow teeth with early- to medium-stage damage from dental caries to repair themselves in the time it takes to do a normal filling, without the traditionally invasive techniques. The new method, called electrically accelerated and enhanced remineralisation (EAER), uses low-frequency electrical currents and is set to come to market in three years after three decades of research in the area by the men behind it. \u201cIt is often accepted as norm that you will end up with tooth decay. It is a preventable disease,\u201d said Pitts. Central to the new method is how tooth decay develops. When plaque combines with sugar or refined carbohydrates, acid is produced which attacks the hard tissues of the teeth, pulling minerals \u2013 demineralisation \u2013 from the surface and beneath the surface of the tooth. Countering this are the minerals in saliva along with the calcium and fluoride in toothpastes which remineralise the tooth \u2013 a process which can happen between 15 and 25 times a day. If demineralisation outweighs remineralisation, the hard tissues of the tooth break down and eventually produce holes in the teeth cavities. Research has been taking place since the 1980s to find ways to boost remineralisation. The technology developed by Pitts and Longbottom works in two stages. First the area of the tooth is cleaned, including the inside of the three-dimensional lesion. A tiny electric current then drives minerals into the tooth in a process called iontophoresis. \u201cTraditionally with caries, we have said \u2018you have a sound tooth\u2019 or \u2018you have a hole in it\u2019. We haven\u2019t understood this process \u2013 the continuum of caries, these multiple stages,\u201d said Pitts. \u201cFirstly we recognise that that tooth surface is now [after demineralisation] really complicated and what was the sound tooth is full of proteins, lipids, what you had for lunch. All sorts of debris are sitting in that sponge and then people try to throw on a remineralising solution [toothpaste] and it doesn\u2019t work and they are surprised. It won\u2019t work because the surface, a very complicated three-dimensional porous surface, is contaminated and filled up with all sorts of gunk. \u201cWhat we have done simply is to devise a method that chemically cleans and pulls out all the various elements that have been acquired over time that are blocking up the inside three-dimensional surface of the lesion, take all that away, produce a surface that is chemically clean and ready to remineralise and then we use iontophoresis. \u201cWe turn the inside of the tooth into an electrode so that the mineral is drawn all the way into the depths of the lesion. So we have conditioned the surface. We have a surface which can remineralise. \u201cAnd then we change the electrical fields and drive mineral into the most damaged areas and then rebuild the tooth from inside,\u201d Pitts said. Still in its early stages, it is envisaged that the process will take some 15 minutes using a \u201chealing hand piece\u201d the size of a highlighter pen. This will have small reservoirs of the materials needed to carry out the painless process in an area like a \u201cvery small tea bag\u201d. It could be carried out by a dentist or a hygienist, depending on the local regulations. Pitts said the first device would work where the decay had not developed into a large physical cavity but where the dentist would say that it had gone far enough to necessitate a filling \u2013 the early to moderate stage. Further research was needed before more extensive lesions could be dealt with, he said. He said the treatment would fortify the tooth with a stronger form of the original mineral that would be harder to dissolve in future, although long-term research is needed to demonstrate that. Both cost and time will be comparable to those of a conventional filling, he said, and it was designed to be carried out without the need for a local anaesthetic. \u201cRather than wait until you have a hole and pain and discomfort and we have got to take away too much of the tissue, it is early detection, finding lesions in time. And then \u2013 what we do at the moment is try to arrest those, stop them progressing \u2013 but we will actually be able to stop them and be able to take them back in time. \u201cThat\u2019s why we have been talking about a time warp \u2013 we are taking the lesion back in its time course and rebuilding the health of the mineral in it,\u201d he said. \u201cInstead of having the injection, instead of having the hole cut in your tooth, instead of having a plastic or a metal material put in, you have actually had the tooth dealt with, the demineralisation taken away, natural mineral put back in and the tooth restored to health.\u201d The cost to the dentist of the equipment and materials has not yet been decided but should be cheaper than comparable technology, according to Pitts. A company, Reminova, has been set up to commercialise the technology with Pitts as chairman and Longbottom as chief technology officer and is in discussions with investors. Based in Perth, Scotland, the company is the first to emerge from the King\u2019s College London dental innovation and translation centre, which was set up to take technologies and turn them into new products and practices.",
