      "bodyText": "Economics teaching at Britain's universities has come under fire from a leading academic who accused lecturers of presenting \"things that are known to be untrue\" to preserve theories that claim to show how the economy works. The Treasury is hosting a conference in London on Monday to discuss the crisis in economics teaching, which critics say has remained largely unchanged since the 2008 financial crash despite the failure of many in the profession to spot the looming credit crunch and worst recession for 100 years. Michael Joffe, professor of economics at Imperial College, London, said he was disturbed by the way economics textbooks continued to discuss concepts and models as facts when they were debunked decades ago. He said: \"What if economics was based more on empirical studies and empirical evidence? There are lots of studies and economists are often very good at finding the evidence for how things work, but it does not feed into or challenge what's in the textbooks. \"I asked a textbook author recently why a theory that is known to be wrong is still appearing in his book he said to me that his publisher would expect it to be there.\" Joffe, a former biologist, called for more evidence in economic teaching in the October edition of the Royal Economic Society newsletter. He said many reformers had called for economics courses to embrace the teachings of Marx and Keynes to undermine the dominance of neoclassical free-market theories, but the aim should be to provide students with analysis based on the way the world works, not the way theories argue it ought to work. \"There is a lot that is taught on economics courses that bears little relation to the way things work in the real world,\" he said. The Treasury-hosted conference will debate the state of economics teaching, with leading figures from the profession invited to speak, including Bank of England director Andy Haldane. Sponsored by the Institute for New Economic Thinking (INET), it aims to highlight reforms to address the shortcomings of the core economics curriculum. Headed by economics professor Eric Beinhocker of Oxford University, the INET has grown into a large international lobby group with the aim of reforming mainstream economic teaching in the world's leading colleges. The conference comes only a fortnight after Manchester University economics students criticised orthodox free-market teaching on their course, arguing that alternative ways of thinking have been pushed to the margins. Members of the Post-Crash Economics Society said their course was dominated by models and equations that trained undergraduates for City jobs without a broader understanding of the way economies and businesses work. Joe Earle, a spokesman for the society and a final-year undergraduate, said academic departments were ignoring the crisis in the profession and that, by neglecting global developments and critics of the free market such as Keynes and Marx, the study of economics was \"in danger of losing its broader relevance\". The profession has been criticised for its adherence to models of a free market that claim to show demand and supply continually rebalancing over relatively short periods of time \u2013 in contrast to the decade-long mismatches that came ahead of the banking crash in key markets such as housing and exotic derivatives, where asset bubbles ballooned. Joffe said university economics department were continuing to teach concepts that had been disproved. In one example he said the idea that companies suffer \"dis-economies of scale\" when they increase production beyond certain capacity was true in only a small number of firms. The U-shaped curve shows that unit costs are high when production begins and become cheaper as economies of scale allow a company to spread costs over more units. Units become more expensive to produce after a factory reaches capacity. Joffe said: \"We ought to stop teaching the U shape as the typical relationship between costs and scale, for the simple reason that it is false.\" \u2022 This article was amended on 10 November 2013. The original said that Wendy Carlin heads the Institute for New Economic Thinking (INET) when she chairs the INET's CORE curriculum group. This has been corrected",

      "bodyText": "G4S has launched an internal investigation after a judge referred a number of its employees for prosecution for forgery and contempt of court in a \"truly shocking\" case of what he called disgraceful behaviour. In the high court, Mr Justice Mostyn said three employees from G4S running Brook House immigration removal centre in Gatwick, East Sussex, had been involved in forging a document and contempt of court after giving witness statements during an immigration appeal involving allegations of torture at the hands of a foreign government. In an excoriating judgment which has been referred the attorney general and the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP), Mostyn said G4S employees Tamara Burns, Marilyn Bennett and Matthew Newman were involved in \"corruptly redacting\" an official certificate, an action which helped bolster the case against an immigrant who was being deported from the UK. Last week the Guardian revealed the Home Office is in discussions with G4S to expand Brook House by 30% despite a freeze on new government contracts for the multinational security company while it is investigated by the Serious Fraud Office for allegations of criminally overcharging taxpayers. The asylum seeker, who is not allowed to be named for legal reasons, claimed he had been tortured and beaten with a heated metal rod on arrival at his country of origin after UK officials refused to remove paperwork from his luggage which identified him with anti-government organisations there. Mostyn found that after his room at Brook House was cleared of belongings, a certificate was drawn up by officials making reference to \"various paperwork\". But during court proceedings, centre staff submitted a second \"doctored\" certificate, which scrubbed all mention of the paperwork. \"The conduct of the secretary of state's agents in falsifying the room clearance certificate is corrupt and truly shocking,\" Justice Mostyn said in his judgment Thursday. \"The original clean certificate was only produced by the secretary of state following a request made by the claimant's solicitors after the doctored certificate has been produced in evidence as exhibits to the witness statements of Tamara Burns, Marilyn Bennett and Matthew Newman,\" said Mostyn. The three officials behaved disgracefully, the judge said, adding: \"When agents of the state falsify documents it undermines, if not fatally then certainly very seriously, the trust of the people in the operation of the rule of law. \"It makes no difference if, as here, the agents are private contractors to whom the secretary of state has outsourced her powers. Corruption by state officials is insidious and corrosive and it is the duty of the authorities where it is found to root it out ruthlessly.\" Mostyn referred his findings of forgery and providing false witness testimony to the DPP and the attorney general. However, he added that his \"finding as to the turpitude of the agents of the secretary of state\" did not detract from the \"lack of credibility of the claimant\", and he dismissed the appeal.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Central bankers like to project a sense of serenity. The markets may be traumatised and the politicians may be panicking, but nothing fazes the technocrats in charge of our money. They are headmasterly figures: slightly detached but with their fingers on the pulse. That's the image. In reality, the central bankers are in a funk about the health of their nations' economies and the challenge of extricating their institutions from the stimulus policies that have been responsible for what has, so far, been a tepid global recovery. Why else would the Federal Reserve have bottled a decision on gradually winding down its bond-buying programme? Why else would the European Central Bank have surprised the markets with a cut in borrowing costs last week? Why else would the Bank of England feel the need to reassure the public that the 0.5% bank rate that has been in force since early 2009 would remain in place until unemployment came down to 7%, barring some unforeseen inflationary shock? Mark Carney will face the press this week for the first time since he outlined Threadneedle Street's forward guidance in August and the governor will have the job of explaining why unemployment is now expected to come down faster than the Bank predicted three months ago. On the face of it, this is an easy gig. Carney could stand up and say it is a jolly good thing the economy is doing better than expected and, therefore, interest rates can start to return to more normal levels a little earlier than planned. This, though, is the UK, and here there are really only three economic moods: periods when there is concern that the economy is not growing, periods when the worry is that it is growing too fast, and periods when a combination of steady growth and low inflation is considered too good to last. For now, the UK appears to have moved from fretting about a triple-dip recession to fears about overheating without any intervening Goldilocks period. Accordingly, the financial markets will be focused in coming months on barometers of excess demand: the housing market, the trade figures, earnings and consumer spending. Carney will have a period of grace before the markets start to demand action. In part that's because those indicators speaking of problems to come \u2013 the housing market and the trade balance \u2013 are flashing amber rather than red. In part, though, it is because problems are more acute elsewhere. For the Fed, it is a question of when to taper, not whether. It wants to continue supporting what is a historically modest recovery with low interest rates and quantitative easing, but thinks the amount of new money creation each month should be reduced. But it wants to do this without causing chaos either domestically or in the broader global economy. When the Fed chairman, Ben Bernanke, floated the idea of a gradual taper to bond-buying back in May, financial markets threw a fit. The laws of supply and demand have meant that bond prices have risen as central banks have bought more and more of them. The interest rate on a bond goes down as the price goes up, and these interest rates (bond yields) affect how much it costs firms and households to borrow over long periods. Speculation about a Fed taper pushed up bond yields, which in turn made mortgages more expensive in the US. That put the dampers on the recovery in the housing market. The same laws of demand and supply meant that electronically printing trillions of dollars has driven down the value of the US currency. It has also created a massive pool of funds looking for places around the world where returns were high. This was not in the west, where both growth and interest rates were low, but the emerging world, where growth was strong and borrowing costs much higher. Even the threat of a Fed taper was enough to put this process into reverse. Money came flooding back out of emerging markets, putting pressure on their currencies as growth rates were slowing. Europe has a different problem. Relief during the summer that the eurozone was at last coming out of an 18-month double-dip recession pushed up the value of the single currency. But a stronger currency means lower inflation because the cost of imported goods falls. Inflation in the 17-nation bloc as a whole stands at 0.7%, well below the ECB's target of close to but just less than 2%. In those countries worst affected by the sovereign debt crisis it is already negative. Deflation is not always a bad thing. In fact, if you are a saver it is a good thing because your money goes further. For debtors, though, a period of falling prices means that your debt burden increases. If interest rates are rising, then you can quickly find yourself in a situation where your debt is increasingly unpayable even if your income is going up at the same time. What applies to individuals applies to countries also. Greece is already in a situation where it will require another bailout to make its debts sustainable and it wouldn't take much to push some other countries on the eurozone's periphery \u2013 Italy and Spain most notably \u2013 over the edge. Economists at Fathom financial consultants have modelled what would happen to eurozone debt sustainability given plausible (if relatively generous) assumptions for budget deficits, growth rates and inflation. They found that if primary government budget balances (excluding debt interest payments) and growth rates were set at their long-term average, debt sustainability hinges on what happens to inflation. At an inflation rate of 2%, the level of debt to national output (the debt to GDP ratio) declines for every country in the eurozone, including Greece. At 1%, and assuming a Fed taper leads to an increase in long-term interest rates of 1.5 percentage points in the next two years, debt becomes unsustainable for the peripheral eurozone countries. At zero inflation, even without a taper, debt sustainability is a problem for the core of the currency zone as well. This threat explains many things. It explains why ECB head Mario Draghi moved so quickly to cut ECB interest rates last week. It explains why there is a lot of nervousness about the upcoming asset quality review of Europe's banks, since they are awash with eurozone bonds. It explains why the Americans, who know a taper is coming, are openly frustrated with Germany's failure both to reflate and to press ahead with banking union. And it explains why the sang-froid of central bankers is strictly for show.",

If interest rates are rising, then you can quickly find yourself in a situation where your debt is increasingly unpayable even if your income is going up at the same time.</p> <p>What applies to individuals applies to countries also. Greece is already in a situation where it will require another bailout to make its debts sustainable and it wouldn't take much to push some other countries on the eurozone's periphery \u2013 Italy and Spain most notably \u2013 over the edge.</p> <p>Economists at Fathom financial consultants have modelled what would happen to eurozone debt sustainability given plausible (if relatively generous) assumptions for budget deficits, growth rates and inflation. They found that if primary government budget balances (excluding debt interest payments) and growth rates were set at their long-term average, debt sustainability hinges on what happens to inflation.</p> <p>At an inflation rate of 2%, the level of debt to national output (the debt to GDP ratio) declines for every country in the eurozone, including Greece. At 1%, and assuming a Fed taper leads to an increase in long-term interest rates of 1.5 percentage points in the next two years, debt becomes unsustainable for the peripheral eurozone countries. At zero inflation, even without a taper, debt sustainability is a problem for the core of the currency zone as well.</p> <p>This threat explains many things. It explains why ECB head Mario Draghi moved so quickly to cut ECB interest rates last week. It explains why there is a lot of nervousness about the upcoming asset quality review of Europe's banks, since they are awash with eurozone bonds. It explains why the Americans, who know a taper is coming, are openly frustrated with Germany's failure both to reflate and to press ahead with banking union. And it explains why the sang-froid of central bankers is strictly for show.</p>",

At the Co-op Group's half-yearly meeting on Saturday in Manchester, Len Wardle, the chairman of the UK's biggest mutual organisation, told delegates that payments to members could not be sanctioned while the bank was exacting losses on the group, whose origins date back to the Rochdale pioneers in 1844. \"Our decision not to pay a half-year interim dividend was not a decision that was taken lightly.

The Co-op Group is pumping \u00a3462m into the bank and ceding control of 70% to bondholders \u2013 led by two US hedge funds \u2013 which are putting in another \u00a31bn to meet the demands of regulators at the Bank of England. In August, the group reported a loss of \u00a3559m for the first six months of the year because of \u00a3700m of losses at the bank which had incurred a series of bad loans largely from its merger with Britannia Building Society in 2009. The decision not to pay the dividend is a setback for the Co-op, which only reinstated the perk for members seven years ago as part of its attempt to revitalise the co-operative movement. A year ago the group paid out \u00a38m in dividends. Wardle told delegates that the group was devising an additional reward scheme for members in the run-up to Christmas but did not reveal details.",

      "bodyText": "After decades of industrial decline, the loss of another couple of thousand jobs in shipbuilding \u2013 a business that conjures up grainy images of steam liners easing down slipways \u2013 might easily be written off as an unavoidable sign of the times. But last week's announcement came at a moment when manufacturing is meant to be thriving. The coalition has set great store by the idea of \"rebalancing\" Britain's economy away from the boom-bust, credit-fuelled growth of the years running up to the crisis towards an economic model that will allow us to pay our way in the world. In part at least, that means building things other countries want to buy. However, the marked improvement in the economic weather since the start of 2013, which has seen experts rushing to upgrade forecasts, has so far not been driven by an industrial revival. According to the latest official figures, while the services sector \u2013 from restaurants to shops to City accountants \u2013 has bounced back strongly and is now producing more than it did before 2008, manufacturing and construction output both remain almost 10% below their peak. Much of the optimism about industry has been based on the idea that the cheaper pound will make British goods more competitive and coax manufacturers into exploring new markets. The chancellor has said he would like to see a doubling of exports, to \u00a31 trillion a year, by 2020. Yet so far, Britain's trade gap with the rest of the world has remained stubbornly unmoved \u2013 the latest official figures showed the deficit for September at \u00a39.8bn, its highest level for almost a year, and there are a number of reasons to doubt whether we are on the brink of an export-driven economic revival. First, even five years on from the credit crunch, the seized-up financial sector is making it hard for small and medium-sized businesses to get finance. That means existing firms may struggle to gear up to produce different products for new markets \u2013 or even just to ratchet up production in response to rising demand \u2013 while new firms may find it harder to get backing. Secondly, while ministers have seized every opportunity to travel the world promoting trade opportunities in emerging markets, including China, India and Brazil, the hard reality is that exports to these countries are expanding from a very low base. The eurozone, where growth is expected to remain sluggish for the foreseeable future, remains our major trading partner. Belgium and Luxembourg between them bought more British goods in September than China, for example. Thirdly, sterling's continued weakness cannot be taken for granted. The euro fell sharply last week after the European Central Bank cut interest rates to revive the area's flagging economy. With Mark Carney likely to announce this week that the Bank of England has upgraded its growth forecasts and brought forward the date by which it expects unemployment to fall to 7%, opening the way for a rate rise, the pound could continue to drift higher \u2013 not great news for exporters. Finally, there must at the very least be a question mark about the readiness of the manufacturing sector, hollowed out by years of attrition, to assemble the expertise, the skilled workforce and the entrepreneurial flair it will take to bring about a genuine renaissance. A recent analysis by the Office for National Statistics showed that what upturn there has been in manufacturing had been overwhelmingly dominated by the (super-productive, overwhelmingly foreign-owned) car industry. Without transport equipment \u2013 the category that includes carmakers \u2013 manufacturing output was no higher by this summer than it was during the depths of the 2008-09 recession. The government is trying hard to nurture hi-tech businesses in promising sectors such as green technology and cell therapy \u2013 by investing \u00a31bn in \"catapult centres\" to share expertise, for example. But even if the flow of cash from the banks is eventually unblocked, and the coalition's efforts bear fruit, it will take time. With house prices picking up, consumer borrowing rising fast against a background of stagnant wages, and \"real estate activities\" one of the most rapidly expanding areas of job growth, some experts are nervous about how sustainable the current upturn can be. But manufacturers' spirits are improving too, if recent business surveys are to be believed: perhaps the best hope is that rising confidence will eventually feed through into rising investment, jobs and growth \u2013 and a flourishing of new industries alongside declining ones such as the dockyards.",

      "bodyText": "A basic tenet of British political life since at least the 1980s has been that rising house prices are a good thing. Yet a poll for housing charity Shelter suggests that an extraordinary shift is taking place. Two-thirds of the public would apparently now prefer it if the cost of property remained stable, or even fell. Perhaps it's not surprising, when house-price-to-income ratios have shot up in many parts of the country over the past 15 years, that the priced-out are starting to outnumber, and potentially outvote, the winners of the property lottery. But if the allure of inflating prices really has begun to wane, the political implications could be profound. In her very first party conference speech as Conservative leader in 1975, Margaret Thatcher put home ownership right at the heart of what, even then, she was calling her \"vision\". \"Let me give you my vision: a man's right to work as he will, to spend what he earns, to own property, to have the state as servant and not as master \u2013 these are the British inheritance.\" Stirring stuff: and the pursuit of the well-intentioned and understandable notion of a man's right to own property (which, hopefully, we could now extend to women too) has shaped public policy and framed political debate over the ensuing decades \u2013 interpreted through a very Thatcherite, free-market lens. It brought us the right to buy council homes and the liberalisation of mortgage lending, allowing millions more people to own the roof over their heads. And, most recently, it's brought us George Osborne's much-derided Help to Buy scheme. But as prices rose amid stagnating supply, while demand was fuelled by ever-laxer lending rules, widening home ownership created a noisy interest group to oppose any policy that might impinge on householders' right, not just to own a property, but to use it to generate a speculative cash pile. Council tax revaluations \u2013 which would levy a heavier charge on more valuable properties \u2013 became politically impossible (there hasn't been one since it was introduced in 1993). Fearsome nimbys have fought off repeated efforts to reform the planning system. And Labour \u2013 which did little to dislodge the neoliberal consensus \u2013 ended up taking on the Tories in an inheritance-tax-cut bidding war, as homeowners defended their \"right\" to hang on to every penny of their property windfall. Real house prices in the UK are almost two-and-a-half times higher than they were in the mid-1970s. In Germany, they've been flat for three decades. Ultimately, chasing the goal of a property-owning democracy has had the perverse outcome of creating a world in which it is all but impossible for many families on average incomes to contemplate buying a house. Instead, they find themselves trapped in insecure, often poorly maintained rental accommodation, while taxpayers spend more than \u00a320bn a year on housing benefit. Perhaps not surprisingly then, a separate poll last week showed that 45% of voters favour the rather retro, dirigiste approach of government rent controls, against 43% who oppose them. As part of its latest economic review, the Office for National Statistics tracked changes in the proportion of disposable (after-tax) income households have spent on various essentials over the past decade. The politically salient rise in energy prices shows up clearly: looking at gas and electricity combined, utility bills now gobble up more than 3% of disposable income, against 1.8% in 2003. But the real shocker is the rocketing price of housing \u2013 whether rent or the cost of owning a home \u2013 which now swallows up almost 21% of disposable income, compared to less than 15% a decade ago. It's a key element of what Ed Miliband calls the cost-of-living crisis. Against that background \u2013 and with real wages stagnating \u2013 perhaps it shouldn't be surprising that the middle ground of public opinion is beginning to regard rising house prices as a burden instead of a boon. Even the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors \u2013 the voice of estate agents \u2013 has called for the Bank of England to consider capping house price inflation at 5%, to avoid destabilising booms and busts. The policy framework for the property market has already shifted to reflect the lessons of the credit crisis: the Bank of England's financial policy committee has been given the power to tighten capital requirements on banks to bear down on particular types of lending \u2013 high loan-to-value ratio mortgages, for example \u2013 if it sees a bubble inflating. But an acceptance that stable house prices are desirable would open up political and practical possibilities that have been shut down for many years. Miliband's hint that a Labour government might try to force developers to build on unused land, instead of sitting on it, was dismissed by the Tories as \"Stalinist\", and the Lib Dems' demand for a mansion tax have repeatedly been rejected by coalition colleagues. But if the Shelter poll is right, the Tories may be misjudging the national mood. Ramping up housebuilding \u2013 even through the unfashionable method of using taxpayer funds \u2013 is perhaps the most obvious solution, but Bank of England governor Mark Carney should stand ready to exercise the Bank's new powers freely: if necessary, targeting frothy London specifically. All the parties should also take a long, hard look at the taxation of property, to ensure that it is as progressive as possible \u2013 and to discourage damaging practices such as hanging on to empty homes as a speculative investment. And making renting less insecure \u2013 rather than assuming it's a short-term phase \u2013 is also important. It would be a brave politician who sought to ditch what Thatcher called \"a man's right to own property\". But the changing public mood suggests it's time to give housing policy a much-needed reboot.",

      "body": "<p>Dave Harris, owner of Dave's Barber Shop just outside Portsmouth naval base, was sitting on one of his chairs, head in hands. He was bitterly sorry for the shipbuilders whose hair he had cut for years, and worried for his own business. That morning BAE Systems and the government had announced the end of 500&#xa0;years of shipbuilding on the site with the loss of 940 jobs.</p> <p>\"It's terrible news,\" he said. \"I've got to know many of the lads who work there. They're going to have a miserable Christmas now. It's a shocker. I know they say it's all about business, but it looks like it's a political decision. It's got to be about the independence thing.\"</p> <p>Referring to the decision to keep two sister sites open on the Clyde, he added: \"The government's trying to keep the Scots sweet. But Portsmouth is all about military shipbuilding. It's a huge part of the place.\"</p> <p>BAE blamed a significant drop in demand for its decision to cut 1,775 jobs at its yards in Scotland and England.</p> <p>\"The company remains committed to continued investment in the Portsmouth area as the centre of its maritime services and high-end naval equipment and combat systems business,\" it said in a statement. But the admission that operations in Govan and Scotstoun will be protected was seen \u2013 and not just by Harris \u2013 as a blatant bid to avoid handing a PR gift to Scottish nationalists.</p> <p>Harris offers bargain haircuts to service personnel and dockyard workers \u2013 \u00a37.50 against \u00a38.95 to civilians. \"The navy is my main customer, but the dock workers are a close second. I'd say they're about 20% of my trade. That's why I've been sitting with my head in my hands.

      "bodyText": "Dave Harris, owner of Dave's Barber Shop just outside Portsmouth naval base, was sitting on one of his chairs, head in hands. He was bitterly sorry for the shipbuilders whose hair he had cut for years, and worried for his own business. That morning BAE Systems and the government had announced the end of 500 years of shipbuilding on the site with the loss of 940 jobs. \"It's terrible news,\" he said. \"I've got to know many of the lads who work there. They're going to have a miserable Christmas now. It's a shocker. I know they say it's all about business, but it looks like it's a political decision. It's got to be about the independence thing.\" Referring to the decision to keep two sister sites open on the Clyde, he added: \"The government's trying to keep the Scots sweet. But Portsmouth is all about military shipbuilding. It's a huge part of the place.\" BAE blamed a significant drop in demand for its decision to cut 1,775 jobs at its yards in Scotland and England. \"The company remains committed to continued investment in the Portsmouth area as the centre of its maritime services and high-end naval equipment and combat systems business,\" it said in a statement. But the admission that operations in Govan and Scotstoun will be protected was seen \u2013 and not just by Harris \u2013 as a blatant bid to avoid handing a PR gift to Scottish nationalists. Harris offers bargain haircuts to service personnel and dockyard workers \u2013 \u00a37.50 against \u00a38.95 to civilians. \"The navy is my main customer, but the dock workers are a close second. I'd say they're about 20% of my trade. That's why I've been sitting with my head in my hands. This is a big blow for me.\" Further down Queen Street towards the historic dockyard, resting place of Henry VIII's Mary Rose and of Nelson's Victory, and the same sentiments are repeated.
