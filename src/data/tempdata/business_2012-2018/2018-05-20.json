      "bodyText": "Royal Dutch Shell faces a shareholder challenge over climate change this week, as investors insist oil and gas firms should offer more transparency and action on carbon emissions. A growing number of pension funds have backed a resolution at Shell\u2019s AGM on Tuesday that calls on the company to set tougher carbon targets that are in line with the goals of the Paris climate deal. The proposal has been backed by the Church of England, the Dutch pension fund Aegon and, most recently, Nest, the workplace pension scheme set up by the UK government, which has \u00a37m invested in Shell. Mark van Baal, the founder of Follow This, a Dutch campaign group that brought the resolution, said: \u201cInvestors have a choice: vote for Shell\u2019s \u2018whatever world\u2019 or vote for the world of the Church of England, a world in which all companies set targets to limit climate change to well below 2C.\u201d The resolution has been highlighted by 60 large investors managing more $10.4tn (\u00a37.72tn) in assets, though they stopped short of publicly backing it. \u201cRegardless of the result at the Shell AGM, we strongly encourage all companies in this sector to clarify how they see their future in a low-carbon world,\u201d the investors \u2013 who include Axa Investment Managers and Legal &amp; General Investment Management \u2013 wrote in an open letter. It is the third year in a row that Follow This has brought a climate resolution to Shell\u2019s AGM. Ben van Beurden, Shell\u2019s chief executive, has admitted the resolutions played a role in convincing the firm to announce a plan to halve the carbon footprint of the energy it sells by 2050. Follow This has welcomed the move but said it is not enough. Meanwhile, influential shareholder advisers have urged investors to oppose the CEO\u2019s remuneration package, which rose to \u20ac8.9m (\u00a37.79m) in 2017. Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) said Van Beurden\u2019s \u20ac3m (\u00a32.63m) bonus was not warranted, given how the firm performed on its sustainable development targets. The advisory group Pensions and Investment Research Consultants (Pirc) also recommended opposition. A Shell spokesperson said the company \u201cstrongly disagreed\u201d with ISS\u2019s concerns, noting that the advisory group had supported the policy that put the bonus framework in place. The spokesperson added: \u201cWe share the objective of Follow This for Shell to show leadership in the energy transition but we consider their resolution unnecessary as we have already outlined an approach, through our industry-leading net carbon footprint ambition, that is wider-ranging and more progressive.\u201d The rival oil firm BP also faces a potential challenge \u2013 over pay \u2013 during its AGM in Manchester on Monday, the first time the London-based firm has held the event outside the capital in more than a century. The British firm said about 40% of its shareholders lived north of Birmingham, and Manchester\u2019s location and transport links would be convenient for retail investors. The company\u2019s healthy profits off higher oil prices mean the extraordinary 2016 shareholder revolt over chief executive Bob Dudley\u2019s \u00a314m pay package is unlikely to be repeated. But some proxy adviser groups have urged investors to reject Dudley\u2019s \u00a39.5m remuneration for 2017, which Pirc said was at an \u201cunacceptable\u201d ratio of 48:1 compared to average employee pay.",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s increasingly reliance on electricity imported from Europe threatens energy security and will import carbon emissions, according to the new boss of the country\u2019s biggest power station. Will Gardiner, chief executive of Drax Group, said that the growing proportion of power forecast to come from interconnectors \u2013 physical links to transfer electricity across borders \u2013 would also fail to deliver the aims of the government\u2019s industrial strategy. \u201cThe hot topic at the moment is what we do about interconnectors,\u201d said Gardiner, who wants to build a vast new gas power and battery storage plant at the company\u2019s North Yorkshire coal and biomass power station. The government expects imports to supply 22% of electricity by 2025, up from 6% last year. A slew of new electricity links are under construction or planned for the next decade between the UK and France, Belgium, Denmark, Norway and Germany. Three of those recently won contracts in a \u201ccapacity market\u201d auction of government subsidies for supplying backup power in the winter of 2021-22. That drove contract prices too low to encourage large new gas plants to be built and saw two of Drax\u2019s new small gas power stations miss out on contracts. Gardiner said the prices were a win for consumers, but added that interconnectors failed on other measures. \u201cImproved security of supply is one of the objectives of the auction, and I don\u2019t think interconnectors do that,\u201d he said. \u201cWill they show up when they\u2019re called? Maybe they will.\u201d While energy debates are currently dominated by cost, Gardiner said ministers\u2019 priorities were likely to swing back to security of supply, driven by events such as the \u201cbeast from the east\u201d cold weather, which put pressure on the country\u2019s energy system. Gardiner said that because the UK carbon price was higher than on the continent, more electricity links meant the UK would be importing emissions. Interconnectors would not help the government\u2019s industrial strategy, he said. \u201cAre they supporting things that will bring jobs and technology to the UK that will ultimately be exportable? I don\u2019t think interconnectors meet that test. I think a new gas plant using next-generation battery technology at Drax does.\u201d Drax wants the government to further \u201cderate\u201d interconnectors in the capacity market, which would see them receive lower financial rewards. Gardiner, Drax\u2019s former chief financial officer, took over the reins at the company in January when Dorothy Thompson stepped down after 12 years, having converted half of the plant to burning biomass instead of coal. In an interview with the Guardian, he said it was increasingly clear that electricity supplies globally and in the UK would be decarbonised by wind and solar. Both technologies had cut costs with \u201cbreathtaking\u201d speed, he said, adding that the flexibility of biomass made it a natural partner for renewables. However, he ruled out diversifying into large solar and wind projects, saying other firms were better equipped. Gardiner said the UK\u2019s other low-carbon option, nuclear power, was too expensive. \u201cI am not a fan of sweetheart deals, the government sitting down with Hitachi and writing them a cheque. That\u2019s not good economics,\u201d he said, referring to Hitachi\u2019s chairman meeting with Theresa May earlier this month to discuss a financial support package to build a new nuclear plant. Drax hopes its gas and battery plant project will get planning permission next autumn. But giving the green light on the investment will hinge on whether the company can secure a capacity market contract in an auction in winter 2019. The firm building a new interconnector through the Channel tunnel rejected Drax\u2019s criticism, noting that countries such as Norway, Denmark and France were largely powered by hydro, wind and nuclear respectively. \u201cWe believe the argument that interconnectors import carbon emissions to be unfounded as the majority of interconnectors connect, or will connect, the UK to countries with a lower carbon intensity,\u201d said Steven Moore, chief executive of ElecLink.",

    "webTitle": "Marks & Spencer to reveal dozens of store closures", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Hundreds of Marks &amp; Spencer staff will find out as soon as Monday whether their store is closing, as the retailer accelerates its retrenchment from struggling UK high streets. The M&amp;S chief executive, Steve Rowe, is shutting 100 of its large clothing and food shops amid falling sales and profits. It has already closed 20, affecting about 900 jobs, but staff are braced for the axe to fall on another tranche of stores before the announcement of its annual results on Wednesday. The closures are part of a plan announced 18 months ago to slash the amount of shopfloor space devoted to its ailing clothing ranges. Initially, just 30 out of a group of 105 underperforming stores were to shut but Rowe has decided on a more aggressive closure plan as sales move online. The City is expecting M&amp;S to report a second year of falling profits with analysts pencilling in pretax profits of \u00a3573m, down from \u00a3614m in 2017. Clothing and home like-for-like sales are forecast to be down 1.1%, with food sales dropping by 0.2%. After several years of disappointing financial results, the restructuring at M&amp;S has entered a more radical phase since Archie Norman was installed as chairman. There have been a number of casualties in the boardroom including Andy Adcock, the boss of its upmarket food halls, who has been replaced, and marketing chief Patrick Bousquet-Chavanne. When the company updated investors six months ago, Norman was frank about the scale of its problems. M&amp;S had been \u201cdrifting\u201d for more than 15 years, he said, as he promised to speed up store changes and tackle its misfiring food business. Rowe has been in charge for two years but, with no green shoots to celebrate and a backdrop of weak consumer spending, M&amp;S\u2019s share price has fallen by nearly a quarter over the past year. The decline means the 134-year-old retailer\u2019s place in the prestigious FTSE 100 could now be in jeopardy. M&amp;S has been a member of the blue chip index since its inception in 1984 but could be relegated to the FTSE 250 in a stock exchange reshuffle next week. Relegation would be a symbolic moment for the British institution that has struggled to hang on to shoppers in a digital age. Ocado, the online grocer, and Asos, the fashion website, are now worth more than M&amp;S in market value terms in a sign of the sea change in shopping habits. Ocado surged past M&amp;S on Thursday after it struck a major deal with US supermarket chain Kroger.

As one group of analysts said the chaos could cost TSB as much as \u00a356m this year alone, many of the problems that have bedeviled the bank are yet to be resolved as the crisis enters its fifth week. TSB mortgage account holders are still unable to access accounts online, while business customers continue to face problems making online payments. Some credit card customers are still being wrongly told that payment of \u00a30.00 will be taken, while the bank\u2019s internal secure messaging service remains unavailable. Personal customers have been furious at the bank\u2019s lack of response after they had their accounts cleared out by fraudsters. One said he was only refunded after he spent three days camped in his local branch. Another, whose mother had died, said he was forced to drive from London to Wimborne in Dorset to inform her local bank branch, as it was impossible to get through on the phone. At the beginning of May, TSB\u2019s chief executive Paul Pester told MPs that the bank would have things back to normal \u201csoon\u201d. However, it is clear that the problems have proved harder to fix than previously thought. Pester told the Treasury select committee the bank had received 40,000 complaints about the outage. He was accused of complacency for saying the migration had mostly gone smoothly, and not knowing exactly how many of the bank\u2019s 1.9 million online customers had been affected. Customers began experiencing problems with their accounts on Sunday 22 April after the bank \u2013 owned by Spanish lender Sabadell \u2013 migrated from an IT system inherited from the previous owner, Lloyds Banking Group. Sabadell had hoped to make more than \u00a3100m in annual savings by using the new system. However, it now look set to lose most of that in fines and other payments. Analysts at Royal Bank of Canada said last week that the group faced fines of an estimated \u00a316m from UK financial regulators. Following Royal Bank of Scotland\u2019s June 2012 IT meltdown that left some people locked out of their accounts for days on end, the much bigger RBS paid fines of \u00a356m. The Canadian bank said TSB\u2019s offer to hike the interest rate on its Classic plus account to 5% will have cost \u00a322m by the end of this year. The decision to waive overdraft and other interest charges for two months will set it back \u00a318m, giving a \u00a356m hit this year. TSB disputes RBC\u2019s calculations, though, and says it is working around the clock to fix the problems. \u201cWe\u2019re aware that RBC has agreed to reissue its report, as the basis for the conclusions was clearly misleading and based on a tiny fraction of customers. Our focus is putting things right for our customers \u2013 and no customer will be out of pocket as a result of what\u2019s happened,\u201d a TSB spokeswoman said.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "William Hague once described the euro as a burning building with no exits, and the experience of Italy over the past 20 years has proved that the then Conservative party leader was absolutely right. Joining the single currency was made easy at the end of the 1990s. As one of the original signatories of the treaty of Rome, Italy desperately wanted to be in monetary union\u2019s first wave. But there was no real examination of whether a country like Italy \u2013 with its inflationary tendencies \u2013 could actually cope with the rigours of single-currency membership. There was no equivalent of Gordon Brown\u2019s five tests that the then chancellor said had to be passed before Britain could join. On the contrary, when it became clear that Italy would not meet the criteria, the rules were bent to make sure it did. The result: two lost economic decades in which living standards have stagnated, which is why Italy has given up on mainstream politics. A coalition government of two populist and euro-sceptic parties \u2013 the Five Star Movement and the League \u2013 appears imminent. Although neither wing of the coalition has any love for the euro, they have already discovered the truth of Hague\u2019s words. Their draft policy agreement included the proposal that the EU should establish a procedure for countries to leave the euro where there was \u201cpopular will\u201d to do so, but this has now been dropped. It\u2019s not hard to see why. Were the financial markets to think that the new populist government was serious about leaving the single currency, Italian government bonds would become riskier. Investors would demand a higher return for holding them and that would drive up market interest rates. The European Central Bank could help by buying Italian bonds, but would have little incentive to help a government in Rome intent on undermining \u2013 if not destroying \u2013 monetary union. A financial crisis would envelop the new government. Italy\u2019s shaky banking system would collapse and the country would descend into a deep recession. Unemployment would rise and the Five Star Movement and the League would be blamed. The populists would quickly become unpopular. So the new Italian government is in the same position as all the other governments the country has had over the past two decades: membership of the single currency is a curse but trying to leave the euro would be even worse. Like Greece, Italy is discovering that it is a bit late to say that it would have been better to have constructed the euro with a few fire escapes. It is actually easier for Britain \u2013 with its own central bank and its own currency \u2013 to leave the EU than it is for Italy to leave the euro. But even if Italy shies away from monetary independence, the new government still has plans for tax and spending that pose a challenge to the way the eurozone has been run hitherto. These involve a new citizens\u2019 income, more generous pensions and lower taxes. Estimates suggest these measures will cost around \u20ac60bn a year \u2013 some 3.5% of Italy\u2019s GDP. This would drive a coach and horses through the eurozone\u2019s fiscal rules, which impose strict limits on the size to which a budget deficit is allowed to run. It would also send Italy\u2019s debt ratio \u2013 the size of the country\u2019s public debt in relation to the size of its economy \u2013 up from just over 130% of GDP to around 150% of GDP. The prospect of a marked loosening of policy scares the financial markets and won\u2019t go down well in other European capitals either. But actually, the coalition\u2019s fiscal policies make sense. The real problem lies with the eurozone\u2019s absurdly deflationary fiscal rules. As Dhaval Joshi of BCA Research has pointed out, Italy is in some respects similar to Japan. Both countries faced difficulties because their zombie banks proved incapable of lending to the private sector. Japan solved this problem by getting the public sector to do the lending, even though this meant a big increase in its debt ratio. Italy is in a worse position because the eurozone\u2019s fiscal rules mean it has not been allowed to run bigger budget deficits. Italy has lower total indebtedness \u2013 private and public combined \u2013 than Britain, France and Spain, but as far as the EU\u2019s fiscal rules are concerned only public debt matters. Joshi notes: \u201cHence, the Italian government was prevented from recapitalising its banking system, and the Italian economy stagnated for a decade.\u201d Those in charge of the single currency know that as it stands the euro is an unfinished project. It could be completed by the reform package proposed by the French president Emmanuel Macron, which would involve fiscal union as well as monetary union, presided over by a eurozone finance minister. There is not the remotest possibility that Macron could get the new government in Rome to sign up to his plan even if he could secure the full-throated backing of Germany. One alternative to Macron\u2019s scheme is to allow members of the eurozone more freedom to run fiscal policies that meet their own needs, which is what Italy\u2019s populist coalition is demanding. At present, the rules mean that any struggling country can only make itself more competitive through internal deflation \u2013 cost cutting and austerity. The other is to allow things to drift on as they are and hope for the best. This has seen the euro through one crisis \u2013 just \u2013 but would not see it through another. The risk is not that one country will jump out of the burning building but that the building will eventually collapse with everybody in it.",

As one of the original signatories of the treaty of Rome, Italy desperately wanted to be in monetary union\u2019s first wave.</p> <p>But there was no real examination of whether a country like Italy \u2013 with its inflationary tendencies \u2013 could actually cope with the rigours of single-currency membership. There was no equivalent of Gordon Brown\u2019s five tests that the then chancellor said had to be passed before Britain could join.</p> <p>On the contrary, when it became clear that Italy would not meet the criteria, the rules were bent to make sure it did. The result: two lost economic decades in which living standards have stagnated, which is why Italy has given up on mainstream politics. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/17/italys-m5s-and-league-parties-poised-to-sign-government-deal\">A coalition government of two populist and euro-sceptic parties \u2013 the Five Star Movement and the League \u2013 appears imminent</a>. <br></p> <p>Although neither wing of the coalition has any love for the euro, they have already discovered the truth of Hague\u2019s words. Their draft policy agreement included the proposal that the EU should establish a procedure for countries to leave the euro where there was \u201cpopular will\u201d to do so, but this has now been dropped.</p> <p>It\u2019s not hard to see why. Were the financial markets to think that the new populist government was serious about leaving the single currency, Italian government bonds would become riskier. Investors would demand a higher return for holding them and that would drive up market interest rates. The European Central Bank could help by buying Italian bonds, but would have little incentive to help a government in Rome intent on undermining \u2013 if not destroying \u2013 monetary union.</p> <p>A financial crisis would envelop the new government. Italy\u2019s shaky banking system would collapse and the country would descend into a deep recession. Unemployment would rise and the Five Star Movement and the League would be blamed. The populists would quickly become unpopular.</p> <p>So the new Italian government is in the same position as all the other governments the country has had over the past two decades: membership of the single currency is a curse but trying to leave the euro would be even worse. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jul/30/greek-debt-crisis-people-cant-see-any-light-at-the-end-of-any-tunnel\">Like Greece</a>, Italy is discovering that it is a bit late to say that it would have been better to have constructed the euro with a few fire escapes. It is actually easier for Britain \u2013 with its own central bank and its own currency \u2013 to leave the EU than it is for Italy to leave the euro.</p> <p>But even if Italy shies away from monetary independence, the new government still has plans for tax and spending that pose a challenge to the way the eurozone has been run hitherto. These involve a new citizens\u2019 income, more generous pensions and lower taxes. Estimates suggest these measures will cost around \u20ac60bn a year \u2013 some 3.5% of Italy\u2019s GDP.</p> <p>This would drive a coach and horses through the eurozone\u2019s fiscal rules, which impose strict limits on the size to which a budget deficit is allowed to run. It would also send Italy\u2019s debt ratio \u2013 the size of the country\u2019s public debt in relation to the size of its economy \u2013 up from just over 130% of GDP to around 150% of GDP.</p> <p>The prospect of a marked loosening of policy scares the financial markets and won\u2019t go down well in other European capitals either. But actually, the coalition\u2019s fiscal policies make sense. The real problem lies with the eurozone\u2019s absurdly deflationary fiscal rules.</p> <p>As Dhaval Joshi of BCA Research has pointed out, Italy is in some respects similar to Japan. Both countries faced difficulties because their zombie banks proved incapable of lending to the private sector. Japan solved this problem by getting the public sector to do the lending, even though this meant a big increase in its debt ratio. Italy is in a worse position because the eurozone\u2019s fiscal rules mean it has not been allowed to run bigger budget deficits.</p> <p>Italy has lower total indebtedness \u2013 private and public combined \u2013 than Britain, France and Spain, but as far as the EU\u2019s fiscal rules are concerned only public debt matters. Joshi notes: \u201cHence, the Italian government was prevented from recapitalising its banking system, and the Italian economy stagnated for a decade.\u201d</p> <p>Those in charge of the single currency know that as it stands the euro is an unfinished project. It could be completed by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/26/profound-transformation-macron-lays-out-vision-for-post-brexit-eu\">reform package proposed by the French president Emmanuel Macron,</a> which would involve fiscal union as well as monetary union, presided over by a eurozone finance minister.</p> <p>There is not the remotest possibility that Macron could get the new government in Rome to sign up to his plan even if he could secure the full-throated backing of Germany.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Guardian business email sign-up\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>One alternative to Macron\u2019s scheme is to allow members of the eurozone more freedom to run fiscal policies that meet their own needs, which is what Italy\u2019s populist coalition is demanding. At present, the rules mean that any struggling country can only make itself more competitive through internal deflation \u2013 cost cutting and austerity. <br></p> <p>The other is to allow things to drift on as they are and hope for the best. This has seen the euro through one crisis \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2015/jul/12/greek-debt-crisis-eu-leaders-meeting-cancelled-no-deal-live\">just</a> \u2013 but would not see it through another. The risk is not that one country will jump out of the burning building but that the building will eventually collapse with everybody in it.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Just like Napoleon, Leon Trotsky and (presumably by early July) England football manager Gareth Southgate, BP boss Bob Dudley knows all about swift retreats from Russia. In 2008 the veteran oil exec fled the country, and his then post as head of BP\u2019s Russian joint venture TNK-BP, following an \u201corchestrated campaign of harassment\u201d. Still, having become chief executive of the whole of BP in 2010, Dudley now takes his persecution from more genteel City types, and who would blame him for that? The flight from Moscow \u2013 it was provoked by some henchman bugging Dudley\u2019s office, among other things \u2013 has always sounded mildly terrifying. But it has been replaced in Dudley\u2019s life by the confected spectacle of the annual \u201cBP pay row\u201d, where a few fund managers politely ask the American each year if he might consider sparing the chaps any embarrassment by not trousering such a vulgar pay packet. Somehow, that lacks similar levels of menace. The recent headlines reveal what a charade a City campaign of harassment can be: \u201cBP risks fresh pay row in 2017 over boss Dudley\u2019s share award\u201d (Sky News); \u201cBP faces investor revolt over chief executive\u2019s pay\u201d (Financial Times, 2016); \u201cBP boss faces investor protest vote against \u00a310m pay packet\u201d (Daily Mail, 2015). With the group\u2019s shareholders preparing for the oil major\u2019s latest annual meeting this week, the same stories have returned again. Shareholder advisory service Pirc has told BP investors: \u201cPerformance share awards granted during the year under review are excessive, amounting to 363.7% of salary for the chief executive. Total variable pay for the year under review is also inappropriately excessive, amounting to 581% of salary.\u201d Yet despite all of this noise and common sense, shareholders will get to vote this week on a pay packet of $13.4m (\u00a39.9m) \u2013 which has actually risen from the $11.9m that appeared to be causing so much irritation the year before. You\u2019d be forgiven for thinking that Dudley simply has to endure a bit of sniping each May as a condition of earning eight figures. So, maybe he should be asked to take a pay cut by a shadowy figure with a Russian accent who Dudley discovers sitting in his office one morning? At least that would be original. Still, while avarice might be one of the seven Dudley sins, the system looks more culpable. Rival Royal Dutch Shell, which is also facing a \u201cpay revolt\u201d this week, has been criticised by the admirably persistent Pirc too for its \u201cexcessive\u201d executive pay. Chief executive Ben van Beurden\u2019s \u201ctotal realised variable pay\u201d is considered \u201cexcessive\u201d at 471% of his base salary and there has been a similarly depressing history of these protests. But all of these huge wage packets are devised by businesspeople \u2013 whose own interests are hardly served by suppressing executive pay. On Shell\u2019s remuneration committee is Gerard Kleisterlee, a former Philips boss who the FT says was \u201cunrepentant\u201d when he got caught up in a pay row at the electronics group. At BP, the longest-serving member of the remuneration committee is Ian Davis, the former boss of management consultant McKinsey, a firm which some partly credit with creating the \u201cCEO-to-worker gap\u201d in pay through its efforts in the 1950s with General Motors. Tactics may be more civilised in the City, but when comparing London to Moscow it is tempting to ask one question: which city runs the biggest racket?",

    "webTitle": "Oil price keeps rising \u2013 will it come back to earth with a bump?", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The big story in the financial markets in 2018 has been the sharp rise in oil prices, which last week hit $80 a barrel for the first time in four years. But if oil analysts are right and the cost of crude is set to carry on rising, hitting $100 a barrel over the coming months, the big story of 2019 is going to be how oil came down to earth with a bump. There are, without question, solid reasons for the oil price rises. The global economy has been performing more strongly than expected, with almost every region doing its bit to push up demand. Donald Trump\u2019s tax cuts in the US and the reluctance of the Bank of Japan and the European Central Bank to tighten policy mean there is no immediate threat of recession. On the other side of the equation, supply has been kept in check. Part of this \u2013 the Opec production curbs \u2013 was planned. Other aspects of it \u2013 the chaos in Venezuela and Donald Trump\u2019s decision to pull out of the Iran nuclear deal \u2013 were not. As a result, there is no longer an oil glut as there was in the middle of the decade. If Iran is frozen out of the global oil market, other suppliers will eventually take up the slack. But it will take time for Opec members to ratchet up supply \u2013 even assuming that they decide to do so. The same applies to shale-oil producers in the US. Prices are going up because traders are speculating that demand for oil will exceed supply \u2013 and for now that looks like a reasonable assumption. But push things forward six or nine months and things look a bit different. Although the global economy seems healthy enough, it has eased back since hitting a peak in the final months of 2017 and early 2018. Europe had a weaker-than-expected first quarter; China is clearly slowing down. In the US, it is a different story. There, the economy is operating at close to full employment, investment is up and consumers are spending freely. But, in a classic case of the law of unintended consequences, any benefits Americans enjoy from Trump\u2019s tax cuts are soon going to be gobbled up by the higher fuel prices caused by the president\u2019s get-tough approach towards Iran. The Federal Reserve, America\u2019s central bank, is already thinking about raising interest rates three times before the end of this year, and is even more likely to act if it sees higher petrol and diesel prices pushing up inflation when the labour market is so tight. To be sure, there are reasons to think oil prices may hit $100 a barrel and carry on rising. With Trump in the White House, anything could happen. The Middle East could erupt into a full-scale conflict between Iran and Israel. The brittle detente between North Korea and the US could break down. In those circumstances, the cost of crude would stay higher for longer. But in the absence of a new geopolitical shock, oil prices will eventually start falling. In oil-importing countries, more expensive crude will eat in to the discretionary spending power of consumers, leading to weaker demand in 2019. This will happen just as the US public is starting to feel the impact of higher interest rates, and as the effects of the tax cuts are wearing off. On the supply side, two things will happen. First, US shale production \u2013 which is highly profitable with oil at $80 a barrel \u2013 will expand. Second, Opec producers will \u2013 whatever they say in public \u2013 quietly start to exceed their quotas in order to make up for the shortfall caused by sanctions on Iran. Demand for oil is going to fall while supply is going to rise. Markets do not always behave in the way the economics textbooks predict, but this time, they will. MPs were right to give Carillion chiefs a roasting The language of the joint select committee report into the collapse of Carillion was punchy, even bombastic. It told of \u201crecklessness, hubris and greed\u201d at the failed outsourcing firm, lamented a \u201crotten corporate culture\u201d and named and shamed three directors. The Confederation of British Industry was not impressed. Deputy director general Josh Hardie complained that the report was irresponsible, giving and gave the impression that British business in general was greedy and reckless. Such \u201cknee-jerk soundbites\u201d \u2013 as he described the choicest phrases \u2013 risked harming investment in Britain. Perhaps the criticisms struck a little too close to home. After all, Carillion was taken to task for its aggressive accounting, including booking revenues it had not yet pocketed. That\u2019s not a million miles away from the accounting scandal at Tesco, where corporate responsibility fell for eight years under the eye of one J Hardie. It is also worth noting that Carillion\u2019s auditor, KPMG, and the other big accountants, are all members of the CBI. The Institute of Directors took the opposite approach. Ministers were \u201cright to criticise the failures\u201d at Carillion, said director of policy Edwin Morgan, as many in the business community had been \u201cappalled\u201d by the affair. The tone of the Carillion report may be edgy, but it is also refreshing. Its authors dispensed with the niceties, abstractions and caveats common to these documents. After such an ignominious scandal, members of the public want to hear what happened in plain English and, for once, that\u2019s what they got. If there is a reason not to invest in Britain, it isn\u2019t the language of the Carillion post-mortem, but the inadequacies of the directors, regulators, government and corporate culture that killed it. That needed saying. Corruption solutions start on the home front Corruption is a global tax on development. Tax havens are awash with cash that could and should be spent alleviating poverty in poor countries. Overseas demand for real estate in Belgravia or Manhattan is the other end of the dirty deals that siphon off cash that might otherwise be spent on health and education in the developing world. Knowing that corruption exists is one thing. Fighting it is altogether more difficult. That much is obvious from the new memoir, Fighting Corruption Is Dangerous by Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, who spent two spells as finance minister of Nigeria, trying to clean up the oil-rich country. Okonjo-Iweala had some successes in her anti-corruption drive. Modernising Nigeria\u2019s payments system, for example, rooted out more than 60,000 \u201cghost\u201d workers. But she made powerful enemies along the way and left office in 2015 with the job far from complete. Clearly, Nigeria is by no means the only country with a corruption problem, but should be considered a test case. If it can be cracked there, it can be cracked anywhere. So what needs to be done? While pressure from the International Monetary Fund can help, the fight against corruption is ultimately a domestic affair. Governments have to be up for the struggle, and they need a thought-through plan that can build and maintain a domestic coalition willing to take on vested interests. Leadership from the top is vital. So is a good communications strategy to keep the public on board. Fighting corruption requires strong institutions and administrative arrangements for tax collection, record keeping and law enforcement \u2013 things poor countries often lack. This is where outside help could make a difference. Okonjo-Iweala suggests that western countries could also offer paid fellowships to provide safety nets for those who take personal risks by exposing corruption. The IMF has also announced that it will monitor developed countries to ensure that their financial systems are not conduits for money laundering. The temptation is to think that eradicating corruption is about getting the good guys to take over from the bad. It is a bit more complex than that.",

      "body": "<p>The big story in the financial markets in 2018 has been the sharp rise in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/17/what-are-the-factors-driving-up-the-price-of-crude-oil\" title=\"\">oil prices, which last week hit $80 a barrel</a> for the first time in four years.</p> <p>But if oil analysts are right and the cost of crude is set to carry on rising, hitting $100 a barrel over the coming months, the big story of 2019 is going to be how oil came down to earth with a bump.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/17/what-are-the-factors-driving-up-the-price-of-crude-oil\" title=\"\">There are, without question, solid reasons for the oil price rises</a>. The global economy has been performing more strongly than expected, with almost every region doing its bit to push up demand. Donald Trump\u2019s tax cuts in the US and the reluctance of the Bank of Japan and the European Central Bank to tighten policy mean there is no immediate threat of recession.</p> <p>On the other side of the equation, supply has been kept in check. Part of this \u2013 the Opec production curbs \u2013 was planned. Other aspects of it \u2013 the chaos in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/03/venezuela-crisis-protests-nicolas-maduro-caracas\" title=\"\">Venezuela</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/08/iran-deal-trump-withdraw-us-latest-news-nuclear-agreement\" title=\"\">Donald Trump\u2019s decision to pull out of the Iran nuclear deal</a> \u2013 were not.</p> <p>As a result, there is no longer an oil glut as there was in the middle of the decade. If Iran is frozen out of the global oil market, other suppliers will eventually take up the slack. But it will take time for Opec members to ratchet up supply \u2013 even assuming that they decide to do so. The same applies to shale-oil producers in the US. Prices are going up because traders are speculating that demand for oil will exceed supply \u2013 and for now that looks like a reasonable assumption.</p> <p>But push things forward six or nine months and things look a bit different. Although the global economy seems healthy enough, it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/17/imf-global-recovery-protectionism-globalisation-growth\" title=\"\">has eased back since hitting a peak in the final months of 2017</a> and early 2018. Europe had a weaker-than-expected first quarter; China is clearly slowing down.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>US shale  oil is highly profitable at $80 a barrel, so production is bound to expand, and increase supply</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In the US, it is a different story. There, the economy is operating at close to full employment, investment is up and consumers are spending freely. But, in a classic case of the law of unintended consequences, any benefits Americans enjoy from Trump\u2019s tax cuts are soon going to be gobbled up by the higher fuel prices caused by the president\u2019s get-tough approach towards Iran.</p> <p>The Federal Reserve, America\u2019s central bank, is already thinking about raising interest rates three times before the end of this year, and is even more likely to act if it sees higher petrol and diesel prices pushing up inflation when the labour market is so tight.</p> <p>To be sure, there are reasons to think oil prices may hit $100 a barrel and carry on rising. With Trump in the White House, anything could happen. The Middle East could erupt into a full-scale conflict between Iran and Israel. The brittle detente between North Korea and the US could break down. In those circumstances, the cost of crude would stay higher for longer.</p> <p>But in the absence of a new geopolitical shock, oil prices will eventually start falling. In oil-importing countries, more expensive crude will eat in to the discretionary spending power of consumers, leading to weaker demand in 2019. This will happen just as the US public is starting to feel the impact of higher interest rates, and as the effects of the tax cuts are wearing off.</p> <p>On the supply side, two things will happen. First, US shale production \u2013 which is highly profitable with oil at $80 a barrel \u2013 will expand. Second, Opec producers will \u2013 whatever they say in public \u2013 quietly start to exceed their quotas in order to make up for the shortfall caused by sanctions on Iran.</p> <p>Demand for oil is going to fall while supply is going to rise. Markets do not always behave in the way the economics textbooks predict, but this time, they will.</p> <h2>MPs were right to give Carillion chiefs a roasting<br></h2> <p>The language of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/16/recklessness-hubris-and-greed-carillion-slammed-by-mps\" title=\"\">joint select committee report into the collapse of Carillion</a> was punchy, even bombastic. It told of \u201crecklessness, hubris and greed\u201d at the failed outsourcing firm, lamented a \u201crotten corporate culture\u201d and named and shamed three directors.</p> <p>The Confederation of British Industry was not impressed. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2018/may/16/carillion-report-rotten-corporate-culture-delusional-japan-economy-shrinks-markets-business-live?page=with:block-5afc3b34e4b0a1f83476d65b\" title=\"\">Deputy director general Josh Hardie complained that the report was irresponsible</a>, giving and gave the impression that British business in general was greedy and reckless. Such \u201cknee-jerk soundbites\u201d \u2013 as he described the choicest phrases \u2013 risked harming investment in Britain.</p> <p>Perhaps the criticisms struck a little too close to home. After all, Carillion was taken to task for its aggressive accounting, including booking revenues it had not yet pocketed. That\u2019s not a million miles away from the accounting scandal at Tesco, where corporate responsibility fell for eight years under the eye of one J Hardie. It is also worth noting that Carillion\u2019s auditor, KPMG, and the other big accountants, are all members of the CBI.</p> <p>The Institute of Directors took the opposite approach. Ministers were \u201cright to criticise the failures\u201d at Carillion, said director of policy Edwin Morgan, as many in the business community had been \u201cappalled\u201d by the affair.</p> <p>The tone of the Carillion report may be edgy, but it is also refreshing. Its authors dispensed with the niceties, abstractions and caveats common to these documents. After such an ignominious scandal, members of the public want to hear what happened in plain English and, for once, that\u2019s what they got.</p> <p>If there is a reason not to invest in Britain, it isn\u2019t the language of the Carillion post-mortem, but the inadequacies of the directors, regulators, government and corporate culture that killed it. That needed saying.</p> <h2>Corruption solutions start on the home front<br></h2> <p>Corruption is a global tax on development. Tax havens are awash with cash that could and should be spent alleviating poverty in poor countries. Overseas demand for real estate in Belgravia or Manhattan is the other end of the dirty deals that siphon off cash that might otherwise be spent on health and education in the developing&#xa0;world.</p> <p>Knowing that corruption exists is one thing. Fighting it is altogether more difficult. That much is obvious from the new memoir, <a href=\"https://www.guardianbookshop.com/fighting-corruption-is-dangerous.html\" title=\"\"><em>Fighting Corruption Is Dangerous</em></a> by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/ngozi-okonjo-iweala\" title=\"\">Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala,</a> who spent two spells as finance minister of Nigeria, trying to clean up the oil-rich country.</p> <p>Okonjo-Iweala had some successes in her anti-corruption drive. Modernising Nigeria\u2019s payments system, for example, rooted out more than 60,000 \u201cghost\u201d workers. But she made powerful enemies along the way and left office in 2015 with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/aug/09/people-have-a-lot-to-lose-nigeria-website-combat-corruption\" title=\"\">job far from complete.</a></p> <p>Clearly, Nigeria is by no means the only country with a corruption problem, but should be considered a test case. If it can be cracked there, it can be cracked anywhere.</p> <p>So what needs to be done? While pressure from the International Monetary Fund can help, the fight against corruption is ultimately a domestic affair. Governments have to be up for the struggle, and they need a thought-through plan that can build and maintain a domestic coalition willing to take on vested interests. Leadership from the top is vital. So is a good communications strategy to keep the public on board.</p> <p>Fighting corruption requires strong institutions and administrative arrangements for tax collection, record keeping and law enforcement \u2013 things poor countries often lack. This is where outside help could make a difference. Okonjo-Iweala suggests that western countries could also offer paid fellowships to provide safety nets for those who take personal risks by exposing corruption. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/22/city-faces-corruption-crackdown-as-imf-investigates-wealthy-countries\" title=\"\">The IMF has also announced that it will monitor developed countries to ensure that their financial systems are not conduits for money laundering</a>.</p> <p>The temptation is to think that eradicating corruption is about getting the good guys to take over from the bad. It is a bit more complex than that.</p>",

And \u2013 surprise, surprise \u2013 neither of the proposals supposedly being discussed is in any case considered remotely viable by most, indeed all, of the experts I have talked to.

The situation is so potentially dire that I often meet intelligent people who just cannot face hearing about Brexit \u2013 a development which may have something to do with an apparent decline in the audience for the Today programme, which commentators like myself have to listen to, however annoying it is that the presenters confuse the referendum result, which happened, with Brexit, which has not and one hopes never will.

It is abundantly clear that this dreadful government does not have a Plan B, or even a Plan A that might be rendered unsuccessful by a Plan B.

Now, mention of Farage reminds me of one of the more intriguing recent statements from another member of the Dishonourable Company of Brexiters.

Along with the majority of the Lords, and the more enlightened Tory and Labour MPs, Mr Hannan sees the advantages of access to the single market and the fallback position of Efta, the European Free Trade Association. But why bother? The Brexiters, and those who have caved in to them, keep trying to cherry-pick advantages, such as involvement in the Galileo navigation system, which are threatened by Brexit. But, as the EU\u2019s patient chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, says: \u201cWe are not kicking the UK out \u2026 The UK decided unilaterally and autonomously to withdraw from the EU. This implies leaving its programmes as well.\u201d The farce deepens. Recently the Department for International Trade had to appeal for funds from the Treasury. Why? Because it was cutting back on services that help our exports to tried and trusted markets in order to waste resources on trying to realise the trade secretary\u2019s fantasy of new agreements elsewhere.
