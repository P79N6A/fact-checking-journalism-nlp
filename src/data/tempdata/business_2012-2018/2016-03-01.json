      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s developers have been accused of increasing their profits from the UK\u2019s housing crisis by restricting the supply of new houses to keep prices artificially high. Latest figures reveal that nearly half a million homes in England now have planning permission granted but have yet to be built. The length of time it takes for developers to complete a house has jumped from 24 months to 32. It reignites a long-running row between policymakers and the housebuilding sector over who is to blame for the current housing shortage. While rates of planning permission for new homes have increased by 60% since 2010, there has been a 48% increase in the number of new homes being built. Labour MP Clive Betts, chair of the local government select committee, said the failure of the big housebuilders to speed up development was simply designed to maximise their profits. \u201cI think it is clear that the big developers are building at a rate to maximise their profits rather than addressing the country\u2019s housing need,\u201d he said. Betts said that some developments that have had planning permission were not due to be completed for another 10 years. He added: \u201cThese are private companies who are very simply trying to make money for their shareholders. They are restricting supply and the government urgently needs to come forward with measures to address this.\u201d Ministers are increasingly concerned by the failure of developers to speed up housebuilding. It has been reported that some senior Conservatives privately believe that some developers are deliberately restricting the supply of new houses to boost profits. Brandon Lewis, the housing minister, last week gave vent to his own frustrations with developers. \u201cWhen you have got housebuilders delivering, on average, 48 homes a year on some [large] sites that\u2019s not good enough,\u201d he told the local government committee. \u201cWe know they can go further. Housebuilders will talk about saturating the market. But we are aware that in too many places we are still taking 20 weeks to build a house when we can do it in three or four.\u201d Taylor Wimpey recently announced a record operating profit margin of more than 20% as it sold more homes at higher prices. Pre-tax profits at Barratt Homes, Britain\u2019s biggest housebuilder, have also jumped 40% in the last six months to nearly \u00a3300m. Ministers are understood to be contemplating new measures to force up the rate of development amid fears that they will fall short of their manifesto commitment to build 1m new homes by 2020. This could include forcing developers that buy publicly owned land to commit to rapid construction as part of the planning process. The housing industry analyst Glenigan compiled the latest data for the Local Government Association, which was released in January. It showed that 475,647 homes in England which have been given planning permission were yet to be built in 2014/2015. In 2012/13, the total of unimplemented planning permissions was 381,390 and in 2013/14 it was 443,265. A spokesman for the Home Builders Federation, which represents the industry, said the most recent government figures show there were 170,690 net additions to the housing stock during 2014/15, an increase of almost 25% on the previous year. \u201cThe industry has delivered unprecedented increases in supply over the past two years driven predominantly by the large private sector housebuilders,\u201d he said. \u201cThis has been on the back of the pro development policies introduced in recent years and a general increase in demand.\u201d He blamed the planning systems of local and central government for the shortfall in housing. \u201cAs a priority, it needs to work with local authorities to speed up the planning system and ensure local plans allocate enough sites of different types and sizes that are attractive to a range of companies,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "China\u2019s factories have stumbled through last month\u2019s new year celebrations to join a broad decline in manufacturing across Europe and the US, adding further evidence of sharp downturn in the global economy since the beginning of the year. Factory output contracted in China and the UK during February while growth slowed in France, Germany, Italy and the US to indicate that businesses and consumers remain wary of committing themselves to large orders while the direction of global trade remains uncertain. UK manufacturers, which cut jobs for the second month in a row, were among the worst hit following a tumble in monthly exports. In China, however, longstanding issues of oversupply, sky-high pollution levels and recent falls in demand could lead to a dramatic jobs cull. According to Reuters, the Chinese state plans to reduce the number of state workers in the country\u2019s bloated industrial sectors by up to 6 million. Starting with coal and steel, this will be done over the next two to three years. To limit the fallout, it is understood that the authorities will spend nearly 150bn yuan (\u00a316.4bn) to cover layoffs in just in these two sectors. With central banks preparing to spend billions to prevent deflation and a recession, markets remained calm. The FTSE pushed ahead 55 points to 6,152 on Tuesday, while the German Dax jumped more than 2%, or 221 points, to 9,717. The FTSE 100 is now back to its levels of the beginning of January, regaining almost all the ground lost in the record bad start to the year. US markets also shrugged off the stagnation of the nation\u2019s manufacturing sector, with the Dow Jones index of top companies up 273 points to 16,790. Investors believe the European Central Bank is poised to stretch its balance sheet further to bolster the eurozone economy after the disappointing manufacturing figures and inflation data. Headline inflation across the single currency zone dropped to -0.2% in February, down from 0.3% in the previous month. The Bank of Japan has already increased its stimulus package and the US Federal Reserve could reveal that a possible interest rate rise later this month will be put off until a recovery is well established and output begins to rise strongly. China\u2019s manufacturing output declined for a fifth month to push the Caixin reading down to a five-month low of 48.0, versus 48.4 in January. The official manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) came in at 49.0, below Reuters\u2019 average forecast of 49.3 and January\u2019s reading of 49.4. A figure below 50 indicates contraction. \u201cCompanies that reported lower output generally cited weak market conditions and reduced intakes of new work. Furthermore, total new business declined for the eighth month in a row, albeit at a modest pace that was similar to January,\u201d said the Caixin financial media group, which publishes the general China manufacturing PMI survey with financial information service provider Markit. Analysts expressed concern about the continued decline in total new business and about the number of goods on factory warehouse shelves decreasing at the fastest pace since September 2011. In another sign that manufacturers are braced for a long period of chasing business from a diminishing number of customers, they continued to lower their prices in February. Bill Adams, senior international economist at PNC Financial Services Group, said the global economy would avoid recession, though only after the timely intervention of central banks. \u201cMonetary policy is highly accommodative around the world, and very low oil prices are supporting consumer demand. Nevertheless, the decline in China\u2019s headline business sentiment indicators in February, and the parallel declines in flash PMI releases for other major economies, suggest that increased vigilance toward global growth risks may be appropriate in the near term,\u201d he said. Moody\u2019s gave added weight to forecasts of a long wait before an upturn with a prediction for 2016. Sharon Ou, a senior credit officer at the ratings agency, said a sharp increase in the number of businesses defaulting on their loans and a rash of profit warnings, which are often the first sign of businesses getting into trouble, have heightened concerns that this year would be the worst for corporate collapses since the 2008 crash. \u201cPersistently low commodity prices, slowing economic expansion and widening high-yield spreads will send default rates higher in 2016,\u201d she said. \u201cThe prospect of further interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve could also lead investors to become even more risk-averse.\u201d The default rate for all corporate bond issuers rated by Moody\u2019s is expected to rise to 2.1% in 2016, a 30% increase on last year. The prospect of a sharp increase in defaults could be seen as the first step in governments allowing so-called \u201czombie companies\u201d going to the wall. But investors are unlikely to welcome a rise in bankruptcies and become more reluctant to deploy their funds for investment, leaving a bigger gap for central banks to fill.",

      "bodyText": "No firm that has just swung from a profit of $4.2bn (\u00a33bn) to a loss of $8bn can claim to be out of the woods \u2013 especially if net debt stands at $26bn. For all that, the picture at Glencore looks less dreadful than it did six months ago. The miner\u2019s trading and marketing division chipped in top-line earnings of $2.5bn, down only 12%, suggesting its chief, Ivan Glasenberg, was right about the resilience of the old part of Glencore\u2019s empire. Actual mining, of course, was a different story: top-line earnings fell 38% to $6bn, but then came a mass of impairment charges, restructuring costs and losses on disposals. But cashflow is king for miners these days and Glasenberg was able to boast the company can be \u201ccomfortably cash generative at current and even lower commodity prices\u201d. Jolly good, but a little humility would be in order given that the share price, even after a recovery of sorts, is still 75% below the float price of 2011. Instead, Glasenberg gave another airing to his line about taking \u201cearly and decisive action\u201d in challenging markets. This is nonsense. A company taking early action would not have launched a $1bn share buy-back in autumn 2014, squandering the cash on overpriced shares before, in effect, asking shareholders for the money to be returned via a placing in autumn 2015. That little detail seems to have been airbrushed already. Hit Paddy Power in the FOBTs Paddy Power encouraged a problem gambler to use its fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs) until he lost five jobs, his home and access to his children, according to a report this week. The details of the case, one of three \u201cserious failings\u201d at the bookmaker recorded by the Gambling Commission, are extraordinary. The penalty wasn\u2019t.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Mining and trading company Glencore has plunged to an $8bn (\u00a35.7bn) loss in 2015 after the commodities slump took its toll on the sector. The loss came after a $4.2bn profit a year earlier and covers 2015 \u2013 a year in which the FTSE 100 company endured a turbulent ride on the stock market. Its shares slumped to below 70p at the height of the concerns about the Chinese slowdown and anxiety about the company\u2019s debt levels. After it unveiled the loss, shares in the Swiss-based but London-listed company were initially down 4% before ending Tuesday 2% lower at 130p. The shares were floated at 530p at in 2011. Like other miners, the company has been hit hard by the collapse in commodity prices linked to slowing demand from China. Glencore has slashed production of zinc, coal, copper and oil as well as cutting investment and costs, including jobs. It has sold off $1.6bn of assets and tried to win the confidence of the City by saying it was confident of achieving a further $4bn-$5bn of asset sales this year. Ivan Glasenberg, Glencore\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cOur rigorous focus on debt reduction, supply discipline and cost efficiencies enabled Glencore to record a robust performance in difficult market conditions. \u201cFinancial market sentiment weakened considerably during the course of 2015, amid concerns over slowing economic growth. \u201cThe commodity sector was particularly adversely affected by a succession of disappointing China macroeconomic data, declining oil prices, and the strong US dollar and, as a result, sector focus quickly switched from cash distribution to balance sheet concerns and cash preservation. \u201cThis led to further industry-wide cost and capex [capital expenditure] reductions, project closures and curtailments, asset sales, dividend cuts and equity issuance.\u201d Ten people lost their lives at Glencore operations during the year. The company halted dividends after last year\u2019s interim payout in an attempt to hold on to its credit ratings, vital to support its marketing division with cheap finance. There will be no payment to shareholders this year although a payment could be resumed next year. \u201c2017 is going to be very much open to deliberations,\u201d Steven Kalmin, finance director, told Bloomberg. \u201cAt some point in time, you get your debt levels down to a reasonable level, you\u2019re generating $3bn-plus of cashflow, then clearly the ability to both make and sustain distributions at some point from a position of strength is going to be on the agenda.\u201d Glasenberg said the debt reduction measures taken so far have contributed to its current stable credit rating and he plans to have net debt down to between $17bn and $18bn this year compared with $26bn at the end of 2015. The company took exceptional charges of $5.8bn related to impairments, restructuring costs and losses on asset sales. Adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation and other deductibles fell 32% to $8.69bn, which was in line with analysts\u2019 forecasts. Analysts at Bernstein said investors had misunderstood the marketing unit \u2013 the trading division. They said: \u201cSome of the market panic seen in the fourth quarter of last year was caused by fears that the trading business would collapse with lower commodity prices. Today\u2019s results show how misguided this theory was. \u201cThe marketing unit thrives with high volumes and some volatility and does not need high commodity prices.\u201d China announced on Monday that it would lay off 1.8 million workers in its coal and steel industries, or about 15% of the sector\u2019s workforce, as part of efforts to reduce industrial overcapacity.",

The baker\u2019s decision to offer healthier options, including soups and salads, has helped drive a 25% rise in pre-tax profits for 2015. Britain\u2019s biggest bakery chain, which counts the Hollywood actor Jake Gyllenhaal among its fans, said its Balanced Choice range of healthier products with less than 400 calories accounted for 10% of total sales last year. Other lower calorie options include pasta salads, flatbreads and porridge. Greggs has also launched a \u201cheat-to-eat\u201d sandwich range and extended its breakfast menu to include free-range egg omelette, as well as introducing no added sugar soft drinks, tapping into the growing food-on-the-go market. This all helped the Newcastle-based firm to increase pre-tax profits excluding one-off items by more than 25% to \u00a373m last year. Total sales climbed more than 5% to \u00a3835.7m, while like-for-like sales \u2013 which exclude gains from new stores \u2013 were 4.7% higher. The baker was the biggest riser on the FTSE 250, with its shares closing up more than 15% at \u00a312, as the company lifted its dividend for 2015 to 28.6p from 22p in 2014.

Indeed, markets seemed to be more focus on the prospect of more central bank stimulus ahead to boost sluggish global economies or, in the case of the Federal Reserve, a delay in any planned interest rate rise. Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct, said: That\u2019s certainly been a solid start to the month\u2019s trade, with the FTSE-100 putting in another impressive day of gains although with downbeat PMI data out of China - and indeed the UK \u2013 it\u2019s difficult not to be left thinking that the upside has come about only at the expense of promised further stimulus measures. A strong performance from the oil price helped, with Brent crude currently up 1.2% to $37.04 a barrel. The final scores on the European markets were: The FTSE 100 finished 55.79 points or 0.92% higher at 6152.88, its highest leel since 31 December last year Germany\u2019s Dax was up 2.34% at 9717.16 France\u2019s Cac climbed 1.22% to 4406.84 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB rose 2.21% to 18,011.91 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 1.77% at 8611.0 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.65% to 520.08 On Wall Street, ahead of the Super Tuesday US delegate voting, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 300 points or 1.8% higher. On that note, it\u2019s time to close the blog. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Using the closing prices, also likely to be demoted from the FTSE 100 are Smiths Group, Hikma Pharmaceuticals and Aberdeen Asset Managment. The four replacements as things stand would be Paddy Power Betfair after its merger, hospitals group Mediclinic following a reverse takeover, Morrisons after it was relegated in December at the last review, and Investec. Again, the moves need to be ratified by the FTSE committee on Wednesday. Mike Ashley\u2019s Sports Direct International is being relegated from the FTSE 100 following a Guardian investigation. The demotion is based on tonight\u2019s closing price of 410p, down 40% since December, and will be confirmed officially by a committee at index compilers FTSE on Wednesday. Full story here: The Draghi comments come from a letter sent today in reply to MEP Jonas Fern\u00e1ndez. ECB president Mario Draghi has added fuel to the expectations that the central bank will unveil further stimulus measures at this month\u2019s meeting. He said the euro area inflation dynamics continued to be weaker than expected, and there are increased risks to the bank\u2019s earlier outlook, according to Reuters. The agency reports him saying \u201cthere are no limits to how far we are willing to deploy our instruments within our mandate to achieve our objective of inflation rates below,k but close to, 2% over the medium term.\u201d Here\u2019s a handy round-up of the day\u2019s PMIs: Not exactly a convincing recovery is the view of Rob Carnell, chief international economist at ING Bank, on the ISM figures: The February Institute of Supply Management (ISM ) manufacturing index rose to 49.5 from 47.8 in January. This means that manufacturing is likely to be expanding at a slightly stronger pace than it was in January. But slightly stronger is still a long way from robust. Typically, we see an index of 50 or above as necessary to indicate growth at an acceptable rate, whilst 43.2 is the historical break-even index for contraction or expansion. One key element of this release, which always happens the same week as the US labour report, is the employment index. This also rose, reaching 48.5 from a very soft 45.9 in January. But like the headline index, it remains deep in \u201ccontraction\u201d territory, albeit marginally less so than in January. Moreover, as a guide to payrolls, this is not very reliable. Despite the weak January employment index, January manufacturing payrolls employment actually rose by 29,000, its highest since November 2014. On a more positive note, new orders remained positive at a respectable 51.5. Markets will no doubt see this survey as a positive release, an excuse for stocks to rally and bond yields to rise. But in truth, this is another mixed survey, and not terribly reliable at that. We do not see it as sufficiently robust to warrant the Federal Reserve raising rates again at its March meeting. Here are some of the respondents comments to the ISM: \u201cLow oil prices and reduced activity continue affecting our business.\u201d (Petroleum &amp; Coal Products) \u201cU.S. business demand is solid; international demand is soft.\u201d (Chemical Products) \u201cMobility spend is up.\u201d (Computer &amp; Electronic Products) \u201cBusiness has to get better. And it appears it is. Healthy backlog for 2016.\u201d (Fabricated Metal Products) \u201cVery strong demand for product. Material availability very good and commodity pricing continues to be depressed.\u201d (Machinery) \u201cAirlines are still ordering planes and spare parts for plane galleys.\u201d (Transportation Equipment) \u201cMarket is beginning to trend up with spring season on its way.\u201d (Wood Products) \u201cNot seeing impact from global economic volatility or oil prices. Business is strong and growth projections remain the same.\u201d (Miscellaneous Manufacturing) \u201cOrders are coming in stronger than expected.\u201d (Furniture &amp; Related Products) \u201cStill a bit sluggish.\u201d (Food, Beverage &amp; Tobacco Products) The Federal Reserve\u2019s dilemma: David Morrison at Spread Co said: The US ISM Manufacturing PMI beat the consensus expectation by quite a distance. Nevertheless, it wasn\u2019t enough to register expansion in a sector which has been declining for over a year now. Earlier today China\u2019s Manufacturing PMIs continued to show contraction in the sector. On top of that, there was an unwelcome dip in the country\u2019s Non-Manufacturing PMI as well, suggesting that the hoped-for rebalancing from manufacturing and exporting to consumer demand may not be going as well as hoped. Manufacturing data from across the eurozone and UK was also generally disappointing. Add in yesterday\u2019s weak US Chicago PMI and Pending Home Sales, together with the year-on-year Euro zone CPI print of -0.3% and you have plenty of evidence that the global economic outlook isn\u2019t exactly glowing. Of course, what this all means for central bank-fixated investors is that further stimulus can\u2019t be far away. Stock market bulls must be praying for a bad US payroll number on Friday to really kibosh the fear of further Fed rate hikes this side of summer. US construction spending is also stronger: And by contrast with the Markit PMI, the manufacturing activity index from the Institute for Supply Management has come in higher than expected. The index came in at 49.5 in February, up from 48.2 in the previous month and better than the 48.5 forecast. This is the highest level since September. The new orders index was flat at 51.5 and the employment index was much stronger than the expected 46.4, coming in at 48.5. Despite the better than expected data, the ISM index still shows a sector in contraction since the figure is below 50. More fuel to the idea that the Federal Reserve will be in no hurry to raise interest rates again. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit said: The February data add to signs of distress in the US manufacturing economy. Production and order book growth continues to worsen, led by falling exports. Jobs are being added at a slower pace and output prices are dropping at a rate not seen since mid-2012. The deterioration in the manufacturing sector\u2019s performance since mid-2014 has broadly tracked the dollar\u2019s rise, which makes US goods more expensive in overseas markets and leads US consumers to favour cheaper imported goods. With other headwinds including the downturn in the oil sector, heightened uncertainty due to financial market volatility, global growth worries and growing concerns about the presidential election, it\u2019s no surprise that the manufacturing sector is facing its toughest period since the global financial crisis. US manufacturing performed marginally better than expected in February but worse than in January. The Markit manufacturing purchasing managers index came in at 51.3 last month, higher than the initial estimate of 51 and the forecast of 51.2. But it was down on the final figure for January of 52.4. The same pattern was seen in the employment index, which at 51.8 was better than the initial estimate of 51.5 but lower than January\u2019s 52.8. The output index at 51.8 was the lowest since October 2013. Ahead of the US manufacturing figures for February - remember there is the Markit PMI followed shortly afterwards by the ISM survey - Wall Street has climbed sharply in early trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 93 points or 0.6% while the S&amp;P 500 has opened up 0.5% and Nasdaq up 0.8%, as the oil price shows signs of stabilising. Time for a very quick summary. Britain\u2019s factory sector has posted its slowest growth in almost three years. UK manufacturers have been hurt by the weakening global economy and signs of domestic slowdown, and economists fear further problems ahead. Growth across the eurozone\u2019s manufacturing sector hit a one-year low. Germany and France saw near-stagnation, and firms reported renewed price pressure - a day after the eurozone fell back into deflation. The Eurozone jobless rate has hit a new four and a half-year low. In January, 10.3% of workers were unemployed, around twice the levels in the US and UK. China got the day off to a bad start, with factory activity shrinking again. Analysts say it puts more pressure on Beijing to take further measures to stave off severe economic problems. The financial markets have taken the news well; shares are up across Europe, and the US expected to follow. But there are new signs of unease in the markets, as Japan sells 10-year bonds at a negative yield for the first time ever. Barclays shares have slumped by 10% as investors balk at falling profits and a dividend cut. The London Stock Exchange could be the centre of a tug-of-war, as the owner of the New York stock exchange ponders launching a rival takeover bid. The financial market turmoil of 2015 has knocked around \u00a350bn off the value of the world\u2019s 20 wealthiest people. That\u2019s according to the annual survey of the megarich from Forbes , which reports that Carlos Slim, the Mexican telecoms tycoon, had a year to forget. His fortune shrank from $77.1bn to $50bn last year. Bill Gates also became a little poorer, but Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg bucked the trend. My colleague Graham Ruddick has read the report, and explains: Bill Gates has been crowned the richest man in the world for the third year in a row, although the Microsoft founder\u2019s fortune also dipped from $79.2bn to $75bn. Zuckerberg\u2019s wealth grew by $11.2bn to give him a total net worth of $44.6bn. Zuckerberg is the sixth richest person in the world, behind Jeff Bezos, the Amazon founder, Slim, investor Warren Buffett, Amancio Ortega, the businessman behind the Zara fashion empire, and Gates. Here comes the first slug of economic data from across the Atlantic.... and it show that Brazil\u2019s factory sector shrank at a rapid pace in February. The Brazilian manufacturing PMI, which measures activity at hundreds of firms, fell to a three-month low of 44.5 in February, from 47.4 in January. That\u2019s the second-fastest contraction since the financial crisis in 2008. And firms also saw their costs jump, due to the weakening Brazilian currency. Markit explains: Brazil\u2019s manufacturing recession extended to February, with a further drop in incoming new work leading companies to lower production and cut jobs again. Such was the extent of the downturn that firms shed jobs at the second-fastest pace since April 2009. The weaker real continued to exert upward pressure on input costs, which rose at quickest rate since October 2008. Subsequently, tariffs were raised again, with charge inflation reaching a survey peak. It\u2019s a historic day in the financial markets. For the first time ever, investors have paid Japan for the privilege of lending to it for the next decade. That\u2019s because Japan auctioned 10-year bonds at an interest rate, or yield, of below zero for the first time ever. That means investors agreed to pay more than the face value of the bonds, which Tokyo will repay in 2026. The FT says that Japan has crossed a \u201cfinancial rubicon\u201d; it makes it the first G7 nation to sell 10-year bonds so cheaply. You might think this would be welcome -- government deficits sound less scary when you can borrow for free. But in this case, it means investors are pessimistic about growth and inflation prospects. It also shows the adverse consequences of negative interest rates, which the Bank of Japan imposed last month. Banks lose money on funds left at the BoJ, so they may as well buy 10-year bonds at a small loss instead. But with asset yields so low, it\u2019s going to be even harder for banks to generate profits. And could Germany be next? Ten-year bunds are yielding just 0.13% today.... It\u2019s lunchtime in the City of London, after a morning of generally downbeat economic news. But shares are still up, though. The FTSE 100 has gained 45 points or 0.75% to a two-month high. The prospect of a bidding war has driven London Stock Exchange Group up 8.5% to the top of the leader board. But Barclays has lost 9% to a three-year low, with traders disappointed by today\u2019s results. The Stoxx 600, which tracks the 600 largest listed European companies, is at a one-month high. Investors simply aren\u2019t panicking about the weakness in the world\u2019s factory sectors that we\u2019ve seen today. Instead, they may be cheered by the oil price. US crude is up 1.7% today at $34.33. Joshua Mahoney of IG explains: European markets have a spring in their step this morning, with the FTSE hitting an eight-week high in early trade. The initial anxiety brought about by yet another batch of disappointing Chinese PMI readings overnight proved unfounded, as the slowdown story begins to play less of a role in global sentiment. Wall Street is expected to turn green at the open too. Wondering where you should have invested your hard-earned money (or your clients\u2019) last month? Deutsche Bank has the answer. You should have piled into gold on February 1st, when bullion was $1,128 per ounce. It\u2019s now $1,245 per ounce, up 10%. If you fancied some FX action, buying the yen against the US dollar would have been profitable too (it strengthened from \u00a5121 to \u00a5113 to the $1). And you should have steered well away from wheat. It was the worst performing asset class, amid predictions of decent harvests and ample suppliers. The second worst - the Greek stock market, which slumped in the face of deadlock between the Athens government and its creditors over its latest bailout plan. Legal &amp; General, the UK\u2019s biggest asset manager, has just issued a statement on Britain\u2019s In-Out EU referendum, scheduled for June 23. L&amp;G believes its business would suffer little impact of the UK public vote to leave the European Union, as it has relatively few customers on the continent. However, it also warns that a Brexit vote would probably have some negative effect on the financial markets, and the real economy. L&amp;G says: We consider that a vote to leave would have little direct impact on trading for Legal &amp; General: our customer base is located very largely in the UK, the US and Asia. It is however probable that a vote to exit, with a potentially lengthy period of negotiation and an uncertain outcome, would create uncertainty for markets and the broader UK economy in which we operate. L&amp;G also warns that there is a lack of clarity over the new trade links which Britain would forge after Brexit, and that \u201cthe economic case for leaving is unproven\u201d. So it will keep the issue under review. As one of the largest investors in the UK, we will be actively listening to companies we invest in, who will be assessing the potential impact for themselves. So, quite a balanced view from L&amp;G, who don\u2019t seem terribly alarmed about Brexit. And Juliet Samuel of the Wall Street Journal thinks she knows why.... Alan Greenspan was notoriously opaque when he was the world\u2019s top central banker, joking once that \u201cIf I seem unduly clear to you, you must have misunderstood what I said.\u201d But the former Federal Reserve chairman has developed a new line in clarity in his older year. Greenspan, who turns 90 on Sunday, has sat down with Bloomberg to talk about the global economy. And he criticised the new vogue towards negative interest rates, as central bankers Asked if charging banks a negative interest rate was dangerous, Greenspan said: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say dangerous, but it is clearly not productive.\u201d \u201cThe big argument about excessively low interest rates for a very long period of time is that it warps the investment pattern on real investments.\u201d [As interest rates fall, so does the rate of return which banks get on their assets. However, in a negative interest rate world they cannot keep cutting the cost of their liabilities - customer deposits - without charging savers] Greenspan also warned that \u201cwe\u2019re in trouble\u201d because \u201cproductivity is dead in the water\u201d. Output per hour is driven essentially by real capital investment, and it\u2019s way below average, because business people are very uncertain about the future. More here: Greenspan Says Negative Rates `Warp\u2019 Investment Behavior The sharp slowdown in UK factory growth last month has disappointed analysts. They are worried that domestic demand weakened in February, compounding the impact of weaker demand from overseas. And the EU referendum could weigh on the sector for several months too. Here\u2019s some early reaction: Zach Witton, Deputy Chief Economist at EEF, the manufacturers\u2019 organisation \u201cAfter an encouraging start to 2016, the manufacturing PMI took a turn for the worse in February, falling to its lowest level in nearly three years and barely remaining in growth territory. \u201cActivity levels deteriorated on the back of weakness in new orders, with domestic demand no longer compensating for lacklustre export orders. The weakness led manufacturing to post job losses for the fifth time in the last seven months. On a brighter note, the weakness was not across the board as new orders for intermediate goods edged higher. Manufacturers face a challenging environment, with subdued demand from emerging markets and the ongoing weakness of the oil price weighing heavily on companies in the oil and gas supply chain. Against this backdrop, manufacturers will be looking at the forthcoming Budget and will want to see the Chancellor avoid adding significant costs at a time when business conditions are tough.\u201d Mike Rigby, head of manufacturing at Barclays \u201cThe weak start to the year continues for the manufacturing sector with even domestic demand unable to contribute to the levels it has done previously. However, amidst the headwinds of slowing global growth, uncertainty over a Brexit and skills shortages in the industry comes the recent depreciation in sterling which may just provide the jump-start that manufacturing exporters need to boost exports and put a spark back into the sector\u2019s performance.\u201d Kallum Pickering of Berenberg Bank. Domestic demand has been the key driver of UK manufacturing in recent months. But with households showing some Brexit jitters too, UK manufacturing might be heading for a rough time until the referendum is out of the way. As long as the UK votes to stay in the EU, domestic demand will likely pick up again thereafter. If the UK votes to eject itself from its biggest market, things may get much rougher, though. The unemployment rate across the eurozone has hit its lowest level since August 2011, the early months of the debt crisis. The eurozone jobless rate ticked down to 10.3% in January 2016, down from 10.4% in December 2015, for the first time since August 2011. That continues the slow recovery since April 2013, when the euro area jobless rate hit 12.3%. But it\u2019s still far too high, especially in Greece and Spain where around one in four are out of work. In the wider EU, the jobless rate dropped to 8.9% from 9.0% - the lowest in over six years. UK factories do have one glimmer of hope -- the recent slump in the pound. Today\u2019s report was conducted before Brexit firms sent sterling down to new seven-year lows, which ought to help exporters.... Barclays shares are being hammered harder, after it reported an 8% fall in profits, halved its dividend and warned of further job cuts. They fell 11% a moment ago, forcing trading to be briefly suspended. More gloom! Britain\u2019s factories have posted their slowest growth in almost three years, as the nation\u2019s manufacturing sector slipped to near-stagnation. Data firm Markit\u2019s monthly healthcheck of the sector showed that output slowed sharply, as exports suffered from weakness in the global economy. Firms struggled to attract new business and cut jobs for the second month running. Rob Dobson of Markit says UK firms are being forced to cut prices to attract business, due to weak demand at home and abroad. \u201cThe near-stagnation of manufacturing highlights the ongoing fragility of the economic recovery at the start of the year and provides further cover for the Bank of England\u2019s increasingly dovish stance. \u201cThe breadth of the slowdown is especially worrisome. The domestic market is showing signs of weakening while export business continued to fall. Price pressures also remained firmly on the downside, with the survey signalling input costs falling at a double-digit annual pace and average factory gate selling prices showing a further decline. A lot of this is driven by the ongoing weakness of global commodity prices. However, there are also signs that weaker growth is driving up competition between manufacturers to secure new business and among their suppliers too. European stock markets are taking today\u2019s weak manufacturing data in their stride. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 just touched its highest point since the 5th of January, with mining group Anglo American and fashion chain Burberry among the risers. The Footsie is currently up 0.35% at 6117 points, also helped by the bid battle over the London Stock Exchange (up 7%). That means the London market has clawed back almost all the losses suffered in the great market turmoil in the first few weeks of this year. Germany\u2019s DAX has gained 1%, and the French CAC is 0.2% higher. Investors may be concluding that the weak manufacturing data will prompt another bout of stimulus measures from the world\u2019s central banks. It\u2019s official: Europe\u2019s manufacturing sector expanded at the slowest rate in a year last month, fuelling fears that its economy is heading into trouble. The latest Purchasing Managers Index reports, based on data from thousands of firms, shows that the eurozone\u2019s factory sector only expanded modestly. Markit\u2019s eurozone factory PMI hit a 12-month low of 51.2, down from 52.3 in January, dragged down by weakness in the two largest euro economies. Today\u2019s report shows that:\uf0a7 Slower growth of production, new orders, export business and employment France and Germany hover close to stagnation mark; Greece slips back into contraction Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, says the eurozone faces the threat of sluggish growth in 2016, or a full-blown downturn. \u201cLacklustre domestic demand is being compounded by a worsening global picture. Exports either fell or rose more slowly in all countries surveyed with the sole exception of Austria. \u201cFor a region in desperate need of lower unemployment, the near-stalling of jobs growth in the manufacturing sector comes as disappointing news. Firms are cutting back on their hiring due to worries about the outlook. \u201cPrices are meanwhile being dropped as firms endeavour to boost sales, suggesting deflationary pressures have intensified. Input prices are falling at a rate not seen since July 2009. \u201cWith all indicators \u2013 from output and demand to employment and prices \u2013 turning down, the survey will add pressure on the ECB to act quickly and aggressively to avert another economic downturn.\u201d Growth in Germany\u2019s factory sector has ground to a near-halt, according to Markit. The German manufacturing PMI slowed sharply to 50.5, a 15-month low, from 52.3 in January. New orders, and new exports, both dipped to the slowest growth since last summer. France\u2019s manufacturers remained in near-stagnation last month. The French PMI came in at 50.2, up from 50.0 in January - which showed no growth at all. Companies interviewed by Markit reported a drop in new business, and deflationary pressures. Markit economist Jack Kennedy says: \u201cFalling new orders were again the source of weakness, leading firms to cut production levels slightly. Meanwhile, the survey\u2019s price indices point to continued downward pressure on already low inflation.\u201d Italy\u2019s factory sector didn\u2019t enjoy a great February. The Italian manufacturing PMI has fallen to 52.2, from 53.2 in January. That\u2019s the lowest reading in a year, signalling that growth last month. New orders also rose at the slowest pace since February 2015. The first European PMI reports are out. The Dutch manufacturing sector has reported its slowest growth in 18 months, with the PMI dropping to 51.7 from 52.4. And Spain\u2019s factory PMI has dipped to 54.1, from 55.4. That\u2019s a solid growth rate, and is the 27th month of expansion in a row. Chinese investors have taken today\u2019s weak factory data in their stride. The Shanghai composite index closed 1.7% higher, on hopes that Beijing will heed calls for more stimulus measures. Back to China....and Beijing is reportedly planning to cut up to six million workers from failing companies. The sackings are part of the government\u2019s attempts to clear out its economy and remove excess capacity. Reuters has the story: China aims to lay off 5-6 million workers from \u201czombie enterprises\u201d over the next two to three years as part of efforts to curb industrial overcapacity and pollution, two sources with ties to the country\u2019s leadership said. Beijing is trying to rejuvenate its flagging economy by streamlining bloated industrial sectors, starting with coal and steel, but layoffs have emerged as one of the biggest concerns for cash-strapped regions ahead of next week\u2019s annual session of parliament. The government\u2019s plans to lay off five million workers in industries suffering from a supply glut would be the country\u2019s boldest retrenchment programme in almost two decades, one source said. The restructuring of state-owned enterprises from 1998 to 2003 led to around 28 million redundancies and cost the central government about 73.1 billion yuan ($11.2 billion) in resettlement funds. A second source with leadership ties put the number of layoffs at six million. Both sources requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to media about the politically sensitive subject for fear of sparking social unrest. Few things get our blood pumping faster than a takeover battle. And we might have one brewing, over the London Stock Exchange. Shares in the LSE have soared by 8% in early trading, after rival US operator Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) said it was considering a bid for the LSE. That would put ICE, which owns the New York stock exchagne, toe-to-toe against Germany\u2019s Deutsche B\u00f6rse, which announced plans for a \u2018merger of equals\u2019 with the LSE last week. ICE has released a statement, confirming it is considering a bid for the LSE, which was enough to get the shares motoring: Shares in Barclays have shed 4% at the start of trading, as traders give their verdict to today\u2019s results. The bank is briefing reporters now: Russia\u2019s factory sector continued to deteriorate last month. The Russian manufacturing PMI fell to 49.3 in February, down from 49.8 in January, showing a sharper slowdown. Data firm Markit warned that Russian factories cut jobs again, as Western sanctions and the oil price slump drives the economy towards recession: Disappointingly for goods producers, scrutinising the survey data leaves little encouraging news. Workforce numbers continued to slide while outstanding business was depleted at a sharp pace. Barclays has hit investors with some bad news. The bank is more than halving its dividend, from 6.5p to 3p, after suffering and 8% drop in pre-tax profits. Jill Treanor reports: Chief executive Jes Staley, making his first announcement since taking the helm in December, said he was \u201cannouncing initiatives to accelerate our strategy and simplify the group\u201d as profits fell 8% to \u00a32.1bn in 2015. Staley said the bank would reduce its stake in its African business - which expanded in 2005 when it bought South African bank Absa - and reduce its payout to shareholders. Here\u2019s the full story: Bloomberg\u2019s Caroline Hyde reckons traders won\u2019t be impressed. Dr. He Fan, Chief Economist at Caixin Insight Group, says today\u2019s PMI report shows that Beijing needs to take more action, fast. \u201cThe Caixin China General Manufacturing PMI for February is 48, down 0.4 points from the previous month. The index readings for all key categories including output, new orders and employment signalled that conditions worsened, in line with signs that the economy\u2019s road to stability remains bumpy. The government needs to press ahead with reforms, while adopting moderate stimulus policies and strengthening support of the economy in other ways to prevent it from falling off a cliff.\u201d Dr Gerard Lyons, economics advisor to London Mayor Boris Johnson, says it shows why the People\u2019s Bank of China eased monetary policy yesterday (by allowing banks to hold less funds in reserve): Chris Weston of IG agrees that the Chinese economy is getting worse: Chinese PMIs were predictably weak and while no doubt affected by the seasonal disruptions of Chinese Lunar New Year (LNY), the trend of late was pointing to further weakness in any case. In the NBS Manufacturing PMI, the key components of output and new orders both wilted dramatically. Probably of most concern was the renewed collapse in the small companies component, which contracted to 44.4. This emphasises the fact that despite the huge growth in credit in January, most of it is going to the large state-connected corporates while small and medium sized private enterprises continue to struggle. Confusingly, China actually has two PMI reports -- the Caixin one which is so gloomy this month, and a separate survey conducted by the government. And that official PMI confirms that the factory sector shrank last month: The Financial Times has the details: China\u2019s official manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 index fell to 49 in February from 49.8 in January, equalling its weakest since February 2009 and the seventh straight month of decline. The National Bureau of Statistics, which released the measure, said this was partly due to seasonal effects of the lunar new year holiday, when many factories shut down for extended periods to allow workers to travel to distant hometowns to spend time with their families. The official services sector PMI, which had previously held up better than the manufacturing index in China\u2019s economic slowdown, also slipped last month to 52.7, its weakest level since December 2008. China\u2019s economy has suffered another jolt, with its manufacturing sector shrinking at a faster pace and cutting jobs at the fastest rate since the depths of the financial crisis. It\u2019s a bad start to PMI Day, painting a pretty grim picture of the world\u2019s second-largest economy. Data firm Caixin reports that China\u2019s factory sector contracted at the fastest pace in five months. Its Purchasing Managers Index, based on data from hundreds of companies, fell to 48.0 in February, down from 48.4 in January. Any reading below 50 shows a contraction, so this shows that the operating conditions faced by Chinese goods producers continued to deteriorate in February. Output and total new orders shrank at a faster rate, and companies slashed staff at the fastest pace since January 2009 -- shortly after the failure of Lehman Brothers. It highlights that Chinese policymakers are still battling against a hard landing, with serious implications for the global economy too. Reaction to follow.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u2019s a big day for economic data, which should give new clues into the health of the world economy. A string of new Purchasing Managers Index surveys will show how the world\u2019s factory sector fared in February, from Asia to Europe to the US. Analysts will be scrutinising them for signs that growth weakened last month, in the face of financial market turbulence and the slowdown in China. We get the main eurozone data between 8.15am and 9am GMT, then the UK at 9.30am, followed by the US around 3pm. The expectations aren\u2019t great, as Michael Hewson of CMC Markets explains: Today\u2019s latest February manufacturing PMI numbers from Spain, Italy, France and Germany are expected to reinforce concerns of a gradual manufacturing slowdown, with both the German and French measures expected to show stagnation. The latest UK manufacturing PMI numbers are expected to show further weakness, down from 52.9 to 52.3, though recent sterling weakness might help on the margins. In the US we can expect to see further weakness in the latest ISM manufacturing numbers after a really soft February Chicago PMI manufacturing number yesterday. The sharp jump seen in January saw a sharp reverse to 47.6, with all major components also showing some worrying weakness. Also coming up.... New eurozone unemployment data is released at 10am GMT. It\u2019s likely to show that the jobless remained at around 10.4% in January, underlining the weak European recovery. And on the corporate front, Barclays bank, commodity trading firm Glencore and high street pasty chain Greggs are reporting results. We\u2019ll be covering all the main events through the day....",

This means that manufacturing is likely to be expanding at a slightly stronger pace than it was in January.</p> <p>But slightly stronger is still a long way from robust. Typically, we see an index of 50 or above as necessary to indicate growth at an acceptable rate, whilst 43.2 is the historical break-even index for contraction or expansion.</p> <p>One key element of this release, which always happens the same week as the US labour report, is the employment index. This also rose, reaching 48.5 from a very soft 45.9 in January. But like the headline index, it remains deep in \u201ccontraction\u201d territory, albeit marginally less so than in January.</p> <p>Moreover, as a guide to payrolls, this is not very reliable. Despite the weak January employment index, January manufacturing payrolls employment actually rose by 29,000, its highest since November 2014. On a more positive note, new orders remained positive at a respectable 51.5.</p> <p>Markets will no doubt see this survey as a positive release, an excuse for stocks to rally and bond yields to rise. But in truth, this is another mixed survey, and not terribly reliable at that. We do not see it as sufficiently robust to warrant the Federal Reserve raising rates again at its March meeting.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56d5b4cbe4b090d60ad09ca7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-03-01T15:27:18.911Z\">3.27pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ericbeebo/status/704684708148420609\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">And there we have it: ISM mfg reverts back closer to Markit.

The weakness led manufacturing to post job losses for the fifth time in the last seven months. On a brighter note, the weakness was not across the board as new orders for intermediate goods edged higher.</p> <p>Manufacturers face a challenging environment, with subdued demand from emerging markets and the ongoing weakness of the oil price weighing heavily on companies in the oil and gas supply chain. Against this backdrop, manufacturers will be looking at the forthcoming Budget and will want to see the Chancellor avoid adding significant costs at a time when business conditions are tough.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <h2> <strong>Mike Rigby, head of manufacturing at Barclays</strong></h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cThe weak start to the year continues for the manufacturing sector with even domestic demand unable to contribute to the levels it has done previously.</p> <p>However, amidst the headwinds of slowing global growth, uncertainty over a Brexit and skills shortages in the industry comes the recent depreciation in sterling which may just provide the jump-start that manufacturing exporters need to boost exports and put a spark back into the sector\u2019s performance.\u201d</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"241dd0e3156be60fec316f88b43a497f13860c99\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/241dd0e3156be60fec316f88b43a497f13860c99/0_0_539_384/500.jpg\" alt=\"UK factory PMI\" width=\"500\" height=\"356\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">UK factory PMI</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Markit/Berenberg</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Kallum Pickering of Berenberg Bank.</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Domestic demand has been the key driver of UK manufacturing in recent months.

    "webTitle": "Sports Direct falls out of FTSE 100 following Guardian investigation", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Sports Direct has been relegated from the FTSE 100 following a torrid three months in which \u00a31.6bn has been wiped from the retailer\u2019s value after a Guardian investigation into working conditions and a slump in trading at its stores. The group\u2019s share price is now down more than 40% since the start of December and the retailer\u2019s demotion from the premier league of UK listed companies was on Tuesday characterised as an example of the punishment investors can mete out to large companies that appear not to treat their workers fairly. Frances O\u2019Grady, the general secretary of the TUC, said: \u201cThis should be a cautionary tale for companies who treat their workers badly. The reputational and financial damage Sports Direct has suffered is of its own making. \u201cSubjecting staff to workhouse conditions is not the way to build a successful business. Shareholders must demand root and branch changes or Sports Direct\u2019s name will continue to be dragged through the mud.\u201d Chuka Umunna, the former shadow business secretary who triggered a parliamentary debate on the retailer following the Guardian\u2019s revelations, said: \u201cWhat this illustrates is that good business is good business and vice versa. So if you\u2019re going to be seen to be pursuing a business model that customers do not approve of there will be an impact on how the company is viewed and valued. \u201cInvestors and customers are not only looking for good value. Increasingly they are looking for good values in a company.\u201d In December, a Guardian investigation revealed how thousands of temporary Sports Direct warehouse workers were receiving hourly rates effectively below the minimum wage. Undercover reporters employed inside the retailer\u2019s warehouse in Shirebrook, Derbyshire, found how thousands of workers were subjected to an extraordinary regime of searches and surveillance, while local primary schoolteachers also told the Guardian that pupils could remain in school while ill \u2013 and return home to empty houses \u2013 as parents working at the depot were too frightened to take time off work. The disclosures prompted the Institute of Directors to brand the company a \u201cscar on British business\u201d and Umunna to file an urgent parliamentary question, which resulted in the business minister Nick Boles being summoned to the Commons to answer questions on the scandal. During the debate, a succession of MPs called for HM Revenue &amp; Customs to investigate if the company had breached minimum wage legislation. Sports Direct responded by announcing a pay rise for its staff, as well as a review of all agency staff terms and conditions, which was to be overseen personally by its billionaire founder, Mike Ashley. In January the retailer shocked the stock market with a warning that annual profits would be \u00a340m lower than expected, which caused the value of the company to slump by almost half a billion pounds. When asked if it had launched any official investigation of Sports Direct, an HMRC spokesperson said: \u201cWhile we don\u2019t discuss individual cases, we always investigate businesses where we believe the national minimum wage is not being paid. We act on information from a range of sources, including workers, third parties or from our own proactive intelligence work.\u201d The retailer has denied that it has failed to pay the minimum wage, while Ashley\u2019s review into the treatment of his own workforce is not expected to report for several weeks. In the meantime, local MPs are to visit the company\u2019s warehouse on 21 March, an invitation the tycoon also extended to members of parliament\u2019s business, innovation and skills select committee. A spokesman for the committee said there were no plans for its members to visit Shirebrook, and that it was in correspondence with Ashley regarding a future appearance before the committee. The quarterly review of the constituents of London Stock Exchange\u2019s main indices will take place on Wednesday and is expected, formally, to relegate Sports Direct from the UK\u2019s 100 most valuable listed firms. The reshuffle is based on the value of companies following the market\u2019s close on Tuesday, at which point the retailer was ranked 142nd on the LSE\u2019s main market. Ashley Hamilton Claxton, the corporate governance manager at Sports Direct shareholder Royal London Asset Management, said: \u201cIt is hardly surprising that Sports Direct has fallen out of the FTSE 100. Over the long term, shareholder value is intrinsically linked to corporate governance and companies ignore this at their peril. The long list of corporate governance failings at Sports Direct is a contributing factor in its fall from the FTSE 100 in our view.\u201d Sports Direct shareholders have long complained about the weak governance at the retailer, which they feel is effectively run like a private company by the founder, who still owns 55% of the shares. Their complaints include the lack of strong independent directors to challenge Ashley, his unorthodox tactic of using Sports Direct funds to take stakes in other retailers and efforts by the company to award further shares to the billionaire in return for the company hitting financial targets. Crispin Odey, a City hedge fund manager and Sports Direct shareholder who once called Ashley a \u201cgenius\u201d, publicly revised his view in December, describing him as \u201cdifficult to house train\u201d and characterising his authority over the retailer\u2019s other directors as \u201cdangerous\u201d. Since the Guardian started publishing the results of its investigation on 9 December, when Sports Direct shares opened at 684p, the shares have lost 274p each to close at 410.3p. The share price slump, which coincided with two negative statements about how the stores were trading and concerns that rival JD Sports is stocking superior products, has personally cost Ashley about \u00a3900m of his paper fortune during that time.",

As recently as last October, McFarlane mused that \u201ca high and progressive dividend will in future need to make up a significant portion of our annual total shareholder return\u201d. Now Staley has cut the dividend in half to give \u201cunfettered ability to accelerate the wind-down of non-core assets\u201d. No wonder the share price is winding down too: it\u2019s now halved since the point at which McFarlane reckoned it could be doubled within three years.

As ever, investors must give thanks for Barclaycard, which breezes along at 22%.</p> <p>Staley is the latest chief executive to believe the investment bank requires just one last heave. Maybe he will confound the doubters eventually, but you can\u2019t blame shareholders for feeling that the timing of Barclays\u2019 promised revival has been massively delayed since the chief executive\u2019s arrival in Canary Wharf.</p> <p>As recently as last October, McFarlane mused that \u201ca high and progressive dividend will in future need to make up a significant portion of our annual total shareholder return\u201d. Now Staley has cut the dividend in half to give \u201cunfettered ability to accelerate the wind-down of non-core assets\u201d.</p> <p>No wonder the share price is winding down too: it\u2019s now halved since the point at which McFarlane reckoned it could be doubled within three years. And no wonder the chairman would rather talk about beastly regulators and governments.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s factories suffered a decline in growth of domestic orders in February which, coupled with a second month of falling exports, saw them register their worst performance in almost three years. The weakening picture, which also saw a second month of declining employment, comes after George Osborne warned of a cocktail of threats and gathering storm clouds in the world economy wreaking havoc on global trade. The Markit/CIPS purchasing manager\u2019s index (PMI) posted its lowest reading since April 2013 \u2013 the first month of the current 35-month sequence of expansion \u2013 at 50.8 in February, down from 52.9 in January, where a figure above 50 indicates expansion. Rob Dobson, a senior economist at Markit, described the UK\u2019s manufacturing sector as in a state of \u201cnear stagnation\u201d after the ongoing difficulties faced by exporters were mirrored in the domestic market. \u201cThe breadth of the slowdown is especially worrisome. The domestic market is showing signs of weakening while export business continued to fall. \u201cA lot of this is driven by the ongoing weakness of global commodity prices. However, there are also signs that weaker growth is driving up competition between manufacturers to secure new business and among their suppliers too.\u201d He added that an expected interest rate rise by the Bank of England was disappearing over the horizon, saying: \u201cThe near stagnation of manufacturing highlights the ongoing fragility of the economic recovery at the start of the year and provides further cover for the Bank of England\u2019s increasingly dovish stance.\u201d The collapse in the UK\u2019s steel industry appears to have filtered out to other areas of industrial production, which slumped to a seventh-month low. A recent fall in the pound is expected to offer manufacturers a helping hand, though Dobson said the likely increase in import costs over the coming months \u201cwill be unwelcome to manufacturers, especially given the imminent introduction of the new national living wage\u201d. David Noble, the chief executive of CIPS, said it was worrying that manufacturers had reduced their input stocks for the fourth month in a row \u201cin anticipation of a slowing growth rate and poor demand\u201d. Scott Bowman, UK economist at Capital Economics, was more upbeat. He said: \u201cWhile this survey shows the near-term prospects for manufacturing remain poor, the recent fall in the pound will provide some welcome relief for manufacturers in time. \u201cWhat\u2019s more, we expect global growth will pick up slightly in 2016, so manufacturing prospects should improve as the year progresses. However, the effect that the EU referendum vote has on the exchange rate and demand from Europe adds to the uncertainties facing the sector.\u201d Figures from Markit also showed the eurozone\u2019s manufacturing sector expanded at a slower rate in February, fuelling fears its economy is heading into trouble. The latest PMI reports showed output growth was at its lowest level for a year after hitting 51.2, down from 52.3 in January. France and Germany were to blame after both hovered near to stagnation. The only boost to confidence came from employment figures that showed the unemployment rate across the eurozone hit its lowest level since August 2011, the early months of the debt crisis. The eurozone jobless rate dropped slightly to 10.3% in January, from 10.4% in December, for the first time since August 2011. That continues a slow recovery since April 2013, when the euro area unemployment rate hit 12.3%, though in Greece and Spain about one in four continue to be out of work. In the wider EU, the jobless rate dropped to 8.9% from 9% \u2013 the lowest in more than six years.",

    "webTitle": "World's 20 richest people are $70bn poorer, says Forbes", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Spare a thought for the billionaires of the world: the combined wealth of the 20 richest people on the planet has fallen by more than $70bn (\u00a350bn) following a slump on global financial markets. The latest annual ranking of billionaires by Forbes shows that falling share prices, a dramatic drop in the price of oil and volatile currency markets have shaken the global elite. The combined wealth of the top 20 has fallen from $899bn last year to $827bn and the number of billionaires in the world has shrunk from a record 1,826 in 2015 to 1,810. It is the first time in seven years that the number of billionaires has decreased, and is the first drop in the wealth of the top 20 since 2012. But more than a third of the $70bn decline was down to just one man: Carlos Slim. The Mexican telecoms tycoon has seen his fortune decrease from $77.1bn to $50bn in just 12 months. Shares in his bank, Grupo Financiero Inbursa, telecoms company Am\u00e9rica M\u00f3vil and mining group Minera Frisco have all tumbled. As a result Slim is no longer the second-richest man in the world \u2013 and is merely fourth. Bill Gates is once again the wealthiest person in the world, although even the Microsoft founder\u2019s fortune has dipped, from $79.2bn to $75bn. The list continues to be dominated by men. Out of 1,810 billionaires, just 190 are women, down from 197 in 2015. Both the female billionaires in the overall top 20 inherited their wealth: Liliane Bettencourt, the heir to the L\u2019Or\u00e9al empire, and Alice Walton, daughter of the Walmart founder, Sam Walton. The richest self-made woman in the world is Zhou Qunfei, who is ranked 205th and valued at $5.9bn. She made her fortune by founding the touchscreen maker Lens Technology, whose biggest customers are Apple and Samsung. Zhou, who is rarely seen in public, grew up in a small village in Hunan, central China. Her mother died when she was five and her father was badly injured in an industrial accident. She helped her family raise pigs and ducks for their food before moving to Shenzhen to work in a factory, making watch lenses in harsh conditions. After winning promotion she saved up $3,000 and decided to set up her own business producing high-quality lenses. This grew into Lens, which today employs more than 75,000 people. Across all billionaires, 1,186 are self-made, 228 inherited their wealth and 396 inherited a portion, but are growing it. Just 33 of the 190 female billionaires are self-made. The biggest gainer on the list was Mark Zuckerberg, the boss of Facebook, whose wealth grew by $11.2bn to give him a total net worth of $44.6bn. Zuckerberg is the sixth-richest person in the world, behind Jeff Bezos, the Amazon founder, Slim, the investor Warren Buffett, Amancio Ortega, the Spanish businessman behind the Zara fashion empire, and Gates. The only people in the top 10 to see their value increase over the last year were Zuckerberg, Bezos, the potential presidential candidate Michael Bloomberg, and Ortega. Ortega, 79, is Europe\u2019s richest man after building Inditex, which owns Zara, the biggest fashion retailer in the world. He keeps a low public profile but is regularly seen in the staff cafeteria at Inditex\u2019s base in Arteixo, a small town in northern Spain close to the city of A Coru\u00f1a. Ortega and his business partner, Rosalia Mera, opened their first store in A Coru\u00f1a in 1975. They wanted to call the shop Zorba, after their favourite film, Zorba the Greek, but were forced to change because a nearby bar had the same name \u2013 calling it Zara instead. Zara and Inditex, which do not advertise, have become renowned for \u201cfast fashion\u201d. At a time when other companies were sending manufacturing to the east Asia, Inditex focused on making as many clothes as possible in Europe, allowing it to stock its shops with the latest fashion quicker than its rivals. Every item of clothing that Zara sells still goes through Spain. There are 489 billionaires in Europe, with their wealth growing from $1.19tn to $1.83tn in the last year. The US remains home to the most billionaires. There are 540 American citizens on the Forbes list compared with 536 last year. However, not every billionaire was happy with their fortune. Forbes has admitted it had an \u201cintense interaction\u201d with Donald Trump about the value of his wealth. The US presidential candidate has repeatedly claimed he is worth more than $10bn, and sent documents to Forbes to try to prove it, but the report has put his fortune at $4.5bn, up from $4.1bn last year. The discrepancy is thought to be at least partly down to the valuation Trump puts on his own brand. The number and value of billionaires in the Asia-Pacific region also grew, but the Middle East, Africa and the rest of the Americas took a hit as the value of oil and other commodities fell sharply. The number of billionaires in the Middle East and Africa fell from 106 to 90, while in the Americas, not including the US, it dropped from 140 to 101. China has the most billionaires after the US, with 251, up on 213 last year. Germany is third with 120 and India is fourth with 84. The UK has 50 billionaires, down from 53 in 2015. It includes seven newcomers, including the theatre producer Cameron Mackintosh and John Bloor, the owner of Triumph Motorcycles. Nick Bryer, head of inequality at Oxfam, said the scale of the wealth enjoyed by the richest people highlighted the growing inequality in the world. He said: \u201cMarket fluctuations have caused the combined wealth of the world\u2019s richest 20 people to drop but their collective $827bn is still greater than the GDP of Turkey. The long-term trend remains one of runaway inequality that is slowing economic growth and undermining the fight against poverty. \u201cGovernments need to act now \u2013 starting with a crackdown on tax havens that allow the super-rich individuals and big companies to avoid paying their fair share of tax and rob poor countries of billions each year that could help to fund schools and hospitals.\u201d",

He keeps a low public profile but is regularly seen in the staff cafeteria at Inditex\u2019s base in Arteixo, a small town in northern Spain close to the city of A Coru\u00f1a.</p> <p>Ortega and his business partner, Rosalia Mera, opened their first store in A Coru\u00f1a in 1975. They wanted to call the shop Zorba, after their favourite film, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2011/aug/14/zorba-greek-nikos-kazantzakis-summer-readings\">Zorba the Greek</a>, but were forced to change because a nearby bar had the same name \u2013 calling it Zara instead.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/03/forbeswomen-zip/giv-27167XEaMlk21AjC3/\" data-alt=\"Top 10 richest women\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/03/forbeswomen-zip/giv-27167XEaMlk21AjC3/\">Top 10 richest women</a> </figure>  <p>Zara and Inditex, which do not advertise, have become renowned for \u201cfast fashion\u201d. At a time when other companies were sending manufacturing to the east Asia, Inditex focused on making as many clothes as possible in Europe, allowing it to stock its shops with the latest fashion quicker than its rivals. Every item of clothing that Zara sells still goes through Spain.</p> <p>There are 489 billionaires in Europe, with their wealth growing from $1.19tn to $1.83tn in the last year. The US remains home to the most billionaires. There are 540 American citizens on the Forbes list compared with 536 last year.</p> <p>However, not every billionaire was happy with their fortune. Forbes has admitted it had an \u201cintense interaction\u201d with Donald Trump about the value of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/16/donald-trump-reveals-net-worth-presidential-campaign-launch\">his wealth</a>. The US presidential candidate has repeatedly claimed he is worth more than $10bn, and sent documents to Forbes to try to prove it, but the report has put his fortune at $4.5bn, up from $4.1bn last year. The discrepancy is thought to be at least partly down to the valuation Trump puts on his own brand.</p> <p>The number and value of billionaires in the Asia-Pacific region also grew, but the Middle East, Africa and the rest of the Americas took a hit as the value of oil and other commodities fell sharply. The number of billionaires in the Middle East and Africa fell from 106 to 90, while in the Americas, not including the US, it dropped from 140 to 101.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/03/forbesunder30-zip/giv-27167QsG7IcXR7QLg/\" data-alt=\"Top 10 richies under 30\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/03/forbesunder30-zip/giv-27167QsG7IcXR7QLg/\">Top 10 richies under 30</a> </figure>  <p>China has the most billionaires after the US, with 251, up on 213 last year.

      "bodyText": "The UK housing market has strengthened at the beginning of 2016, with strong price growth, although the central London market has stablised with flat prices and more normal sales patterns. That is the view of Taylor Wimpey, which has reported a record performance for 2015 with more than 13,200 homes built across the UK and an 8% increase in average selling price. The housebuilder saw full year profits jump 34% to \u00a3603.8m, and it had a record order book at the end of 2015. It returned \u00a3249m to shareholders in July last year, and another \u00a3300m is due to be paid this July. Chief executive Peter Redfern said: We are focused on creating long term value and are supportive of policy initiatives that promote sustainability and reduce volatility in the housing market. With other building shares slipping lower, Taylor Wimpey is steady, up 1p at 187.2p. Analysts at Jefferies said: Like its peers before it, in line with expectations, Taylor Wimpey delivered record 2015 results today, helping around 5,200 households through Help to Buy and delivering 13,219 homes (ex-joint ventures in total). With government and the main opposition party pro-homeownership, we see few challenges to cash generation during the next 12-24 months. The shares currently offer investors a 6.1% yield and we remain comfortable recommending investors buy Taylor Wimpey shares. In our view, Taylor Wimpey has had a clear strategy since the credit crunch, to focus on value rather than volume and to invest in strategic land. The group is getting close to its optimal scale of 14,000 units per annum and the landbank and infrastructure to support this aspiration are in place. With almost a \u2018one-one-out\u2019 landbank strategy and close to half of land strategically sourced, margins and cash generation are high. We therefore believe that there are upside risks to the dividend and fewer operational risks than for its more growth-orientated peers. Peel Hunt issued a hold note, saying: Full-year results were in line with expectations, with operating margins rising sharply and the balance sheet in a net cash position. The previously flagged \u00a3300m special dividend will be paid in July. Trading in 2016 has been good, with pricing and sales rates ahead of the prior year. A solid set of results but we see no near-term catalyst for outperformance. No changes to our forecasts or hold recommendation. At Shore Capital, analyst Robin Hardy said: The year looks to have started well, in line with the peer group, but as elsewhere Taylor Wimpey looks to be selling at a much higher rate than it is able to build. Given the limited lifespans of mortgages, this cannot go on indefinitely without a material increase in production. Planning and labour bottlenecks still make this difficult. At this stage we see no major change likely in forecasts or expected dividend distributions but we slightly raise from \u00a3690m pretax profit (slightly below of consensus) and 11.3p of total dividends to just above \u00a3700m. Our fair value, therefore, is also materially unchanged at 187p and with the shares trading at 186p we can see no reason to change from the current hold stance. And Numis said: Full year results are in line with expectations, but to reflect a slightly stronger volume, price and margin outlook we have increased 2016 estimates by 4%. The group has seen a strong start to the year and in our view there is still upside risks to both profit estimates and the size of the cash return. Accordingly, we are increasing our target price to 205p, which maintains our add recommendation and would equate to a 7% yield for 2017 on our forecasts.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The chairman of Barclays has hit out against the \u00a320bn in fines and taxes imposed on the bank in recent years as it chopped its dividend and announced it was scaling back in Africa to focus on the UK and US. As Barclays reported an 8% fall in profits to \u00a32.1bn in 2015, John McFarlane warned about the \u201csocietal costs\u201d of multibilllion pound taxes and finesand complained that last year\u2019s \u00a31.5bn fine for foreign exchange rigging was one of the highest imposed, even though Barclays\u2019 offences were the same as rivals. \u201cA \u00a350m fine or penalty is the equivalent of employing 1,000 fewer employees, closing 100 small regional branches, or forgoing the capacity to lend over \u00a3500m to small businesses or consumers,\u201d McFarlane wrote in the bank\u2019s annual report. \u201cThe charges are not proportionate to our smaller size and ability to pay relative to many of our peers.\u201d The bank is to cut its dividend payout to shareholders by more than 50% for the coming two years. However it has cut its bonus pool by only 10% to \u00a31.6bn and paid 323 staff more than \u00a31m. The highest paid director, whose identity is not revealed, received \u00a39.5m. Its shares ended 8% lower at 158p on Tuesday \u2013 and at one point were suspended because of the volatility in trading \u2013 after the bank reneged on a promise made by McFarlane only in June to pay a higher dividend every year. The bank\u2019s new chief executive, Jes Staley \u2013 who only took the helm in December \u2013 instead stunned the City by announcing the full-year dividend for 2015 of 6.5p would be cut to 3p in each of 2016 and 2017. \u201cNote to the board: don\u2019t cut the dividend (again) without ample signalling beforehand,\u201d said Sandy Chen, analyst at brokers Cenkos. Since July, when McFarlane promised he would double the share price in three years, the shares have fallen from 260p and Staley, who bought shares at 233p, said there would be \u201ctremendous upside\u201d in the shares once all the conduct issues were dealt with. Making his first presentation since being hired to replace Antony Jenkins, who was ousted in July, Staley said addressing these conduct issues were his priority as he ended Barclays global ambitions to become instead a \u201ctransatlantic\u201d bank. The bank published a list of of regulatory and legal matters it faced after taking more than \u00a34bn of provisions for 2015, including a \u00a31.5bn increase to cover the cost of more payment protection insurance mis-selling claims. New issues which could result in substantial charges include: Enforcement action from the Financial Conduct Authority over the way it sold structured deposit products to UK customers from June 2008 to now. An investigation by the US authorities into hiring practices in Asia, similar to the one disclosed by HSBC over the hiring of individuals with links to government officials, known as \u201cprincelings\u201d. Legal action relating to its fundraising in 2008, being brought by dealmaker Amanda Staveley. She is claiming \u00a3721.4m plus costs. An investigation into the bank\u2019s US wealth management business. A review in its South African business into \u201cpotentially fraudulent activity by certain of its customers using import advance payments\u201d. A court case involving \u201cspoofing\u201d in trading in US government bonds. An American who spent much of his career at US bank JP Morgan, Staley quashed concerns Barclays would need to bolster its financial strength through a cash call, saying there was \u201cno need for a rights issue\u201d. Moral compass Attacking pay practices in the industry in the past, Staley, who was paid more than \u00a3250,000 for one month\u2019s work, said: \u201cIt is fair to question whether bankers lost their moral compass during the 90s and first decade of this century, because of the single minded pursuit of personal wealth. \u201cA company that retains the loyalty of its employees solely based on compensation is a company that gambles with its institutional culture. \u201cI want Barclays to be a bank where our employees choose to work here because they believe in the institution, and its intrinsically valuable role in society.\u201d Top pay was \u00a39.5m Jenkins received \u00a33.4m for his six months at the helm but will continue to be paid until July this year. He also received \u00a3106,000 in legal costs and could receive up to 1.9m shares \u2013 worth \u00a33m at current share prices \u2013 in the coming years. Staley expects the number of jobs at Barclays \u2013 which stands at 130,000 \u2013 to fall by at least 44,000 as he pulls back from Africa. Barclays expanded into South Africa in 2005 when it bought a 60% stake in local bank Absa. He said the headcount had fallen by 5,700 as a result of a hiring freeze he put in place in December. Staley is preparing for the UK ringfencing rules being introduced in 2019 which require banks to separate their high street and investment banking businesses by creating two divisions. Barclays UK will be the ringfenced high street operation, while Barclays Corporate and International will house the once powerful investment banking division. He defended the model of having both investment banking and high street banking and quashed speculation that the investment bank, once of the powerhouse of the business, might be spun off. \u201cThere is no doubt that having a balance between a consumer bank and wholesale bank and has been the safest place to be through virtually any financial crisis. We will have another financial shock \u2013 it\u2019s inevitable.\u201d Gary Greenwood, analyst at Shore Capital, described the results as \u201cdismal\u201d and noted the bank was ditching targets previously set to measure returns to shareholders.",

      "bodyText": "Female workers will be disproportionately hit if a prediction of almost 1 million job losses from the UK\u2019s retail sector becomes a reality, the industry\u2019s trade union has warned. Usdaw, the shop workers union, has written to the British Retail Consortium seeking urgent talks over a report from the trade group that suggested retailers could shed up to 900,000 jobs and close thousands of shops by 2025, as they adjust to rising labour costs and changing technology. The report said the jobs that survive would be more productive. The dominance of women in the sector has raised concerns about them bearing the brunt of job losses. The BRC\u2019s report said women made up 70% of lower-paid people in the retail workforce \u2013 those earning less than 20% above the minimum wage. Usdaw\u2019s general secretary, John Hannett, said the union was pleased to see the BRC \u201chas recognised that low pay is an issue in the sector\u201d. But he wanted more detail on what lay behind the 900,000 job loss prediction and its implications for workers. \u201cWe are convinced that if the job losses come through in those numbers, there will be a bigger impact on women than men,\u201d he added. \u201cWe are looking for urgent talks with the BRC to understand where they are coming from on this. What\u2019s the rationale behind their predictions and how will they work with unions like ours to deliver high quality, better paid jobs?\u201d Women make up almost two-thirds (64%) of the membership of Usdaw, which is running a campaign for better support for parents and carers. Hannett said growing numbers were reporting being under pressure from the changing nature of the retail industry and struggling to balance caring responsibilities with employers\u2019 demands in a \u201c24/7 working environment\u201d. He also warned retailers against the pitfalls of reducing staff to cut costs in a service industry. \u201cCutting back on staff numbers to make cost savings is a false economy. Shopworkers are vital in providing positive customer experiences and short-staffing has an adverse impact on customer service levels,\u201d Hannett said. The BRC has echoed other employer groups in warning about rising labour costs. It said the impact of a new apprenticeship levy on employers and the \u201cnational living wage\u201d, which launches in April, could increase the rate of retail job cuts. But it also highlighted a potential shift to higher quality jobs. The BRC chief, Helen Dickinson, added: \u201cWe hope to see technology and competition resulting in better experiences for the customer and better jobs for those working in retail.\u201d Responding to the BRC report, the Resolution Foundation thinktank was more upbeat about the impact of the \u201cnational living wage\u201d, announced by George Osborne last year, on women working in the retail sector. Its own research has found more than 3.5 million women \u2013 almost 30% of the female workforce \u2013 were set to receive a pay rise as a result of it. The tendency for women to work in low-paying sectors such as retail, hospitality and social care meant they would receive 61% of the benefits of changes to the minimum wage, which will rise by 50p to \u00a37.20 for the over-25s in April. Matt Whittaker, chief economist at the thinktank, noted its finding that employers were showing little appetite for cutting staff levels as a way to cope with higher labour costs. \u201cThe BRC report highlights a number of issues facing the sector, and the national living wage will focus retailers minds\u2019 on how to respond to these challenges,\u201d said Whittaker. \u201cEncouragingly, our work with employers has shown there is strong appetite for businesses to focus on productivity improvements, rather than look to reduce staffing levels.\u201d Just 10% of small firms considered cutting staffing levels in response to the national living wage, rising to 17% of larger organisations, according to research published last week by the Resolution Foundation and the CIPD, the trade body for the human resources sector.",

      "bodyText": "Shares in the London Stock Exchange jumped nearly 9% after the owner of its New York rival said it was pondering an offer for the company, sparking the prospect of a bidding war. The LSE is in talks with Deutsche B\u00f6rse in Frankfurt to seal a \u00a320bn merger \u2013 their third attempt at a tie-up in 16 years. It would combine the LSE\u2019s share trading operation with the German exchange\u2019s Eurex derivatives business, creating the third largest exchange operator in the world in terms of stock market value. However, Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), which is based in Atlanta and owns the New York Stock Exchange, said on Tuesday morning that it was considering making an offer for the LSE. It stressed that no approach had been made to the LSE\u2019s board, and no decision had been made as to whether to pursue such an offer. The news sent shares in the LSE up 8.8% to a record high of \u00a329.14 in early trading. The LSE confirmed that its board had not received a formal proposal from ICE, adding that discussions with Deutsche B\u00f6rse was progressing. Bloomberg reported late on Monday that ICE was preparing a counterbid with advisers including Morgan Stanley. Chicago-based CME Group is also assessing whether it wants to enter the fray, according to the news agency. The world of exchanges has seen a flurry of dealmaking in recent years. ICE, run by Jeff Sprecher, took a big slice of the European derivatives market when it bought NYSE Euronext in 2013, which gave it the derivatives business Liffe. Under UK takeover rules, ICE must make a formal offer for the LSE no later than 29 March, and Deutsche B\u00f6rse must table an offer by 22 March. Deutsche B\u00f6rse and the LSE are planning a \u201cmerger of equals\u201d in which both companies would share control of the boardroom, retain their separate brands and operate under a holding company structure. The German exchange would own 54.4% of the merged holding company, compared with LSE\u2019s 45.6%. The LSE\u2019s chief executive, Xavier Rolet, would leave. Rolet has been on an acquisition spree since taking charge in 2009. His Deutsche B\u00f6rse counterpart, Carsten Kengeter, will take the same role at the combined company.",

It would combine the LSE\u2019s share trading operation with the German exchange\u2019s Eurex derivatives business, creating the third largest exchange operator in the world in terms of stock market value. </p> <p>However, Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), which is based in Atlanta and owns the New York Stock Exchange, <a href=\"http://www.investegate.co.uk/intercontinental-exc/rns/statement-re--possible-offer/201603010809015825Q/\">said</a> on Tuesday morning that it was considering making an offer for the LSE. It stressed that no approach had been made to the LSE\u2019s board, and no decision had been made as to whether to pursue such an offer.</p> <p>The news sent shares in the LSE up 8.8% to a record high of \u00a329.14 in early trading. </p> <p>The LSE confirmed that its board had not received a formal proposal from ICE, adding that discussions with Deutsche B\u00f6rse was progressing.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-02-29/ice-said-to-explore-rival-bid-for-lse-to-thwart-deutsche-boerse\">Bloomberg reported</a> late on Monday that ICE was preparing a counterbid with advisers including Morgan Stanley. Chicago-based CME Group is also assessing whether it wants to enter the fray, according to the news agency. </p> <p>The world of exchanges has seen a flurry of dealmaking in recent years. ICE, run by Jeff Sprecher, took a big slice of the European derivatives market when it bought NYSE Euronext in 2013, which gave it the derivatives business Liffe.</p> <p>Under UK takeover rules, ICE must make a formal offer for the LSE no later than 29 March, and Deutsche B\u00f6rse must table an offer by 22 March.</p> <p><a href=\"http://deutsche-boerse.com/INTERNET/MR/mr_presse.nsf/0/6EC1CF3FE4E79132C1257F650033EFE0/$File/160226_Pressrelease%20Disclosure%20of%20further%20terms%20EN.pdf?OpenElement\">Deutsche B\u00f6rse and the LSE are planning a \u201cmerger of equals\u201d</a> in which both companies would share control of the boardroom, retain their separate brands and operate under a holding company structure. </p> <p>The German exchange would own 54.4% of the merged holding company, compared with LSE\u2019s 45.6%. The LSE\u2019s chief executive, Xavier Rolet, would leave. Rolet has been on an acquisition spree since taking charge in 2009.</p> <p>His Deutsche B\u00f6rse counterpart, Carsten Kengeter, will take the same role at the combined company.</p>",

Anglo American has added 20.15p to 500.4p after positive news on diamond sales from its De Beers\u2019 subsidiary. Rough diamond sales for the second sales cycle rose to $610m from $545m in the first cycle. De Beers chief executive Philippe Mellier said: Retailer restocking after the end of year holiday season is supporting demand for polished diamonds and in turn, we are seeing improved demand...for rough diamonds. However, we remain mindful of the need for a cautious approach as the recovery continues. But Fresnillo has fallen 26.5p to 973.5p after the Mexican precious metals miner reported a 15.4% drop in full year profits to \u00a3212.4m. And Glencore is down 3.35p at 129.9p as it unveiled a 32% fall in annual profits to $8.7bn as well as $5.8bn of impairment charges. But overall the FTSE 100 has added 18.20 points to 6115.29, with the disappointing Chinese purchasing managers survey prompting talk of further stimulus measures from the central bank. UK manufacturing activity slumped to a near three year low, suggesting any interest rate rise is unlikely to be on the agenda for some time. Meanwhile eurozone PMIs also disappointed. Elsewhere Barclays has fallen 17.1p to 154.95p following a 2% drop in full year profits. Ashtead is down 131p at 793p, the biggest loser in the leading index, despite a 20% rise in nine month profits. Analysts are concerned about the impact of a US slowdown on the equipment rental group. Charles Huggins at Hargreaves Lansdown said: Ashtead generates the bulk of its profit in US non-residential construction markets where conditions remain favourable - for now. However, the market is clearly worried about a potential US slowdown. Ashtead\u2019s plans to cut back capital expenditure and reduce leverage are sensible in this context, but do little to allay investors\u2019 concerns of tougher times ahead. But Direct Line is up 11.5p at 400.1p as the insurer reported better than expected full year profits of \u00a3507.5m. The biggest rise in the FTSE 100 is London Stock Exchange, up 199p at \u00a328.77 as US group Intercontinental Exchange said it was considering making an offer, thus barging into the proposed merger with Deutsche B\u00f6rse. Among the mid-caps Greggs, 157p better at \u00a311.92, and Just Eat, 16.2p better at 401.9p, both benefited from positive updates. On Just Eat, Peel Hunt said: The margin performance in the UK is materially better than we had expected and this appears to be long-term fundamental as opposed to a short-term boost. There is a lot of noise around the delivery market and whilst there are risks, we believe these have been overplayed in the short term. Given the margin surprise and recent share price weakness, we move to add from hold.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "When Roman invaders made landfall on the British coast in AD43, it was at the present-day settlement of Richborough where they probably set up camp. Now this sleepy corner of rural Kent has become an unlikely battleground once again \u2013 as the potential site for telecoms masts as high as London\u2019s Shard skyscraper that will enable high-speed trading firms to make millions. Vigilant Global and New Line Networks (NLN) want to build communications towers to shave milliseconds off the time it takes to make multimillion-dollar trades. But their proposals have met with dismay from locals, who are opposed to the idea of the \u201ceyesore\u201d masts in their neighbourhood. The two firms, who build ultra-fast cable networks that hedge funds and investment banks pay to use, have submitted planning applications for the masts near Richborough. They hope that the giant structures, both more than 1,000ft high, will win them business from high-frequency traders, known as \u201cflash boys\u201d. High-frequency trading is a form of financial transaction that uses powerful computers to make large trades as quickly as possible. It requires ultra-fast data transfer, in some cases not much slower than the speed of light, that allows traders to steal a march on rivals by closing deals fractionally quicker. The two masts would allow both firms to beam microwave signals across the Channel to Europe milliseconds more quickly than is currently possible. In the case of NLN, the 1,000ft mast would be part of a 3,200-mile cable network stretching from New York to Land\u2019s End, on to London and eventually to Frankfurt, Germany\u2019s financial centre. Both towers could be ready by the middle of next year if planning applications with Dover council run smoothly, enabling quicker communication with European markets. But locals, some of whom say that they have been told nothing about the plans, expressed concern about the masts. Tara Gilpin, 28, works at a children\u2019s care home, which cannot be named for the protection of its residents, near the proposed site of NLN\u2019s mast. She has never heard of NLN \u2013 a joint venture between trading firms Jump Trading and KCG \u2013 but doesn\u2019t like the sound of their proposals. \u201cFirst and foremost, it would be an eyesore and this is a nice place,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is a residential care home for young people. You fear they might try to climb up it, so it could be a danger as well. \u201cNo one wants a mast when they look out on their back garden. It\u2019s lining their [the companies\u2019] pockets, so they can build in their own back garden if they want.\u201d Retired dentist Andrew Cracknell, 64, and his wife Judi, live closer to the mast site, in a picturesque cottage where a dwelling has stood since 1442. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a backwater round here, quite old-fashioned,\u201d said Andrew Cracknell. He is also yet to hear anything about NLN\u2019s plans and fears heavy traffic during the projected six months of construction. \u201cThere seems to be no end to what they\u2019ll come up with. \u201cIt\u2019s obviously not something I\u2019d be keen on and nobody has asked me about it.\u201d If the Cracknells and Gilpin want an idea of how serious high-frequency traders are about gaining even the slightest advantage, they could read the Michael Lewis book Flash Boys. It details how a company called Spread Networks dug an 827-mile trench under mountains and across rivers from Chicago to New Jersey \u2013 at a cost of $300m. The result was an ultra-latency line that reduced the time taken to transmit data from one end to the other from 17 milliseconds to 13 milliseconds. NLN and Vigilant aim to make similar time savings with masts instead of cable. Both of them insist that they won\u2019t just be monuments to the power of high finance, but will also benefit the local community. Craig McKinlay, the Conservative MP whose South Thanet constituency would host both masts if they secure planning consent, is far from convinced. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing in this that helps the community,\u201d he said. \u201cBeyond the visual impact, which is only going to be negative, does it affect nearby Manston airport, which we\u2019re trying to reopen?\u201d But Vigilant and NLN are understandably keen to do everything they can to allay such concerns. NLN said: \u201cNLN is committed to serving the communities in which we operate. We look forward to working closely with the local Dover and wider East Kent communities to collectively develop a plan that enables them to share in the benefits of a proposed mast development.\u201d Potential benefits, they say, include better broadband speeds, mobile reception and radio signal, achieved by attaching telecoms infrastructure to the masts. Vigilant Global also played down the potential negative impact on people of having a 1,000-foot high mast in their eyeline. Its location was \u201cchosen to minimise impact to the surrounding populations, natural resources and community assets, while also meeting communications network requirements in the UK and Europe\u201d, it said. The company added: \u201cThe proposed mast is just 3 metres wide, and our proposal would avoid the need for the mast\u2019s guys to cross railway lines, roads, power lines and waterways. \u201cTo share in the wider benefits from the mast with the local community, we have entered into discussions with several local organisations to provide access to the mast and to provide additional support.\u201d",

We look forward to working closely with the local Dover and wider East Kent communities to collectively develop a plan that enables them to share in the benefits of a proposed mast development.\u201d</p> <p>Potential benefits, they say, include better broadband speeds, mobile reception and radio signal, achieved by attaching telecoms infrastructure to the masts. </p> <p>Vigilant Global also played down the potential negative impact on people of having a 1,000-foot high mast in their eyeline. Its location was \u201cchosen to minimise impact to the surrounding populations, natural resources and community assets, while also meeting communications network requirements in the UK and Europe\u201d, it said.</p> <p>The company added: \u201cThe proposed mast is just 3 metres wide, and our proposal would avoid the need for the mast\u2019s guys to cross railway lines, roads, power lines and waterways.</p> <p>\u201cTo share in the wider benefits from the mast with the local community, we have entered into discussions with several local organisations to provide access to the mast and to provide additional support.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Many popular foods still contain high levels of salt, with tinned tomato soup, cheddar cheese, chilled ready meals and cornflakes among the worst offenders, according to research by a health campaign group. Consensus Action on Salt and Health (Cash) said huge progress made prior to 2010 under a national salt-reduction programme overseen by the Food Standards Agency (FSA) had been sacrificed under a voluntary system in which retailers and manufacturers police themselves. Under the so-called responsibility deal, a complex set of targets are in place to be met by December 2017. Cash said high levels of salt remained a major contributor to raised blood pressure, a leading cause of death and disability. The group urged David Cameron to set up an independent agency for nutrition to rescue the previous reduction programme and introduce regulated targets for salt, saturated fat and sugar. In a survey of popular supermarket foods, Cash found that nearly half (47%) of soups contained at least the same amount of salt per serving as two slices of Domino\u2019s cheese and tomato pizza. The saltiest soup culprit was Baxters vegetarian Italian tomato and basil with 3.5g salt per 400g serving \u2013 more than a McDonald\u2019s Big Mac and large fries. According to NHS guidelines , adults should eat no more than 6g of salt a day \u2013 the equivalent of a teaspoon. Yet consumption can be difficult to monitor as three-quarters of the salt eaten is in common foods such as bread, breakfast cereal and ready meals. The majority (95%) of cheese products surveyed by Cash were found to contain more salt per serving than a packet of ready-salted crisps. Its analysis of the salt content of 201 blocks of cheese found that some products had more salt than in 2012, such as Sainsbury\u2019s Lighter mature British cheese, which had increased its salt content by 16%, from 1.7g/100g to 1.98g/100g. Luxury ready meals were also singled out for excessive salt, with Marks &amp; Spencer\u2019s Gastropub cottage pie and the Co-operative\u2019s Truly Irresistible cottage pie both loaded with 2.9g of salt per 400g serving. Cash said this was close to the amount of salt in two Pot Noodle packs (3g). Kellogg\u2019s cornflakes contained the highest salt content of all cornflakes surveyed, with more than three times as much salt as Aldi\u2019s Harvest Morn cornflakes (1.13g/100g against 0.34g/100g). Graham MacGregor, professor of cardiovascular medicine at Queen Mary University of London and chairman of Cash, said: \u201cUnder the FSA and Cash, the UK led the world in salt reduction. It is a tragedy for public health that the coalition government in 2010 seized responsibility for nutrition from the FSA to the Department of Health where they made the food industry responsible for policing themselves. \u201cUnsurprisingly, this has failed and has resulted in many thousands of unnecessary deaths from strokes and heart disease. It\u2019s imperative that responsibility for nutrition be handed back to an independent agency.\u201d Sonia Pombo, a nutritionist and campaign manager for Cash, said: \u201cThe food we eat is now the biggest cause of death and ill health in the UK, owing to the large amounts of salt, saturated fat and sugars added by the food industry. \u201cWhile many food manufacturers initially made a concerted effort to reduce the salt in their products, others are now failing to do so and in turn are putting the nation\u2019s health at risk.\u201d Retailers strongly defended their products. Janet Taylor, diet and health manager for Co-op Food, said: \u201cThe Co-op is committed to making it easier for customers to make healthier choices through a number of initiatives including reformulating products and clear, honest labelling. \u201cEighty-seven per cent of our own-brand products already meet the 2017 salt targets and we are working hard to increase this figure, while the front-of-pack colour-coded labelling system we use on all our products helps customers make an informed choice.\u201d An M&amp;S spokeswoman said: \u201cWe\u2019ve led the way on salt reduction in many products and this product already meets the government\u2019s salt targets for 2017. The salt content is clearly labelled on the front of the pack, allowing customers to make an informed choice.\u201d",
