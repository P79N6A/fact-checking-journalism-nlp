      "bodyText": "The Australian government \u201cled the charge\u201d to ensure that the world\u2019s largest trade deal, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, had adequate safeguards for environmental policy, the trade minister, Andrew Robb, has said. The full text of the 6,000-page document was released on Thursday night, and already groups are expressing concern over the sparse attention given to climate change in the deal. \u201cIt seems to me remarkable that the environmental chapter in the Trans-Pacific Partnership doesn\u2019t even mention the phrase climate change,\u201d University of Queensland intellectual property expert Matthew Rimmer told the ABC. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like Voldemort in the Harry Potter series, it\u2019s a taboo phrase in the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\u201d But Robb has defended the deal, which has taken years to negotiate. \u201cIn the environmental area, now it\u2019s very explicit on those issues. It does provide safeguards, the best safeguards that have ever been provided in any agreement,\u201d Robb told ABC Radio on Friday morning. \u201cWe [Australia] have been successful in leading the charge in getting significant carve-outs which preclude public policy in environment areas from being subject to litigation.\u201d Of particular concern to groups opposed to the TPP is the inclusion of a clause that makes it possible for foreign investors to sue governments if they think domestic laws are harmful to their investments. Robb acknowledged that the clause, known as investor-state dispute settlements (ISDS), has been a sticking point, but said that Australia had negotiated a good deal. \u201cAustralia has been at the forefront of tackling this issue, that the investor state dispute settlement mechanism is not used and abused by groups in other countries to ... litigate against particular countries,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has been obvious all along where were the sensitive areas and I\u2019m very confident that we have addressed those and protected issues that were of great concern to various groups within the Australian community.\u201d The Australian Free Trade and Investment Network is not convinced. The group has been sceptical of the ISDS clause, and of the TPP more broadly. \u201cThe general \u2018safeguards\u2019 in the text [regarding ISDS] are qualified, and similar to those in other recent agreements which have not prevented cases against health and environmental laws,\u201d coordinator of the network, Patricia Ranald, said. \u201cThey do not address the fundamental flaws of an unfair international tribunal system which has no independent judiciary, no precedents and no appeals.\u201d Ranald pointed to a legal dispute between tobacco company Philip Morris and the Australian government over plain packaging of cigarettes, which the company argues limits its right to intellectual property by removing its ability to brand its products. Robb said that \u201cpredictable\u201d opponents of the trade deal have not had a chance to properly study the expansive document. \u201cThey don\u2019t do themselves any favours, much less the nation, by jumping at shadows, peddling lines they\u2019ve been peddling for years without a decent look at what\u2019s been negotiated,\u201d he said. \u201cThis has been negotiated over many, many years. We were aware from day one [of] the major areas of sensitivity [and] we have spent literally, you know, hundreds of hours on these areas.\u201d Labor would carefully analyse the text before committing to it, trade spokeswoman Penny Wong said. \u201cLegitimate concerns have been raised by many Australians about the content of this agreement. The government and Andrew Robb must explain the detail of the agreement, rather than attacking those raising concerns as anti-trade,\u201d she said. An inquiry by the joint standing committee on treaties would allow business, experts and the public to have their say on the deal, she said. The Greens leader, Richard Di Natale, told reporters on Friday the text of the deal \u201cconfirms our worst fears\u201d. \u201cWe are handing over control to unelected, unaccountable foreign multinational corporations, to give them the power to sue governments for protecting peoples\u2019 health and protecting the environment,\u201d he said. The TPP still needs to be ratified by the 12 countries that have reached an agreement on the deal: Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, the United States and Vietnam. The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry has welcomed the deal, labelling it \u201cimportant\u201d and \u201cfar-reaching\u201d. \u201cIt has the potential to reduce costs across global supply chains, provide for predictable common rules for investment and services and open previously restricted markets for our goods and services,\u201d the chamber said. It argued that releasing the text before the deal is ratified allows stakeholders to express concern to parliamentarians before the deal is formally signed off. \u201cWe congratulate the government and negotiators on their efforts to advance trade liberalisation across our region and hope that the presence of the TPP can inspire the governments of the world to continue embracing further liberalisation,\u201d the group said. Consumer group Choice wants the text of the document to be analysed by independent experts. \u201cThe TPP will impact nearly every part of the Australian economy \u2013 it covers financial services, food, medicines and how our public services operate. It is too big and too important to simply wave through without an assessment of what we\u2019re trading away,\u201d campaign manager Erin Turner said. \u201cChoice urges the government to commit to a full cost-benefit analysis by the Productivity Commission of the TPP before Australia signs on to the complex new rules in this hefty document.\u201d Ratification of the trade deal could hit a snag in the United States, as the country enters its campaign to elect a new president. Barack Obama, who is about to enter his last year in office and has a lot riding on the deal, has strongly urged Congress to pass it. He wrote an online piece outlining how the deal would affect American workers. \u201cThe TPP means that America will write the rules of the road in the 21st century,\u201d Obama said. \u201cWhen it comes to Asia, one of the world\u2019s fastest-growing regions, the rulebook is up for grabs. And if we don\u2019t pass this agreement \u2013 if America doesn\u2019t write those rules \u2013 then countries like China will.\u201d \u201cThat would only threaten American jobs and workers and undermine American leadership around the world,\u201d he said. The American nurses union, National Nurses United, has warned that patent rules favour big pharmaceutical companies and therefore limit the availability of cheaper generic drugs. \u201cThat could be a death sentence for countless patients in need of affordable medications around the world,\u201d executive director of the union, RoseAnn DeMoro, said. Robb said that there was a \u201ca lot of politics being played\u201d in the US over the TPP, due to posturing ahead of an election. But he remained confident that the deal would pass Congress due to its importance to the US economy and its standing in the region.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Shake Shack is taking a big bite out of the burger market. Its revenue increased 67% to $53m compared with last year, the company announced in its third-quarter report released on Thursday. The company\u2019s sales increased 70% to $51.3m and same-store sales increased by 17%. The company credited these \u201cextraordinary\u201d results with menu price increases implemented earlier this year, increase in brand awareness due to the company\u2019s IPO in January and the return of crinkle fries. The results announced on Friday \u201csurpassed our expectations\u201d, said Randy Garutti, chief executive officer of Shake Shack. Garutti, who has been with the company since it sold its first hot dog in Madison Square Park 14 years ago, said he did not expect to share numbers as good as these with investors on Thursday. In the week leading up to Thursday\u2019s report, the company\u2019s stock was up 12%. After the quarterly report was released, the stock went up by 6% in the first hour of after-hours trading. Garutti noted that the company opened four more Shake Shacks in the US during the three months preceding 30 September. Since the end of the quarter, the company has opened two more Shake Shacks in the US. \u201c2015 has been an exceptional year for us,\u201d Garutti said in a statement. Shake Shack, which went public in January 2015, has opened 12 new US stores this year. \u201cLooking ahead, we now expect to open at least 14 domestic company-operated Shacks next year and beyond. We remain well positioned for continued success as we capitalize on our unique development opportunities.\u201d For the year ending 30 December, the company had updated its outlook, predicting that its total revenue for the year will be between $189m to $190m, instead of $171m to $174m as previously expected. Shake Shack\u2019s better-than-expected report comes at a time when one of its rivals \u2013 McDonald\u2019s \u2013 is attempting to stage a comeback. CEO Steve Easterbrook took over the burger giant in March and has been working on a turnaround strategy since day one. The plan, which includes all-day breakfast, seems to be working. This quarter, for the first time since 2013, US sales rose by 0.9%. However, considering Shake Shack\u2019s ambitious growth strategy, it might take more than an all-day breakfast for McDonald\u2019s to keep the newcomer at bay. To try to protect its turf in the UK from competitors like Five Guys and Shake Shack, McDonald\u2019s is planning to release a range of premium burgers at 28 of its London locations. The burgers will be served with brioche-style buns and will cost \u00a34.69. On a call with analysts, Shake Shack executives noted that increasing the minimum wage could cause a setback for the company and its competitors. But Shake Shack added that most of its employees are paid a couple of dollars above local minimum wages \u2013 with workers in DC being paid $12 an hour and those in Texas $11 an hour. The executives said paying a higher hourly wage allows the company to hire the \u201cright workers\u201d. Ultimately, Shake Shack is confident that its burgers will continue to sell well. For 2016, the company predicts its revenue will be between $237m to $242m with same-store sales growing between 2.5% to 3%. In addition to opening 14 new US Shacks, the company also plans to open eight international Shacks in the UK, the Middle East and in Japan.",

But Shake Shack added that most of its employees are paid a couple of dollars above local minimum wages \u2013 with workers in DC being paid $12 an hour and those in Texas $11 an hour. The executives said paying a higher hourly wage allows the company to hire the \u201cright workers\u201d. </p> <p>Ultimately, Shake Shack is confident that its burgers will continue to sell well. For 2016, the company predicts its revenue will be between $237m to $242m with same-store sales growing between 2.5% to 3%. In addition to opening 14 new US Shacks, the company also plans to open eight international Shacks in the UK, the Middle East and in Japan.</p>",

Even if you had bought just before the financial crisis in 2008, you would have doubled your money by now. And if you had the sense to back the trust the following year, at the bottom of the market, you would have enjoyed a ride from \u00a37 to \u00a336 a share. Electra, in other words, is not obviously in need of a shakeup led by an activist investor. Yet that prospect is now in view. Edward Bramson from Sherborne Partners succeeded in getting himself and a sidekick voted on to Electra\u2019s board on Thursday. He failed a year ago, when he owned 20%. Now, armed with almost 30%, he has managed to crawl over the line. Indeed, the narrowness of Bramson\u2019s victory is striking. Of 16.6m votes cast in his favour, he controls 10.7m, and co-investors in his Sherborne fund (notably Aviva Investors and Fidelity) have 4m. That leaves about 2m floating voters who thought Bramson was just what Electra needed. By contrast, some 14.4m votes backed the board, in effect endorsing chairman Roger Yates\u2019s view that Bramson made \u201cill-judged, ill-informed and ill-founded\u201d claims about Electra\u2019s business. Yates resigned on the spot after the vote, which was the correct course, since the two men clearly couldn\u2019t coexist in the same boardroom, but he was right in his assessment of the raider. A year ago Bramson claimed there was \u00a31bn of hidden value to be unlocked at Electra, but offered no evidence to support the boast. This time he mostly grumbled about the supposed lack of independence of Electra\u2019s board, and its relationship with Electra Partners, the firm that manages the funds. But again, the arguments were unclear and his data unconvincing. The suspicion is that Bramson\u2019s real aim is to gain back-door control of Electra without paying a takeover premium. Hold on, the Sherborne camp would argue: his interests are directly aligned with other shareholders\u2019. In theory, yes; in practice, one doubts it. Investment trusts work best when there are clear lines of responsibility \u2013 a board appoints a manager of the funds and then holds that manager accountable. Bramson\u2019s past remarks suggest he wants to meddle in that relationship by making day-to-day decisions about how portfolio companies should be managed. That might produce a quick gain or two, and the fizz of superficial success; but, over time, Electra would become a different beast, less able to stick to its long-term path. Bramson has only two boardroom seats out of eight, so won\u2019t necessarily have everything his own way, but momentum is on his side. Good luck, Kate Barker, the new chair, in keeping the peace; it looks an impossible task, especially when two supposedly reputable City investment houses like Aviva and Fidelity are prepared to swallow a prospectus as thin as Bramson\u2019s. Activism is a fine thing when it\u2019s done well, but Electra was the wrong target. A grubby day for the City. A mistimed transformation The curse of the \u201ctransformational\u201d deal strikes again. It was only in February last year that Amec unveiled its \u00a31.85bn purchase of Foster Wheeler, marrying its engineering operation, servicing oil and gas explorers and producers, with a company plying its trade towards the refinery end of the industry. The dreaded transformative label was applied by chief executive Samir Brikho to describe the wonders the takeover would bring. Some 12 months after completion, Amec\u2019s share price has halved, and now the dividend is going the same way. It\u2019s being chopped in half to save \u00a385m, a decision the City had failed to see coming \u2013 hence the 23% plunge in the share price on Thursday. Shareholders clearly placed too much faith in Amec\u2019s previous confidence in managing its way through a \u201clower for longer\u201d period for the oil price. Ian McHoul, Amec\u2019s finance director, now says customers talk of \u201clower for even longer\u201d and put even more pressure on contractors. The dividend must join the list of savings Amec is trying to make. By way of defence, the company could argue that the heaviest pressure is being felt upstream, where old Amec is concentrated, rather than in Foster Wheeler\u2019s activities. In that sense, the new arrival has added defensive qualities. But that\u2019s too charitable. The takeover \u2013 funded half in shares and half in cash \u2013 also saddled Amec with debts of \u00a31bn. Foster Wheeler may have been the right target, but the timing and price were horrible. Freshfields, the panel and the party You know Freshfields \u2013 splendid legal chaps, members of the lawyers\u2019 Magic Circle. Well, Freshfields, or Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer in full, now has another distinction: it is the first legal firm to receive a censure from the Takeover Panel, a body that has existed for 47 years. The breach of the rules may not sound serious outside the Square Mile. Freshfields, plus investment bank Credit Suisse, failed to consult the panel about the existence of a concert party, or relationship between two parties. JP Morgan got a milder telling-off. The details of the tale need not detain us (they relate to the formation of Bumi, a Nat Rothschild mining venture shambles, via two acquisitions in Indonesia in 2011). But this may be an occasion when censure works better than a regulatory fine. Freshfields and the others must wear their rarely imposed badges of dishonour \u2013 and the time it took the panel to reach its conclusions suggests the offenders fought this ruling every step of the way.",

      "bodyText": "Two British citizens face lengthy prison sentences in the US after being convicted of fixing the Libor interest rate in the first case of its kind to reach a courtroom across the Atlantic. The two former traders at the Dutch Rabobank, Anthony Allen, Rabobank\u2019s former global head of liquidity and finance, and Anthony Conti, a former senior trader, both intend to appeal against the verdicts reached by a federal jury in Manhattan. The US justice department said the verdicts showed that the authorities were determined to crack down on financial crime. \u201cToday\u2019s verdicts illustrate the department\u2019s successful efforts to hold accountable bank executives responsible for this global fraud scheme,\u201d said Leslie Caldwell, head of the Justice Department\u2019s criminal division. Allen, 44, slumped over a table in court as the jury foreman read out the verdict. Conti, 46, held his head up. Lawyers for both men said they planned to appeal. \u201cThis is just round one,\u201d Michael Schachter, Allen\u2019s lawyer, said. \u201cTony Allen looks forward to pursuing all available options. He is disappointed with the verdict.\u201d They will be sentenced next March and were not remanded in custody. Of 13 people charged by the Justice Department with offences related to Libor rigging, seven are former Rabobank traders, including Allen and Conti, who earlier this year waived their right to extradition to fight the charges. Prosecutors said Allen and Conti participated in a five-year conspiracy at Rabobank to rig Libor rates in dollar and yen. They relied on testimony from three former Rabobank traders who pleaded guilty as part of cooperation deals, as well as emails and instant messages that were sent at the time. Prosecutor Brian Young had cited several emails as \u201crock solid evidence\u201d and said the pair had left a \u201cleft a paper trail a mile long\u201d. He had told jurors that the two British citizens were \u201cactive and enthusiastic participants\u201d in a conspiracy at Rabobank to rig Libor rates. Lawyers for Allen and Conti argued that while others at the bank may have been trying to rig Libor, their clients had submitted honest rate estimates. They argued that prosecutors took documents out of context and that cooperating witnesses lied about their clients\u2019 role in the scheme in the hope of getting lenient sentences. Allen opted to testify in his own defence, telling jurors he rarely was involved personally in submitting numbers used to calculate Libor and that in those few instances, he ignored traders\u2019 requests to bias the rate. Schachter had argued that the prosecution case against his client boiled down to just 12 emails and instant messages over four years. Schachter had told the court: \u201cThis is the kind of case that, the more you look, the more you dig in, the more the prosecution\u2019s case falls apart. The pieces here don\u2019t fit together because Tony Allen is not guilty.\u201d Aaron Williamson, Conti\u2019s lawyer, had said: \u201cTony never let a trader\u2019s request influence him to make a fraudulent Libor submission.\u201d In the UK, a former trader at the Swiss bank UBS, Tom Hayes, is serving 14 years in jail after being convicted of rigging Libor by jury earlier this year. The trials followed a string of regulatory fines on banks, starting with Barclays, which was fined \u00a3290m in June 2012 by authorities on both sides of the Atlantic. The fine sparked a public outcry and led to the creation of the parliamentary commission on banking standards, chaired by Conservative MP Andrew Tyrie, which set out a series of measures to tighten up ethics in the City. Rabobank was fined \u00a3662m by regulators in October 2013 over the Libor scandal, sparking a move by the bank\u2019s chairman, Piet Moerland, to step aside earlier than he had planned. The UK regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, levied \u00a3105m of the total. In total, some 22 people in the US and UK have been charged, and a series of trials are already under way. US prosecutors have also brought charges against two other Rabobank traders.",

      "bodyText": "Kanye West has many fans, but Herbert Hainer is clearly not among them. Asked which of the American rapper\u2019s songs he likes most during an earnings call on Thursday, the chief executive of German sportswear company Adidas laughed. \u201cI guess I\u2019m too old to follow Kanye\u2019s music.\u201d Hainer and his business will be hoping that Adidas customers are more switched on. Next week, the latest trainer from the collaboration between the pop star and Adidas, launched under the \u201cYeezy\u201d range, hits stores. If the buzz on Twitter and Instagram is to be believed, the release of a new Yeezy Boost 350 is much anticipated. Adidas is also hoping that its fiercest competitor takes note. The collaboration with the rapper is Adidas\u2019s latest attempt to gain ground in its ongoing rivalry with Nike. Although the company with the three distinctive stripes presented solid third-quarter growth figures on Thursday, with sales up 13% to \u20ac4.8bn (\u00a33.4bn) and net income up 10% to \u20ac311m, it is still struggling to catch up with its old enemy. Last year, Nike\u2019s revenues rose 10% to $30.6bn (\u00a320bn). Adidas, meanwhile, reported 2% growth on revenues of \u20ac14.5bn for 2014. The gap gets even bigger once company targets are factored in: Nike recently set its revenue target for the year 2020 at $50bn. Adidas\u2019s aim for the same date is less than half that, at \u20ac22bn. Much of this disparity is due to the role of the US market in global sportswear, and the relative positions of Nike and Adidas within it. The country, where Nike was founded in 1964, accounted for $96.5bn of the industry\u2019s total revenue of $268bn last year, according to research firm Euromonitor International. Western Europe, the home turf of Adidas, was worth only $56bn. North America is not only the biggest market in terms of revenue. \u201cIt still defines what\u2019s cool in sportswear\u201d, says Christoph Metzelder, the former German football star and now managing director of sports marketing firm Jung von Matt/sports in Hamburg. Coolness, however, has not been a key asset for Adidas in its battle with Nike until now. Adidas has focused on the functionality of its shoes as its main selling point. This has been the case since the company\u2019s founder, Adi Dassler, invented a football boot with removable studs, whose suitability in all weather conditions made it an unlikely hero of the West Germany football team that won the 1954 World Cup in the \u201cMiracle of Bern\u201d. Until the late 1970s that worked quite well and Adidas dominated the market. But then came Nike. Nike\u2019s co-founder, Phil Knight, chose a different approach. When he brought in American basketball star Michael Jordan as the brand\u2019s face in 1985, he hit a nerve. The \u201cAir Jordan\u201d has been lauded as the most famous sneaker ever since. In 2005, Adidas tried to catch up by acquiring its US competitor Reebok.Hainer, who has led Adidas since 2001, called the $3.8bn deal \u201ca once-in-a-lifetime opportunity\u201d. But it has not paid off so far. Last year, Adidas dropped to the No 3 rank in North America for the first time, falling behind newcomer Under Armour. But Adidas is far from giving up. Last year, the company promoted two Americans to top management roles. Mark King, who previously ran the golf division TaylorMade, is now overseeing the North America business, while Eric Liedtke is taking care of the group\u2019s brands. Adidas has also hired three of Nike\u2019s top designers to join its newly established design studio in Brooklyn \u2013 a more trendy workplace than the company\u2019s headquarters in the rural Bavarian town of Herzogenaurach. Finally the company signed Kanye West, who previously was Nike\u2019s brand ambassador. In Thursday\u2019s earnings call Hainer did not want to comment on how much Adidas pays for the rapper\u2019s commitment. Analysts estimate it to be a multi-million dollar investment. West himself said earlier this year that Nike has offered him $4m per year to stay, but had disappointed him by failing to offer royalties. Adidas spends more than 13% of annual sales on marketing, which is above the industry average of around 10%. Despite the frenzy among Kanye fans whenever a new \u201cYeezy\u201d goes on sale, industry experts are doubtful about the size of the benefit it brings to Adidas. \u201cSuch collaborations will continue to help the company\u2019s brands bolster sales in the short term, but they are unlikely to provide a significant boost to long term revenues\u201d, says Natasha Cazin, analyst at Euromonitor International. Stars come and go, and so do customers and their fashion preferences. \u201cYoung consumers are not as loyal as their older counterparts, they switch brands quite often\u201d, says Metzelder. Brands can soon be forgotten, he adds. \u201cWho would have thought that a brand like Nokia could disappear?\u201d While Adidas is pushing for greater success in the US, Nike is making gains in the core business of its German rival: football. Although Adidas is official partner of the German football federation DFB until 2018 and and Fifa until 2030, some domestic stars do not feel a patriotic pull when it comes to footwear. In the World Cup final last year, Germany\u2019s Mario G\u00f6tze scored the winning goal in a pair of neon yellow Nike boots. Recently, Adidas\u2019s American rivals have targeted a long-time neglected customer group in the sportswear market: women. Nike has started a womenswear collaboration with Sacai, a Japanese label overseen by former Comme des Gar\u00e7ons designer Chitose Abe. Under Armour has also signed supermodel Gisele B\u00fcndchen for an advertising campaign. Next year the marketing battlefield will move south, from the US to Brazil for the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro. Unlike in the London and Beijing games, Adidas is not an official sponsor \u2013 this time it is Nike\u2019s turn. \u201cWe decided to use the money otherwise,\u201d Hainer said. For Adidas, the hope is that Kanye will make a significant contribution to the fightback.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Tata Steel has slashed the value of its struggling UK business by \u00a3862m, weeks after unveiling plans to make 1,200 workers redundant. However, the company \u2013 whose offer of \u00a33m to help sacked steelworkers in Scunthorpe has been described by unions as \u201cwoefully inadequate\u201d \u2013 also reported a pre-tax profit of \u00a3302m on Thursday for the three months to the end of September. Tata Steel, owned by the giant Indian conglomerate Tata, made an underlying loss of \u00a324m in Europe, but this was more than offset by a \u00a3475m underlying profit in India, boosted by \u00a3280m of asset sales. Cheap Chinese steel imports have forced down the price of European hot rolled coil \u2013 a bellwether of the region\u2019s industry. The price has slumped from \u20ac417.50 (\u00a3298) per tonne this time last year to \u20ac335 per tonne, a fall of nearly 20%, according to Steelfirst.com. Tata said its UK business had buckled under the weight of challenges including the dumping of cheap steel on to the market by China. It said British steelmaking was facing a \u201cstructurally challenging environment of weak domestic manufacturing demand, surging imports, a strong pound and steep regulatory and business costs\u201d. Industry sources said the \u00a3862m writedown, the third in as many years, meant the UK business of Tata Steel was practically worthless for accounting purposes. Its chief executive, Karl-Ulrich K\u00f6hler, called on the government to do more to prevent \u201cdumped imports, including from countries that subsidise their steelmakers\u201d. Gareth Stace, director of the industry trade body UK Steel, urged the government to speed up efforts to pull the sector back from the brink. \u201cConditions in the steel sector remain perilous with a perfect storm of high energy costs, a strong currency and unfair trade,\u201d he said. \u201cMeasures have been promised to provide the sector with breathing space through the current crisis, but we need these within weeks, not months, if we are to give companies a fighting chance on a level playing field.\u201d The twin pleas to politicians come before an emergency meeting of European Union ministers to be held on Monday to discuss the steel crisis. The business minister Sajid Javid, who will represent the UK at the summit in Brussels, said he was determined that the meeting should lead \u201cto swift action, not just [be] a talking shop\u201d. Steel industry figures have called on the government to ease the burden on British steelmakers by lowering business rates and addressing energy costs, both of which are far higher than in other major European economies. The small-business minister, Anna Soubry, hinted last week that the government planned to address those issues to prevent further job losses. But the industry is also feeling the effect of the strong pound and a huge increase in cheap steel coming from China, where heavily subsidised companies are dumping their product in Europe at bargain basement prices amid falling domestic demand. Chinese steel imports from January to June this year were 125% higher than for the same period in 2012, while China now supplies nearly a third of all European steel imports. Measures to shore up European steelmakers against the flood of Chinese steel are likely to dominate the talks in Brussels, amid suggestions that countries such as the US are doing more to protect their industries. The long-term malaise affecting the industry has seen Tata Steel write down the value of its UK business three times since it bought Corus \u2013 including the remnants of British Steel \u2013 for \u00a34.3bn in 2007. The company failed in a bid to sell its Long Products unit to US firm Klesch Group earlier this year after its billionaire head, Gary Klesch, walked away, blaming the UK government\u2019s failure to deal with high energy costs and Chinese steel imports. The Unite union is in the midst of a 45-day consultation process aimed at reducing Tata Steel\u2019s 1,200 planned job losses, affecting plants in Scunthorpe and Lanarkshire. \u201cWe\u2019re getting into the nitty gritty of those discussions and will be coming forward with alternatives,\u201d said a spokesman. \u201cIt needs action from the government but it also needs the company to hold its nerve. The danger is that you get rid of valuable skills and expertise.\u201d Tata, which also owns Jaguar Land Rover, has pledged to provide \u00a33m to help workers and business affected by around 900 job losses in Scunthorpe. The government said it would provide an additional \u00a36m. But the total sum of \u00a39m has been described as \u201cwoefully inadequate\u201d by Unite\u2019s assistant general secretary Tony Burke.",

      "bodyText": "European shares had a mixed day, but German and French markets bucked a cautious trend after positive updates from Adidas and Societe Generale, writes Nick Fletcher. After an initial rise following the Bank of England\u2019s dovish comments, the UK market fell back as investors fretted about weakness in the country\u2019s economy. The Bank hinted that UK interest rates were not likely to rise as quickly as economists had expected, but it also trimmed its growth and inflation forecasts. Weakness in commodity prices also weighed on UK shares, while there was a certain amount of caution ahead of Friday\u2019s US non-farm payroll numbers. Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets, said: Weakness in commodity stocks held down the UK benchmark index despite earnings-led gains in the property and healthcare sectors. The Bank of England signposting a longer period of monetary accommodation was taken as a sign of weakness for the UK economy. Meanwhile sterling fell as rate rise expectations receded, down from $1.5391 before the Bank\u2019s announcement to $1.5239 at the moment. Ten year gilt yields slipped 5 basis points to 1.95% while two year yields fell 7 basis points. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 fell 47.98 points or 0.75% to 6364.90 Germany\u2019s Dax added 0.39% to 10,887.74 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.64% higher at 4980.04 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 0.4% to 22,223.70 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 0.4% 10,431.2 In Greece, the Athens market dropped 3.1% to 686.59 In the US there was also caution ahead of the jobs data. Wall Street is currently up just 5 points. On that note, it\u2019s time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. The Bank of England announcement was not dovish, said Alan Clarke at Scotiabank. It just wasn\u2019t as hawkish as people had expected. He said: If you had a blank sheet of paper and came up with: - a 2-year ahead inflation projection above target and the highest for years; - the same for the 3-year ahead; - The Governor saying that policy accommodation was more than adequate to get inflation back to target, even in the face of global weakness; and so on you wouldn\u2019t have called it dovish. We believe that if the Fed hikes in December and UK data stays firm, there is still a case for a hike in early 2016. Mark Carney also shows some sympathy with the Federal Reserve, as the markets wonder if they\u2019ll raise US borrowing costs in December. I\u2019m confident they\u2019ll make the right decision, he says. BOE governor Mark Carney is telling Bloomberg that the UK has \u2018made progress\u2019, but it\u2019s been mixed. Consumer demand remains solid. And he says it\u2019s \u201crelatively prudent\u201d to think that interest rates will rise in 2016. On the world economy, he says that China is one concern, but not the only one. He cites the ending of the commodity super-cycle, movement of capital out of emerging markets, and the slowing of the pace of structural reform and productivity growth in emerging economies generally. If you\u2019ve not heard enough from Mark Carney already, tune into Bloomberg TV where he\u2019s being interviewed now. There\u2019s lots of reaction to today\u2019s decision, and the BoE\u2019s press conference. Our economics editor, Larry Elliott, says the Bank\u2019s doves are still in charge: The latest signs from Threadneedle Street are that borrowing costs will rise at some point in 2016, but there was nothing in its dovish quarterly inflation report or from the minutes of the latest meeting of its monetary policy committee to suggest that a move was imminent. All that might change if the US Federal Reserve decides to push up US interest rates next month. In that event, financial markets would start to look for the Bank to move in the first half of next year. Writing for the FT, BNP Paribas\u2019s senior economist Richard Barwell is alarmed that there\u2019s so much consensus at the Bank: MPC members are supposed to vote according to their own individual view rather than search for what Sir Mervyn King, former BoE governor, called a \u201cfalse consensus\u201d. Yet, if that is what they are doing, it is nothing short of miraculous that nine economists could essentially agree on the appropriate stance of monetary policy meeting after meeting, year after year. Recent events have been even more remarkable: not only has there been no change in the stance of policy in the past two years, despite huge changes in the economy over that period, there has not been a single vote to loosen policy and precious few to raise rates. On the BBC website, Robert Peston has blogged about whether Carney\u2019s credibility has been hurt by his past predictions that rates could rise earlier than expected. To paraphrase master Yoda, bonkers it would be to raise interest rates in December, or January, or February - or not for some considerable time. The reason I mention Yoda is that central bank governors, like Jedi masters, are supposed to be infallible. Maybe that is a ludicrous conceit in this age of institutional transparency. But for City traditionalists, Mark Carney\u2019s predilection for giving so-called \u201cforward guidance\u201d, which seems to date to have habitually gone awry, may have damaged his authority a bit. Analysts at RBC Capital Markets believe the slowdown in emerging markets has come as a nasty shock to the Bank of England. They say: The MPC voted 8-1 to keep Bank Rate on hold at 0.5% in its November meeting. The November Inflation Report (IR) containing the Bank\u2019s latest analysis of the economic outlook struck a decidedly dovish tone though. Two main themes contributing to a more cautious tone are a i) downgrade to the global growth outlook and ii) a more persistent drag on inflation from the prior appreciation of the exchange rate. Previously the Committee had sounded moderately sanguine about a slowdown in emerging market economies but now it acknowledges performance has \u201cslowed markedly\u201d leading to a downgraded assessment. On the exchange rate theme we were told that the MPC thinks \u201cthe dampening influencing of sterling\u2019s past appreciation on inflation is expected to be persistent diminishing only slowly over the MPC\u2019s forecast period\u201d. Some economists still think the Bank will raise interest rates before the middle of next year: Martin Beck, senior economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club, agrees that the Bank was more downbeat than expected: \u201cWhile we expected a downgrade to the MPC\u2019s growth and inflation forecasts in November\u2019s Inflation Report, the MPC\u2019s latest assessment of the economy struck an unexpectedly dovish tone for interest rates. \u201cBased on market expectations that the first interest rate rise won\u2019t happen until Q1 2017, the MPC forecast that inflation would only slightly exceed the 2% target by that date. This implies the Committee\u2019s view of the appropriate timing of a rate rise is roughly in line with the market consensus. The Institute of Directors has hit out at the Bank of England for playing a \u201cdangerous game\u201d by leaving interest rates so low. Chief economist James Sproule, who has been calling in vain for a rate hike, says: \u201cCaution won out again at the Bank of England today, with the Monetary Policy Committee spooked by a worsening outlook for global growth. But, with strong consumer confidence and wages on the up, the arguments against raising interest rates from the current exceptionally low level are falling away.\u201d Sproule argues that the Bank is storing up trouble; asset prices are being forced up, consumers are putting on more debt, and capital is being misallocated. And so it begins... Savers should brace for interest rates to stay at record lows until perhaps 2017, says Maike Currie, associate investment director at Fidelity International. \u201cSuper Thursday has quickly turned into Superfluous Thursday. It\u2019s now 80 months and counting since the Bank of England has failed to push the button on rising interest rates with its surprisingly dovish stance today.... It leaves investors and retirees facing the ongoing conundrum of finding a home for their money in an environment of low inflation and low interest rates \u2013 a backdrop which typically makes for measly returns Kallum Pickering of Berenberg Bank has kindly sent a chart, showing how the BoE cut its growth forecasts today: The FT\u2019s Chris Giles reckons Carney attempted a repair job during today\u2019s press conference, which was more hawkish than the actual Inflation Report. He didn\u2019t row too far - the pound is still down heavily. The pound has been thumped against all major currencies since the Bank of England unleashed its unexpectedly dovish inflation report. That highlights that investors expect rates to remain at record lows for at least another year. If this was a \u201cSuper Thursday\u201d club night*, you\u2019d probably be entitled to a refund. * - these still exist, right? Press conference over. Hacks scramble back to base, Mark Carney and colleagues return to protecting the monetary affair of the nation. I\u2019ll pull some reaction together now. Business Insider\u2019s Mike Bird asks Carney about the possibility that UK interest rates could be lowered from 0.5%. He cites recent comments from ECB chief Mario Draghi on this issue of zero interest-rate policy, suggesting that borrowing costs could go lower than previously thought. Carney replies that the MPC did not consider easing monetary policy today. But it could potentially lower borrowing costs if needed. Reuters snapped the key points: BANK OF ENGLAND\u2019S CARNEY - IF WE EVER NEEDED TO, WE COULD CUT RATES BELOW CURRENT LEVEL BANK OF ENGLAND\u2019S CARNEY - FACT WE ARE NOT AT ZERO LOWER BOUND WEAKENS ARGUMENT FOR NOT RAISING INTEREST RATES That seems to have knocked the pound, it\u2019s down 1.5 cents or 1% at $1.5230. Mind you, that could be the impact of Mike\u2019s wardrobe.... Q: What discussions has the BoE had with other central banks about the possibility that monetary policy diverges next year, with the UK and US may raising rates while the eurozone and Japan could get more stimulus? It feels like we meet almost continually, says Carney wearily. We\u2019ll be meeting again next week in Basel. We don\u2019t sit there saying \u2018here\u2019s what I told that press conference but here\u2019s what we really think\u2019, he promises And he also insists that monetary policy isn\u2019t secretly agreed in advance: There is no major central bank that knows what it is going to do at its next meeting. They all have frameworks and objectives, and the factors that influence its decisions. And in all Carney\u2019s years as a G7 central bank governor in Canada and the UK, this has only changed once: The only time that was different was the depth of 2008, when we agreed to do certain things. That was the wild days of October 2008, when the world banks announced co-ordinated rate cuts to try to calm the global panic. Yield curves (which show investors\u2019 expectations of rate hikes) have not matched up to the Bank\u2019s own forecasts. So how worried is the governor that he\u2019s losing credibility in the markets? Carney insists that he\u2019s \u201cnot at all\u201d concerned about this. One can read too much into market yield curves. Q: Some of this summer\u2019s market mayhem was caused by speculation that US interest rates might rise soon, so are central banks making the situation worse? Deputy governor Minouche Shafik agrees that there was significant volatility this summer - with the VIX index (which measures this) hitting its highest level since 2011. But volatility has dropped back since, suggesting the markets are operating as they should. We\u2019re returning to how things were before the Great Moderation, Shafik adds. Our Katie Allen asks Carney about the Bank\u2019s belief that the UK economy is \u2018resilient\u2019 despite the government\u2019s fiscal consolidation (George Osborne\u2019s ongoing attempts to eliminate the deficit). Q: Should we expect major changes to these forecasts in February, once we\u2019ve seen the Autumn Statement? We have incorporated the current fiscal plans into our forecasts, Carney says. We\u2019ll make adjustment if the government\u2019s fiscal stance changes but we won\u2019t react to rumour. And he notes that this fiscal consolidation is \u201cmaterial\u201d, and has had a significant impact on the UK economy. What are households expect to make of things? Many people expect rates to go up in the next year, Carney replies, and that\u2019s a \u201creasonable\u201d idea. Governor Carney isn\u2019t spoiling us with too many straight answers. Here\u2019s the proof that the markets have been consistently wrong about UK interest rates going up: Chris Giles of the Financial Times points out that house price inflation is running at 9% (according to the Halifax). So, does the Bank need to unleash some macro-prudential tools to cool the housing market while it leaves rates so low? Mark Carney agrees that the housing market appears to be picking up, and unsecured credit is growing too. We do have to think about the balance in the recovery, and the potential implication of the continuation of those development...And that does bring into scope some macro-prudential issues. That sounds like a YES. So what might it mean? In theory, the Bank could impose tougher lending rules on banks and building societies to cool the market. Q: The Federal Reserve says it could raise interest rates in December; Could the Bank of England say the same about the first half of 2016? Mark Carney won\u2019t be lured into any predictions. We take a decision each month, based on many factors, and we are committed to getting inflation back to target, he says. Sky News Ed Conway\u2019s asks whether we should even bother looking at market expectations for bank rate (a key part of today\u2019s inflation report). Five years ago, market expected rates to be 3.75% today. A year ago, they expected 1%, so should we stop paying attention? Carney says that the Bank doesn\u2019t endorse these expectations. Ed squeezes in a second question - is there something \u2018chronic\u2019 wrong with the UK economy that means rates are still so low, or have we just suffered a series of unfortunate events? Ben Broadbent, deputy governor, responds, points out that the equilibrium inflation rate has been falling for many years, even before the financial crisis. \u201cThere are deep global forces that were at work here - including demographics\u201d Therefore the level of official interest rates aren\u2019t an arbitrary choice. - we are responding to the situation. Our ambition is to return \u2018sustainably\u2019 to the inflation target, Carney says, rather than blunder by trying to fight the \u2018persistent\u2019 factors keeping prices low. Robert Peston has the microphone, and uses it like a laser beam to target Carney\u2019s credibility. Q: Do you regret telling the public that the decision over UK interest rates will come into \u2018sharper relief\u2019 at the turn of the year? Absolutely not, Carney replies. He was giving his own view, but it\u2019s a decision for the full MPC Also, growth has ticked down in recent months, but domestic conditions have evolved rather as the Bank expected. \u201cForeign effect\u201d are to blame for weak inflation expectations. We have a situation where there is mixed progress, but there is progress.... towards monetary normalisation. Onto questions: Q: Not much appears to have changed in today\u2019s Inflation Report, but there\u2019s a big reaction in the markets. Why? Mark Carney says there have been some important changes since early August (the last meeting). Firstly: Demand for risk-free assets has risen, and there\u2019s been \u201ca sharp selloff in risk assets\u201d. Bank funding costs are up, credit spreads are up, equity markets have fallen. There\u2019s been \u201ca big unwind\u201d. Secondly: concerns over the emerging markets has risen. Now this is interesting. Carney says that the Bank expects to keep its stock of UK government bonds until interest rates have reached a level where they can be cut. That means the BoE won\u2019t be unwinding QE until rates have hit 2%. There are a range of views among the monetary policy committee over the balance of risks to inflation, says Carney. Mark Carney confirms that UK inflation is expected to remain below 1% until the second half of 2016, citing factors such as cheaper commodity prices and other imported goods prices. \u201cRemember, remember the 5th of November\u201d grins Mark Carney as the press conference begins (maybe he\u2019ll hand out some toffee apples later #hint) So what\u2019s memorable about today? There are some familiar themes - inflation remains low, rates remain unchanged, and it\u2019s another 8-1 split. But there are some subtle but significant shifts in the picture since August. Global developments are the biggest change in the last three months; these post a downside risk to the UK economy. But the UK economy is more encouraging, he adds. Domestic momentum remains resilient, as does consumer confidence, while firms still have robust inflation intentions. The Bank of England press conference is starting now - you can watch it live here. Economics editor ITV\u2019s Robert Peston (BBC today, ITV soon) is preparing to give Carney a grilling Here\u2019s Katie Allen\u2019s story on the Bank of England rate decision: The Bank of England has sent a reassuring message to businesses and households that interest rates are to remain at their record low well into next year as it cut its forecast for near-term inflation. The central bank signalled in its latest Inflation Report that interest rates would need to rise at some point from the current 0.5%, but it gave no indication a move was imminent and reiterated that when borrowing costs do go up, they will do so only gradually. Rates have been at 0.5% since the depths of the global financial crisis more than six years ago. Minutes from the Bank\u2019s latest rate-setting meeting, published alongside the report, showed that only one of the nine monetary policy committee members felt it was now time to start hiking. Ian McCafferty dissented from the rest of the MPC, as he has done in recent months, based on risks that inflation would start to pick up. The Bank\u2019s quarterly outlook said that based on recent falls in oil and other commodity prices, \u201cinflation is likely to remain lower than previously expected until late 2017\u201d and return to the government-set target of 2% in around two years\u2019 time, then rise above it. The latest official figures put inflation at -0.1%. The report also flagged a weaker outlook for global growth than at the time of its last forecasts in August and the MPC downgraded the prospects for emerging market economies. Such an outlook would continue to influence the UK economy and the path of interest rates. Here\u2019s the full story: The Bank also flags up that market expectations of future interest rate rises have fallen since August: It says: Short-term interest rates in the United Kingdom, United States and euro area were lower in the run-up to the November Report than three months earlier. While some of those falls may reflect lower expectations of the most likely path for policy, given the weaker outlook for global growth and inflation, some could also reflect increased perceptions of downside risks. This chart explains why the Bank of England is worried about emerging markets: The Bank\u2019s new quarterly inflation report is online here (as a pdf). It is packed with interesting charts. These two show that the UK economy will take a serious hit if China suffers a hard landing.A 3% drop in Chinese growth wipes 0.3% off UK GDP. The Bank says: As in August, Chinese growth is projected to continue to moderate gently in the near term. But recent financial market developments have highlighted the challenges faced by the authorities in maintaining growth while both liberalising and rebalancing the Chinese economy..... A sharp slowing in China could affect the UK economy. Carney also told Osborne that inflation should start to pick up, from zero, in early 2016: The Bank has also released a letter from governor Carney to chancellor George Osborne, explaining why he hasn\u2019t managed to keep inflation on target. He blames international factors such as cheaper oil and metals, the strength of sterling (pushing down the cost of imports) and limited earnings growth (although real wages are finally rising). This chart of inflation forecasts shows exactly why the Bank isn\u2019t rushing to raise borrowing costs: The key message from the Bank is that the UK still needs record low borrowing costs to ward off the global downturn: Peter Hemington, partner at accountancy firm BDO LLP, says the Bank of England made the right decision, given signs that UK growth is weakening amid a global slowdown. \u201cWith rates so low, policymakers must act to insulate the UK economy from the increasingly gloomy global economic outlook. So far our recovery has largely been based on consumer spending, but we need business and public sector investment if we are to rebalance the economy, boost productivity and make sure that companies thrive across the country. This will put the economy on the firmest possible footing for the potentially shaky months ahead.\u201d You can read the minutes of today\u2019s meeting yourselves, here. The Bank also reminds us that when (but when?!) Bank Rate does begin to rise, it is expected to do so more gradually and to a lower level than in recent cycles. The Bank of England remains fairly optimistic about the domestic UK economy. The minutes say: Domestic momentum remains resilient. Consumer confidence is firm, real income growth this year is expected to be the strongest since the crisis, and investment intentions remain robust. As a result, domestic demand growth has been solid despite the fiscal consolidation.... Robust private domestic demand is expected to produce sufficient momentum to eliminate the margin of spare capacity over the next year. But with few inflationary pressures, and worries over the global economy, eight members of the committee voted to leave interest rates at 0.5%. DOWN GOES THE POUND. Sterling is tumbling like a wounded hawk, as traders scramble to react to the Bank\u2019s downgraded forecasts. Sterling was trading at $1.5391 before the news broke, and it\u2019s now dropped to $1.5312. The Bank has also cut its inflation forecasts. It now expects the Consumer Prices Index to remain below 1% until the second half of 2016, far from the official target of 2%. The Bank of England has also cut its forecasts for economic growth in 2015 and 2016. In a gloomy statement, it reveals that it is less optimistic about the UK economy. The outlook for global growth has weakened since the August Inflation Report. Many emerging market economies have slowed markedly and the Committee has downgraded its assessment of their medium-term growth prospects. And the Bank also fears trouble in emerging markets: While growth in advanced economies has continued and broadened, the Committee nonetheless expects the overall pace of UK-weighted global growth to be more modest than had been expected in August. There remain downside risks to this outlook, including that of a more abrupt slowdown in emerging economies. The BoE also voted 9-0 to leave its quantitative easing programme unchanged, meaning it will still hold \u00a3375bn of UK gilts. Ian McCafferty was the only MPC policy maker to vote to hike to 0.75% again. That has dashed speculation that Kristin Forbes or Martin Weale would join him on the hawks perch. BREAKING: The Bank of England has voted 8-1 to leave interest rates unchanged, at the current record low of 0.5%. A Bank of England official is phoning the speaking clock right now.... (seriously). ONE MINUTE TO GO! Spoiler alert: Reminder: We get the monetary policy decision at noon, along with the latest quarterly inflation report. Then there\u2019s a 45 minute wait until Mark Carney faces the press pack. Over at the Bank, they\u2019ll be putting the finishing touches to their announcements -- we can expect some rapidfire tweeting once the clock strikes 12. That\u2019s also the moment that economics correspondents are released from their lock-in. Fleet Street\u2019s finest have been confined in the Bank this morning, getting an early peek at the Inflation Report. My colleague Katie Allen is in Guardian colours.... Here are some key points to watch for from the Bank of England today: The timing of a rate rise: Financial markets are pricing in the first rate hike in autumn 2016, but economists believe it will come sooner. Today\u2019s data could force one side to rethink. The latest economic forecasts: Global inflation and growth look weaker since the Bank\u2019s last big meeting, in August, so we could get downgrades today. The EU referendum. Is the Bank worried that Britain could vote to leave the EU? How much damage is the Brexit risk already causing? How the MPC votes. A second policymaker could join Ian McCafferty and vote to raise rates, or the committee could split 8-1 once again How the pound reacts. A hawkish performance from Mark Carney at the press conference could drive sterling up, which would not please exporters. Marketwatch\u2019s preview has more details: 5 things to watch for the Bank of England\u2019s Super Thursday The mood in the City is rather subdued today, as investors wait for the Bank of England to unleash a plethora of announcements and reports at noon. The FTSE 100 has lost 27 points, under-performing the rest of Europe. It\u2019s been pulled down by the mining sector, and supermarket chain Morrisons which posted a 2.6% drop in sales. Alastair McCaig, Market Analyst at IG, predicts few surprises from the BoE today. Last quarter\u2019s Super Thursday was not that super and it is difficult to see where the shock and awe will come from this time round. City traders will have to digest a plethora of data in quick succession, with a rate decision, policy minutes and the inflation report all followed by a speech from Mark Carney. We might see another member vote for change but other than a 7-2 result it would be hard to see any change being viewed as anything other than forced. Despite the emissions scandal, Volkswagen still had two cars in the top-ten bestsellers in the UK last month. This chart from today\u2019s report shows that Golfs and Polos remained popular: And VW insiders are playing down suggestions that customers are shunning it. ITV business editor Joel Hills says: \u201cIt could have been a lot worse\u201d a source at VW tells me. \u201cUK sales are pretty robust\u201d. VW\u2019s Golf and Polo models moved up the best-seller list. Experienced City economist George Magnus, adviser to UBS, is on Bloomberg TV now, arguing that there is no reason for the Bank of England to raise rates yet. Instead, Mark Carney and colleagues should wait and let the US Federal Reserve make the first move (possibly at its December meeting). Magnus says: The danger if the Bank steals a march on the Fed it could push up the pound, which is bad for manufacturing. Magnus also warned that the upcoming EU referendum is the \u201cbig unknown, hanging over the economy like a big black cloud\u201d. Two hours to go until the Bank of England begins the Super Thursday party: The SMMT says it is too early to tell if the drop in VW sales is due to the emission scandal. Mike Hawes, SMMT Chief Executive, argues that the UK car sector is still robust, even though sales growth has finally dipped. \u201cThe UK car market has gone through a period of unprecedented growth and, so far, 2015 has been a bumper year with the strongest performance since the recession. As expected, demand has now begun to level off but the sector is in a strong position, as low interest rates, consumer confidence and exciting new products combine to attract new car buyers. The current full-year growth forecast remains on track.\u201d Volkswagen sales in the UK have fallen, suggesting the company has been hurt by the news that it faked emission test results. Sales of Volkswagen-branded models tumbled by 9.8% year-on-year in October, from 15,495 to 13,970, according to the SMMT\u2019s new report. That means its market share shrank from 8.62% to 7.86%. Other VW brands saw sales fall. SEAT sales tumbled by 32%, from 3,450 to 2,338, while Skoda dipped by 3%. Audi, though, posted a 3% jump in sales compared to a year ago, even though it has been caught up in the scandal. And it\u2019s worth noting that other carmakers had a bad month. Sales of Minis (part of the BMW group) fell by a fifth from 5,262 to 4,112. But it\u2019s certainly not great news for VW, on top of the plunge in South Korean sales reported this morning (see 7.50am post) Just in. UK car sales have fallen, for the first time since early 2012. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders reports that new registrations were down 1.1% in October, compared with a year ago. Sales so far this year are still 6.4% higher than in 2015, but it looks like the long run of post-recession growth is finally tailing off: Here\u2019s the key points from the SMMT\u2019s sales report: New car registrations see 1.1% decline in October following period of phenomenal record growth. Total market year-to-date up 6.4% to 2,274,550 units registered \u2013 the best performance on record. Alternatively fuelled vehicle market enjoys 13.8% boost, with diesel and petrol registrations steady. Just looking at the detail of the report now.... Jeremy Cook, chief economist at currency firm World First, reckons UK interest rates will remain at their record lows for another six months. London newspaper City AM runs a \u2018shadow MPC\u2019, asking nine senior economists how they would vote. And this month, it has split 6-3, with a trio calling for a rate hike. One of the \u201cshadow hawks\u201d is Simon Ward of Henderson Global Investors, who argues: Raise. Corporate liquidity is surging. Private pay growth is over three per cent, while productivity remains sluggish. Global risks have faded. Andrew Sentance, who once served on the MPC, also believes the BoE should raise rates: Here\u2019s a handy chart showing which BoE policymakers appear keen to raise rates soon, and which are reluctant.... Andy Haldane, the premier Dove, has even suggested recently that rates might be cut to new record lows.... Some economists believe that divisions at the Bank of England over interest rate policy will widen today during Super Thursday. At recent meetings, the monetary policy committee has split 8-1, with only Ian McCafferty voting to hike borrowing costs from 0.5% to 0.75%. But a 7-2 split can\u2019t be ruled out, or even a 6-3 (although that might be pushing it). And that\u2019s why Simon Wells, chief UK economist at HSBC, says today does feel like a \u201cbig day\u201d. He told Bloomberg TV: It\u2019s Bonfire Night, and if there are fireworks here, it will be in the vote. Kristin Forbes has been very hawkish of late, and she may go and join McCafferty, and possibly Martin Weale too. The markets would \u201creact strongly\u201d to a 6-3 split, probably driving the pound sharply higher on expectations of an early rate hike. Wells expects that first rise will come in February 2016, so the BoE may be keen to communicate that today. Today is probably the Bank of England\u2019s last chance to prepare people for an interest rate hike early next year. Brian Hilliard, chief U.K. economist at Societe Generale, explains: \u201cIt\u2019s make or break for clear communication on a first-quarter rate increase. \u201cIf it is going to happen in February they\u2019re going to have to send a strong and clear signal.\u201d As if the Volkswagen scandal wasn\u2019t bad enough, Germany\u2019s factories have also suffered another drop in demand orders. Industrial orders fall by 1.7% in September, new figures show, the third monthly decline in a row. That\u2019s rather worse than expected - economists forecast a 1% rise - and it suggests Europe\u2019s largest economy is suffering from weaknesses overseas. The economy ministry didn\u2019t try to sugar-coat the figures either, saying that \u201coverall, industrial orders are in a weak phase\u201d. We have firm evidence that the emissions scandal has hurt Volkswagen, from South Korea. Sales to South Korean customers almost halved in October, new figures show, dropping below the 1,000 mark for the first time since 2011. The Korea Automobile Importers &amp; Distributors Association reported that VW only sold 947 cars last month, following the revelations that it used software to cheat nitrogen oxide emission tests. That\u2019s 46% lower than a year ago, and 67% below September\u2019s figures. The sales collapse for Volkswagen contrasted with a 6% rise in sales of imported cars in South Korea in the same period, Reuters points out. Have UK drivers also abandoned VW? We find out at 9am when the latest sales figures are released.... Happy Super Thursday! The Bank of England is preparing to hit us with a quadruple whammy of news and economic data at noon. Firstly, the Bank\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee will set UK interest rates. A rate rise isn\u2019t expected, but some members of the MPC may vote for the first hike since the financial crisis began. Last month they split 8-1, but could another hawk jump the fence? The minutes of the meeting are also released at noon, showing the details of the committee\u2019s discussions and its views on the UK and global economy. We also get the latest quarterly inflation report, packed with new economic forecasts. And if that\u2019s not enough of a treat, the Bank governor Mark Carney then holds a press conference at 12.45pm. That\u2019s his opportunity to guide the markets - and potential housebuyers and borrowers - on the chances of an interest rate rise in early 2016. Also coming up today.... We get new UK car sales figures for October at 9am. They are expected to show that some customers have deserted Volkswagen following its emissions crisis. In the City, we have some disappointing results from Morrisons, which has reported its 15th straight quarterly sales fall. And the European financial markets are expected to be calm, after a solid trading day in Asia which saw the Chinese market rise 20% above its recent low. That means they are back into a bull market, as traders put this summer\u2019s panic selling behind them. We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day....",

Ian McCafferty dissented from the rest of the MPC, as he has done in recent months, based on risks that inflation would start to pick up.</p> <p>The Bank\u2019s quarterly outlook said that based on recent falls in oil and other commodity prices, \u201cinflation is likely to remain lower than previously expected until late 2017\u201d and return to the government-set target of 2% in around two years\u2019 time, then rise above it. The latest official figures put inflation at -0.1%.</p> <p>The report also flagged a weaker outlook for global growth than at the time of its last forecasts in August and the MPC downgraded the prospects for emerging market economies. Such an outlook would continue to influence the UK economy and the path of interest rates.</p> </blockquote> <p>Here\u2019s the full story:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/nov/05/interest-rate-bank-of-england-leave-record-low-decision\">Bank of England leaves interest rates at record  low of 0.5%</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-563b4dd4e4b090d28493c655\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-11-05T12:39:51.075Z\">12.39pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The Bank also flags up that market expectations of future interest rate rises have fallen since August:</strong></p> <p>It says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Short-term interest rates in the United Kingdom, United States and euro area were lower in the run-up to the November Report than three months earlier.</p> <p>While some of those falls may reflect lower expectations of the most likely path for policy, given the weaker outlook for global growth and inflation, some could also reflect increased perceptions of downside risks.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"82f90735686cc1307bb2c1ea387657cd5af7c0b5\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/11/5/1446727186218/8cec30cb-3f64-4a98-80a3-e13e5729944e-460x366.png\" alt=\"Bank of England inflation report\" width=\"460\" height=\"366\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2015-11-05T12:39:57.084Z\">at 12.39pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-563b4d61e4b090d28493c651\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-11-05T12:37:32.698Z\">12.37pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>This chart explains why the Bank of England is worried about emerging markets:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"674bf7f6489d4918c37da7e1b2529c934456703f\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/11/5/1446727035275/1f9b8247-35c4-443d-a991-c174020e1950-378x420.png\" alt=\"Bank of England quarterly inflation report\" width=\"378\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-563b4cd8e4b0990af738c2b2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-11-05T12:36:41.661Z\">12.36pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The Bank\u2019s new quarterly inflation report is <a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Documents/inflationreport/2015/nov.pdf\">online here (as a pdf)</a>.</strong></p> <p>It is packed with interesting charts.</p> <p>These two show that the UK economy will take a serious hit if China suffers a hard landing.A 3% drop in Chinese growth wipes 0.3% off UK GDP.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9427d7c9134981fb8d10f82b7c0d2afc877231f3\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/11/5/1446726975079/33d7d36d-1475-4a16-ae22-52beebefbdec-460x371.png\" alt=\"Bank of England quarterly inflation report\" width=\"460\" height=\"371\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cdcd944f9c12f54b05ffa8fffd3bdf5b4d30664f\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/11/5/1446726991123/853c0c22-75f1-4eba-ac3c-f8e605c2ce37-460x255.png\" alt=\"Bank of England quarterly inflation report\" width=\"460\" height=\"255\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The Bank says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>As in August, Chinese growth is projected to continue to moderate gently in the near term.

      "bodyText": "It has become a familiar refrain from the Bank of England. Interest rates are going up \u2013 but not quite yet. The latest signs from Threadneedle Street are that borrowing costs will rise at some point in 2016, but there was nothing in its dovish quarterly inflation report or from the minutes of the latest meeting of its monetary policy committee to suggest that a move was imminent. All that might change if the US Federal Reserve decides to push up US interest rates next month. In that event, financial markets would start to look for the Bank to move in the first half of next year. But for now there is little to suggest that homeowners should be worried. Despite rumblings from various MPC members, including the governor, Mark Carney, that they are thinking about tightening policy, only one of the nine has been prepared to vote for it. Ian McCafferty was again alone in calling for a quarter-point rate rise this month. So why is the Bank so relaxed? In part it is because inflation is much lower than was expected a year ago and is forecast to rise more slowly than anticipated. The halving of oil prices in late 2014 came as a surprise to the Bank, as did the second bout of weakness over the summer. Falling energy prices reflect the poorer outlook for global growth, with the Bank expressing concern about the health of some of the bigger emerging market economies. It is not, however, the only factor keeping inflation low. An 18% increase in the value of sterling since its March 2013 trough has made imports cheaper (and exports dearer), and wage growth has not been as strong as the Bank envisaged given the fall in unemployment. These factors are expected to persist, offsetting any inflationary pressure generated by the domestic UK economy. At home, the Bank is confident that demand will remain robust despite the chancellor\u2019s plans to cut Whitehall spending and reduce the welfare bill. It says consumer confidence is firm, businesses are looking to invest and that real incomes are rising more strongly than at any time since the financial crisis. All these factors \u2013 oil, sterling, modest pay increases by historic standards and robust domestic demand \u2013 are seen as balancing each other out. The result, if the Bank is right, will be a Goldilocks economy during 2016 \u2013 neither too hot nor too cold. Inflation is now forecast to remain below 1% until the second half of next year and it will not be until 2017 that it returns to the government\u2019s 2% target. Interest rates will need to be tweaked at some point next year, but it will just be a tweak. The Bank has announced that it would wait until official interest rates hit 2% before it starts to run down its \u00a3375bn stock of bonds bought under the quantitative easing programme that boosted the money supply when growth was weak. Judged by the Bank\u2019s latest analysis, that is years rather than months away.",

      "bodyText": "National Grid spent millions of pounds seeking to prevent power shortages on Wednesday after using all but one of its \u201csafety nets\u201d. The electricity transmission firm revealed it was forced to call on a range of measures when power reserves ran low, including buying power at short notice and asking industrial users to turn down their usage. National Grid spent at least \u00a32.5m after issuing a notice of inadequate system margin (NISM) on Wednesday afternoon asking power companies to provide more electricity. It paid the owner of Severn power station, Calon, about \u00a32,500 per megawatt hour to provide an extra 500MW for two hours. On a normal day the typical cost for immediate power would be closer to \u00a360 per megawatt hour. National Grid also used one of two new powers designed to prevent power cuts. These have already cost the National Grid \u00a336.5m to put in place \u2013 adding 50p to the average annual household energy bill \u2013 but incur extra costs when called on. The first of these, the demand side balancing reserve (DSBR), saw companies agree to turn down the amount of power they were using by 40 megawatts. This is likely to have cost considerably less than \u00a31m, according to a high-level industry source. Flexitricity, a firm involved in the power demand reduction, said most of it was achieved by asking companies to turn off unnecessary air-conditioning. \u201cAt this time of year, there are often problems at power stations because of the end of the summer maintenance season,\u201d the company\u2019s chief strategy officer, Dr Alastair Martin. The margin between supply and demand was \u201ctighter than it has been for decades\u201d, he said, but the firm had \u201cseveral hundred megawatts across the portfolio which is ready in case things get worse\u201d. National Grid had only one other safety mechanism left at its disposal. Known as the supplemental balancing reserve (SBR), it would have involved paying companies to fire up mothballed power stations. But industry figures said it would take several hours for the extra power to become available. That would have left Britain flirting with the possibility of \u201cbrownouts\u201d \u2013 when lights are dimmed to prevent full-scale outages. \u201cThey went through three of their safety nets, so they certainly would have been nervous,\u201d said Peter Atherton, an energy analyst at stockbroker Jefferies. \u201cTheir big danger would have been when it got dark and there was no wind around. If [Britain\u2019s biggest power station] Sizewell had suddenly gone down, that would have been your nightmare scenario. It takes a while for power stations to fire up, you need a few hours\u2019 notice.\u201d Labour\u2019s energy spokeswoman said the government\u2019s energy policy was increasing the risk of power cuts. \u201cNational Grid has now begun using emergency measures to prevent blackouts,\u201d Lisa Nandy said. \u201cThe chopping and changing of energy policy under this government is creating an energy security crisis. It is preventing investment we now urgently need to keep the lights on and it could cause household bills to rise. David Cameron should step in and end the policy vacuum to get new power stations built as quickly as possible.\u201d Energy analysts said while a cold winter might not greatly increase the risk of power cuts, because most heating is supplied by gas, it could pose further problems for National Grid. If the company issues another NISM, it could be charged high prices that would eventually raise household energy bills. The problems faced by National Grid on Wednesday were also likely to have affected small energy companies, many of which buy power at short notice. Market watchers said energy prices surged nearly tenfold after National Grid issued its warning, from \u00a355 per megawatt hour to \u00a3500.",

      "bodyText": "The Bank of England is ready to step up controls on the housing market if a prolonged period of record low interest rates risks inflating a property bubble, governor Mark Carney has said. As he signalled that interest rates were likely to remain on hold well into next year, Carney suggested the Bank may have to revert to other measures, such as tighter lending rules, to keep a lid on house prices. Speaking after news from lender Halifax that house prices had jumped almost 10% from a year ago, he raised concerns that households were saving less and that some would end up overstretching themselves. More action could be warranted from the Bank, which has the power to clamp down further on mortgage lending as part of its macro-prudential tools. \u201cWe do see house price growth picking up, and in fact we see activity in the housing market picking up,\u201d Carney said. \u201cWe are conscious of those developments, and as an institution as a whole, we do have to think about the balance in the recovery and the potential financial stability implications of those developments, or the accentuation of those developments, and that does bring into scope some macro-prudential considerations.\u201d Financial markets pushed back the chances of a rate rise over coming months following the Bank\u2019s latest forecast for inflation to stay close to zero for now and rise only slowly next year. Minutes from the Bank\u2019s latest meeting released alongside those forecasts showed that only one member of the nine-strong monetary policy committee felt now was the time to start raising interest rates after more than six years at a record low of 0.5%. As in recent months, Ian McCafferty felt there was enough inflationary pressure to vote for a rate rise to 0.75%. The rest of the committee disagreed and, reflecting a broad range of views in recent speeches, the minutes highlighted divisions among policymakers over the outlook for troubled emerging markets such as China, inflation and growth. \u201cThis does not look like a committee that is of a mind to push rates up any time soon,\u201d said Philip Shaw, economist at broker Investec. But Carney was at pains to remind households and businesses that borrowing costs will eventually have to rise, and he warned them to prepare for a move next year. He cited surveys suggesting two-thirds of households expect a rate rise over the coming 12 months. \u201cGiven these forecasts, that is a reasonable expectation,\u201d he told a press conference. He later underscored that message in a television interview. \u201cWould I rather have the majority of the British people thinking that rates are likely to go up in the next year, which is the case today? Yes I would, because that is reasonably prudent behaviour, given the progress this economy is making,\u201d he told Bloomberg Television. The Bank used its latest Inflation Report to reassure borrowers and businesses that when interest rates do start to rise, they will do so only slowly, and to a lower level than in the past. \u201cAll members agree that, given the likely persistence of the headwinds weighing on the economy, when the Bank rate does begin to rise, it is expected to do so more gradually and to a lower level than in recent cycles. This guidance is an expectation, not a promise,\u201d said Carney. The governor, who is almost halfway through a five-year term, said in July that the decision over when to start raising rates \u201cwill likely come into sharper relief around the turn of this year\u201d. Since then, global growth has lost momentum, while in the UK, low oil prices and cheap imports have pulled inflation down to below zero \u2013 way off the Bank\u2019s target of 2%. Asked if he regretted that earlier guidance on rate rise decisions, Carney said: \u201cAbsolutely not. No regrets.\u201d The Bank\u2019s quarterly outlook said that based on recent falls in oil and other commodity prices, \u201cinflation is likely to remain lower than previously expected until late 2017\u201d and return to the target of 2% in about two years\u2019 time, then rise above it. The report also flagged a weaker outlook for global growth than at the time of the Bank\u2019s last forecasts in August, with the MPC on Thursday downgrading the prospects for emerging market economies. Such an outlook would continue to influence the UK economy and the path of interest rates. Policymakers were more upbeat about the UK domestic outlook. \u201cDomestic momentum remains resilient. Consumer confidence is firm, real income growth this year is expected to be the strongest since the crisis, and investment intentions remain robust,\u201d the report said. But Carney conceded that the government\u2019s spending cuts had been \u201cmaterial\u201d and economists warned that there will be further pressures on the UK economy when the next round of austerity is revealed by chancellor George Osborne at his spending review later this month. \u201cTogether with persistence of emerging markets and currency-related headwinds, 2016 will bring new challenges for the UK, including fiscal tightening and uncertainty about the EU referendum,\u201d said Anna Stupnytska, global economist at Fidelity International. \u201cThis means that once the first hike is out of the way, the pace thereafter is likely to be extremely slow. The BoE will have to continue treading with caution.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Jes Staley, the newly appointed chief executive of Barclays, has spent \u00a36.4m buying shares in the bank. The former banker at JP Morgan and hedge fund manager will take over on 1 December and faces pressure from shareholders to set out plans for the troublesome investment banking business. The 58-year-old has bought 2.8m shares at 233p \u2013 the lowest price at which they have traded since January. Barclays has a policy that directors should own shares worth four times their salaries, which Staley has now achieved, as his salary is \u00a31.2m. However, his total remuneration package, including his salary, a fixed pay allowance to avoid the EU cap on bonuses, annual bonuses of up to \u00a32.1m and a long-term incentive plan of \u00a33.2m, is worth \u00a310m. This also includes an estimated \u00a32m of shares to buy him out of bonuses at JP Morgan, although he is allowed to keep his stake in the hedge fund Blue Mountain, which he is leaving to take up the post. Staley replaces Antony Jenkins, who was ousted in July, and is expected to focus on growth at the bank, which has been trying to restore its reputation after a series of scandals. The American banker \u2013 who will also receive a relocation package to move to the UK \u2013 has told staff that he hopes to improve the behaviour of bankers. \u201cI feel keenly we must continue to strengthen trust in Barclays. The trust of our customers and clients, reciprocated in our commitment and service to them, is the foundation of our success, the most valuable quality we can nurture, and the key to unlocking shareholder value,\u201d Staley said. He had been considered for the role when Jenkins was appointed in the aftermath of the Libor rigging scandal, which led to the departure of Bob Diamond. But political sensitivities and the cost of hiring him are said to have led the board to select Jenkins, who was running Barclays\u2019 high street banking business at the time. Staley\u2019s purchase, intended to demonstrate a show of confidence in the bank, failed to arrest the decline in value of shares, which ended 3.2p lower on Thursday at 228p. Under the company\u2019s rules, he had five years to amass his shareholding. He is taking over as the bank braces itself for another wave of payouts to customers after admitting last month that it had set aside \u00a3290m as compensation for mistakes in the way foreign exchange deals were priced.",

Barclays has a policy that directors should own shares worth four times their salaries, which Staley has now achieved, as his salary is \u00a31.2m.</p> <p>However, his total remuneration package, including his salary, a fixed pay allowance to avoid the EU cap on bonuses, annual bonuses of up to \u00a32.1m and a long-term incentive plan of \u00a33.2m, is worth \u00a310m. This also includes an estimated \u00a32m of shares to buy him out of bonuses at JP Morgan, although he is allowed to keep his stake in the hedge fund Blue Mountain, which he is leaving to take up the post.</p> <p>Staley replaces Antony Jenkins, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/08/barclays-fires-chief-executive-antony-jenkins\">who was ousted in July</a>, and is expected to focus on growth at the bank, which has been trying to restore its reputation after a series of scandals. </p> <p>The American banker \u2013 who will also receive a relocation package to move to the UK \u2013 has told staff that he hopes to improve the behaviour of bankers. \u201cI feel keenly we must continue to strengthen trust in Barclays. The trust of our customers and clients, reciprocated in our commitment and service to them, is the foundation of our success, the most valuable quality we can nurture, and the key to unlocking shareholder value,\u201d Staley said.</p> <p>He had been considered for the role when Jenkins <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jun/27/barclays-chief-bob-diamond-bonus-fine\">was appointed in the aftermath of the Libor rigging scandal</a>, which led to the departure of Bob Diamond. But political sensitivities and the cost of hiring him are said to have led the board to select Jenkins, who was running Barclays\u2019 high street banking business at the time. </p> <p>Staley\u2019s purchase, intended to demonstrate a show of confidence in the bank, failed to arrest the decline in value of shares, which ended 3.2p lower on Thursday at 228p. Under the company\u2019s rules, he had five years to amass his shareholding.</p> <p>He is taking over as the bank braces itself <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/29/barclays-legal-bill-hits-23bn-in-nine-months\">for another wave of payouts to customers</a> after admitting last month that it had set aside \u00a3290m as compensation for mistakes in the way foreign exchange deals were priced. </p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Volkswagen\u2019s UK sales fell by almost 10% after the emissions rigging scandal, but other big carmakers also suffered steep declines as demand tailed off after a period of unprecedented growth. New car registrations in Britain slipped in October by 1.1% on last year, to 177,664, \u2013 the first drop in nearly four years \u2013 according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). Diesel car sales fell 2.1%; petrol cars were down 0.9%. Sales of VWs fell by 9.8%, while the company\u2019s Spanish Seat brand registered a much sharper decline, of 32%, and its Czech brand, \u0160koda, was down 3%. Its Audi marque was up 2.2%, however. The Volkswagen Golf is still one of the UK\u2019s bestsellers, ranking in third place last month behind the Ford Fiesta and the Vauxhall Corsa. The Volkswagen Polo was in seventh place. Other manufacturers also posted marked annual declines, with Ford sales falling 8.8%, General Motors\u2019 Vauxhall brand down 16.4% and Citro\u00ebn sales 18.5% lower. Ana Nicholls, automotive analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit, said: \u201cGiven the scale of the scandal affecting Volkswagen, the drop in its VW-branded car sales seems like a fairly modest setback, suggesting that most consumers are reserving judgment \u2013 or continue to assume that VW was not the only company overstating its fuel efficiency.\u201d This confirmed what car dealers such as Pendragon had been saying: that the VW scandal has had little impact on the brand so far, even though new revelations are still coming to light, she said. Only Seat has taken a big hit, suggesting that the brand\u2019s recent management shakeup and strategy announcement are much needed. Nicholls added: \u201cThat said, there are signs that the confidence of car buyers in the whole industry has been shaken by the VW scandal. After all, this is the first drop in car sales in the UK for three and half years, and comes at a time when confidence in other sectors of the economy (housing, retail sales) appears to be strong.\u201d The scandal widened this week when Porsche, owned by VW, got caught up in it and Volkswagen admitted \u201cirregularities\u201d in the levels of carbon dioxide emitted by 800,000 cars sold mainly in Europe. This means that it could have to repay billions of pounds in tax to European governments. The SMMT said it was too early to tell the impact from Volkswagen\u2019s emissions rigging scandal, which has affected 11m diesel vehicles worldwide. Some people pre-ordered their cars months ago. Mike Hawes, the SMMT\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cThe UK car market has gone through a period of unprecedented growth and, so far, 2015 has been a bumper year with the strongest performance since the recession. As expected, demand has now begun to level off but the sector is in a strong position, as low interest rates, consumer confidence and exciting new products combine to attract new car buyers.\u201d Other data suggests the deepening crisis at Volkswagen is starting to put customers off. The German carmaker\u2019s sales in South Korea nearly halved in October from a year earlier, falling below 1,000 vehicles for the first time in four years. Volkswagen sold 947 cars in South Korea in October, the first full month since the emissions scandal broke, according to the Korea Automobile Imports and Distributors Association. The company admitted in mid-September that it had installed software in some of its diesel vehicles designed to cheat emissions tests. The collapse in VW sales came as sales of imported cars in South Korea rose 6% in October. The BBC reported that Patrick McLoughlin, the transport secretary, had spoken to Herbert Diess, a senior VW executive who joined from BMW in July, and demanded compensation for UK drivers for any lower resale value of cars affected by the crisis. VW has agreed that payments might have to be made. Prof Andre Spicer, at Cass Business School, said the car market depended on trust because of the imbalance of expertise between the engineers who build them and the people who buy them. \u201cThe market for VWs could easily turn into what economists call \u2018a market for lemons\u2019 \u2013 that is a marketplace where there are huge imbalances of information and customers are routinely suspicious of what sellers have on offer,\u201d Spicer said. \u201cThis suspicion is likely to spread to other brands as consumers start to treat technical details as reliable as the fanciful car advertisements seen on television: they might make us feel good, but they don\u2019t describe reality.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Amec Foster Wheeler has lost more than a fifth of its value after the oil services group slashed its dividend and forecast a fall in margins. The news has wiped more than \u00a3600m off Amec\u2019s market value. With oil companies cutting capital expenditure after the crude price slump, services companies have been struggling in recent months. Amec said it expected second half margins to fall compared to the first six months, as it reported a 3.4% like for like drop in nine month revenues to \u00a33.87bn. The company said it had raised its cost cutting target by $55m to $180m by 2017 and would reduce its final dividend by a half compared to last year, to 14.2p a share. The news has sent its shares down 162p to 585p, a decline of nearly 22%. Chief executive Samir Brikho hailed the company\u2019s \u201chigh quality and diversified business\u201d and its resilient financial performance but added: However, we are not immune to the ongoing tough market conditions and we are managing the business on the assumption of an extended period of weakness. For more than a year..we have seen customers reducing capital expenditure and putting more pricing pressure on the supply chain. We see no sign of these trends changing. In the light of the ongoing market conditions, we are taking the prudent step of cutting our ordinary dividend payments by fifty per cent, starting with the final dividend for 2015. Investec analyst Neill Morton said: Covering the oil and gas sector feels like being punched in the face every morning. Today\u2019s windmill comes from Amec, with a hefty profit warning. Given its diversity, both geographically and by industry, it is rightly regarded as an industry barometer. But its asset-light, cash generative business model means the surprise is all the greater when it warns. 2016 looks tough, 2017 likely also, with any rise in the oil price no guarantee of a pick-up in customer activity. Others in the sector have also seen their shares slide. Hunting is down 11.1p at 361.8p as it too reported difficult trading conditions, saying profit from continuing operations could fall by 90%. Petrofac has fallen 57p to 816.5p and Wood Group is off 25p at 602p. Oil companies are falling too, with Tullow Oil down 15p at 218p and Premier Oil 3.85p lower at 84.15p.",

      "bodyText": "The Japanese electronics company Toshiba is bracing for huge losses as it counts the cost of an accounting scandal. The firm is expected to announce an operating loss of 90 billion yen ($US740m) for the six months through to September, according to a report in the Nikkei business daily. The losses are Toshiba\u2019s first for six years and compare with a 137.8bn yen profit in the same period last year. The Nikkei report sent Toshiba shares down by as much as 5.9% on Thursday morning to their lowest level in almost a month, before recovering slightly to 330.5 yen, down 3.6%, midway through the day. The paper, quoting anonymous sources, said the scandal had frustrated Toshiba\u2019s attempts to boost sluggish sales of consumer electronics. The 140-year-old company\u2019s product range includes TVs, computers, as well as rice cookers and other kitchen appliances. It also has a stake in the nuclear power industry. The company incurred huge losses in its home appliances unit and its point of sale equipment business, according to Japanese media reports, although its semiconductor business is expected to make a profit. Toshiba confirmed it would suffer a half-year operating loss, but would not provide figures. It has already said it will register a 37.8 billion yen net loss for the fiscal year to March 2015. Toshiba\u2019s chief executive, Hisao Tanaka, and seven top executives were forced to resign in July after it was revealed the firm overstated profits over several years by almost 152 billion yen \u2013 about three times the firm\u2019s initial estimate. In one of the most damaging corporate scandals in Japan in recent years, regulators said managers had started setting unrealistic performance targets for the firm\u2019s new businesses, such as smart meters and electronic toll booths, after the global financial crisis seven years ago. The accounting irregularities continued after the March 2011 Fukushima disaster, amid concerns Toshiba would sustain losses in its nuclear division. In their report into the scandal, investigators said: \u201cWithin Toshiba, there was a corporate culture in which one could not go against the wishes of superiors.\u201d Unusually, Toshiba won\u2019t release its first-half results until Saturday, as many of its new board members have been appointed from outside and can only attend meetings at weekends. The scandal has forced Toshiba, which employs more than 200,000 people worldwide, to embark on a round of restructuring that includes selling its shares in affiliates. The firm has said it will sell its image sensor business to Sony and is expected to announce an overhaul of its home appliance, TV and computer units later this month. Japan\u2019s government is struggling to regain the confidence of global investors after two major scandals in the past four years. In late 2011, Olympus was found to have covered up 1.7 billion US dollars in losses over 13 years.",

      "bodyText": "On Tuesday, the Reserve Bank sounded a cautiously optimistic note on the Australian economy, but as the latest retail sales figures show, that optimism seems based more on hope of what lies ahead than on recent economic activity. As a general rule, when the RBA keeps rates on hold, the governor\u2019s statement is rather dull reading. The RBA staff love to make use of cut and paste, and often large parts of the text are the same from one month to the next. This month, however, there were quite a lot of changes and some important ones that suggested a more optimistic tone. Last month, when summarising the state of the Australian economy, the RBA noted: While growth has been somewhat below longer-term averages for some time, it has been accompanied with somewhat stronger growth of employment and a steady rate of unemployment over the past year. This month the words used were exactly the same except for the addition of a new clause (new words are in bold): While GDP growth has been somewhat below longer-term averages for some time, business surveys suggest a gradual improvement in conditions over the past year. This has been accompanied by somewhat stronger growth in employment and a steady rate of unemployment. This added mention of business surveys showing better signs led to the RBA concluding rather boldly (for a central bank) that \u201cthe prospects for an improvement in economic conditions had firmed a little over recent months.\u201d This view has also been promulgated by those who suggest the new prime minister will energise the economy through renewed confidence. So it is a worry that the first business survey published after the decision was AiG\u2019s Australian performance of services index which showed a fall of 3.3 points to 48.9 (a score above 50 indicates the sector is expanding). Now there\u2019s no need to be too pessimistic, because the PSI had been one of those surveys that had been improving over the previous few months. But the dip did give a bit of pause to those who seem to believe the new prime minister will improve the economy just through improving confidence. The RBA certainly could point to surveys such as the NAB business confidence index which has been improving since the election of Tony Abbott in 2013: But in another warning to those hoping the confidence fairy will cure all economic ills, on Tuesday morning \u2013 before the RBA made its decision \u2013 the latest Dun and Bradstreet business expectations survey showed that businesses were \u201cflagging a drop in sales, selling prices, employment, profit and investment in the first quarter of 2016\u201d. The survey revealed the average measures of sales, profits, employment and investment had dropped to 17.7 points for the first quarter of 2016, down from 21.8 points for fourth quarter of 2015 \u2013 although it remains above the low of 17.2 points recorded for third quarter of this year. These dips in business confidence and expectations are rather at odds with the increases in consumer confidence reported this week in the ANZ-Roy Morgan survey: The survey showed consumer confidence rose from 110 point in September to now being 115. But that level still remains below the 20 year average of 116 points. Consumer confidence is a bit of a fickle thing, however, and is clearly linked with the popularity of the government. In general, Liberal party supporters are more confident when their party is in power. As Turnbull is more popular than Abbott, it is not surprising that people feel more confident. But will it actually change consumer behaviour? The latest retail trade figures out yesterday would indicate a need for change, because overall the figures were pretty weak. Total retail sales grew by just 3.6% over the past 12 months \u2013 the worst result in trend terms since September 2013: But a little caution needs to be taken with the figures. In September last year, the iPhone 6 release saw a massive jump in sales that means it is not too surprising that there has been a drop off in annual growth over recent months: However, even if we take away the sales figures in the \u201celectrical and electronic goods\u201d sector in order to negate the impact of the iPhone 6 sales, annual trend growth remains at a low 3.6%. The only difference is the fall over the past few months is not as great: Retail sales growth has in the past 12 months been driven by sales in the electronic goods sector, which is part of the \u201chousehold goods\u201d industry. Despite accounting for just 17% of total sales, that industry in the past year has contributed at times up to 38% of annual growth: But for now that growth appears to be over and no other industry has taken its place as the boom sector. Retailers will now be looking to see if this improved consumer confidence will translate into strong Christmas sales. And it is at that point we will get a real sense of whether the optimism the RBA sees is translating into actual economic activity. For now the RBA looks happy to sit pat with the cash rate at 2%, but it also realises \u2013 despite its hopes for a better tomorrow \u2013 that inflation is so weak that it \u201cmay afford scope\u201d for further rate cuts \u201cshould that be appropriate to lend support to demand\u201d. If the confidence brought on by Turnbull\u2019s leadership does not translate to improved activity \u2013 either via confidence or by actual government expenditure \u2013 then the RBA will almost certainly be forced to cut again next year.",

    "webTitle": "Volvo works on detection system to dodge kangaroo collisions", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Volvo is developing a kangaroo detection system designed to avoid collisions that can be deadly to man and beast. The Swedish car manufacturer has fitted some of its northern hemisphere models with systems tailored to moose and reindeer. But a senior safety engineer, Martin Magnusson, said dodging 60km/h marsupial missiles was much more challenging. \u201cKangaroos are very unpredictable animals and difficult to avoid, but we are confident we can refine our technology to detect them and avoid collisions on the highway,\u201d said Magnusson. A radar will scan the road ahead and the on-board computer will predict a kangaroo\u2019s next move. If there is time the car will warn the driver. But if a collision is imminent, the car slams on the brakes. The reaction speed is 0.05 seconds, 24 times faster than a human. \u201cIt\u2019s great that Volvo is looking at this area,\u201d said senator Ricky Muir, who represents the Australian Motoring Enthusiast party. However, he was concerned about handing over control of his vehicle to a computer. \u201cI\u2019d be reluctant to travel down a country road at dusk at highway speed in an area known for lots of kangaroos in the hope of the car autonomously avoiding any collision. If my car was to brake every time there was a kangaroo near the edge of the road, it could be a very slow trip.\u201d He also feared drivers would become complacent. But Magnusson said: \u201cThis type of technology is not designed to take responsibility away from drivers.\u201d The sensor technology was originally developed to avoid pedestrians, cars and cyclists in the city. A team of Volvo researchers will spend this week studying the roadside movements of kangaroos in a reserve near Queanbeyan. The NSW town has the nation\u2019s highest rate of insurance claims for animal collisions. Humans are regularly injured or killed in accidents involving kangaroos. Between 1996 and 2005, 22 people were killed and 17,000 injured in accidents involving animals in New South Wales. A man died near Bendigo last week when his car ran off the road as he swerved to avoid a \u2019roo. The insurance company NRMA said it received about 15,000 claims last year, costing $75m, from motorists who had hit a kangaroo. A spokeswoman said the company \u201crecognises the important role technology and innovation plays in improving the safety of our roads\u201d. But also warned drivers against over-reliance on gadgetry to the detriment of attention and care. When an animal jumps in front of a car, police and insurers recommend hitting it rather than swerving. But an adult red kangaroo can weigh 90kg, and their more common eastern grey cousins weigh 60kg to 70kg. Although this is light compared with a moose or cow, kangaroos are a particular hazard for drivers because of their speed and high centre of gravity, meaning a struck \u2019roo can fly through the windshield of a car and hit those in the front seats. Angela Crawford, the editor of the Midland Express in Victoria\u2019s Macedon ranges, said a cull had been discussed after a local woman suffered severe facial injuries when a kangaroo flew through her windscreen in May. Local smash repairers had told Crawford that 95% of their business came from kangaroo impacts. \u201cMost drivers in these parts know this and slow down at those times but there are plenty of people who simply won\u2019t drive at those times because of the risk,\u201d she said. She said kangaroo-detecting Volvos may convince country folk to look beyond the ubiquitous Holden, Toyota and Ford.",

If there is time the car will warn the driver. But if a collision is imminent, the car slams on the brakes. The reaction speed is 0.05 seconds, 24 times faster than a human.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s great that Volvo is looking at this area,\u201d said senator Ricky Muir, who represents the Australian Motoring Enthusiast party. However, he was concerned about handing over control of his vehicle to a computer.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d be reluctant to travel down a country road at dusk at highway speed in an area known for lots of kangaroos in the hope of the car autonomously avoiding any collision. If my car was to brake every time there was a kangaroo near the edge of the road, it could be a very slow trip.\u201d</p> <p>He also feared drivers would become complacent.</p> <p>But Magnusson said: \u201cThis type of technology is not designed to take responsibility away from drivers.\u201d </p> <p>The sensor technology was originally developed to avoid pedestrians, cars and cyclists in the city. A team of Volvo researchers <a href=\"https://www.media.volvocars.com/global/en-gb/media/pressreleases/168841/volvo-cars-begins-first-ever-australian-tests-for-kangaroo-safety-research\">will spend this week studying</a> the roadside movements of kangaroos in a reserve near Queanbeyan. The NSW town has <a href=\"http://www.canberratimes.com.au/act-news/kangaroorelated-road-crashes-on-rise-20141108-11hoed.html\">the nation\u2019s highest rate of insurance claims</a> for animal collisions.<br></p> <p>Humans are regularly injured or killed in accidents involving kangaroos. Between 1996 and 2005, 22 people were killed and 17,000 injured in accidents involving animals <a href=\"http://www.researchgate.net/publication/233744160_Frequency_of_animal-vehicle_collisions_in_NSW\">in New South Wales</a>. A man <a href=\"http://www.bendigoadvertiser.com.au/story/3386066/man-in-fatal-car-accident/\">died near Bendigo last week</a> when his car ran off the road as he swerved to avoid a \u2019roo.</p> <p>The insurance company NRMA said it received about 15,000 claims last year, costing $75m, from motorists who had hit a kangaroo. A spokeswoman said the company \u201crecognises the important role technology and innovation plays in improving the safety of our roads\u201d. But also warned drivers against over-reliance on gadgetry to the detriment of attention and care.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Factors contributing to road accidents in NSW (2013)\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/0pxvw/index.html\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"460\" height=\"300\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>When an animal jumps in front of a car, police and insurers recommend hitting it rather than swerving. But an adult red kangaroo can weigh 90kg, and their more common eastern grey cousins weigh 60kg to 70kg. Although this is light compared with a moose or cow, kangaroos are a particular hazard for drivers because of their speed and high centre of gravity, meaning a struck \u2019roo can fly through the windshield of a car and hit those in the front seats.</p> <p>Angela Crawford, the editor of the Midland Express in Victoria\u2019s Macedon ranges, said a cull had been discussed after a local woman <a href=\"http://www.bendigoadvertiser.com.au/story/3125054/speed-limit-under-review-after-string-of-crashes/?cs=3372\">suffered severe facial injuries</a> when a kangaroo flew through her windscreen in May. Local smash repairers had told Crawford that 95% of their business came from kangaroo impacts.</p> <p>\u201cMost drivers in these parts know this and slow down at those times but there are plenty of people who simply won\u2019t drive at those times because of the risk,\u201d she said. She said kangaroo-detecting Volvos may convince country folk to look beyond the ubiquitous Holden, Toyota and Ford.</p>",

The chain is to launch its new Christmas marketing campaign on social media on Friday at 9.30am, followed by a primetime TV airing at 7.15pm during ITV\u2019s Emmerdale. Its specialist in-store butchers, bakers, greengrocers and fishmongers \u2013 who, it claims, are all helping to deliver a \u201cmagical Christmas\u201d at Morrisons through its unusual \u201cfarm to fork\u201d supply chain \u2013 will feature in the advertisements. The campaign includes in-store, outdoor, radio, direct marketing, digital and press advertising as well as a series of three TV adverts. All the adverts will promote the hashtag #makeitmagical. Andy Atkinson, Morrisons marketing director, said: \u201cThe stars of our advert are our staff: they are the ones who deliver a magical Christmas through their passion for fresh food. This campaign also shows how we carefully source fresh produce, our friendly customer service and our great value for money.\u201d Last year, the Bradford-based grocer used TV personalities Ant and Dec \u2013 sporting \u00a312 Christmas sweaters - for what was described as a \u201cmake or break\u201d Christmas.

As retailers jostle to win the hearts, minds and cash of Christmas shoppers, new entrants to the media battle this year include electrical giant Currys PC World, which has launched its first dedicated Christmas brand advertising campaign. The five-part, \u00a310m offering features Hollywood A-lister Jeff Goldblum, who will offer acting tips to help the British public through awkward Christmas moments. Rolling out across TV, cinema, video, radio, print, social and online in the UK and Republic of Ireland, the adverts will appear during some high-profile primetime slots on Saturday 7 and Sunday 8 November, including during The X Factor and Downton Abbey. Also being launched on Friday are the hotly anticipated Christmas advertisements from John Lewis and Marks &amp; Spencer.

      "bodyText": "Asda is understood to be planning to scale back its plans for Black Friday later this month after the promotional frenzy in its stores last year failed to deliver profitable sales. In 2014, the retailer attracted negative publicity after camera crews invited to its Wembley store filmed shoppers fighting over discounted TVs. Queues of shoppers formed outside the doors and snapped up bargains on toys and electronics but many didn\u2019t stick around to buy groceries. As a result, sources said the Walmart-owned supermarket \u2013 which was one of the first British retailers to embrace the US-inspired discount day at the beginning of the Christmas season \u2013 was set on a very different approach this year. Trade journal Retail Week reported that Asda might consider online-only deals or spread offers over several days to prevent a chaotic rush of shoppers in its stores. By mid-afternoon last Black Friday, Asda said it had rung up 2m sales since 8am, making it the busiest single trading day of the year so far. It sold more than 8,000 TVs in the first hour, and more than 10,000 tablets in the first two hours. But one source said: \u201cLast year big-ticket items sold at a loss and attempts to ensure safety by forcing shoppers to queue for items meant food sales tanked.\u201d Another source said Asda wanted to find a less costly way to handle the day. Last year the business had to draft in 2,000 extra staff, including security guards, to help manage the sale. \u201cIt will be a totally different proposition this year,\u201d another source said. Asda and its fellow US-owned retailer Amazon have driven the rise of Black Friday, which has brought about a dramatic change in the way people do their Christmas shopping in the UK. The event, which falls on 27 November this year, has led to heavy discounting on electronic and electrical goods at a peak sales time when retailers traditionally raked in strong profits. Last year fashion retailers and department stores were drawn into the fray. Police were called to a number of Tesco stores amid late night disturbances as shoppers tried to snap up bargains, while the websites of several big retailers including Currys and Marks &amp; Spencer struggled to cope with demand. Consultancy Salmon has forecast that Black Friday 2015 will become the UK\u2019s first \u00a31bn online shopping day, but many retailers are unsure how shoppers will react to Black Friday this year. Last month Home Retail Group, the owner of Argos, warned that its profits might take a hit after it spent millions on advertising and brought in new vans to handle deliveries on the day but admitted it was unsure about the level of sales that might emerge. John Lewis boss Andy Street predicted Black Friday sales would be 20% higher this year than in 2014. But he has also warned fellow retailers to rein in Black Friday promotions after heavy demand over the promotional weekend caused havoc on the high street in the run-up to Christmas and hit profitability.",

      "bodyText": "Food-conscious Americans could save Whole Foods, says the company. All the upscale supermarket has to do is convince them that its food is really of a superior quality. The grocery chain is struggling as more markets are beginning to offer similar products at lower price points: Whole Foods was one of the first to target middle-class shoppers by offering them more expensive products that included organic and locally grown produce and items such as humane meats. After Whole Foods released its fourth quarter results on Wednesday, its stock dropped more than 6% in after-hours trading. The company insisted that its missed expectations \u2013 Wall Street expected the company\u2019s same-store sales to go up 0.7% but instead they fell 0.2% \u2013 are just a momentary setback. \u201cIn the face of increasing competition, we are not standing still,\u201d John Mackey, co-founder and co-chief executive officer of Whole Foods, said in a statement. \u201cThere has never been a time where customers have had more interest in what they eat, where it comes from and who\u2019s growing it \u2026 We see tremendous growth potential as food consciousness continues to evolve,\u201d said Walter Robb, co-CEO. He added that the company needs to move faster and \u201cbetter communicate our differentiation\u201d. But low sales could be attributed to more than just a competitive market and faulty messaging about quality. Whole Foods brand has suffered a few dings this year. The company came under fire for using foods made with prison labor. Peta sued, alleging that its humane meat standard is deceptive and misleading. In August, the company pulled its Asparagus water product after it was widely ridiculed on social media. And in June, the company was investigated for overcharging its New York customers. \u201cThe impact was really felt across the whole country, not [just] in New York City. This was national news,\u201d Glenda Flanagan, the company\u2019s chief financial officer, said on a conference call with analysts after the investigation was announced. Whole Food\u2019s woes, however, go beyond just brand management. At the end of September, the company announced it would cut about 1,500 jobs to keep prices low. On Wednesday, the company executives noted that the company was able to terminate jobs thanks to technological advancements. One of the examples used was the reduction of hours for administrative staff thanks to a new program that would help create schedules for customer service representatives. The company also hoped to cut about $300m in costs by the end of fiscal year of 2017. When the job cuts were first announced, the company expressed hope that those whose jobs would be lost could be placed into some of the open positions created in its new stores. Whole Foods currently has 433 stores in the US, UK and Canada. About 414 of those stores are in the US. The company is set on growth \u2013 adding more of the same stores in new areas as well as expanding into the lower price point market by opening smaller stores with cheaper products. These less-expensive stores \u2013 also known as 365 by Whole Foods Market \u2013 are designed to appeal to millennials and would compete with the likes of Trader Joe\u2019s. The company has yet to budge on its 1,200-store goal, which it has had for almost two years. Expanding into the lower priced market with its 365 stores, Whole Foods noted, could push its growth opportunity beyond 1,200 stores.",

      "bodyText": "George Osborne is being urged to stop the selloff of Royal Bank of Scotland shares at a loss before a parliamentary debate on the future of the bailed-out bank. Campaigners for banking reform argue that the public is opposed to the fire sale of the government stake in the bank, which fell for the first time in August when the chancellor sanctioned the sale of shares at a \u00a31bn loss to the taxpayer. The stake was reduced from 79% to 74% and the government has stated that its objective is to sell off its entire holding in RBS, which was rescued by \u00a345bn of taxpayer funds during the 2008 and 2009 crisis. The government\u2019s stake in RBS and the future of UK banking will be discussed in the Commons on Thursday, in a debate scheduled by the backbench business committee and proposed by Labour MP Kate Osamor. The campaigners \u2013 including from Move Your Money \u2013 want the state-owned bank to be directed to support rural communities and play its part in boosting the economy. They cite a petition calling for an end to the RBS sale which received 119,000 signatures. A spokesman for Move Your Money said: \u201cThe British public is overwhelmingly opposed to the reckless fire sale of RBS back to the people who caused the financial crisis. Public opinion cannot be clearer on this issue \u2013 we own RBS, so it should work for us.\u201d A survey by Populus in October found that just over half of respondents (53%) were aware that the government was selling off the stake in RBS. Of those with an opinion, the sale was opposed by three out of four people. An open letter has also been written to Osborne by campaigners for banking reform, including from the trade union Unite and economics professors, calling him to rethink his approach. \u201c[On Thursday], MPs will debate a motion to suspend the sale of RBS shares pending a full consideration of the other options, including turning it into a network of regional banks. \u201cWe fully support this motion and urge the government to undertake a proper, independent review of how the public stake in RBS should be dealt with to best support the government\u2019s stated objectives of getting the best value for the taxpayer and maximising support for the economy,\u201d the letter says. \u201cIn our view, the only way to make good our investment in RBS is to treat it as an opportunity to fix our broken banking system.\u201d",
