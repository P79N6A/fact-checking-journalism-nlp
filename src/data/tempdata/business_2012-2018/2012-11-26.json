    "webTitle": "Mark Carney: a Sven for Threadneedle Street?", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "It's a familiar story. Years, if not decades, of underachievement. A string of catastrophic performances. A lack of enthusiasm for any of the homegrown candidates. For George Osborne, grappling with the replacement of Sir Mervyn King as governor of the Bank of England, read the Football Association in 2000 deciding who should follow Kevin Keegan as manager of the England football team. Let's hear it for Mark Carney, the Treasury's Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson, named on Monday as the first non-Brit to run Threadneedle Street in its 318-year history. From the start of the process to recruit a new governor, Osborne identified Carney as the man for the job and refused to take no for an answer when the governor of the Bank of Canada rebuffed initial advances. The chancellor asked Carney to reconsider, believing that he was a better choice than any of the homegrown candidates. These include Paul Tucker, one of King's two deputies, and Lord Adair Turner, chairman of the Financial Services Authority. Tucker was as big a favourite with the bookies as Harry Redknapp was when Roy Hodgson got the nod from the FA earlier this year. No question, Carney is a brave and interesting choice. The assumption had been that Osborne, given all his other problems, would opt for the safe pair of hands and choose Tucker, the candidate the City would have chosen. Osborne wanted Carney for three reasons. Firstly, he has experience of running a big organisation, and this will be important now that the role of the Bank has been expanded to include oversight of the City. Under Labour, Threadneedle Street was really just a monetary policy organisation, where nine technocrats set interest rates in order to meet the government's inflation target. It is now also in charge of macro-prudential policy, which means ensuring that the commercial banks are no longer able to blow up the economy. Secondly, Carney comes from a country that has a good track record for both monetary policy and financial stability. Canada, like all other major industrial nations, went into recession in 2009, but its downturn was shallower than any G7 country and its recovery stronger than all bar Germany. Inflation in Canada is below target, a contrast with the UK where the annual increase in the cost of living has been above 2% for 69 of the past 78 months. What also impressed Osborne was that Canada's banks weathered the global storm in 2008-09. There were no failures and no expensive taxpayer bailouts, a contrast to the UK, the US and the eurozone. Carney is seen as the man who can push through changes to financial regulation deemed necessary to prevent a future crisis. Finally, Carney, 47, is seen as a prize catch. He was chosen by fellow central bankers to chair the Financial Stability Board, created by the G20 group of developed and developing nations after the crisis in an attempt to beef up global banking supervision and regulation. The Goldman Sachs alumnus is as highly regarded by his peers as Gordon Brown was by finance ministers in the 2000s, when the former chancellor was picked to chair the key policy committee at the International Monetary Fund. Although he doesn't take up his new job until 1 July next year, Carney will have a full in-tray. Britain's economy is still 3% smaller than it was when the recession began in 2008 and King warned earlier this month that output may fall again in the fourth quarter of this year. A further decline in GDP in the first three months of 2013 would constitute an unprecedented triple-dip recession, something few would rule out given the combination of weak consumer demand, a dysfunctional banking system and the ingrained problems of the eurozone. Unless something dramatic happens in the next seven months, Carney will inherit an emergency setting for monetary policy: interest rates of 0.5% and at least \u00a3375bn of quantitative easing. In Canada, Carney is seen as bit of a hawk, but it may be some time before he deems the UK economy strong enough to start returning monetary policy to normal. At the same time, he will also have to decide how to deal with a banking system much different in scale and complexity from its Canadian counterpart. Canada learned lessons from a banking crash in the early 1990s and in the run-up to the crisis of 2007-09 its banks were forced to hold more capital than those in the US, the UK or the eurozone, were less heavily leveraged and were less dependent on finance from the wholesale money markets. Osborne would like some of that conservative approach imported into the UK, while at the same time ensuring that the banks are not so hidebound by new capital requirements that credit is choked off. Managing Threadneedle Street will be no easy task. Carney has no hands-on experience of supervising banks, which in Canada is the job of a separate institution, the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions. Nor has the Bank of Canada undertaken any electronic money creation on his watch, for the simple reason that quantitative easing has not been needed to revive an economy that has benefited from strong global demand for its natural resources. Signs of a housing bubble are emerging in Canada, and there are those who say Carney is getting out just in time. The new governor arrives with an impressive-looking CV and may take the helm just at the moment when the economy finally starts to emerge from its torpor. But Britain is not Canada. It is a bigger economy, with a woeful recent track record. While the dreams are of past glories, the reality is slow growth and austerity stretching out for years to come. Carney should not be expected to remedy the deep-seated problems of the economy in five years, but if he fails to deliver results he will find that the unanimous approval with which his appointment was greeted on Monday will be rapidly followed by derision. Just ask Sven.",

They speculate that his 13 years at Goldman Sachs, which took him to London, Tokyo, New York and Toronto, inspired his smart dress sense and air of authority. Yet he is not brash, preferring to make few public comments and he rarely agrees to interviews....</p> <p>But he made the headlines in the financial press last year when he came under attack from JP Morgan boss Jamie Dimon during a meeting of then G20 Financial Stability Board, set up to tame the banks in the aftermath of the financial crisis.</p> </blockquote> <p>Meanwhile <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/annpettifor\">Ann Pettifor </a>isn't jumping on the Carney bandwagon either, arguing that his appointment means <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/nov/26/mark-carney-appointment-bank-england?intcmp=239\">\"more of the same\"</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There is nothing in his speeches that indicates that he will help give Britain's real economy the protection it needs from its over-mighty \u2013 and still very dangerous \u2013 banking sector. Nothing, in other words, that indicates the real economy \u2013 the productive sector \u2013 will be given priority over the City's preference for reckless global speculation.</p> <p>Instead like many others who adopt a \"market-based\" approach to regulation, Carney prefers to tinker \u2013 retrospectively \u2013 with the capital ratios of banks.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-50b3d2c2b579b99501eaa914\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-11-26T20:36:19.166Z\">8.36pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Video: George Osborne explaining his choice</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here's a video clip of the moment when George Osborne dropped the bombshell that Mark Carney had been appointed.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/video/2012/nov/26/george-osborne-mark-carney-governor-bank-england-video\"                                data-show-ads=\"true\"                        data-video-name=\"George Osborne announces Mark Carney as new governor of Bank of England - video\"                        > <object width=\"460\" height=\"307\"><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"></param><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/video/embed\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><param name=\"flashvars\" value=\"endpoint=http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/video/2012/nov/26/george-osborne-mark-carney-governor-bank-england-video/json\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/video/embed\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"460\" height=\"307\" flashvars=\"endpoint=http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/video/2012/nov/26/george-osborne-mark-carney-governor-bank-england-video/json\" wmode=\"opaque\"></embed></object> </figure>  </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-50b3d20db579b99501eaa913\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-11-26T20:33:17.373Z\">8.33pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Ed</strong> <strong>Conway</strong>, economics editor of Sky News, has written an account of how George Osborne got his man:</p> <p>Here's a flavour:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Osborne had been chasing Carney since early this year, when he first floated the idea with the Canadian at a G20 summit in Mexico. He had asked him officially in August. Carney said no. He still had 18 months left in the job. He didn't want to do the eight year term Osborne was stipulating. And that was before one even considered the notion of becoming the first non-UK Governor in the Bank of England's 318 year history.</p> <p>So until last month he was dismissed from the running. Then Osborne made another approach. This time around, he sold the prospect more aggressively. Plus he said that if Carney insisted, he would reduce the term to five years \u2013 after all the main principle was to have a single term rather opening up the messy question of reappointment \u2013 as had happened after Sir Mervyn's first term.</p> <p>This time around, Carney didn't say no. Outlandish as the prospect of the appointment was, he was interested. The weekend before last he made a surreptitious visit to London, and on the Sunday he was interviewed by the Treasury/Bank of England panel \u2013 and by Osborne himself.</p> </blockquote> <p>And the rest was history -- or in this case a real surprise (<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/nov/26/new-bank-of-england-governor-named#block-50b38b9b95cbefa34ce3c946\">see 3.32pm onwards</a>).</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-50b3d02995cb3640bc6e4771\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-11-26T20:25:14.119Z\">8.25pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/sunny_hundal\" data-user-id=\"22021978\"> <strong>Sunny Hundal, </strong></a>editor of Liberal Conspiracy (among other roles), provides a welcome break from the consensus that Mark Carney is a wonderful hire.</p> <p>He tweets:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/sunny_hundal/status/273139402161672192\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>I'll be the first one to dissent on Carney: recruiting Goldman Sachs alumni neither a bold move nor good for where economy needs to go.</p>&mdash; Sunny Hundal (@sunny_hundal) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sunny_hundal/status/273139402161672192\" data-datetime=\"2012-11-26T19:01:22+00:00\">November 26, 2012</a></blockquote> </figure>  <p>Carney isn't the only central banker with a stint at Goldman Sachs on the CV either -- Mario Draghi, head of the European Central, also spent several years there.</p> <p>And Draghi, of course, was Carney's <del>successor</del> <strong>predecessor</strong> as head of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Stability_Board\">Financial Stability Board</a>. <em>Small world...</em></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-11-26T20:34:11.578Z\">at 8.34pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-50b3cc12b579b99501eaa90d\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-11-26T20:09:45.771Z\">8.09pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">From paperboy to the Bank of England</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>There's particular pride at the <strong>Edmonton Journal</strong> in Alberta today, following the news that their former paperboy has been named the next Bank of England governor.</p> <p>They report that Governor Carney still keeps in touch with his boyhood town, where he once delivered copies of the Journal.</p> <p>Interviewed in 2009 when he paid a visit to Edmonton, Carney told the paper:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I\u2019m an Oilers fan.

      "bodyText": "We'll be talking about the surprise choice of Mark Carney as the next governor of the Bank of England for months, probably until he takes over next summer. But the initial shock of his appointment has subsided, so I'm going to stop the live blog now. \u2022 Our coverage of the announcement starts at 3.31pm GMT, when chancellor George Osborne started speaking, and runs up to the end of the post-statement questions at 4.14pm \u2022 There's instant analysis at 3.47pm. \u2022 And our comprehensive round-up of reaction starts at 4.21pm, including David Cameron's comments at 5.34pm, Alistair Darling at 7.13pm, and the view from Canada at 5.07pm and 6.06pm. \u2022 Plus video of Osborne's announcement (here) and Carney appearing to rule himself out this summer (here). Thanks for reading, and all the comments. Let's do it again in five years when Carney's successor is announced. Andy Haldane is the smart choice -- but after today's surprise, you never know... Goodnight! Here's our profile of Mark Carney by economics correspondent Phillip Inman, who writes: Critics say he wears his Oxford doctorate on his sleeve and is less than self-effacing. They speculate that his 13 years at Goldman Sachs, which took him to London, Tokyo, New York and Toronto, inspired his smart dress sense and air of authority. Yet he is not brash, preferring to make few public comments and he rarely agrees to interviews.... But he made the headlines in the financial press last year when he came under attack from JP Morgan boss Jamie Dimon during a meeting of then G20 Financial Stability Board, set up to tame the banks in the aftermath of the financial crisis. Meanwhile Ann Pettifor isn't jumping on the Carney bandwagon either, arguing that his appointment means \"more of the same\": There is nothing in his speeches that indicates that he will help give Britain's real economy the protection it needs from its over-mighty \u2013 and still very dangerous \u2013 banking sector. Nothing, in other words, that indicates the real economy \u2013 the productive sector \u2013 will be given priority over the City's preference for reckless global speculation. Instead like many others who adopt a \"market-based\" approach to regulation, Carney prefers to tinker \u2013 retrospectively \u2013 with the capital ratios of banks. Here's a video clip of the moment when George Osborne dropped the bombshell that Mark Carney had been appointed. Ed Conway, economics editor of Sky News, has written an account of how George Osborne got his man: Here's a flavour: Osborne had been chasing Carney since early this year, when he first floated the idea with the Canadian at a G20 summit in Mexico. He had asked him officially in August. Carney said no. He still had 18 months left in the job. He didn't want to do the eight year term Osborne was stipulating. And that was before one even considered the notion of becoming the first non-UK Governor in the Bank of England's 318 year history. So until last month he was dismissed from the running. Then Osborne made another approach. This time around, he sold the prospect more aggressively. Plus he said that if Carney insisted, he would reduce the term to five years \u2013 after all the main principle was to have a single term rather opening up the messy question of reappointment \u2013 as had happened after Sir Mervyn's first term. This time around, Carney didn't say no. Outlandish as the prospect of the appointment was, he was interested. The weekend before last he made a surreptitious visit to London, and on the Sunday he was interviewed by the Treasury/Bank of England panel \u2013 and by Osborne himself. And the rest was history -- or in this case a real surprise (see 3.32pm onwards). Sunny Hundal, editor of Liberal Conspiracy (among other roles), provides a welcome break from the consensus that Mark Carney is a wonderful hire. He tweets: Carney isn't the only central banker with a stint at Goldman Sachs on the CV either -- Mario Draghi, head of the European Central, also spent several years there. And Draghi, of course, was Carney's successor predecessor as head of the Financial Stability Board. Small world... There's particular pride at the Edmonton Journal in Alberta today, following the news that their former paperboy has been named the next Bank of England governor. They report that Governor Carney still keeps in touch with his boyhood town, where he once delivered copies of the Journal. Interviewed in 2009 when he paid a visit to Edmonton, Carney told the paper: I\u2019m an Oilers fan. I\u2019ve followed the Oilers ever since I left. I mean, I obviously grew up in the salad days of Gretzky, Messier and Paul Coffey and I\u2019ve followed them through thick and thin. I\u2019m pulling for MacT and the boys to pull it out yet again and get into the playoffs. Ice-hockey, eh? More here: Mark Carney: From Edmonton Journal paperboy to Bank of England Ben Fenton of the Financial Times has put together a list of 10 interesting facts about Mark Carney. I've pinched a few: \u2022 His home town of Fort Smith, in the Northwest Territories, is on the banks of the Slave river and has a population of 2,500. The temperature there on Monday afternoon was -21C. He lived there till he was six years old, when the family moved to Edmonton. \u2022 Mr Carney attended Harvard University, where he was the reserve goalkeeper of the ice hockey team. \u2022 His wife, Diana, whom he met at Oxford, has joint Canadian-British citizenship as do their four daughters. Alistair Darling, the former chancellor of the exchequer, has added his voice to the chorus of people hailing the arrival of Mark Carney: Speaking on Channel 4 News a moment ago, Darling said: I worked very closely with Mark Carney during the financial crisis... He stuck out from other central bankers in his understanding of the crisis and what needs to be done about it We had to get the best candidate...this is a very good appointment. David Blanchflower, the economist and former member of the Bank of England monetary policy committee, agrees: You hire the best person with the best CV, and Carney's that person. Paul Tucker has taken his surprise failure to become Bank of England governor with good grace, reports the Wall Street Journal's David Enrich: This video clip from August shows a BBC interview with Mark Carney in August. Scroll forward to 19.45 to see Carney asked whether he is interested in the Bank of England job. He grins, and replies I'm interested in who they pick.... No... It's an extremely important post. I'm very focused on my post at the Bank of Canada... and I look forwards to working with the next governor of the Bank of England... Pressed on whether this is \"a no or a never, Carney said: It's both. Or neither, it transpires. Back in the UK, Liberal Democrat president Tim Farron has warmly welcomed Carney's appointment: Farron told me over Twitter: He is a great choice though. He is is widely regarded as the best central bank governor in the world. Big coup for the government.. He has a hard job ahead, but he's very qualified and experienced. (if you're new to UK politics, the Lib Dems are junior partners in the UK coalition government, but probably didn't have any influence on the process). Of course, it shouldn't be a surprise that everyone is being nice about Carney now he's got the job \u2013 but the scale of the welcome is a little surprising. Three hours after the announcement, I've not found many Brits who aren't pleased with the choice - or many Canadian who are happy that Carney is leaving mid-term. Canadian's are taking the loss of Mark Carney stoically. Up to a point, anyway. Jonathan Rose, professor at the Department of Political Studies at Queen's University at Kingston, Ontario, argued that Carney is taking a backward step: And the comments in this story on CBC confirm that Carney was well respected. One reader said: Canada is losing a super star who could see across political lines for the good of Canada. I'm very sorry to see him go because of his integrity and leadership in the financial world. Another concurred: I must say congratulations to Mr. Carney. I am sure that he will do fantastic in his new role. It is sad to see him leave, but love him or hate him, he has done an amazing job. Onwards and Upwards I'm not sure many UK policymakers would get such a warm farewell -- although you can prove me wrong when Sir Mervyn King retires next summer. David Cameron says he's delighted that Mark Carney has accepted the chance to take the controls at Threadneedle Street: The PM said: I am delighted that Mark Carney has accepted the job as the next Governor of the Bank of England. \u201cHe takes up the role at an important time, as we put the Bank of England back at the heart of financial regulation, so that we do not repeat the mistakes of the past. \u201cHis distinguished record on economic policy, the high regard of his international peers and the leadership he has shown on the global economic crisis make him the exceptional person for this job. I very much look forward to working with him from next summer. The BBC's business editor, Robert Peston, is beating himself up for not realising that Mark Carney was in the running for the Bank of England top job. Back on 12 November, Peston declared that Tucker, Sir John Vickers, Adair Turner and Terry Burns were on the shortlist along with a mystery fifth candidate (later reported to be Sharon Bowles MEP). But as George Osborne intoned the words \"Mark Carney\" at 3.32pm, Peston's heart sank, as these tweets show: Don't worry, Robert -- you'll always have Northern Rock. The CBI has now welcomed the news that Mark Carney is the next Governor of the Bank of England. Katja Hall, CBI chief policy director, said: His strong track record as the Canadian central bank Governor and extensive experience in international financial regulation mean that he is well positioned to guide Britain through challenging economic times. We look forward to working with and supporting him in his new role. One central bank's gain is another's loss, and over in Canada finance minister Jim Flaherty had to break the news that the country will soon be short of a central bank governor. Flaherty told reporters that it was a \"bittersweet,\" moment and that Carney's advice had \"kept Canada strong,\" Flaherty added that Canada has the best record for fiscal stability in the G7 - a point which George Osborne made to parliament when he explained why Carney was the best man to take over the Bank of England. That's via CBC News, which adds: Carney said he and Flaherty had enjoyed an effective partnership and added he will miss the camaraderie and clear sense of purpose he experienced with the finance minister. He praised the strength of the central bank and reiterated his confidence in it. The really curious thing about Mark Carney's appointment is that the Bank of Canada governor had ruled himself out of the job during the summer. The story begins in April, when the FT ran a front-page story declaring: Mark Carney, the governor of Canada\u2019s central bank, has been informally approached as a potential candidate to replace Sir Mervyn King as head of the Bank of England in June next year. The story was played down by both sides. and then in August Carney indicated that he wasn't a runner. It now appears, though that George Osborne had been casting covetous glances - and more - across the Atlantic for some time: ITV's Laura Kuenssberg has been working the Westminster grapevine, and reports: Carney's appointment has not caused any ructions in the financial markets. Amusingly, the pound did hit a two and a half-week high against the Canadian dollar on the news. The decision to appoint a Canadian to run the Bank of England concerns some readers, but others are impressed by George Osborne's choice: Exodus20: Why not British? To whom does he owe his allegiance in his heart? Then again, many who sold us off, financially, economically and politically are suppose to be British. cynic9 Mark Carney is a good choice. However, it is a sad indictment of the UK economics and finance professions that it could not conjure a suitable candidate. Very sad... Self Wow - it's Carney! That is amazing - a sensible, competent person from a sensible, competent country. I need to lie down. Great news. Sir Mervyn King has endorsed the decision to appoint Mark Carney. In a statement, the outgoing governor said: He represents a new generation of leadership for the Bank of England, and is an outstanding choice to succeed me. Since Mark became Governor of the Bank of Canada, I have worked closely with him and admired his contributions to the world of central banking, in which he is widely respected. TUC General Secretary Brendan Barber reckons that Mark Carney has an almost impossible task, given the state of the UK economy. Barber said: The Chancellor seems to have outsourced the job of getting the economy moving to the Bank of England but the Bank is now running out of monetary ammunition. Interest rates are about as low as they can get, and quantitative easing, while welcome as far as it goes, is not doing much to boost the real economy. And while the Bank has an important new role in regulating banking, the government wants to water down the Vickers recommendations and does not have the determination to give us a finance sector that works for the rest of the economy. This is probably a first for Mark Carney - he's trending on Twitter. So is the Bank of England. Here's some of the instant reaction to the appointment, including a supportive couple of tweets from Standard Chartered's chief economists And that's the end of the questioning, after a dramatic 40 minutes. David Cameron is now discussing last week's European Union summit, which ended without a deal on the EU budget \u2013 my colleague Andrew Sparrow is covering it in Politics Live. I'll keep tracking the reaction to Mark Carney's appointment here (Monetary Policy Live, perhaps) David Ruffley, Conservative MP (and another member of the Treasury committee that gave Paul Tucker such a grilling in the summer), asks Osborne whether her wants Tucker to remain at the Bank. Osborne replies that he does: I think Tucker has been an excellent deputy governor, and I hope he stays on. Labour Barry Sheerman comes closest to denting the sense of jubilation in the House of Commons, saying it's a shame that we couldn't find a British candidate. Osborne replies that it's a sign of Britain's confidence that we can go and get the best person for the job, across the globe. Makes Carney sound like a monetary Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson. Now Andrea Leadsom, the Conservative MP who shone on the Treasury committee during the Libor investigation, says she wants to jump up and down for joy. Another endorsement for Carney. The Speaker, John Bercow, tells her that her father (one her constituents) wouldn't approve. Even Dennis Skinner, veteran Labour MP, is prepared to give Osborne's choice his blessing - almost. Skinner tells parliament: All I can say is this Mr Carney and Mr Bean had better be good! Osborne tells the MP for Bolsover not to panic: I can assure the honourable member that Dr Carney and Dr Bean are excellent. George Osborne insists that there's no reason to fret about appointing a Canadian. Canada is a G7 country. It's one of our allies...it's hard to think of a closer ally than Canada. Osborne adds that Canada had a rather better crisis than the UK. Conservative MP John Redwood welcomes the choice of Mark Carney, saying the Canadian should bring \"new thinking to troubled banking and monetary policy in Britain\". MPs are continuing to debate the shock choice - with one telling Osborne that this is \"a rare chance for all sides of parliament to support one of his decisions\". Osborne wryly replies that it's a shame he can't bottle the atmosphere in the House. Larry Elliott, our economics editor, says the decision is a big, big shock: He tells me: George Osborne always wanted Mark Carney, and the stories linking him with the job originated from the Treasury, but he was thought to have ruled himself out. The City fully expected the chancellor to pick Paul Tucker, the current deputy governor, and this will be a big blow to him and Adair Turner, the chairman of the Financial Services Authority. As governor of the Bank of Canada, Carney is thought to have had a \u201cgood crisis\u201d. Canadian banks weathered the storm better than most, seen in part due to the regulation of the Bank of Canada. What now for Paul Tucker, the insider who had been groomed to replace Sir Mervyn King? Ed Conway, Sky's economics editor, reckons that Tucker's position as deputy governor for financial stability is \"rather invidious\". Intriguingly, George Osborne told the House that Charlie Bean - the other deputy governor, has agreed to serve another year at the Bank to help Carney bed in. Tucker was not mentioned. Ed Balls, the shadow chancellor, is now speaking -- and welcoming the decision to appoint Carney. This is a good choice, and his experience will be invaluable. Balls adds, though, that the job is \"near impossible\" for one person. George Osborne ends his statement by explaining how important the governorship is: It is charged with keeping prices under control. It sets interest rates...and under this government's reforms it places a crucial role in keeping the UK economy safe. Osborne adds that Mark Carney is the outstanding, preeminent central bank of his generation, and the right man to take control of the Bank. Carney will also seek UK citizenship, Osborne adds. Osborne reveals that Mark Carney will serve for five years (not the eight years that were advertised), and is keen to appear before the Treasury Committee of the Houses of Parliament to discuss UK monetary policy. George Osborne explains that Mark Carney will bring 'fresh perspective' to the Bank of England, and help UK businesses and families through the tricky economic times ahead. Carney, Osborne says, will provide the \"strong leadership the bank needs as it takes on the role of handling financial supervision\" in the UK. It's Mark Carney, the head of the Bank of Canada. That is a real shock. Osborne says he has met all five of the shortlisted candidates -- and concluded that each one would have made a good governor. George Osborne has begun announcing the decision in parliament - saying Mervyn King has served the UK well at this very difficult time At one stage, Paul Tucker has looked like the natural successor to Sir Mervyn King - but that all changed this summer when the Libor rate-fixing scandal hit the City. Emails showed that Tucker was in contact with senior officials at Barclays at the height of the financial panic in autumn 2008. Some of the messages appeared to show that he had put pressure on the bank to submit lower figures for its borrowing costs - a charge Tucker insisted was false. But he faced a torrid time before the Treasury Committee - putting his chances of succeeding King at risk. Bill Keegan, the Observer's distinguished senior economics commentator, wrote yesterday about how Sir Mervyn King's time at the Bank can be neatly divided into two distinct periods: a happy one and a not so happy one. After the early glory days, both as deputy governor and later in the hotter seat, King basked in the reflected acclaim for what was considered, for a time, to be one of Gordon Brown's greatest historic contributions to the British polity: the granting of operational independence in monetary policy to the Bank of England \u2013 that is, the power to determine the official short-term rate of interest. In its early days, the monetary policy committee, which the governor chairs, was widely considered a huge success, and it was King who coined the acronym \"Nice\" (standing for non-inflationary continuous expansion) and applied it to that pre-crisis \"nice decade\". Then it all went wrong -- prompting interest rates to be slashed to record lows, hundreds of billions of pounds of electronic money to be created through quantitative easing, and month after month of above-target inflation. History's verdict on King is yet to be written -- but there's no doubt he is leaving his successor a remarkable legacy. The chatter in the corridors of power (political and monetary) is that Paul Tucker is home and hosed as the next governor. Amusingly, Chris Giles of the FT reports that he telephoned Threadneedle Street to inquire about the appointment, and was put through to Tucker's office! This is also the first time that the Financial Times has publicly endorsed a potential governor -- throwing its pink-papered weight behind Paul Tucker. Calling him The right man for the Old Lady (which sounds like an advert from a dodgier rival to Soulmates), the FT declared that Tucker was the best of the bunch. There is no perfect candidate on the shortlist. Sharon Bowles, the high-profile Liberal Democrat Euro-MP, has engaged vigorously with policy. Sir John Vickers is a distinguished economist whose inquiry has shaped important banking reforms. Lord Turner is a versatile public servant with a cutting-edged intellect. But none of the above possesses the all-round experience of Mr Tucker. As a BoE lifer he has overseen all the key areas the next governor would have to deal with: monetary policy, prudential supervision, macro-prudential regulation and international markets. The next governor will be appointed by the Queen, on the recommendation of the chancellor and the prime minister. That's the usual routine, and almost the only normal thing about this process. For the first time, the position was advertised, leading to a five-person shortlist being drawn up and interviewed. The advert called for a candidate who could: successfully lead, influence and manage the change in the Bank\u2019s responsibilities, inspiring confidence and credibility both within the Bank and throughout financial markets. adding: The successful candidate will have experience of working in, or with, a central bank or similar institution; or will have worked at the most senior level in a major bank or other financial institution. He or she will demonstrate strong leadership, management and policy skills; will have an advanced understanding of financial markets and good economic knowledge. He or she will be a strong communicator, have good interpersonal skills and will be a person of undisputed integrity and standing. Good afternoon. After months of speculation, the identity of the next governor of the Bank of England is about to be revealed. Chancellor George Osborne will tell MPs shortly after 3.30pm who has been chosen to lead Britain's central bank, at one of the more turbulent and tense times in its 318 year history. The favourite candidate to succeed Sir Mervyn King is deputy governor Paul Tucker, currently responsible for financial stability. But there are four other candidates on the shortlist -- Lord Turner, chairman of the Financial Services Authority; Lord Burns, chairman of Santander UK; Sir John Vickers, chairman of the Independent Commission on Banking (and Warden of All Soul's College) and Sharon Bowles, (Liberal Democrat MEP). The successful candidate will take on one of the most important roles in the UK economy -- charged with delivering low inflation (monetary stability) and also ensuring the health of the UK financial system (financial stability).",

Qatar still holds 6.7% of Barclays, but has made a profit of around \u00a31.7bn from selling warrants in 2009 and now. As part of the deal, Deutsche Bank and Goldman Sachs sold 303m Barclays shares at 244p each, putting pressure on the bank's market price.</p> <p>Separately came reports that Barclays' investors were putting pressure on new chief executive Antony Jenkins to cut back its investment banking business. Meanwhile analysts at JP Morgan Cazenove raised their recommendation on Barclays from neutral to overweight:</p> <blockquote> We believe that a credible new strategy requires balance sheet reduction in investment banking over time, alongside further cost cuts group-wide. While this may imply lower revenue near term, we believe that both shareholders and regulators are likely to be in favor of a reduction of investment banking assets to drive higher group return on equity and lower cost of equity. Barclays has remained our preferred UK domestic bank this year, but despite the recent rally, the shares still trade at discount of around 25% to the broader sector. With capital being addressed, we believe that Barclays offers the best relative risk/reward within UK banks with an upside of around 50% in a full restructuring scenario. </blockquote> <p>Elsewhere <strong>Royal Bank of Scotland</strong> fell 8.9p to 285.1p on concerns about possible libor-related fines, while <strong>Lloyds Banking Group</strong> lost 1.305p to 45.1p.</p> <p>Overall the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> fell 32.42 points to 5786.72 as the eurogroup met on Greece once more and Germany issued some disappointing confidence figures.</p> <p>Defensive stocks were in favour, with <strong>British American Tobacco</strong> adding 28p to \u00a332.52 and <strong>Imperial Tobacco</strong> rising 11p to \u00a324.95p. <strong>British Land</strong> continued its recent gains after a positive trading update, climbing 2p to 537p as UBS raised its recommendation from neutral to buy.</p> <p>Among the mid-caps <strong>Centamin </strong>was undermined by funding worries after it said it needed to make a gold shipment from Egypt shortly to meeting its working capital needs.</p> <p>A growing political crisis in the country has also unsettled investors in the mining group. Centamin said it was preparing to resume exports, which had been halted after a court judgement questioning its right to operate its only mine, at Sukari.</p> <p>It is now lodging an appeal against the ruling, and so has decided to resume exports. Operations at Sukari had continued since the judgement. Centamin dropped 4.1p to 60.6p.</p> <p>Centamin is the second biggest faller in the FTSE 250 behind translation software group <strong>SDL</strong>, down 72.5p at 438.5p. The company warned full year profits could fall short of City expectations by as much as \u00a34m. Analysts had been looking for around \u00a340m profit this year.</p> <p><strong>Betfair</strong> added 7.5p to 760p despite saying it would withdraw from the Greek market until there was greater clarity on regulation. It had been expecting to make \u00a313m of revenue and \u00a37m of profit from the country in this financial year.</p> <p>Betfair said it had not applied for a permit to operate in Greece since the value of the permit was unclear and the gambling legislation in the country was, it believed, inconsistent with European law. It added:</p> <blockquote> Furthermore the associated fiscal conditions attached to these permits, which may include the payment of taxes on historical revenues, make the market economically unattractive. </blockquote> <p>Earlier this month, Greece announced financial penalties and criminal sanctions against gaming companies that operated without a permit. Betfair said it believed there were significant issues with the legality of this move, but has decided to withdraw anyway.</p> <p>Pork processor <strong>Cranswick</strong> climbed 73.5p to 812.5p after it reported a 21% rise in half year profits and said it had passed on higher pig prices to its customers. Last month the company warned pig prices were at a three year high.</p> <p>Panmure Gordon analyst Damian McNeela said:</p> <blockquote> The fact that Cranswick has successfully managed to secure price increases from the retailers underpinning our 2013 forecasts should be well received, and allows us to overlook the slight miss to our first half forecasts. Cranswick reported adjusted pretax profit growth of 21% to \u00a322.5m versus our \u00a323.4m. Looking further ahead though, there remains uncertainty about EU-wide pork prices following the planned introduction of the EU sow stall ban on 1 January 2013. As such we believe the current valuation looks fair and we maintain our hold recommendation and 800p price target. </blockquote>",

Barclays has remained our preferred UK domestic bank this year, but despite the recent rally, the shares still trade at discount of around 25% to the broader sector. With capital being addressed, we believe that Barclays offers the best relative risk/reward within UK banks with an upside of around 50% in a full restructuring scenario. Elsewhere Royal Bank of Scotland fell 8.9p to 285.1p on concerns about possible libor-related fines, while Lloyds Banking Group lost 1.305p to 45.1p. Overall the FTSE 100 fell 32.42 points to 5786.72 as the eurogroup met on Greece once more and Germany issued some disappointing confidence figures. Defensive stocks were in favour, with British American Tobacco adding 28p to \u00a332.52 and Imperial Tobacco rising 11p to \u00a324.95p. British Land continued its recent gains after a positive trading update, climbing 2p to 537p as UBS raised its recommendation from neutral to buy. Among the mid-caps Centamin was undermined by funding worries after it said it needed to make a gold shipment from Egypt shortly to meeting its working capital needs. A growing political crisis in the country has also unsettled investors in the mining group. Centamin said it was preparing to resume exports, which had been halted after a court judgement questioning its right to operate its only mine, at Sukari. It is now lodging an appeal against the ruling, and so has decided to resume exports. Operations at Sukari had continued since the judgement. Centamin dropped 4.1p to 60.6p. Centamin is the second biggest faller in the FTSE 250 behind translation software group SDL, down 72.5p at 438.5p. The company warned full year profits could fall short of City expectations by as much as \u00a34m. Analysts had been looking for around \u00a340m profit this year. Betfair added 7.5p to 760p despite saying it would withdraw from the Greek market until there was greater clarity on regulation. It had been expecting to make \u00a313m of revenue and \u00a37m of profit from the country in this financial year. Betfair said it had not applied for a permit to operate in Greece since the value of the permit was unclear and the gambling legislation in the country was, it believed, inconsistent with European law. It added: Furthermore the associated fiscal conditions attached to these permits, which may include the payment of taxes on historical revenues, make the market economically unattractive. Earlier this month, Greece announced financial penalties and criminal sanctions against gaming companies that operated without a permit. Betfair said it believed there were significant issues with the legality of this move, but has decided to withdraw anyway. Pork processor Cranswick climbed 73.5p to 812.5p after it reported a 21% rise in half year profits and said it had passed on higher pig prices to its customers. Last month the company warned pig prices were at a three year high. Panmure Gordon analyst Damian McNeela said: The fact that Cranswick has successfully managed to secure price increases from the retailers underpinning our 2013 forecasts should be well received, and allows us to overlook the slight miss to our first half forecasts. Cranswick reported adjusted pretax profit growth of 21% to \u00a322.5m versus our \u00a323.4m. Looking further ahead though, there remains uncertainty about EU-wide pork prices following the planned introduction of the EU sow stall ban on 1 January 2013. As such we believe the current valuation looks fair and we maintain our hold recommendation and 800p price target.",

The move, which will not affect Qatar's status as the bank's biggest shareholder, will see the fund convert its remaining holding of 379m units of Barclays' warrants into shares. Deutsche Bank and Goldman Sachs will then offer the stake - some 303m shares worth around \u00a3750m - to institutional shareholders at a discount of 4% to the market price. The relationship between Barclays and Qatar followed a fundraising in 2008, which allowed the bank to avoid receiving funds from the UK government. As part of the deal Qatar received a number of warrants, selling some \u00a31.4m of them a year later. It is now disposing of the rest, but will still hold a 6.65% stake in the bank. Payments made by Barclays to Qatar as part of the fundraising are being looked at by the Serious Fraud Office and the Financial Services Authority. Separately, weekend reports suggested Barclays was coming under pressure to cut back on its investment banking activities. Barclays is currently the biggest faller on the FTSE 100, hit by the prospect of a flood of shares hitting the market. It is down 10.3p at 243.9p, a 4% decline mirroring the discount on the proposed sale price of the stake. Gary Greenwood at Shore Capital said: We are concerned about the lack of visibility in respect of future investment banking returns given the uncertain regulatory environment and believe a reallocation of capital away from this area of the business could be beneficial for Barclays' future share price performance. Management will provide an update on strategy alongside its full year results on 12 February 2013. Barclays shares currently trade on a...PE of 6.3 times and a dividend yield of 3.7%, which we continue to view as being relatively undemanding multiples despite a recent rally in the shares. However, Shore Capital retains a hold recommendation on Barclays' shares given the still uncertain outlook for the investment bank. Other banks were also under pressure, with Royal Bank of Scotland down 7.5p at 286.5p on worries about libor-related fines, and Lloyds Banking Group 0.835p lower at 45.57p.
