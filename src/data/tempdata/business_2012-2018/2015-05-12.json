      "bodyText": "Congratulations to the Treasury and its sidekicks at UK Financial Investments: the little-and-often \u201ctrading plan\u201d they devised last year for offloading Lloyds Banking Group shares is working splendidly. The drip-feed of stock has not interrupted the smooth upwards progress of the Lloyds share price. After the latest sale, the state\u2019s stake has been cut from 24.9% to 19.9% in three months with minimum fuss. At the current pace, the state could be out of Lloyds altogether by this time next year. Who would wish to interfere with this winning formula? Well, George Osborne, the man whose officials designed it, would. During the election campaign, he pledged to shed Lloyds shares in flashier fashion via a retail offer to private investors. This will include a one-for-10 \u201cloyalty bonus\u201d for those who keep their shares for a year. The thin justification was to \u201cencourage a culture of long-term share ownership\u201d. The flipside of a loyalty bonus, though, is lower proceeds for the Treasury. We\u2019re not talking zillions, since there will be a \u00a3200 cap per head. But if, say, \u00a32bn-worth of shares attract the bonus, that\u2019s a \u00a3200m giveaway. There is no need for it. A government preaching fiscal discipline should not be letting \u00a3200m slip between the cracks. Stick to the trading plan, which is quietly finding buyers for Lloyds shares at the best price for the public purse. EasyJet\u2019s sudden dive The toilets will not get smaller on easyJet\u2019s reconfigured Airbus A320s, we are assured. Thank goodness. But the share price did shrink on Tuesday \u2013 by almost a 10th. That\u2019s a very strong reaction to the mildest of warnings about the outlook for the second half of the financial year. Revenue per seat will be down around four percentage points for the third quarter. It\u2019s not much \u2013 and most of the effect can be explained by the timing of Easter and the April strikes of air traffic controllers in France. So why the violent share price reaction? Put it down to the mistaken belief that airlines always get an easy leg-up from lower fuel prices. Life is rarely so straightforward. Lower fuel costs mean lower ticket prices and thus more demand from passengers. But marginally profitable airlines also find it easier to stay in business and provide competition. So profit margins are not necessarily boosted. Last year, easyJet\u2019s margins were a very healthy 12.8%, having doubled since 2010. So maybe the company is approaching the point at which further advances are trickier to achieve. That\u2019s hardly a long-term problem, though, if margins can stay around the 13% mark and there is demand for more flights. EasyJet will still make profits of \u00a3635m this year, up from \u00a3581m, and returns on capital remain excellent. At about 12 times earnings, there is no reason for shareholders to panic. Greece on the brink? Is Greece really down to its last \u20ac600m? Could the country go bust in the next couple of weeks, as finance minister Yanis Varoufakis suggests? It\u2019s impossible to know. Sifting information from misinformation is a mug\u2019s game when both sides in a negotiation are engaged in brinkmanship. But, if the numbers are accurate, eurozone lenders may soon be asked to send a partial advance to Athens. As a gesture of goodwill, and an expression of confidence in a successful outcome, would they hand over a couple of billion euros from the \u20ac7.2bn (\u00a35.2bn) that is at issue? If the alternative is Greece\u2019s accidental slide out of the euro, surely the answer would be yes. Would such a concession strengthen the Greeks\u2019 negotiating hand? Possibly. Political responsibility Robert Jenkins, former member of the Bank of England\u2019s financial policy committee, makes a good point in a letter to the FT: politicians are better at resigning than the bosses of big banks. The leaders of the Labour and Liberal Democratic parties have gone, taking responsibility for their parties\u2019 policy shortcomings. By contrast, those who served on the boards of banks during periods of \u201cmarket manipulation, failed acquisitions, rampant money-laundering and tax-related wrongdoing\u201d tend to acknowledge responsibility but rarely offer their resignation. Jenkins\u2019s moral: only the politicians understand that responsibility and accountability go hand in hand.",

Here\u2019s your guide through the maze \u2013 what we can see of it anyway.</p> <p><strong>What was supposed to happen on Tuesday?</strong></p> <p>The Senate was scheduled to vote on Trade Promotion Authority (TPA). The bill, which needed at least 60 votes to advance, failed to pass through the Senate in a<strong> </strong>52-45 vote. If passed, the TPA would give Congress the ability to review and vote for or against a final trade agreement, but it wouldn\u2019t be able to amend it or filibuster it. By granting the president the authority to negotiate trade agreements, Congress streamlines the process. This is why the TPA is often referred to as \u201cfast-track\u201d.</p> <p>The current TPA bill comes with a big loophole: if Congress feels the TPP doesn\u2019t meet its expectations, it can revoke the TPA and try to change the terms of the trade agreement.</p> <p>Democrats said they would vote in favor of the bill if Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell would combine the fast-track bill with trade legislation addressing currency manipulation,<a href=\"http://www.doleta.gov/tradeact/factsheet.cfm\"> job placement for workers who have lost their jobs as a result of foreign trade</a>, and trade preferences for sub-Saharan Africa.</p> <p>\u201cUntil there is a path to get all four bills passed ... we will, certainly most of us, have to vote no,\u201d Oregon senator Ron Wyden told reporters Tuesday. </p> <p></p> <p><strong>So why does Obama want to fast-track the TPP?</strong></p> <p>The trade agreement is a big deal. Besides the US, it involves 11 other countries and covers about 40% of the world\u2019s economy. In addition to trade, the agreement covers intellectual-property rights and financial regulations. Negotiations have been long and difficult. He wants to present a pact for a final vote and not have to constantly re-negotiate with Congress, special interest groups in the US, and the other countries.</p> <p><strong>Who are the other countries?</strong></p> <p>Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam. The notable exception is China. In part, the deal is meant to tackle China\u2019s dominance in the region. China has its own trade plans under discussion but could one day be part of the TPP.</p> <p><strong>Who is against this trade deal?</strong></p> <p>Among those speaking out against the agreement are unions, workers\u2019 rights groups and environmentalists, all of whom have traditionally been Obama supporters. Many in the president\u2019s own party \u2013 including senators <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/apr/29/so-called-free-trade-policies-hurt-us-workers-every-time-we-pass-them\">Bernie Sanders</a> and Elizabeth Warren \u2013 oppose the trade deal. Free speech advocates and financial reformers are also worried about the deal. Warren is specifically afraid that if it is passed, a <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/05/11/elizabeth-warren-fires-back-at-obama-heres-what-theyre-really-fighting-about/\">future president could use the TPP to change regulations like Dodd-Frank</a> that are meant to safeguard US investors.</p> <p><strong>Who supports the agreement?</strong></p> <p>Big businesses like Nike \u2013 from whose headquarters <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/may/08/obama-nike-free-trade-deal-sanders\">Obama controversially</a> chose to shill for the deal last week \u2013 support the agreement because it would reduce the tariffs on the shoes they produce overseas and then ship to the US. (Right now 98% of shoes in the US are imported.) They also argue free trade will benefit US companies and create more jobs at home. The deal would clarify trade rules that currently ensnare businesses large and small in red tape and arguably make trading in the Pacific rim far easier.</p> <p><strong>Wasn\u2019t there another agreement that promised much the same but cost the US jobs?</strong></p> <p>Yes. That was Nafta \u2013 the North American Free Trade Agreement \u2013 signed in 1994 between the US, Canada and Mexico. As Bernie Sanders points out, post-Nafta the US lost nearly <a href=\"http://www.sanders.senate.gov/download/the-trans-pacific-trade-tpp-agreement-must-be-defeated?inline=file\">700,000 jobs</a>, and over <a href=\"http://www.epi.org/publication/nafta-legacy-growing-us-trade-deficits-cost-682900-jobs/\">60.8% of the lost jobs were in manufacturing</a>.</p> <p>Obama is really tired of people making the Nafta comparison.

    "webTitle": "Global markets rattled over Greece debts as Osborne talks tough on EU in Brussels", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Global markets were rattled on Tuesday by renewed fears that Greece is close to bankruptcy while tough talk from George Osborne on the UK\u2019s position in Europe added to jitters about the region\u2019s future. The first cabinet member of the new Conservative government to visit Brussels, the chancellor met his fellow EU finance ministers to discuss the Greek financial crisis and the region\u2019s economics. But Osborne used the opportunity to warn that Britain would be \u201cresolute and firm\u201d in seeking to repatriate powers before a referendum on whether the UK should quit the union. \u201cWe come here with a very clear mandate to improve Britain\u2019s relationship with the rest of the EU and to reform the EU,\u201d said Osborne. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone is now in any doubt that we will hold that referendum on British membership of the European Union having conducted these negotiations. \u201cWe go into the negotiations aiming to be constructive and engaged but also resolute and firm and no one should underestimate our determination to succeed.\u201d His words received a mixed reaction from his colleagues and EU officials, who say they are keen to hear the British demands and want to avoid a confrontational negotiation about \u201cred lines\u201d and calls for reopening the union\u2019s treaties. \u201cThis is now high on the list of priorities,\u201d said a senior official. \u201cBut it\u2019s up to the British to define what they want.\u201d While last week\u2019s shock Conservative victory has fanned fears of a British exit from the EU, the focus for most of Osborne\u2019s counterparts around the region remains on the fate of heavily indebted Greece. The country\u2019s international lenders \u2013 the European Union, International Monetary Fund and European Central Bank \u2013 reported that progress remained painfully slow in negotiations over the reforms that creditors want to see from Athens before they unlock the latest tranche of bailout funds. After Greece managed to make a \u20ac750m (\u00a3537m) payment to the IMF on Monday, there was cautious optimism that the country\u2019s finances were not quite as stretched as feared. Those hopes were dashed on Tuesday as it emerged Greece had emptied an IMF holding account to find the money. Greece, like all IMF members, holds reserves from the IMF and must pay interest if those holdings are not kept at a certain level. A Greek central bank official told Reuters the funds had been tapped to cover this latest host of payments due from Greece to lenders over coming months. \u201cThe negative is that the account was emptied but, in order to avert a default, it was necessary to weigh the options,\u201d the official told Reuters. The ECB threw a modest lifeline to Greece on Tuesday when it stepped in again to increase the emergency funding available for Greek banks by increasing the cap on emergency liquidity assistance to \u20ac80bn. Economists question how much longer Athens can continue to meet its heavy schedule of debt repayments as well as paying public sector wages and pensions. The fear is that without the \u20ac7.2bn of outstanding bailout money, Greece will end up defaulting on its debts and leave the eurozone. Economists at Daiwa Capital Markets warned about the rising prospects of an \u201caccidental default\u201d by Greece in the absence of fresh funding. They wrote: \u201cThe successful repayment will have reassured euro area finance ministers that the risk of a default to an official creditor has been banished only until next month. And as the repayment was largely funded by clearing out Greece\u2019s IMF reserve account, which will also need to be replenished within a month, it has once again simply added to the arrears in other parts of the Greek public finances. And so, the Greek glass still looks half-empty, and four IMF loan repayments totalling \u20ac1.6bn will come in quick succession in mid-June to provide plenty of opportunities to miss a repayment.\u201d Investors said worries about Greece and the wider eurozone were compounded by volatility in global bond markets where yields spiked higher on Tuesday. That sent jitters through stock markets too, with share indices down around Europe. London\u2019s FTSE 100 index of bluechip shares, which had hit a record high last month, fell 96 points, or 1.4%, to 6,933.8. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index closed down 1.3% at 1,574.61 and Germany\u2019s DAX ended the day down 1.7%. Some analysts put the sharp moves in bond yields down to the recent rebound in oil prices, which has alleviated worries about deflation taking hold. That in turn was prompting markets to adjust their forecasts for when the central banks would start to tighten policy again by raising interest rates. Commenting on the rise in US government bond yields, Kevin Ferriter at the thinktank Capital Economics said: \u201cOne explanation may be that the rise in the oil price has been large enough to assuage concerns about deflation, but small enough not to choke off the recovery. Accordingly, it has given policymakers one less reason to hold fire.\u201d Yields on UK government bonds were also higher as traders tracked moves in German and US debt but also positioned themselves for the Bank of England\u2019s latest inflation and growth forecasts on Wednesday. Bank governor Mark Carney could use his \u201cinflation report\u201d to warn markets they are too relaxed about the timing of future rate rises, economists warn.",

      "bodyText": "The perilous state of Greece\u2019s finances, despite the payment of \u20ac750m owed to the International Monetary Fund, along with a continuing sell off in the bond market put pressure on European markets again. A slight rebound in US Treasuries saw Wall Street recover some ground from its early falls, helping other markets come off their worst levels. The closing scores showed: The FTSE 100 fell 96.05 points or 1.37% to 6933.80 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 1.72% to 11,472.41 France\u2019s Cac closed 1.06% lower at 4974.65 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB lost 0.93% to 23,104.87 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 1.08% lower at 11,322.6 The Athens market finished up 1.37% at 829.1 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 65 points or 0.36%. On that note it\u2019s time to close the blog down for the evening. Sorry about the technical issues earlier, thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back as usual tomorrow. A Reuters snap from the Greek cabinet meeting: 12-May-2015 17:40:34 - GREEK PRIME MINISTER TELLS CABINET THAT GREECE HAS DONE AS MANY STEPS AS POSSIBLE, TIME FOR LENDERS TO MAKE NECESSARY STEPS -GOVT OFFICIAL So here we go again... Oil prices have moved higher again after Opec said demand would be stronger than expected. In its monthly report, the producers said demand this year would be 50,000 barrels a day higher than previously thought, thanks to a lower supply forecast for countries outside the group. Meanwhile the US Energy Information Administration also raised demand forecasts for 2015 and 2016, as well as lowering production guidance. So Brent crude is now 2.8% higher at $66.75 a barrel. Greece\u2019s cabinet is meeting for the second time in three days to debate what concessions to make to its creditors in its proposed reforms to free up much needed bailout cash. The \u20ac750m paid to the International Monetary Fund eases the pressure but not for long, with the country set to run out of cash within a couple of weeks. But in the midst of the Greek crisis, and great uncertainty in the markets, this is a notable fact: Indeed the Athens market is up 1.37% today. Another marker of Greece\u2019s financial woes: Back in the UK, and the country\u2019s economy grew a little more quickly in the three months to April than in the first quarter of the year, according to new estimates. The National Institute of Economic and Social Research said it grew by 0.4% during the period compared to the - preliminary - figure of 0.3% for the three months from January to March. NIESR said: We expect the slight softening of GDP growth experienced in the first quarter of this year to be temporary and forecast the UK economy will expand by 2.5% for the year as a whole. Here\u2019s the full Reuters report on the ECB\u2019s move to increase the emergency funding to Greek banks: The European Central Bank raised the cap on emergency liquidity assistance (ELA) that Greek banks can draw from the country\u2019s central bank by \u20ac1.1bn, taking the ceiling to \u20ac80bn, two banking sources told Reuters on Tuesday. The move comes after eurozone finance ministers on Monday welcomed some progress in slow-moving talks on a cash-for-reform deal between Athens and the IMF, the European Commission and the ECB but said more work was needed to each a deal. \u201cThis leaves an unused liquidity buffer of about \u20ac3.5bn,\u201d one of the banking sources said after an ECB teleconference on Tuesday. The ECB has raised the cap in increments, keeping pressure on Athens to strike a deal with its creditors over economic reforms required to unlock remaining bailout aid. A day earlier than usual, the European Central Bank has increased the emergency funding available for Greek banks: Time for a recap. The UK has begun its push to renegotiate its relationship with Europe, at a gathering of EU finance ministers today. Arriving in Brussels, Chancellor George Osborne drew up the battle lines, declaring: We come here with a very clear mandate to improve Britain\u2019s relationship with the rest of the EU, and to reform the EU so that it creates jobs and increases living standards for all its citizens. I don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s now in any doubt that we will hold that referendum on Britain\u2019s membership of the European Union having conducted these negotiations. We go into the negotiations aiming to be constructive and engaged, but also resolute and firm. And no-one should underestimate our determination to succeed for the working people of Britain, indeed the working people of the whole of the European Union. Britain didn\u2019t raise the issue officially, but the chancellor has used the meeting to gauge enthusiasm and identify allies, as the UK government considers a referendum in 2016 Germany\u2019s finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, told reporters he agreed that the EU could work better: However, Berlin has not dropped its opposition to reopening EU Treaties, which is one of London\u2019s key demands. Sch\u00e4uble said: \u201cWe agreed -- we spoke about this -- that we will both make our contributions to this process.\u201d. \u201cThe British desire to do a couple of things less bureaucratically, to limit abuse of the basic freedoms in EU treaties ... these are all points on which one can find a common solution,\u201d Austria\u2019s finance chief, though, argued that a referendum showed a lack of leadership. And France said Britain must wait until the Greek crisis has been resolved. Fears over Greece\u2019s debts also loomed over the Ecofin meeting. Yesterday\u2019s optimism was dashed by the news that Greece has repaid the IMF with money held in its own emergency IMF account, which must now be replenished within a month. Athens has also revealed that it only has \u20ac600m of cash reserves left - not enough to meet wage and pension demands next month. And in the markets, shares and have fallen sharply amid a rout in government bonds,. which has driven up yields on eurozone debt. The global market selloff has reached New York, where shares are dropping at the start of trading. Ahha... as suspected, Europe remains unwilling to reopen its Treaties for the UK. According to The Times, Germany\u2019s willingness to work with Osborne only went so far.... David Cameron\u2019s spokesman has added that the PM will lay out some further details on his reform plans at the next summit at the end of June (via Reuters) Apologies if the most recent posts are vanishing and coming back, we\u2019re having some technical problems.... GW A flurry of newsflashes from Westminster just landed, showing that Britain is determined to get EU Treaty changes as part of its renegotiation strategy. BRITISH PM CAMERON STANDS BY PLAN TO HOLD REFERENDUM ON BRITAIN\u2019S MEMBERSHIP OF THE EUROPEAN UNION BY THE END OF 2017 - CAMERON SPOKESMAN PM CAMERON COULD HOLD REFERENDUM ON EU MEMBERSHIP EARLIER THAN END OF 2017 IF HE CAN - PM\u2019S SPOKESMAN PM CAMERON IS VERY CLEAR HE WANTS TREATY CHANGE FOR EU REFORMS AS PART OF RENEGOTIATION ON BRITISH MEMBERSHIP - SPOKESMAN PM CAMERON HAS HAD ADVICE THAT TREATY CHANGE IS REQUIRED - PM\u2019S SPOKESMAN PM CAMERON BELIEVES HE NEEDS TIME TO ACHIEVE RENEGOTIATION OF BRITAIN\u2019S TIES WITH THE EU - SPOKESMAN PM CAMERON\u2019S SPOKESMAN SAYS THERE HAS BEEN NO CHANGE TO TIMETABLE FOR REFERENDUM ON BRITAIN\u2019S EU MEMBERSHIP Back in March, European Council president Donald Tusk told the Guardian that it was \u201cvirtually impossible\u201d to reopen treaties for the UK. Of course, that was before Cameron won re-election, and a majority, transforming the referendum from a possibility to a certainty.... Back to Greece, and it appears that Greece\u2019s largest pension fund has taken unorthodox measures to meet next month\u2019s bills. Enikos has the details: The Social Security Foundation (IKA), Greece\u2019s largest pension fund, has decided to take short term loans worth \u20ac360 million in order to pay June\u2019s pensions to its members, financial site enikonomia.gr reports. The decision was made Monday by IKA\u2019s governing board. The loan is comprised of \u20ac150 million in repos from a private bank, using Greek Treasury bonds that IKA owns as collateral, and the rest from cash reserves of three other funds, including \u20ac100 million from the Public Power Corporation (PPC) employees\u2019 insurance fund. That feels rather risky, frankly. But in the short term, it might keep payments flowing until a deal can be struck. Assuming it ever can.... Radio 4\u2019s World At One programme has been discussing the EU referendum. Mike Wood, who won the marginal seat of Dudley South for the Conservatives, is keen to see what George Osborne can win from Brussels, then hold a referendum. Wood has described himself as a eurosceptic, who wants to see \u201ca fundamentally different relationship with the EU to persuade me it\u2019s worth staying in.\u201d France\u2019s finance minister has told reporters that Britain must be patient and wait until the Greek debt dramas has been resolved. I\u2019ve taken the details from Associated Press: French finance minister Michel Sapin said there was no discussion with Osborne of \u201cthe so-called re-negotiation.\u201d \u201cThis will be for tomorrow. After the \u2018Greek weeks\u2019 we will have the \u2018British weeks,\u2019 even if they are not of the same nature,\u201d he said, referencing Greece\u2019s difficulties in securing much-needed bailout cash. But how many more weeks will Greece need? Its bailout programme expires at the end of June, and the whole crisis could escalate unless Athens reaches a deal with creditors soon. Today\u2019s meeting of EU finance ministers has ended, with no signs of further progress over Greece\u2019s bailout crisis or the UK\u2019s push for a new deal. Instead, Ecofin has simply agreed about the need to implement structural reforms to tackle economic imbalances in Europe. Ministers also discussed the looming costs of the ageing populations, which could eat into economic growth in future decades. They also hope to reach agreement on a new scheme, the European fund for strategic investments (EFSI), by June - so it can begin investing in private projects this summer. We also have confirmation that Germany has agreed to work with the UK on EU reform..... Our Europe editor, Ian Traynor, confirms that Germany\u2019s finance minister remains somewhat unimpressed with Greece: J\u0101nis Reirs, Latvia\u2019s representative at Ecofin, was responding to a question from Bruno Waterfield of The Times. Bruno flagged up Osborne\u2019s concerns that eurozone countries could vote as a block and thus damage the single market. Did he push this? It appears not, suggesting that the chancellor restricted his diplomatic efforts to the sidelines of today\u2019s council meeting. Latvia\u2019s finance minister, J\u0101nis Reirs, (corrected), has told reporters that Osborne didn\u2019t raise the UK\u2019s demands officially today: Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble\u2019s press conference is being streamed here. Newsflash: Germany\u2019s Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble has just told reporters in Brussels that he agrees with George Osborne - Europe needs reforming. 11:27:23 - GERMAN FINANCE MINISTER SCHAEUBLE SAYS AGREED WITH OSBORNE TO MAKE REFORMS IN EU Sch\u00e4uble was less complimentary about Greece, though, in his news conference with the media: 12-May-2015 11:21:47 - GERMAN FINANCE MINISTER SCHAEUBLE SAYS IMPROVEMENT IN GREEK TALKS CLIMATE NOT MATCHED BY SUBSTANCE Ministers are starting to emerge from the Ecofin meeting in Brussels. French finance minister Michel Sapin has revealed that finance ministers congratulated Osborne on the election result , but didn\u2019t discuss his mandate for reform. For readers just joining us, here\u2019s Associated Press\u2019s write-up of George Osborne\u2019s tub-thumping comments in Brussels today, with some history of Britain\u2019s often troubled relationship with Europe. Britain\u2019s Osborne spells out mandate on EU referendum British finance minister George Osborne insisted Tuesday that his recently re-elected Conservative government has a \u201cvery clear mandate\u201d to push ahead with discussions to reform the European Union ahead of a planned referendum on British membership of the bloc. Arriving for talks Tuesday with fellow finance ministers from the 28-country EU, Osborne said his Conservative Party will aim to \u201cimprove Britain\u2019s relationship with the rest of the EU and to reform the EU so it creates jobs and increases living standards for all its citizens.\u201d A referendum on Britain\u2019s membership of the EU by the end of 2017 was a key plank of the Conservatives\u2019 winning manifesto in the British general election last week. Osborne, who is set to be one of the lead negotiators, refused to address growing speculation that the referendum may be brought forward a year to 2016. Many in his party and within business think the referendum should take place earlier than planned because it would reduce uncertainty and won\u2019t clash with general elections in Germany and France. He said: \u201cWe go into these negotiations aiming to be constructive and engaged but also resolute and firm, and no one should underestimate our determination to succeed for the working people of Britain and indeed for the working people of the European Union.\u201d Since it joined what was then known as the European Economic Community in 1973, Britain\u2019s membership has often been strained. Over the past few years, a growing groundswell of opinion in the country thinks exiting the EU is the best option for the country especially at a time when many of its members are getting closer together, notably with the creation of the euro currency. In last week\u2019s election, the U.K. Independence Party, which aims to get Britain out of the EU, won 4 million votes. The Europe question has troubled the Conservative Party for decades. Splits within the party were notable in the 1990s when many EU countries were preparing for the euro, and contributed to its spell in opposition between 1997 and 2010. Many think that Prime Minister David Cameron has opted for a referendum to shore up his party, which is still divided over the merits of Britain\u2019s membership. [end] I do wish I could have eavesdropped the moment when George Osborne chatted with Austria\u2019s finance minister. The handshake came minutes after Hans Jorg Schelling suggested that a referendum showed a lack of political backbone.... Another Greek development -- prime minister Alexis Tsipras has called a cabinet meeting for 2 PM local time (noon BST). Over to Helena again: Tsipras is expected to present the agreement (in so far as it has been thrashed out to date) to ministers although insiders are not EXCLUDING that he may also take a a firmer step on the issue of a referendum being held - and might even announce a date for the plebiscite. Media and analysts in Greece this morning believe it is almost inevitable that a deal will now be put to public vote. But as the leading commentator Alexis Papachelas told SKAI News today: \u201cthere is almost no-one who believes that negotiations over a [long-term] deal will end in June. Everyone is saying journalists should be prepared to work right the way through the summer and ensure they are around in June, July, early August.\u201d Over in Greece the government has released figures showing just how low public finances are running. Helena Smith reports from Athens: In a move that puts Greece\u2019s credit crunch into perspective, prime minister Alexis Tsipras\u2019 government has revealed that it has just over \u20ac600m euro in cash reserves. A presidential degree allowing the state to sequester the funds of public bodies has seen \u20ac64.5m being transferred from local authorities to the Central Bank of Greece, said a government statement released this morning. Some \u20ac535.8m have been transferred from \u201cother bodies [representing] general government\u201d it added. The statement\u2019s timing \u2013 hours after Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis\u2019 alarming warning that the country could go bust \u201cin a couple of weeks\u201d \u2013 is clearly aimed at focusing minds as EU finance ministers meet in Brussels. It comes amid mounting fears of a Graccident \u2013 described by the leading economist Mohammed El Erian today as potentially \u201cdevastating for Greece\u2019s long-suffering population.\u201d He wrote in a column for Bloomberg today. \u201cThe probability of such a Graccident are now around 50 percent, as financial and economic conditions continue to worsen. That brings the probability of muddling along for a long time to below 50 percent, and they are declining,\u201d It has emerged that Greece met yesterday\u2019s \u20ac750m debt repayment to the International Monetary Fund with money held at the IMF itself. Athens officials have revealed today that most of the money (around \u20ac650m) came from Greece\u2019s holding account at the Fund, which is there for emergencies. One official told Reuters: \u201cWe made use of money in our holding account in the fund.... \u201cThe government also used about 100 million of its cash reserves.\u201d This underlines the concern about Greece\u2019s liquidity position, especially as it must now replenish those reserves (but probably not for several weeks). David Madden, market analyst at IG, blame the Greek crisis for today\u2019s stock market selloff, which is accelerating as I type. European equity markets are sustaining heavy losses as Athens gives with one hand and takes with another. No sooner had Greece got back into traders\u2019 good books after making a repayment to the IMF, a comment from Yanis Varoufakis about the country\u2019s solvency sparked a new selloff. That\u2019s a reference to Varoufakis\u2019s warning that the Greek liquidity situation is now \u201cterribly urgent\u201d. And with the FTSE 100 now down a chunky 2%, it could be a bad day in the City.... The sterling rally shows that City traders suspect UK interest rates may rise earlier than thought: The equity selloff has deepened too, knocking 119 points off the FTSE 100 index; another sign that monetary conditions could tighten.... The pound has jumped on the back of the jump in UK industrial production. Sterling hit its highest level of the year against the US dollar, at $1.5628. Some upbeat economic news -- UK industrial production grew at its fastest rate in six months in March. Industrial output rose by 0.5%, according to the Office for National Statistics, mainly due to a pick-up in oil and gas activity. Back in Brussels, George Osborne has been catching up with fellow finance ministers, as he begin his push to renegotiate Britain\u2019s EU membership. It\u2019s the first time the\u2019ve met up since the General Election. (I wonder how many expected to see him back?) Spain\u2019s El Mundo newspaper is reporting that the International Monetary Fund is reluctant to fund a third Greek bailout. It says the Fund is disappointed by the lack of progress this year, and also concerned that the new Greek government is unwinding some of the previous austerity measures, by rehiring public workers. Business Insider has a good take: REPORT: The IMF won\u2019t join in a third bailout for Greece It seems likely that Greece will need another financial assistance programme when the current deal with the eurozone ends at the end of June. Its existing IMF deal runs until 2016. Over in the City, shares are dropping this morning. The blue-chip FTSE 100 is down almost 1%, as markets across Europe are bathed in red. The main driver is a big selloff in the government bond market which is driving up the yields (or interest rates) on sovereign debt. So, what\u2019s happening in the bond market? One theory is that capital is flowing out of bonds and into other riskier assets, because traders are actually less worried about Greece defaulting: Peter Rosenstreich, Head of Market Strategy at Swissquote, explains: Risk of a disorderly or straight non-payment by Greece has helped compress yields (as traders piled into safe haven). The lowering of this event risk is allowing capital to search for quality higher returns. Predictions of higher inflation are also hitting bond prices (which fall when yields rise). In the eurozone, that would suggest that the ECB might not run its QE programme (which mops up eurozone bonds) for as long as expected. A third factor is that the market has become dangerously illiquid, because investors have bought so many bonds in recent years (driving yields down to record lows). That can lead to wild swings when everyone tries to sell at once.... Newsnight\u2019s Duncan Weldon explains: German journalist Ines Zoettl of Capital Magazine isn\u2019t impressed with George Osborne\u2019s timing: And Bruno Waterfield of The Times fears that the government is keeping the UK in the dark over its renegotiation plans: Reuters has now published the Austrian finance minister\u2019s criticism of an in/out referendum on Britain\u2019s EU membership. Hans Joerg Schelling told reporters in Brussels that: \u201cI think politicians have to act decisively. And when politicians believe they have to ask the people, it\u2019s an indication that they themselves are not willing to make the decisions and carry the consequences.\u201d[End] A sign that Osborne may get a rough ride at today\u2019s Ecofin meeting? Austria\u2019s finance minister, Hans J\u00f6rg Schelling, has just given a taste of the opposition Britain may face over EU renegotiations. According to Reuters, Scheling suggested the referendum was a sign of weakness: 12-May-2015 08:25:12 - AUSTRIAN FINANCE MINISTER SAYS BRITISH REFERENDUM PLAN SHOWS BRITISH POLITICIANS ARE NOT WILLING TO TAKE TOUGH DECISIONS ON THEIR OWN You can watch George Osborne\u2019s comments on EU reform here: George Osborne has just arrived in Brussels for today\u2019s Ecofin meeting, and declared that he\u2019s determined to reform the EU for the benefit of Britain, and the rest of Europe too. The chancellor told the media outside the Justus Lipsius building that: We come here with a very clear mandate to improve Britain\u2019s relationship with the rest of the EU, and to reform the EU so that it creates jobs and increases living standards for all its citizens. I don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s now in any doubt that we will hold that referendum on Britain\u2019s membership of the European Union having conducted these negotiations. We go into the negotiations aiming to be constructive and engaged, but also resolute and firm. And no-one should underestimate our determination to succeed for the working people of Britain, indeed the working people of the whole of the European Union. As Osborne headed inside the meeting, a reporter asked whether the referendum could come as early as 2016 (as the Guardian reports today) but there was no reply. Chancellor George Osborne has confirmed that Greece, and Britain\u2019s membership of the European Union, will both be discussed at today\u2019s meeting in Brussels. Carolyn McCall, the boss of budget airline easyJet, has warned that Britain would suffer if it left the European Union: She was speaking after easyJet reported it had returned to profit, partly thanks to the fall in the oil price and the weaker euro. Jeroen Dijsselbloem, head of the eurogroup of finance ministers, has echoed Yanis Varoufakis\u2019s warning that Greece\u2019s financial position is increasingly precarious. He told Bloomberg that: Liquidity is getting more difficult, obviously, as time goes by\u2026 Finance ministers should be arriving in Brussels any moment, and may speak to the media on their way into the Ecofin. They\u2019re due to have breakfast at 8am BST, then discuss various issues including EU investment and macroeconomic imbalances. It should be wrapped up before lunchtime, according to the agenda. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. European finance ministers are gathering at the Justus Lipsius building in Brussels this morning for an Ecofin Council meeting, with the Greek bailout crisis casting a shadow over their work. Last night, finance minister Yanis Varoufakis warned that Greece\u2019s financial situation is now \u201cterribly urgent\u201d, suggesting it could blow up before the end of this month. Varoufakis told reporters that: \u201cThe liquidity issue is a terribly urgent issue. It\u2019s common knowledge, let\u2019s not beat around the bush.... From the perspective [of timing], we are talking about the next couple of weeks.\u201d Varoufakis\u2019s warning brought us back to earth with a bump, following the news that Greece had begun repaying \u20ac750m to the International Monetary Fund a day before today\u2019s deadline. That repayment has eased fears of a default in May (although it also means we have one less thing to watch out for today). While eurozone finance ministers did credit Greece with making more progress towards a deal, there is still deadlock over several crucial issues - including pensions and labour reform. And without more progress, it\u2019s hard to see the European Central Bank relaxing its rules to ease the liquidity crisis. Varoufakis also insisted that a Greek referendum isn\u2019t on the radar screen right now, a day after Germany\u2019s finance minister suggested it could be a good idea (thanks, Wolfgang). If you missed yesterday\u2019s action, here\u2019s Monday\u2019s liveblog: George Osborne, Britain\u2019s finance minister, is attending Ecofin this morning -- meaning that the prospect of a referendum on the UK\u2019s EU membership will surely be discussed in the corridors and backrooms of Brussels. As our chief political correspondent Nick Watt reports: George Osborne, the chancellor, will meet other European finance ministers at a summit in Brussels on Tuesday. The issue of Britain\u2019s membership of the EU is not on the official agenda, but it is expected to be raised informally. A parliamentary bill to approve the referendum will be included in the Queen\u2019s speech on 27 May. The bill will be formally tabled in the House of Commons shortly afterwards to ensure that the prime minister has the option of holding the referendum next year. More here: European stock markets are expected to dip in early trading, as traders worry about Greece\u2019s bailout. Capital Spreads dealer Jonathan Sudaria says: \u201cReaching an agreement remains difficult to achieve despite expectations for Greece to commit a number of reforms to unlock aid.\u201d And there are signs of tension in the bond market, after the yields on longer-term US debt jumped last night. I\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day.",

      "bodyText": "Allan Leighton, chairman of the Co-operative Group, has told the independent societies which own 22% of the supermarkets and funeral home business that elections to the board will be run differently next year. The promise by Leighton \u2013 and Lesley Reznicek, president of the members council which represents the 7 million individual members who own the rest of the Co-op \u2013 comes amid mounting controversy over the way three member-nominated directors have been put forward for election to the board. The three were selected from a shortlist of six and are standing for three boardroom seats \u2013 avoiding contested elections that some veteran Co-op activists had hoped for. In a letter also sent to the 100 or so representatives on the members council, Leighton and Reznicek wrote: \u201cThe first election is taking place now with three strong candidates standing for these inaugural roles. Opportunities to strengthen this new process have been identified.\u201d Leighton was appointed as the first independent chair of the Co-op in February as part of a series of corporate governance changes following the record \u00a32.5bn loss in 2014 caused by the crisis in its banking arm and an over-expansion of its supermarkets. He will chair his first AGM on Saturday \u2013 the first under a new one-member one-vote system under which about 2.7m members are eligible to participate. The letter added: \u201cThe board and council have committed to work together to develop enhanced arrangements for future elections. Work to improve the process will begin immediately after the AGM and a key outcome will be to maximise the potential for contested elections, with strong candidates who meet the required criteria.\u201d The letter promises a wide-ranging review which will include \u201ca development programme for potential candidates, an improved nominations process, and selection and assessment to be conducted jointly by the board and council\u201d. The three member-nominated directors will join a new board being built by Leighton, the former Royal Mail chairman who is best known for turning around Asda. Leighton and Richard Pennycook, the chief executive, met the board of the Midcounties \u2013 the largest of the independent societies \u2013 on Monday night and made clear there was no intention of changing the current process.

Work to improve the process will begin immediately after the AGM and a key outcome will be to maximise the potential for contested elections, with strong candidates who meet the required criteria.\u201d</p> <p>The letter promises a wide-ranging review which will include \u201ca development programme for potential candidates, an improved nominations process, and selection and assessment to be conducted jointly by the board and council\u201d.</p> <p>The three member-nominated directors will join a new board being built by Leighton, the former Royal Mail chairman who is best known for turning around Asda.</p> <p>Leighton and Richard Pennycook, the chief executive, met the board of the Midcounties \u2013 the largest of the independent societies \u2013 on Monday night and made clear there was no intention of changing the current process.</p> <p>The Midcounties has a legal opinion that argues that the board would be void if the election takes place.

Enterprise said it would continue to offer tied deals but would increase the number of pubs it manages directly from 16 now to between 750 and 850 by September 2020. </p> <p>In all it expects to cut its number of pubs from more than 5,000 to around 4,000.</p> <p>It will also expand its commercial property arm from 185 properties to between 900 and 1,000.</p> <p>The announcement of its new strategy came as Enterprise reported a 0.6% rise in six month net income to \u00a3178m. It said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Trading in the first few weeks of the second half is in line with our expectations. Comparatives in our third quarter are particularly challenging as they include enhanced trading from the FIFA world cup and the full benefit of the Easter trading period, whereas this year the earlier Easter accrued some benefit to our second quarter.</p> <p>However we continue to target growth in like for like net income for the full year.</p> </blockquote> <p>Mark Brumby at Langton Capital said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Enterprise has reported numbers broadly in line with forecasts and has reassured that trading remains in line with expectations.</p> <p>As regards the strategic review, Enterprise has concluded that it needs to managed its estate much more actively.</p> <p> This cannot be achieved via a spreadsheet and the group intends to grow a managed business.

      "bodyText": "Enterprise Inns has reacted to a planned new law giving tenants more freedom with proposals to reduce its pub estate by more than 1,000, create a property rental arm and increase the number of managed pubs. The new rules will allow publicans to choose where to buy their beer, rather than being tied to supply deals with their landlords, under a market rent-only option. Enterprise said it would continue to offer tied deals but would increase the number of pubs it manages directly from 16 now to between 750 and 850 by September 2020. In all it expects to cut its number of pubs from more than 5,000 to around 4,000. It will also expand its commercial property arm from 185 properties to between 900 and 1,000. The announcement of its new strategy came as Enterprise reported a 0.6% rise in six month net income to \u00a3178m. It said: Trading in the first few weeks of the second half is in line with our expectations. Comparatives in our third quarter are particularly challenging as they include enhanced trading from the FIFA world cup and the full benefit of the Easter trading period, whereas this year the earlier Easter accrued some benefit to our second quarter. However we continue to target growth in like for like net income for the full year. Mark Brumby at Langton Capital said: Enterprise has reported numbers broadly in line with forecasts and has reassured that trading remains in line with expectations. As regards the strategic review, Enterprise has concluded that it needs to managed its estate much more actively. This cannot be achieved via a spreadsheet and the group intends to grow a managed business. This was to be expected but, at around 800 units, it could be a little larger than had been previously thought. This response seems correct but it will not be without execution risk. Where will the staff come from, for example? The structure will need to be created and the demand for managers will increase markedly. Salaries could rise as a result and this will impact the industry as a whole but, as they say, unintended consequences are, well, unintended. But that doesn\u2019t make them any less real and, as Enterprise begins its progression from a company with the middle-hundreds of staff to one with perhaps 15,000, it will need to execute its plan flawlessly in order to avoid hiccups. We believe that this, rather than being a negative, should help to focus the market on the true worth of the company \u2013 and on that of Punch Taverns. Unfortunately, the market rent-only option, for which the secondary legislation will only be prepared in the autumn, has injected a note of uncertainty into proceedings but the response OF Enterprise under the circumstances appears to be measured and correct \u2013 and inevitable. We are not entirely pessimistic with regards to the outcome and believe that there is some upside risk developing in the share prices of ETI and other impacted pub companies. Analysts at Stifel said: While the shares have recovered from depressed levels in recent weeks, the rating is low. However, the outlook is clouded by regulatory uncertainty and the group remains highly levered. The strategic review indicates major change, but the impact on profits from these initiatives and the market rent-only option legislation is unclear.",

      "bodyText": "1. The economy is not getting all that much worse, but it isn\u2019t getting any better The past year has been an odd time for the economy and the budget numbers reflect this. The glory days of the mining boom are now well and truly in the rear mirror \u2013 as firmly in the past as the government hopes your memory of last year\u2019s budget is. Thankfully for the government, this year\u2019s budget does not see masses of writedowns in economic parameters but neither, for all the increases in debt and deficit compared to last year, or even compared to the mid-year economic and fiscal outlook (Myefo), does the economic situation appear much improved. Economic growth for 2015-16 in last year\u2019s budget (and indeed in all budgets which had forecast growth for this year) was 3%. That was not an especially impressive number given that over the past 20-odd years Australia\u2019s economy has grown by about 3.1% to 3.2% each year. The Myefo didn\u2019t say the picture had improved at all \u2013 3% remained the outlook. But now the government only expects the economy to grow by 2.75% over the next 12 months. This is rather less than is required to get unemployment to start to fall. Not surprisingly, then, the unemployment situation is not improved. The Myefo anticipated the unemployment rate reaching 6.5% in 2015-16 and falling to 6% in the following year before getting under 6% by June 2018. The government still expects unemployment to get to 6.5% but now expects it to take a year longer to get below 6%. Not until 2018-19 do the budget papers predict unemployment at 5.75%. And despite better labour force participation over the next 12 months, the government now expects employment to grow by just 1.5% compared to the 1.75% it was hoping for when it did the Myefo: The other economic indicators have mostly been revised down as well. Business investment, export growth, household spending and the terms of trade are all worse than expected last December. Only investment in dwellings has been revised up. Last year in both the budget and the Myefo, investment in dwelling was expected to rise 5.5%. Now \u2013 on the back of the housing boom, with record low interest rates \u2013 it is expected to grow 6.5%: 2. Revenue writedowns are still there, but revenue growth is strong The one thing the government cannot complain too loudly about is collapsing revenue. Sure, it is less than they hoped it would be in the Myefo. Company tax revenue, for example, is down $2.6bn (3.7%) on those predictions. Similarly, overall taxation receipts are down $6.46bn (1.7%) on what was predicted last December. But the actual growth in revenue is surprisingly strong. Over the next four years revenue in real terms is expected to grow on average by 4.2% each year. That\u2019s the strongest real growth in revenue over four years since the spell from 2004-05 to 2007-08 (inclusive). In effect the government is hoping revenue will rise as strongly as it did during the mining boom period: For the three years from 2016-17, the budget expects company tax revenue to grow by around 8% on average. By contrast from 2008-09 to 2015-16 company tax revenue grew by just 1.6% on average each year. If that strong growth occurs it will be a pretty impressive effort. And bear in mind the revenue prediction is based on an iron ore price of just US$48 a tonne \u2013 which is lower than it currently is. If it all goes to plan, by 2018-19, the government expects to raise 25.2% of GDP in revenue. The last time that amount was raised was in 2005-06. Wayne Swan, by contrast, had to make do during his time as treasurer with an average of 22.4% of GDP. 3. So, about that austerity\u2026 Pretty much everything in this year\u2019s budget is an attempt to hit the voting public with a Men in Black-style amnesia ray. Last year we needed to be austere. Heck, the budget was in such an emergency that without tough and hard cuts to everyone \u2013 especially those on welfare \u2013 then all sorts of hell would occur. This year? Well, it\u2019s all about fairness, and fairness costs money. In the pre-election economic and fiscal outlook (Pefo) government expenditure in 2015-16 was expected to be 24.6% of GDP. In the 2013-14 Myefo, which the government used to try and dump the debt and deficit on the former ALP, that figure grew to 25.2% of GDP. In last year\u2019s budget the cuts were on in earnest and the spending was now down to 24.8% of GDP. But that didn\u2019t last long, and by December\u2019s Myefo it was back up to 25.7%. But in this year\u2019s budget it now expects spending in 2015-16 to be 25.9% of GDP. The only time government expenditure has been that high in the past 20 years was in the global financial crisis stimulus year of 2009-10. In terms of growth of expenditure, the next four years will see government spending grow by 1.8% on average. That\u2019s not especially high, but rather oddly it has smallish growth in the next two to three years, and then in 2018-19 expenditure is expected to grow by 3.2% in real terms \u2013 driven by increased spending for the National Disability Insurance Scheme. 4. So, about that small government\u2026 Last year, for the first time, the budget papers included a \u201ccall on resource\u201d figure. This added together the amount of revenue raised and the size of the deficit. It was a bizarre set of numbers that no one ever really refers to because it is rather meaningless. The government attempted to suggest this figure demonstrated that not only was the ALP\u2019s deficit bad but that, given its lust for taxation, it was massively intruding into the Australian economy. In last year\u2019s budget the government had this combination of deficit and revenue peaking in 2013-14 at 26.4% of GDP. From there on it shrank until by 2017-18 it was down to 25.5% of GDP. This year, however, the return to small government seems a bit old hat. Now it has revised down the call on resources in 2013-14 to 26.1% of GDP, and it rises to 26.7% of GDP in 2015-16 and 2016-17. By this measure the government is calling on the resources of the economy to an extent that has not been seen since 1986-87: Another way of looking at the size of the government is to combine revenue and expenditure. By 2018-19 revenue and expenditure equal 50.5% of GDP. That is the highest combination of those two amounts since the Bob Hawke years of 1987-88. You can say what you like about this government, but you can\u2019t criticise it for being small. 5. But to what end? Whatever Joe Hockey might like to say about the \u201ctimetable back to surplus\u201d, given the deficit has increased since last year, now we\u2019re only expected to get back into surplus in 2019-20 rather than 2018-19. Last year it was hoped the budget deficit in 2017-18 would be $2.8bn. By the Myefo this has been revised to $11.5bn. In this year\u2019s budget they now expect the deficit in 2017-18 to be $24.7bn: But the speed at which financesback to surplus is pretty much unchanged. Because of the increasing revenue, the budget deficit is still expected to be reduced over the next four years by about 0.6% of GDP each year: That consolidation is not overly austere, and certainly well below the 1% of GDP average that occurred in the first four years of the Howard government. But for all the extra spending, the slowish return to surplus is not doing much to help the economy. Public demand over the next two years is expected to grow by just 1.5% each year. That\u2019s an incredibly low level at a time when private demand growth is expected to be just 1.25% this year: The wash up from this budget is that we have a government desperate to undo the political damage of last year\u2019s budget, but which, for all its extra spending, appears to have done little to assist the overall economy. Economy growth is slower than expected last year; unemployment is higher than expected last year. At best you can say this is a budget of very low expectations for the future, but it does smack of a government that has targeted spending towards not so much improving growth, but improving its polling.",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s industrial sector bounced back to growth in March, helped by a resurgence in oil and gas production and steadily improving factory output. The healthy figures will cheer George Osborne in the wake of the Conservative election victory after a run of lacklustre data showed the economy slowing sharply in the first three months of the year. The rise in oil production was the largest since March 2014 and analysts hoped this marked a bottoming out for an industry badly hit by last year\u2019s oil price fall. Investors reacted by pushing the pound higher, but the stock market reeled at the news, sending the FTSE 100 tumbling by more than 140 points, or 2% before it settled at 6933, down 1.4% or 96 points. Stock markets have recovered strongly over the past year as the prospect of interest rate rises receded until later this year in the US and next year in the UK. Analysts explained that the better than expected industrial figures would put pressure on the Bank of England to bring forward its first base rate rise, from 2016 to as early as November. The likelihood of higher rates will persuade some investors to move away from equity markets in favour of bond markets, which are considered safer, but have have offered poor returns in recent years while interest rates have remained low. The Bank\u2019s governor, Mark Carney, is expected to warn investors at the presentation of his quarterly inflation report on Wednesday that the economy remains strong and it would be complacent to rule out an earlier rate rise. The National Institute of Economic and Social Research reported that its monthly growth forecast had risen to 0.4% for the three months to April from 0.3% in the first three months of the year. Marking a turnaround from falling GDP growth before and after Christmas, the institute said it remained upbeat about the prospects for growth. It said: \u201cWe expect the slight softening of GDP growth experienced in the first quarter of this year to be temporary and forecast the UK economy will expand by 2.5% for the year as a whole.\u201d The Office for National Statistics found that industrial production rose 0.5% in March on the previous month as mining and quarrying climbed 2.6%, while oil and gas output increased by 4.9% and contributed 0.5 percentage points to total production. Manufacturing output also gathered strength following a surge in pharmaceutical output to record growth of 0.4% on the previous month. Howard Archer, the chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said political uncertainty had evaporated since the election. He said: \u201cThe prospects for manufacturers seem pretty healthy on the domestic demand front, especially for consumer goods. \u201cMeanwhile, the underlying fundamentals for business investment still seem decent overall, which will hopefully support demand for capital goods, especially now that the risk of political uncertainty and instability has essentially disappeared for the time being following the Conservative\u2019s gaining of a majority in the general election.\u201d Chris Williamson, the chief economist at financial data provider Markit, was more concerned to emphasise the continuing weakness of the recovery. He said: \u201cThe overall picture in fact remains one of a manufacturing economy that is struggling to expand in the face of the stronger pound and heightened business uncertainty. \u201cThe near stagnation of the sector over the first quarter is a reminder of how little progress the UK has made in terms of rebalancing towards manufacturing and will probably do little to persuade the Bank of England that the economy is ready for higher interest rates.\u201d After a surge in growth across the manufacturing sector in 2013 and the first half of 2014, factory output has slowed, adding just 1.1% over the past year. Osborne plans to strengthen efforts to rebalance the economy in favour of industrial activity and the government took a step in that direction with the by naming the Tory rising star James Wharton as the \u201cnorthern powerhouse\u201d minister. The appointment of the Stockton South MP was welcomed by the vice-chancellor of Sheffield University, Sir Keith Burnett, who said: \u201cGeorge Osborne has promised investment in major infrastructure projects and innovation.

The FTSE 100 is currently 84.10 points lower at 6945.75, with the recent election rally and positive reaction to China\u2019s latest interest rate cut seeming a long way off. The fall in bond prices - in Europe and overnight in the US - is doing some of the damage, with a number of reasons cited for the decline, including raised inflation expectations, an illiquid market and concerns the European Central Bank might end its bond buying programme early. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: A sell-off in US treasuries yesterday saw US stocks slip lower, as yields started to push higher again, the 10 year closing at its highest level this year. European bond markets also started to succumb to the same selling pressure that we saw in the middle of last week, with German bunds also coming under pressure again, on receding deflation concerns. On top of that, the fact that Greece has paid the \u20ac750m owed to the International Monetary Fund has merely drawn attention to the next set of payments, with the country\u2019s financial situation still precarious and talk of a vote on its future in the eurozone adding to the uncertainty. Better than expected UK industrial production figures have prompted renewed speculation of interest rate rises and sent sterling higher. But mining group Anglo American is bucking the downward trend, adding 6.5p to 1134.5p on talk it could profitably sell its iron ore business, perhaps to the Chinese, following recent declines in the metal\u2019s price.

Among the fallers easyJet is down 135p at \u00a316.98 as the budget airline issued a cautious outlook on the third quarter, due to the costs of strike-related disruption and a fall in underlying trading, partly hurt by the timing of Easter.

    "webTitle": "EasyJet flushes rumours of downsized toilets on its planes as shares plunge", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "EasyJet has moved swiftly to allay fears of shrinking toilets on its planes after it announced they would be pushed further down the fuselage to cut costs. Almost half the budget airline\u2019s fleet will be refitted in the next three years, adding six more seats on each of its 180-seat Airbus A320s. EasyJet\u2019s chief financial officer, Chris Kennedy, said the move was about \u201cmaintaining passenger comfort and reducing the cost\u201d, and suggested that the size of the toilets would diminish. Carolyn McCall, the chief executive, said: \u201cWe don\u2019t believe that passengers will notice it.\u201d She said that the modifications were being checked over by design teams at the manufacturer\u2019s HQ in France and told journalists they should \u201cgo to Toulouse\u201d \u2013 where Airbus is based \u2013 if they were concerned. She said: \u201cAirbus could have cottoned on to this a bit earlier on ... Everyone knows redesigns should optimise spaces. That\u2019s what they\u2019ve done now and added in one row.\u201d However, after checks, an easyJet spokesman said: \u201cWe can confirm that the new redesigned toilet has been reconfigured to ensure the ceiling height above the toilet remains the full height of the cabin and remains the same as previously.\u201d EasyJet has promised that passengers will not feel the squeeze, as the seat pitch will not change, and thinner seatbacks should increase legroom. The airline swung to a record first-half profit as fuel costs fell, but shares dropped after it warned that currency movements and an industrial dispute in France would cut revenue per seat and dent full-year profits. In the six months to the end of March, easyJet recorded a \u00a37m pretax profit compared with a \u00a353m loss a year earlier. Airlines traditionally suffer a loss in the first half of the year before recovering over the summer. Revenue rose 3.8% to \u00a31.77bn, helped by strong demand at the end of the ski season. Fuel costs fell from \u00a3537m to \u00a3516m. The group gained \u00a314m from the weaker euro as lower costs more than offset weakened revenue caused by the currency\u2019s fall against sterling. However, easyJet said exchange rate movements were likely to reduce profit by about \u00a340m in the second half of the year and \u00a320m for the full year. EasyJet shares fell 9.5% to \u00a316.56, making the company the biggest loser in the FTSE 100 index. McCall said: \u201cThe profit in the half reflects the delivery of our customer-focused revenue initiatives and a strong finish to the ski season, as well as the benefit we received from the lower fuel price and favourable foreign exchange movements.\u201d EasyJet said it was forced to cancel more than 600 flights in April, mainly owing to strikes by French air traffic controllers. The disruption will reduce annual profit by about \u00a325m. As a result, revenue per seat in the third quarter would fall by about four percentage points, the company said. The airline said it faced increased airport charges and a potential navigational charge of \u00a312m, which it is disputing. Mike van Dulken, the head of research at the spread betting firm Accendo Markets, said: \u201cEasyJet shares are in freefall this morning as hitherto loyal investors react to a weak outlook for the third quarter [revenue per seat to fall] and the prospect of the second half suffering from a significant \u00a340m foreign exchange hit, offsetting what is otherwise good news on the first half with pretax profits near the top end of consensus.\u201d McCall said summer bookings were in line with last year and the group would continue to perform well as fares go down because of its attractive destinations and low costs. At current exchange rates and with the price of fuel remaining stable, easyJet\u2019s fuel bill is likely to fall by between \u00a395m and \u00a3120m. She said better economic conditions and reduced fuel costs would cause the supply of short-haul flights to increase by 6.7% in easyJet\u2019s markets during the second half of its financial year. Airlines have benefited from the falling cost of fuel, driven by the sharp reduction in the oil price between last summer and the start of 2015. British Airways\u2019 parent company, IAG, reported a first-quarter profit for the first time last month. McCall also reiterated easyJet\u2019s opposition to Gatwick expansion, with the Airports Commission\u2019s recommendation for a new runway expected soon. She said: \u201cThe funding requirements are extremely onerous before anything gets better, it will be very disruptive to passengers, and there is no demand \u2013 but everyone is screaming for more capacity at Heathrow. Everyone in British business is saying why don\u2019t they just get on with Heathrow.\u201d She said easyJet would also be lobbying strongly for Britain to remain in the EU, after the Conservative government\u2019s reported moves to bring forward a referendum. McCall added: \u201cWe were born from deregulation in the EU. It is definitely in Britain\u2019s interest for us to remain in the EU.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The government has cut its stake in Lloyds Banking Group to less than 20%, taking the amount returned from the bailed-out bank to the taxpayer to more than \u00a310bn. The Treasury said it sold \u00a3500m of Lloyds shares to reduce its holding by a percentage point to 19.93%. The sale was made under a trading plan set up in December to gradually sell shares. The shares were sold for more than the average price paid for the government\u2019s stake, which was 73.6p. The government has sold more than \u00a32.5bn of shares under the trading plan to reduce its stake from 24.9% when the plan was announced. Taxpayers were left owning 43% of Lloyds after the government rescued the bank at the peak of the financial crisis in 2008-09. The government has been selling shares since September 2013 after the company\u2019s financial performance recovered. The chancellor, George Osborne, said: \u201cI\u2019m delighted that we\u2019ve now raised over \u00a310bn from selling our shares in Lloyds Bank. This means we have recovered over half of the taxpayers\u2019 money put into Lloyds and now own less than 20% of the bank.\u201d Osborne said in his budget that he intended to sell at least \u00a39bn of Lloyds shares this financial year. The trading plan is set to close by the end of June. Lloyds announced in February that it would pay a dividend for the first time since the government bailout, increasing the appeal of its shares. Underlying profit rose 26% to \u00a37.8bn last year as the bank cut costs and bad debts fell. A Lloyds spokesperson said: \u201cToday\u2019s announcement shows the further progress made in returning Lloyds Banking Group to full private ownership and enabling the taxpayer to get their money back. This reflects the hard work undertaken over the last four years to transform the group into a simple, low-risk and customer-focused bank.\u201d",
