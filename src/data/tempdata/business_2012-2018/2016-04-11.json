      "bodyText": "British retailers saw sales drop last month as unsettled weather hit demand for clothes while takings at grocers were hurt by lower food prices and Easter closures, industry figures show. The British Retail Consortium (BRC) said like-for-like sales fell 0.7% in March on a year earlier, the biggest drop since last August. Sales were flat on a year ago in total terms, which does not adjust for the effect of new store openings. The trade group said its latest figures were distorted by the timing of Easter, which fell in March this year as opposed to April in 2015. But it said the underlying trend was weak, with rolling 12-month average sales growth at just 1.4%, the slowest pace since last August. The BRC\u2019s chief executive, Helen Dickinson, described the March figures as relatively disappointing and said retailers were also feeling longer-standing pressures. \u201cThis slowdown can\u2019t be viewed in isolation; retail is an industry undergoing significant structural change as the investment in the digital offer continues apace while, from a consumer perspective, more disposable income is being spent on leisure and entertainment,\u201d she said. Some economists had expected the earlier Easter to boost sales, as it has done in previous years when people splash out on seasonal foods and gifts. But the BRC report noted the opposite effect, with pressure on food sales from stores closing on Easter Sunday. There was also an impact on clothes from the Easter timing as well as the poor weather, the report said. David McCorquodale, head of retail at KPMG, the report\u2019s co-authors, said: \u201cEarlier Easters are not always good for the fashion industry as consumers are put off purchases of lighter fashions and footwear in cooler temperatures and this was certainly the case this year. \u201cHowever, furniture and home accessories benefited from consumers taking on home improvement projects over the long weekend while the \u2018Mother\u2019s Day effect\u2019 boosted sales of jewellery and watches.\u201d Consumer spending has been the main driver of economic growth in the UK in recent months and the March sales lull will add to worries the UK economy is losing steam. Other reports have pointed to a drop in business and consumer confidence in the UK in the face of a global economic slowdown and a closely fought referendum on EU membership in June.",

    "webTitle": "UK ready to part-nationalise Tata Steel, says Sajid Javid", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Sajid Javid has indicated that the government is ready to part-nationalise Tata Steel\u2019s UK business in order to save thousands of jobs. The business secretary told the Commons that the government is looking at the possibility of \u201cco-investing\u201d on commercial terms with a buyer of Tata\u2019s UK business. The comments raise the prospect of the government taking an equity stake in the steel business, despite previously ruling out a nationalisation of the sites, which include the Port Talbot steelworks in Wales. Javid said his comments showed the government \u201creally will look at all options\u201d and is a \u201cdemonstration of how far the government can go\u201d to support the Port Talbot steelworks and the rest of the business. However he declined to clarify exactly what \u201cco-investing\u201d meant. An emergency debate on the steel crisis will be held in the Commons on Tuesday. MPs will have up to three hours to discuss the crisis in further detail after shadow business secretary Angela Eagle secured an urgent slot in the chamber. Javid made the comments as Tata pledged to court \u201cmany tens\u201d of potential buyers and Greybull, an investment firm, agreed to buy the Indian company\u2019s long products division for \u00a31, saving more than 4,000 jobs and a steelworks in Scunthorpe. More than 40,000 jobs are at risk after Tata announced last month that it will sell its UK business, which is losing at least \u00a31m a day. The official sale process started on Monday, with Tata hiring KPMG as advisers and the government appointing EY. The interested parties include Liberty House, run by metals tycoon Sanjeev Gupta; Greybull; German company ThyssenKrupp; and the management team at Tata Steel, who will welcome the government\u2019s suggestion it could co-invest with a buyer as they will need substantial financial backing. Koushik Chatterjee, group executive director of Tata Steel, said the company will run a \u201ccredible but expedited process\u201d to find a buyer and declined to set a deadline. He told a media briefing: \u201cThere has been a lot of people who have expressed interest, and we are aware of some of the interest that you refer to in the media. But today is a good time where our advisers will now start reaching out, and it is not a few people. I don\u2019t want to give a number, but it is in tens, many tens actually.\u201d Chatterjee also said that Tata does not want to break up its UK business. \u201cOur current proposition is to sell 100% of the equity ownership in Tata Steel UK,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen we approach the buyers we are approaching the buyers with this premise \u2013 that what is on offer is 100% equity of Tata Steel UK. If somebody comes back with a specific plant or a site or part of the business, that is our call at that point of time, depending on what the other interests are.\u201d He warned that the steel industry is facing \u201cone of its worst existential crises in the last 50 years\u201d but that a new buyer could reinvigorate the business. \u201cA new investor who hasn\u2019t suffered the legacy costs that we have suffered, for example impairments and so on, may have a fresh mind to put in capital and make the business more viable and sustainable,\u201d he said. Chatterjee declined to criticise the British government for its handling of the crisis and also played down concerns that the company\u2019s pension liabilities of almost \u00a315bn could scupper any deal. \u201cThe trustees and investment committee run that pension scheme with a lot of prudence and in a conservative manner,\u201d he said. \u201cTherefore as of today the pension scheme is in a good position. So I think it is premature to talk about anything relating to that scheme at this point in time.\u201d The hopes of securing a rescue deal improved further after Javid\u2019s suggestion that the government will go further than previously thought to protect Britain\u2019s steel industry. \u201cI\u2019ve been in contact with potential buyers making clear that the government stands ready to help. This includes looking at the possibility of co-investing with a buyer on commercial terms,\u201d he said. The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills declined to clarify whether Javid meant the business could be part-nationalised or whether co-investing includes offering a loan to a buyer. Javid said the government was not ruling anything out, but that his preferred option was the sale of Tata\u2019s entire UK business to a private buyer. One interested party could be Greybull, after its agreement to buy Tata\u2019s long products business, which makes rails for train tracks and runs a major steelworks in Scunthorpe and has other sites in Teesside, Workington, York and northern France. Marc Meyohas, partner at Greybull, said the \u201centire focus\u201d of the organisation was completing the deal to buy the Scunthorpe site, which is subject to regulatory approval and securing a financing package worth \u00a3400m. However, he declined to rule out a bid for the rest of Tata Steel UK. Meyohas said: \u201cOnce we cross that hurdle, shareholders of any business will be looking to grow and looking at opportunities.\u201d He insisted that the long products business and the Scunthorpe site have an \u201cexciting future\u201d despite the pressure on the steel industry. The business will be renamed British Steel. Meyohas said the \u201ckey ingredients\u201d of the site were the world class workforce, loyal customers and its established footprint. \u201cWe all believe the future will do justice the heritage [of the brand],\u201d he said. Greybull believes it can make the business profitable within a year and claimed it even recorded a profit in March by one measure. The \u00a3400m funding package will be used to fund operations and modernise its sites. Half of the package will come from Greybull shareholders, with the other half from a consortium of banks and potentially the government. \u201cWe know [the government] are keen to help and we will continue the discussions to make sure we get as much support as possible,\u201d Meyohas added. Greybull\u2019s previous investments include rescuing Monarch, the low-cost airline, and backing a private equity takeover of Comet, the electricals retailer, which collapsed into administration just months later. When asked why Greybull was the right owner of the business, Meyohas said: \u201cWe hope to be judged by our actions.\u201d Employees are being asked to accept a 3% pay cut and changes to their pension scheme but trade unions welcomed the deal. Martin Foster, Unite convenor at the Scunthorpe site, said: \u201cThis announcement is good news and brings us within touching distance of securing a future for steelmaking in Scunthorpe.\u201d",

If somebody comes back with a specific plant or a site or part of the business, that is our call at that point of time, depending on what the other interests are.\u201d</p> <p>He warned that the steel industry is facing \u201cone of its worst existential crises in the last 50 years\u201d but that a new buyer could reinvigorate the business. \u201cA new investor who hasn\u2019t suffered the legacy costs that we have suffered, for example impairments and so on, may have a fresh mind to put in capital and make the business more viable and sustainable,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Chatterjee declined to criticise the British government for its handling of the crisis and also played down concerns that the company\u2019s pension liabilities of almost \u00a315bn could scupper any deal.</p> <p>\u201cThe trustees and investment committee run that pension scheme with a lot of prudence and in a conservative manner,\u201d he said. \u201cTherefore as of today the pension scheme is in a good position. So I think it is premature to talk about anything relating to that scheme at this point in time.\u201d<br></p> <p>The hopes of securing a rescue deal improved further after Javid\u2019s suggestion that the government will go further than previously thought to protect Britain\u2019s steel industry.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been in contact with potential buyers making clear that the government stands ready to help. This includes looking at the possibility of co-investing with a buyer on commercial terms,\u201d he said.<br></p> <p>The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills declined to clarify whether Javid meant the business could be part-nationalised or whether co-investing includes offering a loan to a buyer. Javid said the government was not ruling anything out, but that his preferred option was the sale of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/06/rescue-tata-uk-port-talbot-steel-operations\">Tata\u2019s entire UK business to a private buyer</a>. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/06/rescue-tata-uk-port-talbot-steel-operations\">Who might rescue Port Talbot?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>One interested party could be Greybull, after its agreement to buy Tata\u2019s long products business, which makes rails for train tracks and runs a major steelworks in Scunthorpe and has other sites in Teesside, Workington, York and northern France.</p> <p>Marc Meyohas, partner at Greybull, said the \u201centire focus\u201d of the organisation was completing the deal to buy the Scunthorpe site, which is subject to regulatory approval and securing a financing package worth \u00a3400m. However, he declined to rule out a bid for the rest of Tata Steel UK.</p> <p>Meyohas said: \u201cOnce we cross that hurdle, shareholders of any business will be looking to grow and looking at opportunities.\u201d He insisted that the long products business and the Scunthorpe site have an \u201cexciting future\u201d despite the pressure on the steel industry. The business will be renamed British Steel.</p> <p>Meyohas said the \u201ckey ingredients\u201d of the site were the world class workforce, loyal customers and its established footprint. \u201cWe all believe the future will do justice the heritage [of the brand],\u201d he said. Greybull believes it can make the business profitable within a year and claimed it even recorded a profit in March by one measure.</p> <p>The \u00a3400m funding package will be used to fund operations and modernise its sites. Half of the package will come from Greybull shareholders, with the other half from a consortium of banks and potentially the government. </p> <p>\u201cWe know [the government] are keen to help and we will continue the discussions to make sure we get as much support as possible,\u201d Meyohas added.</p> <p>Greybull\u2019s previous investments include <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/06/rescue-tata-uk-port-talbot-steel-operations\">rescuing Monarch,</a> the low-cost airline, and backing a private equity takeover of Comet, the electricals retailer, which collapsed into administration just months later.</p> <p>When asked why Greybull was the right owner of the business, Meyohas said: \u201cWe hope to be judged by our actions.\u201d</p> <p>Employees are being asked to accept a 3% pay cut and changes to their pension scheme but trade unions welcomed the deal. Martin Foster, Unite convenor at the Scunthorpe site, said: \u201cThis announcement is good news and brings us within touching distance of securing a future for steelmaking in Scunthorpe.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "The deal that has resulted in Tata offloading part of its troubled UK steel business to Greybull Capital has been credited with saving jobs, although the private equity firm\u2019s record after taking over other struggling companies may not leave its new employees entirely reassured. The single-page website of Greybull Capital LLP, headquartered in Knightsbridge, central London, gives little away, but its directors insist that they are \u201clong-term investors\u201d and that the reputation it acquired \u2013 after the collapse of the electrical goods retailer Comet \u2013 as a secretive firm looking for a kill is misplaced. Greybull was founded in 2008 by Nathaniel and Marc Meyohas, the wealthy French-born brothers, along with family friend Richard Perlhagen \u2013 a former Lehman Brothers banker, like Nathaniel \u2013 to invest the family fortune. All three are now UK residents and were joined at Greybull by a fourth partner, Daniel Goldstein. The company first came to public prominence as investors in OpCapita\u2019s controversial takeover of Comet in 2011, shortly before it went into administration, which led to accusations that Greybull profited while thousands lost their jobs and other creditors lost millions. The reference still rankles with Marc Mehoyas, who told the Guardian on Monday: \u201cWe were not involved as a significant shareholder \u2013 but someone released our names as the main backers. That was far from the truth.\u201d A happier investment has been the \u00a375m Greybull put into Monarch, helping to secure the UK\u2019s oldest surviving airline brand \u2013 although pilots and crew were forced to accept a rescue deal that included pay cuts of 30%, reductions to pilots\u2019 pensions and 700 redundancies. The airline\u2019s fleet was reduced and its route network pared back to the most lucrative destinations as Monarch returned to profit, making \u00a340m in 2015, aided by tumbling oil prices. After 17 months, Greybull was reported to be considering a sale of Monarch at a large profit. However, Meyohas insisted: \u201cThere\u2019s no sale process going on. The turnaround has been good \u2013 we don\u2019t have any exit plans. Deutsche Bank has presented us with M&amp;A [mergers and acquisitions] growth opportunities. That story got translated and spiralled.\u201d Since 2014, the contact details of representatives at PR firm Bell Pottinger have been found on Greybull\u2019s website. Meyohas said this reflects the more high-profile investments that Greybull is now making, but added: \u201cWe make no bones about the fact we are a family office, so we don\u2019t need to shout off the rooftops about what we do.\u201d He said \u201csome of the lingo\u201d used to describe Greybull was wrong and that the firm did not seek publicity as it was not a private equity fund looking to raise money. \u201cWe\u2019re professional people, we\u2019re not looking for stardom, just trying to help the companies and help them grow,\u201d he said. For the rescued Tata division, to be renamed British Steel, Meyohas said: \u201cWhat we bring to the table is a period of stable ownership for the business, capital, and committed investors to growth.\u201d As well as the \u00a3400m investment package, he said Greybull had \u201csome expertise in turnaround and helping firms through choppy waters\u201d. Meyohas said they would expect Greybull to retain its steel interest until 2026 at the minimum. \u201cThat\u2019s the basis on which we invest \u2013 if in 10 years or more we\u2019d still be happy with being shareholders.\u201d Although Perlhagen qualified that the period could be less than 10 years if a buyer or a merger opportunity came along, Meyohas said: \u201cIn our world, we\u2019re not into exit plans. We\u2019re buying it because we think it\u2019s a viable long-term business. \u201cWe are believers in the plan, and the people, and the fact is that while [steel] is pretty battered and a sector that is getting a lot of negative publicity, we think it\u2019s a plan worth backing.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s a cause to inflame Eurosceptic passions: save our public-spirited regulators from the tyranny of judgments made by bureaucratic overlords in Brussels. Well, OK, the furious debate over Three-owner CK Hutchison\u2019s attempt to buy O2 hasn\u2019t reached that stage yet. In fact, Alex Chisholm, chief executive of the UK Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), went out of his way to praise the \u201ctimely, productive and meaningful interactions\u201d his team has enjoyed with the European commission, which will decide whether the \u00a310bn merger can proceed. However, Chisholm was clear on what he would like commissioner Margrethe Vestager to conclude. He wants the deal blocked to prevent \u201clong-term damage\u201d to the UK mobile telecoms market. More technically, he wants the remedies to be so severe that the economic logic of the deal would collapse. Only the creation of a commercially viable fourth mobile operator would suffice, thinks the CMA. Chisholm, oddly, skipped over the detail of the supporting arguments. Never mind, though, because telecoms regulator Ofcom has already supplied them. For months now, Ofcom boss Sharon White has been warning that a Three/O2 combo could leave consumers poorer by reducing the number of UK mobile operators from four to three. Prices have risen in other European countries where four-to-three deals have happened, Ofcom has argued on the basis of detailed data. What\u2019s more, there is little evidence that better infrastructure \u2013 the prize deal-doers invariably wave \u2013 has materialised. Further, mobile companies have maintained healthy cashflow margins above 12% in the UK even while rolling out 4G technology. Hutchison, naturally, snorts with resentment at the twin-pronged regulatory assault. The CMA\u2019s letter \u201ccan have no legitimate status in the merger control process\u201d, it says, sticking to its argument that side-deals to rent network capacity to Sky, Virgin, Tesco and others will ensure healthy competition. In practice, however, Hutchison must suspect the game is almost up. Vestager would walk into a political storm if she imposes a deal on the UK that is bitterly opposed by local regulators. At a stroke, she would undermine the credibility of telecoms regulation in the UK. If the commission does indeed say no in coming weeks (the deadline for a decision is 19 May), we should cheer. Whatever the niceties of single market regulation, Ofcom and the CMA are surely better placed than the commission to judge what is good for competition and consumers in the UK. Brussels should do its legal duty to review the case on its merits. Then it should decide the answer is: no deal. Big pay at BP BP\u2019s shareholders \u2013 or a few of them, at least \u2013 intend to revolt over chief executive Bob Dudley\u2019s $19.6m (\u00a313.7m) pay packet in a loss-making year. Their mood may not be improved by the company\u2019s literal-minded defence. The measures that determine executives\u2019 rewards, says BP, \u201cderive directly from BP\u2019s remuneration policy which was approved by shareholders at the 2014 AGM [annual general meeting] with over 96% of the vote.\u201d Put another way, the owners only have themselves to blame. From a purely mechanistic point of view, BP has a point. The oil company has tried to strip out factors beyond current executives\u2019 control \u2013 like the oil price and the financial fall-out from the Deepwater Horizon disaster in 2010 \u2013 and focus on factors they can affect. BP, investors are told, did splendidly on safety, cashflow and delivery of big projects. That is why Dudley\u2019s annual bonus, for example, was hiked by 38%. Yet this explanation is far too breezy. BP\u2019s pay committee seems to have forgotten that it is allowed to apply common sense if the pay formula spits out a number that is plainly inflammatory. For 2015, there were several reasons to hit the overide button. First, profits fell by 50% even when the latest hit from Deepwater Horizon is ignored. Second, BP imposed a pay freeze on all staff in 2015 and is cutting 7,000 jobs. Those cost-saving actions would be swallowed more easily if the boss was also seen to be buckling down for an era of oil at sub-$50 a barrel instead of continuing to enjoy rewards worth 125 times average pay at BP. The level of revolt at Thurday\u2019s annual meeting probably won\u2019t match the 40% recorded back in 2009. But, as then, the company has shown itself to be tone deaf to the mood outside the boardroom. Smart move on British Steel Good luck to Greybull Capital in its purchase of Tata Steel\u2019s UK long products business, a deal that could protect up to 4,400 jobs in Scunthorpe, Teesside and elsewhere. The Greybull crew have also bought the rights to the British Steel name, dormant since 1999, and intend to use it. Smart move: if you\u2019re looking to the government for financial support to help revive operations, requests may be harder to refuse if they are seen to come from British Steel rather than a family investment office.",

What\u2019s more, there is little evidence that better infrastructure \u2013 the prize deal-doers invariably wave \u2013 has materialised. Further, mobile companies have maintained healthy cashflow margins above 12% in the UK even while rolling out 4G technology.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/11/uk-regulator-wants-european-commission-to-block-three-o2-deal\">UK regulator wants European commission to block Three/O2 deal</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Hutchison, naturally, snorts with resentment at the twin-pronged regulatory assault. The CMA\u2019s letter \u201ccan have no legitimate status in the merger control process\u201d, it says, sticking to its argument that side-deals to rent network capacity to Sky, Virgin, Tesco and others will ensure healthy competition.</p> <p>In practice, however, Hutchison must suspect the game is almost up. Vestager would walk into a political storm if she imposes a deal on the UK that is bitterly opposed by local regulators. At a stroke, she would undermine the credibility of telecoms regulation in the UK.</p> <p>If the commission does indeed say no in coming weeks (the deadline for a decision is 19 May), we should cheer. Whatever the niceties of single market regulation, Ofcom and the CMA are surely better placed than the commission to judge what is good for competition and consumers in the UK. Brussels should do its legal duty to review the case on its merits. Then it should decide the answer is: no deal.</p> <h2>Big pay at BP</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/11/vote-against-bp-chief-bob-dudley-pay-shareholder-group-says\">BP\u2019s shareholders \u2013 or a few of them, at least \u2013 intend to revolt </a>over chief executive Bob Dudley\u2019s $19.6m (\u00a313.7m) pay packet <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/31/bp-to-announce-70-collapse-in-profits\">in a loss-making year</a>. Their mood may not be improved by the company\u2019s literal-minded defence. The measures that determine executives\u2019 rewards, says BP, \u201cderive directly from BP\u2019s remuneration policy which was approved by shareholders at the 2014 AGM [annual general meeting] with over 96% of the vote.\u201d Put another way, the owners only have themselves to blame.<br></p> <p>From a purely mechanistic point of view, BP has a point. The oil company has tried to strip out factors beyond current executives\u2019 control \u2013 like the oil price and the financial fall-out from the Deepwater Horizon disaster in 2010 \u2013 and focus on factors they can affect. BP, investors are told, did splendidly on safety, cashflow and delivery of big projects. That is why Dudley\u2019s annual bonus, for example, was hiked by 38%.</p> <p>Yet this explanation is far too breezy. BP\u2019s pay committee seems to have forgotten that it is allowed to apply common sense if the pay formula spits out a number that is plainly inflammatory.</p> <p>For 2015, there were several reasons to hit the overide button. First, profits fell by 50% even when the latest hit from Deepwater Horizon is ignored. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/02/bp-annual-loss-biggest-for-20-years-axes-thousands-of-jobs-deepwater\">Second, BP imposed a pay freeze on all staff in 2015 and is cutting 7,000 jobs. </a>Those cost-saving actions would be swallowed more easily if the boss was also seen to be buckling down for an era of oil at sub-$50 a barrel instead of continuing to enjoy rewards worth 125 times average pay at BP.</p> <p>The level of revolt at Thurday\u2019s annual meeting probably won\u2019t match the 40% <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/apr/16/bp-executive-pay-rebellion\">recorded back in 2009</a>. But, as then, the company has shown itself to be tone deaf to the mood outside the boardroom.</p> <h2>Smart move on British Steel</h2> <p>Good luck to Greybull Capital in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/11/tata-steel-deal-saves-4400-uk-jobs\">its purchase of Tata Steel\u2019s UK long products business</a>, a deal that could protect up to 4,400 jobs in Scunthorpe, Teesside and elsewhere. The Greybull crew have also bought the rights to the British Steel name, dormant since 1999, and intend to use it. Smart move: if you\u2019re looking to the government for financial support to help revive operations, requests may be harder to refuse if they are seen to come from British Steel rather than a family investment office.<br></p>",

    "webTitle": "UK regulator wants European commission to block Three-O2 deal", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s competition regulator has called on the European commission to block the owner of Three\u2019s \u00a310.25bn acquisition of O2, or force the combined mobile phone operator to break itself up to protect consumers. Hutchison Whampoa, the Hong Kong conglomerate that owns Three, agreed in March 2015 to buy O2 from Telef\u00f3nica of Spain. The deal would create Britain\u2019s biggest mobile phone company and reduce the number of UK network owners from four to three: Hutchison, BT and Vodafone. In October, the UK\u2019s Competition and Markets Authority asked the commission to refer the acquisition to it but in December the commission turned down the request, saying it was better qualified to apply European rules. The CMA had argued that fewer mobile operators would lead to higher prices or worse service for British consumers. The commission acknowledged this was possible but said it would impose measures to protect consumers. The CMA has seen the proposals but they have not been made public. Alex Chisholm, the CMA\u2019s chief executive, has written to the commissioner, Margrethe Vestager, saying the commission\u2019s proposed actions are inadequate. The letter was partly triggered by Vestager saying last week that the decision was due soon, although the deadline is not until 19 May. Chisholm said: \u201cIt is clear that the remedies offered fall well short of what would be required to meet the relevant legal standard, as detailed in our case submissions. The proposed remedies are materially deficient as they will not lead to the creation of a fourth mobile network operator (MNO) capable of competing effectively and in the long-term with the remaining three MNOs such that it would stem the loss of competition caused by the merger.\u201d He said the combined company should be forced to sell either Three or O2 to an approved buyer or the deal, which would transform Hutchison from the smallest operator, should be scrapped. Hutchison has offered to freeze prices for five years, invest \u00a35bn to improve coverage and reliability and share some of the merged network with rival operators such as Sky, Virgin and Tesco. Hutchison said the CMA\u2019s letter had no legitimacy in the decision-making process and that its deals to give access to rival operators would open up competition. The proposed forced sale of Three or O2 is a \u201cred herring\u201d because there is no buyer and it would undermine the reason for the takeover, Hutchison said. \u201cIt is no surprise that CMA opposes the merger. It always has,\u201d Hutchison said. \u201cIt is an entirely one-sided argument designed to support a preordained outcome.\u201d A spokeswoman for Vestager said the commission had received the letter and that its investigation was continuing. Chisholm\u2019s letter reinforces the UK authorities\u2019 unhappiness about the takeover, which would give Hutchison, owned by Hong Kong\u2019s richest man, Li Ka-shing, about 40% of UK mobile phone users with more than 30 million customers. Sharon White, the chief executive of the communications regulator Ofcom, wrote to the commission earlier this year arguing the deal could mean higher prices, reduced competition between network providers and the big operators having too much power over independent retailers. The commission\u2019s deadline for ruling on the takeover is a month before the 23 June referendum on Britain\u2019s EU membership, drawing the tussle between Britain\u2019s competition watchdog and Vestager\u2019s department into the debate over the UK\u2019s place in Europe. Matthew Elliott, chief executive of the Vote Leave campaign, said: \u201cDecisions about how we regulate UK businesses should be taken by UK authorities accountable to UK consumers and electors. If not there is a danger decisions, or a lack of them, could lead to higher prices for customers and put British jobs at risk. \u201cIt is extraordinary that we are powerless over decisions that that will have a major impact on millions of people\u2019s phone bills.\u201d Hutchison and Telef\u00f3nica announced the takeover of O2 after BT unveiled its \u00a312.5bn acquisition of EE to return to the mobile phone market. The CMA allowed the BT/EE deal through without conditions because there was minimal overlap between the businesses. It left operators jostling for position in a complex system of overlapping alliances and rivalries. Vodafone, which shares the Beacon network with O2, said Hutchison buying its partner would be harmful because the UK needs at least three credible network operators for effective competition. \u201cVodafone UK relies on the Beacon network that we share with O2 to roll out our 4G network. That roll-out is accelerating and both Vodafone and O2 have clear incentives to develop the network. You can\u2019t leave the smallest operator on its own or with an uncommitted partner, especially in a three-player market.\u201d Vodafone said Hutchison was running out of time to negotiate a deal with the commission and that it believed Vestager would have to block the acquisition. Figures for 2014, the most recent available, showed EE had 29% of UK mobile phone contracts, followed by Telef\u00f3nica with 26% and Vodafone with 19%. Three had 10% of the market followed by Virgin Media with 4% and the remaining 12% shared between smaller companies.

      "body": "<p>Britain\u2019s competition regulator has called on the European commission to block the owner of Three\u2019s \u00a310.25bn acquisition of O2, or force the combined mobile phone operator to break itself up to protect consumers.</p> <p>Hutchison Whampoa, the Hong Kong conglomerate that owns Three, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jan/23/mobile-network-three-to-buy-o2\">agreed in March 2015 to buy O2 from Telef\u00f3nica</a> of Spain. The deal would create Britain\u2019s biggest mobile phone company and reduce the number of UK network owners from four to three: Hutchison, BT and Vodafone.</p> <p>In October, the UK\u2019s Competition and Markets Authority asked the commission to refer the acquisition to it but in December the commission turned down the request, saying it was better qualified to apply European rules. </p> <p>The CMA had argued that fewer mobile operators would lead to higher prices or worse service for British consumers. The commission acknowledged this was possible but said it would impose measures to protect consumers. The CMA has seen the proposals but they have not been made public.</p> <p>Alex Chisholm, the CMA\u2019s chief executive, <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/515405/CMA_letter_to_Commissioner_Margrethe_Vestager.pdf\">has written to the commissioner</a>, Margrethe Vestager, saying the commission\u2019s proposed actions are inadequate. The letter was partly triggered by Vestager saying last week that the decision was due soon, although the deadline is not until 19 May.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/apr/2016-04-11T17:30:57.html\" data-alt=\"UK mobile phone market share\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/apr/2016-04-11T17:30:57.html\">UK mobile phone market share</a> </figure>  <p>Chisholm said: \u201cIt is clear that the remedies offered fall well short of what would be required to meet the relevant legal standard, as detailed in our case submissions. The proposed remedies are materially deficient as they will not lead to the creation of a fourth mobile network operator (MNO) capable of competing effectively and in the long-term with the remaining three MNOs such that it would stem the loss of competition caused by the merger.\u201d</p> <p>He said the combined company should be forced to sell either Three or O2 to an approved buyer or the deal, which would transform Hutchison from the smallest operator, should be scrapped. Hutchison has offered to freeze prices for five years, invest \u00a35bn to improve coverage and reliability and share some of the merged network with rival operators such as Sky, Virgin and Tesco.</p> <p>Hutchison said the CMA\u2019s letter had no legitimacy in the decision-making process and that its deals to give access to rival operators would open up competition. The proposed forced sale of Three or O2 is a \u201cred herring\u201d because there is no buyer and it would undermine the reason for the takeover, Hutchison said.</p> <p>\u201cIt is no surprise that CMA opposes the merger. It always has,\u201d Hutchison said. \u201cIt is an entirely one-sided argument designed to support a preordained outcome.\u201d</p> <p>A spokeswoman for Vestager said the commission had received the letter and that its investigation was continuing.<br></p> <p>Chisholm\u2019s letter reinforces the UK authorities\u2019 unhappiness about the takeover, which would give Hutchison, owned by Hong Kong\u2019s richest man, Li Ka-shing, about 40% of UK mobile phone users with more than 30 million customers. </p> <p>Sharon White, the chief executive of the communications regulator Ofcom, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/01/ofcom-chief-warns-on-o2-and-three-merger\">wrote to the commission</a> earlier this year arguing the deal could mean higher prices, reduced competition between network providers and the big operators having too much power over independent retailers.</p> <p>The commission\u2019s deadline for ruling on the takeover is a month before the 23 June referendum on Britain\u2019s EU membership, drawing the tussle between Britain\u2019s competition watchdog and Vestager\u2019s department into the debate over the UK\u2019s place in Europe.<br></p> <p>Matthew Elliott, chief executive of the Vote Leave campaign, said: \u201cDecisions about how we regulate UK businesses should be taken by UK authorities accountable to UK consumers and electors. If not there is a danger decisions, or a lack of them, could lead to higher prices for customers and put British jobs at risk. </p> <p>\u201cIt is extraordinary that we are powerless over decisions that that will have a major impact on millions of people\u2019s phone bills.\u201d</p> <p>Hutchison and Telef\u00f3nica announced the takeover of O2 after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/feb/05/bt-to-buy-ee-4g-broadband\">BT unveiled its \u00a312.5bn acquisition of EE</a> to return to the mobile phone market. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/28/bt-takeover-of-ee-given-provisional-clearance-by-competition-watchdog\">CMA allowed the BT/EE deal through </a>without conditions because there was minimal overlap between the businesses. It left operators jostling for position in a complex system of overlapping alliances and rivalries.</p> <p>Vodafone, which shares the Beacon network with O2, said Hutchison buying its partner would be harmful because the UK needs at least three credible network operators for effective competition. <br></p> <p>\u201cVodafone UK relies on the Beacon network that we share with O2 to roll out our 4G network.

      "bodyText": "Housebuilder Persimmon could face protests over executive pay and the composition of its boardroom at this week\u2019s annual general meeting. Investor bodies have issued a warning over a share scheme set up in 2012 which could hand out an estimated \u00a3600m to 150 directors by 2022. Some are also unhappy over the appointment of Nigel Mills as a non-executive director, questioning his independence because he is connected to the builders\u2019 financial advisers, Citi. Persimmon holds its AGM on Thursday, one of the first of the annual meeting season. It comes on the same day as those of miner Rio Tinto and oil company BP, which is also facing some opposition to its pay schemes. While pay can often cause controversy at AGMs, this year companies may also face scrutiny about pledges made on climate change and any impact of the UK\u2019s possible exit from the EU. Advisory bodies have raised several areas of concern about Persimmon to shareholders. One, Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS), has advised voting against the election of Mills to the Persimmon board because of his connections to Citi. This means he is not seen as independent by ISS, which also notes that Mills sits on the remuneration committee, which is meant to be entirely staffed by independent directors. The Institutional Voting Information Service (Ivis) \u2013 which provides corporate governance research to investors \u2013 has also highlighted the relationship between Mills and Citi. Ivis does not give advice on how to vote but has issued an amber alert, its second highest level of warning, to raise corporate governance concerns. Mills\u2019s appointment to the board was announced in January alongside a series of other changes including the departures of non-executive directors Richard Pennycook, chief executive of the Co-operative Group, and Mark Preston, of Grosvenor estates. Manifest, another advisory body, drew investors\u2019 attention to the structure of the share bonus scheme. Another leading advisory service, Glass Lewis, also recommended voting against the remuneration report. A Persimmon official said the long-term incentive plan had been approved in 2012. \u201cThis is a long-term plan that runs for almost a decade, which is designed to drive outperformance through the housing cycle and to incentivise the management to deliver the capital return, grow the business and increase the share price. Unlike many other schemes, it extends to around 150 executives.\u201d ISS does not recommend voting against the remuneration report, but Glass Lewis has advised a no vote because of the structure of the scheme, which is based on the premise that 620p per share \u2013 a total of \u00a31.9bn \u2013 will be returned to shareholders by the end of 2021. The company has since increased its target to 900p per share but has not adjusted the basis upon which the scheme pays out to executives. On the appointment of Mills to the board, Glass Lewis has been assured that the senior advisor at Citi has not worked on Persimmon business for three years so it would classify him as independent. However, it will monitor the situation. ShareAction, a charity that promotes responsible investment, intends to use the AGM as an opportunity to encourage the company to consider living wage accreditation. In February, when Persimmon announced the higher payout target of 900p a share, it had declared it had achieved an \u201coutstanding performance\u201d with a 34% rise in profits (before a goodwill impairment) to \u00a3638m. A shortage of new homes and schemes to encourage house buying have helped housebuilders such as Persimmon \u2013 although its shares, and those of its rivals, were among the biggest fallers in the FTSE 100 on Monday amid concerns of a slowdown in the economy.",

      "bodyText": "The UK government could \u201cco-invest\u201d alongside any potential buyer for the Port Talbot steelworks, the business secretary, Sajid Javid, has said. Javid\u2019s comments to MPs in the House of Commons on Monday afternoon are the first firm indication that the government could pump taxpayer money into Port Talbot, having previously all but ruled out any form of nationalisation. The business minister said the government was considering \u201cco-investing with a buyer on commercial terms\u201d to help save the plant, which employs 4,000 people. He added that Port Talbot\u2019s owner Tata Steel had been \u201cseriously considering a complete closure\u201d until the government intervened to convince the firm to hold out for a buyer. However, Javid\u2019s opposite number, Labour\u2019s Angela Eagle, said the government had \u201cbeen found wanting\u201d, adding that Tata\u2019s decision to wait for a buyer was not down to Javid but \u201cthe hard work of the steel unions and the plant management\u201d. She also urged Javid to do more to help British steelmakers, such as ensuring that government contracts to buy steel are given to UK firms. Javid said Eagle\u2019s comments amounted to \u201ccheap political shots\u201d, adding that the government was taking action to help the steel industry, including exemptions on green taxes. \u201cLet me be clear, we haven\u2019t ruled anything out,\u201d said Javid, before adding that \u201cnationalisation is rarely the answer\u201d. He said the government\u2019s role was more likely to involve intervention on \u201cpower supply, pensions and other areas such as infrastructure\u201d. Asked to clarify what he meant by \u201cco-invest\u201d, Javid said: \u201cI\u2019ve said that to demonstrate that when we say we will look at all the options, we really will look at all options. \u201cIt\u2019s possible someone might come forward and ask for funds from government in lots of different ways. \u201cIt has to be on commercial terms.\u201d Roy Rickhuss, general secretary of steelworkers\u2019 union Community, said Javid\u2019s comments sent \u201cthe right signal to potential investors\u201d but said the business minister should explain what he meant. \u201cMr Javid should bring forward further details of what \u2018co-investment\u2019 would look like and share his plans with the unions so we can ensure that the best interests of steelworkers are upheld,\u201d he said.",

    "webTitle": "Markets lifted by oil and Italian banks despite growth fears - as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "European markets have started the week on a positive note, lifted by rising oil prices and a positive performance from banking shares. Hopes of a positive outcome from the Doha meeting of oil producers this month lifted Brent crude by more than 2% to $42.86 a barrel, benefiting commodity companies. Meanwhile Italian banks gained ground, with investors optimistic about a plan to set up a fund to take over bad loans, which pulled the whole sector higher. There was also a boost from Wall Street, which headed higher in early trading ahead of the start of the latest reporting season. But in London the FTSE 100 slipped back as housebuilding shares fell on worries about the general economic situation, the threat of Brexit and signs of a slowdown at the top end of the market. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 4.29 points or 0.07% at 6200.12 Germany\u2019s Dax added 0.63% to 9682.99 France\u2019s Cac closed up 0.22% at 4312.63 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIBrose 1.25% to 17,722.66 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 0.83% better at 8497.6 In Greece, the Athens market edged 0.11% lower at 560.97 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 71 points or 0.4%. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Italian banks continue to move higher on hope that a state-backed fund to buy bad loans will soon be set up. Troubled Monte dei Paschi is up around 9% while Unicredit and Intesa Sanpaolo, the country\u2019s two biggest banks, are both up around 2%. Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets, said: A meeting of Italian banks, the Bank of Italy and government agencies ahead of the creation of a rescue fund lifted banking shares across Europe. If the fund can bring in outside investors as stakeholders and even issue its own bonds then it\u2019s chances of success will be greater than the kind of government bailouts that have failed to turn things around so far. Speaking of helicopter money, Reuters is reporting that the European Central Bank is attempting to soothe ruffled feathers - particularly in Germany - after it suggested last month that the idea of giving money directly to citizens was an interesting idea: Almost a month after stoking a divisive debate about how far it should go in pumping money into the flagging euro zone economy, the European Central Bank is trying to soothe relations with Germany after unusually strong criticism from Berlin. Late last week, German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble was reported as blaming the ECB\u2019s cheap-money policy in part for the rise of the country\u2019s right-wing anti-immigration Alternative for Germany (AfD). The discussion is likely to continue when ECB President Mario Draghi meets Schaeuble this week in Washington at the International Monetary Fund\u2019s spring gathering of central bankers and ministers from around the world. A storm of protest erupted in thrifty Germany after Draghi last month described the idea of \u201chelicopter money\u201d - sending money directly to citizens - as a \u201cvery interesting\u201d - if unexamined - concept. Late last week, top ECB officials, including the ECB\u2019s chief economist and its vice president, backpedalled, saying the idea was not on the table. But the damage had already been done. \u201cThe ECB\u2019s policy was already unpopular in Germany and the idea of helicopter money was the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back,\u201d said Joerg Kraemer, an economist with Commerzbank in Frankfurt. \u201cPeople feel that ideas like this are dangerous.\u201d German analysts see the idea as an excessive ramping up of a loose money policy that is already fuelling rising property prices in their country, and also because it would undermine the euro by printing money and giving it away for free. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen most of the impact of QE (Quantitative Easing) last year and there is little more to come,\u201d said Lars Feld, one of the \u2018wise men\u2019 that advise the German government on economic policy. So-called helicopter money - involving central banks printing money and giving it directly to consumers in an effort to boost spending and growth - should not be ruled out entirely according to former Federal Reserve chair Ben Bernanke. In a new post he says the probability of helicopter money being used in the US in the foreseeable future is low. But it could prove a valuable tool for central banks although it poses problems with implementation. He concludes: Money-financed fiscal programs (MFFPs), known colloquially as helicopter drops, are very unlikely to be needed in the United States in the foreseeable future. They also present a number of practical challenges of implementation, including integrating them into operational monetary frameworks and assuring appropriate governance and coordination between the legislature and the central bank. However, under certain extreme circumstances\u2014sharply deficient aggregate demand, exhausted monetary policy, and unwillingness of the legislature to use debt-financed fiscal policies\u2014such programs may be the best available alternative. It would be premature to rule them out. Ahead of the latest US reporting season which begins - as always - with Alcoa, Wall Street has moved ahead in early trading. With oil prices maintaining their recent gains - Brent crude is currently up just over 1% at $42.41 a barrel - the Dow Jones Industrial Average is is up around 90 points or 0.5%. The US move has done little to support the FTSE 100, which is virtually unchanged as a rise in commodity prices is undercut by falls in housebuilders on worries about the outlook. But Germany\u2019s Dax has fared better, up more than 1%, while France\u2019s Cac has climbed nearly 0.6%. And more from our correspondent in Athens on the anti-austerity pact signed signed between the Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras and visiting Portuguese leader Antonio Costa. Helena Smith reports: True to form, Tsipras has used the occasion of his Portuguese counterpart\u2019s visit to lob a few verbal volleys at international creditors keeping debt-stricken Greece afloat. As the accord was made public, the leftist leader announced that it was the right of every \u201csovereign and democratic country\u201d to elect the means by which it would meet agreed (fiscal) targets. \u201cNo one can take away the ability and the right of a sovereign and democratic country to choose the political means to achieve agreed targets,\u201d he said. \u201cDemocracy is the last commodity that we ought, tooth and nail, to defend.\u201d Having suffered the greatest economic damage, the problem-plagued country now needed the greatest amount of time to recover, said Tsipras. Athens is in a race against-the-clock to conclude negotiations with auditors representing lenders at the EU and International Monetary Fund before talks break off for the latter\u2019s annual Spring meetings which begin in Washington DC tomorrow. \u201cThey have to be wrapped up by tomorrow,\u201d said the Greek economy minister Giorgos Stathakis. Greece has long laid the blame for the failure to complete what would be the first review of its third international bailout at the door of the IMF. Every day that the economic progress report is delayed, the real economy \u2013 already in tatters \u2013 suffers a little more with the country effectively being put on hold until it receives its next aid disbursement from creditors. Athens Live has documents from the bailout talks between Greece and its creditors suggesting the two sides are heading towards a conclusion: Back with the sale of Tata\u2019s Scunthorpe plant to Greybull, the trade association for the UK steel industry welcomed the deal but said more needed to be done to support the rest of the sector. Gareth Stace, director of UK Steel, said: This is clearly good news for the British steel sector, and I hope it will provide a much needed boost for steelmaking in the UK. However, while very welcome it does not mean that we are out of the woods yet. A long term investor is needed, in the very short term, for the remainder of the whole of the Tata Steel UK business, including Port Talbot. We must also remember that the crisis that we are in is not confined to just the Tata Steel businesses, but the sector as a whole. In order to help make the Long Products Europe business a success, as well as the steel companies across the UK, we still need government to pull all levers, push all buttons and take every action possible to ensure British steel can once again complete on the global market place. This includes pushing the European Commission to continue its steel dumping investigations ensuring that tariffs are set at an appropriate level. We would also like to see more Government action to bridge the gap on electricity cost with competitors, business rates and to provide direct financial assistance to steel companies to further improve both energy efficiency and also productivity, are all measures that will help our sector fairly compete. We need to remember that the intention to sell the Long Products Division was announced two years ago, which demonstrates that these complex deals take time and therefore requires patience on all sides, to see them through to a successful conclusion. Government must be prepared to provide time limited, life support to our sector. Without this, the future of steelmaking in Britain could be limited. All very friendly as Portugal\u2019s prime minister Antonio Costa shakes hands with Greece\u2019s Alexis Tsipras on a visit to Athens. Back with the Greybull deal to buy Tata\u2019s Scunthorpe operations, and the Unite union has called for the government to act to allow the business to operate on a level playing field with competitors. Unite convenor for Tata Steel Scunthorpe Martin Foster said: This announcement is good news and brings us within touching distance of securing a future for steelmaking in Scunthorpe. It should not be forgotten though that many workers have already lost their jobs at Scunthorpe and those that remain are making huge sacrifices with their pay and pensions to secure their jobs. Unite is asking our members to back the deal, but government ministers must now play their part too. The government cannot now leave Scunthorpe\u2019s steelworkers high and dry and must take decisive action to allow them to compete on an even playing field with their global competitors. This means supporting steelworkers by ensuring infrastructure such as HS2 and defence projects are built with British steel, as well as tackling the dumping of cheap imports and high energy costs, which is leaving steelworkers fighting with one hand tied behind their backs. Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras has just signed an anti-austerity pact with visiting Portuguese leader Antonio Costa: The Economist Intelligence Unit is casting some doubts on plans to restructure Italy\u2019s banking system: German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble and European Central Bank president Mario Draghi will talk this week in Washington at the IMF meeting. That is according to a spokesman for the German finance ministry. It should be an interesting talk after Sch\u00e4uble\u2019s comments criticising the ECB\u2019s loose monetary policy. Reuters reports the ministry spokesman as saying Sch\u00e4uble\u2019s comments were about the domestic debate in Germany about monetary policy, and adding that the ECB\u2019s independence was of the utmost importance. The British Steel name will be revived following confirmation that Tata has sold its UK long products business to investment group Greybull. The move should safeguard 4,400 jobs, and included a steelworks in Scunthorpe, two mills in Teesside, an engineering workshop in Workington, a design consultancy in York, and associated distribution facilities, as well as a mill in northern France. Our story is here: The European Commission is also talking of \u201cprogress\u201d in the talks between Greece and its lenders. A Commission spokeswoman said (quote from Reuters): Progress has been made over the weekend. Talks are continuing in Athens today. Our aim remains to conclude the review as soon as possible. Germany\u2019s economy has picked up speed in the first few months of the year, according to the country\u2019s economy ministry. Domestic demand has been the driver with overseas trade struggling. More fuel to the row over pay at BP: The controversy over the $20m (\u00a314m) pay for BP\u2019s chief executive has intensified after a group representing individual shareholders urged members to vote against the measure at this week\u2019s annual general meeting (AGM). ShareSoc said Bob Dudley\u2019s pay was too high for a company that suffered a record loss last year and has under performed rivals for a long time. It also reflects a convoluted incentive scheme that should be simplified, it said. Dudley\u2019s pay rose 20% last year to $19.6m as the oil company racked up a record $6.5bn loss caused by the tumbling oil price and cut thousands of jobs. His pay was increased by a more than doubling of pension payments to $6.5m from $3m that has displeased investors. Royal London Asset Management, which owns 0.7% of BP, said last week Dudley\u2019s pay was unreasonable and insensitive and that it would vote against at Thursday\u2019s AGM. Two shareholder advisers \u2013 ISS and Pirc \u2013 have recommended investors vote against BP\u2019s remuneration report and Glass Lewis, another adviser, has reportedly done the same. The full story is here: The International Monetary Fund and the other members of the troika - the EU and ECB - underestimated the impact of some of the measures it recommended for Greece, the IMF managing director Christine Lagarde has admitted. In a wide ranging interview with Bloomberg ahead of the fund\u2019s meeting this week, Lagarde said: We have acknowledged one mistake, which had to do with the fiscal multipliers where we\u2014all of us, the IMF, Europeans, the ECB [European Central Bank]\u2014underestimated the contracting impact of some of the measures that we recommended. We overestimated the ability of Greece to actually endorse and take ownership of measures that were needed, because we moved from one government to another to another to another, and it was always, \u201cIt\u2019s not really our program, it\u2019s not really our reforms, it\u2019s not really our measures. It\u2019s imposed by the Troika putting all members in the same bag.\u201d So I think that was overestimated. And she also said Greece\u2019s leaders would do more to sort out its problems: Greece cannot just continuously tag along and expect that things will be sorted out. The Greek leaders will need to take more ownership of reestablishing their country. But she expected Greece to stay in the EU: Yes, I think so. We\u2019re not out of the Greek situation yet. And I think the present circumstances with the migration and the refugees are going to strengthen the critical role Greece is playing in the EU. She also discussed the perception of the IMF, as well as her legal problems in France. Here\u2019s Reuters on the continuing talks between Greece and its creditors: Greece and its international lenders were edging closer to a compromise on signing off on a review of bailout reforms which could unlock more aid to the country, government sources said on Monday, after marathon talks with creditors. Just over ten hours of overnight negotiations between Athens and its lenders - the European Commission, the European Central Bank, European Stability Mechanism and the International Monetary Fund - broke off shortly before 0400 GMT. They were scheduled to resume later Monday. \u201cThere are some small details to settle on the fiscal side of things .. We are very close,\u201d a government source said. Divergence remained over pension reforms and regulating non-performing loans, the source added. The review has dragged on for months mainly due to a rift among the lenders over Greece\u2019s projected fiscal shortfall by 2018 - initially seen at 3 percent by the EU, 1 percent by Athens and 4.5 percent by the IMF. Athens and its lenders have agreed to use 3 percent as the baseline scenario in the Athens-based talks. But the EU and the IMF are still at odds on whether Athens could achieve a 3.5 percent primary surplus - budget balance before debt service payments - in 2018, an official participating in the talks told Reuters. The IMF, which will decide whether to co-finance Greece\u2019s third bailout after the review and in light of how much debt relief Greece receives, believes Athens will miss its 2018 surplus target and settle at 1.5 percent, even if it implements measures worth 3 percent of GDP, the official said. European markets have clawed back early losses and are now trading in positive territory. The turnaround is partly due to a rise in the Italian banking sector. European banks have come under pressure on concerns about the damage that negative interest rates will have on their stretched balance sheets. Italy\u2019s financial sector is seen as particularly vulnerable, but there are hopes that the country\u2019s government can reach an agreement on a state-backed fund to buy bad loans and underpin the sector. Mining shares are also on the rise, as copper edges higher and oil remains above $41 a barrel. Metal prices have been buoyed by hopes of further Chinese stimulus measures following the producer prices figures. Over in Greece, and some progress appears to have been made in the talks between the government and representatives of its creditors. According to the Athens-Macedonian news agency, economy minister George Stathakis said the two sides have agreed on tax issues but need further talks on bad loans: \u201cProgress has been made in order to have an agreement on bad loans, but the issue has not closed yet... We are very close [to an agreement on bad loans].\u201d Another meeting has apparently been scheduled for later today. More on the yen\u2019s rise. Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: The speed of the ascent in the Japanese yen will put markets on high alert for intervention from the Bank of Japan this week. Markets are calling the bluff of the Bank of Japan. The yen closed higher on Friday in a direct challenge to Japanese officials who had earlier in the day verbally intervened. With dollar/yen at 108, relatively strong by recent historical standards, the Bank of Japan faces a strong risk of failure by jumping the gun. Unless there is a sudden drop below 105 in the early part of the week, the BOJ will likely hold back on directly selling yen in the market. Conner Campbell of SpreadEx sums up the situation this morning: Following last Friday\u2019s rebound the markets appear to have started Monday back in a bad mood. An unexpected fall in Chinese inflation, a rapidly growing yen and fears of a gloomy statement from the IMF on Tuesday are weighing on sentiment. Germany\u2019s finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, has caused plenty of chatter this morning after announcing that central banks should tighten monetary policy. On Friday night, Sch\u00e4uble said he wasn\u2019t happy with the current record low interest rates, and is now actively pushing for hikes. He declared: I just said to [US Treasury secretary] Jack Lew that you should encourage the Federal Reserve and we should encourage the European Central Bank and the Bank of England in a concerted action, to carefully but slowly exit.\u201d Sch\u00e4uble was speaking at an event organised by a German economic think tank. It\u2019s quite a remarkable intervention, in this era of central bank independence. Schauble even blamed the ECB\u2019s ultra-loose monetary policy for the rise of the euro-sceptic Alternative for Deutschland party. \u201cI said to Mario Draghi\u2026be very proud: you can attribute 50% of the results of a party that seems to be new and successful in Germany to the design of this [monetary] policy.\u201d This chart shows why German savers are so irate: However.... they shouldn\u2019t forget that savers would also have suffered if more banks had been allowed to fail in 2008, or if the global economy had fallen into another great recession. Things could be worse...... Overnight, China\u2019s inflation rate came in lower than expected. Consumer prices across China rose by 2.3% annually in March, compared to expectations of a 2.5% rise. That\u2019s another sign that demand in the Chinese economy is losing momentum. FXTM Research Analyst Lukman Otunuga says the data has disappointed the markets. For an extended period, data from Beijing has repeatedly followed a negative path and this could be the continuing theme as the nation continues to transition away from its manufacturing roots towards the service sector. Food price inflation is picking up sharply, though. It jumped by 7.6% in March. Shares are dropping across Europe in early trading, as traders anticipate growth downgrades from the IMF tomorrow. Britain\u2019s blue-chip FTSE 100 index is down 38 points or 0.6%, and it\u2019s a similar picture in other markets: In London, retail group Next, which recently warned that trading was tough, is the biggest faller (-2%) German software group SAP has also lost 2%, after reporting that first-quarter results will miss expectations. Money is pouring into German government debt this morning. This has pushed the interest rate (or yield) on 10-year bunds to a one-year low of just 0.08% (meaning prices are at a one-year high). French bank BNP Paribas expect the International Monetary Fund to cut its forecasts tomorrow. But they also hope to hear some soothing comments from policymakers: The IMF Spring meetings begin this week, whilst the World Economic Outlook (published on Tuesday) will likely downgrade global growth forecasts. Nonetheless, we still expect comments from the meetings to be supportive of global markets. Gold has hit a three-week high this morning, thanks to worries over the global economy and the weakening dollar. Spot gold nudged $1,252.26 an ounce on Monday, its highest since March 22. OCBC Bank analyst Barnabas Gan explains (via Reuters) \u201cMarkets are still jittery about what\u2019s going on in the global economy... and gold is the preferred safe-haven.\u201d Policymakers in Japan may be getting jittery today, as they watched the yen hit a 17-month high against the US dollar. The American currency fell to just 107.63 yen to the $1, the weakest level since autumn 2014. That extends last week\u2019s 3.3% fall. Traders say the yen\u2019s strength is partly due to investors unwinding bets that US interest rates would rise several times this year. So they send the dollar down, pushing the yen up, and undermining Tokyo\u2019s efforts to push up inflation. Japan\u2019s Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga sounded a warning note to the markets. He told reporters that the current moves are due to speculative trading, and warned that the government is ready to take action against excessive yen movements if necessary. The World Bank has added to concerns over the China\u2019s economy, by trimming its growth forecasts for East Asia. It believes that the region\u2019s GDP will rise by 6.3% in 2016, down from 6.4% in its last forecasts in October. That will slow again to 6.2% in 2017 (compared to 6.3% in the previous forecasts). In 2015, the region expanded by 6.5%. Beijing\u2019s attempts to rebalance China\u2019s economy towards services and consumption are the main factor. The World Bank also sees China\u2019s growth rate slowing, from 6.9% last year to 6.7% in 2016 and 6.5% in 2017. These growth rates are still pretty punchy, compared to the advanced economies. But the World Bank also cautions that emerging markets are vulnerable. And if China slows sharply, the region could suffer \u201cspillover effects\u201d through trade and financial channels. It says: \u201cThe fundamentally positive base case for growth and poverty reduction in the region is subject to elevated risks.\u201d And those risks include the rebalancing of China\u2019s economy, weak commodity prices, and the threat that financial market volatility could feed through to the wider economy. As the World Bank puts it: \u201cIn particular, vulnerabilities created by the interplay between high levels of indebtedness, price deflation, and slowing growth in China bear close monitoring, as do corporate and financial sector vulnerabilities across much of the region.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Worries over the global economy are looming over the markets this morning. On Tuesday, the International Monetary Fund will issue its new economic projections, and many analysts fear it will slash growth forecasts again. With investor confidence weak, world trade looking shaky, and China\u2019s economy slowing, tomorrow\u2019s IMF report could be a grim reminder that the world economy is still too weak. My colleague Katie Allen explains: The IMF\u2019s latest update is expected to reprise warnings about risks from a slowdown in emerging market economies, China\u2019s downturn and lower commodity prices. It cut its outlook in January and recent downbeat comments from its managing director, Christine Lagarde, were taken by many as a hint that more cuts are to come in Tuesday\u2019s World Economic Outlook. Lagarde said in a speech that the global economy had lost momentum and that \u201cthe recovery remains too slow, too fragile, and risks to its durability are increasing.\u201d She also called on governments to pursue more growth-friendly policies. \u201cGiven comments from Christine Largarde recently, a downgrade to the IMF\u2019s world growth forecasts looks to be on the cards,\u201d said Ryan Djajasaputra, an economist at the bank Investec. Here\u2019s the full story: European stock markets are expected to fall in early trading: The economic calendar is pretty bare today. But William Dudley, an interest-rate policymaker at the US Federal Reserve, is giving a speech at around 2.45pm BST. And there may be developments in Greece, where the government continues to negotiate with creditors over its bailout programme.",

      "bodyText": "Tata Steel has agreed the sale of its UK long products business to investment group Greybull Capital for \u00a31 in a deal that will revive the British Steel brand and could save 4,400 jobs. The deal will keep open a steelworks in Scunthorpe, two mills in Teesside, an engineering workshop in Workington, a design consultancy in York, and associated distribution facilities, as well as a mill in northern France. Tata has been in talks with Greybull since late 2015 on the sale of its long products business. The agreement does not include the Port Talbot steelworks or the rest of Tata\u2019s UK business, which employs about 15,000 staff, for which it is seeking a buyer after putting it put for sale last month. The firm will be renamed British Steel, a brand which disappeared in 1999 with the creation of Corus, which was later bought by Tata. Greybull will only pay a \u201cnominal\u201d fee for Tata\u2019s Long Products Europe (LPE) division because it has agreed to taken on the firm\u2019s liabilities and put together a \u00a3400m funding package to keep the business going. A loan from the government on commercial terms could form part of this funding package. It also said that suppliers and trade unions had agreed to \u201creset the cost base\u201d of the company, indicating that they will be asked to accept less lucrative contracts. Trade union officials at Unite said proposals include a one-year pay cut of 3% and changes to their pension scheme, adding that the union has advised members to vote for the package. The changes to pay and pensions are part of the existing turnaround proposals put in place by Tata before it agreed the sale. \u201cGreybull believes these vital changes will make British Steel competitive,\u201d the firm said. \u201cThe trade union agreement is subject to a ballot of union members which will take place over the next few weeks.\u201d The sale follows a lengthy negotiation that began late last year after Tata Steel announced plans to mothball its largely UK-based LPE business, putting around 4,800 jobs at risk, 400 of them in France. Steelworkers welcomed the rescue plan after two years of uncertainty but called on the government to support the industry\u2019s recovery. Paul McBean, a union representative for Community with 42 years experience in the industry, said: \u201cWe\u2019ve spoken to a lot of the workforce and to them, it\u2019s as if a big weight\u2019s been lifted.\u201d However, he said the government needed to help reduce energy costs and business rates, as well as ensuring that big government contracts to buy steel go to British firms. \u201cEvery foreign union I spoke to can\u2019t believe our government purchases steel from abroad for infrastructure in this country. None of their governments would consider it. Imagine what we could have done with a government that backed us?\u201d Martin Foster, a steelworker and union convenor for trade union Unite, said a temporary pay cut was difficult to swallow but that the closure of the Scunthorpe plant would have devastated the town. \u201cFor a couple of years now, the Long Products business has been in limbo. We knew we were living on borrowed time. That air of uncertainty has been there for so long that today\u2019s announcement is just such a relief. We\u2019ve got a good chance now of a successful future. \u201cScunthorpe is built around the steelworks. If you took that employer away, there would be 3,500 unemployed steelworkers. The knock-on effect means the local economy would be decimated and the community as a whole. \u201cThen people wouldn\u2019t want to live here and the people who do live here would have wanted to move away.\u201d Roy Rickhuss, general secretary of Community, offered a cautious welcome for the transaction, despite looming pay cuts for staff. \u201cCommunity\u2019s independent experts, Syndex, have assessed that the transformation plan for the business is robust and Greybull has the necessary capabilities to build a sustainable business,\u201d he said. \u201cThe deal alone will be a huge boost to the UK steel industry but more government action to support our industry will be needed to ensure its sustainable long-term future. \u201cOur members are still voting on temporary changes to terms and conditions that are the result of negotiations in difficult circumstances but, should our members vote to accept the changes, they will represent a significant contribution by the workforce towards turning the business around and giving it the best possible chance of success under new ownership.\u201d Unite added that the government must now take steps to support the business to ensure workers are not left high and dry if they accept new working conditions. \u201cThis means supporting steelworkers by ensuring infrastructure such as HS2 and defence projects are built with British steel, as well as tackling the dumping of cheap imports and high energy costs, which is leaving steelworkers fighting with one hand tied behind their backs,\u201d Unite said. Founded by former Lehman Brothers investment banker Nathaniel Meyohas, Greybull has previously invested in charter airline Monarch and high street electricals retailer Comet. Greybull\u2019s investment in Monarch also resulted in staff pay cuts to secure the company\u2019s support. While the private equity firm injected \u00a375m when it bought Monarch, including the UK\u2019s oldest surviving airline brand, crew and pilots were forced to accept a rescue deal that included 30% pay cuts, slashing pilot pensions and 700 redundancies. The fleet was reduced and the network cut back to most profitable core routes. Monarch has since returned to profit, making \u00a340m in 2015, vastly aided by tumbling oil prices. While most airlines hedge their fuel buying, Monarch had been unable to do so and it quickly benefited from the sudden drop in costs. After just 17 months in charge, Greybull\u2019s owners are reportedly considering a sale of the airline, having appointed Deutsche Bank to explore options, which would land a large profit. Greybull also provided financial backing for the controversial takeover of Comet, a deal that involved investors pocketing millions of pounds as the chain collapsed into administration. Nathaniel Meyohas\u2019s brother and Greybull partner, Marc Meyohas said: \u201cWe are delighted to have reached agreement for the acquisition of LPE, which we believe can become a strong business, with a highly skilled workforce and great potential. \u201cI would personally like to thank Tata Steel, the trade unions and the British and French governments for their support, which was essential in ensuring the agreement. We are now focused on taking the deal to completion in order that the business can start its next chapter with confidence.\u201d Bimlendra Jha, executive director of Tata\u2019s long products division, said: \u201cThis sale is the best possible outcome for employees who have worked relentlessly to ensure the business\u2019s survival, and helped to make it attractive to a potential buyer.\u201d",

The agreement does not include the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/29/port-talbot-steel-plant-tata-meeting-mumbai\">Port Talbot steelworks</a> or the rest of Tata\u2019s UK business, which employs about 15,000 staff, for which it <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/06/rescue-tata-uk-port-talbot-steel-operations\"> is seeking a buyer</a> after putting it put for sale last month.</p> <p>The firm will be renamed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/04/british-steel-name-could-return-as-part-of-tata-scunthorpe-deal\">British Steel, a brand which disappeared in 1999</a> with the creation of Corus, which was later bought by Tata.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/11/taxpayer-money-may-help-rescue-port-talbot-says-sajid-javid\">Taxpayer money may help rescue Port Talbot, says Sajid Javid</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Greybull will only pay a \u201cnominal\u201d fee for Tata\u2019s Long Products Europe (LPE) division because it has agreed to taken on the firm\u2019s liabilities and put together a \u00a3400m funding package to keep the business going. A loan from the government on commercial terms could form part of this funding package.</p> <p>It also said that suppliers and trade unions had agreed to \u201creset the cost base\u201d of the company, indicating that they will be asked to accept less lucrative contracts.</p> <p>Trade union officials at Unite said proposals include a one-year pay cut of 3% and changes to their pension scheme, adding that the union has advised members to vote for the package. The changes to pay and pensions are part of the existing turnaround proposals put in place by Tata before it agreed the sale.</p> <p>\u201cGreybull believes these vital changes will make British Steel competitive,\u201d the firm said. \u201cThe trade union agreement is subject to a ballot of union members which will take place over the next few weeks.\u201d</p> <p>The sale follows a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/22/tata-steel-eyes-sale-long-products-business-investment-group\">lengthy negotiation that began late last year</a> after Tata Steel announced <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/29/tata-set-to-announce-sale-of-uk-steel-business-port-talbot\">plans to mothball its largely UK-based LPE business</a>, putting around 4,800 jobs at risk, 400 of them in France.</p> <p>Steelworkers welcomed the rescue plan after two years of uncertainty but called on the government to support the industry\u2019s recovery.</p> <p>Paul McBean, a union representative for Community with 42 years experience in the industry, said: \u201cWe\u2019ve spoken to a lot of the workforce and to them, it\u2019s as if a big weight\u2019s been lifted.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/video/2016/mar/30/the-rise-and-fall-of-the-british-steel-industry-video-explainer\"            data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/4txdj\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2481157\"            data-video-name=\"The rise and fall of the British steel industry \u2013 video explainer\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-56fbe427e4b00bae9a99a6f3\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/03/30/160330britishsteelv3_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/03/30/160330britishsteelv3.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2016/03/30/160330britishsteelv3_large.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/03/30/160330britishsteelv3_synd_768k_vp8.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2016/03/30/160330britishsteelv3_small.3gp\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/video/2016/mar/30/the-rise-and-fall-of-the-british-steel-industry-video-explainer\">The rise and fall of the British steel industry \u2013 video explainer</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>However, he said the government needed to help reduce energy costs and business rates, as well as ensuring that big government contracts to buy steel go to British firms. </p> <p>\u201cEvery foreign union I spoke to can\u2019t believe our government purchases steel from abroad for infrastructure in this country. None of their governments would consider it. Imagine what we could have done with a government that backed us?\u201d</p> <p>Martin Foster, a steelworker and union convenor for trade union Unite, said a temporary pay cut was difficult to swallow but that the closure of the Scunthorpe plant would have devastated the town.</p> <p>\u201cFor a couple of years now, the Long Products business has been in limbo. We knew we were living on borrowed time. That air of uncertainty has been there for so long that today\u2019s announcement is just such a relief. We\u2019ve got a good chance now of a successful future.</p> <p>\u201cScunthorpe is built around the steelworks. If you took that employer away, there would be 3,500 unemployed steelworkers. The knock-on effect means the local economy would be decimated and the community as a whole.</p> <p>\u201cThen people wouldn\u2019t want to live here and the people who do live here would have wanted to move away.\u201d</p> <p>Roy Rickhuss, general secretary of Community, offered a cautious welcome for the transaction, despite looming pay cuts for staff.</p> <p>\u201cCommunity\u2019s independent experts, Syndex, have assessed that the transformation plan for the business is robust and Greybull has the necessary capabilities to build a sustainable business,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThe deal alone will be a huge boost to the UK steel industry but more government action to support our industry will be needed to ensure its sustainable long-term future.</p> <p>\u201cOur members are still voting on temporary changes to terms and conditions that are the result of negotiations in difficult circumstances but, should our members vote to accept the changes, they will represent a significant contribution by the workforce towards turning the business around and giving it the best possible chance of success under new ownership.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/04/tata_steel/giv-27167F9Jw5w1ho5xv/\" data-alt=\"Tata Steel map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/04/tata_steel/giv-27167F9Jw5w1ho5xv/\">Tata Steel map</a> </figure>  <p>Unite added that the government must now take steps to support the business to ensure workers are not left high and dry if they accept new working conditions.</p> <p>\u201cThis means supporting steelworkers by ensuring infrastructure such as HS2 and defence projects are built with British steel, as well as tackling the dumping of cheap imports and high energy costs, which is leaving steelworkers fighting with one hand tied behind their backs,\u201d Unite said.</p> <p>Founded by former Lehman Brothers investment banker Nathaniel Meyohas, Greybull has previously invested in charter airline Monarch and high street electricals retailer Comet.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/25/monarch-bought-air-travel-greybull-capital\">Greybull\u2019s investment in Monarch</a> also resulted in staff pay cuts to secure the company\u2019s support.</p> <p>While the private equity firm injected \u00a375m when it bought Monarch, including the UK\u2019s oldest surviving airline brand, crew and pilots were forced to accept a rescue deal that included 30% pay cuts, slashing pilot pensions and 700 redundancies. </p> <p>The fleet was reduced and the network cut back to most profitable core routes. Monarch has since returned to profit, making \u00a340m in 2015, vastly aided by tumbling oil prices.</p> <p>While most airlines hedge their fuel buying, Monarch had been unable to do so and it quickly benefited from the sudden drop in costs. After just 17 months in charge, Greybull\u2019s owners are reportedly considering a sale of the airline, having appointed Deutsche Bank to explore options, which would land a large profit.</p> <p>Greybull also provided financial backing for the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2012/dec/18/opcapita-make-money-comet\">controversial takeover of Comet</a>, a deal that involved investors pocketing millions of pounds as the chain collapsed into administration.</p> <p>Nathaniel Meyohas\u2019s brother and Greybull partner, Marc Meyohas said: \u201cWe are delighted to have reached agreement for the acquisition of LPE, which we believe can become a strong business, with a highly skilled workforce and great potential. <br></p> <p>\u201cI would personally like to thank Tata Steel, the trade unions and the British and French governments for their support, which was essential in ensuring the agreement. We are now focused on taking the deal to completion in order that the business can start its next chapter with confidence.\u201d</p> <p>Bimlendra Jha, executive director of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/tata\">Tata\u2019</a>s long products division, said: \u201cThis sale is the best possible outcome for employees who have worked relentlessly to ensure the business\u2019s survival, and helped to make it attractive to a potential buyer.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Demand for loans from the World Bank has reached levels unsurpassed outside of financial crises as developing countries struggle to cope with the weakness of the global economy. Ahead of its half-yearly spring meeting in Washington later this week, the Bank said it expected to lend more than $150bn (\u00a3105bn) in the four years from 2013 \u2013 a period when global economic activity repeatedly failed to match expectations. The Bank said its growth forecast of 2.9% for 2016 already looked under threat after a deterioration in the outlook since the start of the year, adding that it was increasing its financial help to both middle-income and the least-developed countries. Those developing countries that rely heavily on exports of commodities have been hard hit over the past two years by the slowdown in China, which has led to a crash in the cost of oil and industrial metals. \u201cWe are in a global economy where growth is expected to remain weak, so it is critically important that the World Bank play our traditional role of helping developing countries accelerate growth,\u201d said Jim Yong Kim, the bank\u2019s president. \u201cWe have an historic opportunity to end extreme poverty in the world by 2030 but the only way we can achieve this goal is if developing countries \u2013 from middle-income to low-income nations \u2013 get back on the path of faster growth that helps the poorest and most vulnerable.\u201d The global crisis of 2008-09 led to a surge in World Bank lending to middle-income countries that struggled as trade flows and industrial production fell at rates similar to those in the early stages of the Great Depression. Demand for loans subsequently fell back from a peak of $44bn in 2010 to $15bn in 2013, although the Bank said it had risen to $23.5bn in 2015 and would top $25bn in 2016. The Bank also provides concessional loans to the least-developed countries through its International Development Association, financed by regular donations from western governments. Support for the poorest countries was expected to be near historic levels this year, the Bank said, adding that demand for non-lending advisory services, to help clients implement important policy changes, was also higher than ever. An important portion of current lending support has been in the form of development policy financing, which has backed important reforms client countries have been implementing to help diversify sources of growth and buffer against future shocks. \u201cThe use of these types of loans are important because the Bank is basically signalling to the financial markets that a country\u2019s reforms are technically solid, the country will follow through on these commitments, and the reforms will help and not hurt the poor and vulnerable,\u201d Kim said. He added that the financing provided by the Bank was \u201chighly complementary\u201d to the efforts of the International Monetary Fund to provide developing countries with stable macroeconomic policies. The Bank said two-thirds of global poverty reduction in the last half-century had been the result of faster growth, and that explained why it was using its financial clout to support policies in developing countries that led to a more rapid expansion in output.",

      "bodyText": "Persistent misconduct and an aggressive sales culture has cost the UK\u2019s banks and building societies \u00a353bn in fines, compensation and legal fees over the past 15 years. According to research published on Monday the cost of the payment protection insurance (PPI) misselling scandal has reached \u00a337.3bn \u2013 about four times the cost of the 2012 London Olympics. The New City Agenda thinktank, which published the research, said the second most costly scandal \u2013 misselling of interest rate swaps \u2013 had cost \u00a34.8bn. John McFall, the former Labour MP who used to chair the Treasury select committee, said: \u201cThe profitability of UK retail banks has been imperilled by persistent misconduct and an aggressive sales-based culture. This has made every citizen poorer through our pension funds and our ownership of the bailed-out banks.\u201d McFall, one of the co-founders of the thinktank, called on shareholders to take a lead in forcing banks to change their culture. \u201cThey should demand public and transparent assessments of the progress each individual bank is making. Where senior executives preside over misconduct, shareholders must ensure that they are held accountable and demand significant clawback of bonuses,\u201d said McFall, who sits in the House of Lords. The report builds upon the thinktank\u2019s warning in November 2014 that the culture of banking would take a generation to clean up after calculating that the UK\u2019s banks had incurred \u00a338.5bn in fines and redress for mistreatment of customers in the previous 15 years. The report focuses on the retail market so does not include the scandals that have hit the investment banking industry for rigging Libor or foreign exchange markets. It describes the fastest growing retail scandal as the sale of packaged bank accounts, where customers are sold insurance and other products alongside their current accounts. So far it has cost the banks \u00a3850m. Lloyds Banking Group \u2013 still about 9%-owned by the taxpayer \u2013 has incurred the largest bill of the high street banks for misconduct in the five years between 2010 and 2014. It has put aside \u00a314bn to cover its errors and paid \u00a32.1bn in bonuses over the same period. The bank \u2013 bailed out with \u00a320bn in 2008 as it took over HBOS \u2013 has paid out \u00a3500m to shareholders, although it was banned from making dividend payments for part of this period. New City Agenda\u2019s report said that excluding the misconduct costs, the major retail banks would be profitable. \u201cThis makes it even more important for shareholders to engage and monitor the progress made by banks in changing their cultures,\u201d it said. Measuring culture in banks has proved to be contentious. A Banking Standards Board was set up amid the Libor rigging scandal in an attempt to monitor culture in the industry. Its annual report published in March showed that it has not yet published any formal standards for banks. The Financial Conduct Authority last year faced criticism for dropping a formal review of culture but last week said it continued to regard monitoring cultures as one of its key roles. Last year, the ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s warned that the big four banks faced another \u00a319bn of conduct and litigation charges by the end of 2016 \u2013 on top of \u00a342bn incurred in the five years to 2014.",

ShareSoc said Bob Dudley\u2019s pay was too high for a company that suffered a record loss last year and has underperformed rivals for a long time. It also reflects a convoluted incentive scheme that should be simplified, it said. Dudley\u2019s pay rose 20% last year to $19.6m as the oil company racked up a record $6.5bn loss caused by the tumbling oil price and cut thousands of jobs. His pay was increased by a more than doubling of pension payments to $6.5m from $3m that has displeased investors. Royal London Asset Management, which owns 0.7% of BP, said last week Dudley\u2019s pay was unreasonable and insensitive and that it would vote against at Thursday\u2019s AGM. Two shareholder advisers \u2013 ISS and Pirc \u2013 have recommended investors vote against BP\u2019s remuneration report and Glass Lewis, another adviser, has reportedly done the same. ShareSoc said: \u201cWe consider the pay of the CEO to be simply too high, and particularly so in a year when the company suffered a record loss in 2015. Even so his pay went up by 20%. Part of the reason for the high pay was the excessively complex remuneration scheme.\u201d BP has a large cohort of small investors and ShareSoc\u2019s move makes it more likely Dudley and his fellow board members will face a rough ride at the AGM in London. Individual shareholders are more likely to ask hostile questions from the floor at AGMs than big individual investors, who prefer to make their complaints in private. ShareSoc criticised BP for claiming its pay structure was relatively simple when Dudley\u2019s cash bonus has six performance measures and the long-term incentive plan has five, only one of which is transparent to shareholders. Making Dudley\u2019s bonus pensionable creates incentives to boost short-term performance and goes against best practice, ShareSoc said. Pay will be back in the spotlight during this year\u2019s AGM season, which gets going this week as BP, miner Rio Tinto and housebuilder Persimmon face shareholders. Investors are on alert for attempts to increase salaries and overly generous pension arrangements as well as inadequate governance. BP said last week Dudley\u2019s pay was based on the policy shareholders approved two years ago and that BP\u2019s performance last year surpassed the board\u2019s expectations in the context of plunging oil prices.",

      "bodyText": "The International Monetary Fund will sound fresh alarm over the state of the global economy this week when it reveals its latest forecasts for growth against a backdrop of slower world trade and jittery financial markets. The expected warning over risks to financial stability and economic growth will underscore fears in the UK that its own economy has slowed in recent months, unable to shake off global pressures. A report from the British Chambers of Commerce on Monday points to low business confidence and a weaker sales performance across UK manufacturing and services companies. The IMF\u2019s latest update is expected to reprise warnings about risks from a slowdown in emerging market economies, China\u2019s downturn and lower commodity prices. It cut its outlook in January and recent downbeat comments from its managing director, Christine Lagarde, were taken by many as a hint that more cuts are to come in Tuesday\u2019s World Economic Outlook. Lagarde said in a speech that the global economy had lost momentum and that \u201cthe recovery remains too slow, too fragile, and risks to its durability are increasing.\u201d She also called on governments to pursue more growth-friendly policies. \u201cGiven comments from Christine Largarde recently, a downgrade to the IMF\u2019s world growth forecasts looks to be on the cards,\u201d said Ryan Djajasaputra, an economist at the bank Investec. The new economic outlook, published ahead of the IMF and World Bank spring meetings later in the week, is also likely renew its warnings about risks to the global economy from expected moves by the US Federal Reserve to lift interest rates back to more normal levels. In January, the IMF forecast world output would grow 3.4% this year and 3.6% in 2017. That was 0.2 percentage points lower than forecasts made just three months earlier, and the fund said that the risks to its predictions were to the downside. The new outlook will also include forecasts for individual countries, including the UK. The IMF has recently highlighted Britain\u2019s relatively strong recovery, but has expressed concern about the economic impact of June\u2019s EU referendum. The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) said its survey of more than 8,500 firms suggested that growth in the UK economy waned in the first quarter. Sales slowdown points to weaker GDP growth Several key indicators for the services sector \u2013 the UK\u2019s main driver of economic growth \u2013 fell slightly, with domestic sales and orders reaching their lowest level for more than three years, the business group said. For manufacturing, domestic sales growth also weakened. Confidence in turnover and profitability for both services and manufacturing remained low by historical standards, the BCC said. \u201cOur latest survey results suggest that the UK economy is in a holding pattern. While the picture is static overall, there are clear indications that economic growth is continuing to soften,\u201d said the group\u2019s acting director general Adam Marshall. \u201cFrom sales and orders to confidence and investment intentions, many of the business indicators we track are at a low ebb.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Whether or not the minister for education knows the size of his Hecs debt is irrelevant but the recent report by the Parliamentary Budget Office certainly lets him know the impact of university fee deregulation on the debt of both students and the government. When Simon Birmingham was asked about the size of his own Hecs debt he admitted that he couldn\u2019t remember it. I\u2019m always a bit hesitant to get too excited about such gotcha questions because a) generally they don\u2019t reveal much, and b) often I don\u2019t know the answer myself. I get worried when treasurers clearly don\u2019t understand the impact of their policy \u2013 such as when Joe Hockey tried to suggest the fuel excise indexation was a progressive tax. But, for example, when Chris Bowen got stuck when asked by Alan Jones about the tax scales I have to confess I often forget some of them. Generally I confuse whether or not one threshold is $32,500 or $37,000 before remembering it is the latter and the tax rate is 32.5%. Even now I must admit I had to check the ATO\u2019s page just to make sure I got them right. The same memory loss struck me when considering the question of Birmingham\u2019s Hecs debt. Birmingham is a couple of years older than me, so we\u2019re roughly the same vintage, and I have to admit I also can\u2019t remember what my debt was when I left uni in 1993. I think it might have been about $11,000 but I\u2019d say the margin of error on that is plus or minus $2,000. A quick (admittedly very small sample) survey of friends had most of them also admitting they had no idea what their debt was \u2013 certainly those in ignorance were in the majority, including those who have graduated in the past decade. Perhaps it is a generational thing \u2013 perhaps yet another example of the differences of generations \u2013 some of the boomers got their education for free, the Gen Xers had to pay Hecs but can\u2019t remember it, and Gen Y are vitally aware of how great is their debt. This issue arose because Birmingham has recently made it clear that the government intends to continue with a form of deregulation of the tertiary sector \u2013 despite it being a large part of the failed 2014 budget \u2013 a policy that will see student debt escalate exponentially. It also came after a report by the Parliamentary Budget Office report on the costs of the Hecs/Help schemes that showed the cost to the budget of the scheme will grow from $1.7bn this year to $11.1bn in 2025-26. One aspect perhaps not widely understood is that Hecs/Help loans are not a direct cost to the budget. Your Help loan from the government is just that, a loan, and thus is treated as an asset for budget purposes because you are expected to repay it. But this does not mean the loans do not add to the budget\u2019s bottom line. Because the government has to pay the interest on the money loaned to you while you get around to repaying it \u2013 and the interest it pays is higher than the one students pay on their loans. It also has to cover loans not repaid. As the PBO notes, \u201cthe debt used to finance the Help loans needs to be serviced even if borrowers are not making repayments\u201d \u2013 and if the amount being repaid is less than the cost of servicing new loans then the total cost to the budget increases. The cumulative impact of the Hecs/Help loans on the budget add to the government\u2019s debt levels. And because currently other aspects of debt are expected to peak and student loans are expected to keep growing, that means Hecs/Help loans start to take on a greater proportion of the government debt level. Currently Hecs/Help loans account for about 8% of the net debt held by the government but the PBO estimates than by 2025-26 that will be up to 18%. It is worth noting, however, that this increase in debt is not due to an increase in students. The PBO estimates a fairly flat trajectory of students in both university and the non-university tertiary sector. The PBO estimates the large increases occur because it assumes the government\u2019s current policy of deregulating the tertiary sector will go ahead. It assumes that due to this policy universities will recover their costs from cuts to the commonwealth grants scheme by increasing fees by about 40% and then that universities will also increase fees \u201cby 2% in real terms each year from 2018, over and above recouping cuts in the commonwealth grant scheme\u201d. Birmingham suggested on ABC\u2019s 7.30 that the main reason for the increase in costs was due to the ALP government\u2019s decision to open the Help system to the private vocational education sector. And certainly that policy did open up students to a great deal of shonky behaviour and skyrocketing fees. A parliamentary review of the program found that many private vocational educational operators were viewing the use of Help loans as a means of profit growth \u2013 with the costs of some courses increasing by as much as $18,000. Moreover, although Tafe accounts for \u201cnearly twice as many government-funded students in VET courses as were enrolled with other providers \u2026 more than 75% of VET FEE-HELP funding goes to private, for profit providers\u201d. And because of the dubious quality of many of those courses, the likelihood of students repaying that loan is diminished compared to those from other institutions. Similarly while the decision by the ALP government to uncap university student numbers has allowed an increase in people attending university, because more people have degrees, the currency of that degree has fallen \u2013 with starting salaries. But the PBO found that the main driver of the increase in the size of the overall level of Help debt was the projected increases in student fees from 2017 due to the announced higher education reforms. The increase in fee leads to an increase in the level of debt help by students and also an increase in the amount of debt not repaid by students. The PBO report has been seen as somehow being a wake-up call on the time bomb of debt that is the student loan scheme but really it is a wake-up call on the impact of the government\u2019s policy of fee deregulation. Not only will it lead to students being lumped with higher levels of debt, so too will it increase the government\u2019s own debt and increase the difficulty of returning the budget to surplus. Whether or not the minister for education knows his own student debt level is rather irrelevant but it is inexcusable if he goes ahead with fee deregulation now that the debt impact on students and the government is brutally clear.",
