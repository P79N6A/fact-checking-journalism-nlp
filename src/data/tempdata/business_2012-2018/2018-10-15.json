      "bodyText": "Philip Hammond will need \u00a319bn from higher taxes, extra borrowing or faster-than-expected growth if this month\u2019s budget is to fulfil the prime minister\u2019s promises to end austerity and boost NHS spending, according to the UK\u2019s leading experts on the public finances. The Institute for Fiscal Studies said the pledge by Theresa May at this year\u2019s Conservative party conference to end eight years of cuts was \u201cunlikely\u201d to be compatible with the chancellor\u2019s aim of balancing the nation\u2019s books unless some tough decisions were made. In its traditional pre-budget analysis of the budget options available to the Treasury, the thinktank said Hammond would need to find \u00a319bn a year by 2022-23 to meet the government\u2019s spending commitments for health, defence and aid, and to reverse planned cuts to public spending in other areas. The IFS said this was a \u201cminimal definition\u201d of ending austerity because sparing Whitehall departments and local government further retrenchment would still leave \u00a37bn of welfare cuts in the pipeline. Hammond\u2019s budget planning has been aided by smaller-than-forecast deficits in the first half of the current fiscal year but the IFS said the improvement would not be enough on its own to fund an \u201cend to austerity\u201d. Nor could the chancellor rely on a Brexit dividend between now and 2022-23 because any reductions in net budget payments to the EU would be less than \u00a31bn a year by then and could easily be eaten up by higher spending on border security. Paul Johnson, the director of the IFS, said the chancellor had a big choice to make but that the \u201cline of least resistance\u201d for Hammond would be to borrow more and run a bigger deficit over the coming years than currently planned. \u201cHe could end austerity, as the prime minister has suggested. But even a limited definition of what that might mean would imply spending \u00a319bn a year more than currently planned by the end of the parliament. An increase of that size is highly unlikely to be compatible with his desire to get the deficit down towards zero. \u201cAlternatively, the chancellor could stick to his guns on the deficit and leave many public services to struggle under the strain of a decade and more of cuts. He could reconcile these demands by raising taxes, and in principle there are plenty of good options, but the overall tax burden is already high by UK historical standards and he could be constrained by the lack of a parliamentary majority. This is going to be the toughest of circles to square.\u201d The IFS annual \u201cgreen budget\u201d said Hammond could raise \u00a319bn by raising taxes by 1% of national income. This would leave the UK tax burden at its highest level since the late 1940s \u2013 but near the middle of the league table of rich country members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. There were several options for increasing taxes in ways that would particularly affect relatively well-off members of the older generation and which would in general improve the efficiency of the tax system, the IFS said. These included taxing pension pots that are bequeathed, reforming council tax and making capital gains tax payable at death. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said: \u201cThis heaps yet more pressure on the chancellor to explain how he is going to deliver on the Tory promise of ending austerity. \u201cWith billions of cuts in the form of universal credit still to come, and public services at breaking point, tinkering around the edges is not enough. It\u2019s time the chancellor finally came clean about where the additional funding for the NHS is coming from.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "So ends another tense day in the markets. It began with another day of losses in Asia, with China\u2019s market dropping to their lowest close since late 2014. Europe then had a wobbly session, before the UK\u2019s FTSE 100 managed to close nearly 0.5% higher. Brexit remained a worry, as UK PM Theresa May warned that she can\u2019t accept Brussels\u2019 proposal for a backstop for Northern Ireland. The US market failed to sparkle, after the latest US retail sales figures were weaker than expected - only growing by 0.1% in September. There was no big sell-off in New York, but the main indices did end the day lower. The tech sector remained under pressure, due to its exposure to global growth, and its vulnerability to disruption from a trade war. Hardware maker Cisco Systems was the biggest faller on the Dow, down 2.2%, followed by Apple (-2.1%), Visa (2%) and Microsoft (-1.8%). The disappearance of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in Turkey also loomed over the markets. The oil price has risen - Brent is 0.4% higher at $80.76 tonight - amid chatter that Riyadh could cut supplies in retaliation for any sanctions. And on the fiscal side, America\u2019s budget deficit has jumped to $779bn, thanks to a burst of spending. That\u2019s all from us today. Goodnight. So much for the rally! A late swirl of selling has sent Wall Street into the red at the closing bell. The Dow shed 89 points, or 0.35%, back down to 25,250. The Nasdaq had a worse day, losing 1%. Once again, anxiety over US interest rate rises and worries over an economic slowdown weighed on the markets. Is volatility turning into the new normal? It\u2019s certainly more common than it used to be.... Here\u2019s a couple of photos from Wall Street today: And here\u2019s a photo from Riyadh, where the Tadawul All-Share Index (TASI) jumped by 3.5%, after heavy losses on Sunday With one hour\u2019s trading to go, Wall Street is edging higher. The Dow is now up 0.5%, or 122 points, at 25,462, and on track for its second \u2018up day\u2019 in a row. The numbers are in.... America\u2019s budget deficit jumped by over $100bn in the last fiscal year, to nearly $780bn. Higher defence and social security spending helped to drive up the deficit, even though the economy grew strongly too. Marketwatch has the details: The U.S. recorded a $779 billion deficit in the fiscal year ending Sept. 30, an increase of $113 billion, as spending climbed while revenue remained nearly flat, the Treasury Department announced Monday. Outlays grew by $127 billion, or 3.2%, while government receipts rose 0.4%, or $14 billion. Compared to GDP, the deficit rose to 3.9%, up by 0.4 percentage points. In September alone, the U.S. recorded a surplus of $119.1 billion. UK defence firm BAE Systems saw its shares fall today, as traders pondered the implications of the Khashoggi case. Earlier, Donald Trump told reporters that the Saudi king had firmly denied being responsible for the journalist\u2019s disappearance - indeed, Trump suggested that rogue elements could be to blame (inside the Saudi consulate in Ankara?). Trump has now dispatched his Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, to the Middle East to investigate. Fiona Cincotta of City Index says the Saudi tensions loomed over the City: Ironically, it was UK defence giant BAE Systems that bore the brunt of the dispute, trading down 3.46% on the day, as a conflict with the oil producing country could threaten its \u00a310 billion deal for 48 Typhoon jets. The oil market was surprisingly placid about rising political tensions with Brent crude trading up 0.35% and WTI up 0.39%. Instead some investment went into gold and gold shares, notably Rangold and Anglo American. Germany\u2019s stock market also had a better day, with the DAX gaining 90 points or 0.8%. France ended slightly lower, though. A day that started with blustery rain and deep puddles in the City of London has ended with a modest recovery. The FTSE 100 has nudged its way back over the 7,000 point mark, gaining 33 points or 0.45% to finish at 7,029. This means the Footsie has avoided setting another six-month closing low, as looked possible this morning. Wall Street is attempting to push higher, and add to Friday\u2019s recovery. The Dow is now up 84 points, or 0.3%, while the Nasdaq is coming off its lows. Last week\u2019s market sell-off was partly due to worries that the global economy is slowing. And Capital Economics has added to those concerns, by predicting that the next recession could be closer than previously thought. Neil Shearing, their chief economist, believes it will be triggered in America, as the Federal Reserve raises rates to calm inflation (as Donald Trump has warned). Shearin\u001cg writes: The next global downturn is likely to come much sooner than the current consensus anticipates \u2013 indeed, we think that world GDP growth is already peaking in this cycle and that it will slow relatively sharply in 2019-20. The downturn itself is likely to be led by the US, where higher interest rates will begin to weigh on rate-sensitive sectors of the economy, and China, which is undergoing a structural slowdown. And while we anticipate that the next global downturn will be relatively short and mild compared to previous cycles, there is a long and growing list of threats that mean there is a significant risk of a sharper adjustment. The newswires are reporting that Janet Yellen, the former chair of the US Federal Reserve, has criticised Donald Trump for his attacks on her predecessor, Jerome Powell. Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal has the details: Yellen also cited the danger that the US economy is running too hot, and also cautioned that the US trade dispute with China could hurt the global economy. Back in New York, the sell-off is gathering momentum. The Nasdaq tech index is now down 1%. Pharmaceuticals giant AstraZeneca has frozen investment in the UK until it knows what\u2019s happening with Brexit, according to the firm\u2019s chairman. Leif Johansson told French newspaper Le Monde that the UK-Swedish firm has activated its contingency plans. It is now stockpiling medicines at national borders and has duplicated some of its UK operations in Sweden. Johansson, whose company has operations in Cambridge and Macclesfield, adds: We have also stopped investing in the UK. More here. The chimes of the opening bell are ringing out across Wall Street, teeing up a fresh week\u2019s trading. Traders are edgy following the worst week since March, and in the face of rising tensions around Saudi Arabia. And...shares are dipping in early trading. The Dow Jones industrial average has shed 20 points, or 0.1%, while the Nasdaq is 0.3% lower. Big tech stocks, including Facebook, Netflix and Amazon, are among the big fallers: Back in London, the FTSE 100 has struggled back from his morning\u2019s six-month low. It\u2019s now up 19 points , or 0.3%, at 7015. But the FTSE 250 index, which contains smaller UK companies, is having a worse day. It\u2019s down 199 points, or 1%, at 18,774, partly due to those nasty profit warnings from SuperDry and ConvaTec this morning. The weak US retail sales growth in September has surprised City economics and investors - here\u2019s some early reaction: Just in: Americans spent less in restaurants and malls than expected last month. US retail sales only rose by 0.1% in September, much weaker than the 0.6% growth which economists had expected. This is partly due to a 1.8% fall in spending at restaurants and bars, the biggest drop since December 2016. That wiped out a 0.8% surge in car purchases. Clothing sales rose by 0.5%, while online and mail-order shopping jumped by 1.1%. Such a big drop in spending in bars and eateries could worry economists - it may signal that US consumers are cutting back. However, it could also be due to one-off factors, such as the hurricanes which hit the US last month. Two more top US executives have pulled out of Saudi Arabia\u2019s \u2018Davos in the desert\u2019 event, over the disappearance of Jamal Khashoggi. Blackstone\u2019s Stephen Schwarzman and BlackRock\u2019s Larry Fink have both withdraw from the high-profile Saudi Arabian investment conference taking place later this month (with a shrinking guest list). Over the weekend, the CEO of JP Morgan and the chairman of Ford both cancelled, as the furore over Khashoggi\u2019s disappearance intensified. Other top bosses are still weighing up their next move -- but I suspect we\u2019re reaching where attending the event is more controversial than finding a previous engagement in the diary (or even subsequent one...) Britain\u2019s shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, has called for Britain to rethink its relationship with Riyadh too: We should not be in league with a brutal dictatorship that beheads its own citizens for standing up for their rights, which rains down airstrikes on civilian areas in Yemen with no concern for innocent children, and that thinks it can assassinate dissident journalists in other countries with impunity. We must apply the same standards to countries such as Saudi Arabia, Israel and Egypt that we apply to Iran, Russia and Syria. Where any of them abuse human rights and breach international humanitarian law, we must be prepared to call it out in the same measure, rather than treating it as one rule for our supposed friends and another for our supposed enemies. Just in: Bank of America has beaten Wall Street forecasts, which might calm some investors\u2019 nerves. The second-largest US bank make profits of 66 cents per share in the last quarter, ahead of the 62 cents expected by analysts. Revenues grew by 4%, as Bank of America benefitted from higher interest rates and recent US tax cuts. Chief executive officer Brian Moynihan sounds upbeat, declaring: \u201cResponsible growth, backed by a solid U.S. economy and a healthy U.S. consumer, combined to deliver the highest quarterly pre-tax earnings in our company\u2019s history.\u201d More UK retail gloom: Fashion accessories retailer Claire\u2019s is considering a raft of store closures in the UK, according to a report on the Press Association. The US stock market is expected to lose ground when trading begins in three hours. The futures market is indicating the Dow Jones industrial average will shed 106 points, or 0.4%, at the open. New retail sales figures (at 1.30pm UK time) and financial results from Bank of America could both move the markets. The main Asian stock markets have all closed in the red today. Japan fell by almost 1.8%, Hong Kong lost 1.5%, Shanghai shed 1.4% and Australia finished 1% lower (our earlier summary has more details) The oil price is pushing higher this morning, amid rising tensions between Saudi and the US over the disappearance of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Brent crude has risen 1% to $81.25 per barrel, back towards the four-year high set earlier this month. Bloomberg is reporting that the Saudi King has ordered an \u201cinternal probe\u201d into the Khashoggi - who is presumed to have been murdered after entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. On Saturday, US president Donald Trump vowed \u2018severe punishment\u2019 if it was confirmed that the Saudi regime had killed Khashoggi. This was a hardening of Trump\u2019s original position, that he didn\u2019t want to risk investment and jobs over the case. Saudi Arabia, though, denies being involved -- and has now vowed to retaliate if sanctions are imposed. In theory, Saudi could hurt America badly by cutting crude production -- in a repeat of the 1970s oil shock. That would send transport costs soaring, drive inflation higher, and hurt growth. Saudi is the biggest single producer in the Opec cartel, producing over 10 million barrels today (global demand is 100 barrels/day), so it could have a major impact on prices. However, there\u2019s an argument that rival suppliers, such as the US shale industry, could step in to fill a production shortfall. Ouch. Germany\u2019s stock exchange has now overcome its technical issues, and traders are sending shares lower. The DAX has dipped by 20 points, or 0.18%, to 11,503 points, a new 20-month low. The gold price has jumped by 1% today to $1,231 per ounce. Bullion is benefiting from a \u201cflight to safety\u201d as nervous investors look for a safer place for their money, says Stephen Innes of trading firm OANDA: While the market\u2019s version of a \u201cRed October \u201c makes it way into the South China Sea, echoes of Octobers past are reverberating throughout global capital markets as risk off continues to linger with equity market look ever so fragile. The US Treasury is set to release the semi-annual FX report. While China doesn\u2019t meet the historical criteria to be named a currency manipulator who is to say, President Trump, my not rewrite the requirements so that China\u2019s inclusion in the future is assured? Geopolitical embers are smouldering, threatening to ignite the middle east powder over the disappearance of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. The UK FTSE 100 has just hit a new six-month low, as its early gains fizzle out. The blue-chip index of leading sharews in London is now down 27 points at 6968. That\u2019s its lowest level since the end of March, adding to last week\u2019s losses. This follows the weak trading in Asia (where Japan lost 1.8% and China fell 1.4%). Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell explains: \u201cThere is a noticeable lack of bargain hunters on Monday morning as last Friday\u2019s rebound in select parts of the market fails to extend into the new working week. The FTSE 100 was down 0.1% in early trading at 6,988 with investors clearly lacking confidence to snap up stocks whose share prices were badly damaged in last week\u2019s market sell-off. The biggest riser is gold producer Randgold \u2013 a traditional \u2018safe-haven\u2019 in troubled times, with other \u2018defensive\u2019 stocks such as British American Tobacco and BT Group also in demand. Engineering firms such as Melrose and BAE are among the big fallers: Pakistan\u2019s stock market has made a bad start to the new week, falling over 2% in early trading. That follows a 4% tumble last week, as investors fretted about Pakistan\u2019s economic outlook. Prime Minister Imran Khan is seeking an emergency bailout from the International Monetary Fund, who may demand tough austerity measures in return. Germany\u2019s stock exchange has been hit by a technical glitch that has prevented trading getting underway. The Financial Times explains: The opening of trade in Deutsche B\u00f6rse\u2019s stock market, the primary trading venue for German equities, was delayed on Monday by \u201ctechnical problems\u201d. Deutsche B\u00f6rse\u2019s Xetrastock exchange, one of Europe\u2019s biggest, faced issues with its \u201ctrading infrastructure\u201d which meant the \u201ctrading start will not take place according to the usual trading schedule.\u201d So, we can\u2019t see how the German DAX is faring yet.... As feared, there\u2019s no recovery in Europe\u2019s stock market this morning. The Stoxx 600 index, which tracks the largest European companies, has dropped by another 0.4% to a fresh 22-month low. With traders reluctant to take risks, there\u2019s a jittery feel in the trading floors again. Kit Juckes of Societe Generale says: The Swiss franc and yen are stronger. Hard Brexit risks are mounting, global political risks are ever-present and equities and bond yields are lower ex-Italy. The breakdown in Brexit talks, the disappearance of dissident Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, the demise of the CSU in Bavarian elections, the impasse over Italy\u2019s budget and the worried tone coming from the IMF/World Bank meetings in Bali all combine to give financial markets an uncomfortable feel this morning. Shares in UK fashion group SuperDry have plunged by 20% after it shocked the City with a profits warning. SuperDry says that the \u201cunseasonably hot weather conditions\u201d in the UK, Continental Europe and on the East Coast of America has hit demand for its autumn ranges, and wipe \u00a310m off profits. In another blow, the company is taking an \u00a38m hit on foreign exchange costs, after discovering that its \u201chedging mechanisms\u201d have not protected it from volatility in the currency markets. Investors aren\u2019t impressed - sending SuperDry shares sliding from \u00a310.15 to just \u00a38.12. At the start of the year they were worth \u00a320. Astonishingly, that\u2019s not enough to make SuperDry the worst-performing stock today. That \u2018honour\u2019 goes to medical equipment maker ConvaTec, whose shares have lurched 30% lower. The colostomy and wound bag manufacturer has slashed its profit forecasts, due to \u201cchallenging market dynamics\u201d, and its CEO is retiring. In London, the FTSE 100 index has opened 20 points higher (+0.3%), as traders try to put last week\u2019s losses behind them. Artjom Hatsaturjants at City firm Accendo Markets says the pound\u2019s weakness is helping multinational companies: The muted open comes after a negative start to the week in Asia, where concerns over rising US interest rates continued weighing on equities. Brexit negotiations suffered another setback over the weekend, as PM Theresa May rejected key EU proposals over the Irish border, dealing a blow to negotiations to avert a hard Brexit. This has sent the GBP [the pound] sharply lower ahead of an EU leaders summit on Wednesday, helping FTSE\u2019s international names. After another day of losses, China\u2019s stock market has sunk to its lowest closing level in almost four years. CHINA\u2019S SHANGHAI COMPOSITE INDEX CLOSES DOWN 1.49% TO 2568.1 CHINA\u2019S CSI 300 INDEX FALLS 1.4% TO 3,126.45 AT CLOSE A cocktail of risks are weighing on the markets, says Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group: Concerns over higher US borrowing costs were the catalyst for last week\u2019s heavy sell off. However, there were plenty of other risk factors which were also dampening sentiment. Those risk factors, including US- Sino trade tensions, Brexit, Italy\u2019s Budget proposal and now increased political tensions between the US and Saudi Arabia, are set to keep pressure on risk appetite this week. Good morning from a wet and grisly London. Last week wasn\u2019t a pretty one for the City - the FTSE 100 fell steadily to a six-month low, while European stock sank to their lowest in 21 months. And as the rain tips down, there\u2019s little sign of optimism in the markets today. Germany traders have been rattled by yesterday\u2019s Bavarian state parliament election, which saw the ruling Christian Social Union lose its majority. That\u2019s another blow to Angela Merkel (whose CDU party are partners with the CSU) There are tensions in Italy too, where the government is expected to approve its new budget, despite complaints from Brussels that it will breach EU fiscal rules. Yesterday, Italian prime minister Giuseppe Conte announced the budget would be \u201ca change of gear for Italy\u201d. Conte suggests Europe would soften its view, once Rome has explained its growth strategy to them.... But until that happens, investors will fear another episode in the eurozone debt crisis. Spread-betting firm IG predicts fresh losses in Frankfurt and Milan today: The losses continue to mount up on financial markets amid uncertainty across the world about trade, rising US interest rates and now a potential clash between the US and Saudi Arabia over the fate of missing journalist Jamal Khashoggi. The Saudi tension has sent the price of oil up and it\u2019s also been a rough night for the pound ahead of this week\u2019s crunch Brexit summit with sterling slipping. The yen meanwhile has strengthened a touch against the dollar. Stock markets fell in Asia overnight led by the Nikkei in Japan. It is off 1.85% (not helped by the rising yen). Seoul -0.7%, the Hang Seng -1.24% and Shanghai is off 0.83%. The ASX200 in Sydney closed down 0.99%. Futures trade suggests a flat start later today for the FTSE100 while the Dax30 in Germany is seen dropping 0.25%. Wall Street is tipped to fall too. The pound is down 0.3% to $1.31 and \u20ac1.135. Brent crude is up 1.25% amid Saudi tensions. JP Morgan and Ford bosses have joined the boycott of the Future Investment Intiative conference in Riyadh next week in the wake of the Khashoggi affair. China says it faces \u201cuncertainties\u201d but has \u201cplenty of room\u201d for fiscal manoeuvre if thin gs get sticky. Which they nevertheless say they won\u2019t. The US dollar rose against the euro and other currencies. These included the Aussie dollar, a proxy for emerging market sentiment, which slipped to US71.06c from US71.26c on Friday. I\u2019m signing off now. It\u2019s been an interesting day but it\u2019s time to hand over to Graeme Wearden in London. Thanks for joining us. It will be fascinating to see where the price of oil goes this week. Brent futures have risen 1.255 today to $81.5 a barrel and that could rise to $100 according to one analyst. Kazuhiko Fuji, senior fellow at the Japanese government thinktank, the Research Institute of Economy, Trade and Industry, said: Oil prices could rise to $100 on worries about Saudi Arabia. People had thought the Saudis will make up for fall in Iran\u2019s output. If they are starting to use oil as their weapon, that will be a whole new chapter. Apologies - I jumpped the gun on the Aussie market. The final settlemtn pushed it deeper into the red to end down 58.6 points, or 0.99%, at 5837.1 points. Sears, the venerable US retailer, has gone into administration. It has filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy, according to a filing in a New York court, Reuters reports. The filing says Sears, which once dominated US retailing in the golden age of catalogues, has assets in the range of $1bn to 10bn and liabilities in the range of $10bn to $50bn. The ASX200 is done for the day. It finishes down 46 points, or 0.79%, at 5,849 points. Saudi Arabia has threatened to retaliate against the world economy if western nations impose sanctions or similar if it emerges that the country\u2019s security forces murdered the journalist Jamal Khashoggi. But what form could Saudi action take? Our business reporter Rob Davies has been looking at the issues and his main points are The Saudis have the obvious power to push up oil prices. it\u2019s the world\u2019s biggest producer and reducing output would see prices rise, possibly causing a devastating oil shock to the world economy. Second, the Saudis support thousands of US jobs through their extensive arms imports. Loss of those contracts would damage Donald Trump and he has already flagged that he doesnn\u2019t want to jeopradise those deals for companies such as Boeing and Lockheed. Saudi funds are also important to planned US infrastructure development. And it is a key strategic ally in the Middle East On the other side of the ledger, the Saudis are relying on western companies to reform the kingdom\u2019s stagnant economy and diversify it away from oil. The growing boycott of next week\u2019s Future Investment Initiative conference in Riyadh (now including JP Morgan and Ford) shows possible leverage. it will be a blow to Prince Mohammed\u2019s prestige if more high-profile names pull out. You can read Rob\u2019s full piece here: We seem to have hit a fairly quiet spot in the trading day. The ASX200 in Sydney is down around 1% and is due to close in a few minutes. The Nikkei hasn\u2019t moved from the -1.5% mark for a couple of hours. Ditto the Kospi (-0.5%) and the Hang Seng ( -0.1%). The CSI300 in Shanghai is probably the biggest mover, sliding from positive territory a couple of hours ago to now being off 0.8%. Talking of China, it\u2019s worth revisiting comments by the country\u2019s central bank governor at the close of the IMF meeting in Bali on Sunday. Yi Gang said China still had plenty of room for adjustment in interest rates and the reserve requirement ratio (RRR) in the face of any negative impact from trade tensions with the United States. He admitted China faced \u201ctremendous uncertainties\u201d but was seeking a \u201cconstructive solution\u201d to the current trade tensions. \u201cWe still have plenty of monetary policy instruments in terms of interest rate policy, in terms of RRR. We have plenty of room for adjustment, just in case we need it,\u201d Yi said, indicating that Beijing feels it has plenty of ammunition to fire up the economy if needed. He added that he expected GDP to print at least 6.5% on Friday. Chris Weston of Pepperstone in Melbourne has weighed with some commentary, saying things could quite ugly on stock markets if data out of China \u2013 inflation, GDP and retail sales \u2013 disappoints later in the week. After last week\u2019s volatility shock to markets, we start the week on a negative tone, with broad weakenss through Asia and the ASX 200 falling out of bed. The weekend news flow has centred on a lack of progress in the Brexit negotiations, a deterioration in Saudi/US relations, which have resulted in a 1.1% rally in crude, and the loss of majority for the CSU party in the German regional elections. Here are the latest scores, courtesy of IC Markets (although I think they\u2019ve missed the minus sign off the Hang Seng price): Summing up nicely, Masayuki Kubota, chief strategist at Rakuten Securities says: \u201cWe can\u2019t say the shock is over.\u201d The pound is set for a volatile few days as the wrangling over Brexit intensifies ahead of the meeting of European leaders starting on Wednesday night. It sits at $1.31 at the moment after losing 0.3% today. The key issue is how to prevent a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic. The EU wants the North to remain essentially bound by EU customs rules but that is facing pushback from Brexiters. Theresa May is hoping a temporary \u201cbackstop\u201d can be put in place where the whole country remains in the customs deal for the time being. (There\u2019s a good explainer here from Daniel Boffey, or Brussels correspondent.) Meanwhile, former foreign secretary and would-be Tory leader, Boris Johnson, has sounded off again in his Telegraph column. He says the backstop idea should be rejected completely and says the EU is treating the UK \u201cwith contempt\u201d: In presuming to change the constitutional arrangements of the United Kingdom, the EU is treating us with naked contempt. Like some chess player triumphantly forking our king and our queen, the EU commission is offering the UK government what appears to be a binary choice. It is a choice between the break-up of this country, or the subjugation of this country, between separation or submission. So seems like a good moment to run this brilliant picture of UK foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt and other foreign ministers in the maze at his country retreat Chevening this weekend. Still with Australia and interesting to note that Shane Oliver, the high-profile chief economist at AMP, has suggested that he might have to revise downwards his forecasts on house prices. He tweeted on Saturday that the auction results weren\u2019t good but his forecast of a peak to trough fall of 15% out to 2020 remained in place. But he told the AFR that he might hve to rethink that forecast on the downside. \u201cThe risks are skewing to greater than 5% declines per year, which is what I\u2019ve been assuming,\u201d he told the Financial Review on Sunday. \u201cI am thinking about revising down again.\u201d In Australia the ASX200 has had a torrid morning. At one point it was down more than 1.5% but it has recovered at bit and is now at 5,829, a fall of 66 points or 1.1%. The financial sector has been battered amid concern about the impact of the royal commission on the big four and the amount of compensation they will have to pay. Commonwealth is the worst performing, down more than 2%. There\u2019s also the question of the impact from a deteriorating housing market. According to the AFR this morning, less than half of properties at auction this weekend were sold. That\u2019s a bad outcome during what should be one of the busiest times of the year. Agents are blaming lack of credit for buyers pulling out. The Chinese trading day has kicked off. The Hang Seng is down nearly 1% while the Shanghai Composite is up a fraction. Another major factor in stock market losses this week has been the prospect of a full-blown US-China trade war. But calls for calm from leaders gathered at the IMF conference in Bali last week seem to have fallen on deaf ears. The Chinese currency fell again against the dollar today. It\u2019s now at 6.92. That is sure to rattle Washington where there is a widespread view that beijing manipulates the currency to benefit exporters. In Sunday\u2019s IMF communique, members agreed to debate ways to improve the World Trade Organization so it can better address trade disputes and that countries would \u201crefrain from competitive devaluations and will not target our exchange rates for competitive purposes\u201d. The latter point address concern that China will allow the yuan to depreciate in order to make its exports more competitive to cope with any downside from US tariffs. Hmm ... While the Ssudi government has come out fighting on the prospect of US sanctions in the Khashoggi case, the boss of the Saudi-owned Al-Arabiya satellite news network has gone a few steps further. Turki Aldakhil paints an apocalyptic picture of world affairs if the US tries to get tough on the Saudis. He says the kingdom would respond by slashing oil output and would team up with Russia and stop buying US arms. The US would be \u201cstabbing itself to death\u201d. Imposing any type of sanctions on Saudi Arabia by the West will cause the kingdom to resort to other options, US President Donald Trump had said a few days ago, and that Russia and China are ready to fulfill Riyadh\u2019s military needs among others. No one can deny that repercussions of these sanctions will include a Russian military base in Tabuk, northwest of Saudi Arabia, in the heated four corners of Syria, Israel, Lebanon and Iraq. At a time where Hamas and Hezbollah have turned from enemies into friends, getting this close to Russia will lead to a closeness to Iran and maybe even a reconciliation with it. The list of marquee speakers at the Future Investment Intiative conference in Saudi Arabia next week makes interesting reading because a few of them have now said they will not be going. Jamie Dimon has pulled out along with the boss of Uber and the editor of the Economist, Zanny Minton-Beddoes, while US treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin is under pressure not to go. Watch this space for more. The rise in oil prices is gathering pace too. Brent futures are up 1.3% to $81.54 a barrel. The sellers are gaining the upper hand in stock markets around Asia Pacific today. Hong Kong and China open later this morning. But this is how it\u2019s looking so far: The Nikkei is now down 1.56%, or 353 points at 22,341 The Kospi is off 12 points, or 0.55% at 2,150 The ASX200 is down 62 points at 5,833, a fall of 1.07% so far Bill Ford, the chief executive of Ford, has become the latest high-profile business leader to pull out of the Future Investment Initiative conference in Riyadh later this month, Reuters reports. He joins JP Morgan boss Jamie Dimon in announcing his withdrawal on Sunday. Neither cited a reason but it is suspected that the diplomatic standoff over the Khashoggi affair would be high on the list. Uber chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi, Viacom boss Bob Bakish and billionaire Steve Case, one of the founders of AOL, have also said they won\u2019t be going to the event dubbed \u201cDavos in the desert\u201d, Reuters said. Bloomberg and CNN have also pulled out of covering the event. Read the full story on the growing row by our diplomatic editor Patrick Wintour: Trading is under way in Japan and Korea. The Nikkei is off 1% and the Kospi is down 0.5% in Seoul. That seems par for the course today given the poor start in Sydney, where it\u2019s now off 0.89% for the day. The question is whether the markets can bounce back or they are dragged lower by a compound of problems ... The price of Brent crude has risen this morning to $80.5 a barrel. It\u2019s surely connected to the Saudi issue, so it\u2019s worth looking again at what the kingdom has said about possibly retaliating to external pressure over the Khashoggi affair. A statement from Riyadh on Sunday said: The kingdom affirms its total rejection of any threats and attempts to undermine it, whether through economic sanctions, political pressure or repeating false accusations. The kingdom also affirms that if it is [targeted by] any action, it will respond with greater action. Crucially, the statement also pointed out that the oil-rich kingdom \u201cplays an effective and vital role in the world economy\u201d. That has to be an implicit threat to cut oil production and push up the price of a barrel, doesn\u2019t it? The standoff between Saudi Arabia and just about everyone else in the world over the disappearance of journalist Jamal Khashoggi looks like intensifying. The Saudis have promised pushback if Donald Trump carries out his threat of \u201csevere Punishment\u201d if the kingdom is found to have disposed of Khashoggi, as alleged by Turkey. Now, Reuters report that JP Morgan Chase chief executive Jamie Dimon has cancelled plans to attend a Saudi Arabian investor conference later this month. The bank did not give any more details for Dimon\u2019s decision not to attend the Future Investment Initiative conference in Riyadh, and did not comment on whether concerns about the disappearance of Khashoggi were a factor. In currencies, the US dollar has gained a bit today. That means the Aussie dollar is down slightly at US71.07 while the yen has slipped to 112.2. The pound is at $1.31. The benchmark ASX200 has slipped around 1% in the first few minutes. The banks, as usual of late, have been sold with the financial sector down 1.47%. Same for resources which are down more than 1% but utilities are off 2%. More commentary on the Australian market from Michael McCarthy at CMC Markets. His thrust is that this week sees a lot of data from China including lending, retail sales and GDP which should give us a picture of where the superpower is heading, ie is it in good enough shape to survive a trade-war inspired downturn? There\u2019s also inflation and trade data from Japan, retail sales in the UK and in the US, retail sales, housing numbers and Fed minutes. Here\u2019s what Michael says: Australian investors face a challenge at this morning\u2019s opening. Despite positive moves for US shares and buoyant industrial commodities SPI futures were belted at the New York close, suffering a 51 point loss for the session. The first hour of trading may indicate whether this was an error or the beginning of further underperformance for Australian shares. Greg McKenna, the independent market strategist, says the markets narrative has been hijacked by the Saudi pushback and Brexit but reckons it\u2019s a close call on what direction things will take. This is what he says in his morning note: Much water to flow here especially for the Pound and oil prices. Looking back to Friday though and while stocks in the US rallied into the close it was a messy day and hardly a convincing bounce. Is it the bottom? Many think so and the medium-term charts recovered to hold channel bottoms. But we\u2019ll see. Good morning and welcome to the Guardian business live blog. We\u2019re firing up a bit earlier than usual today because it looks like being an interesting session in Asia Pacific markets. In Australia, the ASX200 has dropped 51 points after opening a few minutes, or just under 1%. The Nikkei in Japan in expected to fall 0.83% and the Hang Seng will also dip slightly. China\u2019s CSI300 is set for a bounce though. That\u2019s only part of the picture today though because Saudi Arabia\u2019s threat to disrupt the global economy will likely send the oil price higher today. Stocks on the Saudi market fell on Sunday. Meanwhile, the Brexit talks in the UK remain very tense with questions about whether Theresa May\u2019s government can seal a deal on its backstop solution for the Irish border. Senior members of her Tory party are threatening to rebel over the matter and that has seen the pound drop substantially. It\u2019s buying $1.309 \u2013 down more than 1% on Friday\u2019s close. A forecast showing that the UK economy is going to have its worst year since the financial crisis hasn\u2019t helped.",

      "bodyText": "The US carmaker Ford has described a no-deal Brexit as a \u201cred line\u201d that would force it to reconsider the scale of its presence in Britain in a dramatic reversal of an earlier commitment to stay put. Ford issued the warning on the same day as the pharmaceuticals company AstraZeneca and the carmaker Nissan said the prospect of a hard Brexit was already disrupting their businesses. The interventions, from firms employing nearly 30,000 people between them in the UK, offered a timely reminder of the anxiety within British industry as Theresa May revealed that talks with Brussels had reached an impasse over arrangements for the border in Northern Ireland. Ford\u2019s European boss, Steven Armstrong, said: \u201cFor Ford, a hard Brexit is a red line. It could severely damage the UK\u2019s competitiveness and result in a significant threat to much of the auto industry, including our own UK manufacturing operations.\u201d The US auto firm employs 14,000 people in the UK, including 3,000 making engines in Dagenham in Essex and 1,950 at a plant in Bridgend, south Wales. \u201cWhile we think this is a worst-case scenario and that a UK-EU deal will be reached, we will take whatever action is necessary to protect our business in the event of a hard Brexit,\u201d Armstrong told the BBC. He rubbished the Canada-style trade deal championed by Brexiters such as Jacob Rees-Mogg, saying existing arrangements between the EU and Canada involved time-consuming customs and border checks. \u201cIf this was introduced for all UK-EU trade, the level of congestion and blockages at the ports would undermine our just-in-time manufacturing system,\u201d he said. Armstrong\u2019s comments, a change of stance from Ford\u2019s vow in April to remain in the UK whatever the outcome of Brexit talks, echo similar sentiments among carmakers such as Toyota, Jaguar Land Rover and BMW. Nissan, which has previously warned of \u201cserious implications\u201d from a no-deal scenario, said on Monday that it had postponed pay talks with staff until it knew more about the Brexit deal. The firm, which employs about 8,000 people in the UK, was due to begin thrashing out a two-year wage deal this autumn. \u201cIn agreement with our employee representatives, the 2019-2020 pay negotiations in our UK plant and technical centre will commence in 2019 when we have better clarity on the future business outlook,\u201d said a spokesperson. Nissan built nearly one in three of Britain\u2019s 1.67m new cars last year at its Sunderland plant. Drugmaker AstraZeneca\u2019s chairman said it had put investment in manufacturing on hold owing to confusion about the ease with which medicines will be able to flow between the UK and the European Union. In an interview with the French newspaper Le Monde, Leif Johansson said preparations for Brexit, which include stockpiling medicines and spending \u00a340m to build laboratories outside the UK, were distracting the company from day-to-day business. He confirmed plans revealed by the Cambridge-based company last year to suspend investment in manufacturing in the UK. \u201cIf a transition deal does not make clear what will happen in the future, we will maintain our decision not to invest,\u201d he said. The postponement is because of concern that gridlock in cross-border movement of medicines will reduce sales to the continent, limiting the need for more manufacturing capacity at its plant in Macclesfield, Cheshire. AstraZeneca has a team of 30 people, out of a 7,000-strong UK workforce, dedicated exclusively to Brexit preparations. \u201cI spend between a fifth and a quarter of my time on it,\u201d Johansson said. \u201cIt is very rare that we have a board meeting that does not mention it. \u201cIn business, we are often forced to act amid uncertainty, this kind of thing happens. But the frustrating thing is to do it while what currently exists works very well. It costs us money and it does not bring us any benefit.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The hoped-for soft landing of the Australian housing market took another hit with the release of the latest housing finance data showing the biggest annual fall in housing finance commitments for nearly eight years. Both the Reserve Bank and the International Monetary Fund have recently pointed to concerns about the level of household debt as we reach a decade since the global financial crisis. Ten years ago in October 2008, the Reserve Bank hit the panic button. It cut the cash rate by 100 basis points, just a month after it had lowered it by 25 basis points. It wasn\u2019t finished. The following month it cut another 75 basis points, and then in December yet another 100 basis points were dropped, only to be repeated in February 2009, before the final 25 basis point cut occurred in April. All up the cash rate was now 3.25% points lower than it had been just seven months prior. Even more astonishing for us now, removed as we are from those heady days, is that this meant the cash rate in April 2009 was 3.00% \u2013 double what it is now. For anyone who was left breathless at the crisis-level interest rates, probably the only thing more surprising than the speed at which interest rates had been cut would be to learn that within a decade the cash rate would be at 1.5%, and that while the economy was growing solidly, housing finance would be collapsing. And yet that is where we are at. In October, the ABS calculates that total value of housing finance commitments was 9.9% below what is was 12 months ago \u2013 the biggest 12-month fall since December 2010 in trend terms. The fall in investor housing financing commitments was 17.7%, but it would be wrong to suggest the drop was all due to investors \u2013 owner-occupier financing is down 3.6%: Sometimes the trend figures can be a bit too slow to show changes in the market, but even the more erratic seasonally adjusted figures provide no relief \u2013 down 2.7% in the month of October alone and down 13.6% over the past 12 months: While the fall in investor lending is not too surprising given the tightening of limits on such loans, the fall in owner-occupier housing reflects a concern that is greater than just investors not believing they will be able to make either a capital gain or negative gearing benefit from a rental property. The number of owner-occupier loans taken out in October was 10.5% below that of 12 months prior \u2013 the biggest fall since February 2011: This all suggests that housing price growth will continue to fall for the next six months at least, especially as the drop in housing finance commitments is quite widespread across most states: And that brings worries about the stability of our financial sector due to the record levels of debt held by Australian households. The Reserve Bank pointed to this in its latest Financial Stability Review, in which it noted that \u201cnotwithstanding the recent moderation in the growth of debt and change in its composition, households\u2019 high outstanding stock of debt remains a concern. Households with a high debt burden could cut back on their spending if economic conditions were to deteriorate.\u201d In June the value of Australian household debt reached a record level of 190% of household disposable income: The RBA noted that while for the most part the value of a household\u2019s assets was greater than its debt, \u201cfor most households, almost all of their wealth is in relatively illiquid assets, such as housing and superannuation.\u201d This makes for difficulty in selling assts to make repayments should the economy turn bad and unemployment rise. The RBA suggests that \u201cat present, households in aggregate appear well placed to manage their debt repayments\u201d but it notes that \u201creliable and relatively timely indicators point to pockets of household financial stress, but this is not widespread.\u201d The IMF is perhaps a bit more worried about household debt levels than the RBA, notwithstanding its relatively upbeat outlook for Australia\u2019s economy. In its latest World Economic Outlook, the IMF improved its predictions for Australia\u2019s GDP growth this year, but revised down predictions for growth in 2019 and 2020: The blame for this downward revision can be placed on Donald Trump. The IMF noted that \u201cthe downward revisions to the 2019 growth forecast for Australia and Korea \u2026 partially reflect the negative effect of the recently introduced trade measures\u201d \u2013 ie the tariff battle started by Trump with China, Canada and Europe. But the IMF still sees our unemployment rate falling below 5% within the next two years \u2013 indeed it has a more positive outlook than did the Treasury in the May budget. Given Treasury advises the IMF on its projections it will be interesting to see if the December mid-year economic and fiscal outlook has a more upbeat outlook: But the IMF also released its latest Global Financial Stability Report, which specifically mentioned Australia along with Canada and the Nordic countries as places where \u201cthe ratio of household debt to GDP\u201d was \u201con an upward trajectory\u201d and which stood out \u201cas a key area of concern\u201d. And it noted alone that Australian \u201chouse prices have started to reverse course in major cities and nationwide since late 2017\u201d. With interest rates at record lows, it is always worth remembering that while the government may be boasting of retuning the budget to surplus, and is thus slowing the economy, the RBA still has its foot on the economic accelerator. And yet the ability for the current level of low interest rates to increase economic activity appears to have worn off. For the most part that is not a concern. The government is returning to surplus, but also appears likely to keep spending as we enter election season, meaning austerity is very much on the backburner. But as the IMF notes, the risk from international economic headwinds remains paramount \u2013 especially should the US-China-Europe trade battle turn into a war. And then we will find our households with record debt and little room for the Reserve Bank to cut rates \u2013 and certainly nowhere near like they were able a decade ago. \u2022 Greg Jericho is a Guardian Australia columnist",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Keith Potter (Letters, 6 October) is right. Cornwall is beautiful but like many rural locations it is no place to wear rose-tinted glasses. I visited post offices in rural south-east Cornwall just four weeks ago. I understand how much people there rely on our services and I saw how committed post office colleagues are \u2013 to meet the needs of those customers. My letter of 26 September still stands: post offices provide great service in communities across the UK. If Mr Potter gets in touch, we will look into the issues he raises. We can usually improve things locally when we work with people who share our passion for the Post Office. Paula Vennells Group CEO, Post Office Ltd \u2022 Keith Potter\u2019s view of the way post offices are managed is correct. Most of the postmasters I meet and work for say the same . In many cases they state that the payments from Post Office Ltd do not cover the work they perform for the company; on a good day it could reach about \u00a33 per hour, and because they are self-employed the minimum wage is not a consideration. At interview for new postmasters they tell me that a rosy picture is painted by the interviewers which does not live up to the reality of the job, and the many hours of work that have to be put in to try and make post office work viable. Add to this the deliberately managed decline of the network, no innovative schemes such as access to the internet for the elderly and other people without these skills (especially in rural areas), lack of interest by the government which could give them a kick up the backside , and the future \u2013 or lack of it \u2013 looks bleak. Relief postmaster (Name and address supplied) \u2022 I run two post offices in Swansea, one as a main branch and another as a local branch. Both are located inside convenience stores. I totally agree with the points raised by Keith Potter. My main office closes at 6.30pm every weekday of the week and 5.30pm over the weekends. We would love to open till 8pm or 9pm as the shop is open late \u2013 but it is not safe to keep it open after 6.30pm with only one person and post office remuneration is not enough to employ additional staff even at minimum wage. Worse, the Post Office Horizon computer system sends wrong information to its central servers, which means we often do not receive enough cash. We pay out lot of money in pensions and benefits every week, and when the cash runs out, customers suffer \u2013 especially the elderly. Every single week, I spend 15-20 minutes twice a week on call-waiting with the Post Office cash centre trying to get more cash for the branch. My second office is a local branch, which closes at 5.30pm on weekdays and 1pm on Saturdays and is not open on Sundays. My father-in-law works at the shop in the evenings and weekends and I cannot afford pay another member of staff just to work at the post office. Post office remuneration works out to be less than the minimum wage for the hours we put in weekly. I\u2019ve been with Post Office Ltd for more than six years and during that time everything seems to have gone downhill. I seen many staff who work directly for POL lose their jobs. In the local cash delivery office, they cut down from 29 employees to just 10. A friend who used to run five post offices has sold three and is looking to sell the others. If POL doesn\u2019t improve the remuneration for sub-postmasters, I can only see more closures and limited services. T Karan Birchgrove, Swansea \u2022 I am proud to be the sub-postmaster of Ashburton post office in Devon. Thousands of sub-postmasters across the UK are working extremely hard to give customers great service, sustain the branches, provide employment and play a significant part in supporting our high streets, towns, villages and communities. Excellent customer service is key \u2013 and thousands of colleagues make a difference to so many people every minute of the trading day. In some cases, a conversation with a branch colleague maybe the only interaction a vulnerable customer has that day. Please give post offices a chance. Promoting the great service and thousands of unsung heroes who make a positive difference every day does make a difference to sustaining our communities. Stuart Rogers Ashburton, Devon \u2022 My wife and I operate a tiny rural post office branch in Yalding in Kent. Our branch, although tiny, is bright and welcoming. But I do have some sympathy with the person who describes some branches as rather grotty. Post Office Ltd has made it almost impossible for people to operate little post offices by forever cutting remuneration rates \u2013 and government subsidy removal for most branches is making it harder to stay in business. To make a living operating a post office the branch has to be within a much larger premises such as a supermarket, convenience shop, garage shop, WH Smith, etc. What generally happens is that the post office bit of the business is a minor player on the income side and is shunted off to a distant corner. We have many customers forever complaining of indifferent service in run-down larger shops and, whatever POL says about longer opening hours, customers prefer friendly small branches. In our area we have had several branches close down with nearby convenience stores being offered the chance to bring the branch into their shops. The convenience stores locally have refused the offer as it increases their wage costs disproportionately to the extra business it might create.

      "body": "<p>Keith Potter (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/oct/05/ceos-rose-tinted-view-of-post-offices\" title=\"\">Letters</a>, 6 October) is right. Cornwall is beautiful but like many rural locations it is no place to wear rose-tinted glasses. I visited post offices in rural south-east Cornwall just four weeks ago. I understand how much people there rely on our services and I saw how committed post office colleagues are \u2013 to meet the needs of those customers.</p> <p>My <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/sep/25/post-offices-offer-a-first-class-experience\" title=\"\">letter of 26 September</a> still stands: post offices provide great service in communities across the UK. If Mr Potter gets in touch, we will look into the issues he raises. We can usually improve things locally when we work with people who share our passion for the Post Office.<br><strong>Paula Vennells</strong><br><em>Group CEO, Post Office Ltd</em></p> <p>\u2022<em> </em>Keith Potter\u2019s view of the way post offices are managed is correct. Most of the postmasters I meet and work for say the same . In many cases they state that the payments from Post Office Ltd do not cover the work they perform for the company; on a good day it could reach about \u00a33 per hour, and because they are self-employed the minimum wage is not a consideration.</p> <p>At interview for new postmasters they tell me that a rosy picture is painted by the interviewers which does not live up to the reality of the job, and the many hours of work that have to be put in to try and make post office work viable.</p> <p>Add to this the deliberately managed decline of the network, no innovative schemes such as access to the internet for the elderly and other people without these skills (especially in rural areas), lack of interest by the government which could give them a kick up the backside , and the future \u2013 or lack of it \u2013 looks bleak.<br><strong>Relief postmaster</strong><br><em>(Name and address supplied) </em></p> <p><em> </em></p> <p>\u2022<em> </em>I run two post offices in Swansea, one as a main branch and another as a local branch. Both are located inside convenience stores. I totally agree with the points raised by Keith Potter.</p> <p>My main office closes at 6.30pm every weekday of the week and 5.30pm over the weekends. We would love to open till 8pm or 9pm as the shop is open late \u2013 but it is not safe to keep it open after 6.30pm with only one person and post office remuneration is not enough to employ additional staff even at minimum wage. Worse, the Post Office Horizon computer system sends wrong information to its central servers, which means we often do not receive enough cash. We pay out lot of money in pensions and benefits every week, and when the cash runs out, customers suffer \u2013 especially the elderly.

      "bodyText": "\u201cI don\u2019t understand the point of Sears, I just buy everything online,\u201d said 23-year-old Lyft driver Shannon Dickey as we pull up to the abandoned storefront of Sears that sits at the top of Ross Park Mall, nine miles north of downtown Pittsburgh \u201cI think their old catalogs are cool, but I just don\u2019t understand the point of Sears.\u201d Founded in 1893, Sears was once a staple of the American lifestyle. Now after 125 years in business, the quintessential American brand has filed for bankruptcy, an announcement that came Monday, unable to pay its debts.. In the past year, Sears has already shuttered its last three remaining marquee stores in Pittsburgh. Now, all that remains is a rundown Sears outlet warehouse store scattered along the railroad tracks in an industrial neighborhood alongside the Allegheny River in Lawrenceville. The so-called \u201cScratch &amp; Dent Sears\u201d outlet sells slightly defective washers, dryers and other goods, appliances that can still be purchased with Sears\u2019 trademark warranty, and on credit in monthly installments. For generations, Sears served the middle market of working-class homeowners hoping to buy high-quality products, but who could not afford to make the purchases outright without Sears monthly installment programs. \u201cNobody offers payment plans now because they don\u2019t trust nobody,\u201d said Bob, a 15-year employee of the Sears outlet store as he helps his friend load a La-Z-Boy chair into his truck. That said, Bob warned Sears was not to be messed with if buyers don\u2019t meet the monthly payments. \u201cSears will come in your house though and take that shit back if they want to. Sears ain\u2019t like the rest of them, they gonna come steal that shit.\u201d However, with the rise of Amazon, the advent of discount shopping on the internet and competition from stores like Walmart, Sears\u2019 target audience has drifted elsewhere. \u201cI feel upset because I like Sears,\u201d says Mark Vesei, who signed up for a store credit card. Vesei regularly buys tools for his auto detail business in the nearby neighborhood of Swissvale. Sears tools gained a great reputation among craftsmen like Vesei who saw them as being dependable. \u201cI used to come to Sears with my dad back in the day because of the Sears Craftsman lifetime guarantee,\u201d said Trevor Thomas as he picked up a refrigerator he purchased at the store\u2019s Columbus Day sale. The 125-year-old department store operator was once the world\u2019s largest retailer. It has been controlled by hedge fund billionaire Eddie Lampert for some 13 years. Lampert has slashed costs, cut stores and lost millions trying to turn the company around. Sears merged with Kmart in 2004, at which point the holding company had more than 3,500 locations. About 250 of its best-performing stores were spun off into a new company, Seritage, while others were sold or closed, leaving Sears managing around 700 locations, many within struggling shopping malls that face the prospect of another \u201cdark anchor\u201d \u2013 a shuttered major store \u2013 if their Sears closes. It last made a profit in 2011 and losses now top $11bn. Under the bankruptcy plan another 200 stores will close this year, costing thousands their jobs. The company currently employs 70,000 people and has shed 200,000 jobs since 2007. Store employee Bob saw one upside to Sears\u2019 failure. \u201cWhen I saw it on the news, I was like \u2018they aren\u2019t gonna be no more jobs for me tomorrow,\u2019\u201d said Bob. \u201cThen I was like, \u2018let me go buy this chair.\u2019 It\u2019s $100, you can\u2019t beat that.\u201d",

It will be printed on thin, flexible plastic polymer material after the Turner \u00a320 note is issued in 2020, the Bank of England said on Saturday. The last crop of \u00a350s was introduced in 2011 and the note\u2019s future was uncertain after concerns were raised about it being used for money laundering and tax evasion. The Treasury said the next batch would be much harder to forge. A decision over whose image will appear the note will be made after suggestions from members of the public. First introduced in 1981, there are 330m \u00a350 notes in circulation with a combined value of \u00a316.5bn, the Treasury said. The exchequer secretary to the Treasury, Robert Jenrick, said: \u201cOur coins and notes are respected and recognised the world over and are a key part of the UK\u2019s heritage and identity. \u201cPeople should have as much choice as possible when it comes to their money, and we\u2019re making sure that cash is here to stay. Our money needs to be secure and this new note will help prevent crime.\u201d The Bank of England ignored calls last year from animal rights activists to ditch polymer notes that contain traces of animal fat. The Bank said polymer is cleaner and more durable. It allows extra security features to be added. Polymer notes last about 2.5 times longer than paper notes, the Bank said. The notes, however, take longer to biodegrade. The European Central Bank said in May 2016 that it would phase out the \u20ac500 note, nicknamed the Bin Laden because of its association with money laundering and the financing of terrorism. The ECB said the fuchsia-coloured bills, the highest denomination of the eurozone\u2019s seven banknotes, would no longer be printed or distributed from 2018 as they were used too often to finance crime. This article was amended on 15 October 2018 to correct a sub-heading that described the new note as the UK\u2019s highest denomination banknote; three banks in Scotland publish sterling bank notes in denominations of \u00a3100.",

      "bodyText": "Superdry has been hit by this summer\u2019s heatwave and the warm autumn weather, forcing the fashion chain known for its branded tops to issue a profit warning, sending its shares sharply lower. The company struggled to sell sweatshirts and jackets, which account for 45% of its annual sales, because of the \u201cunseasonably hot weather\u201d in the UK, continental Europe and on the east coast of the US. Superdry, which shot to prominence when David Beckham wore one of its Osaka 6 T-shirts on the cover of his 2005 calendar, said the impact of the weather combined with difficult high street conditions would reduce profits up to the end of April 2019 by \u00a310m. It also warned that its hedging against currency movements had not worked out as expected, leading to \u00a38m in additional costs. Before the profit warning, analysts were forecasting underlying pre-tax profits of \u00a3107.1m to \u00a3111.6m. To reduce its reliance on warm outerwear, Superdry is trying to sell more dresses, skirts, women\u2019s tops and denim as well as tapping into the athleisure trend by opening a handful of stores that only sell sportswear. It is investing \u00a35m in digitisation, automation and product development, in a bid to \u201cadapt stores for a digital world\u201d. Superdry has 246 stores, including 102 in the UK. The Superdry chief executive, Euan Sutherland, said: \u201cWe are not immune to the challenges presented by this extraordinary period of unseasonably hot weather. We are well prepared for peak trading but the second half of financial year 2019 presents both risks and opportunities.\u201d Superdry shares tumbled almost 20% to 820p, less than half the level they were trading at in early January, when they peaked at \u00a320.49. Julian Dunkerton, who co-founded the clothing chain with James Holder in 2003, sold \u00a318m of shares in January, at \u00a317.80 a share, followed by another sale of \u00a371m of shares in July, at \u00a312.85 a share. Dunkerton retains a stake of 18.5%. He left the company\u2019s board in May, when he transferred \u00a31.2m in shares to a charity, the Blue Marine Foundation. A year ago the two multimillionaire founders launched a bonus scheme to share their share price gains with Superdry\u2019s 4,500 employees. However, the shares have to hit \u00a323 for the scheme to pay out its \u00a330m bonus to staff. In August, Dunkerton gave \u00a31m to the People\u2019s Vote campaign, which is calling for a referendum on the final Brexit deal, and said that if the UK had left the EU 20 years earlier his brand would never have been a success.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Royal Mail staff selling their shares on Monday lost about \u00a3850 each after a profit warning a fortnight ago sparked a sharp fall in the share price. About 140,000 postal staff have been waiting to sell the free shares they received when the company was privatised five years ago. Monday was the first day they could sell without paying tax or national insurance. The shares have lost nearly 30% of their value since Royal Mail shocked the City with a profit warning on 1 October and are now trading at 338p, just above the flotation price of 330p. They were standing at 477p before the profits warning, compared with a peak of 631p reached in May. Postal workers were awarded 613 shares when the company floated in 2013. Most employees held on to them to avoid the tax bill that selling before the fifth anniversary would have triggered. Those shares were worth \u00a32,072 on Monday, compared with \u00a32,924 before the profit warning. The profit warning came just days after management wrote to employees asking them if they wanted to pre-register to sell their shares on Monday. Some Royal Mail staff have accused the company of deliberately issuing a profit warning less than a fortnight before many were planning to sell their holdings. Des Arthur, a postman from Coventry, told the BBC the timing of the profit warning \u201ccould be viewed as extremely cynical\u201d. The company said it understood employees\u2019 disappointment but added that it had no choice but to update the market on 1 October. Under stock market rules, UK companies have to notify the market without delay of any changes in their trading performance that could lead to a substantial share price movement. Royal Mail said that anyone who pre-registered to sell their shares before that date was able to cancel the sale. Some employees said the fall in the share price had forced them to cancel holidays and disrupted other spending plans or debt repayments. Mike Beckerleg, a postal worker in Cornwall, said earlier this month that Royal Mail staff had suffered \u201ca considerable loss\u201d. Some said they would hold on to their shares in the hope that the price would go up again.

      "bodyText": "Sears, the 125-year-old US department store chain that was once the biggest retailer in the world, has filed for bankruptcy after years of losses and mounting competition from online rivals such as Amazon. The company, which owns the discount chain Kmart, has filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy in New York as it struggles with a debt burden of $5.6bn (\u00a34.3bn) and was unable to make a $134m repayment due on Monday. The move will give Sears time to reorganise its debts and allow it to keep most of its stores open through the holidays, in a bid to avoid outright liquidation. It will receive $300m from its lenders and is negotiating a further $300m injection from a hedge fund owned by the company\u2019s chairman and biggest shareholder and creditor, Eddie Lampert. The company, which has about 700 stores, will shut a further 142 by the end of the year, with liquidation sales expected to start shortly, following 46 recently announced store closures. The Sears workforce has dwindled to about 70,000 from 300,000 a decade ago as the firm closed more than 1,000 stores. Once a symbol of the American lifestyle that prided itself on selling everything to everyone, Sears has been losing out to rival retailers Walmart and Amazon. Since it merged with Kmart in 2005, the company has been run by the billionaire hedge fund manager Lampert, who sold off many of the firm\u2019s brands and properties but failed to win back customers, many of whom now prefer to shop online. Lampert stepped down as chief executive on Monday but remains chairman. Lampert\u2019s hedge fund is considering buying a \u201clarge portion\u201d of the Sears stores out of bankruptcy, the company said. Lampert believes the company can reorganise about 300 of the most profitable stores, according to the Wall Street Journal. \u201cThe company believes that a successful reorganisation will save the company and the jobs of tens of thousands of store associates,\u201d Sears said. For generations, Sears served working-class homeowners hoping to buy high-quality products by offering them monthly instalment programmes. It started out as a vast mail-order business selling clothes, tools, toys and even tombstones, cocaine and opium, and became the biggest retailer in the US before being overtaken by Walmart in the 1980s, and later Amazon. Neil Saunders, the managing director of the research firm GlobalData Retail, pointed to \u201cmanagement\u2019s failure to understand retail and evolve Sears in a way that would have given the chain a fair chance of survival\u201d. He added: \u201cAlthough the present leadership team needs to shoulder much of the responsibility, the missteps arguably go back to the 1980s when Sears became too diversified and lost the deftness that had once made it the world\u2019s largest and most innovative retailer.\u201d",

Rightmove, the UK\u2019s biggest property website, said a less active buy-to-let market had led properties with two bedrooms or fewer to drop 0.1% in price last month. Subdued prices provide first-time buyers with an \u201copportunity this autumn\u201d, it said. First-time buyers are now paying an average of \u00a3190,000 for their home, compared with \u00a3307,000 across the whole market, it said Meanwhile, the upmarket estate agents Hampton International produced figures showing that money spent on buy-to-let purchases across the UK is currently 30% below what it was in 2015. The 3% stamp duty surcharge faced by purchasers of second homes, and changes to the way buy-to-let income is taxed, appear to have reduced the appeal of the sector, which expanded rapidly after 2008. At the height of the buy-to-let boom, those first-time buyers who were able to get a 10% deposit together frequently found themselves outbid by buy-to-let landlords. In London, landlords spent \u00a33.5bn in the first half of this year buying rental homes, said Hamptons, 40% down on the same period of 2015. Rightmove said mortgage approvals for new buy-to-let purchases are 14% down on a year ago and 53% down on three years ago as a more punitive tax regime has had \u201cits desired effect\u201d. While asking prices traditionally rise in October, it said this year\u2019s 1% increase in average asking prices across the country is the lowest since 2010. Rightmove\u2019s Miles Shipside said: \u201cLandlords are clearly buying far fewer properties and that leaves a gap in the market for first-time buyers.\u201d They were effectively awarded stamp duty-free status in November 2017, Shipside said, adding: \u201cThe fall in prices gives an opportunity for those stamp duty-free first-time buyers to negotiate harder.\u201d Markets in London and the north-east are currently the most sluggish, according to Rightmove. Properties in both areas are taking in excess of 70 days to sell. Scotland remains the perkiest market, with properties shifting after an average of 44 days. Last week, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) said Brexit uncertainty had crushed confidence in the property market. Overall prices are 1% down in the capital compared with a year ago, but still stand at \u00a3625,000 or \u00a31.35m in central London. The north-east remains the UK\u2019s cheapest region with an average asking price of \u00a3150,000, said Rightmove. Aneisha Beveridge, head of research at Hamptons International, said the average price of a property bought as a buy-to-let had fallen by 7% since 2016.",

      "bodyText": "European rules designed to make it harder for wealthy individuals and companies to hide their cash offshore have loopholes that mean foreign accounts can be kept secret from tax collectors, a report has warned. Countries in the EU have exchanged financial information about accounts held by overseas residents since the introduction of the \u201ccommon reporting standard\u201d in 2017, designed to reduce tax evasion. Information on offshore holdings is sent to the country where the account owner is registered as resident, where authorities can then ensure the money is appropriately taxed. Information is also shared with and by low-tax jurisdictions such as the Cayman Islands. But while the rules make it easier for countries to see what money is owed, wealthy investors and companies can use loopholes, according to the report by the European Green party, shared with the Guardian. One problem is that not all countries are taking part in the exercise; the US is one of the key players missing. It has committed to sending partial information, but individuals can still hide their identities behind companies. Austria and Bulgaria do not receive information from the US, the report said, and as of June 2018, at least 43 countries were not committed to implementing the common reporting standard, including Montenegro, Serbia and Ukraine. The report said the easiest way for an EU citizen or company to avoid the automatic exchange of information was to set up bank accounts in one of these countries or in the US using a company name. Another loophole involved countries that offer so-called golden visas to wealthy investors who commit large sums of money in exchange for citizenship. In a scenario set out in the report, someone living in Italy could buy citizenship in Cyprus, which has agreements to receive information from only 33 jurisdictions in or related to the EU. Any account the person opened in a country that fell outside that arrangement would in effect remain invisible. Additionally, there are no sanctions for tax havens that fail to send the relevant information to EU countries, and the rules apply only to financial holdings and not to other assets someone may own overseas. Other rules introduced to make countries tell each other about cross-border tax agreements with companies also needed changing, the report said, so that the details were made public and included all rulings involving multinationals. Sven Giegold, a German MEP and member of the European Green party, said: \u201cThe automatic exchange of information is great progress against tax evasion. Now Europe has to close these loopholes so that the end of tax havens will not become an empty promise.\u201d The report called for the European commission to revise the rules so all financial centres and tax havens are forced to share information with member states, with the risk of sanctions if they do not. It also suggested that the EU could ensure that any advice or request to transfer money to the US be considered as an avoidance scheme until it shares as much information as required by the common reporting standard.",

      "bodyText": "A mining company that operates next to an Indigenous-owned station targeted by racist, pro-mining signs has been fined $40,000 for breaching mining conditions. Melbourne-based Hawthorn Resources was ordered to pay the fine last month after being cautioned by the Western Australian government to control dust levels at the Anglo Saxon/Trouser Legs goldmine, about 145km north-east of Kalgoorlie. The mine is within a few hundred metres of Pinjin station, which is run by Wongatha elders and traditional owners Leo and Lawrence Thomas. The Thomas brothers have been complaining about excessive dust at the site since 2015, and have also alleged a number of other breaches of mining conditions including clogging existing waterways, failing to clean rubbish on the site and failing to cap drill holes. In June racist signs saying \u201cBlack nigars holding up mine\u201d were placed around the Pinjin community, prompting a police investigation. Hawthorn Resources said neither it nor its employees were responsible. That incident and other complaints are subject to a parliamentary inquiry. The WA government told parliament that the Department of Mines, Industry Regulation and Safety (DMIRS) recommended a fine in lieu of asking the company to forfeit its mining tenement. \u201cSection 97 of the Mining Act 1978 permits the minister to impose a penalty of up to $150,000 on a company for a breach of tenement condition,\u201d Labor MP Darren West said, in response to a question from One Nation MP Robin Scott. The question was directed at Bill Johnston but answered on his behalf by West in the legislative council. \u201cBased on the information provided to the minister by DMIRS, which included factors that led to the breach, the minister chose to impose a penalty of $40,000,\u201d West said. The company has also been fined $388.18 for paying royalties one day late. The state\u2019s resources minister, Alannah MacTiernan, told parliament in August the department had written to Hawthorn resources three times in the previous 12 months. Two of those letters referred to the amount of dust being created, which is regulated under condition 21 of the mining licence. MacTiernan said the company had no outstanding royalty debt as of August this year. Hawthorn Resources has been contacted for comment.",
