      "bodyText": "Rupert Murdoch swooped in with an \u00a311.2bn offer to take full control of the satellite broadcaster Sky, five years after he was forced to abandon a similar deal amid public revulsion over the phone-hacking scandal. The media mogul\u2019s 21st Century Fox film and television group said it had reached an agreement in principle to buy Sky, which would bring together the company behind Fox News with the largest pay-TV broadcaster in Britain to create the most powerful media group in the UK. Labour and Liberal Democrat politicians said the government had to intervene and demanded an inquiry on the grounds of public interest. Fox owns the controversial rightwing Fox News network in the US, while Sky News is a politically neutral service in competition with the BBC and ITV news. Completing the deal, which values all of Sky at \u00a318.5bn, would represent a long-held ambition for Murdoch and his son James, the chief executive of 21st Century Fox. Murdoch already owns 39% of Sky but was forced to abandon an attempt to take full control in 2011 after it emerged that journalists at the News of the World had hacked the phone of the murdered teenager Milly Dowler. If the negotiations between the two companies lead to a definitive takeover offer being accepted, competition authorities must be notified and the secretary of state for culture, media and sport, Karen Bradley, will have to decide whether to ask the media regulator, Ofcom, to carry out a public interest test. Tom Watson, Labour\u2019s deputy leader and shadow culture secretary, warned of the \u201clikely concentration of further media power in the hands of a single company\u201d and said it would be incumbent on Ofcom and other competition authorities to ensure media plurality was upheld in the UK if the takeover proceeded. \u201cThe bid must also be judged on its likely impact on the UK news market and the provision of robust and independent journalism,\u201d he said. Vince Cable, the former Lib Dem business secretary, said the proposed takeover was a test of the government\u2019s independence from large media owners. When Cable was in government he referred Murdoch\u2019s previous bid to a public interest test in 2010. He said on Friday that the market situation had not changed since. \u201cThe level of plurality in UK media has remained comparable since I referred a similar takeover bid to the competitions authorities in 2010. Nothing seems to have materially changed and if this takeover was to go ahead then there would be similar concerns raised about media plurality in the UK,\u201d he said. \u201cThe way Theresa May\u2019s government deals with this is a test of their independence from the influence of large proprietors. The consultation that has been launched on the implementation of Leveson would suggest there is a tendency for some to bow to the power of media giants \u2013 this must not be the case.\u201d If the government does refer the deal to Ofcom, company insiders say 21st Century Fox believes it is in a better position to clear any regulatory hurdles than Murdoch\u2019s previous bid. This, they say, is because the mogul\u2019s newspapers, including the Sun and the Times, have been spun off into a separate company, News Corp, since the hacking scandal. They also argue that the UK media landscape has become more fragmented. Rupert Murdoch founded Sky in 1989 but after an initial financial crisis, the company was merged with rival satellite broadcaster BSB a year later. Since then the media mogul has retained a substantial stake, but never controlled a majority of its shares. When Cable announced the public interest test for their 2011 bid, the Murdochs had agreed to spin off Sky News into a company with an independent editorial board. But after it emerged that News of the World journalists had hacked into Dowler\u2019s phone, Conservative, Labour and Lib Dem politicians agreed that a takeover could not proceed and the Murdochs withdrew. Claire Enders, a media analyst, said a takeover bid had been inevitable since Brexit, because the falling pound meant Sky was far cheaper to a US company paying in dollars. She said she did not believe Bradley would refer the bid to Ofcom on public interest grounds because the market and company structure had changed. \u201cThe circulation of the newspapers \u2013 now part of an entirely separate company \u2013 have dropped drastically since 2011.\u201d The European commission, which cleared the previous bids, is also likely to look at the new deal. In 2014, Sky took full control of Sky-branded services in Germany, Austria and Italy, meaning any UK takeover has a European dimension that did not exist before. The offer proposed by Fox is priced at \u00a310.75 of cash per share, representing a premium of 40% to Sky\u2019s closing price on 6 December, the last business day before the initial proposal had been received from the US company. Immediately after the news of the proposed deal was announced on the London Stock Exchange, shares in Sky soared nearly 30% to \u00a310.26. Justifying the planned takeover, 21st Century Fox said: \u201cIn the past several years, 21st Century Fox has consistently stated that its existing 39.1% stake in Sky is not a natural end position. \u201cA proposed transaction between 21st Century Fox and Sky would bring together 21st Century Fox\u2019s global content business with Sky\u2019s world-class direct-to-consumer capabilities, which have made it the number one premium pay-TV provider in all its markets. \u201cIt would also enhance Sky\u2019s leading position in entertainment and sport, and reinforce the UK\u2019s standing as a top global hub for content generation and technological innovation.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Why would Rupert Murdoch pounce on Sky now? First, because he was only ever biding his time after the humiliation of the failed bid in 2011. As 21st Century Fox said in its formal announcement, it has long regarded its 39% shareholding as \u201cnot a natural end position\u201d. Second, the fall in sterling after the vote for Brexit has played to Murdoch\u2019s advantage. US bidders for UK assets start with the wind at their back. 21st Century earns its profits in dollars that, in sterling terms, are worth 15% more than they were in June. Third, Sky\u2019s share price has been sliding all year as the City has fretted about competition from BT, Netflix and Amazon. That has created an opening to put a cash offer on the table that is generous by conventional City yardsticks. At \u00a310.75-a-share, Sky would be bagged at a valuation that was seen as recently as February but, critically, the price is 40% higher than this week\u2019s share price. Cash bids at that level of premium tend to succeed, especially when there are no other bidders in town. Sky\u2019s independent directors have already agreed the price is fair, which puts 21st Century Fox in a stronger position than News Corporation in 2011. Back then, the independents said they would not accept less than 800p, but the final haggling over price never happened. Could regulators still intervene and block the deal? It is possible. Since 2011, Sky Italia and Sky Deutschland have been folded into the UK company. That means Brussels, which sometimes springs surprises, especially on US companies, could find a way to get involved. But Murdoch will think he has little to fear from the UK end. News Corp pulled its bid in 2011 after weeks of revelations about phone hacking at the News of the World but he has split his media empire in two since then. The UK newspapers are housed in the company that carries the old News Corp name. This fresh offer comes from 21st Century Fox, the US-listed company that owns a Hollywood studio and the Fox TV network and had nothing to do with phone hacking in the UK. Murdoch has also been around the track on media plurality protections. Back in 2011, Jeremy Hunt, culture secretary at the time, wanted Sky News to be ringfenced to protect its editorial independence. Murdoch was willing to accept that condition at the time and would surely be happy to do so again. He is more interested in ensuring Sky stays in the big league of global media companies as AT&amp;T prepares to buy Time Warner and the newcomers like Netflix and Amazon ramp up their original content. Murdoch will also have noted there was minimal political fuss in the UK when his son James returned as chairman of Sky earlier this year. Outside shareholders in Sky protested at the first opportunity \u2013 a majority either opposed or abstained in October\u2019s vote on the reappointment \u2013 but Westminster barely seemed to notice.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "News that the British broadcaster Sky has agreed an \u00a311.2bn takeover by Rupert Murdoch\u2019s US media group 21st Century Fox reignites one of the most contentious corporate deals of the decade. Five years ago, Murdoch\u2019s News Corp pulled out of a bid for the pay-TV broadcaster in the wake of the phone-hacking scandal. This time, however, the regulatory and political backdrop is less difficult for the 85-year-old media tycoon, whose offer values all of Sky at \u00a318.5bn. Will the UK regulators get involved? Once notified of the deal, the culture secretary, Karen Bradley, will have 10 working days to decide whether to issue a public interest intervention notice, or PIIN. She must specify what concerns, if any, are raised by the transaction. These can include concentration of media power and whether there needs to be a \u201cfit and proper\u201d test to determine whether Fox is committed to standards, such as accuracy and impartial news coverage. If Bradley publishes a PIIN, Ofcom will conduct an initial investigation, reporting back in 40 working days. If there are no concerns, Bradley must clear the bid. If Ofcom raises concerns, however, Bradley must decide whether to accept an undertaking from Fox to address them. For instance, the doomed Murdoch bid for Sky in 2011 resulted in a deal to spin off Sky News. If Bradley rejects any Murdoch-brokered compromise, she can refer it to the Competition Markets Authority for full scrutiny. Should that happen, the competition body has six months to complete its inquiry. After that, Bradley will have 30 days to decide whether to block the deal, waive it through unchecked or rubber stamp it, subject to certain conditions. The big question is whether she will look to issue the PIIN in the first place. Most analysts feel she will have to. Given the level of opposition to the first bid, which resulted in the then culture secretary, Jeremy Hunt, intervening, it could look like she is being partial towards the Fox bid if she doesn\u2019t act. So is the deal likely to be blocked? Last time around, a compromise emerged. In 2010, when News Corp \u2013 then 21st Century Fox\u2019s parent \u2013 announced its bid to take full control of Sky, Ofcom launched an investigation. The regulator was concerned about whether the proposed deal would give Murdoch too much control of media in the UK. As well as a 39% stake in the pay-TV broadcaster, News Corp also owned the Times, Sunday Times and Sun newspapers. In a bid to push through the takeover, News Corp agreed a deal with the government to spin off the loss-making Sky News subsidiary into a new, publicly listed company which would be independently funded for 10 years. Since then, News Corp has split into two different companies comprised of its newspaper assets in one, and its TV and film assets in the other. 21st Century Fox, owner of the Fox TV network and a Hollywood studio, has made the bid for Sky so the company will believe there are no concerns this time about media power being concentrated in too few hands. However, given that the Murdoch family will be the ultimate owner of both newspaper and TV assets in the UK, questions might still be asked. A similar offer to spin off Sky News may still need to be made to appease media plurality issues. Could European regulators block the deal? The original bid to buy the outstanding stake in Sky did not fall foul of competition regulations, because the European commission \u2013 the EU\u2019s executive arm \u2013 gave it the green light. The original European commission investigation looked at the potential combination of Sky UK with its German and Italian operations. It found that such a group was \u201cunlikely\u201d to flex its muscle in an anti-competitive way in areas such as sports and film rights. That scenario has now come to pass anyway. In 2014, Sky struck a near-\u00a37bn deal to buy out its sister operations in Germany and Italy, creating a pan-European operation. European regulators cleared this too, which will buoy Fox\u2019s optimism that a takeover of a newly enlarged Sky will receive EU approval. Could the phone-hacking scandal again derail the deal? In 2011, News Corp was forced to abandon its \u00a38bn-plus bid to take control of Sky after the fallout from the phone-hacking scandal made the transaction politically impossible. An Ofcom investigation found in 2012 that Sky remained a \u201cfit and proper\u201d owner of a broadcast licence, despite the phone-hacking affair that embroiled its parent company, but published a scathing assessment of James Murdoch \u2013 then chairman of Sky \u2013 finding that his conduct repeatedly fell short of the standards expected. The historical issue of phone hacking is unlikely to play a role in the renewed bid. The tainted newspaper operation has been spun off into a separate company from 21st Century Fox. Will Sky News become more like Fox News? The short answer is no. While Murdoch has in the (distant) past made comments that he would like Sky News to be more \u201cFoxified\u201d, he meant it more in the sense that the operation would become as influential and important as his US network. Due to the lack of impartiality laws in the US, Fox News became successful as a rightwing counterpoint to the leftwing/liberal leanings of many rivals. In the UK, however, Ofcom has stringent impartiality rules relating to news and current affairs that all TV companies must adhere to as part of their broadcasting licence. \u2022 This article was amended on 12 December 2016. An earlier version said that if a public interest intervention notice was published Ofcom would conduct an initial investigation and report back in 20 working days; that has been corrected to 40 working days.",

      "body": "<p>News that the British broadcaster <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/09/rupert-murdochs-fox-agrees-deal-to-buy-sky\">Sky has agreed an \u00a311.2bn takeover by Rupert Murdoch\u2019s US media group 21st Century Fox</a> reignites one of the most contentious corporate deals of the decade. Five years ago, Murdoch\u2019s News Corp<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/jul/13/news-corp-pulls-out-of-bskyb-bid?CMP=share_btn_tw\"> pulled out of a bid for the pay-TV broadcaster</a> in the wake of the phone-hacking scandal. This time, however, the regulatory and political backdrop is less difficult for the 85-year-old media tycoon, whose offer values all of Sky at \u00a318.5bn. </p> <h2><strong>Will the UK regulators get involved?</strong></h2> <p>Once notified of the deal, the culture secretary, Karen Bradley, will have 10 working days to decide whether to issue a public interest intervention notice, or PIIN. She must specify what concerns, if any, are raised by the transaction. These can include concentration of media power and whether there needs to be a \u201cfit and proper\u201d test to determine whether Fox is committed to standards, such as accuracy and impartial news coverage. </p> <p>If Bradley publishes a PIIN, Ofcom will conduct an initial investigation, reporting back in 40 working days. If there are no concerns, Bradley must clear the bid. </p> <p>If Ofcom raises concerns, however, Bradley must decide whether to accept an undertaking from Fox to address them. For instance, the doomed Murdoch bid for Sky in 2011 resulted in a deal to spin off Sky News. If Bradley rejects any Murdoch-brokered compromise, she can refer it to the Competition Markets Authority for full scrutiny. </p> <p>Should that happen, the competition body has six months to complete its inquiry. After that, Bradley will have 30 days to decide whether to block the deal, waive it through unchecked or rubber stamp it, subject to certain conditions.</p> <p>The big question is whether she will look to issue the PIIN in the first place. Most analysts feel she will have to. Given the level of opposition to the first bid, which resulted in the then culture secretary, Jeremy Hunt, intervening, it could look like she is being partial towards the Fox bid if she doesn\u2019t act.</p> <h2><strong>So is the deal likely to be blocked?</strong></h2> <p>Last time around, a compromise emerged. In 2010, when News Corp \u2013 then 21st Century Fox\u2019s parent \u2013 announced its bid to take full control of Sky, Ofcom launched an investigation. The regulator was concerned about whether the proposed deal would give Murdoch too much control of media in the UK. As well as a 39% stake in the pay-TV broadcaster, News Corp also owned the Times, Sunday Times and Sun newspapers. <br></p> <p>In a bid to push through the takeover, News Corp <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/mar/03/jeremy-hunt-news-corp-sky-news\">agreed a deal with the government to spin off the loss-making Sky News subsidiary</a> into a new, publicly listed company which would be independently funded for 10 years.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/09/rupert-murdochs-fox-agrees-deal-to-buy-sky\">Rupert Murdoch's Fox agrees deal to buy Sky</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Since then, News Corp has split into two different companies comprised of its newspaper assets in one, and its TV and film assets in the other. 21st Century Fox, owner of the Fox TV network and a Hollywood studio, has made the bid for Sky so the company will believe there are no concerns this time about media power being concentrated in too few hands.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>However, given that the Murdoch family will be the ultimate owner of both newspaper and TV assets in the UK, questions might still be asked.

Here is what you need to know. Why is Monte dei Paschi di Siena in trouble? The world\u2019s oldest bank has become the focus of the market\u2019s concerns about the health of the Italian banking sector, which is weighed down by \u20ac360bn (\u00a3305bn) of bad debts. Monte dei Paschi was the weakest performer in the annual health checks performed on 51 EU banks in July. The European Banking Authority found its capital base would be wiped out if the global economy and financial markets came under strain and it was instructed to take preemptive action to bolster its financial strength. Why did it need an extension from the European Central Bank? The European Central Bank issued MPS with a deadline of the end of the year to implement a plan to make it more resilient. The Wall Street bank JP Morgan has been leading efforts to revive the bank by spinning out problem loans and raising \u20ac5bn from investors. It was always going to be a race against time, especially as the sum being raised is almost 10 times its current stock market value. So what\u2019s gone wrong? The result of the Italian referendum on Sunday made the task even harder. The resignation of Matteo Renzi \u2013 credited with efforts to clean up Italy\u2019s banks \u2013 has caused fresh political uncertainty. Investors in Italy are accustomed to upheaval as the country has had more than 60 governments since the second world war. But, the latest bout of turbulence comes at a crucial juncture, just when bankers to MPS was trying to convince major investors to stump up billions of euros. What are the consequences for MPS if it fails? Once again, the clock is ticking towards the year-end deadline imposed by the ECB. Time is short if private investors - notably Qatar\u2019s sovereign wealth fund - are to be convinced to buy shares in the Italian bank. If the private sector solution fails, the expectation is that the Italian government will orchestrate a \u201cprecautionary recapitalisation\u201d \u2013 a state-supported cash injection for the bank. What would the Italian government\u2019s involvement entail? Under new EU rules, government funds cannot inject money into banks if bond holders have not taken losses first. The move is intended to avoid a re-run of the tax payer bailouts of 2008 but was targeted at major City investors. In Italy, though, small investors could get hit. Some \u20ac2.1bn of MPS bonds are owned by retail investors \u2013 people, rather than financial institutions \u2013 who face taking losses. Depending on how the recapitalisation is structured, bond holders might be able to avoid these losses. What are the repercussions? It is the first major test of the EU\u2019s new rules for bank rescues. If Italy is allowed to deviate from them, it could undermine the whole system. But failing to find a solution to MPS could further destabilise the Italian banking system, especially at a time when rival Unicredit is thought to be preparing to raise \u20ac12bn.",

The deal brings together the two largest banana distributors in Asia and Europe. The McCann family, whose links with Dublin-based Fyffes date back to 1902, has agreed to sell its 11.79% stake in the Irish fruit supplier, worth nearly \u20ac87.5m. The South-Carolina based Zucker family is in line for a similar payout for its 11.83% stake. The two families and other shareholders will receive \u20ac2.23 per share in cash as well as a final dividend of two cents a share. The Irish company has recommended the deal to investors and 27% have already backed it. David McCann, executive chairman of Fyffes, said the offer was compelling. \u201cOur employees, customers, suppliers and joint venture partners will benefit from Fyffes being part of an enlarged group with greater scale, reach and resources to broaden and accelerate delivery of Fyffes\u2019 strategic objectives.\u201d The takeover comes two years after Fyffes and US rival Chiquita abandoned plans for a merger that would have created the world\u2019s largest banana company. Since then, Fyffes has been on an acquisition trail and recently added mushroom businesses to its portfolio of bananas, melons and pineapples. McCann told the Irish Times that the deal was discussed at a dinner with Sumitomo executives at the Merrion hotel in Dublin two months ago. \u201cWhen discussions like this begin, you can never predict how they\u2019re going to finish,\u201d he said, \u201cbut this is a good transaction for our shareholders and for our people, as we expect the business as a whole to remain intact.\u201d He said he would \u201cstay for a period\u201d. The business has come a long way since 1902 when McCann\u2019s grandfather Charles set up a fruit and veg shop in Dundalk and became the first agent in Ireland for Fyffes, a then-London-based banana importer. Fyffes began in 1888 when Edward Fyffe, a tea importer, went into partnership with a fruit distributor, James Hudson, and started shipping bananas from the Canary Islands to London. The McCanns built up their business and it became known as Fruit Importers of Ireland, which floated on the Irish stock exchange in 1981 and bought Fyffes five years later. Hirohiko Imura, managing executive officer of Sumitomo, said: \u201cWe are grateful that the McCann family has provided an irrevocable commitment of support and is entrusting us to continue with them the rich Fyffes heritage. Sumitomo will provide Fyffes with experience, support and investment to continue to build on the tremendous Fyffes skills and experience and reach greater potential.\u201d",

The South-Carolina based Zucker family is in line for a similar payout for its 11.83% stake. <br></p> <p>The two families and other shareholders <a href=\"http://otp.investis.com/clients/uk/fyffes_plc/rns/regulatory-story.aspx?cid=1767&amp;newsid=826957\">will receive \u20ac2.23 per share in cash</a> as well as a final dividend of two cents a share. The Irish company has recommended the deal to investors and 27% have already backed it.</p> <p>David McCann, executive chairman of Fyffes, said the offer was compelling. \u201cOur employees, customers, suppliers and joint venture partners will benefit from Fyffes being part of an enlarged group with greater scale, reach and resources to broaden and accelerate delivery of Fyffes\u2019 strategic objectives.\u201d</p> <p>The takeover comes two years after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/mar/10/fyffes-merge-chiquita-banana-co-chiquitafyffes\">Fyffes and US rival Chiquita abandoned plans for a merger</a> that would have created the world\u2019s largest banana company. Since then, Fyffes has been on an acquisition trail and recently added mushroom businesses to its portfolio of bananas, melons and pineapples.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.irishtimes.com/business/agribusiness-and-food/how-very-enjoyable-meal-in-dublin-led-to-751m-deal-for-fyffes-1.2899391\">McCann told the Irish Times</a> that the deal was discussed at a dinner with Sumitomo executives at the Merrion hotel in Dublin two months ago.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cWhen discussions like this begin, you can never predict how they\u2019re going to finish,\u201d he said, \u201cbut this is a good transaction for our shareholders and for our people, as we expect the business as a whole to remain intact.\u201d He said he would \u201cstay for a period\u201d.<br></p> <p>The business has come a long way since 1902 when McCann\u2019s grandfather Charles set up a fruit and veg shop in Dundalk and became the first agent in Ireland for Fyffes, a then-London-based banana importer. Fyffes began in 1888 when Edward Fyffe, a tea importer, went into partnership with a fruit distributor, James Hudson, and started shipping bananas from the Canary Islands to London.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/nov/29/fyffes-melons-labour-abuse-claims-honduras-workers\">Fyffes melons at centre of labour abuse claims from Honduran workers</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The McCanns built up their business and it became known as Fruit Importers of Ireland, which floated on the Irish stock exchange in 1981 and bought Fyffes five years later.</p> <p>Hirohiko Imura, managing executive officer of Sumitomo, said: \u201cWe are grateful that the McCann family has provided an irrevocable commitment of support and is entrusting us to continue with them the rich Fyffes heritage. Sumitomo will provide Fyffes with experience, support and investment to continue to build on the tremendous Fyffes skills and experience and reach greater potential.\u201d </p>",

      "bodyText": "Amazon appears to be preparing to open checkout-free grocery stores in Britain after registering a UK trademark for its Amazon Go format. The online retailer opened its first bricks and mortar foodstore on 5 December near its headquarters in Seattle. Amazon employees can shop there and it will open to the public early next year. Customers can walk out without queuing or paying at a checkout. Instead, sensors record the items they pick up and charge them to an Amazon Prime account. Amazon has remained quiet about whether it plans to launch Amazon Go outside the US. It registered a UK trademark on 5 December, indicating it intends to bring the format to Britain. Neil Campling, an analyst at Northern Trust Capital Markets, said: \u201cAmazon want to disrupt and take out inefficiencies from retail whatever the format. We\u2019ve seen Amazon try out pretty much every one of its ideas from the US in the UK and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if next year we see the launch of a very similar service.\u201d Campling said Amazon used the UK as its first non-US market for new formats because UK consumers have proved themselves open to new ideas such as online shopping and Britain has few trading restrictions to stop Amazon shaking up the market. What is convenient for shoppers could be bad news for retail employees. The New York Post said Amazon Go would \u201cautomate American workers out of existence\u201d. A US analyst estimated Amazon\u2019s technology might eventually wipe out three quarters of US grocery store jobs. Before the launch of Amazon Go, the British Retail Consortium predicted almost a third of the UK\u2019s 3m shop jobs would disappear by 2025 as companies use technology instead of people. If Amazon Go catches on in the UK, established retailers would probably be forced to match its convenience to keep their customers. The prospect of rapid automation of the retail industry has added to unease about the use of technology to replace human workers. Capita, the outsourcing company that collects the BBC licence fee, said this week it would cut 2,000 jobs and plough the cost savings into developing robots. The Bank of England\u2019s chief economist Andy Haldane warned earlier this year that 15m UK jobs could eventually be lost to robots. Amazon has rejected reports that it intends to open more than 2,000 physical grocery stores in the US, including shops as big as 40,000 sq ft \u2013 about the same size as an Asda store. Jeff Bezos, its chief executive, said in May more stores were on the way but the company said this week it had no grand plan and was still testing the market. Amazon has made it clear that it is targeting the UK retail market. In February, it announced it would sell fresh and frozen food to UK consumers in a deal with Morrisons and in July it launched Amazon Fresh to sell fresh food to selected postcodes. It is also developing a clothes range, after helping revolutionise the books, music, home entertainment and consumer electronics sectors over the past decade. The Seattle Amazon Go store is 1,800 sq ft and sells food staples such as milk, bread and chocolate as well as ready meals. Its opening follows the launch of a physical bookshop in its home town in November 2015. Amazon Books at University Village in Seattle stocks 6,000 titles, with the selection based on reviews and sales data from Amazon.com. The price of books in the store is the same as on the website. Further bookshops are now also planned for San Diego, New York, Portland and Chicago. Amazon did not respond to a request for comment about registration of the UK trademark.",

      "bodyText": "Sports Direct has confirmed that the future of its chairman, Keith Hellawell, will be voted on for the second time in four months in January. The special meeting has been called by the struggling retailer after 57% of independent shareholders failed to support Hellawell at the annual shareholder meeting in September. Under new financial regulatory rules which give independent shareholders more of a voice on the appointment of non-executive directors, the company has to hold a second vote 90 to 120 days after the first meeting if it wants to hold on to Hellawell. At the second meeting, which will be held at Sports Direct\u2019s headquarters in Shirebrook, Derbyshire, Hellawell\u2019s reappointment can be pushed through with the backing of new CEO Mike Ashley\u2019s 55% majority stake. In September, Ashley insisted his chairman was staying put for at least another year, and they would work together to improve the way the sports chain is managed. In a notice to shareholders announcing the meeting, Sports Direct said it had been disappointed that a majority of independent shareholders had not backed the re-election of Hellawell as required under listing rules. Earlier this week Hellawell criticised MPs, trades unions and the media for waging a campaign against the business. The company did promise to improve its treatment of workers and corporate governance in September. This week it announced the appointment of a new non-executive director, investment banker David Brayshaw. But it also revealed a deal with a cosmetics company linked to Ashley\u2019s daughter and the purchase of a new jet despite a 57% dive in pretax profit to \u00a371.6m. The board said they recommended that shareholders back Hellawell: \u201cThe board believes that the re-election of Dr Hellawell, when combined with the appointment of David Brayshaw, will provide a balance of continuity and fresh, independent insight. The board is also mindful of the importance of maintaining the stability of the leadership of the company as it seeks to implement certain improvements in working practices.\u201d A notice to shareholders published late on Friday made clear that if Hellawell is re-elected in January, but subsequently does not receive the support of a majority of independent shareholders at the next annual general meeting in September 2017, he will \u201cstep down at that time with immediate effect.\u201d Hellawell, a former police chief who has been widely criticised by shareholders, said an \u201cextreme political, union and media campaign waged against this company\u201d had damaged its reputation, influenced customers and had a negative impact on the morale of Sports Direct\u2019s staff.",

Every year thousands of UK passengers file legal claims against airlines in the UK courts, seeking compensation they believe they are owed under the EU delay rules. Lawyers acting for a woman known only as Ms Menditta, who claimed against the Dublin-based Ryanair after a delay in 2015, have been told by the airline that a clause in the airline\u2019s terms and conditions requires disputes to be decided by the Irish courts. In April, Liverpool county court will hear Menditta\u2019s case against Ryanair, but the airline will argue the claim must be brought in Ireland. If the court agrees, all Ryanair passengers could be forced to go through the Irish courts to chase denied compensation. Nicholas Parkinson, a panel solicitor for the flight compensation firmFlightDelays.co.uk, who brought the claim on the passenger\u2019s behalf, said the case could have huge ramifications for all air passengers if Ryanair is successful. \u201cIf passengers were only able to bring a claim using Irish solicitors in the Irish courts, the vast majority of passengers living outside the Republic of Ireland will probably not bother to bring a claim at all \u2013 especially bearing in mind that most claims against Ryanair are only worth between \u00a3210 and \u00a3350. To our knowledge no other reputable airlines have a similar clause in their terms and conditions or, if there are, they do not attempt to rely on this clause.\u201d It is the latest in a series of legal challenges airlines have mounted against the EU rules that require them to compensate passengers for significant delays or cancellations, and overbooking. Passengers can claim \u20ac125-\u20ac600 (\u00a3105-\u00a3500), depending on the event and length of the flight, in their country of origin. The airlines are exempt from having to pay out in certain circumstances \u2013 such as strikes and bad weather \u2013 but have fought a number of failed test cases to avoid other circumstances, particularly technical problems. Kevin Clarke, a flight delay lawyer at Bott &amp; Co solicitors, said this case could represent the biggest threat so far to the rights of passengers under regulation EC 261/2004. \u201cIf Ryanair were to win, this could allow all airlines to select any country within which passengers must bring their claim. There would be nothing stopping UK airlines from stipulating the country in which court proceedings must be commenced in their terms and conditions \u2013 meaning UK passengers would need to find a solicitor in Lithuania or Lebanon, or wherever else the airline chooses.\u201d Ryanair, which flew 117 million passengers last year, said it requires customers to submit flight disruption claims directly to it before engaging third party \u201cclaims chasers\u201d. \u201cClaims chasers don\u2019t like our terms and conditions, because they are designed solely to protect our customers, and ensure they receive 100% of the compensation they are due.\u201d Last year the Civil Aviation Authority began enforcement action against Ryanair to make it pay compensation to thousands of delayed passengers after a European court of justice judgment. At the time the CAA said it was not satisfied with the way the airline was handling compensation claims for disruption caused by routine technical faults.",

      "bodyText": "A series of new battery power-storage plants and two small new gas power stations will be built in the UK following the award of subsidies designed to bolster energy supply and head off the threat of shortages. But government hopes of an ambitious \u201cdash for gas\u201d were dealt another blow after this week\u2019s auction of subsidies to build backup capacity for Britain\u2019s energy network. No new gas power station of a significant scale won a subsidy contract in the bidding process, where companies and technologies competed to provide backup power for the lowest price during the winter of 2020-21. However, the British Gas owner, Centrica, won support for a small-scale gas power plant to be built by 2019 at King\u2019s Lynn in Norfolk. An extension will also be added to US company InterGen\u2019s gas plant in Spalding, Lincolnshire. Analysts at Barclays banking group said: \u201cOverall we believe the auction will largely be viewed as a disappointment by the UK government in terms of securing the significant levels of new gas generation capacity they hoped for in order to ensure security of supply.\u201d The bank said that to encourage big new gas plants, capacity in the auction needed to be sold at \u00a335-\u00a345 per kilowatt, rather than the \u00a322.50 reached. The auction saw 52GW of capacity purchased through government subsidies in a process overseen by National Grid, the UK power system operator. Flexitricity, a business that works with companies which commit to cutting power demand when supply is tight, said the auction results showed the government needed to rethink its push for new gas. \u201cAfter three years, the capacity market has still failed to deliver a single new-build CCGT [gas plant],\u201d said the company\u2019s founder, Dr Alastair Martin. Jonathan Marshall, an analyst at the ECIU thinktank, said: \u201cIf ministers really want to incentivise new gas build, they may need something different from the capacity market in its current form.\u201d Batteries took a much larger share than in previous years, with about 500MW awarded to new storage plants being built by EDF, Centrica and smaller companies. Such facilities can provide electricity in seconds to keep the lights from going out, compared with gas plants such as the new one at King\u2019s Lynn, which would take more than 40 minutes to supply electricity when called upon if, for instance, it is not windy enough to power windfarms. \u201cSmaller embedded generators, including batteries, were the big winners in this auction,\u201d said Tom Edwards, an analyst at Cornwall Energy. Green groups welcomed the news that government auction had led to diesel generators, which have been accused of causing noise and air pollution, winning a smaller share than in previous years. But they were disappointed that coal still fared well \u2013 winning a tenth of backup capacity \u2013 despite the government\u2019s promises to phase out the polluting fuel by 2025. Existing large coal, gas and nuclear power stations will provide 85% of backup power in 2020-21. Rebecca Williams, an energy expert at conservation campaign group WWF, said: \u201cI do think there is a real danger of coal continuing to linger round on the system, crowding out investment in the more flexible generation our system needs.\u201d She urged the government to restrict coal\u2019s access to the capacity market in future, to avoid undercutting investment in other \u201cmore attractive\u201d forms of flexible capacity. ScottishPower, which had hoped to win contracts for new large gas power stations, said it was disappointed that coal had won so much capacity. \u201cDiesel was the winner last year, and coal is the winner this year. Clearing 20 times more old coal than new gas signals a willingness to sweat these assets until the bitter end,\u201d said Neil Clitheroe, the company\u2019s global retail director. This week\u2019s auction, the third so far under the capacity market, will cost consumers \u00a315 a household in 2020-21 as energy users shoulder the cost of the subsidies. The government said energy supply was being secured at a \u201clow cost\u201d to bill-payers. Greg Clark, the business and energy secretary, said: \u201cThis is about more than just keeping the lights on. A modern, reliable and flexible electricity system powers the economy and Britain\u2019s future success.\u201d",

Such facilities can provide electricity in seconds to keep the lights from going out, compared with gas plants such as the new one at King\u2019s Lynn, which would take more than 40 minutes to supply electricity when called upon if, for instance, it is not windy enough to power windfarms.</p> <p>\u201cSmaller embedded generators, including batteries, were the big winners in this auction,\u201d said Tom Edwards, an analyst at Cornwall Energy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/dec/2016-12-09T23:09:09/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Capacity market technology\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/dec/2016-12-09T23:09:09/embed.html\">Capacity market technology</a> </figure>  <p>Green groups welcomed the news that government auction had led to diesel generators, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/06/diesel-farms-national-grid-tax-breaks\">which have been accused of causing noise and air pollution</a>, winning a smaller share than in previous years. </p> <p>But they were disappointed that coal still fared well \u2013 winning a tenth of backup capacity \u2013 despite the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/nov/09/britains-last-coal-power-plants-to-close-by-2025\">government\u2019s promises to phase out the polluting fuel by 2025</a>.

      "bodyText": "Elsewhere crude prices have come off their best levels after US drillers added more oil rigs for the sixth week in a row: On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back on Monday. Italy\u2019s cabinet has no plans to meet on Saturday to discuss the current banking situation, Reuters is reporting, quoting government sources. But it stands ready to implement an emergency decree on banks if necessary, Reuters adds. Even though Italy\u2019s Monte dei Paschi fell more than 10% on concerns about its refinancing, investors elsewhere remained fairly calm. Ahead of the next big economic event - the Federal Reserve\u2019s expected increase in US interest rates next week - markets were supported by the European Central Bank\u2019s suggestion it would continue acting to help the eurozone economy. Meanwhile the proposed offer by 21st Century Fox for satellite broadcaster Sky helped lift shares in London. Italy unsurprisingly missed out on the gains, given the fall in Monet dei Paschi. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 22.66 points or 0.33% at 6954.21 Germany\u2019s Dax edged up 0.22% to 11,203.63 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.6% higher at 4764.07 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 0.73% to 18,292.65 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 0.26% at 9169.6 In Greece, the Athens market dipped 1.26% to 640.09 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 75 points or 0.38%, heading for a new closing high. Ratings agency Moody\u2019s has just downgraded the outlook for seven Italian banks to negative: Moody\u2019s Investors Service has today changed the outlook to negative from stable and affirmed the ratings of seven financial institutions, prompted by the outlook change to negative from stable on the Italian government\u2019s Baa2 debt rating... The following banks are affected by today\u2019s rating actions: Intesa Sanpaolo Spa, Banca IMI Spa, FCA Bank S.p.A., Banca Nazionale Del Lavoro S.P.A., Credito Emiliano SpA, Credit Agricole Cariparma S.p.A., and Cassa Depositi e Prestiti S.p.A. Back to Italy, and Monte dei Paschi has closed down more than 10% after the European Central Bank reportedly refused an extension for a potential private sector fundraising. But other Italian bank shares were not hit as badly: Here\u2019s our story on the Sky bid: Some breaking news: satellite broadcaster Sky has agreed to be taken over by Rupert Murdoch\u2019s 21st Century Fox for \u00a310.75 a share or more than \u00a318bn. But Sky said the two sides were still in discussions about \u201ccertain material offer terms\u201d and there was no guarantee an offer would be made. Sky shares have jumped 31% to \u00a310.42. Over in Greece prime minister Alexis Tsipras has taken creditors aback by announcing a Christmas bonus for pensioners surviving on \u20ac800 or less. Helena Smith reports from Athens: It was meant to be a goodwill gesture, announced in the wake of anti-austerity protests at the end of a crippling 24-hour nationwide strike. Instead, prime minister Alexis Tsipras\u2019 declaration of a one off bonus payment to supplement the pensions of some 1.6 million low-income retirees has triggered renewed tensions with the country\u2019s creditors. Under scheme \u2013 unveiled in a televised address to the nation late on Thursday \u2013 around \u20ac600m will be handed to pensioners living on living on \u20ac800 or less a month. Greece is under tight stewardship by lenders keeping it afloat. The prospect of another round of pension and wage cuts set as the price of emergency bailout funding has seen Tsipras\u2019 own popularity and that of his leftist-led coalition tumble. Responding to the news a commission spokeswoman said Brussels had not been informed of Tsipras\u2019 surprise spending spree, the details of which it would have to study. \u201cThe program includes clear commitments to discuss all measures related to program objectives with the institutions in advance,\u201d she told reporters this afternoon. \u201cThe Commission was not made aware of all the details of the announcements before they were made.\u201d Donald Trump\u2019s surprise election victory has not only boosted the stock market, it has also given US consumers more confidence. The initial reading of December\u2019s University of Michigan\u2019s consumer sentiment survey came in at 98, up from a revised 93.8 in November and well above expectations of a figure of 94.5. And it was mainly down to Trump. The survey\u2019s chief economist Richard Curtin said: Consumer confidence surged in early December to just one-tenth of an Index point below the 2015 peak\u2014which was the highest level since the start of 2004. The surge was largely due to consumers\u2019 initial reactions to Trump\u2019s surprise victory. When asked what news they had heard of recent economic developments, more consumers spontaneously mentioned the expected positive impact of new economic policies than ever before recorded in the long history of the surveys. To be sure, an equal number volunteered negative judgments about prospective economic policies, but the frequency of those negative references was less than half its prior peak levels whereas positive references were about twice its prior peak. There were a few exceptions to the early December surge in optimism, mainly among those with a college degree and among residents of the Northeast [our bold italics], although no group has adopted a pessimistic outlook for the economy. The most important implication of the increase in optimism is that it has raised expectations for the performance of the economy. President-elect Trump must provide early evidence of positive economic growth as well as act to keep positive consumer expectations aligned with performance. Either too slow growth or too high expectations represent barriers to maintaining high levels of consumer confidence. Until specific policies are proposed, there is no reason to alter the 2017 forecast of 2.5% for real consumption. The worries about Monte dei Paschi may be sending the Italian stock market lower - the FTSE MIB is currently down 1.1% - but elsewhere the mood is brighter. On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 30 points at 19,644, while Nasdaq composite is up 0.34% to a new peak of 5435. In Europe, the FTSE 100 is up 0.2% while Germany\u2019s Dax has added 0.18% and France\u2019s Cac has climbed 0.57%. Commenting on International Personal Finance, Numis analysts said: The [Polish] Ministry of Justice, as opposed to the ministry of finance has, as part of a criminal law change and anti-usury measures, suggested that the interest rate cap in Poland is reduced. There is a 14 day consultation period and the ministry of finance may intervene. Assuming the cap is enacted as proposed it would materially reduce the revenue profile of the Polish business, calling into question the viability of the home credit model. Where under the existing cap IPF would collect \u00a3168 from a \u00a3100 loan, under the new proposal it would only be able to collect \u00a3126. We now value IPF assuming that there is no value in Poland and that includes the capital that is allocated to this division. Elsewhere International Personal Finance, the emerging markets lender, has slumped 30% after it said Polish authorities had published a draft bill cutting the costs lenders can charge on consumer loan agreements. It said was \u201creviewing the proposal to assess the extent to which the profitability of its Polish business would be affected by the proposed changes.\u201d The proposal reduces the flat level cap of 25% of loan value to 10% and an annual cap from 30% to 10% per annum. This is not the first time the company has been hit by changes in regulation. The debt to equity swap was predicated on a cash call going ahead, and that now looks in doubt, hence the fall in the bonds which were included in the swap. As part of its latest story on Monte dei Paschi, Italy\u2019s Repubblica is suggesting the country may pass a decree this weekend allowing state aid. The story (in Italian) is here. Shares in Monte dei Paschi have restarted but fallen to 11.4%, so suspended again. And back to Italy: trading in Monte dei Paschi\u2019s shares has been halted after they fell 7.3%. Away from Italy\u2019s banking problems, and the UK\u2019s Office for National Statistics has released details of the gender pay gap in various professions. Its interactive tool to see the gap in your job sector is here. And my colleague Katie Allen has written an analysis: If you are a female traffic warden or probation officer read on for good news. If you are a female chief executive you may want to look away now. The UK\u2019s stubbornly wide gender pay gap is well-known. Almost half a century on from the gender pay act, there is still an 18.1% difference in average pay between men and women. Of course, such average figures for all employees tell a narrow story. They don\u2019t, for example, account for the fact more women work in lower paid jobs or sectors. But now people can quickly look up how things stand between the sexes in their particular job with a new interactive tool from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). It also shows how many women and men work in each role. For example, women classed as \u201cchief executives and senior officials\u201d are paid 28.7% less than men in that group, at \u00a334.91 per hour versus \u00a348.94 per hour for men. Women hold 30% of those jobs. Her full piece is here: News of the ECB\u2019s rejection of an extension for the Monte dei Paschi fundraising has seen the bank\u2019s shares drop 6.6%. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: The decision by the European Central Bank to reject Italy\u2019s demand for more time to secure private funding for a bailout of Monte dei Paschi is likely to keep markets apprehensive at the prospect of how any new Italian government might look in the context of dealing with the country\u2019s banking sector, bringing closer the prospect of a possible politically toxic bail-in of retail bondholders. Here\u2019s the full Reuters report on Monte dei Paschi: The European Central Bank has rejected a request by ailing Italian lender Monte dei Paschi di Siena for more time to raise capital, a source said on Friday, in a move that piles pressure on the Italian government to bail out the bank. The country\u2019s third-largest lender, and the world\u2019s oldest, had asked for a three-week extension until January 20 to try to wrap up a privately funded, 5 billion euros ($5.3 billion) rescue plan in the face of fresh political uncertainty. The ECB\u2019s supervisory board turned down the request at a meeting on Friday on the grounds that a delay would be of little use and that it was time for Rome to step in, the source said. The Italian government is expected to intervene to recapitalise the bank to avert the risk of it being wound down. The failure of Monte dei Paschi could threaten the savings of thousands of retail investors, ripple across the wider banking sector and provoke a financial crisis in the euro zone\u2019s third-biggest economy. Italy faces the risk of early elections, and the prospect of an anti-euro party coming to power, after Prime Minister Matteo Renzi quit this week following the heavy defeat of his plan to reform the constitution in a weekend referendum. Breaking: Shares in Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena (MPS), are down 2% on reports that the ECB will reject the Italian bank\u2019s request for more time to raise capital. The clock is now ticking on the world\u2019s oldest bank and it throws open the possibility that the Italian government will to step in to help it find the billions of euros it needs to bolster its capital. Meanwhile more on Britain\u2019s productivity puzzle: Sticking with Ireland, GDP increased by 4% in the third quarter, driven higher by consumer spending and exports. It put the annual growth rate at 6.9%, and left the Irish economy on track to be the fastest growing among its European peers for a third successive year in 2016. Alan McQuaid, chief economist at Merrion Stockbrokers: The government looks on target for its forecasts, the figures are stronger than expected. Consumer spending is holding up well, at this stage there is no sign of a major Brexit hit. Fyffes, the Dublin based grower and distributor of fruit, has agreed to a \u20ac751m (\u00a3631m) bid from Sumitomo, which supplies about one in three bananas sold in Japan. Fyffes employs more than 6,000 people and is focused mainly on bananas, pineapples and melons. It has an annual turnover of more than \u20ac1.2bn. Fyffes shareholders will receive \u20ac2.23 a share, representing a 49% premium on the company\u2019s closing price on Thursday. The McCann family have run the company for many years, and hold a stake of over 12% according to the Irish Times. Commenting on the deal, chairman David McCann, said the deal would help Fyffes to grow: Our employees, customers, suppliers and joint venture partners will benefit from Fyffes being part of an enlarged group with greater scale, reach and resources to broaden and accelerate delivery of Fyffes\u2019 strategic objectives. Gold is on course for its fifth weekly drop as investors price in a Federal Reserve rate hike next week. Spot gold fell 0.1% to $1,170.06 an ounce, leaving it down 0.6% over the week. The precious metal fell more than 8% in November, and hit a 10-month low on Monday. US Treasury yields have risen since Donald Trump won the US presidential election, which is a negative for gold because it pays no interest. The Bank of England has published its latest quarterly inflation expectation survey. It gives an indication of what the public thinks is happening to prices. When asked what the current rate of inflation is, the median answer given was 2.3%, up from 1.8% in the August survey. (At the last count the official rate of inflation was actually 0.9%.) More than 2,000 people aged 16 and over were surveyed. October\u2019s trade data was partly flattered by a particular poor performance in September. The ONS admitted on Tuesday an error in trade figures going back to 2015. It meant the trade performance was healthier than previously estimated before the referendum, but worse than previously estimated after the Brexit vote. Full story here: City economists say the stronger-than-expected export performance suggests trade could make a decent contribution to GDP in the fourth quarter: Howard Archer at IHS Markit: Very much on the positive side, the trade performance improved substantially in October as exports jumped 4.6% month-on-month and imports fell 3.6% . This suggests that net trade can make a decent positive contribution to GDP growth \u2013 although it needs to be remembered that the data can be highly volatile and subject to significant revisions The hope for the UK economy going forward is that the substantial overall weakening of the pound since the UK voted to leave the European Union in June\u2019s referendum will increasingly feed through to boost foreign demand for UK goods and services. (Archer believes the economy will grow by 0.4% in the fourth quarter, following 0.5% growth in the third quarter.) Scott Bowman at Capital Economics: While the monthly data are extremely volatile, the narrowing in the trade deficit in October sets a solid base for trade in Q4. What\u2019s more, trade should be further supported in the coming months by the fall in sterling seen since the EU referendum, which should improve exporters\u2019 competitiveness and encourage domestic production at the expense of imports. Britain\u2019s trade in goods deficit narrowed more than expected in October, to \u00a39.7bn from \u00a313.8bn in September, as exports rose but imports fell. Exports rose by \u00a32.1bn to \u00a326.8bn, while imports fell by \u00a32bn to \u00a336.5bn. Policymakers are hopeful that the sharp value in the fall of the pound since the June Brexit vote will boost exports, because it makes British goods cheaper abroad, but the ONS isn\u2019t convinced this is what happened in October. Hannah Finselbach, ONS statistician, says: Following the EU referendum the UK trade deficit widened in the third quarter of 2016 and then in October it narrowed again. There remains only limited evidence so far that the depreciation of sterling has led to a marked increase in UK exports. UK construction fell 0.6% in October, disappointing expectations of a 0.2% rise. It wasn\u2019t all bad news however, as September\u2019s growth figure was revised higher to 0.9% from 0.3%. It means construction output was 0.7% higher over the year, according to the Office for National Statistics figures. The City regulator is turning its attention to crowdfunding, a rapidly growing sector that lets businesses and individuals raise money from online investors. The Financial Conduct Authority cites several concerns, among them the difficulty for investors to assess the risks and returns of such an investment. Crowdfunding is a massive growth sector, rising from \u00a31.7bn of loans, investments and donations in 2014 to \u00a33.4bn last year. BrewDog, the self-styled punk brewer, has raised \u00a326m from UK beer drinkers using crowdfunding. Read our full story here: Also coming up today are UK trade data and construction output for October. Both will give further clues about how the economy is performing in the final quarter of 2016. Economists are predicting the trade in goods deficit will narrow to \u00a311.8bn, while construction output is expected to rise by 0.2% over the month. German exports were weaker than expected in October, rising by 0.5% and not 1% as forecast by economists. It was better than September, when exports fell 1%, but dampened hopes that trade will significantly boost growth in Europe\u2019s largest economy in the fourth quarter. Imports rose 1.3% in October according to the Federal Statistics Office, more than the 0.9% predicted by economists. The jump in imports narrowed Germany\u2019s trade surplus to \u20ac20.5bn from \u20ac21.5bn in September The FTSE 100 is slightly higher this morning, up 0.1% or five points at 6,397. Elsewhere in Europe, markets are mixed: Germany\u2019s DAX: flat at 11,184 France\u2019s CAC: +0.3% at 4,751 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: -0.7% at 18,306 Spain\u2019s IBEX: -0.2% at 9,130 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: +0.2% at 353 Benoit Coeure, executive board member at the ECB, has been speaking to French radio this morning. He says the central bank\u2019s surprise decision to prolong the programme to next December or beyond, but scale back the pace of purchases, was a vote of \u201cconfidence\u201d in the eurozone economy. But he made it clear the bank would do more if necessary, as the eurozone faces a 2017 littered with challenges: There are political risks everywhere, inside and outside of the euro zone. It\u2019s not up to the ECB to manage political risks, that\u2019s for the politicians to do. But it\u2019s up to us to draw the economic consequences and the eurozone will still need financial protection to get through 2017, which will be very risky. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Japan\u2019s Nikkei has closed up 1.2% following gains in the US. In Europe markets are on track to make weekly gains following the European Central Bank\u2019s decision on Thursday to prolong its quantitative easing programme. Investors left scratching their heads as the ECB prolonged the programme but scaled back the pace of monthly purchases to \u20ac60bn from \u20ac80bn might be boosted this morning by EBC official Benoit Coeure, who told French radio this morning policymakers are ready to do more if necessary. In Japan, the Nikkei followed US markets higher, up 1.2% at 18,996. Michael Hewson, Chief Market Analyst at CMC Markets UK, gives this take on markets: Just when you think US stocks may have peaked and can\u2019t move any higher they go and register new all-time highs once again, in what is becoming a fairly regular theme, with the Dow, S&amp;P 500 and the Russell 2000 repeating the trick for the second day in a row. With European markets also posting new multi-month highs as well it would appear that the season of good cheer has come upon us early in the lead up to Christmas, and next week\u2019s offerings from the US Federal Reserve. Given the result of the Italian referendum it seems completely counterintuitive to be saying that the DAX and the FTSE Mib are on course to post their biggest weekly gains this year, begging the question as to what would have happened if there had been a yes vote and Renzi had stayed? Sometimes markets don\u2019t make any sense at all!",

It also shows how many women and men work in each role.</p> <p>For example, women classed as \u201cchief executives and senior officials\u201d are paid 28.7% less than men in that group, at \u00a334.91 per hour versus \u00a348.94 per hour for men. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/women\">Women</a> hold 30% of those jobs.</p> </blockquote> <p>Her full piece is here:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/economics-blog/2016/dec/09/gender-pay-gap-tool-reveals-the-good-the-bad-and-the-scandalous\">Gender pay gap tool reveals the good, the bad and the scandalous</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-584ab1e3e4b06a0d55b1932b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-12-09T13:30:50.017Z\">1.30pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>News of the ECB\u2019s rejection of an extension for the Monte dei Paschi fundraising has seen the bank\u2019s shares drop 6.6%.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-584ab18ce4b04a74f2781c69\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-12-09T13:29:37.973Z\">1.29pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The decision by the European Central Bank to reject Italy\u2019s demand for more time to secure private funding for a bailout of Monte dei Paschi is likely to keep markets apprehensive at the prospect of how any new Italian government might look in the context of dealing with the country\u2019s banking sector, bringing closer the prospect of a possible politically toxic bail-in of retail bondholders.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-584aac8be4b04a74f2781c48\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-12-09T13:14:19.433Z\">1.14pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here\u2019s the full Reuters report on Monte dei Paschi:</p> <blockquote> <p>The European Central Bank has rejected a request by ailing Italian lender Monte dei Paschi di Siena for more time to raise capital, a source said on Friday, in a move that piles pressure on the Italian government to bail out the bank.</p> <p>The country\u2019s third-largest lender, and the world\u2019s oldest, had asked for a three-week extension until January 20 to try to wrap up a privately funded, 5 billion euros ($5.3 billion) rescue plan in the face of fresh political uncertainty.</p> <p>The ECB\u2019s supervisory board turned down the request at a meeting on Friday on the grounds that a delay would be of little use and that it was time for Rome to step in, the source said.</p> <p>The Italian government is expected to intervene to recapitalise the bank to avert the risk of it being wound down.

      "bodyText": "Why has Pfizer been fined the colossal sum of \u00a384.2m over a drug it makes to control epilepsy seizures? The Competition and Markets Authority says Pfizer and a small company called Flynn Pharma both charged \u201cexcessive and unfair prices\u201d for the supply of an anti-epilepsy drug in the UK. It\u2019s a huge fine \u2013 in fact, it\u2019s a record. The CMA has hit Pfizer as hard as it is able, partly because the huge American pharmaceutical company has such large coffers that anything less will not make much of a dent, and partly to send a message to other drug companies that they should not even think about trying the same thing. It has also fined Flynn Pharma \u00a35.2m, which is 10% of its worldwide turnover \u2013 the maximum possible fine. So what have they done that is so heinous? Pfizer has been making phenytoin sodium capsules for so many years \u2013 nobody is quite sure how long \u2013 that the price originally agreed with the NHS now looks very low, at \u00a32.83 for a 100mg pack. Pfizer claims it was losing money on it. In September 2012, the company sold the distribution rights to Flynn Pharma, which debranded the drug. That meant that the drug, called Epanutin, was no longer sold as a Pfizer drug, and any profits from sales would no longer count towards the total amount Pfizer is allowed to earn in a year from the NHS, which is capped under the complicated arrangements of the pharmaceutical price regulation scheme (PPRS). Did Flynn Pharma take over the manufacture and sales? No. Pfizer continued to make the drug, just as before, but sold it to Flynn Pharma, which sold it on to the NHS \u2013 at \u00a367.50 per pack. That\u2019s an increase of 2,600%. Later it dropped the price a tad, to \u00a354. But it was still far more expensive than anywhere else that Pfizer sells the drug in Europe. That must have cost the NHS a pretty penny. Yep. The NHS bill for Epanutin shot up from \u00a32m in 2012 to \u00a350m in 2013. The NHS has been paying this hugely increased price for four years now. Why didn\u2019t the NHS stop buying it then? This drug was old and out of patent. Weren\u2019t there cheaper generic alternatives? Normally they would, yes \u2013 generics are cheaper because anybody can make copies of drugs that are out of patent, so there is competition, which drives prices right down. But in this case, Pfizer and Flynn had the NHS over a barrel. Because this drug prevents people having epileptic fits, doctors are advised not to switch patients even to a generic version of the same thing, for fear that their epilepsy might slip out of control. So yes, there are generic versions of phenytoin sodium, but some are liquids, some are in different doses, and none of them is exactly the same as Epanutin. So the 48,000 patients on Epanutin had to stay on Epanutin. Does Pfizer accept the CMA\u2019s findings? Absolutely not. Pfizer rebuts any allegation of wrongdoing and says it acted entirely within the rules. It says it was making a loss and \u201cthe Flynn transaction\u201d was a chance to secure the supply of an important medicine. It also said it pitched the price to the NHS at 25% to 40% less than that of an equivalent version of the drug that the NHS had been buying for a long time. In a very robust statement, Pfizer said it would appeal every aspect of the decision. So what happens next? The government has realised that it does not have quite the kind of control that it thought it had over drug prices. There is new legislation under way to ensure that the department of health can get tough with companies hiking their prices, so even if Pfizer wins on appeal, it hopes it will be able to block this particular loophole. In the meantime, there are several other cases being investigated by the CMA. It won\u2019t say which companies or which drugs, but it is thought they may involve similar situations. Are drug companies often found to be up to anti-competitive practices? There is a bit of history. Big Pharma has been caught looking for ways to hang on to profits from blockbuster drugs when they approach the end of their patent life. Earlier this year, GlaxoSmithKline was hammered by the CMA, effectively for paying off generic companies that wanted to make cheap copies of its best-selling antidepressant, paroxetine (Seroxat). In 2001, profits from Seroxat were earning GSK \u00a390m, so lobbing a few million to some generic companies to get them to keep out of the way seemed like good business. But that meant the NHS continued to have to pay a high price for the drug, and the CMA was not impressed, fining GSK a total of \u00a337.6m.",

      "bodyText": "The London mayor has accused the government of \u201cabandoning passengers\u201d on Southern rail, on a morning when hundreds of thousands of commuters suffered fresh chaos as the impact of a train drivers\u2019 overtime ban hit home. Sadiq Khan called on the rail unions to cancel strikes planned for next week but strongly criticised the government for \u201cwashing their hands of the crisis\u201d. He said: \u201cThe ongoing chaos on Southern rail services is a total disgrace that is badly failing commuters who just want to get to work and back. The unions should cancel the strikes and get back around the negotiating table, but the government are washing their hands of this crisis and abandoning commuters in the process.\u201d Despite three days of strikes called by conductors in the RMT union coming to an end on Thursday night, the effect of the Aslef union\u2019s overtime ban brought widespread disruption on Friday. Southern said there were delays and cancellations across all of its routes, including the main Brighton line into Victoria. Gatwick Express services between Brighton and the airport did not run, and many metropolitan trains were cancelled. Some branch lines on the coast have been closed indefinitely. Commuters reported arguments and chaos at major hubs such as East Croydon, where commuters were unable to board some of the remaining Southern services due to overcrowding. Southern\u2019s operating company, Govia Thameslink Railway, on Thursday failed to secure an injunction to stop Aslef\u2019s industrial action going ahead. A high court judge rejected its claims that the action infringed rights enshrined in European law. A full strike by drivers on Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday next week is expected to stop all Southern trains from running, while the knock-on effects of the action will also curtail services on Monday and Thursday. Another full week of strikes looms in January. Khan contrasted the ongoing strikes on Southern \u2013 in its long-running dispute over changes to the roles of conductors and drivers \u2013 with his success in averting two strikes planned on the London Underground this week. But his policy of engaging with the unions has been rejected by the transport secretary, Chris Grayling, who this week overturned plans to allow Transport for London (TfL) to take over the running of commuter trains into the capital. It was later revealed that Grayling had opposed the plans, approved by his Conservative predecessor, Patrick McLoughlin, because he did not want a Labour mayor to be running the parts of the network currently franchised to the likes of Southern. Khan pointed out that the number of days lost to strikes on the TfL underground network had fallen by 92% since his election. He said that situation on Southern showed once again why commuter rail lines, including Southern, Southeastern and South West Trains, should be devolved to TfL. He said: \u201cThe chaos on the government-run Southern services this week is in stark contrast to TfL \u2013 who successfully persuaded the unions to call off their planned strike on the underground through engagement and negotiation. \u201cIt is absolutely clear that commuters would suffer from fewer strikes if TfL controlled these routes, and fares would be more affordable \u2013 with our four-year freeze on all TfL fares.\u201d\u200e Khan has urged London commuters to lobby Grayling to reverse his decision to stop TfL taking over the inner parts of the franchises. A Conservative MP on the Southeastern commuter route, Bob Neill, called for Grayling\u2019s resignation in the wake of the move, saying the transport secretary had \u201cdone a great deal of harm to London commuters who would have benefited significantly\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "News of a pick-up in exports has fanned hopes the UK economy will finish the year on a strong note, confounding earlier fears that the Brexit vote would spark a sharp slowdown. Official figures showed the UK\u2019s trade deficit with the rest of the world narrowed more than expected in October as exports rose and imports fell. But statisticians said there was little evidence that the weak pound \u2013 which makes UK goods cheaper overseas \u2013 was boosting exports. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) also significantly revised earlier figures to show the UK\u2019s trade deficit in the three months following the Brexit vote had ballooned to a near-three-year high rather than narrowed. The revision followed corrections to the way gold trade had been calculated. The deficit on trade in goods was \u00a39.7bn in October, narrowing by \u00a34.1bn from September 2016 and beating economists\u2019 forecasts for \u00a311.8bn in a Reuters poll. That reflected a \u00a32.1bn increase in exports and a \u00a32bn decrease in imports, the ONS said. Economists highlighted a worse picture when using less volatile figures for the three months to October. They showed goods export volumes fell by 2.1%, while imports rose by 4.4%. \u201cGiven the steep fall in sterling, one would have expected this to be the other way round, with exports rising and imports falling,\u201d said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at the consultancy IHS Markit. ONS statistician Hannah Finselbach echoed that: \u201cFollowing the EU referendum the UK trade deficit widened in the third quarter of 2016 and then in October it narrowed again,\u201d she said. \u201cThere remains only limited evidence so far that the depreciation of sterling has led to a marked increase in UK exports.\u201d Taking together goods trade and estimates of the UK\u2019s trade in services such as consultancy and banking, an area where the country runs a surplus, the gap for October was \u00a32bn, a narrowing of \u00a33.8bn from September 2016. The revisions made to the third quarter trade figures showed the trade deficit for goods and services was now estimated at \u00a314.9bn, the biggest since the end 2013 and a widening of \u00a36.7bn from the second quarter. The ONS had previously said the deficit had narrowed by \u00a31.7bn in the third quarter. But statisticians said the changes would not affect its estimate that the overall economy grew 0.5% in the third quarter. Economists said the latest trade data pointed to a similar pace of expansion for the final quarter of the year. \u201cWhile the monthly data are extremely volatile, the narrowing in the trade deficit in October sets a solid base for trade in the fourth quarter,\u201d said Scott Bowman at the consultancy Capital Economics. \u201cWhat\u2019s more, trade should be further supported in the coming months by the fall in sterling seen since the EU referendum, which should improve exporters\u2019 competitiveness and encourage domestic production at the expense of imports.\u201d Separate figures from the ONS showed construction output, which accounts for around 6% of the economy, fell in October, disappointing expectations of a rise. Output was down 0.6% on the month in October but September\u2019s performance was better than previously expected with output growth revised up to 0.9% from 0.3%. That left construction output was 0.7% higher over the year. \u201cOverall the data paint a mixed picture of the sector,\u201d said Kay Daniel Neufeld at the consultancy Centre for Economics and Business Research. \u201cPositive contributions to output growth came from new private house building, while a decrease in infrastructure output exerted a drag on growth. The sector continues to face various challenges ranging from financial constraints to a shortage of skilled labour. \u201cHowever, given the announcements in the latest autumn statement, we can be cautiously optimistic that investments in infrastructure and housebuilding will support the industry throughout 2017.\u201d",

The sector continues to face various challenges ranging from financial constraints to a shortage of skilled labour. </p> <p>\u201cHowever, given the announcements in the latest autumn statement, we can be cautiously optimistic that investments in infrastructure and housebuilding will support the industry throughout 2017.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Banks might have to pay out more in compensation to victims of the \u00a340bn payment protection insurance scandal after the financial regulator delayed a decision on setting a deadline for complaints. The Financial Conduct Authority said in August it was considering a mid-2019 cutoff for PPI claims and would decide before the end of 2016. The proposed deadline was more than a year later than the industry had expected, raising the prospect of more claims being allowed. The FCA said it had received a large volume of responses to its proposal and that it would decide on the deadline in the first three months of next year. The delay means the final deadline for claims is likely to be pushed back by a few months from the mid-2019 date. The regulator said: \u201cThe timetable was \u2026 subject to a number of variables including the extent and nature of the feedback received in response to the consultation. We have received a large amount of feedback and, given the importance of this matter, we are carefully considering the issues raised.\u201d The bill for the PPI scandal topped \u00a340bn in October when Barclays increased its provisions to \u00a38.4bn in response to the FCA\u2019s previous announcement. Lloyds, the biggest seller of PPI, increased its provisions by \u00a31bn to \u00a317bn the same month and said it hoped the charge would cap its costs. Banks may now need to set more money aside to deal with PPI, which is the most expensive scandal to affect the UK financial industry. Barclays shares closed down 2.5% at 233p on Friday, while Lloyds shares were down 1.6% to 61.7p. The FCA delayed its decision as it emerged Santander had failed to provide customers with information about PPI required under rules governing the scandal. The Competition and Markets Authority said Santander failed to send letters to more than 500 customers that set out the cost of PPI and reminded them they were allowed to cancel the product. The CMA said the bank had sent letters in which it apologised to customers and said it would issue refunds if the customers cancel policies within six months of receiving the apology. Banks sold highly profitable PPI alongside mortgages, loans and credit cards from the late 1990s. PPI was meant to repay borrowings if a customer became ill or unemployed but policies were often structured to limit payouts, imposed on customers as a condition of a loan or sold to people who would not qualify for a claim.",

      "bodyText": "European shares have made a mixed start to the day, with the FTSE 100 edging higher but Germany\u2019s Dax dipping slightly. But outsourcing firm Capita has continued its slide after issuing its second profit warning in three months on Thursday. After a 14% decline following the announcement, its shares are down another 6% to 453.9p, the lowest level since July 2006. Shore Capital issued a sell note, with analyst Robin Speakman saying: Following yesterday\u2019s full year trading update (effectively a further profits warning, in our view) ...we cut our 2017 adjusted earnings per share forecast from 63p to 50p, so a 20% downgrade. We focus upon the strategy from the company which we believe prioritises maintaining the dividend - through selling assets to reduce debt and build balance sheet reserves. However, our model suggests that free cash flow available for strategic development and debt reduction post the dividend payment is set to remain under pressure. We retain a negative view on Capita therefore and would use any recovery in the share price to exit the stock. We note that from a technical position, Capita may now be looking at an exit from its FTSE100 status at the current share price. Analysts at Barclays slashed their target price from \u00a311 to 525p, saying: So another outsourcer bites the bullet in order to delever. Is it just unfortunate coincidence that nearly all the big UK outsourcers have suffered the indignity of having their accounting policies scrutinised, a string of contract disputes or issues resulting in multiple profit warnings, or is there a systemic issue across the sector? The latter is a function of contract complexity and risk - both of which have increased over the years, at a time when competitive tension has increased forcing the major players to offer more for less. What is also very clear is that big is not beautiful in this market. Both Capita and Serco increased their scale and scope through aggressive M&amp;A in order to access broader market opportunities in adjacent market areas away from their historical core. That strategy is now in reverse. Sadly for Capita, they are selling the wrong bit, in our view. Post material downgrades, Capita trades on around 9.2 times 2018 (post disposal) PE with an around 8.1% 2017 free cash flow yield. This is the cheapest Capita has ever been in PE terms both relative (now 50% discount to FTSE-Allshare) and absolute. On an enterprise value/ EBITDA basis around 7 times seems low, but the average across the outsourcing peer group is just 7.5 times (on which our revised 525p price target is based). A near term re-rating is unlikely until growth stabilises and the strategic fog clears - but neither is likely for another 6-months in our view. Overall the FTSE 100 is currently up 9.09 points at 6940.64, as investors tried to digest the news from the European Central Bank which extended its bond buying programme until the end of next year but reduced the montly amount it would buy. Analysts are also cautious ahead of next week\u2019s Federal Reserve meeting, which is widely expected to increase US interest rates. David Morrison, senior market strategist at Spread Co, said: European stock indices have had a mixed start this morning. This is despite the US majors posting a clutch of fresh record closes last night. Yesterday the ECB managed to suggest that a tapering in its bond purchase programme was in the offing despite increasing monetary stimulus by slightly more than expected. Mario Draghi also made it clear that further stimulus could be forthcoming if inflation and growth showed signs of faltering in the future. There was a positive market reaction to this (and a sell-off in the euro) as the ECB President also emphasised that risks to Euro zone growth were still tilted to the downside. Meanwhile the post-Trump surge from early November is now turning into a Christmas rally. The major US indices really look overbought at current levels and many analysts are warning that a correction is long-overdue. But there\u2019s no doubt that short-sellers have had a torrid time of late as even the shallowest of sell-offs has been met with a barrage of buying. But what happens to bond yields is key now. A 25 basis point rate hike next week from the Fed is completely priced in. But what is uncertain is the outlook for future monetary tightening. If the FOMC\u2019s \u201cdot plot\u201d is as hawkish as it was this time last year when it indicated four rate hikes in 2016, then we can expect a jump in yields and sharp downward correction in equities. Elsewhere defensive healthcare stocks were in demand, with Mediclinic up 19.5p at 724p, Smith &amp; Nephew 31p better at \u00a311.61 and Hikma 29p higher at \u00a317.30. Paddy Power Betfair is 155p better at \u00a383.35 after analysts At Berenberg raised their recommendation from sell to hold and their target price from \u00a375 to \u00a383.",

    "webTitle": "City regulator to crack down on crowdfunding", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The City regulator has announced a crackdown on crowdfunding \u2013 the fast-growing sector that lets businesses and individuals raise money from online investors. The Financial Conduct Authority said it had concerns about loan-based businesses \u2013 also known as peer-to-peer (P2P) lenders \u2013 and investment-based platforms. It said it was examining online alternative finance to take account of the UK market\u2019s rapid growth from \u00a31.7bn of loans, investments and donations in 2014 to \u00a33.2bn last year. Peer-to-peer operators, including Zopa and Funding Circle, cut out banks by matching borrowers and lenders. Investment-based platforms such as Crowdcube let companies sell shares and bonds to investors who are often enthusiasts for their products. BrewDog, the self-styled punk brewer, has raised \u00a326m from UK beer drinkers using crowdfunding. The FCA said it was difficult for investors to understand the risks and returns of crowdfunding, marketing material was sometimes unclear and misleading, and some firms did not manage risks and conflicts of interest properly. It took over regulation of crowdfunding in April 2014 and its proposed changes stem from a review of rules that it announced in July. The government has encouraged the growth of the sector, particularly peer-to-peer lending, as an additional source of capital for new businesses. Andrew Bailey, the FCA\u2019s chief executive, said rule tightening would be aimed mainly at peer-to-peer lenders because they have changed a great deal in the past year. By introducing provision funds to cover bad debts and attracting institutional investors, peer-to-peer lenders have become more like banks and asset managers but without the regulation that covers those industries, he said. \u201cWe have seen substantial innovation in the loan-based crowdfunding market. What we are trying to do is strike the right balance between enabling innovation and protecting consumers,\u201d Bailey said. Provision funds may give investors the incorrect belief their money is safe because they are not covered by the government\u2019s deposit protection scheme, the FCA said. Some firms do not have solid plans in place if they fail and the regulator has told some lenders to improve how they handle clients\u2019 money. Bailey said: \u201cAre they marketed transparently? We\u2019ve seen firms which say: \u2018We\u2019ve got a reserve fund and no one has lost money on our platform.\u2019 But there is no guarantee.\u201d The FCA will next year sound out new rules to address the problems it has found. The regulator has proposed higher standards of disclosure by all crowdfunders and stricter rules on wind-down plans for peer-to-peer lenders. Christine Farnish, who chairs the P2P Finance Association industry group, said she welcomed the FCA\u2019s review if it used evidence to assess the sector. \u201cIn any dynamic market regulators need to keep the regulatory regime under close review,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is not easy for a regulator to grapple with new market entrants, especially when they are disrupting traditional business models and challenging powerful incumbents.\u201d Zopa was the first peer-to-peer lender when it launched in 2005 to bring consumer lenders and borrowers together. The sector took off as banks withdrew lending during the financial crisis, spawning imitators and new types of business such as Funding Circle, which lets people lend to small businesses. Bailey said the FCA had received about 375 applications from peer-to-peer lenders of which 17 were fully authorised, 284 were withdrawn and the rest were waiting for full approval. He said the large number of withdrawn applications showed many operators had morphed into other businesses or had not understood the requirements. The FCA\u2019s action on crowdfunding is the latest in a series of interventions by the regulator since Bailey took over as chief executive in July. It has proposed measures to increase competition between fund managers, tougher regulation of high-cost consumer credit, and a clampdown on the spread-betting industry.",

      "body": "<p>The City regulator has announced a crackdown on crowdfunding \u2013 the fast-growing sector that lets businesses and individuals raise money from online investors.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/feedback/fs16-13.pdf\">The Financial Conduct Authority said it had concerns about loan-based businesses</a> \u2013 also known as peer-to-peer (P2P) lenders \u2013 and investment-based platforms. It said it was examining online alternative finance to take account of the UK market\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.nesta.org.uk/sites/default/files/pushing_boundaries_0.pdf\">rapid growth from \u00a31.7bn of loans, investments and donations in 2014 to \u00a33.2bn last year</a>.</p> <p>Peer-to-peer operators, including Zopa and Funding Circle, cut out banks by matching borrowers and lenders. Investment-based platforms such as <a href=\"https://www.crowdcube.com/\">Crowdcube</a> let companies sell shares and bonds to investors who are often enthusiasts for their products. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/04/brewdog-us-expansion-scottish-punk-brewer-crowdfunding\">BrewDog, the self-styled punk brewer, has raised \u00a326m from UK beer drinkers</a> using crowdfunding.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/18/fca-fund-management-fee-investment-consultant\">FCA to shake up fund management to get better deal for investors</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The FCA said it was difficult for investors to understand the risks and returns of crowdfunding, marketing material was sometimes unclear and misleading, and some firms did not manage risks and conflicts of interest properly. </p> <p>It took over regulation of crowdfunding in April 2014 and its proposed changes stem from a review of rules that it announced in July. The government has encouraged the growth of the sector, particularly peer-to-peer lending, as an additional source of capital for new businesses.</p> <p>Andrew Bailey, the FCA\u2019s chief executive, said rule tightening would be aimed mainly at peer-to-peer lenders because they have changed a great deal in the past year. By introducing provision funds to cover bad debts and attracting institutional investors, peer-to-peer lenders have become more like banks and asset managers but without the regulation that covers those industries, he said.</p> <p>\u201cWe have seen substantial innovation in the loan-based crowdfunding market. What we are trying to do is strike the right balance between enabling innovation and protecting consumers,\u201d Bailey said.</p> <p>Provision funds may give investors the incorrect belief their money is safe because they are not covered by the government\u2019s deposit protection scheme, the FCA said. Some firms do not have solid plans in place if they fail and the regulator has told some lenders to improve how they handle clients\u2019 money.<br></p> <p>Bailey said: \u201cAre they marketed transparently? We\u2019ve seen firms which say: \u2018We\u2019ve got a reserve fund and no one has lost money on our platform.\u2019 But there is no guarantee.\u201d</p> <p>The FCA will next year sound out new rules to address the problems it has found. The regulator has proposed higher standards of disclosure by all crowdfunders and stricter rules on wind-down plans for peer-to-peer lenders.<br></p> <p>Christine Farnish, who chairs the P2P Finance Association industry group, said she welcomed the FCA\u2019s review if it used evidence to assess the sector.</p> <p>\u201cIn any dynamic market regulators need to keep the regulatory regime under close review,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is not easy for a regulator to grapple with new market entrants, especially when they are disrupting traditional business models and challenging powerful incumbents.\u201d</p> <p>Zopa was the first peer-to-peer lender when it launched in 2005 to bring consumer lenders and borrowers together.

      "bodyText": "Mining magnate Gina Rinehart\u2019s joint venture with a Chinese company will buy S Kidman &amp; Co, Australia\u2019s biggest agricultural property, after the treasurer approved the sale. On Friday Scott Morrison announced he had approved the bid from Australian Outback Beef, which is 67% owned by Rinehart\u2019s Hancock Beef and 33% owned by Shanghai CRED. The largest station in the Kidman group, Anna Creek in South Australia, and its outstation The Peake, will be bought by the Williams family, a local farming family with adjoining properties. The rest will be sold to the joint venture. Morrison said the deal increased Australian ownership in the properties currently part of the Kidman group from 66.1% to 74.7%. Rinehart said the purchase would put her company in the top three beef producers in Australia, with a combined herd size growing to about 300,000 head. The company planned to invest in technology and infrastructure with the potential to create 100 jobs in regional communities. \u201cThe treasurer\u2019s approach to the sale of Kidman enabled a local Australian company to pay a fair market price and retain Kidman in Australian control,\u201d she said. The Australian-owned Hancock will control the board and day-to-day operation of the business, which will remain incorporated and headquartered in South Australia. Existing environmental and other commitments will be honoured. \u201cConsistent with the recommendation from the foreign investment review board (Firb), I have decided that the acquisition of Kidman as proposed would not be contrary to the national interest and will be permitted to proceed as proposed,\u201d Morrison said. The treasurer said the sale process had been \u201cextensive and heavily scrutinised\u201d, referring to two decisions blocking the sale to foreign investors on national security grounds first in November 2015 then to a Chinese-owned consortium in April. Security concerns that influenced the earlier rejections had been mitigated by excising Anna Creek, the largest single property holding in Australia, from the sale. Part of Anna Creek is in the Woomera protected area in South Australia. In October the joint venture knocked out a syndicate of Australian graziers by increasing its bid to $386.5m. Greg Campbell, Kidman\u2019s managing director, said staff and management were excited about entering into a \u201cnew and transformational phase\u201d of the business. \u201cI know I speak not only for myself but for many Kidman employees when I say we are pleased that Hancock, a highly respected Australian company, leads the joint venture that has received key approvals to acquire Kidman,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cMrs Gina Rinehart is a prominent Australian and we appreciate her desires to further invest and grow the business.\u201d The company also welcomed the commitment to keep the Kidman head office in Adelaide. Kidman is one of Australia\u2019s largest beef producers, with pastoral leases covering 101,000 sq km across South Australia, Western Australia, Northern Territory and Queensland. There are 19 individual properties operated as 12 enterprises \u2013 10 cattle stations, a bull breeding stud farm and a feedlot. The divestment of Anna Creek and The Peake stations will reduce the land area bought by Outback Beef to 77,700 sq km. The approval of the sale is likely to win support from One Nation which had welcomed the Hancock-Shanghai joint venture. The One Nation leader, Pauline Hanson, told the ABC in October: \u201cI would rather Australia have two-thirds in Kidman station, rather than the total ownership and control by the Chinese or any other foreign investor. \u201cCongratulations to Gina Rinehart for actually taking up and buying Kidman.\u201d But independent lower house MP Bob Katter expressed outrage on Friday, accusing the treasurer of selling out the country by approving the deal. \u201cDoes anyone seriously think that Shanghai CRED, with its parent company having put in a bid for the whole lot, [are] going to settle for a third?\u201d Morrison said any future changes in ownership, including any increase in interest by Shanghai CRED, will require subsequent Firb and treasurer approval.",
