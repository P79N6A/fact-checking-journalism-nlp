Love is not enough for Marks &amp; Spencer: it is putting Wi-Fi into 10 shops so shoppers can zap QR codes (those odd little coded black boxes) with their mobile phones. One looks to good old Bradford-based Morrisons for relief from this parade of technology-obsessives and their talk about \"engaging\" with customers. Morrison's doesn't do online groceries and is only starting to experiment with convenience stores; indeed, its most eye-catching move recently has been the purchase of a fish-processing factory in Grimsby. Hurrah for the old-fashioned ways. Not so fast. Morrisons boss Dalton Philips has caught the bug too. He's also promising multi-format, multi-channel retailing to respond to new trends. He has no choice, of course, since big retailers' shared analysis that the internet has changed shopping habits forever seems entirely correct. In Morrisons' case, the interesting part is how this latecomer to the party opts to join. Philips seems to have made a smart move in buying Kiddicare, an online retailer of baby-related goods. That sounds a good way to beat up struggling Mothercare while learning a few online tricks. But what about online groceries? Officially, the jury is out.

So either shareholders are suffering in the form of lower profits, or existing customers in the shops are paying higher prices; neither is attractive. On the one hand, Philips sounds eager to party. Morrisons has bought a stake in a successful New York online food business called Fresh Direct and Philips has dispatched a team of top operatives to learn the magic. Yet he concedes that what works in New York may not apply in North Yorkshire. In the UK, different regional models may be required \u2013 and that's if Morrisons conclude the arithmetic even adds up.

The honest truth about the future, though, is nobody really knows what level of return will be earned by the capital now being directed at transforming established retail giants.

It has also seen operations devastated by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/may/11/toyota-profit-hit-by-japan-earthquake\" title=\"\">last year's earthquake and tsunami in Japan</a> and floods in Thailand, where many parts are made.</p> <p>Pummelled by natural disasters, faulty vehicles and the high yen, which makes exports expensive, Toyota warned in December 2011 that profit would be less than half what it was in 2010. Sales have been hit hard, and the firm has lost market share to resurgent US rivals.</p> <p>No longer is Toyota the largest carmaker in the world \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/jan/24/toyota-world-number-one-carmaker\" title=\"\">General Motors had grabbed back the title it lost in 2008 after decades of American hegemony</a>, while Germany's Volkswagen has overtaken Toyota in Europe and is winning awards for reliability and design.</p> <p>Colin Couchman, a senior analyst at IHS Automotive, said: \"The latest Toyota recalls are the last thing the company needs, as it undermines claims they have turned a corner and will attract the sort of attention the firm could do without.\"</p> <p>He added: \"Toyota has lost market share in North America, with the Koreans making gains when it comes to smaller vehicles, and GM lifting sales of trucks and SUVs.</p> <p>\"The playing field has evened out in America, with US companies coming up with a lineup so good they don't have to discount as much as they did.\"</p> <p>Instead, the Japanese need to cut prices to claw back what they have lost. This is a relatively new dynamic and \"it's going to be intriguing to see how it plays out,\" he said.</p> <p>The latest recalls, disclosed by Toyota on Thursday, include about 495,000 Tacoma trucks, made between 2005 and 2009, which need to have their steering wheel spiral cable assemblies replaced.</p> <p>Toyota said friction may occur between the assembly's spiral cable and the retainer in some vehicles and, over time, cut the connection to the driver's airbag.</p> <p>In addition, it is recalling about 70,500 Camry sedans made during 2009 and about 116,000 Venza crossovers made between 2009 and 2011 to replace lamp switches.</p> <p>The company said it would notify affected owners when it was obtaining replacement parts, which it would fit for free. It said it was not aware of any accidents or injuries caused by the problems.</p> <p>The company's carefully cultivated image as safe and reliable has taken a beating. The setbacks have dented public confidence and left senior management embarrassed, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/feb/25/toyota-akio-toyoda-congress\" title=\"\">culminating two years ago in an appearance by then chief executive Akio Toyoda before a US congressional committee, during which he apologised repeatedly for the faults</a>. There were 14 separate recalls involving Toyota vehicles in 2010 alone.</p> <p>In 2010, Toyota was fined $32.4m (\u00a320.9m) by the US government for failing to swiftly recall millions of vehicles with faulty brakes and steering. Those fines were the maximum allowed by law. Toyota paid another $16.4m fine related to the recalls, bringing the total to $48.8m.</p> <p>Another investigation was prompted by the fatal crash of a California highway patrol officer, Mark Saylor, and his family.

      "bodyText": "As a byword for reliability and safety, Toyota conquered the ferociously competitive global car market to become the number one manufacturer in the world. But the Japanese company that once could do no wrong suffered yet another blow to its battered reputation when it said it was recalling 681,500 vehicles in the US due to safety concerns. Toyota has now recalled more than 10m vehicles in the past three years as a litany of technical problems have bedevilled a manufacturer once renowned as a pioneer of production knowhow. It has also seen operations devastated by last year's earthquake and tsunami in Japan and floods in Thailand, where many parts are made. Pummelled by natural disasters, faulty vehicles and the high yen, which makes exports expensive, Toyota warned in December 2011 that profit would be less than half what it was in 2010. Sales have been hit hard, and the firm has lost market share to resurgent US rivals. No longer is Toyota the largest carmaker in the world \u2013 General Motors had grabbed back the title it lost in 2008 after decades of American hegemony, while Germany's Volkswagen has overtaken Toyota in Europe and is winning awards for reliability and design. Colin Couchman, a senior analyst at IHS Automotive, said: \"The latest Toyota recalls are the last thing the company needs, as it undermines claims they have turned a corner and will attract the sort of attention the firm could do without.\" He added: \"Toyota has lost market share in North America, with the Koreans making gains when it comes to smaller vehicles, and GM lifting sales of trucks and SUVs. \"The playing field has evened out in America, with US companies coming up with a lineup so good they don't have to discount as much as they did.\" Instead, the Japanese need to cut prices to claw back what they have lost. This is a relatively new dynamic and \"it's going to be intriguing to see how it plays out,\" he said. The latest recalls, disclosed by Toyota on Thursday, include about 495,000 Tacoma trucks, made between 2005 and 2009, which need to have their steering wheel spiral cable assemblies replaced. Toyota said friction may occur between the assembly's spiral cable and the retainer in some vehicles and, over time, cut the connection to the driver's airbag. In addition, it is recalling about 70,500 Camry sedans made during 2009 and about 116,000 Venza crossovers made between 2009 and 2011 to replace lamp switches. The company said it would notify affected owners when it was obtaining replacement parts, which it would fit for free. It said it was not aware of any accidents or injuries caused by the problems. The company's carefully cultivated image as safe and reliable has taken a beating. The setbacks have dented public confidence and left senior management embarrassed, culminating two years ago in an appearance by then chief executive Akio Toyoda before a US congressional committee, during which he apologised repeatedly for the faults. There were 14 separate recalls involving Toyota vehicles in 2010 alone. In 2010, Toyota was fined $32.4m (\u00a320.9m) by the US government for failing to swiftly recall millions of vehicles with faulty brakes and steering. Those fines were the maximum allowed by law. Toyota paid another $16.4m fine related to the recalls, bringing the total to $48.8m. Another investigation was prompted by the fatal crash of a California highway patrol officer, Mark Saylor, and his family. They died after reporting a stuck accelerator while driving a 2009 Lexus ES 350. Despite its travails, Toyota has returned to normal production and seen a revival in its sales in the US, one of its biggest markets. According to the latest data, Toyota's US sales increased by 12% in February from a year earlier. Analysts said the upward trend was likely to continue in the coming months despite the latest recall. [This update was inserted on 13 March 2012: A Toyota representative adds that \"the US government investigations by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and engineers at the National Aeronautical and Safety Administration into unintended acceleration both concluded that there were no real-world scenarios in which Toyota electronics can cause unintended acceleration and both closed their investigations into this matter in 2011.\"] But one problem that is not going away is the strength of yen, still relatively high against the dollar. A strong yen means a \u2260dip in the value of repatriated profits for big exporters such as Toyota, as well as putting their products at a competitive pricing disadvantage in export markets. \u2022 This article was updated on 13 March 2012 to include information from Toyota about the outcome of US inquiries into the accelerator question.",

    "webTitle": "Low interest rates and QE: the winners and losers", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Bank of England has marked the third anniversary of its decision to cut interest rates to 0.5% and begin an electronic money creation programme by leaving policy on an ultra-loose setting. Faced with a stubbornly weak economy, the City sees no prospect of Threadneedle Street tightening its monetary stance before the end of next year at the earliest, even though the lowest bank rate in history and the announcement of \u00a3325bn of quantitative easing have created losers as well as winners. Winners Mortgage payers: Cheap money has fed through into less expensive home loans, with particularly hefty gains for those on floating rate mortgages. For those in this group who held onto their jobs during the worst of the recession in the winter of 2008-09, there were sizeable reductions in their monthly repayments as bank rate came down from 5% to 0.5%. Although the full benefits were not passed on to mortgage payers by lenders, the reductions helped underpin consumer spending and limited home repossessions. In recent days, however, some of the biggest lenders have announced sharp increases in their standard variable mortgage rates. Exporters: The low level of interest rates, coupled with the increase in the money supply, has made sterling less attractive to investors. A weaker pound makes UK exports cheaper, providing a boost to manufacturing and those parts of the service sector that trade overseas. Much of the fall in sterling, however, took place before March 2009. Asset holders: An explicit aim of rock-bottom interest rates and the QE programme was to make it less attractive for people to hold on to cash. The Bank assumed that investors would seek out higher yields in property, the stock market, and commodities. Higher asset prices would, Threadneedle Street said, make people feel wealthier and thus increase economic confidence. Banks: Banks have been beneficiaries of the QE programme because they have been able to exchange assets \u2013 mainly government gilts \u2013 for cash, which they have used to repair balance sheets damaged during the financial crisis. The expected increase in bank lending to individuals and businesses as a result of stronger balance sheets has not, however, materialised. Losers Savers: The flipside to the gains for mortgage payers has been three years of pain for savers. Interest rates have collapsed, making life tougher for those \u2013 especially pensioners \u2013 dependent on the interest on nest eggs built up over their lifetime. The annual incomes of many pensioners are closely linked to official interest rates and groups representing savers have become increasingly vociferous in their criticism of the Bank of England. Pension funds: Shortfalls in pension funds have increased as a result of QE. When the price of a government gilt goes up, the interest rate (or yield) goes down, and the effect of the Bank's \u00a3325bn asset purchase programme has been to reduce the supply of government bonds, pushing up their price. Gilt yields, which are used as a rule-of-thumb guide to the future income of pension funds and of the likely inflation rate, have crashed, thus widening pension shortfalls. Consumers: One of the unintended side-effects of low interest rates and QE has been rising global commodity prices as investors sought out higher-yielding assets. Speculation in the oil market led to a near-doubling of the price of crude between early 2009 and early 2010, with food prices also rising sharply. Exacerbated by the weak pound, the annual inflation rate rose to above 5%, which squeezed consumer spending power and put the brake on economic recovery. Emerging markets: QE weakened currencies in developed countries such as the US and the UK, but led to higher exchange rates in some of the bigger emerging markets, such as Brazil and Mexico, leading to weaker exports, slower growth, the introduction of capital controls and the threat of currency wars.",

Reuters quotes a London-based trader: Given Hammerson's French exposure, this Kl\u00e9pierre deal is sure to provide a boost to valuations and sentiment for the UK-listed firm. BNP Paribas said it would sell a 28.7% stake Kl\u00e9pierre to raise \u20ac1.5bn (\u00a31.3bn) as part of the bank's efforts to increase capital reserves. The bank posted a 51% drop in profits in the last quarter of 2011, hit by the eurozone debt crisis. Kl\u00e9pierre shares rose 5%, while BNP Paribas was 4% higher. European equities are up. The German Dax is 2% higher, while the French CAC 40 is up 2%. The European Central Bank just announced that rates would stay unchanged at 1%. There's a press conference to follow at 1.30pm, when we might get some indication of the bank's plans for Europe's version of QE, the LTRO. Live coverage here. As expected, the Bank of England left interest rates at 0.5% at midday, with QE unchanged at \u00a3325bn. Markets were expecting it to be a non-event and there was no discernible reaction. Philip Shaw at Investec said: Any other outcome would have been a huge surprise.",
