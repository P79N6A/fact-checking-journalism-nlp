      "bodyText": "Thousands of jobs in Northern Ireland appear to have been saved after plane maker Bombardier won a legal battle in the US that has overturned damaging import tariffs on its C-series aircraft. On Friday the US International Trade Commission (ITC) voted unanimously against Boeing in favour of its Canadian rival Bombardier after Donald Trump\u2019s administration had threatened to impose duties of 292%. The decision defied the expectations of both the British government and trade unions in Northern Ireland. Theresa May spoke with Trump over the dispute at the World Economic Forum in Davos, where the prime minister is reported to have reiterated the importance of Bombardier to the Northern Irish economy. Boeing had complained to US authorities that the C-series jets were being sold to the US airline Delta below their production cost and had been given illegal subsidies from the UK and Canadian governments. But the commission voted 4-0 in favour of Bombardier against Boeing, which had raised a complaint about the Canadian manufacturer receiving state subsidies. Boeing had won a ruling in the US that resulted in the imposition of the tariff on Bombardier\u2019s jets, which were built for a number of US airlines. \u201cToday\u2019s decision is a victory for innovation, competition and the rule of law. It is also a victory for US airlines and the US travelling public,\u201d Bombardier said. \u201cThe C-series is the most innovative and efficient new aircraft in a generation. Its development and production represent thousands of jobs in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom. \u201cWe are extremely proud of our employees, investors and suppliers, who have worked together to bring this remarkable aircraft to the market. With this matter behind us, we are moving full speed ahead with finalising our partnership with Airbus. \u201cIntegration planning is going well and we look forward to delivering the C-series to the US market so that US airlines and the US flying public can enjoy the many benefits of this remarkable aircraft.\u201d After the ITC\u2019s decision May said: \u201cI welcome this decision, which is good news for British industry.\u201d Business secretary Greg Clark added: \u201cThe decision by the International Trade Commission confirms what the UK and Canadian governments working hand in hand has maintained from the outset, that this case is unjustified.\u201d The Unite union in Northern Ireland said on Friday night that workers were \u201cjubilant\u201d over the ruling. Steve Turner, a Unite assistant general secretary, said the victory was a result of political pressure arising from the trade union movement\u2019s campaign to save thousands of jobs in Belfast, where Bombardier builds the wings for the C-series jets. Turner said: \u201cBombardier workers in Northern Ireland and throughout the supply chain in the UK will be breathing a huge sigh of relief that the International Trade Commission has seen though Boeing\u2019s baseless complaint. When the going got tough, Unite did not thrown in the towel. Our members and shop stewards redoubled their efforts in bringing pressure to bear on politicians in Washington, Westminster, Brussels and Northern Ireland.\u201d He added that there could now be \u201cno backsliding\u201d by the Trump administration and that the US government would have to accept the ITC decision. The Democratic Unionist MP for Belfast East, Gavin Robinson, said he was \u201cabsolutely delighted\u201d. \u201cIt was an amazing result and a massive relief for the staff. The C-series is now ready for takeoff.\u201d Naomi Long, the Alliance party MLA for Belfast East, also welcomed the ruling. \u201cI hope it is the end of the matter, which has been highly disruptive to Bombardier and extremely stressful for local employees of the company and those working in the supply chain. We need to ensure the organisation can now proceed with the construction and supply of one of the most innovative aircraft on the global market.\u201d Bombardier employs about 1,000 people in Belfast linked to the C-series, and about 4,000 people in total in Northern Ireland. The programme is also crucial to 15 smaller aerospace firms in the region which make components for the wings.",

    "webTitle": "IMF chief warns Trump's tax cuts could destabilise global economy", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Donald Trump\u2019s huge tax cuts are a threat to the stability of the global economy, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund has warned. Christine Lagarde singled out Trump\u2019s tax reforms as one of three risks that could destabilise the current economic recovery, especially given the boom in stock markets in the past year. \u201cWhile the US tax reforms certainly will have positive effects in the short term, for the US and other countries around, it might also lead to serious risks,\u201d Lagarde told the World Economic Forum in Davos. \u201cThat has an impact on financial vulnerability, particularly given the high asset prices that we see around the world, and the easy financing that it still available,\u201d she added. She was speaking shortly after the US president told Davos that his tax reforms had created \u201ca big, beautiful waterfall\u201d of pay rises for US workers, as American companies passed the tax cut on. However, the IMF is concerned that cutting taxes will lead to a bigger US budget deficit, and that extra borrowing by the US Treasury will force up long-term American interest rates. As a result, it fears growth could be choked off in the longer term, making the stock market vulnerable to a sudden downward lurch. Lagarde cautioned against people becoming too complacent about the pick-up in global growth reported by the IMF at the start of the WEF\u2019s annual meeting. The IMF raised its forecasts for global expansion to 3.9% this year and in 2019, reporting that all major economies \u2013 the US, the eurozone and Japan \u2013 are doing better. \u201cI don\u2019t think that we\u2019ve completed the job,\u201d said Lagarde, who fears that the growing economic inequality in many countries is creating \u201cfractures\u201d. \u201cHaving growth is good, improving productive is good, but [policymakers should] make sure that the results of that growth are properly allocated,\u201d said the IMF chief, adding that inequality is growing in many advanced economies, and very high in emerging markets. In addition to financial instability and inequality, Lagarde said a third risk was the lack of international cooperation and the geopolitical risks that could be created as a result. Lagarde was speaking at the final session of the week-long Davos meeting, alongside the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney. Carney warned that the risk of a fall in asset prices had increased, but the financial system was in better shape to cope than it was 10 years ago because regulators had made banks hold more capital. Carney said the global expansion was getting stronger, broader and healthier, with most of the acceleration in G7 growth due to investment and net trade. \u201cThis is not a consumer boom-led recovery,\u201d said Carney, who also suggested that wage growth should pick up soon. \u201cIf you look at wage behaviour in the US, in the UK, you see a firming of wages,\u201d he added. The Bank of Japan governor, Haruhiko Kuroda, was also on the panel, and said that Japanese inflation was finally getting close to target. \u201cThere are some indications that wages are actually rising and some prices have started to rise,\u201d Kuroda said. \u201cThere are many factors that made the 2% target difficult and time-consuming but we are finally close.\u201d The rise in global growth and inflation is putting pressure on central bankers to unwind the unprecedented money-printing operations launched after the financial crisis nearly a decade ago. Some economists fear that quantitative easing \u2013 where central banks buy bonds from financial institutions \u2013 has created inflationary pressures, as well as driving asset prices to new peaks. Speaking earlier in the day at Davos, the UBS chairman, Axel Weber, predicted that unwinding this stimulus would not be easy. \u201cWe are in pretty uncharted territory. Exiting from QE [quantitative easing] will be a difficult exercise,\u201d Weber said. Although stock markets hit fresh record highs again this week, the currency markets were thrown into turmoil after the US treasury secretary, Stephen Mnuchin, said a weak dollar was good for US trade. Those remarks sent it sliding to a three-year low and prompted a frosty response from the European Central Bank\u2019s president, Mario Draghi.",

      "bodyText": "John Lewis is putting personal shoppers for men into at least eight more stores after the service proved a success at its Oxford premises. The group\u2019s first men\u2019s stylist accounted for a third of all personal shopping appointments since the Oxford store opened in October. A men\u2019s stylist will be among 23 services on offer at the group\u2019s \u00a333m new store in west London, which is scheduled to open in March, its first department store opening since an outlet in Leeds two years ago. The store is still a building site but is already decked out with many of its fittings, including a beauty parlour, a community events room and a demonstration kitchen. Maggie Porteous, director of shop trade at John Lewis, said it was \u201creinventing the department store for the 21st century \u2026 We want this shop to create a day out.\u201d The store, part of the extension of the Westfield shopping centre in west London, will open as high street retailers, particularly department stores, come under pressure from an increase in online shopping. House of Fraser and Debenhams are considering closing space, and John Lewis\u2019s has warned about its profits. Porteous said the store would benefit from being part of the revamped Westfield, which would include a bowling venue. Many of the services tested at the Oxford store will be expanded at White City, including a nail and eyebrow bar and spaces for events such as catwalk shows. \u201cWhite City and John Lewis are a destination that customers are really looking for which is a real experience. I think this will be very successful,\u201d she said. Events and services will be marketed through an upgraded version of the \u201cexperience desk\u201d trialled in Oxford, where a concierge helps customers book appointments. John Lewis is recruiting 600 people to work at the 230,000 sq ft store. They will undergo weeks of training, including a new version of the acting lessons first tried in Oxford.",

      "bodyText": "Whether Donald Trump was right or not in his comments about the US stock market, there was no denying it was racing ahead today. Even weaker than expected US fourth quarter GDP figures failed to hold back the Dow, which jumped to another new high of 26,497. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: Fresh highs for US markets come as investors keep a close eye on the US president\u2019s comments in Davos. Someone appears to have carefully written Mr Trump\u2019s remarks with a view to making him more palatable to foreign leaders, reasoning that a more conciliatory tone will produce results. The dollar recovered from its lowest levels, after being buffeted in the last couple of days by, firstly the US Treasury secretary seeming unconcerned about a weak greenback and then Trump himself talking about wanting a strong dollar. Connor Campbell financial analyst at Spreadex said: Combined with Donald Trump\u2019s uncontroversial Davos address, and a recalculation of Steven Mnuchin\u2019s \u2018weaker dollar\u2019 comments after the very negative (over)reaction on Wednesday, the greenback actually reduced its losses against the pound from 1% to just 0.2%, while chopping down its decline against the euro to 0.3%, a third of what it was earlier in the session. The recovery in the dollar helped give a lift to European markets, which ended the day (mostly) in positive territory. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 49.70 points or 0.65% at 7665.54 Germany\u2019s Dax rose 0.31% to 13,340.17 France\u2019s Cac climbed 0.88% to 5529.15 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB was 0.58% better at 23,856.99 But Spain\u2019s Ibex ended flat at 10,595.4 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 89 points or 0.34%. On that note it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back next week. Here\u2019s someone happy with Donald Trump\u2019s performance at Davos: Here\u2019s our report of Donald Trump\u2019s appearance at Davos. Larry Elliott writes: Donald Trump took his battle with the media onto the global stage when he used a speech in Davos declaring that America was open for business to accuse his press and TV critics of being mean, vicious and purveyors of fake news. Part of the normally respectful audience of business leaders, politicians, academics and media representatives at the World Economic Forum responded to the president\u2019s renewed onslaught on his media critics by hissing. Speaking to a packed hall, the US president boasted of his record since entering the White House and stressed that there had never been a better time for firms to hire and build in the low tax and red-tape cutting economy he was creating. Trump made his address as the latest US growth figures showed the economy growing at an annual rate of 2.6% in the final three months of 2017, weaker than the 3% Wall Street had been expecting. \u201cThe world is witnessing the resurgence of a strong and prosperous America\u201d, he said. \u201cI\u2019m here to deliver a simple message. There has never been a better time to hire, to build, to invest and to grow in the United States. America is open for business and we are competitive once again.\u201d The full report is here: Here\u2019s the verdict on Trump from the president of the Council on Foreign Relations think tank: The White House claims that Trump\u2019s jibe at the media was received with laughter in the Davos hall: Here\u2019s their official transcript of the president\u2019s remarks during the Q&amp;A after his speech. The other thing is, I\u2019ve always seemed to get, for whatever reason, a disproportionate amount of press or media. (Laughter.) Throughout my whole life -- somebody will explain someday why -- but I\u2019ve always gotten a lot. (Laughter.) And as businessman I was always treated really well by the press. The numbers speak and things happen, but I\u2019ve always really had a very good press. And it wasn\u2019t until I became a politician that I realized how nasty, how mean, how vicious, and how fake the press can be. As the cameras start going off in the background. (Laughter.) That\u2019s not how we, or many other people in the hall, heard it. Back with the global economy panel, and Bank of England governor Mark Carney is asked about the path forward for monetary policy. He begins by saying the nature of the recovery is stronger, broader and healthier. This is not a consumer boom led recovery. As you get towards full employment, the pickup [in wages] should be there. There is that aspect pushing towards normalisation of policy. The second element is investment picking up, savings down. The third is the stance of policy as a whole of the G4, the members of the G7 practising QE. We\u2019ve shifted collectively between 2013 to 2017 from bonds being taken out, to this year $1tn of net issuance, that should push up on rates. You have a very tough judgement about where is the equilibrium rate of interest, which has been very very low and arguably should be raising a bit. One has a sense of direction towards normalisation but we have to be patient and prudent in making those judgements. Lastly, the UK is in a relatively unique situation, in that over the course of the next year as negotiations with EU progress, we will find out a lot more about what the supply capacity of the economy is , what right level of the exchange rate is, whether there will be tariff or other trade costs and how all of this effects demand. All those factors together will determinate the appropriate stance for monetary policy. Carney is asked whether there is an asset bubble [caused by QE etc] which will burst and lead to meltdown. How likely is that on a scale of 1 to 10? Carney admits the probability for an adjustment in asset prices has gone up [since prices have increased since the financial crisis]. The big question is whether the core of the financial system is in a position to amplify that in negative way. I would put that as quite low. The capital and liquid positions of institutions have been improved [since financial crisis]. Winnie Byanyima, Director of Oxfam International, says: \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s boastful sales pitch was a victory lap for the trillions of tax cuts that the wealthy elites and corporations have clamored for. The evidence is clear: these tax cuts are looting the US treasury to enrich the 1%. \u201cYes, global markets are breaking records, but gains are overwhelmingly going to the richest, while leaving the rest of the world to fight over crumbs.\u201d Davide Serra, the chief executive of asset management group Algebris, has welcomed Trump\u2019s speech: Heads-up: I\u2019ve updated my earlier post about the stock market gains under Trump. If you take the Dow from election night in November 2016 to today, it is up around 44%. Since the inauguration it\u2019s up 31%, but to be fair to Donald Trump the rally started straight after his election. Still not 50%, but Trump\u2019s claim isn\u2019t too outlandish. Donald Trump\u2019s trip to Davos is over. The White House press pool say that the US had an \u201cuneventful motorcade to the Davos Landing Zone\u201d The president has boarded Marine One, ready to head back to Zurich. Beatrice Fihn, Executive Director of ICAN (the international campaign to abolish nuclear weapons) says: \u201cDonald Trump just said we have to de-nuke North Korea. Rather than trying to threaten them with more nukes and make it more likely to use them, the best way he can make sure North Korea does not have nuclear weapons is to join the Treaty to ban those weapons. That is how the majority of the world is moving towards nuclear disarmament.\u201d Trump\u2019s right about one thing - the market has gone up a lot since the last election. By one measure, it\u2019s up by a third: I just spoke to Marc Benioff, the founder and CEO of Salesforce, about Donald Trump\u2019s speech to the World Economic Outlook. He says: I thought it was a great speech. I thought his economic narrative has become greatly enhanced now that the tax cuts have passed. The most important thing that happened this week is that six out of the G7 country leaders were here and that this multi-stakeholder dialogue that\u2019s so important right now was enhanced by the World Economic Forum. Q: Does America First really fit with a multi-stakeholder approach? For the most part, what you see if what you get. Everyone knows what his policy is, and he\u2019s fairly transparent about his positions. Q: Would the stock market have crashed under Hillary? No, I don\u2019t think so. Q: Are the media fake and vicious and mean and nasty? Aren\u2019t we all sometimes? Christine Lagarde is asked what could go wrong, after the IMF forecast improved global growth of 3.9%. She starts by saying the growth is well spread out, and we should celebrate the policies implemented by central banks. What could go wrong? There is financial vulnerability, US tax reform will be positive in the short term but might lead to serious risks. Secondly, the excessive inequalities which are growing in many places. Thirdly, the lack of international co-operation and the geopolitical risks which could result. Turning to the Bank of Japan\u2019s Kuroda, he says the Japanese economy is expanding modestly in a well balanced manner. The 2% growth in the last seven quarters is a substantial improvement. This is the second longest boom in the post war era. The economy is likely to continue its modest expansion. ..The deflationary mindset has been more tenacious than expected, so BoJ will continue to pursue powerful monetary easing with persistence under the quantitative and qualitative monetary easing. There are various risks but from my perspective they are mostly external. There is now a panel on the Global Economic outlook, with Haruhiko Kuroda, the governor of the Bank of Japan, Bank of England governor Mark Carney, Hong Kong chief executive Carrie Lam, IMF managing director Christine Lagarde and Mary Callahan Erdoes, chief executive officer of J.P. Morgan Asset Management. It is chaired by the FT\u2019s Martin Wolf. More on the US GDP figures, which came in below expectations in the fourth quarter. Economist James Knightley at ING Bank said: US fourth quarter GDP has come in at 2.6%, a little below the 3% figure expected by the market, but this masks some real strength in the report. Consumer spending was up 3.8% while fixed investment was up 7.9% and government spending jumped 3%. However trade was the surprise weak spot, subtracting 1.1% from headline growth after a surge in imports. This will recover and we doubt it will unleash a new wave of protectionist action from President Trump, who is sounding a little more conciliatory in Davos. Inventories were also heavily run down, which subtracted a further 0.7% from GDP growth. This too will recover given very strong order books as highlighted by very good durable goods orders and bodes well for ongoing job creation. We continue to forecast 3% full year growth for 2018. Strong domestic momentum will be boosted somewhat by tax cuts, while dollar softness puts the US in a great position to benefit from the global upturn in demand. We also see the growing potential for inflation to hit 3% in the summer as high energy prices, the unwinding of distortions relating to cell phone data plans, rising medical and housing costs and the potential for wage rises add to price pressures. Consequently, our current forecast of three Fed funds rate rises this year may be too conservative. Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, said: President Donald Trump will be disappointed today after the fourth-quarter GDP figures showed his initial targets have fallen short of the mark, but the US is still on a sound financial footing. The Trump administration had targeted 3% growth but despite the latest figures falling below expectations, the President still has reasons to be bullish. Nariman Behravesh, the chief economist of consultancy firm IHS Global Insight, tells us: It could have been worse, but he should have stuck to the script. The prepared comments were fine. It was only when he got into the Q&amp;A.... Not everyone agrees.. The speech is over, and attendees are spilling out of the hall. The US delegation are heading away in a bustle of security. I grab a word with Stephen Mnuchin, the US Treasury secretary, and ask him what he made of it. I thought it was fabulous. Great speech. Some reaction: Trump takes a swipe at the journalists at Davos, saying that until he became president he didn\u2019t realise how nasty, how mean, how vicious and how fake the media are. This prompts some boos and hisses - something I\u2019ve not heard before. Updated: Is the stock market really up 50% under president Trump? It depends how you choose to measure it. By my maths, The Dow Jones industrial average has gained around 44% since election night in November 2016. Since Trump actually took office a year ago, the Dow is up 31% - but I think the president is right to include the bounce in November and December 2016. I initially didn\u2019t include that in my maths, so had a lower figure. Apologies. Q: What experiences in your past help you to become president? Trump says his business acumen - his ability to make money. Then he claims that \u201cif the opposing party to me\u201d had won - the stock market wouldn\u2019t be up 50%, it would be down close to 50% People are listening in silence.... As Donald Trump is speaking and hailing his economic success, the latest US GDP figures have disappointed. On an annualised basis the US economy grew by 2.6% in the final quarter rather than the 3% expected, down from 3.2% in the previous three months. NF WEF founder Klaus Schwab asks Donald Trump to expand on his tax reforms. Trump begins by saying he had an enjoyable meeting with European business leaders last night (I think I have 15 new friends, he brags). He says the tax cuts were \u201cvery tough politically\u201d, but are creating a \u201cbrand new United States. People have a lot more money in their paycheque, says Trump - even earlier than the administration expected. We have hit 84 stock market record highs since I became president, Trump adds. Trump says he told Apple\u2019s CEO Tim Cook that he wanted Apple to start building plants in the US. In response, Cook said he\u2019d make a \u201c350\u201d boost - I thought he meant million, not billion. Trump adds that African American unemployment is at historic low, and women\u2019s unemployment is a 17-year low. It\u2019s \u2018very heartwarming to see\u201d. We are all stronger when free, sovereign countries co-operate towards shared goals and shared dreams, says president Trump. He then challenges Davos delegates, saying: In this hall are national leaders, industry titans and many of the brightest minds in many fields. You have an obligation to the people who put you in this position. He ends with a tribute to the \u201chard-working people\u201d in countries across the world. Let us send our love and our gratitude to them, because they make our countries run, they make our country great. That\u2019s it. Onto questions. Onto migration, and Trump says America needs a new \u201cmerit-based system\u201d based on people\u2019s ability to support themselves financially and help grow the US economy. Trump says almost 100% of the land taken by Islamic State has been taken back, and thanks the countries who have helped. Onto defence, and Trump challenges world leaders to spend more in defence. Our common security requires everyone to pay their fair share On North Korea, he calls for \u201cmaximum pressure to de-nuke the Korean peninsula.\u201d...and support to \u201cblock Iran\u2019s path to a nuclear weapon.\u201d Trump says he could negotiate a trade deal with the countries of the Trans-Pacific Partnership as a group - \u201cif it is in the interests of all\u201d (reminder, he pulled the US out of TPP a year ago) Otherwise, Trump says, the US will negotiate bilateral agreements with the countries in TPP. We cannot have free and open trade if some countries exploit the system at the expense of others, Trump says. Free trade \u201cneeds to be fair, and it needs to be reciprocal\u201d The US \u201cwill no longer turn a blind eye\u201d to unfair practices, such as subsidies and pervasive state led economic planning, Trump continues. I believe in America, Trump continues. I will put it first, just as other world leaders should put their countries first. Trump is outlining how his tax cuts plan is helping the economy, by spurring investment and giving workers a pay rise. Now is the perfect time to bring your business, your investment and your jobs to the US, he tells business leaders in the hall. Trump now lays into \u2018unelected bureaucrats\u2019 for imposing anti-business and anti-worker regulations, saying: Regulation is stealth taxation. Trump hails the US economy, saying growth is strong, and the stock market is smashing one record after another. Business, consumer and economic confidence is the highest in decades. The world is witnessing the resurgence of a strong and prosperous America, says the president. I\u2019m here to deliver a simple message, Trump continues - there has never been a better time to invest in America. He says: America is open for business, and we are competitive once again. Trump begins his speech, saying I am here to represent the interests of the American people, and affirm our commitment to helping to build a better world, he says. America wants to help build a world where everyone can prosper, and every child can grow up free from poverty and fear, he says. Wow. Schwab says that Trump has suffered from misconceptions and biased interpretations - prompting some hissing from the audience. Schwab says the world needs to balance the rebuilding of national social contracts, and strengthening the multi-national system to address issues such as terrorism and migration. Guardian Business has launched a daily email covering all the news on Davos, Brexit and more. Besides the key news headlines that you\u2019d expect, there\u2019s an at-a-glance agenda of the day\u2019s main events, insightful opinion pieces and a quality feature to sink your teeth into each day. For your morning shot of financial news, sign up here: WEF founder Klaus Schwab says it is his great pleasure to welcome Donald J Trump to the closing session of this year\u2019s meeting. You can\u2019t imagine how much we are looking forward to your speech, says Schwab (oh I suspect Trump can!). Schwab congratulates Trump on his \u201chistoric\u201d tax reforms, saying it will foster job creation and stimulate economic growth in the US, and a tremendous boost to the global economy. [no mention of concerns that the richest Americans will benefit the most] OK, that was a bit weird. The band are marching off now, and trump is taking a seat. Trump and Schwab are standing to attention on the stage as the band plays on.... Update: it looks like Trump might sit down with WEF founder Klaus Schwab for a chat after all. Donald Trump really is getting the red carpet treatment. A military band with trombones, clarinets, a tube and a really impressive drum have marched onto the stage, to serenade Trump on his arrival. Ukraine\u2019s president takes his seat.... Donald Trump has emerged into the public area at Davos, down the staircase to a MASSIVE crowd of TV camera and reporters. This Trump speech is the hottest ticket since Nelson Mandela (a very different world leader) visited Davos in 1992. WEF\u2019s cavernous hall, which holds 1,800 people, is full to bursting point. No sign of president Trump, though. He\u2019s still in a meeting room in a secure area of the complex. I\u2019ve been coming to WEF for six years, and this is the biggest crowd I remember seeing for a single talk. Of course, Trump is the first US president to visit WEF since Bill Clinton in 2000. Had things turned out differently, Hillary would now be pulling a massive crowd - and probably being welcomed with warmer applause. Earlier, the UK shadow chancellor, John McDonnell was pulling no punches. Larry Elliott writes: [McDonnell] has used his debut appearance at the World Economic Forum to warn leaders of global businesses that they are held in contempt by ordinary voters who have struggled through a decade of austerity. Interviewed by the Guardian in Davos, McDonnell said he found the euphoria in Davos about the modest pick-up in world growth shocking, adding that those running big corporations were guilty of complacency. \u201cYou get the feeling that they are cut off in their compound from what people on the outside are feeling,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is an ecstatic reaction to a turn in the economic cycle that was inevitable. They don\u2019t understand the deep alienation.\u201d The full story is here: Several rows at the front of the hall have been reserved for VIPs (or VVIPs, given this is Davos). There\u2019s a podium for Trump to speak from, but no comfy chairs on the stage. That\u2019s a strong sign that he won\u2019t be taking any questions. Getting to watch Trump\u2019s speech is like visiting a Premier League football match. There\u2019s lot of pushing and queue-jumping, plus an extra bag search before you\u2019re allowed into the hall. The bad news for those the back is that the hall is already two-thirds full..... Davos delegates are splitting into two camps - those who are trying to bag a plum seat (any seat!) for the Trump speech, and those who are more concerned about lunch. The queue to get into the hall is already massive, and the doors aren\u2019t even open yet (media are being let in early). At the other end of the hall, delegates are tucking into a spread of Middle Eastern food The food is provided by the Saudi delegation, who are obviously most welcome at WEF despite their record on human rights and gender equality. Looking ahead to Trump\u2019s actual speech, Oanda market analyst Craig Erlam said: [It] promises to be eventful. Trump is widely expected to push his America first agenda while making the argument for fair and reciprocal trade and claiming the country is now open for business. The visit is clearly an attempt to pitch the country to business leaders following the recent tax overhaul while at the same time reaffirming the US\u2019 position in the world and even perhaps clearing up some of the damage caused by recent unsavoury leaks. Just in: Donald Trump has given an interview to CNBC. The US president says he came to the World Economic Forum to encourage firms to invest in America: So when I decided to come to Davos I didn\u2019t think in terms of elitists or globalists. I think I thought in terms of lots of people that want to invest lots of money, and they\u2019re all coming back to the United States, they\u2019re coming back to America. And I thought of it much more in those terms. After I said that I was going there were massive stories about the elite, and the globalists, and the planes flying in, and everything else. It\u2019s not about that. It\u2019s about coming to America, investing your money, creating jobs, companies coming in. And on trade, Trump slammed the NAFTA pact: I like bilateral because if you have a problem, you terminate. When you\u2019re in with many countries, like with TPP\u2014 so you have 12 if we were in\u2014 you don\u2019t have that same, you know, you don\u2019t have that same option. But somebody asked me other day would I do TPP. Here\u2019s my answer. I\u2019ll give you a big story. I would do TPP if we made a much better deal than we had. We had a horrible deal. The deal was a horrible deal. NAFTA\u2019s a horrible deal, we\u2019re renegotiating it. I may terminate NAFTA, I may not. We\u2019ll see what happens. But NAFTA was and I went around and I\u2019d tell stadiums full of people, \u201cI\u2019ll terminate it or renegotiate it.\u201d Trump himself is continuing to hold meetings at Davos, as delegates wait for his speech in around 90 minutes. On the fluctuations in the dollar, analyst Fawad Razaqzada at Forex.com said: The dollar had been falling sharply in recent days until a sharp turn-around late in the day yesterday after US President Donald Trump said he wanted the currency to rise, as this would be a sign of strength in the US economy. [But the dollar] has now given up most of its gains again as market participants made a more sober assessment of Trump\u2019s comments...Today, the dollar will have a chance to potentially make a comeback in the event US GDP also beats expectations... Even if the data disappoints, one could argue that the downside could be limited for the severely oversold dollar. Here are more quotes from the UK\u2019s shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, on why he\u2019s \u2018deeply interested\u2019 in basic income (the idea that each citizen gets a minimum payment from the state). \u201cWe\u2019re considering it, we\u2019ve got a working group....that will bring forward reports for consultation \u201cThere\u2019s a big debate around basic income or basic services and we\u2019ll encourage that debate.\u201d Having a basic income would give people security, but also even in transitional phases in their life, would give them security as well. \u201cSo I think it is worth examining. Sterling has moved higher following the stronger than expected UK growth figures. The pound is now up 0.69% against the dollar at $1.4244, and is 0.22% better against the euro at \u20ac1.1432. The dollar has been on a bit of a wild ride in the last couple of days, mainly due to comments from Davos. Treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin sent it lower after suggesting he was not really worried about a weak dollar, only for President Trump to express his desire for a strong dollar. That gave some respite to the greenback but it was fairly short lived. Investors are concerned about whether the US tax reforms will add to the country\u2019s already hefty deficit, as well as the prospect of a trade war after Trump\u2019s latest sanctions against South Korea and China on washing machines and solar panels. The latest US GDP figures, due around the time Trump addresses the Davos audience, area likely to cause more fluctuations in the dollar. A slight fall from an annualised growth rate of 3.2% to 3% is expected. NF Trump has apparently been boasting to the White House press pack about his reception at Davos: Trump\u2019s got a point. There\u2019s usually a flicker of interest as a world leader appears in the Davos congress centre (they\u2019re usually flanked by aides, and whisked between meetings). But no-one else gets delegates crowding around for a glimpse - which I\u2019m sure Trump absolutely loves. John McDonnell also warned Davos that an \u2018avalanche\u2019 of public anger is building. McDonnell says: There needs to be a more thorough understanding of the past and what our people have gone through in the last 10 years, and the reaction to that. Look at Brexit. There is an avalanche of discontent and resentment out there. McDonnell also said he was \u201cdeeply interested in the concept of a basic income\u201d, and that Labour was considering it. Labour\u2019s shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, has criticised the Davos elite for their \u201cextraordinary\u201d optimism. He told a debate on free markets that there is \u201cAlmost a sense of euphoria\u201d at the World Economic Forum. He fears it\u2019s also complacency. I\u2019ve come to Davos with a warning, McDonnell says, pointing out that many people aren\u2019t feeling the benefits of the pick-up in global growth. Out there, beyond the Davos compound, many people feel the markets are rigged against them, not for them. I just warn the Davos establishment, there is an anger building that you have to deal with, McDonnell adds. As he arrived at Davos, Trump was also asked about the report he tried to sack special prosecutor Robert Mueller last year. He responded by dismissing it as \u2018fake news\u2019, before heading into his secure meeting area, wishing \u2018good morning\u2019 to the throng. Here\u2019s our story on the UK GDP figures. In 2017 as a whole, the UK\u2019s economy grew by 1.8% compared with 1.9% in 2016, the slowest since 2012. Britain lagged other leading nations due to the impact of the Brexit vote pushing up inflation and businesses turning cautious on investment. Donald Trump has arrived back at the World Economic Forum. As yesterday, scores of curious delegates gathered on the balcony as the Trump team emerged from a secure entrance, and headed up the main staircase. Reporters shouted a few questions - Trump has now headed into a secure room at the congress centre (the same one he used yesterday to meet Theresa May). Year on year, the UK economy grew by 1.5%, compared to expectations of a figure of 1.4% and an annualised third quarter figure of 1.7%. This was still the slowest growth since the first quarter of the 2013, however. The Office for National Statistics said the underlying picture was of slower and uneven growth across the UK economy. The boost to growth in the fourth quarter came from services and manufacturing, but consumer related sectors showed much slower growth. NF Davos has been tackling an significant issue this morning -- depression. The session was organised with students of the Davos secondary school. William Smith Stubbs a mental health campaigner and co-Founder of Spur:Labs in Australia, told the panel: \u201cMy personal opinion is that no-one gets out of depression alone. We\u2019ve created an artificial culture of \u2018don\u2019t talk about that\u2019. For me it was support of the family - had they not been here then I would not be here, but I didn\u2019t talk about it.\u201d Britain\u2019s economy grew by a better than forecast 0.5%. in the fourth quarter compared to the previous three months. Analysts had been expecting a similar figure to 0.4% growth recorded in the previous quarter, although there was a range from 0.2% to 0.6%. NF Security around Donald Trump\u2019s speech will be ultra-tight today. Journalists have been told that \u201cno water will be allowed\u201d inside the Congress Hall, and there\u2019ll be extra checks on the door too. Anyone who gets that far has already gone through one airport-style security check, but clearly they\u2019re not taking any chances. Back in the UK, the governor of the Bank of England has said Britain\u2019s economy might speed up this year - if we get some Brexit clarity. The UK lagged behind other advanced nations last year, and the IMF predicts this will continue in 2018. But Mark Carney (who is appearing on a Davos panel later today), suggested the UK could catch up with Europe\u2019s growth rate this year. He told Radio 4\u2019s Today Programme: \u201cThe world economy is accelerating, and we haven\u2019t seen that yet. \u201cThere is the prospect this year, as there is greater clarity about the relationship with Europe and subsequently with the rest of the word, for a recoupling \u2013 if I can use that term borrowed from Gwyneth Paltrow - a conscious recoupling of the UK economy with the global economy.\u201d Carney has been pushing to get more women into senior positions at the BoE - maybe the founder of Goop is the answer.... UK journalist Piers Morgan seems to have secured an apology from Donald Trump, for retweeting several anti-Muslim videos last year. There was widespread outrage in the UK last November when Trump shared tweets from the deputy leader of the far-right Britain First group. Pressed on the issue by Morgan, Trump says: \u201cPerhaps it was a big story in Britain , perhaps it was a big story in the UK, but in the United States it wasn\u2019t a big story. If you are telling me they\u2019re horrible people, horrible racist people, I would certainly apologise if you\u2019d like me to do that.\u201d Last night, Trump met with the bosses of some of Europe\u2019s biggest firms - including HSBC, SAP, Bayer and Nestle. The group devoured salads, grilled beef tenderloin and fried Swiss pikeperch washed down with wine and water. According to those in attendance, the group discussed Kanye West\u2019s role in designing Adidas shoes, Volvo\u2019s US-based Mack Trucks division, and Nestl\u00e9\u2019s non-chocolate business portfolio. A certain amount of false modesty may have been on display. At one stage, Trump remarked: \u201cWhen he says he works for Siemens, he\u2019s the president of Siemens!...Wow, that\u2019s big!....Good luck with the G.E. purchase.\u201d Trump also made some surprising comments about the US economy - suggesting it could be matching India\u2019s growth rate (of around 9%). \u201cHow can it be that the US is too big to grow at the same pace?\u201d he pondered. Despite his attacks on the world elite, Donald Trump and his top team have been enjoying their time in Davos. The FT reports that two top Trump advisors sashayed into the Salesforce party (a hot WEF ticket). Gary Cohn, Donald Trump\u2019s chief economic adviser, and HR McMaster, the president\u2019s national security adviser, were among the very small group of Davos merrymakers able to cut the line outside the Cabana nightclub where the Hawaiian-themed party was held. It was par for the course for the Trump team in Davos. Moving and grooving with the global elite that Mr Trump railed against on the campaign trail, the president and his travelling party seemed to be getting their way. \u201cHe was exuberant,\u201d the chairman of a large European bank said of Mr Trump. More here: Team Trump cuts the line at coolest party in Davos Inequality campaigners have brought their message to Davos: Good morning from Davos. It\u2019s the final day of the World Economic Forum, and one man dominates the agenda. President Trump will become the first US president to address Davos in almost 20 years this afternoon. But what will Trump say? He could use the Davos spotlight to attack globalisation and promote his America First economic policies. Alternatively, he could take a conciliatory approach, and try to repair relations with some of the many people he has offended since entering the White House. There\u2019s even talk that some delegates could stage a walkout during his speech. Quartz: Davos attendees are quietly planning to walk out of Trump\u2019s speech Trump may have a lot on his mind; overnight, the New York Times has reported that he ordered the firing of special counsel Robert Mueller last June, but was dissuaded after the White House counsel threatened to resign: Trump isn\u2019t the only item on the menu, though.

Strong domestic momentum will be boosted somewhat by tax cuts, while dollar softness puts the US in a great position to benefit from the global upturn in demand. We also see the growing potential for inflation to hit 3% in the summer as high energy prices, the unwinding of distortions relating to cell phone data plans, rising medical and housing costs and the potential for wage rises add to price pressures.

The environment, food and rural affairs (Efra) committee is pressing Whitehall to implement specific recommendations to improve the wider food standards inspection regime, after a Guardian and ITV undercover investigation prompted 2 Sisters Food Group to temporarily shut its West Bromwich site last October. In a letter to Steve Brine, the parliamentary undersecretary of state for public health, committee chairman Neil Parish wrote: \u201cWe are disappointed with the lack of definite action taken by the FSA [Food Standards Agency] and wider government to date. We trust that the further response we receive by 17 February will be more thorough in setting out the concrete steps the government will be taking.\u201d While Parish welcomed moves to require CCTV monitoring of meat cutting plants, he is still pushing for confirmation that the Treasury will approve funding for the National Food Crime Unit, and that the FSA will \u201creceive all data gathered by retailers and accreditation bodies so that a single, unified picture of standards and hygiene practices in food processing plants can be drawn and failings better identified\u201d. The committee\u2019s inquiry was launched as a direct response to the Guardian and ITV undercover West Bromwich footage that showed chicken being dropped on the floor and returned to the production line, and an instance of labels recording the slaughter dates of poultry being changed. The chicken processor has denied the footage at that factory showed any food safety breaches and said it temporarily suspended production in West Bromwich three days later because of process failures, adding that its \u201cinternal investigation has shown some isolated instances of non-compliance with our own quality management systems\u201d. In December, leaked documents showed how Tesco food standards inspectors had unearthed a series of \u201cmajor\u201d process issues at a second 2 Sisters Food Group factory, on the same weekend that separate concerns prompted the West Bromwich closure. The supermarket\u2019s auditors gave the 2 Sisters chicken plant in Scotland what they described as a \u201cred\u201d warning rating, after identifying process failures that the retailer \u201cinsisted \u2026 were addressed immediately to prevent any food safety issues\u201d. Fewer than 1% of Tesco supplier sites receive a \u201cred\u201d audit rating, the worst score in the supermarket\u2019s internal colour-coded safety and quality compliance system. The supermarket did not pass its full report to the FSA until being contacted by the Guardian and ITV. In December, 2 Sisters Food Group said that the October factory inspection in Scotland did not show \u201cany risk to food safety \u2026 This is using old news to highlight issues which were resolved with our customer two months ago.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump has taken his battle with the media on to the global stage by using a speech in Davos declaring the US open for business to accuse his press and TV critics of being mean, vicious and purveyors of fake news. Some members of the audience of business leaders, politicians, academics and media representatives at the World Economic Forum responded to the president\u2019s renewed onslaught by hissing. Speaking to a packed hall on Friday, Trump boasted of his record since entering the White House and said there had never been a better time for businesses to hire and build in the low tax and low regulation economy he was creating. It came as the latest figures showed the US economy growing at an annual rate of 2.6% in the final three months of 2017, weaker than the 3% growth Wall Street had been expecting. \u201cThe world is witnessing the resurgence of a strong and prosperous America,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m here to deliver a simple message. There has never been a better time to hire, to build, to invest and to grow in the United States. America is open for business and we are competitive once again. \u201cAfter years of stagnation, the United States is once again experiencing strong economic growth. The world is witnessing the resurgence of a strong and prosperous America.\u201d But the speech, which contained a threat of fresh protectionist measures and a warning that other countries should spend more on defence, was greeted less warmly than that of Emmanuel Macron earlier this week. There was derision from the audience when Trump said in a question and answer session that he had not understood how \u201cnasty, how mean, how vicious and how fake the media can be\u201d before entering politics. There was also hissing at the start of Trump\u2019s speech when, in introductory remarks, the WEF founder, Klaus Schwab, said the president\u2019s strong leadership was \u201copen to misconception and biased interpretations\u201d. Fears that Trump would use his speech to announce new protectionist measures proved unfounded and he stuck to a script in which he insisted the US was committed to free and open trade, provided the rules were fair. He also sought international cooperation to \u201c denuke the Korean peninsula\u201d. While wooing big business, Trump made it clear that the address was also intended for a domestic US audience. \u201cOnly by hearing and responding to the voices of the forgotten can we create a bright future that is truly shared by all,\u201d he said. The rich and powerful people at the Swiss mountain resort had the power to transform lives and shape their countries\u2019 destinies, Trump added. \u201cWith this power comes an obligation, however, a duty of loyalty to the people, workers, customers, who made you who you are,\u201d he said. The US president said the stock market had reached record highs on more than 80 separate occasions over the past year and tax cuts that offer most to corporations and the well-off were trickling down to workers. \u201cWe lowered our corporate tax rate from 35% all the way down to 21%. As a result, millions of workers have received tax cut bonuses from their employers in amounts as large as $3,000,\u201d he said. Trump said he had cut 22 \u201cburdensome\u201d regulations for every new rule, saying this was freeing businesses and workers to flourish as never before. \u201cRegulation is stealth taxation,\u201d he said, attacking unelected bureaucrats for imposing anti-business and anti-worker rules. \u201cIn America, those days are over.\u201d Earlier this week, Washington announced that it was imposing tariffs on Chinese solar panels and washing machines, and Trump insisted the US would no longer \u201cturn a blind eye to unfair economic practices including massive intellectual property theft, industrial subsidies, and pervasive, state-led economic planning\u201d. \u201cWe are also making historic investments in the American military, because we cannot have prosperity without security. To make the world safer from rogue regimes, terrorism and revisionist powers, we\u2019re asking our friends and allies to invest in their own defences and to meet their financial obligations. Our common security requires everyone to contribute their fair share,\u201d he said. Winnie Byanyima, the executive director of Oxfam International, said the speech amounted to a \u201cbillionaires-first\u201d policy. \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s boastful sales pitch was a victory lap for the trillions of tax cuts that the wealthy elites and corporations have clamoured for. The evidence is clear: these tax cuts are looting the US treasury to enrich the 1%,\u201d she said. Phillip Jennings, the general secretary of the UNI global trade union, said: \u201cTrump seems to think that America is all right if the stock market is all right.\u201d Marc Benioff, the founder and chief executive of Salesforce, a US cloud computing company, said: \u201cI thought it was a great speech. I thought his economic narrative has become greatly enhanced now that the tax cuts have passed.\u201d",

There has never been a better time to hire, to build, to invest and to grow in the United States. America is open for business and we are competitive once again.</p> \n<p>\u201cAfter years of stagnation, the United States is once again experiencing strong economic growth. The world is witnessing the resurgence of a strong and prosperous America.\u201d</p> \n<p>But the speech, which contained a <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2018/01/26/full-text-trump-davos-speech-transcript-370861\">threat of fresh protectionist measures</a> and a warning that other countries should spend more on defence, was greeted less warmly than that of Emmanuel Macron earlier this week.</p> \n<p>There was derision from the audience when Trump said in a question and answer session that he had not understood how \u201cnasty, how mean, how vicious and how fake the media can be\u201d before entering politics.</p> \n<p>There was also hissing at the start of Trump\u2019s speech when, in introductory remarks, the WEF founder, Klaus Schwab, said the president\u2019s strong leadership was \u201copen to misconception and biased interpretations\u201d.</p> \n<p>Fears that Trump would use his speech to announce new protectionist measures proved unfounded and he stuck to a script in which he insisted the US was committed to free and open trade, provided the rules were fair. He also sought international cooperation to \u201c denuke the Korean peninsula\u201d.<br></p> \n<p>While wooing big business, Trump made it clear that the address was also intended for a domestic US audience. \u201cOnly by hearing and responding to the voices of the forgotten can we create a bright future that is truly shared by all,\u201d he said.<br></p> \n<p>The rich and powerful people at the Swiss mountain resort had the power to transform lives and shape their countries\u2019 destinies, Trump added. \u201cWith this power comes an obligation, however, a duty of loyalty to the people, workers, customers, who made you who you are,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>The US president said the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/16/dow-jones-tops-26000-for-first-time-as-stock-market-boom-continues\">stock market had reached record highs </a>on more than 80 separate occasions over the past year and tax cuts that offer most to corporations and the well-off were trickling down to workers.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe lowered our corporate tax rate from 35% all the way down to 21%. As a result, millions of workers have received tax cut bonuses from their employers in amounts as large as $3,000,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Trump said he had cut 22 \u201cburdensome\u201d regulations for every new rule, saying this was freeing businesses and workers to flourish as never before. \u201cRegulation is stealth taxation,\u201d he said, attacking unelected bureaucrats for imposing anti-business and anti-worker rules. \u201cIn America, those days are over.\u201d </p> \n<p>Earlier this week, Washington announced that it was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jan/23/trump-imposes-steep-tariffs-on-imported-solar-panels-and-washing-machines\">imposing tariffs on Chinese solar panels</a> and washing machines, and Trump insisted the US would no longer \u201cturn a blind eye to unfair economic practices including massive intellectual property theft, industrial subsidies, and pervasive, state-led economic planning\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe are also making historic investments in the American military, because we cannot have prosperity without security. To make the world safer from rogue regimes, terrorism and revisionist powers, we\u2019re asking our friends and allies to invest in their own defences and to meet their financial obligations. Our common security requires everyone to contribute their fair share,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Winnie Byanyima, the executive director of Oxfam International, said the speech amounted to a \u201cbillionaires-first\u201d policy.</p> \n<p>\u201cPresident Trump\u2019s boastful sales pitch was a victory lap for the trillions of tax cuts that the wealthy elites and corporations have clamoured for. The evidence is clear: these tax cuts are looting the US treasury to enrich the 1%,\u201d she said.<br></p> \n<p>Phillip Jennings, the general secretary of the UNI global trade union, said: \u201cTrump seems to think that America is all right if the stock market is all right.\u201d</p> \n<p>Marc Benioff, the founder and chief executive of Salesforce, a US cloud computing company, said: \u201cI thought it was a great speech. I thought his economic narrative has become greatly enhanced now that the tax cuts have passed.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Guardian business email sign-up\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\n </figcaption> \n</figure>",

      "bodyText": "More than half of the 1,900 ultra-luxury apartments built in London last year failed to sell, raising fears that the capital will be left with dozens of \u201cposh ghost towers\u201d. The swanky flats, complete with private gyms, swimming pools and cinema rooms, are lying empty as hundreds of thousands of would-be first-time buyers struggle to find an affordable home. The total number of unsold luxury new-build homes, which are rarely advertised at less than \u00a31m, has now hit a record high of 3,000 units, as the rich overseas investors they were built for turn their backs on the UK due to Brexit uncertainty and the hike in stamp duty on second homes. Builders started work last year on 1,900 apartments priced at more than \u00a31,500 per sq ft, but only 900 have sold, according to property data experts Molior London. A typical high-end three-bedroom apartment consists of around 2,000 sq ft, which works out at a sale price of \u00a33m. There are an extra 14,000 unsold apartments on the market for between \u00a31,000-\u00a31,500 per sq ft. The average price per sq ft across the UK is \u00a3211. Molior says it would take at least three years to sell the glut of ultra-luxury flats if sales continue at their current rate and if no further new-builds are started. However, ambitious property developers have a further 420 residential towers (each at least 20 storeys high) in the pipeline, says New London Architecture and GL Hearn. Henry Pryor, a property buying agent, says the London luxury new-build market is \u201calready overstuffed but we\u2019re just building more of them\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have loads of empty and part-built posh ghost towers,\u201d he says. \u201cThey were built as gambling chips for rich overseas investors, but they are no longer interested in the London casino and have moved on.\u201d Pryor says developers of luxury blocks lining the Thames have failed to sell homes despite offering discounts, incentives and freebies \u2013 including free furniture, carpets and curtains and even cars. He adds that new-build towers are proving hard to sell because while they offer luxuries including concierge, gyms and spas, \u201cthey\u2019re all the same\u201d. Some developers have delayed construction of projects, while others have taken properties off the market. All 10 of the apartments at the top of the Shard \u2013 priced at up to \u00a350m each \u2013 remain unsold more than five years after the Duke of York and the former prime minister of Qatar officially opened \u201cEurope\u2019s first vertical city\u201d. Steven Herd, founder and chief executive of MyLondonHome, an agency that specialises in new-build homes for investment, says his firm is struggling under the weight of overseas investors who bought in the last couple of years and are desperate to sell. He says hundreds of Asian investors who had bought London developments off-plan in 2015-16 in the hope of making a quick profit by selling apartments on closer to completion have instead lost hundreds of thousands of pounds. \u201cThey intended to flip [buy and sell on] the apartments and make big profits, but it hasn\u2019t worked out like that, and now they are trying to get out at the smallest possible loss.\u201d He adds that in one case a Russian investor bought an off-plan property in 2014 for \u00a33.1m, but couldn\u2019t afford to complete and sold it for \u00a32.55m. Herd says the Nine Elms development, near the new US embassy in south London, was one of the best redevelopment schemes in Europe but consisted of \u201cthe wrong properties that Londoners don\u2019t need\u201d. \u201cWe need \u2018affordable\u2019 one- or two-bedroom apartments priced at \u00a3500,000. We don\u2019t need swimming pools and empty rooftop bars with no one living at home to buy drinks at them. There\u2019s just way too many \u00a31.5m-\u00a32m-\u00a33m flats that all look the same. \u201cWe\u2019d be much better off with decent quality but lower-spec homes built for actual Londoners. What\u2019s the point in having private cinema rooms that sit empty and resident\u2019s swimming pools with no one swimming in them; it just seems wrong.\u201d In its report, based on interviews with 684 developers across London, Molior says sales of new homes in London fell by a fifth over the last three months of 2017 compared with the previous quarter. \u201cNew starts on site also fell by a fifth, but starts still out-paced sales \u2026 so the number of unsold units continues to grow.\u201d The report says many developers face a \u201cgloomy picture of falling sales\u201d and are \u201cperhaps starting to become uncomfortable with the emerging situation\u201d. Molior says some inexperienced developers who hoped to cash-in on demand from overseas investors now find themselves \u201coff-pitch in terms of the location/quality/price equation\u201d. \u201cExperienced players are increasingly rumoured to be resorting to \u2018Plan-B\u2019, while the fate of newcomers may depend on whether they can afford to sit-it-out or rent-it-out,\u201d Molior says. The consultancy adds that \u201cplan B\u201d would typically involve a \u201cbulk sale\u201d. Hoping for great profits, developers have continued to build expensive towers, while the greatest demand from Londoners is for more affordable homes. Estate agent Savills estimates that 58% of demand in London is for homes priced below \u00a3450 psf, but only 25% of homes being built are at this price. Marcus Dixon, head of research at property data service LonRes, says the very peak of the London prime property market was still selling well but it was proving difficult to sell expensive and well-appointed apartments in big towers. \u201cLots of schemes started two to three years ago and are now coming to market,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s the big towers with lots and lots of units in them [that are proving hard to sell]. Those in Nine Elms [near Battersea power station] and Earls Court which in the less distant past would have been sold off-plan to overseas investors. But the buyers, for various reasons including Brexit, just aren\u2019t there any more for those sort of properties. \u201cThe volumes that are coming out of the ground in Nine Elms are huge, and it\u2019s a lot of flats that are all quite similar in terms of spec and price.\u201d Dixon says he expected developers to \u201cgo slow\u201d or halt the later stages of developments until they have managed to sell more of the stock they\u2019ve already built. But he adds that slowing production of flats was a lot harder than building traditional houses. \u201cIf you\u2019re building an estate of 100 houses in the countryside, you can stop building when they\u2019re not selling,\u201d he says. \u201cBut if you\u2019re building a big tower you can\u2019t have anyone living in them until the whole tower is completed.\u201d He adds that that if a homeowner can\u2019t sell their home at the price they\u2019re aiming for they can withdraw it from the market but \u201cfor developer\u2019s that\u2019s not a solution \u2013 developers in some ways are forced sellers\u201d. Dixon says developers are switching their marketing efforts from overseas to local owner occupiers, \u201cbut they compare the price of new-builds to the secondhand market and find that there\u2019s a high premium on new-build towers\u201d.",

Since then, it has been charged like income tax \u2013 you pay a higher rate only on the part of your purchase that falls over each threshold.

The pub chain said it had ended the deal after inspections of Russell Hume\u2019s Birmingham site revealed the business was \u201cunable to demonstrate compliance with food hygiene rules at its locations\u201d. The chairman of JD Wetherspoon, Tim Martin, apologised to customers after it was forced to remove meat from its menu on Tuesday, leaving customers without rump, sirloin or gammon at the chain\u2019s weekly steak night. Martin said: \u201cOur decision to stop serving steak from Tuesday 23 January, despite limited information from the supplier, was the correct one. Steak is one of the most popular dishes on our menu, and we serve around 200,000 per week on average, about half of these on our extremely popular Tuesday night steak club.\u201d The company is sourcing products from different suppliers and has confirmed steaks will be back on the menu from next Tuesday. Hilton Hotels, which was also supplied with meat by Russell Hume, has also taken meat products from the company off its menu. A spokesperson for Hilton said: \u201cWe can confirm that a small number of Hilton hotels in the UK were supplied by Russell Hume and, following advice from the FSA, the hotels acted immediately to dispose of all products supplied by the company. The safety and security of guests is our primary concernand we uphold stringent food safety standards in all of our hotels.\u201d Jamie\u2019s Italian stripped Russell Hume products from its menus and changed suppliers this week.

Russell Hume, which is based in Derby and has various sites around the country, had an unannounced visit from Food Standards Agency inspectors on 12 January. The FSA said the company had \u201cserious non-compliance with food hygiene regulations\u201d. The watchdog said it had suspended distribution of all Russell Hume meat products until bosses could assure the agency it was \u201ccomplying with the relevant legislation, and that they are producing safe food\u201d. The FSA has said there was no indication that anyone had become ill from eating Russell Hume meat.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The UK shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, has used his debut appearance at the World Economic Forum to warn leaders of global businesses that they are held in contempt by ordinary voters who have struggled through a decade of austerity. Interviewed by the Guardian in Davos, McDonnell said he found the euphoria in Davos about the modest pick-up in world growth shocking, adding that those running big corporations were guilty of complacency. \u201cYou get the feeling that they are cut off in their compound from what people on the outside are feeling,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is an ecstatic reaction to a turn in the economic cycle that was inevitable. They don\u2019t understand the deep alienation.\u201d McDonnell\u2019s criticisms of business, and his policies such as higher corporate taxes and renationalisation, mean that, as with Donald Trump, his decision to attend raised a few eyebrows. The shadow chancellor said he came in order to tell a few home truths on the \u201cavalanche of discontent and resentment out there\u201d. \u201cWhy did I come? Firstly, I got an invitation and I thought this was the time to check just what the discussions were, what the assessments being made by individuals were and what the feelings were about the future. Secondly, to deliver a message that people need to look at things like the result of Brexit and address the issues that caused it,\u201d he said. \u201cDavos is what I expected. It embodies the criticisms I have made of it in the past. I don\u2019t think the people here have any comprehension of the contempt in which they are held.\u201d McDonnell said the corporations represented at Davos had been getting away with \u201cindustrial-scale tax avoidance\u201d while ordinary people struggled. \u201cThey just don\u2019t get it. It\u2019s the system and it needs to be changed,\u201d he said. He said the big auditing companies should have the equivalent of a doctor\u2019s Hippocratic oath so that they did not encourage firms to avoid tax. \u201cTen years after the crash, after 10 years of austerity and 10 years of paying their taxes and seeing public services cut, people have had enough.\u201d The shadow chancellor believes the pick-up in economic growth has allowed discontent to surface. \u201cIn the depths of the recession people concentrated on survival,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen the cycle turns and people are told the sunny uplands are before them, that\u2019s when people get alienated, angry.\u201d McDonnell called for an international pledge among progressive governments to introduce a financial transaction tax (FTT) to begin to address the inequalities of the global system and restructure the global economy. Labour put an FTT in its 2017 manifesto and has committed to spend 50% of the proceeds on aid. \u201cOther countries should follow our lead,\u201d McDonnell said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to wait for a global agreement. We don\u2019t have to wait for a complicated structure. We can protect public services and provide money for development.\u201d Asked what his message was to Davos, McDonnell said: \u201cPay your workers a living wage. Make sure workers are properly represented and have a say, a share in the profits and a share in the ownership. Individual company directors here in Davos have the chance to take a lead.\u201d McDonnell expressed enthusiasm for a basic income, an idea much debated in Davos in the light of the disruption to labour markets expected from the growth of artificial intelligence. The shadow chancellor said: \u201cThere are technological developments that will change the nature of work. The question is whether the developments are used for the intensification of exploitation or whether the benefits are shared with workers.\u201d UK business leaders in Davos have privately been expressing concern about Labour\u2019s plans to renationalise the railways, the Royal Mail and the utility companies. McDonnell says he is not surprised that there is opposition, and dismissed a report from a rightwing thinktank that the plan would cost \u00a3176bn. \u201cOf course they are having a go, because we are serious about it and it has popular support,\u201d he said. \u201cDetailed work is going on apace.\u201d",

McDonnell says he is not surprised that there is opposition, and dismissed <a href=\"https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?tab=mm#search/CPS/161179fbe4b78eec\">a report from a rightwing thinktank</a> that the plan would cost \u00a3176bn.</p> <p>\u201cOf course they are having a go, because we are serious about it and it has popular support,\u201d he said. \u201cDetailed work is going on apace.\u201d<br></p>",

      "bodyText": "The British economy grew at a faster rate than expected in the final three months of 2017, despite pockets of weaker and more uneven growth triggered by the Brexit vote. GDP grew by 0.5% in the fourth quarter after expansion of 0.4% in the previous three months, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). City economists had forecast growth of 0.4%. However, officials said the rate of expansion for the year as a whole was the slowest since 2012, having fallen from 1.9% in 2016 to 1.8%. The ONS also said the bigger picture showed weaker and more uneven expansion. Darren Morgan of the ONS said the boost to the economy came from recruitment agencies, letting agents and office management, adding that there was slow and unsteady growth elsewhere, particularly in consumer-facing sectors. The UK has suffered over the past year as rising inflation prompted by the slide in the value of the pound after the EU referendum outstrips weak wage growth, denting the spending power of consumers. \u201cDespite a slight uptick in the latest quarter, the underlying picture is of slower and uneven growth across the economy,\u201d he said. Hotels, caterers and transport and distribution firms recorded weaker growth owing to constraints on consumer spending, the ONS said. There was also weaker growth across the car industry and for cinemas. Peter Dowd, the shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said the latest GDP figures showed \u201ccontinued Tory austerity\u201d was undermining the UK economy at a time of falling real wages and rising household debt. \u201cWe need an urgent change of direction,\u201d the Labour MP said. Despite the pockets of weakness, the acceleration in the fourth quarter reflected solid expansion of 0.6% in the country\u2019s dominant services sector. Manufacturing also had an upbeat three months, rising by 1.3% on the back of a strengthening global and Eurozone economy, which has bolstered UK exports. The pound extended recent gains made over the past few weeks against the dollar on foreign exchanges to hit almost $1.43, amid speculation that the stronger-than expected reading on the economy may encourage the Bank of England to further raise interest rates after its first rate rise in a decade last year. The figures come after the employment rate, which measures the proportion of 16- to 64-year-olds in work, hit its joint highest level since comparable records began in 1971. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, said both pieces of economic news were \u201cachievements to be proud of\u201d. Britain\u2019s economy has proven more resilient than forecast before the EU referendum 18 months ago, helped by improving economic conditions around the world. The fall in the pound after the Brexit vote also helped to strengthen exports. Economists have said the UK could have performed better still without the vote to leave the EU, having trailed the US, France and Germany, where growth has surged ahead in recent months. The International Monetary Fund forecasts a growth rate of 1.5% for the UK this year, compared with 2.7% for the US and 2.2% for the eurozone. Britain could have grown almost one percentage point faster at about 2.5% last year without Brexit, according to Kallum Pickering at the City bank Berenberg. Jeremy Cook, chief economist at payments transfer firm World First, said: \u201cThe UK economy is in a chronic crawl at the moment whilst the rest of the world is enjoying a significant skip higher in growth.\u201d The Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, said the UK should however begin to \u201crecouple\u201d with the world economy later this year, should the UK gain greater clarity over its future trading relationship with Europe in the Brexit negotiations. Speaking from Switzerland on the BBC Radio 4 Today programme, Carney said Britain then begin to \u201crecouple\u201d with the upswing in growth being enjoyed by the world economy towards the end of this year . \u201cIf I can use that term borrowed from Gwyneth Paltrow \u2013 [there is the prospect of] a conscious recoupling of the UK economy with the global economy,\u201d he added.",
