      "bodyText": "British businesses are on a marketing blitz, with an influential industry report revealing the biggest surge in spending since records began 14 years ago. In a sign that confidence about the economic recovery is taking hold, marketers increased their advertising, sponsorship, public relations and other promotional budgets for the sixth quarter in a row, according to the Bellwether report. The first three months of the year showed the sharpest upturn since the Institute of Practitioners in Advertising (IPA) began collecting Bellwether data, with a net balance of 20% of companies registering an increase, up sharply from the final quarter of 2013, when the increase was 11%. The survey measures the strength of the media market by subtracting the percentage of marketers reporting a decrease from those reporting an increase. During the full financial year to April, a net 17% of marketing executives reported an increase, marking the first net positive year since 2006-07. \"This is a very good place to be,\" said the IPA's director general, Paul Bainsfair. \"All very good news for the government in the run-up to an election year.\" Optimism looks likely to grow this financial year, with data suggesting that 26% of companies expect to see growth, the best recorded for seven years. Traditional media such as television, newspapers and magazines have benefited most, reversing recent trends by performing better than internet advertising in the first three months of the year, indicating a growing willingness among marketers to commit to high-profile campaigns. Google, whose business model has wreaked havoc in the media industry, has emerged as one of the UK's biggest advertisers, raising its spending by 50% last year to \u00a345m, ahead of Mars and telecoms firm O2. In the Bellwether report estimates for advertising on TV, newspapers and magazines were revised upwards by 12% of companies, internet by 8.5%, and spending on events by 6% of companies. \"The spring Bellwether report reveals the most upbeat assessment of business and marketing spend we have seen since starting the survey in 2000,\" said an economist and Bellwether author, Chris Williamson. \"Last year saw the biggest rise in marketing spend since 2006, and 2014 looks set to be even better. \"Companies are ramping up their markets and advertising expenditure in the face of growing optimism about the economic outlook. As higher marketing spend is also usually accompanied by rising business investment and job creation, this augurs well for economic growth to top 3% this year.\"",

And therein lies one of his biggest problems. Clarke is now the only full-time, executive director of a business with 530,000 staff operating in 12 countries. And, as yesterday's annual results showed, he has far more problems than one man could hope to handle. Group profits are down for the second year in a row. The UK business \u2013 which hauls in 65% of total profits \u2013 is down for the third consecutive year. There have been some improvements in the performance of the international operations, but key countries such as Ireland and Thailand have lurched further into the doldrums. Tesco yesterday took a loss of \u00a3540m on the Chinese business it once had such lofty ambitions for. There was also an \u00a3800m hit on Europe, where profits were down 28%. In the UK, the chain is being battered by the discounters. Tesco's share of the UK grocery market is at a 10-year low (pretty much the same as the share price). Like-for-like sales in the most recent weeks are down 3% \u2013 the worst decline in a generation. Clarke has a plan to turn that around, comprised largely of sharper prices and revamped stores. Yesterday he boasted that sales in the stores refurbished so far were up 3%-5%. But that is hardly hitting the ball out of the park. Clarke has a massive job on his hands to turn Tesco around and needs more boardroom strength. His predecessor, Terry Leahy, had a board of seven executive directors, but one by one they have either quit or been shown the checkout. The latest to announce his departure is finance director Laurie McIlwee, and there is no replacement in sight, even though rumours of his departure had been circulating for months. Making matters worse, some of Clarke's ex-colleagues are now, behind hands, talking out of school to question his credentials. Investors will soon be demanding to know how Tesco's non-executive directors, especially the group's invisible chairman, Sir Richard Broadbent, have allowed the Tesco boardroom to become so stripped of talent.",

      "standfirst": "Tax campaigners question benefits of move from Netherlands where firm's office is little more than 'conduit or moneybox'", 
      "body": "<p>Tax campaigners have questioned whether Starbucks will make a significant additional contribution to Treasury coffers after the coffee chain announced that it is moving its European head office from the Netherlands to the UK.</p> <p>Accountant and campaigner Richard Murphy said the coffee chain's small head office operation, currently in Amsterdam, was little more than a \"conduit or moneybox\" used by Starbucks to collect royalty payments and move them on to other parts of the group. \"There has never been an intention to make serious profits in the Netherlands and I am sure there won't be in the UK.\"</p> <p>Starbucks' European head office was at the centre of criticisms 18 months ago that it had been depressing the group's tax bills around Europe by charging sister companies heavy royalty fees. Moving these headquarter operations to London is the latest example of a wave of multinationals arriving in Britain after a series of controversial tax reforms pushed through by George Osborne to woo international firms.</p> <p>The relocation will have no impact on the tax position of the group's coffee chain business in the UK. This operating business was heavily criticised by MPs and tax campaigners in 2012 after it emerged that the business had paid just \u00a38.3m in tax since coming to the UK in 1998, despite sales of more than \u00a33bn.</p> <p>On Wednesday Starbucks claimed that the head office move would \"mean we pay more tax in the UK\", but the amount is expected to be negligible based on an analysis of head office operations in Amsterdam. Accounts filed in the Netherlands show the existing head office operation has been loss-making since 2010, and paid just \u20ac342,000 (\u00a3281,500) in tax last year.</p> <p>Despite amassing revenues of \u20ac92.5m for the year to September 2013, mainly in Starbucks royalty fees from regional coffee shop chains across Europe and the Middle East, Starbucks' European head office made a pretax loss of \u20ac3.9m.</p> <p>This was after heavy deductions, including \u20ac27.8m of salary costs, primarily for executives; and a \u20ac52m payment to sister entities within the Starbucks group related to yet more royalty agreements.</p> <p>Not all deductions at Starbucks' European HQ were allowable for corporation tax, so it did pay a small amount of tax. Any new UK tax liability arising from the shifting of the European headquarters is expected to be similarly modest.</p> <p>Faced with a consumer boycott, <a href=\"http://www.starbucks.co.uk/blog/an-open-letter-from-kris-engskov/1249\" title=\"\">Starbucks responded</a> with \"a commitment \u2026 to pay a significant amount of corporation tax during 2013 and 2014, regardless of whether our company is profitable\".</p> <p>In truth, Starbucks did not make voluntary tax overpayments, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/jun/24/starbucks-uk-tax-hmrc-accounts?CMP=twt_gu\" title=\"\">as many had understood this promise to mean</a>. Instead, Starbucks agreed to temporarily unwind aggressive intra-group transactions \u2013 including royalty payments \u2013 which had depressed UK taxable profits. This moratorium will expire in September.</p> <p>The shift to the UK is expected to involve only a handful of senior executives transferring to offices in London. Starbucks said that the move would help its executives oversee the company's largest European operation, in the UK.</p> <p>The group's London-based European boss Kris Engskov, who had been about to move to the Netherlands, has cancelled these plans and will remain in the UK.</p> <p>Engskov was previously a close adviser to Bill Clinton as US president and worked on his 1992 election campaign. During the campaign the Clinton camp attacked George Bush Sr, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/21/starbucks-tax-ps-wake-up-smell-coffee#start-of-comments\" title=\"\">accusing him of being soft of taxing big business</a>.

      "bodyText": "Tax campaigners have questioned whether Starbucks will make a significant additional contribution to Treasury coffers after the coffee chain announced that it is moving its European head office from the Netherlands to the UK. Accountant and campaigner Richard Murphy said the coffee chain's small head office operation, currently in Amsterdam, was little more than a \"conduit or moneybox\" used by Starbucks to collect royalty payments and move them on to other parts of the group. \"There has never been an intention to make serious profits in the Netherlands and I am sure there won't be in the UK.\" Starbucks' European head office was at the centre of criticisms 18 months ago that it had been depressing the group's tax bills around Europe by charging sister companies heavy royalty fees. Moving these headquarter operations to London is the latest example of a wave of multinationals arriving in Britain after a series of controversial tax reforms pushed through by George Osborne to woo international firms. The relocation will have no impact on the tax position of the group's coffee chain business in the UK. This operating business was heavily criticised by MPs and tax campaigners in 2012 after it emerged that the business had paid just \u00a38.3m in tax since coming to the UK in 1998, despite sales of more than \u00a33bn. On Wednesday Starbucks claimed that the head office move would \"mean we pay more tax in the UK\", but the amount is expected to be negligible based on an analysis of head office operations in Amsterdam. Accounts filed in the Netherlands show the existing head office operation has been loss-making since 2010, and paid just \u20ac342,000 (\u00a3281,500) in tax last year. Despite amassing revenues of \u20ac92.5m for the year to September 2013, mainly in Starbucks royalty fees from regional coffee shop chains across Europe and the Middle East, Starbucks' European head office made a pretax loss of \u20ac3.9m. This was after heavy deductions, including \u20ac27.8m of salary costs, primarily for executives; and a \u20ac52m payment to sister entities within the Starbucks group related to yet more royalty agreements. Not all deductions at Starbucks' European HQ were allowable for corporation tax, so it did pay a small amount of tax. Any new UK tax liability arising from the shifting of the European headquarters is expected to be similarly modest. Faced with a consumer boycott, Starbucks responded with \"a commitment \u2026 to pay a significant amount of corporation tax during 2013 and 2014, regardless of whether our company is profitable\". In truth, Starbucks did not make voluntary tax overpayments, as many had understood this promise to mean. Instead, Starbucks agreed to temporarily unwind aggressive intra-group transactions \u2013 including royalty payments \u2013 which had depressed UK taxable profits. This moratorium will expire in September. The shift to the UK is expected to involve only a handful of senior executives transferring to offices in London. Starbucks said that the move would help its executives oversee the company's largest European operation, in the UK. The group's London-based European boss Kris Engskov, who had been about to move to the Netherlands, has cancelled these plans and will remain in the UK. Engskov was previously a close adviser to Bill Clinton as US president and worked on his 1992 election campaign. During the campaign the Clinton camp attacked George Bush Sr, accusing him of being soft of taxing big business. They told voters, if elected, they could collect an additional $45bn in tax by clamping down on foreign multinationals that were aggressively shifting taxable profits out of the US. The move is not expected to impact Starbucks' operational hub for Europe and the Middle East, which will continue to operate out of Amsterdam and employ more than 200 staff. This business, which supplies coffee to Starbucks coffee chains has also been the target of criticisms for the prices charged to sister companies. Critics say these prices do not reflect a market price and are designed to shift profits to more favourable tax jurisdictions \u2014 allegations Starbucks has always denied. The G20 group of countries last year ordered an overhaul of the tax treaty guidelines that govern how multinational companies transact with themselves across national borders in the wake of a series of controversies involving Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple as well as Starbucks. At the World Economic Forum in Davos last year, David Cameron appeared give his backing to public outrage at Starbucks' aggressive tax treatments in the UK. He told an audience of business leaders: \"Some forms of avoidance have become so aggressive that I think it is right to say these are ethical issues and it is time to call for more responsibility and for government's to act accordingly.\" In a thinly veiled jibe, he urged multinationals to \"wake up and smell the coffee\". Behind the rhetoric, however, other G20 nations, including Germany and the US, have been growing increasingly frustrated at unilateral tax reforms pushed through by Britain which have been attracting large numbers of multinational companies to relocate their headquarters in London.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Wage growth has finally started to outpace inflation after years of falling real earnings, and unemployment has fallen to its lowest level in five years, figures released on Wednesday show. In a boost to British households, pay including bonuses rose by 1.7% over the three months to February, just ahead of the March inflation rate of 1.6%, published by the ONS on Tuesday. The improvement was driven by pay rises in the private sector, where wages were 2% higher than in the same quarter of 2012-13 \u2013 but that was more than double the 0.9% growth for those working in the public sector. For those not getting a bonus, regular pay was up 1.4% over the three months compared with a year earlier, again dragged down by slower public sector earnings growth. The trend marks a milestone for the economy, as wages have not consistently outpaced inflation since 2008. A brief period of rising real wages in 2010 was followed by climbing inflation. Andrew Goodwin, senior economic adviser to the forecasters the EY Item Club, said it was \u201cthe beginning of the end of the cost-of-living crisis\u201d. He added: \u201cAs the recovery firms up, the labour market tightens and skills shortages start to appear we should see wage growth gradually accelerate and establish a clear gap over inflation. \u201cThat said, the decline in real wages has been so severe that it will probably take another four years until we recover from the losses of the past six years.\u201d But Frances O\u2019Grady, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, said: \u201cWith wages increasing by just 1.7%, barely enough to keep up with a prices measure that doesn\u2019t even include housing costs, the cost-of-living crisis is far from solved. This is not worth even half a cheer. The time to celebrate recovery will be when ordinary workers return to pre-crash living standards and the economy is generating more secure skilled jobs with good prospects and decent pay.\u201d The unemployment rate fell more sharply than expected, to 6.9%, over the three months to February, from 7.1% in the three months to November. It was the lowest rate of unemployment since January 2009, but still above pre-crisis levels. Andrew Sentance, PricewaterhouseCoopers economist and a former interest rate setter on the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee (MPC), said the rapid fall in unemployment was a sign that a rise in UK rates was \u201clong overdue\u201d. Interest rates have been on hold at a record low of 0.5% since March 2009. \u201cLow UK inflation is not a reason for postponing rate rises,\u201d Sentance said. \u201cLow inflation allows the MPC to raise rates gradually, which is the best exit policy.\u201d The MPC, led by the Bank\u2019s governor, Mark Carney, has suggested that it will not raise rates until spring 2015. The chancellor, George Osborne, welcomed the jobs data. \u201cComing alongside yesterday\u2019s lower inflation, they are compelling evidence that our economic plan is working. There are now a record number of jobs in Britain \u2013 and today we have taken a further step in meeting the ambition I have set for full employment. Every job created means another family with greater economic security and the prospect of a brighter future. \u201cThese remain difficult times for families facing pressures on their budgets, and much work needs still to be done to build a resilient economy. But today\u2019s news supports the argument we have made all along that the only way to see rising living standards is to grow the economy.\u201d Rachel Reeves, shadow work and pensions secretary, hit back: \u201cIt\u2019s deeply complacent and out of touch for the Tories to try and claim this deep-seated cost-of-living crisis has suddenly been solved. Only Labour has a clear plan to earn our way to higher living standards for all, not just a few at the top.\u201d There are now 2.24 million people out of work in the UK, a quarterly fall of 77,000 in the three months to February. Employment jumped by 239,000 to 30.39 million, helped by the continued rise of self-employment. Joe Grice, chief economist at the ONS, said: \u201cThese figures - rising employment and falling unemployment and inactivity \u2013 continue the strong trend in the labour market that has been seen in recent months. Self-employment has again been a prominent growth area.\u201d The number of people claiming unemployment benefits also fell slightly more than expected, by 30,400 to 1.142 million in March, the lowest level since November 2008. The unemployment rate among 16 to 24-year-olds fell to 19.1% from 20% in the previous quarter. The better data on standards of living is starting to feed through to household optimism according to Markit\u2019s household finance survey for April. The headline measure, which covers overall perceptions of financial wellbeing, reached the highest level in more than five years of data collection. Jack Kennedy, senior economist at Markit, said: \u201cA long-awaited return to rising real wages is likely to boost consumer spending as we move through 2014, adding another piece to the jigsaw of the UK\u2019s economic recovery.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "On a sliding scale of difficulty, writing a general-interest book about high-frequency trading is slightly harder than making baseball statistics interesting, but easier than animating the role played by quantitative analysis in the 2007 financial collapse. \"Collateralised debt obligations,\" says Michael Lewis, who has written about all three, \"are impossible to describe. There's nothing harder. However, trying to show a reader how a market moves? How stock prices move? You can already see them tuning out.\" That was the concern when he wrote Flash Boys, an investigation into what he calls the \"rigged\" underbelly of Wall Street trading. In the event, the book has sold a staggering 130,000 copies in the US in its first week of publication. (By comparison, The Big Short, his biggest seller to date, sold 60,000 in its first week.) Lewis has been on every talk show and financial news panel in the land, arguing with, among others, Bill O'Brien, the president of the Bats Global Markets stock exchange, about whether or not he and his cohorts are ripping off their customers. If the 53-year-old started off angry, opposition to the book has sharpened his stance into a moral crusade. \"I find this story really upsetting,\" he says over lunch in LA, where his publicity tour just ended. \"The idea that the smartest, richest elites of society find this an acceptable activity. This predatory activity.\" If it's emotional for Lewis, then the responses have been emotional too, given how unequivocal his accusations are. The cornerstone of Flash Boys is a discovery made by an obscure Canadian banker, Brad Katsuyama, who noticed that whenever he tried to execute a trade, the stock price moved before the order went through. A long and tortured investigation revealed that the variable speeds at which trading information travels down fibre-optic cables to the exchanges was being exploited by brokers and high-frequency traders \u2013 so-called for the volume of trades they make \u2013 to jump the queue, buy the stocks in question and sell them back at a higher price to the person who expressed the original interest. \"Someone out there was using the fact that stock market orders arrived at different times at different exchanges to front-run [orders],\" writes Lewis. It was a side-effect of automated trading and a tough thing for bankers to wrap their heads around, let alone laypeople. In plain English, as a colleague of Katsuyama's put it: \"My role was to walk around and say to clients, 'Don't you understand you're being fucked?'\" Lewis looks and sounds a lot like the people he is writing about. He is slick, well manicured and fluent in the language of finance \u2013 about as far from the Occupy movement as you can get, and much more dangerous to Wall Street, given that he actually knows what he is talking about. Since the book came out, the FBI, the US department of justice and the New York attorney general's office have all launched investigations into high-frequency trading practices, and Goldman Sachs has discussed the possibility of shutting down its \"dark pool\" \u2013 the anonymous trading venue that, argues Lewis, gives high-frequency traders their unfair advantage. \"I thought it would create a shitstorm,\" he says. \"Then I thought, it's too complicated and I've got a nice Canadian guy as my main character \u2013 I'm not sure how much of a shitstorm this is going to create, because I don't know if even my mother is going to pick it up. But the noise level has been so great.\" Not all of it has been positive. Prominent in reviews of the book has been the critique that Lewis has created a false set of heroes and \u2013 particularly from financial journalists \u2013 that none of this stuff is new in the first place. \"And that's a ton of horseshit, because I've watched Katsuyama educate the world. It's his story. His knowledge starts in '08. And if you knew this already, why didn't you do something about it?\" Lewis has also been accused of wringing fake drama from a story wherein the victims, when it comes down to it, are billionaire hedge fund managers, not the so-called little guys. \"Little people \u2013 their money is largely managed by big institutions: mutual funds, pension funds, endowments, insurance companies \u2013 that's where their money is. It's true that this is a weird place where the interests of mom and pop happen to be the same as the interests of a billionaire hedge fund manager. But that doesn't reduce the level of interest of mom and pop.\" To outsiders, Lewis's banking expertise looks pretty solid, which is as much a function of how little most of us know about that world as it is of Lewis's verisimilitude. As he himself points out, he really didn't work in the banking sector for long, starting a career in his mid-20s as a bond salesman at Salomon Brothers and getting out at the age of 27 to become a writer. Still, for those short years, which he mostly spent at the Salomon offices in London, he was very successful, riding the 1980s boom and gathering material for his hugely enjoyable memoir about the period, Liar's Poker. The common strand in Lewis's work is his combination of systems analysis with great human interest. Moneyball, which was made into the 2011 movie starring Brad Pitt, told the history of baseball through one man's effort to redefine notions of value in the sport's talent pool. The Blind Side, his book about American football, was made into a blockbuster that earned Sandra Bullock an Oscar. Hollywood pitched it as a heart-warming tale of an unusual family, whereas the actual book contains pages and pages of football analysis, centred around the geeky proposition that quarterbacks are \"only as good as the system they played in\". The Big Short put human faces on the bankers who profited from the housing collapse. It was while he was still at Salomon that Lewis realised he had a set of skills that, if he wanted to become a writer, would give him an advantage in that particular marketplace: understanding of a world that most writers had no contact with. After an art history degree at Princeton, he studied for a master's in economics at the London School of Economics under the former governor of the Bank of England Mervyn King. (\"He was fabulous. A lot of the professors I had were crusty old English guys with hair coming out of their ears. They weren't worldly. He was; he was very smart.\") There was a crossover between the two disciplines, trading and journalism, which Lewis identifies now as \"a certain sneakiness. Getting stories often requires an amount of sneakiness. Beyond that, a certain social ability. You have to get along with people. It helps to have the minimum necessary analytical ability.\" While still at Salomon he started writing anonymous dispatches from the trading floor and publishing them in the Spectator and the Sunday Telegraph, and could see from the response that he was on to something. \"They would go the equivalent of viral before the internet. People would photocopy them and hand them out on the trading floor. No one knew it was me. So I could see that it was working.\" Liar's Poker did so well, says Lewis, that \"I thought: I'm a free man. A lot of the stuff I did afterwards was all over the place. It was magazine stuff. I'd write essays, I wrote about everything. There was no pattern to the stuff I was doing. I covered politics for the New Republic.\" The books he wrote ranged across genres, too, so that he thinks of himself these days as more of a sports writer than anything else. \"Or a travel writer. If I had to pick one genre of non-fiction, it'd be travel writing.\" Liar's Poker, he says, was in some ways a travel book \u2013 the story of \"me moving through space\". Of all Lewis's books, it was The Blind Side that did least well when it was first published, tanking until the film came out and drove a million sales. \"The problem is that people who like football do not read. And if they read, they don't want an emotional chick flick buried in their book. It was not a good business idea.\" More recently, he wrote a huge, moony profile of Barack Obama for Vanity Fair, the most incisive part of which was Lewis's analysis of the president's basketball skills: \"Not flashy, but he slides in to take charges, passes well, and does a lot of little things well,\" he wrote. \"The only risk he takes is his shot, but he shoots so seldom, and so carefully, that it actually isn't much of a risk at all.\" The rest of it reads along the lines of a 15-year-old's daydream after a Justin Bieber concert (\"I gazed up to find Obama staring down at me \u2026\" \"'I feel a little creepy being here,' I said. 'Why don't I get out of your hair?' He laughed. 'C'mon,' he said \u2026\" etc). We all have our weaknesses. Thanks to the success of Lewis's books, people frequently ring him with ideas about what to do next, which most of the time he ignores. In 2009, he received a call from an old contact, a lawyer, who said he had a client Lewis might be interested in writing about. This was Sergey Aleynikov, the former Goldman Sachs programmer arrested by the FBI and ultimately jailed for \"stealing code\" from the bank. \"It's an incredible story,\" says Lewis, \"and I said yeah, yeah, yeah and ignored him for a year and a half.\" During that time, he mulled over what could be so valuable as to justify what looked, from the outside, like an extraordinary overreaction on the part of Goldman Sachs. \"I didn't understand the code \u2013 what had he taken? It was very fishy, the way Goldman Sachs reacted to it. No matter how valuable it was, calling the FBI was a really extreme thing to do. And to do it so quickly. And it was pretty clear from the newspaper descriptions that no one understood what he'd taken.\" Lewis spoke to a few investors, started looking into high-frequency trading, and was ultimately told about someone who would go on to motor his whole story, Brad Katsuyama, or as he was described to Lewis at the time: \"There's this one guy who works for the Royal Bank of Canada.\" One of the criticisms of the book has been that it doesn't identify any one villain, something Lewis says was deliberate. \"I made a very conscious decision at the beginning not to do that. The reason is: everyone's involved.\" Does he understand the 10 lines of code that execute a trader's orders? No. \"But there's a predator, and a guy figures out he's the prey. Then he figures out how the predator's trying to kill him and tries to stop the predator. The basic story was pretty simple.\" Given how large the financial stakes are, it's surprising, I suggest, that there isn't more corporate assassination. Lewis laughs. \"Brad asked me if he should get security. And I thought maybe before the book came out. But now, it'd be a little obvious.\" Lewis takes roughly 18 months to write a book: a year on the research and structure, and five months to hammer it out. At the same time, he continues with his journalism, writes screenplays and with his wife Tabitha Soren, a photographer and former reporter for MTV News, raises their three children. Lewis's book Home Game was about fatherhood and his memoir Coach was the story of his high-school baseball experiences, which is in the process of being turned into a film. As is Flash Boys. The day before we meet, Lewis sold the rights to Columbia Pictures and Scott Rudin, who successfully made Moneyball. The irony is that when Lewis quit banking, it was for a $40,000 (\u00a324,000) book contract that indicated he would never make the kind of money he had as a 25-year-old bond salesman. Although actually, he says, looking at the kinds of figures earned by the characters in Flash Boys, who knows? \"I might still have done better in banking. The thing is, I have a sense of what my trajectory inside the financial world would've been and I would've ended up in long-term capital management at Salomon Brothers, and that collapsed. They lost all their money. I'd have been wiped out.\" Anyway, he thought it would be a meaningless life. \"I didn't belong there. It's hard to remember what it feels like to be 27; you're immortal. You can do anything you want.\" The accident of his career is, he says, that he has been so well-placed to document an industry \"that has gone insane. The financial markets have generated this fantastic material. I don't think anything else like this will walk in my door.\" And he hopes the fact that the world's best and brightest \u2013 French particle physicists, Russian aerospace engineers, wunderkind Chinese programmers \u2013 all go into banking these days, because the financial rewards are so huge, is a historical anomaly. \"It's very odd. We think of it as normal, but those sorts of people throughout history have not gone into banking. They've done useful things. The sorts of people who used to go into banking were pleasant, jolly chaps, the class monitor who gets on with everyone. That's who should be in banking. That's what we need!\" Why? \"Because the smart people are too dangerous. They find ways to game the system.\" \u2022 Michael Lewis is speaking at the Royal Geographical Society, London, on 30 April.

That said, the decline in real wages has been so severe that it will probably take another four years until we recover from the losses of the past six years. <br> Today\u2019s figures suggest that the labour market is in good shape. The economy is creating jobs and we continue to make progress towards the Chancellor\u2019s aim of achieving the highest employment rate in the G7 - in the past year alone the employment rate has risen by 1.2 percentage points.  At the same time unemployment is steadily falling back and, having breached the 7% threshold, we are now officially in phase two of forward guidance. Nevertheless, with the labour force continuing to expand strongly and levels of under-employment remaining high, even if job growth remains robust it will still be some time until we have used up enough slack to force the MPC\u2019s hand. We continue to forecast that the first interest rate hike will come in the second half of 2015.  The combination of higher employment levels and a steady pickup in real wages should help to put the consumer recovery on a stronger footing, lessening the reliance of households saving less to finance their spending. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-534e5290e4b07648e2d90fd3\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-04-16T09:53:39.736Z\">10.53am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Paul Flowers charged</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Paul Flowers, the disgraced former chairman of the Co-op, has been charged.

Employment surged by 239k in the last 3 months \u2013 more than double the pace of increase that was expected. Similarly, unemployment was down by almost 80k in the last 3 months.</p> <p>A couple of health warnings are warranted. 146k of the headline increase in employment was due to an increase in self-employment. </p> <p>While there is nothing wrong with being self-employed, this trend shows that the pace of hiring by firms is not as super strong as at face value. A worst case scenario is that displaced workers (for example let go by the public sector as part of the austerity programme) are setting up as self-employed to generate income to keep paying the bills. These may not be as productive and profitable as jobs in firms, so the strength of the headline reading is probably a bit misleading.</p> <p>Jobs numbers aside, wage inflation rose to 1.7% y/y from 1.4% previously. That wasn\u2019t quite as high as expected, but was still a decent rise and now outpaces CPI inflation for the first time in 4 years.</p> <p>Overall, a very robust report.

While employment growth is expected to have slowed for the third successive month from the exceptionally vigorous pace seen late last year, the data might well show that the headline ILO unemployment rate dropped to the Bank of England\u2019s initial policy guidance threshold of 7.0% in the three months to February. Moreover, regular wages growth is also likely to have taken a further step up in the three months to February, with the expected rise of 1.7%Y/Y set to take it above consumer price inflation for the first time since July 2009.</p> </blockquote> <p>Paul Hollingworth at Capital Economics says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The latest labour market figures are likely to show that the jobs recovery continued apace in February (09.30 BST). The strength of the jobs surveys, taken alongside the 34,600 monthly fall in the claimant count in January, suggests that the headline (three month average) unemployment rate probably fell from 7.2% in November to about 7.0% in February. Meanwhile, the latest earnings data should confirm that the squeeze on real pay is now over. Survey measures of workers\u2019 pay continue to point to a strong pick-up in earnings growth. We expect the headline (three-month average) rate to increase to 1.9% in February, above CPI inflation of 1.7% the same month. </p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2014-04-16T07:52:32.471Z\">at 8.52am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-534e343ee4b07c34eebba6e4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-04-16T07:43:48.438Z\">8.43am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Tesco boss <b>Philip Clarke</b>, who took over from Sir Terry Leahy three years ago, has been accused of dismantling his predecessor's legacy. <b>He is facing calls to step down from some of Tesco's biggest shareholders</b>, <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/b75c4030-c4bd-11e3-9aeb-00144feabdc0.html?siteedition=uk#axzz2z26FoH8c\">the Financial Times reported yesterday</a>.

Despite the despair surrounding the shares, Tesco remains the UK\u2019s largest supermarket by some considerable margin, the actual profit number is significant and, from an investment perspective, the dividend yield of 5% is attractive. However, these factors have not been enough to arrest a share price decline of 26% over the last year, during which time the wider FTSE100 has added 4%. The encroachment of the discounters in the grocery space, cut throat margins and difficult trading conditions both home and abroad have conspired to put Tesco in the full glare of the bears and the accompanying management outlook comments seem to echo that the recovery is a long term plan.  The current market consensus of the supermarkets as a whole remains noncommittal and, within the sector, Tesco continues to take the brunt of investor exasperation, with the shares coming in at a sell.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-534e3180e4b07c34eebba6e3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-04-16T07:31:56.233Z\">8.31am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>For all the talk of Tesco's UK business being in trouble, it is the best performing of all their regions : UK trading profit is down 3.6%, Asia is down 5.6% and Europe down 27.7%, notes independent City analyst <b>Louise Cooper</b>.

That is almost half the clean pre tax profit figure - a significant amount. And yet international expansion continues. Just as Tesco finally exits the American \"Fresh and Easy\" in this set of results, it announces that is to set up only clothing stores - F&amp;F - in the world's most competitive and well served clothing market (America). What is the betting that it F&amp;F goes the same way F&amp;E?</p> <p>Tesco is clearly still committed to international growth, even if it exited both America and China at great cost. To quote \u201cstrategic priority of pursuing disciplined international growth\u201d and the aim to \u201callocate capital to the markets where see most potential \u2013 Korea, Malaysia and Thailand\u201d. And yet elsewhere it admits to problems in Korea with restrictive opening hours and the damage done to its Thai business from political unrest and the corresponding damage to the economy. </p> <p>Tesco is clearly in a stronger position than Morrison's or the Co-Op, it is bigger and better capitalised. But these results suggest that the CEO Philip Clarke has still not grasped the nettle. Like Marc Bolland tinkering with adverts rather than focusing on getting the product and price right, Philip Clarke is tinkering at International expansion and not focusing on the core UK business.

As the case nears its end, it has lasted for 43 days and put the spotlight on the bank which almost bankrupted Ireland when the Celtic Tiger boom burst. Sean Fitzpatrick, William McAteer and Pat Whelan deny all charges against them in relation to the alleged illegal lending of millions of euros to 16 investors including Ireland's one time richest man Sean Quinn. US markets have opened higher, boosted by those slightly better than expected Chinese growth figures. Dow Jones: +0.56% at 16,353.27 S&amp;P 500: +0.52% at 1,852.58 Nasdaq: +0.48% at 3,503.55 Europe's markets have also made further gains, no doubt spurred on by optimism on Wall Street. In other corporate news, Starbucks is moving its European headquarters to London from Amsterdam after a row over tax avoidance. This could mean that it will pay more tax in the UK. The move is due to be completed by the end of the year. More than half of its European outlets are in the UK. Last year, the world's largest coffee chain handed over \u00a35m to HM Revenue &amp; Customs \u2013 its first corporation tax payment in five years. Bank of America has been pushed into the red by a $6bn litigation charge, reporting its first loss for nearly three years. It made a net loss of $276m, or 5 cents a share, in the first quarter, compared with a profit of $1.5bn a year ago. This caught analysts by surprise \u2013 they had expected a profit of \u00a3833m. The investment bank took a $3.6bn charge on its $9.5bn settlement with the Federal Housing Finance Agency \u2013 the largest payout made to a regulator over misleading mortgage sales tactics in the run-up to the financial crisis. Sports Direct, run by Newcastle United owner Mike Ashley, has been the biggest riser on the FTSE 100 index all day, after Bank of America Merrill Lynch issued a bullish note on the stock. The bank said Sports Direct had potential to increase top line profits at a compound annual growth rate of 7% over the next decade, driven by online sales and expansion into Europe. Talking about the market generally, Coutts global equity strategist James Butterfill said: Investors have taken Chinese growth numbers positively, but they are cautiously optimistic as defensive sectors are in favour today. Aside from some possible seasonal weakness in May, we like equities. We are positive on healthcare stocks, which remain good value with an attractive dividend yield. Pharmaceutical shares \u2013 seen as defensive stocks \u2013 are among the top performers, with GlaxoSmithKline, AstraZeneca and Shire all rising about 1%. Here is our lunchtime summary. The debate is raging about whether this is the end of the cost of living crisis, after official figures showed pay growth in the UK has finally overtaken inflation again, for the first time in years. Tesco boss Philip Clarke has come out defiant, saying he has no intention of quitting, despite a 6% fall in profits at Britain's biggest retailer and \u00a31.3bn of writedowns The former Co-op Bank chairman Paul Flowers has been charged with drug offences Stock markets have been buoyed by slightly stronger-than-expected Chinese growth data. China's economy grew by 7.4% in the first quarter and retail sales were also a tad better than forecast. The FTSE 100 is 0.5% ahead (following yesterday's 0.6% fall) while Germany's Dax and France's CAC have gained 0.9% Here is the full story on Britain's job market, from my colleague Angela Monaghan. And you can read our comment piece, by Anne Perkins, on the ailing king of the high street here. Tesco: the supermarket where the squeezed middle don't want to be. One of the curious things about Tesco is that it grew so big it stopped being just another retail outlet. It became the focus for everything unsatisfactory about the supermarket way of doing business: the death of the small retailer, the draining of the life blood of the high street, the unfair treatment of suppliers, the way farmers were driven out of business. The more of us shopped there, the fatter it grew, the more it was hated. ... but the TUC disagrees, saying people are NOT celebrating an end to their cost of living squeeze yet. TUC general secretary Frances O\u2019Grady said: With wages increasing by just 1.7%, barely enough to keep up with a prices measure that doesn\u2019t even include housing costs, the cost of living crisis is far from solved. This is not worth even half a cheer. Workers are still on average \u00a340 a week worse off than they were in 2010, and we will need months of much better figures to take us anywhere near a recovery to pre-crash living standards. This government will have at best presided over more than three times as many months when living standards fell than when they rose. It\u2019s encouraging that the economy is creating jobs \u2013 and that young people are finally sharing in the jobs improvements. But this only tells part of the story. With three in five recent jobs created being self-employed, many people find that work no longer offers the security, basic workplace rights and decent pay that most expect. The time to celebrate recovery will be when ordinary workers return to pre-crash living standards and the economy is generating more secure skilled jobs with good prospects and decent pay. Back to the jobs market. Andrew Goodwin, senior economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club, said this is the beginning of the end of the cost living crisis. With earnings growth finally pulling into line with inflation, today marks the beginning of the end of the cost of living crisis. As the recovery firms up, the labour market tightens and skills shortages start to appear we should see wage growth gradually accelerate and establish a clear gap over inflation. That said, the decline in real wages has been so severe that it will probably take another four years until we recover from the losses of the past six years. Today\u2019s figures suggest that the labour market is in good shape. The economy is creating jobs and we continue to make progress towards the Chancellor\u2019s aim of achieving the highest employment rate in the G7 - in the past year alone the employment rate has risen by 1.2 percentage points. At the same time unemployment is steadily falling back and, having breached the 7% threshold, we are now officially in phase two of forward guidance. Nevertheless, with the labour force continuing to expand strongly and levels of under-employment remaining high, even if job growth remains robust it will still be some time until we have used up enough slack to force the MPC\u2019s hand. We continue to forecast that the first interest rate hike will come in the second half of 2015. The combination of higher employment levels and a steady pickup in real wages should help to put the consumer recovery on a stronger footing, lessening the reliance of households saving less to finance their spending. Paul Flowers, the disgraced former chairman of the Co-op, has been charged. Here is the statement from West Yorkshire police. This is an update in relation to an investigation into allegations of drugs supply offences made in a national newspaper. Paul Flowers, 63, of Hollingwood Drive, Bradford, has been charged with two offences of possession of a Class A drug and one offence of possession of a Class C drug. He has been bailed to appear before Leeds Magistrates on 7 May. The Co-op's group results are out tomorrow morning. While pay growth in the UK has picked up, it wasn't as strong as many economists expected. Nick Beecroft, senior market analyst at Saxo Capital Markets, also said: The wisdom of the Bank of England\u2019s decision to move the goalposts on forward guidance, away from the single metric of the ILO Unemployment rate to a more holistic range of economic indicators, has been brought into stark relief by this morning\u2019s employment data. The headline rate fell unexpectedly to 6.9%, its lowest level since February 2009, from 7.2% last month and against expectations of 7.1%. While the market looks to be focused on the headline unemployment rate fall, Monument Securities strategist Marc Ostwald reckons the Bank of England's monetary policy committee will be looking far more closely at the breakdown \u2013 which offers \"no justification to shift to a more hawkish rate trajectory\". ING economist James Knightley says: The people in work, the wages story and the underemployment figures are all very encouraging and suggest that the \u201cslack\u201d in the labour market is shrinking. As such, while we are still sticking with our view that the first BoE rate hike will come in February next year, the relative strength in the economy means we feel the risks are skewed towards an earlier move rather than a later one. Alan Clarke at Scotiabank cautions that some of the improvement in the job market was due to another increase in self-employment. On the face of it the UK labour report was super strong. Employment surged by 239k in the last 3 months \u2013 more than double the pace of increase that was expected. Similarly, unemployment was down by almost 80k in the last 3 months. A couple of health warnings are warranted. 146k of the headline increase in employment was due to an increase in self-employment. While there is nothing wrong with being self-employed, this trend shows that the pace of hiring by firms is not as super strong as at face value. A worst case scenario is that displaced workers (for example let go by the public sector as part of the austerity programme) are setting up as self-employed to generate income to keep paying the bills. These may not be as productive and profitable as jobs in firms, so the strength of the headline reading is probably a bit misleading. Jobs numbers aside, wage inflation rose to 1.7% y/y from 1.4% previously. That wasn\u2019t quite as high as expected, but was still a decent rise and now outpaces CPI inflation for the first time in 4 years. Overall, a very robust report. It shows that spare capacity in the wider economy is being eroded and we are moving closer to the point where the BoE will consider removing policy accommodation. Turning to stock markets, the FTSE 100 index has gained nearly 30 points, or 0.44% to 6570.67. Germany's Dax has climbed more than 90 points, or 1%, to 9265.93, while France's CAC is also 1% ahead, or 45.83 points, at 4391.18. In London, Tesco shares have shrugged off the poor results and are trading 3.2% higher at 295.55p. I guess people are thinking the figures could have been worse. Rachel Reeves, Labour\u2019s Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary, says it's \"deeply complacent\" for the Tories to claim the cost of living crisis has suddenly been solved. While this fall in overall unemployment is welcome, today\u2019s figures show nearly 900,000 young people are unemployed and long-term youth unemployment has soared under David Cameron. The government should introduce Labour\u2019s Compulsory Jobs Guarantee to get young people into work. At long last earnings are finally rising faster than CPI inflation when bonuses are included, but after four years when prices have risen faster than wages there is a huge amount of lost ground to catch up. Working people are now over \u00a31600 a year worse off than when David Cameron came to office, most people are not feeling any recovery and the link between the wealth of the nation and family finances remains broken. It\u2019s deeply complacent and out of touch for the Tories to try and claim this deep-seated cost-of-living crisis has suddenly been solved. Only Labour has a clear plan to earn our way to higher living standards for all, not just a few at the top. So here's the detail on the labour market. Britain's job market has staged a much stronger recovery than expected in recent months, catching the Bank of England on the hop. You can read the Office for National Statistics' release here. Pay growth came in at 1.7% in the three months to February. Inflation slowed to 1.6% in March, official figures showed yesterday. This marks the first time wages are growing faster than price increases since the height of the financial crisis in 2008, apart from a brief period in 2010. Economists note that consistent real wage gains have not been seen in the UK since the beginning of the global financial crisis. In February alone, pay growth was 1.9%. The unemployment rate has unexpectedly fallen to 6.9% in the three months to February, the lowest since early 2009 and compared with 7.2% in the three months to January. (It is still higher than the pre-downturn trough of 5.2% in late 2007/early 2008. This is below the 7% threshold originally stated by the Bank of England for considering higher interest rates, but the Bank has since given new guidance on monetary policy. It will also assess how much slack there is in the economy before it puts up interest rates. The number of people claiming Jobseeker's Allowance fell by 30,400 to 1.14m in March, the lowest level since November 2008. The pre-downturn trough was 778,400 in February 2008. Youth unemployment is at the lowest level since 2009. The labour market figures are out: Britain's unemployment rate fell more than expected, to 6.9% from 7.2%, while pay growth finally caught up with \u2013 and outstripped \u2013 inflation for the first time in years. Burberry on the other hand has been buoyed by 20% sales growth in Asia. It's the last set of figures from chief executive Angela Ahrendts, widely credited with transforming Burberry's fortunes, who departs next month for a job at Apple. My colleague Jennifer Rankin writes: Luxury fashion chain Burberry has seen no let-up in Chinese demand for its handbags, perfumes and distinctive check scarves, with double-digit growth across Asia boosting its sales figures. The company posted a 19% growth in revenues to \u00a31.3bn for the six months to the end of March, fuelled by 19% growth in sales across the Asia region. Burberry recently opened a flagship store in Shanghai, its largest store in Asia, modelled on one of its London shops. Asia now accounts for 40% of Burberry revenues, but the company also posted a 21% growth in revenues in Europe, the Middle East, India and Africa. In the Americas, where Burberry has a smaller presence, revenues were up 27% to \u00a3320m. You can read our full Tesco story here, from our retail correspondent Zoe Wood. Let's take a look at expectations for the UK job market figures, out at 9.30am BST. Economists at Daiwa have done a helpful preview: Attention in the UK will be on the latest labour market report. While employment growth is expected to have slowed for the third successive month from the exceptionally vigorous pace seen late last year, the data might well show that the headline ILO unemployment rate dropped to the Bank of England\u2019s initial policy guidance threshold of 7.0% in the three months to February. Moreover, regular wages growth is also likely to have taken a further step up in the three months to February, with the expected rise of 1.7%Y/Y set to take it above consumer price inflation for the first time since July 2009. Paul Hollingworth at Capital Economics says: The latest labour market figures are likely to show that the jobs recovery continued apace in February (09.30 BST). The strength of the jobs surveys, taken alongside the 34,600 monthly fall in the claimant count in January, suggests that the headline (three month average) unemployment rate probably fell from 7.2% in November to about 7.0% in February. Meanwhile, the latest earnings data should confirm that the squeeze on real pay is now over. Survey measures of workers\u2019 pay continue to point to a strong pick-up in earnings growth. We expect the headline (three-month average) rate to increase to 1.9% in February, above CPI inflation of 1.7% the same month. Tesco boss Philip Clarke, who took over from Sir Terry Leahy three years ago, has been accused of dismantling his predecessor's legacy. He is facing calls to step down from some of Tesco's biggest shareholders, the Financial Times reported yesterday. It quoted one top 20 investor as saying: Clarke should go. Sir Terry Leahy was one of the great leaders and his legacy has been undermined. Clarke has shown he is the wrong person for the job. He has got the strategy wrong,\u201d the top 20 investor said. He added: \u201cTesco should have realised the threat from the discounters and acted at least 18 months ago. I fear it is now too late. Morrison plans to slash its prices, but Tesco is not cutting its prices on the same scale. That is a mistake. Clarke is simply not of the same calibre as Sir Terry and I can\u2019t see him turning things around, which is why it is time for him to go. And here is Richard Hunter, head of equities at Hargreaves Lansdown Stockbrokers, on Tesco: Whether today marks the nadir of Tesco\u2019s fortunes remains to be seen, as the beleaguered behemoth remains under pressure. There are some glimmers of hope, with progress in the online offering worthy of note, the increasingly important convenience store offering gaining traction and the overall turnaround plan edging ahead. Despite the despair surrounding the shares, Tesco remains the UK\u2019s largest supermarket by some considerable margin, the actual profit number is significant and, from an investment perspective, the dividend yield of 5% is attractive. However, these factors have not been enough to arrest a share price decline of 26% over the last year, during which time the wider FTSE100 has added 4%. The encroachment of the discounters in the grocery space, cut throat margins and difficult trading conditions both home and abroad have conspired to put Tesco in the full glare of the bears and the accompanying management outlook comments seem to echo that the recovery is a long term plan. The current market consensus of the supermarkets as a whole remains noncommittal and, within the sector, Tesco continues to take the brunt of investor exasperation, with the shares coming in at a sell. For all the talk of Tesco's UK business being in trouble, it is the best performing of all their regions : UK trading profit is down 3.6%, Asia is down 5.6% and Europe down 27.7%, notes independent City analyst Louise Cooper. International expansion has cost Tesco dear. She noticed a week before Easter, Tesco was running out of Easter eggs. Apparently they did last year too. \"It may be only one product but it does suggest the rule 'retail is detail' is not being pursued rigorously enough.\" In total international mistakes have cost \u00a31.274bn in just this one set of yearly accounts. That is almost half the clean pre tax profit figure - a significant amount. And yet international expansion continues. Just as Tesco finally exits the American \"Fresh and Easy\" in this set of results, it announces that is to set up only clothing stores - F&amp;F - in the world's most competitive and well served clothing market (America). What is the betting that it F&amp;F goes the same way F&amp;E? Tesco is clearly still committed to international growth, even if it exited both America and China at great cost. To quote \u201cstrategic priority of pursuing disciplined international growth\u201d and the aim to \u201callocate capital to the markets where see most potential \u2013 Korea, Malaysia and Thailand\u201d. And yet elsewhere it admits to problems in Korea with restrictive opening hours and the damage done to its Thai business from political unrest and the corresponding damage to the economy. Tesco is clearly in a stronger position than Morrison's or the Co-Op, it is bigger and better capitalised. But these results suggest that the CEO Philip Clarke has still not grasped the nettle. Like Marc Bolland tinkering with adverts rather than focusing on getting the product and price right, Philip Clarke is tinkering at International expansion and not focusing on the core UK business. It is a classic mistake to make. Don't know what to do at to turn it around, not brave enough to make radical decisions, so tinker elsewhere. Unveiling a 6% fall in annual profits, Phil Clarke, embattled Tesco's chief executive, admitted this morning: Our results today reflect the challenges we face in a trading environment which is changing more rapidly than ever before. Competition has intensified, particularly at home. Tesco has gone from being the unchallenged market leader in the UK grocery market to a company that's lost its way. It's been making one mistake after another with failed attempts to break into the American and Japanese markets, a costly foray into China that also didn't work out, and a fierce price war at home. The 95-year-old retailer shocked the industry in 2012 when it issued its first profit warning in two decades. Since then, its UK market share has slipped to a near-10-year low. Somewhat surprisingly, Tesco shares are up 3.6% at 296.7p. The FTSE 100 index has opened 0.7% higher. Bryan Roberts, retail insights director at market research firm Kantar Retail EMEA, said: While the decline in profitability and like-for-like UK sales comes as no surprise, it marks the end of a disappointing year for Tesco. Philip Clarke is coming in for a lot of harsh criticism from assorted commentators and ex-colleagues, but we hope that this is the end of the beginning rather than the beginning of the end for his tenure. He has made some tough but necessary decisions on international in particular, but there is still much to be done, in Ireland and Central &amp; Eastern Europe in particular. In the UK, the two missing ingredients are clarity and consistency. The proposition, particularly in pricing, is muddled and confused. Tesco doesn\u2019t necessarily need to have the lowest prices to recover \u2013 instead its pricing needs more clarity, predictability and transparency. Instore standards and execution are incredibly haphazard. Some Tesco stores, in and around London especially, are in the finest shape we\u2019ve seen, while others around the UK are mediocre at best. While there is a lot of great work being completed by Tesco in areas such as online, convenience, digital and London, we are still awaiting some genuinely transformative efforts to regain momentum in Tesco\u2019s mainstream supermarkets across the UK as a whole. Putting shoppers, rather than shareholders, back at the heart of the business would be a good starting point. Business recovery experts Begbies Traynor say the UK\u2019s smallest independent food retailers are by far the biggest unrecognised casualties of the current price war between Britain\u2019s largest supermarket groups, which have slashed prices ahead of the busy Easter weekend in a bid to entice customers back from the popular discounters, Aldi and Lidl. Out of 2,823 UK food retailers suffering significant financial distress this quarter, 95% are SMEs \u2013 a worrying figure to say the least. In a desperate attempt to claw back market share from the discounters, Tesco cut prices by 24% \u2013 and Clarke said there's more to come. Having dominated Britain's grocery market for years, Tesco is now being squeezed between discount chains Aldi and Lidl and upmarket grocers Waitrose and Marks &amp; Spencer. Under-pressure Tesco CEO Philip Clarke just said on a conference call with journalists that he is not going anywhere. Our retail correspondent Zoe Wood reports his comments: I've got no intention of going anywhere. All my waking hours are spent running Tesco, that's what I love. I'm going to see this thing through. Rahul Bajoria and Koon Chow at Barclays Capital have looked at the Chinese numbers: Better Q1 GDP growth suggests no big stimulus or imminent RRR (reserve requirement ratio) or interest rate cuts. GDP growth came in slightly higher than expected for Q1 at 7.4% y/y (Consensus: 7.3%, Barclays: 7.2%, Q4: 7.7%). This may reduce market worries about a much sharper slowdown following the weak M2 and trade data release (not our baseline). It may also lower expectations of a \u2018 big stimulus\u2019 as some market participants have started to call for more aggressive monetary easing, such as RRR or interest rate cuts (not our baseline). That said, we think weaker-than-expected March data release, including industrial production, property investment, imports and exports, PPI, point to continued soft demand, which warrants more supportive measures to stabilise growth. We think the People's Bank of China will be flexible in fine-turning and its policy bias has shifted to neutral-easing. Economists at Daiwa said: Overall, the authorities seem unlikely to panic in response to the latest figures. Nevertheless, with an acceleration in growth required to hit the government\u2019s full-year growth target of 7.5%, further modest stimulus measures would certainly not come as a surprise. Markets will be nervously watching developments in Ukraine, with Russian claims that the country was close to \"civil war\". A flurry of economic data from China this morning will add to market uncertainty \u2013 the Chinese economy grew by 7.4% in the first quarter, down from 7.7% in the fourth quarter of last year (but not quite as bad as some expected \u2013 7.2%). Industrial production bounced back after the factory shutdowns for Chinese New Year. Industrial output rose by 8.8% in March, up from 8.6% in February. But the extent of the rebound was disappointing with some expecting a number above 9%. Meanwhile, retail sales rebounded more strongly than expected from the surprise slowdown over Chinese New Year, coming in at a 12.2% rise, up from 11.8%. All in all, the numbers will fuel speculation of more action from Chinese authorities aimed at meeting their 7.5% growth target. Here is some early reaction to Tesco. Phil Dorrell, director of the retail consultancy Retail Remedy, says Tesco \"has come unstuck\". The Tesco juggernaut is juddering to a halt. Tesco has got real problems and its grand turnaround strategy, as yet, has failed to address them. For the first time ever, you could say that Tesco has come unstuck. It's blaming tough trading conditions and increased competition but other grocers are managing to perform in the same environment. While Tesco dithers, the discounters are drawing in new customers with great prices, surprising ranges and super quality. Their proposition is simple and delivered almost effortlessly. They have an energy and a drive that Tesco has lost. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and the business world. We are waking up to results from Tesco, Britain's biggest retailer. The supermarket giant has reported a 6% fall in annual trading profits to \u00a33.3bn, with like-for-like sales down 3% in the fourth quarter. This marks the second year of falling profits following 20 years of unbroken growth, piling more pressure on Tesco boss Philip Clarke. Tesco has taken big writedowns totalling about \u00a31.3bn, including a \u00a3540m charge from its exit from China with the rest relating to Europe. Later this morning, at 9.30am BST, we will get UK unemployment data which are expected to show that wages grew faster than inflation for the first time since 2008. After a turbulent session in US stock markets yesterday, which ended the session up sharply, European markets are expected to follow their lead and open higher this morning. US markets got pulled in both directions \u2013 by better corporate results on the one hand, and disappointing economic figures on the other. Striking a somewhat poetic note, Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: For now it seems that the bulls and bears are fighting it out for supremacy in an environment that is fertile ground for both at the moment as equity markets dance to an uncertain tune.",

Average earnings are picking up and finally outpacing prices. With the labour market as strong as that, surely an increase in interest rates must be coming? That's certainly what the City thinks. Sterling rose after the unemployment figures were released and dealers have advanced the date at which they expect the Bank of England to push up the cost of borrowing. And there is a case for the Bank of England rethinking its strategy. At 6.9%, the jobless rate is below the 7% threshold announced by Mark Carney last summer: the point at which the Bank's nine-strong monetary policy committee would assess whether a rate increase was needed. The Bank modified its forward guidance after unemployment fell more rapidly than expected last autumn and says it will look at a range of indicators to assess the health of the labour market. The latest figures from the Office for National Statistics show that some of these indicators point to a tighter labour market. Vacancies are rising and the number of people working part-time because they can't find a full-time job is falling. The labour market expert John Philpott notes that the increase in net new jobs in 2013 \u2013 993,000 \u2013 was one of the best performances in decades and more typical of the late stages of a boom, rather than the early stages of a recovery. Even so, the Bank is unlikely to rush into an early rate rise. Why? Because the unemployment data is still patchy and not quite as strong as it looks at first glance. Employment was up by 239,000 in the three months to February but self-employment accounted for 146,000 of the increase. Part-time work rose by 74,000. Employment is on the increase in all sectors of the economy barring the public sector, but the role played by the housing market in the recovery is illustrated by the 175,000 increase in jobs from construction and real estate. What's more, earnings are only outstripping inflation once bonuses are taken into account. Basic pay, due to the public sector squeeze, is still running below the annual increase in the cost of living. Pay growth remains weak and the headline rate of inflation is just 1.6%. For the past couple of months, Carney and his MPC colleagues have pointed out that they are in no hurry to raise rates. They are likely to take more notice of the details of the labour market statistics rather than the headline numbers.",

York-based Persimmon said it has sold 7,200 homes for 2014, a 38% advance on last year. The average selling price has risen by 3% to \u00a3200,400. Visitor levels are up 10%, while cancellations on purchases are at historic lows. It has also been a winner from Help to Buy, accruing 5,000 home sales in the first year of the government-backed mortgage subsidy scheme. In their trading statement Persimmon welcomed a recent decision to extend the scheme by four years to the end of the decade. Persimmon shares were up almost 2% to \u00a312.90. The results are likely to win approval from shareholders gathering at York racecourse later on Wednesday for the company's annual general meeting, where they will vote on whether to return \u00a3213m to investors. These buoyant results come one day after official statistics revealed that house prices in the UK had risen by 9.1% in the year to February 2014, and by 17.7% in London. The average house price is now \u00a3253,000, or \u00a3196,000 excluding London and the south east. The data prompted warnings from the free-market thinktank the Adam Smith Institute and campaign group Shelter that the housing market, especially in London, is \"out of control\". But the government insists that mortgage lending remains below the historic average. The demand-supply imbalance in the capital was underlined by Telford Homes, a smaller developer focused on London, which expects its profits to double this year. The company, which describes itself as operating in \"relatively affordable areas of inner London\", reported strong advances sales well into 2017. It has already sold 98% of homes on its advance sales list for the year ending March 2015, over 70% for 2016 and 25% for 2017. \"The London property market has remained buoyant, with demand from those wanting to live in London remaining well in excess of the supply of new homes,\" it said.",

      "bodyText": "Embattled Tesco boss Philip Clarke has signalled it could take another three years to turn around the struggling UK chain and insisted he would be there to finish the job. After a second year of falling group profits investors are losing confidence in Clarke whose antidote to decreasing sales has been costly store refurbishments and price cuts judged small beer in comparison with rivals' promises. \"I think [the UK business] has started to turn,\" said Clarke, who claimed he was \"two-fifths\" of the way through the \"big and bold plan\" launched in the wake of a shock profit warning in 2012. \"I've got no intention of going anywhere. All my waking hours are spent running Tesco \u2013 it's what I love. I'm going to see this thing through.\" But there were no signs of recovery in the retailer's annual figures with profits at the UK chain falling for the third year, down 3.6% to \u00a32.2bn in the year to 22 February. At a group level profits were down 6% at \u00a33.3bn as stores in Asia and central Europe were buffeted by local economic and political problems as well as self-inflicted trading issues. The fall in profits was accompanied by \u00a31.3bn of writedowns on the value of its European and Chinese operations. The charge is on top of last year's \u00a31bn impairment on failed US venture Fresh &amp; Easy. Analysts and investors are increasingly concerned that Clarke, who has worked for Tesco for 40 years, is not the right man for the job. He has spent more than \u00a31bn on store refurbishments, extra staff and revamped product ranges, yet the most recent industry data from Kantar Worldpanel shows its market share languishing at a near 10-year low of 28.6%. At its peak, in October 2007, Tesco's share hit 31.8%. \"This is a business that is struggling and there is no clear sign that management have got sufficiently big plans to turn it around,\" said one investor. \"The calls for a change in leadership are only getting louder.\" In the fourth quarter UK like-for-like sales tumbled 3% \u2013 the worst fall since Clarke took over from Sir Terry Leahy in 2011 \u2013 and he warned of more bad news to come. Price cuts, fewer promotions and disruptions caused by store refits would all put a \"drag\" on sales this year, Clarke said. Asked by one analyst if investors could expect no underlying growth for three years, Clarke gave a cautious reply. \"No I don't think we are preparing people for that. We are watching the actions of our competitors very carefully and they are far from clear.\" To win back shoppers Tesco launched the first wave of a \u00a3200m price cutting campaign back in February. The cuts are focused on staple foods such as milk, bread and vegetables and the retailer said prices were coming down by an average of 24%. Clarke said shoppers wanted more \"stable\" prices and promised more cuts to come. \"We have always said \u00a3200m was the start. We retained the flexibility to do what we thought was necessary, and we will. You will see more prices coming down at Tesco in the weeks and months ahead.\" Shore Capital analyst Clive Black said shoppers increasingly thought the big supermarkets \"speak with forked tongue\" about prices as despite talk of price wars official figures show food price inflation picking up. \"The time has come for Tesco to show leadership on price,\" he said. Tesco launched a store refurbishment programme in 2012 and Clarke said the 300 stores it had revamped were delivering sales increases of 3%-5%.\"Where the strategy is in place, it works,\" he said. It will do another 650 this year which he said was a project on an unprecedented scale for the retailer and would cause some sales disruption. It also sees scope to downsize up to 100 of its biggest stores with space let to other retailers or attractions such as soft play areas. As shoppers turn their backs on big stores Tesco has been introducing trendy food brands such as Harris + Hoole coffee shops and Giraffe restaurants which Clarke said were increasingly making its larger premises a \"destination for Sunday brunch\". It will take three years to complete the refurbishment of the UK chain. The \u00a31.3bn international writedown included a \u00a3734m hit on the value of its European stores as weak sales in key markets such as Ireland and Poland showed no sign of letting up. After failing to crack China on its own, Tesco resorted to a joint venture last year, sparking a \u00a3540m writedown. The problems in central Europe resulted in a 27.7% fall in profits to \u00a3238m while in Asia they declined 5.6% at \u00a3692m, but with both divisions showing progress the shares closed up 7.5p at 293.8p. Confidence in the UK's biggest retailer has also been dented by a string of senior departures. At the start of this month its finance director Laurie McIlwee tendered his resignation. He is the last member of the senior team other than Clarke to have served alongside Leahy on the board. McIlwee, who had been criticised by investors for his forecasting skills, but denied that there had been a rift over strategy. At what was his final analyst presentation he joked - to nervous laughter \u2013 that he had \"two words to say to the City\". There was relief when they turned out to be \"thank you\".",

      "body": "<p>Embattled Tesco boss Philip Clarke has signalled it could take another three years to turn around the struggling UK chain and insisted he would be there to finish the job.</p> <p>After a second year of falling group profits investors are losing confidence in Clarke whose antidote to decreasing sales has been costly store refurbishments and price cuts judged small beer in comparison with rivals' promises.</p> <p>\"I think [the UK business] has started to turn,\" said Clarke, who claimed he was \"two-fifths\" of the way through the \"big and bold plan\" launched in the wake of a shock profit warning in 2012. \"I've got no intention of going anywhere. All my waking hours are spent running Tesco \u2013 it's what I love. I'm going to see this thing through.\"</p> <p>But there were no signs of recovery in the retailer's annual figures with profits at the UK chain falling for the third year, down 3.6% to \u00a32.2bn in the year to 22 February. At a group level profits were down 6% at \u00a33.3bn as stores in Asia and central Europe were buffeted by local economic and political problems as well as self-inflicted trading issues. The fall in profits was accompanied by \u00a31.3bn of writedowns on the value of its European and Chinese operations. The charge is on top of last year's \u00a31bn impairment on failed US venture Fresh &amp; Easy.</p> <p>Analysts and investors are increasingly concerned that Clarke, who has worked for Tesco for 40 years, is not the right man for the job. He has spent more than \u00a31bn on store refurbishments, extra staff and revamped product ranges, yet the most recent industry data from Kantar Worldpanel shows its market share languishing at a near 10-year low of 28.6%. At its peak, in October 2007, Tesco's share hit 31.8%.</p> <p>\"This is a business that is struggling and there is no clear sign that management have got sufficiently big plans to turn it around,\" said one investor. \"The calls for a change in leadership are only getting louder.\"</p> <p>In the fourth quarter UK like-for-like sales tumbled 3% \u2013 the worst fall since Clarke took over from Sir Terry Leahy in 2011 \u2013 and he warned of more bad news to come. Price cuts, fewer promotions and disruptions caused by store refits would all put a \"drag\" on sales this year, Clarke said. Asked by one analyst if investors could expect no underlying growth for three years, Clarke gave a cautious reply. \"No I don't think we are preparing people for that.

      "bodyText": "Burberry has yet to confirm a leaving date for chief executive Angela Ahrendts, who resigned in October to join Apple but would be due to collect an \u00a38m share bonus from the British fashion retailer in June. Ahrendts is free to leave Burberry this month, having worked her six-month notice period, but the American promised to stay on until the middle of this year to smooth a handover to her successor Christopher Bailey, currently chief creative officer. Remaining until 6 June would also allow her to collect two multimillion pound share bonuses relating to performance over the last few years. However, it is thought Ahrendts wants to leave next month to take up her new post and some have suggested the most likely reason no leaving date has been confirmed is that she is wrangling with Burberry and Apple over compensation for the payout in June. \"It's a big sum of money. In some ways it would be good to see the business moving on after six months of handover time. You want to see clarity,\" said Rahul Sharma, an analyst at Neev Capital. But he said investors were also likely to feel reassured by Ahrendt's presence ahead of some big moves for Burberry and continuing concerns about Bailey's ability to combine his creative role with that of a chief executive. \"That is a big concern in the back of investors' minds and Ahrendt's presence delays that point of judgment,\" he said. Ahrendts' exit may also be delayed as she helps put the final flourishes to Burberry's plan to take back its Japanese licence in-house when it comes up for renewal next year. The move, expected to be confirmed at Burberry's full-year results announcement next month, would be a major change for one of the company's most important markets which currently sells a rather different range of products from those in Europe and even China. Burberry on Wednesday said it had seen no let-up in Chinese demand for its handbags, perfumes and raincoats featuring its distinctive check, with double-digit growth across Asia boosting its sales figures. The company reported 19% growth in sales to \u00a31.3bn for the six months to the end of March, fuelled by 19% growth across the Asia region. Burberry recently opened a flagship store in Shanghai, its largest store in Asia, modelled on one of its London shops. Asia now accounts for 40% of Burberry revenues, but the company also reported 21% revenue growth in Europe, the Middle East, India and Africa. In the Americas, where it has a smaller presence, revenues were up 27% to \u00a3320m, led by improved sales of its new beauty ranges. Underlying sales rose 12% as more shoppers were persuaded to spend via customer services including the ability to pick up online orders in stores, helping drive up digital sales by more than 27%. But during the period the company closed almost as many stores as it opened and admitted that the number of visitors to its stores was in decline. It was upbeat about growth prospects for its beauty division, with sales worth \u00a397m in the last six months, a period when it opened its first dedicated makeup and perfume shop in Covent Garden, London. Beauty sales are expected to rise by 25% in the current financial year as more standalone beauty stores are opened and a new fragrance launches this autumn. The strong numbers will further raise expectations on Bailey. Ahrendts said: \"With the management transition well under way, Burberry begins a new year with beauty firmly established as the fifth product division and investment in flagship markets, such as Shanghai, further increasing the brand's appeal to the core luxury customer at home and when travelling.\" However, the company also warned that currency fluctuations could hit 2015 profits, with exchange rates a \"material headwind in what remains an uncertain macro environment\". This concern did not prevent the share price rising 3% to \u00a314.67.",
