      "bodyText": "It is one of the great Hollywood courtroom scenes as Tom Cruise\u2019s preppy lawyer needles the pride of Jack Nicholson\u2019s pugnacious colonel until he explodes with rage and unleashes the devastating \u201cyou can\u2019t handle the truth\u201d rant that destroys him. Will MPs cross-examining Sir Philip Green on Wednesday be able to put in as good a performance as Cruise in a A Few Good Men and get under the skin of the famously short-tempered tycoon who is on the ropes for his role in the biggest British high-street collapse in nearly a decade? It\u2019s obviously not a murder trial, although few would dispute that BHS suffered a slow death at the tycoon\u2019s hands, but Green is on public trial for his decision to offload the 88-year-old chain to a consortium, led by a former racing driver and serial bankrupt Dominic Chappell, which had neither the financial firepower nor retail skills to pull off a turnaround that he, the King of High Street, had failed to effect. On Friday, the Daily Mail spoke for middle Britain with a front page that screamed: \u201cStrip \u2018Sir\u2019 Shifty of his title\u201d. An extreme censure that would put the once lauded businessman in the company of disgraced bank chief Fred Goodwin, who drove the Royal Bank of Scotland to the wall. The case against Green is that over an extended period his family and its other shareholders took out large sums of money from BHS, a tally of close to \u00a3600m in dividends, rental payments and interest on loans during 15 years of ownership. A year on from its sale to the consortium for \u00a31, BHS is in administration and the taxpayer faces a \u00a336m hit on unpaid VAT and statutory compensation owed to workers. Meanwhile, Arcadia, owned by his wife, Tina, which owns a host of other high street names including Miss Selfridge and Dorothy Perkins, is a secured creditor \u2013 the group first in line to receive money back from a liquidation \u2013 and stands to recoup \u00a335m. Then there is the BHS pension fund that, with its \u00a3571m black hole, is being assessed for rescue by the Pension Protection Fund, the pensions lifeboat, an outcome that would surely shame a knight of the realm. Green is being pilloried by a press that gilded his reputation as a retail Midas capable of selling coals to Newcastle. His family\u2019s fortune, much of it in the name of his Monaco-based wife, is put at \u00a33.2bn, amassed via a series of deal in the 00s: BHS for \u00a3200m in 2000 and, two years later, the \u00a3800m purchase of Arcadia. The \u00a31.2bn dividend the Greens paid themselves from Arcadia in 2005 still holds the record as the biggest payout in British corporate history. Critics of his business style argue his wealth has been amassed through clever financial engineering, cost-cutting and squeezing suppliers. Green\u2019s lifestyle of conspicuous consumption \u2013 a new \u00a3100m super yacht, Lionheart, is on the way \u2013 relayed via paparazzi shots of him partying with Kate Moss and enjoying Caribbean getaways with Simon Cowell was tolerated while he was judged to be a wealth creator, but not now. Lord Myners, a former City minister who was chairman of Marks &amp; Spencer when Green launched a takeover bid in 2004, is keen to get to the bottom of the BHS collapse. \u201cWe have learned that over an extended period Green took large sums of money out of BHS and underinvested in the business,\u201d he said. \u201cHe also allowed a large pension deficit to arise and the pension trustees failed to take corrective action.\u201d Some claim that Green was duped by Chappell, but Myners is sceptical: \u201cIt\u2019s inconceivable that Philip Green could be duped by anyone in a financial transaction. I\u2019ve learned that when dealing with Philip it\u2019s best to sup with a long spoon.\u201d At last week\u2019s hearings, Chappell was described by Michael Hitchcock, a former consultant to BHS, as a \u201cmythomaniac\u201d, a term describing someone with \u201cthe tendency to lie, exaggerate or relate incredible imaginary adventures as if they had really happened\u201d. So more The Secret Life of Walter Mitty than A Few Good Men. There was a further incredible plot twist as BHS\u2019s chief executive, Darren Topp, told the committee Chappell had threatened to kill him after he accused him of stealing money. \u201cHe basically said, \u2018It\u2019s my business, I can do what I want. If you kick off about it I\u2019m going to come down there and kill you...\u2019 He says he was in the helicopter squad of the SAS and I know he has got a gun.\u201d The idea that Chappell\u2019s unsuitability as a custodian of BHS was lost on as shrewd a character as Green is one of the main areas MPs are grappling with. But so far the postmortem has been a circular firing squad. Frank Field, chairman of the work and pensions committee, said it was trying to establish whether Green had helped present a picture of Chappell as a credible buyer after it emerged a short-term transfer of funds from a property group had bolstered his credentials. \u201cWe are following the money,\u201d explained Field, who has likened Green to \u201cBanquo\u2019s ghost\u201d hanging over BHS even under new ownership. \u201cWe will be asking [Green]: \u2018Have you asset stripped this company and destroyed 11,000 jobs and the proper payment of pensions to 22,000 pensioners?\u201d On Friday night, it emerged Green was threatening not to appear unless Field resigned. The businessman is understood to be working on a proposal that could resolve the pension crisis but earlier that day the MP told the Financial Times the committee would \u201claugh\u201d if he offered less than \u00a3600m to plug the pension fund. \u201cI am not prepared to participate in a process which has not even the pretence of fairness and objectivity and which has as its primary objective the destruction of my reputation,\u201d wrote Green in a letter to the Birkenhead MP. Green told the Observer he was \u201cundecided\u201d over whether to appear. Sports Direct founder, Mike Ashley, tried to stay away from an inquiry into his business but relented after he was told that he risked \u201clengthy and public\u201d contempt hearings in parliament. Field was unmoved: \u201cThe House of Commons has asked me to chair and him to appear. I will chair and he will appear.\u201d Imagine if it were the bones of M&amp;S rather than BHS that were being picked over. It was Green\u2019s attempt to wrest control of the national treasure in 2004 that earned his acceptance by the establishment, with onlookers impressed by the blue-chip backing he had attracted. Green, aged 64, was born in Croydon but grew up in Hampstead Garden Suburb, an affluent area in north London. He was sent to a Jewish boarding school in Oxfordshire but left at 15 with no O-levels. His father, a small businessman, died when he was 12, and Green started working with his entrepreneurial mother, Alma, who owned a portfolio of garages and car showrooms. He acquired his cockney swagger while serving an apprenticeship in the rag trade, importing jeans from the far east and opening a designer discount store in London. His first significant deal came in 1985 when he acquired Jean Jeanie, a struggling jeans business, for \u00a365,000. Within a year, he had sold it for several million. He went on to run Amber Day, a discount clothes store quoted on the Stock Exchange, but didn\u2019t fit into the corporate world. He was forced out by shareholders in 1992 and retreated to the private arena. One person who knows Green says his best qualities are \u201ca great sense of humour\u201d and \u201cvery loving family\u201d. The couple have three children \u2013 a stepson, Brett Palos, from Tina\u2019s first marriage plus Chloe and Brandon. Green\u2019s acquaintance adds: \u201cPhilip has no spiritual or cultural side. He\u2019s not interested in arts, music or theatre. He\u2019s not well read and is non-active Jewish.\u201d Few of the great and good who have attended Green\u2019s famous birthday extravaganzas have stuck their neck out as the BHS saga unfolds. But they are now being pulled into the net of the inquiry, with Michael Sherwood, a senior Goldman Sachs banker and confidant, and the restauranteur Richard Caring, who owns the Ivy and was one of the original investors in BHS, now called as witnesses. Being knighted showed establishment approval for what Green felt he had achieved. \u201cStripping Green of his knighthood would for Lady Green be the most painful of all punishments, but it would be vindictive and inappropriate,\u201d says Myners. \u201cHe is entitled to have his arguments heard and dealt with in the same way we would respond if the person concerned was a simple Mr Green.\u201d \u2022 Comments will be opened later today THE GREEN FILE Born Croydon, 15 March 1952 Best of times Receiving a knighthood from the Tony Blair government for services to retail, sealing his membership of the business elite in 2006. \u201cI think it is a nice honour \u2013 to have made your mark,\u201d said Green at the time. Worst of times The collapse of BHS into administration has recast his public persona: no longer the \u201cking of the high street\u201d, he has been labelled the \u201cunacceptable face of capitalism\u201d. Having previously been celebrated for his business skills, the hundreds of millions of pounds his family banked from BHS are now being contrasted with the company\u2019s failure and the gaping hole in its pension scheme. What he says \u201cI was working as hard as I could and all these people beat me up. And you have all these people who can\u2019t even spell business or retail saying, \u2018Oh, we don\u2019t want people like him.\u2019 Snooty tooty people.\u201d What others say \u201cThe volcanoes erupt frequently. He\u2019s very sensitive but I think that for all people like Philip, insecurity is a factor, because in their minds they have got to continue to be successful\u2026There\u2019s a very childish side to Philip that looks for affection.\u201d Ian Grabiner, chief executive of Arcadia.",

But that\u2019s just what one anonymous bidder has done, paying almost $3.5m to break bread with Warren Buffett and the opportunity to glean some advice from one of the world\u2019s most successful businessmen. However, the $3,456,789 (\u00a32.42m) is not going to line the pockets of the Berkshire Hathaway chief, who is the world\u2019s third-richest person with a $66bn fortune, according to Forbes. Rather, it will help a San Francisco homeless charity called Glide. Rev Cecil Williams, one of Glide\u2019s co-founders, said: \u201cWe are astonished by the results of this year\u2019s auction and send heartfelt gratitude to Mr Buffett for his deep investment in unconditional love and community.\u201d It is the 15th year that the charity has auctioned a lunch with the Sage of Omaha, who has helped it to raise more than $20m. This year\u2019s winning bid equals the record set in 2012 and was more than $1m higher than the $2,345,678 paid last year by the boss of China\u2019s Dalian Zeus Entertainment. Zhu Ye, chief executive of the gaming company, called the chance to dine with Buffett a dream come true. The week-long auction was conducted on eBay and this year\u2019s prize also became the joint most expensive individual charity item sold on the site. Six of the past eight winners have paid more than $2m for lunch with Buffett. His late wife Susie was involved with Glide and Buffett has maintained the relationship following her death in 2004. Glide serves more than 850,000 meals a year, provides housing and health services as well as helping people to break out of poverty. Buffett said he was proud to be involved with an organisation that had helped so many people in need: \u201cGlide is a bridge for thousands of people on the brink of despair, helping them achieve dignity and opportunity by providing them with basic services.\u201d Homelessness has become a major issue in the northern Californian city in recent years.

      "bodyText": "When Janet Yellen sits down with her colleagues on the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate-setting committee this week, another slice of her credibility will be on the line. America\u2019s recovery since the financial crash has not followed the path it was supposed to. The central bank\u2019s constant dithering over whether to raise interest rates has made it appear weak and unable to influence events. In the seven years of what, in many economics textbooks, would be considered a strong recovery, the Fed has raised rates just once \u2013 by a quarter-percentage point to 0.5%, in December last year. More than eight million jobs have been created in the US since 2010, and the country\u2019s GDP is now well above its pre-crisis peak \u2013 having risen from $14.7 trillion in 2008 to $17.4tn in 2014. According to its critics, the Fed has set the bar for rate increases too high. Sure, they say, the path of growth has not always been smooth, and indeed the first three months of this year did constitute a weak spot. But, they also say, president Barack Obama\u2019s determination in the years immediately after 2008 to meet the crisis head on \u2013 with the most aggressive write-offs of banking sector bad loans in the developed world \u2013 set the US economy on a relentless upward trajectory that boosted confidence and investment. It will come as no surprise, though, should Yellen hold rates yet again on Tuesday. She will say that the generally strong headline growth figures disguise serious weaknesses in the US economy. The combination of turbulent financial markets and an uncertain outlook for the global economy as China slows and Europe contemplates the possible fallout from a Brexit vote, calls for cool heads, and a wait and see approach. Yellen\u2019s worries can be divided into five main categories. The US jobs market The most recent jobs figures appeared to show that employers felt confident about the future. Unemployment benefit claims were low, indicating that redundancies were being shelved in the expectation of more work. Job vacancies were also at a year high. That should be the green light for an interest rate rise. But other signals from the labour market have been flashing red. We learned recently that only a smattering of new jobs were added in May. This was such a shock that Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump tweeted: \u201cTerrible jobs report just reported. Only 38,000 jobs added. Bombshell!\u201d Economists had expected 160,000 new jobs. That 38,000 total was the weakest monthly rise since 2010. Sure, the unemployment rate fell to 4.7%, but this seemingly healthy figure reflects the large number of Americans who have dropped out of the jobs market. This has been one of the most marked trends of the past few years \u2013 along with the absence of meaningful wage rises. Last year the participation rate \u2013 which measures the proportion of people of working age making themselves available for employment \u2013 fell to almost 62%. That was the lowest level since 1977, which was an era of traditional households with a sole (usually male) earner. The rate began rising again late last year and has continued to strengthen in 2016, but remains disturbingly low. Wage rises have remained sluggish. Take April for instance: Americans\u2019 pay packets actually declined by 0.1% from the previous month, putting the annual gain at just 2.5%. But inflation in the month was a whopping 0.4% \u2013 pushing the annual inflation rate up to 1.1%, from 0.9%. That means that while wage growth in the US is only marginally higher than in the UK, the pay of Americans is being eaten up by an inflation rate almost four times the UK\u2019s 0.3%. US manufacturing Looking back, it is possible to see that much of the growth in US manufacturing after 2011 was tied to the shale gas boom. The world oil price was high and domestic frackers needed new equipment for drilling and to transport their cheap oil and gas. The collapse in the oil price from the summer of 2014 signalled the end of the boom. Many fracking business cut back production. Investment in new equipment came to an abrupt end. Recently, the oil price has clawed its way back from less than $27 a barrel to more than $50, which gave some in the industry a boost \u2013 though investment in new equipment is probably some way off. Chris Williamson, chief economist at financial data provider Markit, said the outlook for manufacturers was also being dampened by the uncertain political outlook, with many businesses wary about making major investments while a Trump presidency remains a possibility. \u201cUS manufacturing is going through its toughest period since the financial crisis,\u201d he said. \u201cThe decline of the energy sector, the strong dollar, weak global demand and growing concern about the presidential elections are all playing a part in restricting activity.\u201d He believes the strong dollar has restricted the ability of car manufacturers to sell abroad and, by making imported goods cheaper, has allowed US consumers to enjoy steady or falling prices \u2013 at the expense of domestic manufacturing jobs. China\u2019s slowdown Faced last year with a slowing global economy and a drop in demand for Chinese goods, Beijing relaxed its lending rules and allowed a borrowing splurge to boost growth. The outcome was a bumper March, then a disappointing April. May\u2019s figures could restore calm, but whatever the outcome, there is a bigger worry when it comes to China than yo-yoing economic data \u2013 and that is the source of its growth. A record surge in credit in the first quarter came after an already worrying longer-term rise in borrowing, especially in the property sector. Yellen would be unwise to dismiss concerns over an impending crash in China when President Xi Jinping himself has highlighted the risks of a growing debt mountain. For now in China, with car sales accelerating and imports showing signs of improvement, domestic demand appears to be picking up and supporting growth. This is part of the rebalancing that Beijing has been attempting to engineer, shifting the economy from heavily indebted state industries to the consumer. The concern is that the consumer will also assume the responsibility for taking on debt to keep the economy afloat. With the World Bank now anticipating that this year will be marked by the slowest global expansion since the financial crash, China will have to rely on domestic demand to secure Beijing\u2019s goal of growth at between 6.5% and 7% for the year. Some analysts believe China is heading for a day of reckoning; others put their faith in the powers of the Chinese leadership to write off debts. And if that proves unpalatable, it could exert firm control on the corporate sector and households alike, should things get sticky. Currency wars Much of President Obama\u2019s economic effort has been focused on building trade links between the US and the Pacific rim and China. One of his difficulties has been the rise in the value of the dollar since 2012 \u2013 when Europe plumbed the depths of crisis and Japan decided its only route to growth was a dirt-cheap currency that might spur exports. For a while, growth in global trade offset the higher price of US goods relative to its biggest competitors in Europe and Japan. Then, in 2014, the global economy began to run out of steam. Trade began to wane. Suddenly, highly priced US goods struggled to find a market. Beijing, which suffered an even bigger slowdown in manufacturing output, began doing things like dumping cheap steel on global markets \u2013 with dramatic effects in Britain, for one. The US also suffered. A rise in US interest rates would encourage international investors to buy US assets, and to do this they\u2019d need to exchange their own currency for dollars, increasing the demand for and price of the US currency. A higher dollar would only increase the gap with the euro and the yen and force the Chinese to devalue the yuan, further loosening its ties to the dollar. But when Beijing devalued last year, it set off a dramatic chain reaction throughout global stock and bond markets, with the result that Yellen found she had to delay a rate rise. Brexit The Federal Reserve has its own research unit, but it probably paid attention to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development\u2019s recent assertion that a British departure from the EU posed as big a threat to the global economy as a \u201chard landing\u201d in China. The Paris-based thinktank said Brexit would have significant costs not just for the UK and Europe, but for the rest of the world. Catherine Mann, OECD chief economist, said the uncertainty caused by the referendum had come as the global economy was caught in a low-growth trap. Its analysis predicted that by 2018 the eurozone economy would shrink by one percentage point. Growth for the OECD group of 34 rich countries would be reduced by just over half a point. The UK, which has been one of the few bright spots in the global recovery since 2014, would take an even bigger knock. It would be almost 1.5 percentage points smaller in 2018 after Brexit than if the country voted to stay in the EU on 23 June. Is this a world that could cope with the destabilising effects of higher borrowing costs in the US? It is to be hoped Yellen will judge it is not.",

Then, in 2014, the global economy began to run out of steam. Trade began to wane. Suddenly, highly priced US goods struggled to find a market. Beijing, which suffered an even bigger slowdown in manufacturing output, began doing things like dumping cheap steel on global markets \u2013 with dramatic effects in Britain, for one. The US also suffered.</p> <p>A rise in US interest rates would encourage international investors to buy US assets, and to do this they\u2019d need to exchange their own currency for dollars, increasing the demand for and price of the US currency. A higher dollar would only increase the gap with the euro and the yen and force the Chinese to devalue the yuan, further loosening its ties to the dollar.</p> <p>But when Beijing devalued last year, it set off a dramatic chain reaction throughout global stock and bond markets, with the result that Yellen found she had to delay a rate rise.</p> <h2><strong>Brexit</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4db049e90bc97647691ca3f4ec8eeab5ebc338a6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4db049e90bc97647691ca3f4ec8eeab5ebc338a6/0_140_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nigel Farage addresses the media during a poster launch\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Brexit worries are also US worries.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adrian Dennis/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Federal Reserve has its own research unit, but it probably paid attention to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/01/brexit-could-spread-shockwaves-trough-global-economy-says-oecd\" title=\"\">Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development\u2019s recent assertion that a British departure from the EU</a> posed as big a threat to the global economy as a \u201chard landing\u201d in China.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "After years of expectation, Amazon finally launched its Fresh grocery service in the UK last week, parking its tanks on the lawns of the country\u2019s biggest retailers. It promises \u201ceverything you need for your weekly shop\u201d, from artisanal Stilton to tangy cheese Doritos, delivered to your door in a cool box. Some analysts are predicting the US online giant could grab up to 3% of the UK grocery market by 2020. That would represent \u00a31.4bn of sales, much of which would be stolen from the already struggling traditional supermarkets \u2013 Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury\u2019s and Morrisons. \u201cI genuinely believe this is a game-changer,\u201d says grocery market analyst Bryan Roberts at TCC Global. Amazon has begun delivering to just 69 north and east London postcodes, but Roberts says its blueprint of same-day deliveries, access to high-quality local stores (such as Gail\u2019s Artisan Bakery, Daylesford Organic and chocolatier Paul A Young) combined with relatively low prices and Amazon\u2019s strong service record, could prove a \u201chuge draw\u201d. While 3% might sound like a tiny share of grocery sales, Amazon will be directly cutting into what has become one of the few growth avenues for traditional players, who are seeing shoppers gradually desert big supermarkets in favour of online and local shopping trips. The online grocery market is expected to nearly double in value to \u00a317.2bn between 2015 and 2020, according to food and grocery research body IGD, while supermarket and hypermarket sales will fall by nearly 3% to \u00a369.6bn. Pure online businesses Amazon and Ocado are expected to benefit the most from the change as the current market leader Tesco, which controls about 40% of the online grocery market, loses out. Amazon\u2019s service ambitions could also force the whole market to raise its game. That may be good news for shoppers, but is likely to put another dent in the profits of suffering supermarkets. Amazon is offering refunds as well as substitutions for items which are not in stock and a huge list of 130,000 products \u2013 something the main operators do not currently match. Ocado offers about 48,000 items, less than 40% of the range Amazon can boast, while Tesco has about 70,000. The average Asda or Sainsbury\u2019s superstore carries less than 40,000; Morrisons less than 22,000. Amazon\u2019s promise of same-day delivery is something only Ocado currently offers in certain cities, although Tesco and Asda have been trialling a same-day service for \u201cclick and collect\u201d orders. \u201cIt\u2019s very unhelpful and inconvenient for the mainstream players,\u201d says Neil Saunders of retail consultancy Conlumino. \u201cAmazon is very good at the service side of things and deliveries. It is going to make other players pull their services up when grocery online is already not very profitable, and profits are under pressure with price cuts.\u201d Its potential influence on service could be comparable to the impact of discounters Aldi and Lidl on prices. They now jointly hold about 10% of the UK market \u2013 less than 4 percentage points more than three years ago \u2013 yet in that time traditional supermarkets have been forced to slash prices to try to match the discounters on key items to prevent shoppers deserting them in droves. Profits have suffered accordingly. Saunders adds: \u201cIn a market where there is really no overall growth in volume, if anyone else comes in, even if they only take a small share, that will be coming off someone else.\u201d But Amazon should not look forward to an easy ride. In the US, where it has been offering its Fresh service for more than eight years, the company accounts for less than 1% of grocery spending, according to analysts Conlumino. Geographical expansion has been slow, with the service now available only in Seattle, San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York City, San Diego and Philadelphia. Expectations had been for it to be in 50 US cities by now. \u201cThis does not look to be a massive disruptive competitor in the short term,\u201d says Dave McCarthy, a well-regarded retail analyst at HSBC. \u201cIf Amazon is 50% the size of Ocado in five years it will have done well, but would still be well under 0.5% market share.\u201d One industry insider says Amazon may have an advantage from not playing by the same rules as its traditional rivals in terms of profit expectations and tax payments, but it will face six strong competitors. \u201cSelling short-life fresh foods is very different to books. It will burn a lot of money,\u201d the insider says. McCarthy argues that most shoppers are more interested in low prices than home delivery. Amazon has promised \u201ccompetitive\u201d prices: a basket of key items last week came in just below the prices of the big four. In the UK, many fresh food items \u2013 more than 2,400 products including pies and pizzas as well as fruit, vegetables and meat \u2013 will be supplied by Morrisons. That relationship will help Amazon offer a relatively cheaper range of products than in the US, although it will still be more pricey than Aldi and Lidl. Amazon will also have to be able to deliver on its service promises. Early reviews have pointed to multiple items being out of stock, and suggested its method of using coolboxes in ordinary vehicles rather than refrigerated vans may prove problematic in a heatwave - although Amazon said that the system has been shown to work well in hot weather in California. While same-day delivery may appeal to some, Amazon\u2019s deliveries will not be the cheapest. Those wishing to use Amazon Fresh must be signed up to Amazon Prime at a cost of \u00a379 a year, and then pay \u00a36.99 a month for unlimited deliveries of orders worth more than \u00a340. That would take the annual cost of getting the groceries to \u00a3162. That compares to a 12-month anytime delivery pass costing just \u00a360 a year at Sainsbury\u2019s and Tesco. As most online grocery shoppers choose to stick with the brand whose physical store they already visit, the prospect of a three-figure fee may be another hurdle in the way of changing habits. McCarthy\u2019s argument is supported by the fact that Amazon has been offering a range of groceries online for some years \u2013 from cleaning products to biscuits \u2013 without setting the market on fire. Analysts at Bernstein estimate those sales currently add up to about \u00a3300m. The new service gives additional convenience and the ability to do a full weekly shop, as it includes fresh produce, dairy and bakery goods not previously on offer, but it will mainly appeal to those already paying for Amazon Prime. One of its main benefits to Amazon may be to keep such customers locked into the company\u2019s growing \u201cecosystem\u201d \u2013 buying films, music and now groceries through the same route. Vanessa Henry at IGD says: \u201cAmazon has expanded through organic growth in the US and is present in densely populated urban areas, where demand is highest. We expect Amazon to follow a similar strategy in the UK in the short term, which means that its impact on existing players will be limited. Over time Amazon could make an impact, but we don\u2019t expect things to change overnight. For Amazon it will be more about driving loyalty and frequency of shop for its existing customers with the new service.\u201d If the service takes off, however, one of our smallest supermarket chains could be a beneficiary. Andy Higginson, the chairman of Morrisons, says he has no idea if Fresh will be successful but he hopes to benefit from being introduced to a new kind of shopper \u2013 particularly in London, where the Bradford-based chain has few stores. \u201cThey have proved very determined in other parts of their business,\u201d Higginson says. \u201cIf you are going to back any horse you would say Amazon is going to be a good one to put money on.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "George Osborne\u2019s critics sense that his reputation as a master tactician is unravelling. His \u201comnishambles\u201d budget of 2012 was a clue to the limits of his powers. More recently, he entered the battlefield in the EU referendum with all guns blazing, only to run out of ammunition weeks before the vote. Analysts were bemused that the chancellor and the prime minister had fired all their shots before most people had woken up to the fact that a referendum was even taking place. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development waded back into the debate earlier this month to remind voters that its calculations, and those of all economic forecasters, were that Britain would suffer badly from leaving the EU. Angel Gurr\u00eda, the Paris-based organisation\u2019s boss, repeated the warning last week, though he had nothing new to say. On Thursday the chancellor has the opportunity to resurrect the Remain camp\u2019s faltering campaign to keep Britain in Europe when he takes the podium at the Mansion House to make his annual speech to City grandees. Without any extra cards to play, he will attempt to demolish Boris Johnson\u2019s claim that money used to fund the EU can be diverted to the NHS and other vital public services. He will repeat the Treasury\u2019s own calculations that households could lose \u00a34,300 on average by 2030 from a cut in the UK\u2019s likely growth rate of 6%. \u201cThe conclusion is clear for Britain\u2019s economy and for families \u2013 leaving the EU would be the most extraordinary self-inflicted wound,\u201d he has said. Only he will need to go further. Taking the forecast from the Institute for Fiscal Studies that Brexit could generate a \u00a340bn black hole in the government\u2019s finances, he will tell the massed ranks of City executives that the impact of such a shortfall will be disastrous for the NHS. How, he will ask, when he has already cut all other services to the bone, can the ringfenced NHS and schools budgets now survive intact? It will be Project Fear writ large. But that is essentially a message for wavering Labour voters, fearful that a vital public service will be threatened by a Brexit vote. City bankers, on the other hand, will probably be more interested to hear the night\u2019s other speaker, the Bank of England governor Mark Carney. He is a staunch supporter of the chancellor\u2019s anti-Brexit campaign on the basis that the Bank\u2019s research shows it will undermine the UK\u2019s recovery. Worse, the immediate aftermath of a Brexit vote will test the bank\u2019s powers to keep the financial system from going into meltdown. Carney has secured a reputation as much the most trusted among the custodians of the UK\u2019s financial system. Purdah rules will prevent him from saying more on the subject before the vote, but Osborne will want to project an image of the governor standing next to him both physically and in the fight against a Leave vote that would launch a voyage into the unknown. There are plenty of hedge-fund managers and private-equity investors, most of them based in London\u2019s Mayfair, that welcome any chance to cut regulations and bureaucratic red tape. They see Brussels as out of tune with their concerns relative to the more accommodating UK Treasury. It is this group Osborne will be under pressure to address. Unfortunately, he can\u2019t threaten that a post-Brexit Treasury would be no more compliant than it is now \u2013 because he almost certainly would no longer be chancellor.",

      "bodyText": "John McDonnell has joined calls for former BHS boss Sir Philip Green to be stripped of his knighthood if he refuses to be grilled by MPs next week. The shadow chancellor has added his voice to the mounting antipathy in Westminster towards the retail billionaire, claiming that abolishing Green\u2019s knighthood would be one way to \u201chelp restore public faith in the honours system\u201d. Green has been asked by MP Frank Field to appear before the work and pensions committee this Wednesday as part of its inquiry into the collapse of BHS, which has led to the loss of around 11,000 jobs. Rather than accept the committee\u2019s request, Green\u2019s response has been to demand Field resigns as chairman of the committee. He has previously stated that he was \u201cnot prepared to participate\u201d. McDonnell, writing in the Observer on Sunday, says that such a snub is an affront to the electorate as well as parliament and that the Arcadia chief, who has been repeatedly blamed for the collapse of the department store, should be suitably punished. \u201cThis week, we may witness Philip Green (I refuse to use his title) justify his actions at BHS,\u201d he says. \u201cThe fact he feels he can threaten to subvert parliament is an insult to the British public. If he refuses to come before parliament, Green should be stripped of his knighthood.\u201d McDonnell adds: \u201cParliament should have the right to strip honours from individuals, in my view. This would remove the secret committee network and help restore public faith in the honours system.\u201d The shadow chancellor goes on to maul Green\u2019s business decisions while at the helm of BHS over 15 years, referring to how he removed large sums from the company while leaving the pension fund in deficit before finally selling the company to Dominic Chappell, a three-time bankrupt. Last week Field\u2019s committee heard Chappell described as a \u201cmythomaniac\u201d and a \u201cPremier League liar\u201d. McDonnell states: \u201cIt was another act of vandalism that makes a mockery of those in business who are doing the right thing. And \u2013 even worse \u2013 employees of BHS will be paying for this with their pensions.\u201d However, Green appears unmoved by the fury, claiming Field is biased and orchestrated a \u201ctrial by media\u201d designed to \u201cdestroy my reputation\u201d. The 64-year-old retailer has also alleged that the outcome of the inquiry was \u201cpre-determined\u201d. In turn, Field appears insistent on ensuring Green appears before his committee, stating: \u201cThe House of Commons decides who chairs these committees, not Sir Philip Green. It\u2019s in his interest to turn up.\u201d The committee chair has considerable support from peers, with SNP MP Angus MacNeil tweeting: Business minister, Anna Soubry, tweeted: Administrators announced last week that the business would be wound down and all 163 shops closed and sold off after it failed to find a buyer for the bankrupt department store. It brought to an end an 88-year trading history after intensive efforts to save the business came to nothing. The Insolvency Service has launched an inquiry that could result in former BHS bosses facing boardroom bans. The Pensions Regulator is also investigating the \u00a3571m pensions black hole left by BHS and will publish its findings. Field has also indicated he wants Green to put \u00a3600m into the retailer\u2019s beleaguered pension scheme. A group of Conservative MPs are reportedly already planning to write to the honours forfeiture committee, which must then formally evaluate the tycoon\u2019s knighthood before advising the Queen on what action to take.",

      "bodyText": "The chair of the work and pensions select committee has rejected a call to resign from Sir Philip Green, the owner of Topshop, who accused the MP of attempting to destroy his reputation over the controversial sale of BHS. Green claimed Frank Field\u2019s parliamentary investigation into the collapse of the department store chain was biased and suggested he would not give evidence to MPs on Wednesday unless Field stepped down. In a letter to Field, Green wrote that the Labour MP\u2019s continued participation in the inquiry would only \u201cobstruct a resolution\u201d. The Topshop tycoon has come under fire over the sale of now-defunct BHS for \u00a31 last year. \u201cI am not prepared to participate in a process which has not even the pretence of fairness and objectivity and which has as its primary objective the destruction of my reputation,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI therefore require you to resign immediately from this inquiry.\u201d Field said it was in Green\u2019s interest to attend the joint session of the work and pensions and business committees next week. The chain collapsed into administration last month, leaving a \u00a3571m deficit in its pension scheme that must now be covered by a government lifeboat scheme. Field said on Saturday: \u201cWe appreciate that Sir Philip is trying to set up a deal for the pension fund, but \u00a3600m is the size of the deficit. That\u2019s not jumping to any conclusion, that is a fact. We very much look forward to hearing his side of the story on Wednesday.\u201d He told the BBC it was the House of Commons that \u201cdecides who chairs these committees, not Sir Philip Green\u201d. Meanwhile, the business select committee chair, Iain Wright, said Green risked appearing to have \u201csomething to hide\u201d if he did not attend Wednesday\u2019s hearing. \u201cSir Philip Green has a lot of questions to answer about the sale of BHS, the BHS pension fund and his stewardship of BHS,\u201d the MP said. \u201cI\u2019m sure he won\u2019t want the accusation thrown at him that he has something to hide, that he\u2019s running scared and that he\u2019s looking for excuses not to appear.\u201d Pressure has been mounting on the Arcadia owner, whose purchase of BHS in 2000 helped make him a billionaire, following the chain\u2019s collapse into administration last month. Green sold BHS to ex-racing driver Dominic Chappell, who was formerly bankrupt and had no retail experience. Several MPs have called for Green to be stripped of his knighthood if he does not help to cover the huge pension deficit. About 20,000 current and former BHS workers are members of the scheme. Anna Soubry, business minister, tweeted: Jim McMahon, a Labour MP, has written to David Cameron asking him to consider stripping Green of his honour, while a group of Conservative MPs are writing to the honours forfeiture committee, according to Westminster sources. The committee will then have to formally consider the tycoon\u2019s knighthood and advise the Queen on what action to take. The collapse of BHS could cost the taxpayer up to \u00a336m, it has emerged, while Tina Green, the billionaire\u2019s wife, reaped a \u00a353m windfall from the sale of the BHS headquarters in central London to Arcadia. Green also wrote in his letter to Field: \u201cWithout even waiting for next week\u2019s oral evidence session, you have used your position as chair of the work and pensions committee to do your very best to destroy my reputation. Your bias against me and lack of any interest in a fair process are demonstrated clearly by \u2026 statements published this evening.\u201d The tycoon was referring to comments Field made to the Financial Times in which he intimated that Green would need to cover the pension fund deficit in full. Field told the newspaper: \u201cThe evidence we have been hearing about the BHS sale has been very worrying and disconcerting. The committee may have considered a reasonable settlement in the very early days of our inquiry, but things have changed. Sir Philip needs to convince us that he\u2019s come up with the very best deal for those pensioners.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The solar power industry says it has seen the loss of more than half its 35,000 jobs due to recent changes in government energy policy, just at a time when solar power has eclipsed coal as a major generator of Britain\u2019s electricity. Experts believe ministers had cut subsidies too far and too fast, praising the \u201cseismic\u201d, record-breaking growth of solar in recent years. This month the Solar Cloth Company became the latest to be put into administration, following the liquidation and 170 job losses at Solarlec two weeks ago. The biggest single collapse was late last year when the Mark Group went into administration with almost 1,000 redundancies. The Solar Trade Association (STA), which represents the industry, said it was collecting exact statistics to be published soon but experts believe up to 18,000 jobs have gone in less than 12 months. Jonathan Selwyn, chairman of the STA, said companies had been \u201cvery hard hit\u201d and many were trying to change their business models or concentrate on overseas markets. He contrasted ministers\u2019 enthusiasm for slashing subsidies for solar with their professed concern for other struggling industrial sectors such as steelmaking. \u201cThis [solar] must be the only industrial sector where the government is congratulating itself for causing thousands of job losses,\u201d he said. But the government said it had a duty to balance jobs with household bills. \u201cOur priority is to keep energy bills as low as possible for families and businesses whilst supporting low-carbon technologies that represent value for money,\u201d said a spokesman for the Department of Energy and Climate Change. \u201cThe cost of solar has steadily declined over the last 10 years and it is right that as this comes down so should the consumer-funded support,\u201d he added. Michael Grubb, professor of international energy and climate change policy at University College London, said it was too soon to say whether the solar sector would settle into slower growth or drop away completely. \u201cSolar has benefited from extraordinarily generous subsidies and no one \u2013 including me \u2013 expected to see such incredible growth rates. It has been quite seismic for a country that was getting a smidgen of power from renewables only a few years ago. But the cutbacks [in subsidies] have been dramatic and quick.\u201d The new importance of solar has been underlined by recent research by analysts at Carbon Brief showing solar panels produced more electricity than coal in May. Deployment of renewable energy is moving even faster on the continent, with Portugal running its entire electricity network for four days in May entirely on solar, wind and hydropower. The increasing use of these technologies across the world was one of the reasons the oil group BP, in its annual statistical review published on Wednesday, reported global CO2 emissions showed no growth in 2015 for the first time in 10 years. Britain has in recent years installed up to 10 gigawatts of solar power \u2013 enough to power more than 3m homes, or 65% of the power promised from the planned new reactors at the Hinkley Point C nuclear plant. Photovoltaic panels on household roofs and in larger industrial arrays produced 1,336 gigawatt hours (GWh) last month compared with 893 GWh from coal, which is being burned less and less as old plants such as Ferrybridge in Yorkshire and Longannet in Scotland are retired. Amber Rudd, the energy and climate change secretary, has promised to close all coal-fired power stations by 2025 as part of a plan to reduce carbon emissions and tackle global warming. Scottish Power, the owner of Longannet, once owned half a dozen coal-fired power stations but is now dependent on gas and wind farms for generating electricity. It has six new onshore windfarms under construction. Wind has been at the forefront of the low-carbon revolution in Britain, but the government has also removed all subsidies from onshore turbines saying developers no longer need financial incentives. There is already 8.8GW of wind power onshore and another 5.1GW offshore, according to the lobby group Renewables UK. Ministers are committed to helping windfarms out at sea which have received much less opposition from residents but are much more expensive to develop. Growing investor enthusiasm for low-carbon energy in the aftermath of commitments made at the Paris climate change talks were underlined this week with the \u00a310bn flotation of Dong Energy. The Danish company has already spent \u00a36bn on UK wind farms such as the London Array project and plans to inject a further \u00a36bn by 2020 on projects such as Hornsea 1 off the coast of Yorkshire. Dong is an energy company that is in transition from an oil and gas producer to leading wind power developer. The larger pure oil companies such as Total of France, Shell and Statoil have also started to invest recently in low-carbon activities. They are under pressure from some of their own shareholders but are also aware that tougher regulations on carbon emissions must be on their way if governments are to tackle global warming and meet their climate change commitments. Total has just spent $1bn (\u00a3700m) buying a battery storage business, Saft, that could play a key role in beating the problem of intermittency in electricity generated by solar and wind power. Shell has just established a new energies division, though it admits the scale of investment will be small at first, while Norway\u2019s Statoil has just been granted a seabed lease that will allow it to build the world\u2019s largest floating windfarm, Hywind, off the coast of Scotland. Critics question whether the newfound interest in renewables by traditional oil companies is genuine or just an attempt to take the heat off themselves as they come under increasing fire from environmentalists who accuse them of stoking climate change. \u2022 This article was amended on 11 June 2016 to clarify the sourcing for the figure of 18,000 jobs.",

A middle-aged man in a neat blue dress shirt, cellphone clipped to his belt is in the back of the shop, talking to one of the employees who carves custom candles for spells. He needs luck, he explains, to close a business deal. The deal could fall apart even after a contract is signed, so the spell had to last, he carefully explains. </p> <p>As the employee \u2013 perched on a stool under a sign that reads \u201cThe Witch Is In\u201d \u2013 starts to carve intricate symbols into a huge pillar candle for the businessman, shop owner Stacy Rapp, enters in a whirlwind. A slender energetic woman, her arms and chest covered in intricate tattoos of pentagrams to ravens and her vibrant pink hair covered in a black bandanna, she seems incapable of standing still for more than a few minutes. Her arms are full of plants for the shop\u2019s back garden, where ritual sabbaths, open to the community, are held eight times a year.<br></p> <p>After 34 years in business in the East Village, with the recession and the rising rents of gentrification claiming so many small businesses, Enchantments\u2019 survival might make anyone believe in magic. The carved candles are the shop\u2019s specialty and bestselling item, but the shop also offers a fully stocked apothecary with everything from mugwort to rosehips, an entire binder of custom oils and incense and a large selection of books. Behind a glass case in front of the cash register are a variety of tarot cards and silver occult jewelry, a shelf of statuettes of gods and goddesses of every ilk adorns one side of the shop and behind the front door, a small altar is tucked out of the way of customers\u2019 feet.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f07f253c1a9d4ace3acdb1b6bbfd8bec738a7abf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f07f253c1a9d4ace3acdb1b6bbfd8bec738a7abf/0_22_4928_2958/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Enchantments occult shop in New York Carmen Pouerie carving candles.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Carmen Pouerie carves candles at Enchantments occult shop in New York.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Simon Leigh for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The shop does not perform spells, Rapp tells me, after leading me to a quiet backroom away from the heady smell of the incense. The shop provides supplies that people use to perform a spell. Enchantments strictly sells supplies for good magic, Rapp explains, which is one reason to which she attributes its continuing success. The shop puts out positive energy, so positive energy comes back to it, she explains.

      "bodyText": "Enchantments, the oldest witchcraft store in New York, has not been open for an hour but already it\u2019s buzzing. A middle-aged man in a neat blue dress shirt, cellphone clipped to his belt is in the back of the shop, talking to one of the employees who carves custom candles for spells. He needs luck, he explains, to close a business deal. The deal could fall apart even after a contract is signed, so the spell had to last, he carefully explains. As the employee \u2013 perched on a stool under a sign that reads \u201cThe Witch Is In\u201d \u2013 starts to carve intricate symbols into a huge pillar candle for the businessman, shop owner Stacy Rapp, enters in a whirlwind. A slender energetic woman, her arms and chest covered in intricate tattoos of pentagrams to ravens and her vibrant pink hair covered in a black bandanna, she seems incapable of standing still for more than a few minutes. Her arms are full of plants for the shop\u2019s back garden, where ritual sabbaths, open to the community, are held eight times a year. After 34 years in business in the East Village, with the recession and the rising rents of gentrification claiming so many small businesses, Enchantments\u2019 survival might make anyone believe in magic. The carved candles are the shop\u2019s specialty and bestselling item, but the shop also offers a fully stocked apothecary with everything from mugwort to rosehips, an entire binder of custom oils and incense and a large selection of books. Behind a glass case in front of the cash register are a variety of tarot cards and silver occult jewelry, a shelf of statuettes of gods and goddesses of every ilk adorns one side of the shop and behind the front door, a small altar is tucked out of the way of customers\u2019 feet. The shop does not perform spells, Rapp tells me, after leading me to a quiet backroom away from the heady smell of the incense. The shop provides supplies that people use to perform a spell. Enchantments strictly sells supplies for good magic, Rapp explains, which is one reason to which she attributes its continuing success. The shop puts out positive energy, so positive energy comes back to it, she explains.
