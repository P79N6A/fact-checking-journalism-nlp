      "bodyText": "Britain's booming housing market could be heading for a fresh crash, the Bank of England said in its toughest warning yet about the dangers of the return of rapidly rising property prices. Sir Jon Cunliffe, Threadneedle Street's deputy governor for financial stability, said it would be dangerous to ignore the momentum apparent across the country and dropped strong hints of new measures to slow down the market in the months ahead. On a day when it emerged that one in 15 London homes are now selling for \u00a31m or more, Cunliffe said Britain had a history of booms turning to bust. \"This is a movie that has been seen more than once in the UK.\" The Bank's deputy governor said that there were always risks to financial stability \"blinking on the dashboard\" but made clear his concern about the possibility that borrowers taking on large mortgages could find themselves in trouble when interest rates inevitably rose. \"The growing momentum in the market is now in my view the brightest light on that dashboard\", Cunliffe said. \"It has not yet been accompanied by a substantial increase in aggregate mortgage debt, though gross mortgage lending is growing and there are signs that debts are becoming more concentrated.\" Cunliffe said the housing market could have a \"soft landing\" as houses became less affordable and lenders tightened up the conditions for granting homes loans. \"But other outcomes are very possible and the financial policy committee [FPC] will need be both vigilant and ready to act.\" He said the risk was of \"a major overshoot in prices and buildup in debt followed by a sharp correction with negative equity and an overhang of debt for many households\", adding: \"Unfortunately, there are more precedents in UK for periods of a rapidly growing housing market to end in this way.\" The FPC was set up by George Osborne with a view to preventing the economy being destabilised by the sort of asset price bubbles that emerged before the crash of 2007-08. Cunliffe said the decision about what to do about the growing momentum would be its top priority in the months ahead. Figures from the Nationwide building society showed annual house price inflation at a seven-year high of 10.9%. Cunliffe said: \"There is good reason to believe that a ... combination of strong demand, weak supply and expectations of a rising market could lead to a period of sustained and very powerful pressure on house prices in the UK.\" Earlier this week, Threadneedle Street announced stringent stress tests designed to ensure that lenders could absorb a 35% drop in house prices, a fall that would be unprecedented in the UK. Cunliffe said the Bank was worried that more and more people were getting into debt that could pose a risk to the economy's year-long recovery. \"Given their sensitivity to a change in economic conditions, a long tail of highly indebted households could represent a vulnerability for both the banks and the economy. The data suggest that the size of this tail is increasing.\" Nationwide said its analysis of Land Registry data showed that in London the proportion of sales involving homes costing more than \u00a3500,000 had leaped from 13% in 2007 to around 25% in 2013. For properties costing more than \u00a31m, the figure has more than doubled from 3% to 6.5% over the same period. The building society's latest house price index showed the average house price in the UK is now \u00a3183,577. The monthly rate of growth has picked up, with a rise of 1.2% following March's 0.5% increase. \"Earnings growth is beginning to pick up, with wage increases finally outpacing the rise in the cost of living in February,\" said Nationwide's chief economist, Robert Gardner. \"Nevertheless, house price growth is outstripping income growth by a wide margin.The risk is that unless supply accelerates significantly, affordability will become stretched.\" Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight, said it was \"certainly justifiable to talk of a house price bubble in London\". Prices in the capital are up 18% on a year ago, with some areas up more than 30%. However, he added: \"The strength of house prices is not yet a serious problem outside of the capital, and housing market activity is still not unduly strong compared to long-term norms, so in these respects it is premature to talk of a general housing market bubble.\"",

    "webTitle": "Sir Winston Churchill's grandson asks Serco shareholders for \u00a3170m", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Rupert Soames was in typically ebullient mood yesterday as he told City analysts: \"I'm sitting here with my satchel, my protractor set, and a large pink eraser on my first day at school.\" But the lighthearted style of the grandson of Sir Winston Churchill could not hide the seriousness of the task ahead as Soames started his first working day at Serco. The new boss of the vast outsourcing company \u2013 which is still dogged by last year's revelations that it billed the government for electronically tagging prisoners who were dead \u2013 had just revealed he is going cap in hand to shareholders for an emergency \u00a3170m to keep the company's bankers off his back. The cash pile is needed to give Soames, whose operations range from running the Docklands Light Railway to immigration services in Australia, \"space and air cover\" from the group's lenders while he embarks on a nine-month review of almost 1,000 contracts in 30 different countries. Without it the business will be \"uncomfortably close\" to breaching the borrowing terms stipulated by its lenders. Soames had applied for a job at Serco in 2002 but was turned away. Instead he went to Aggreko, a company which provides mobile power generation plant. In his 11 years at the helm it soared up the stock market rankings into the FTSE-100, rising in value almost tenfold to \u00a34.5bn. This time when Serco needed a new boss, the company turned to him. While Soames now has the top job in a business that employs 120,000 workers, it faces a battle for its future and is suffering a rapidly shrinking stock market value \u2013 currently \u00a31.6bn as a result of the shares crashing from last summer's 10-year high of 683p to 340p. Last month the company said its debt had increased by 21% to \u00a3700m. This week it admitted this will now reach \u00a3800m by the end of this year as a result of shrinking cash flows caused by the loss of the contract for tagging prisoners, a fall in contract volumes from the Australian immigration service and rising costs on other contracts. Even after the \u00a3170m share placing \u2013 the most that Serco could raise under stock market convention without a full-blown rights issue \u2013 some analysts questioned whether it would be enough. \"We are not convinced that this will be sufficient given the downward spiral the company seems to be in,\" said analysts at Cantor Fitzgerald. Soames described the fundraising as pragmatic and necessary \"to give us the headroom to get through a strategy review \u2026 without being under the cosh of our lenders\". Thursday's early morning call with analysts followed two unscheduled, late night announcements by the company in just 48 hours. On Monday it issued a profits warning and revealed the need to tap shareholders for cash. On Wednesday night it put a size on the fundraising, \u00a3170m, and a figure on the scale of profit fall \u2013 perhaps as much as \u00a380m \u2013 in an announcement that also included the resignation of the finance director, Andrew Jenner. Soames admitted yesterday that morale at the company was \"not as good as it should be\" as a result of an overhaul of the business which began in the wake of the tagging scandal and subsequent departure of the group's long-standing chief executive Chris Hyman in October. The decision to split the UK and European arms, with one section to focus on the \"UK government customers\" and the other on activities in the wider public sector, has led to a duplication in costs and had an impact on staff. \"There is no denying that the events of the past year have been very traumatic for the business,\" Soames said. \"One of my first and more urgent tasks is to help rebuild the management team.\" Soames is replacing the temporary boss Ed Casey, who was parachuted in from the US operations following Hyman's departure. Casey, however, is to stay on as chief operating officer and Soames quipped he had \"got over the shock of meeting me and had not yet been physically sick\". The strategy review, he said, will look at every aspect of the business. \"I'm conscious nine months might seem like a long time but this a large and complex business.\" One of the key measures he will look at is the amount of profit being generated from the working capital employed. He will also be focusing on profit margins, because Serco is winning fewer highly profitable contracts. Asked about his three priorities, he will not answer. But he likened the events of last year \u2013 and the opportunities they might provide \u2013 as similar to those faced by Exxon after the Valdez oil spill 25 years ago. \"Exxon had a tanker called Valdez \u2013 they had owned about 100 tankers and only one went off the rocks,\" he said, but Exxon had reacted and now had an outstanding safety record. Serco, he said, had an opportunity to show it \"learnt the lessons\" of its past, high-profile mistakes. Born to lead? Rupert Soames can just remember his grandfather, Sir Winston Churchill. His earliest memories are of playing cowboys and Indians with Britain's wartime prime minister \u2013 and of not being allowed to attend his state funeral. He was six at the time and furious: \"Watching it on TV was a very poor substitute,\" he once said. His family has long been part of the political establishment: his father Christopher was the last governor of southern Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe, who served in Margaret Thatcher's cabinet and was also a European commissioner, while his brother Nicholas is a current Tory MP. Educated at Eton and Oxford, where he graduated with a third, Soames showed an enterprising streak as a student, travelling from Oxford to London twice a week in his final year to run disco nights at Annabel's nightclub in Mayfair \u2013 a talent he also put to use when he DJ-ed at the wedding of Charles and Diana. Soames says he liked being in charge from an early age \u2013 hence his preference for being on the turntables at a party, making people dance faster or slower, he says. After Oxford, he joined GEC, then the largest private sector employer in the UK, where he stayed for 15 years working for the company's empire-building boss, Arnie Weinstock. Following a stint at software firm Misys (which he left after disagreeing with its founder Kevin Lomax about the firm's strategy), he landed the Aggreko job after its boss, Philip Harrower, was killed in Louisiana in a car crash. Under Soames's stewardship, the supplier of temporary generators whose customers range from offshore oil platforms to such events as the London Olympics, expanded rapidly and made it into the FTSE 100. The company also supplies the Glastonbury festival, which Soames attends every year. The 54-year-old is married with three children and lives on a farm in Buckinghamshire.",

      "body": "<p>Rupert Soames was in typically ebullient mood yesterday as he told City analysts: \"I'm sitting here with my satchel, my protractor set, and a large pink eraser on my first day at school.\"</p> <p>But the lighthearted style of the grandson of Sir Winston Churchill could not hide the seriousness of the task ahead as Soames started his first working day at Serco.</p> <p>The new boss of the vast outsourcing company \u2013 which is still dogged by last year's revelations that it billed the government for electronically tagging prisoners who were dead \u2013 had just revealed he is going cap in hand to shareholders for an emergency \u00a3170m to keep the company's bankers off his back.</p> <p>The cash pile is needed to give Soames, whose operations range from running the Docklands Light Railway to immigration services in Australia, \"space and air cover\" from the group's lenders while he embarks on a nine-month review of almost 1,000 contracts in 30 different countries. Without it the business will be \"uncomfortably close\" to breaching the borrowing terms stipulated by its lenders.</p> <p>Soames had applied for a job at Serco in 2002 but was turned away. Instead he went to Aggreko, a company which provides mobile power generation plant. In his 11 years at the helm it soared up the stock market rankings into the FTSE-100, rising in value almost tenfold to \u00a34.5bn.</p> <p>This time when Serco needed a new boss, the company turned to him. While Soames now has the top job in a business that employs 120,000 workers, it faces a battle for its future and is suffering a rapidly shrinking stock market value \u2013 currently \u00a31.6bn as a result of the shares crashing from last summer's 10-year high of 683p to 340p.</p> <p>Last month the company said its debt had increased by 21% to \u00a3700m. This week it admitted this will now reach \u00a3800m by the end of this year as a result of shrinking cash flows caused by the loss of the contract for tagging prisoners, a fall in contract volumes from the Australian immigration service and rising costs on other contracts.</p> <p>Even after the \u00a3170m share placing \u2013 the most that Serco could raise under stock market convention without a full-blown rights issue \u2013 some analysts questioned whether it would be enough.</p> <p>\"We are not convinced that this will be sufficient given the downward spiral the company seems to be in,\" said analysts at Cantor Fitzgerald.</p> <p>Soames described the fundraising as pragmatic and necessary \"to give us the headroom to get through a strategy review \u2026 without being under the cosh of our lenders\".</p> <p>Thursday's early morning call with analysts followed two unscheduled, late night announcements by the company in just 48 hours. On Monday it issued a profits warning and revealed the need to tap shareholders for cash. On Wednesday night it put a size on the fundraising, \u00a3170m, and a figure on the scale of profit fall \u2013 perhaps as much as \u00a380m \u2013 in an announcement that also included the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/apr/30/serco-finance-director-andrew-jenner\" title=\"\">resignation of the finance director, Andrew Jenner</a>.</p> <p>Soames admitted yesterday that morale at the company was \"not as good as it should be\" as a result of an overhaul of the business which began in the wake of the tagging scandal and subsequent departure of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/oct/25/serco-chief-quits-government-contracts-chris-hyman\" title=\"\">the group's long-standing chief executive Chris Hyman in October</a>.</p> <p>The decision to split the UK and European arms, with one section to focus on the \"UK government customers\" and the other on activities in the wider public sector, has led to a duplication in costs and had an impact on staff. \"There is no denying that the events of the past year have been very traumatic for the business,\" Soames said. \"One of my first and more urgent tasks is to help rebuild the management team.\"</p> <p>Soames is replacing the temporary boss Ed Casey, who was parachuted in from the US operations following Hyman's departure. Casey, however, is to stay on as chief operating officer and Soames quipped he had \"got over the shock of meeting me and had not yet been physically sick\".</p> <p>The strategy review, he said, will look at every aspect of the business. \"I'm conscious nine months might seem like a long time but this a large and complex business.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/ni/1398959309666/Serco_Share_Price_020514_WE.svg\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/ni/1398959309666/Serco_Share_Price_020514_WE.svg\"style=\"width:100%;\"> </figure>  <p>One of the key measures he will look at is the amount of profit being generated from the working capital employed. He will also be focusing on profit margins, because Serco is winning fewer highly profitable contracts.</p> <p>Asked about his three priorities, he will not answer.</p> <p>But he likened the events of last year \u2013 and the opportunities they might provide \u2013 as similar to those faced by Exxon after the Valdez oil spill 25 years ago.</p> <p>\"Exxon had a tanker called Valdez \u2013 they had owned about 100 tankers and only one went off the rocks,\" he said, but Exxon had reacted and now had an outstanding safety record.

      "bodyText": "Speculation is growing that Pfizer, the maker of Viagra, is preparing to raise its takeover offer for AstraZeneca, Britain's second-largest drugmaker, to more than \u00a363bn. In a move that will ramp up the pressure on AstraZeneca, the New York-based pharmaceuticals company is poised to come back with a new offer, after its cash-and-shares bid of \u00a346.61 a share, valuing AstraZeneca at \u00a358.8bn, was rebuffed. The proposed deal \u2013 already the biggest foreign takeover bid in UK corporate history \u2013 is also facing mounting opposition, with critics saying it would deal a savage blow to the UK's prominent science sector. On Thursday night Lord Sainsbury, the former science minister and an influential voice in British business, urged the UK government to publicly oppose any takeover bid from Pfizer. \"It is clear to me that this proposed takeover is going to deal a devastating blow to our profile in the pharmaceuticals area, which I think is going to be critical in the next 30 years,\" he told the Financial Times. He described the deal as undesirable and said it could cause long-term damage to Britain, given Pfizer's track record of cutting jobs and stripping assets. He urged the government to \"give real leadership and say we don't want something like this to happen\". Bloomberg reported that a new bid could value AstraZeneca at more than \u00a350 a share, that it could include a larger cash component, and that it might be tabled as soon as next week. City analysts have predicted that the offer could even be raised to the mid-\u00a350 level, which would value AstraZeneca at up to \u00a370bn. AstraZeneca shares ended the day 3.2% higher at \u00a348.15, the highest close since Pfizer's approach was first reported a week and a half ago. Such an improved offer would address some of the concerns raised by shareholders and the AstraZeneca board. While stressing the board's confidence in the Anglo-Swedish firm's future as an independent company, chairman Leif Johansson has effectively laid out the conditions under which AstraZeneca would be prepared to negotiate. In a video message posted on the company's website, he said the board rejected Pfizer's approach because it \"very significantly undervalued\" AstraZeneca and its prospects. It also has concerns about the large proportion of Pfizer shares in the deal and the proposed tax structure of the combined company. Under Pfizer's plan, the merged group would be incorporated in the UK, to protect it from the 38% rate of corporation tax in the US and take advantage of the lower UK corporation tax rate of 21%, dropping to 20% next year. The world's largest drug company is also keen to acquire AstraZeneca's promising pipeline of new cancer treatments \u2013 a new generation of drugs that use the body's immune system to fight tumours. Pfizer's Scottish-born boss, Ian Read, has returned to the US after a busy 48-hour visit to London, where he met most of AstraZeneca's major shareholders and senior political figures including chancellor George Osborne, the universities and science minister David Willetts and Sir Jeremy Heywood, the cabinet secretary. He also had phone calls with Vince Cable, the business secretary, and others. While AstraZeneca has until now refused to enter negotiations with Pfizer, some of its main shareholders have indicated that they would support a deal if Pfizer \u2013 which has grown through acquisition \u2013 improves its offer. Pfizer's approach has raised fears of thousands of job cuts in Britain. The US company's closure of the bulk of its research centre at Sandwich in Kent, where Viagra was developed, is still fresh in many memories. It led to 1,500 job losses. Pfizer kept 700 scientists in Sandwich, who develop cancer and other medicines, as well as 160 researchers in Cambridge working on pain, sensory and regenerative treatments, and 300 people at a packaging site in Havant near Portsmouth. AstraZeneca employs about 6,700 people in the UK out of 50,000 worldwide and plans to move its headquarters to Cambridge from London by 2016. Analysts at Credit Suisse have said: \"The strategic logic and financial uncertainty around AstraZeneca's ability to deliver on its strategy alone make a deal more than likely.\" Elsewhere, the FTSE 100 drugmaker Shire, which is known for its attention-deficit/hyperactivity drugs and has been touted as a potential bid target for Botox maker Allergan \u2013 or even AstraZeneca, as part of its defence strategy \u2013 underlined its appeal when it reported strong first-quarter results and upgraded its forecast for earnings per share to \"mid-to-high 20%\" growth. Talking about the \"merger frenzy\" in the industry, chief executive Flemming Ornskov said he was choosing to focus on growth, innovation and profitability. \"That's what I can control and will continue to focus on,\" he said.",

A Serco that looks more Capita sounds like an improvement. In the meantime, predictability in earnings has gone out of the window at Serco. The company confesses to more problems in more contracts every time it speaks.

Capita didn't rush abroad to preach the outsourcing gospel and 95% of its business is in Britain; it hasn't made big acquisitions; it has fewer employees; and it has stuck to dull stuff, like back-office processing. A Serco that looks more Capita sounds like an improvement.</p> <p>In the meantime, predictability in earnings has gone out of the window at Serco. The company confesses to more problems in more contracts every time it speaks. The garrison support operations in Australia made an appearance this time \u2013 \"transition costs\" may be incurred to close it.</p> <p>Soames is a highly regarded manager after his long and successful innings at Aggreko, which was why the \u00a3170m arrived without further disturbance to the share price. But the revival of Serco looks increasingly like a major restructuring job.</p>",

Buyout firm Bridgepoint has pressed the button on a stockmarket listing that values Fat Face, started by ski bums Tim Slade and Jules Leaver to subsidise their life on the slopes, at about \u00a3440m. Meanwhile, private equity firm Cinven is testing buyers' appetite for the near-500-strong restaurant chain PizzaExpress. With a mooted price tag of more than \u00a31bn, the sale would signal a breakup of the Gondola Group, which also owns ASK Italian and trendy burger chain Byron. Fat Face boss Anthony Thompson, who was parachuted in to lead a turnaround in 2010, said the business was now in rude health, with plenty of scope to expand both in the UK and overseas. The US is top of the list, with a website due to launch there within the next 12 months, followed by a handful of stores in the Boston area. The former Asda and Marks &amp; Spencer executive has overhauled the firm's clothing range and sought to cement its appeal as a family retailer \u2013 the average age of its shoppers is 41 \u2013 rather than chase younger customers, as it had in the past. \"A huge proportion of our customers are settled, cohabiting and have children,\" he said. \"We sell clothes for the whole family.\" His formula has worked, with like-for-like sales up 8.4% in the 35 weeks to 1 February. Pre-tax profits rose 28% to \u00a332m. Fat Face joins a wave of retailers coming to the market, many of them owned by private equity companies. Appliances Online, Pets at Home and Poundland have recently tapped investors to take advantage of booming stock markets and renewed confidence on the high street. The IPO triggers a long awaited payday for Bridgepoint, which bought Fat Face for \u00a3360m at what turned out to be the peak of the buyout market in 2007. Two years later it was forced to inject more funds as part of a refinancing that helped reduce the retailer's substantial pile of debt. The cash raised from the listing will be used to pay off \u00a350m of Fat Face's remaining debt \u2013 some of which is owned by Bridgepoint \u2013 leaving it with around \u00a360m on admission. The sale to Bridgepoint netted \u00a390m for Slade and Leaver, who started by selling T-shirts and sweatshirts from the back of their VW camper van in the French Alps in 1988. Today Bridgepoint owns 70% of the company, while the founders have just 0.2%. Bridgepoint and senior management, who own 20%, are in line for multimillion-pound pay outs as they plan to sell some of their holdings. The company did not disclose the size of the stakes held by Sir Stuart Rose \u2013 the former Marks &amp; Spencer chief executive who became chairman last July \u2013 Thompson and other senior managers. The Pizza Express auction is being run by Goldman Sachs. Founded in 1965, the restaurant chain has changed hands several times, with Cinven buying it for \u20ac1.3bn (\u00a31bn) at the end of 2006. With a turnover of more than \u00a3600m in the year to 30 June 2013, the company fell to a pre-tax loss of \u00a379m after \u00a3110m of interest payments on its \u00a31.2bn debt mountain \u2013 of which \u00a3651.5m is owned by shareholders.",

So if you didn't get an invite to the Worshipful Company of International Bankers dinner, you can read it here:</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Documents/speeches/2014/speech725.pdf\">Momentum in the housing market: affordability, indebtedness and risks</a></h2> <p>This is the key section, on the dangers of a hard landing plunging many households into negative equity, where their houses are worth less than their outstanding mortgages.<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The current exceptionally low level of interest rates will need to increase once the recovery is well established. So it is particularly important at present to ensure that the current low levels of interest rates do not mask the likely cost of mortgages and so create more headroom for prices to rise.</p> <p>It is possible that affordability constraints, reinforced by lenders\u2019 underwriting standards, will increasingly act as a brake on the speed at which house prices are growing and as a brake on mortgage debt. In that case, having recovered much of their fall following the crisis, we will see house price growth slow to match the pace of earnings growth \u2013 a soft landing. </p> <p>This is not without precedent. In 2004, having risen at an average rate of almost 20% over the previous</p> <p> 2 years, house price growth began to slow with the annual growth rate falling to just 2% by the middle of 2005. The 125bps increase in Bank Rate in the 13 months to September 2004 was no doubt part of the story. It proved, however, to be short lived episode. Amid a period of easing credit conditions, the pace of house price growth began to rise again through 2006, reaching double-digit rates by 2007. But it is probably an example of how affordability can brake the market. </p> <p>However, there is another way the story can play out - a major overshoot in prices and build up in debt followed by a sharp correction with negative equity and an overhang of debt for many households. The trigger for the correction can vary \u2013 in the early 89-92 episode it was a sharp rise in interest rates as the UK sought to remain in the Exchange Rate Mechanism; in 2007-9 it was a sharp tightening in credit conditions amid a collapse in confidence in an over-levered banking system \u2013 but, unfortunately, there are more precedents in UK for periods of a rapidly growing housing market to end in this way.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-53628998e4b08a82d90e001c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-05-01T17:52:21.325Z\">6.52pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Richard Edgar, ITV's economics editor, dubs it the \"strongest warning yet\" from Britain's central bank over the housing market, since the financial crisis began.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ITVRichard/statuses/461923507094704128\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>The strongest warning yet from the Bank of England on the dangers brewing in the housing market - when will it act? <a href=\"http://t.co/RV09RQXnHN\">http://t.co/RV09RQXnHN</a></p>&mdash; Richard Edgar (@ITVRichard) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ITVRichard/statuses/461923507094704128\">May 1, 2014</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-536287b3e4b08a82d90e001b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-05-01T17:45:47.881Z\">6.45pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><b>Sir Jon Cunliffe also warns that it's vital that people are not given mortgages they can't afford to pay back, just because interest rates are low today.</b> </p> <p>New affordability measures, designed to stop this, have not yet been tested, he warned.</p> <p>In tonight's hard-hitting speech, the deputy governor says it is \"particularly important\" to ensure now that current low levels of borrowing costs do not mask the likely cost of mortgages and create more headroom for prices to rise. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In this regard, the reforms following the FSA\u2019s Mortgage Market Review, which came into force last week, should help to ensure that affordability constraints do act against pressures on house prices.

A second is a major overshoot in prices and build-up in debt followed by a sharp correction with negative equity and an overhang of debt for many households. </p> <p>Jon observes that there have been more precedents in the UK for periods of a rapidly growing housing market to end in this way.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2014-05-01T17:40:17.113Z\">at 6.40pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-536273bee4b0f8602e1c7937\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-05-01T17:06:53.906Z\">6.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Moody's: Independent Scotland likely to get an A credit rating</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><b>An independent Scotland is likely to be given an A credit rating -- mid-range investment grade, in other words -- according to rating firm Moody's tonight.</b></p> <p>In a new report, Moody's said that Scotland's credit profile would 'almost certainly be consistent with an investment grade rating' if it broke away from the rest of the UK, but warned that it would face many risks.</p> <p>Moody's said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>While there are significant uncertainties associated with Scottish arrangements post-independence, an 'A' rating is perhaps the most likely at the outset, but with risks tilted to the downside.

The former science minister, and an influential voice in British business, told the Financial Times that the deal was \"undesirable', as speculation mounts that the US pharmaceutical giant will launch a larger offer for AZ within days (see 5.06pm) He fears a takeover could cause long term damage to the UK science industry, given Pfizer's track-record of cutting jobs and asset-stripping. Lord Sainsbury said: \"It is clear to me that this proposed takeover is going to deal a devastating blow to our profile in the pharmaceutical area, which I think is going to be critical in the next 30 years,\u201d \"If the government gives real leadership and says we don\u2019t want something like this to happen, the companies are smart enough to realise this is not necessarily a good thing to pursue in this particular case.\u201d And that's all from me - cheers, and goodnight. GW Sir Jon Cunliffe's speech on the UK housing market is online now, on the Bank of England's website. So if you didn't get an invite to the Worshipful Company of International Bankers dinner, you can read it here: Momentum in the housing market: affordability, indebtedness and risks This is the key section, on the dangers of a hard landing plunging many households into negative equity, where their houses are worth less than their outstanding mortgages. The current exceptionally low level of interest rates will need to increase once the recovery is well established. So it is particularly important at present to ensure that the current low levels of interest rates do not mask the likely cost of mortgages and so create more headroom for prices to rise. It is possible that affordability constraints, reinforced by lenders\u2019 underwriting standards, will increasingly act as a brake on the speed at which house prices are growing and as a brake on mortgage debt. In that case, having recovered much of their fall following the crisis, we will see house price growth slow to match the pace of earnings growth \u2013 a soft landing. This is not without precedent. In 2004, having risen at an average rate of almost 20% over the previous 2 years, house price growth began to slow with the annual growth rate falling to just 2% by the middle of 2005. The 125bps increase in Bank Rate in the 13 months to September 2004 was no doubt part of the story. It proved, however, to be short lived episode. Amid a period of easing credit conditions, the pace of house price growth began to rise again through 2006, reaching double-digit rates by 2007. But it is probably an example of how affordability can brake the market. However, there is another way the story can play out - a major overshoot in prices and build up in debt followed by a sharp correction with negative equity and an overhang of debt for many households. The trigger for the correction can vary \u2013 in the early 89-92 episode it was a sharp rise in interest rates as the UK sought to remain in the Exchange Rate Mechanism; in 2007-9 it was a sharp tightening in credit conditions amid a collapse in confidence in an over-levered banking system \u2013 but, unfortunately, there are more precedents in UK for periods of a rapidly growing housing market to end in this way. Richard Edgar, ITV's economics editor, dubs it the \"strongest warning yet\" from Britain's central bank over the housing market, since the financial crisis began. Sir Jon Cunliffe also warns that it's vital that people are not given mortgages they can't afford to pay back, just because interest rates are low today. New affordability measures, designed to stop this, have not yet been tested, he warned. In tonight's hard-hitting speech, the deputy governor says it is \"particularly important\" to ensure now that current low levels of borrowing costs do not mask the likely cost of mortgages and create more headroom for prices to rise. In this regard, the reforms following the FSA\u2019s Mortgage Market Review, which came into force last week, should help to ensure that affordability constraints do act against pressures on house prices. But they have not yet been tested. Breaking: The Bank of England's Deputy Governor for Financial Stability has warned that the UK housing market risks suffering a hard landing, in which many households could be plunged into negative equity. Sir Jon Cunliffe is telling the Worshipful Company of International Bankers tonight that: \u201cIt would be dangerous to ignore the momentum that has built up in the UK housing market since the spring of last year. The extent to which that will jeopardise financial stability depends on whether that pressure actually results in more transactions at higher prices, whether that in turn leads to an increase in household indebtedness and where that debt is concentrated.\u201d Speaking hours after Nationwide reported that prices had jumped by 10.9% annually last month, a seven year high, Cunliffe warned that there are serious consequences if households become too indebted. The Bank explains: One possibility is that the housing market could be in for a soft landing, with house price growth slowing as affordability constraints bite. A second is a major overshoot in prices and build-up in debt followed by a sharp correction with negative equity and an overhang of debt for many households. Jon observes that there have been more precedents in the UK for periods of a rapidly growing housing market to end in this way. An independent Scotland is likely to be given an A credit rating -- mid-range investment grade, in other words -- according to rating firm Moody's tonight. In a new report, Moody's said that Scotland's credit profile would 'almost certainly be consistent with an investment grade rating' if it broke away from the rest of the UK, but warned that it would face many risks. Moody's said: While there are significant uncertainties associated with Scottish arrangements post-independence, an 'A' rating is perhaps the most likely at the outset, but with risks tilted to the downside. Over time, greater clarity over (and confidence in) Scotland's institutional structure and measures to address longer-term fiscal issues could make higher rating levels attainable. An assessment of an independent Scotland on those issuers registered in Scotland covers three broad factors: (1) the impact of redenomination on outstanding debts in a new currency, given Moody's expectation that the UK authorities would likely persist in their refusal to tolerate a currency union with an independent Scotland; (2) the constraints on borrower creditworthiness coming from an independent Scotland's credit profile; and (3) any impact the economic and financial environment in an independent Scotland might have on borrower on creditworthiness. Moody's also reckoned there would be little impact on the UK's credit rating. The full report is online here: Moody's: Scottish independence unlikely to have rating implications for UK sovereign The FTSE 100 has closed for the day at its highest level in almost two months. The blue chip index was driven by reassuring financial results from Lloyds, and optimism following this morning's strong manufacturing data - showing UK factory activity growing at a five-month high. The FTSE 100 gained 28 points to 6808 - the highest level since 4th March. CMC's Markets' Jasper Lawler sums up the key moves: Shares in Lloyds rose after reporting a 22% jump in profits. The bank has cut costs and as one of Britain\u2019s biggest mortgage lenders is benefiting from higher margins in lending. Here's our story on Lloyds: TSB float imminent as Lloyds heralds return to 'low cost, low risk' banking Lawler continues: BSkyB was one of the day\u2019s top risers despite a 2.4% drop in profits as subscriptions increased more than expected. Competition has opened up for digital television with the likes of BT offering a lot of Premiership football and rugby. Sky has still managed to grow subscribers by innovation particularly in mobile with the Sky+ app. Supermarkets were under pressure again today with Sainsbury\u2019s and Tesco likely having to follow suit with the huge price cuts announced by Morrisons. It\u2019s a double whammy for supermarkets as basic food costs including corn and wheat have risen this year but competition from discounters have forced them to cut prices when they might have otherwise risen them. And AstraZeneca closed at its highest level since Pfizer made its initial approach, in a late burst as Bloomberg reported that a higher takeover bid was on the cards. US pharmaceutical giant Pfizer is considering hiking its offer for AstraZeneca, in a bid to get its UK rival to the negotiating table, Bloomberg is reporting. Nothing's official, but Pfizer is apparently considering hiking the bid to over \u00a350 per share, up from the \u00a346.61 that was rejected in January. Here's a flavour: The offer may value AstraZeneca at more than \u00a350 a share and include a larger cash component, and could come as early as next week, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing confidential information. The London-based company rejected a cash-and-stock proposal of \u00a346.61 a share. Pfizer will report its earnings on May 5. The new bid and its timing aren\u2019t final and may change, two of the people said. After speaking with some AstraZeneca shareholders, Pfizer sees an offer in the low \u00a350-per-share range gaining their support for the companies to hold talks, two people said. That would push the value of the bid up to \u00a363bn, a record for a takeover of a UK firm by a foreign one. More here: Pfizer Said to Plan Sweetening AstraZeneca Bid With Cash Ukraine's bailout may need to be redesigned if its eastern regions break away from Kiev, or if relations with Russia deteriorate even further, the International Monetary Fund has warned this afternoon. A day after agreeing a $17.1bn loan, the IMF issued a staff report which states that Ukraine faces \"unprecedented risks\", adding: The unfolding developments in the East and tense relations with Russia could severely disrupt bilateral trade and depress investment confidence for a considerable period of time, thus worsening the economic outlook. Should the central government lose effective control over the East, the [bailout] program will need to be re-designed. Yesterday,acting president Oleksandr Turchynov admitted Ukraine was struggling to combat the rolling takeover of Eastern provinces by pro-Russia gunmen. He told regional governors that \"I will be frank. Today, security forces are unable to take the situation in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions quickly under control.\" The IMF predicts that Ukraine's economy will shrink by 5% this year, having already been struggling before the Crimea crisis. The IMF warned that tensions with Russia, if not eased quickly, could lead to significant reduction in most non-energy bilateral trade. Given that Ukraine ships about a quarter of its exports to Russia, most of it exempt from customs duties, this could result in a highly disruptive negative economic shock similar in nature to, but likely smaller than, the post-transition period in the 1990s. The full staff report is online here. America's recovery may have performed even worse last quarter than we thought. A survey of the construction sector found spending rose by just 0.2% in March, much weaker than the 0.5% expected. Wall Street economists swiftly plugged this into their spreadsheets, and concluded that US GDP probably fell in the first three months of this year, rather than increasing slightly (+0.1% annualised). But how much did it shrink? Barclays now reckons US GDP fell by 0.2% annualised, or -0.05% on a quarterly basis. Deutsche Bank is gloomier, predicting a 0.4% drop in GDP (annualised). While Greek workers are drained by the pain and stress of recent years, its bankers are getting ready for a surge of bond sales this summer. So reckons analysts at Deutsche Bank, as Reuters' Chris Whittall reports: Is there protest fatigue in Greece? In Athens, unions are expressing disappointment over the low turnout for today\u2019s May Day rallies. Our correspondent Helena Smith reports. The fighting talk so often expressed by Greek unions since the outbreak of the debt crisis was certainly not matched today by the limp turnout for the traditional May Day rallies. Unions accepted that the turn-out was disappointingly low -- with the exception of unionists at the militant communist group, Pame, which insisted that protest rallies in Athens and 70 cities across Greece were attended by \u201ctens of thousands\u201d of unemployed workers, women and youths. But police estimated that not more than 15,000 Greeks attended joint rallies organized by ADEDY, which represents civil servants, and GSEE, the Confederation of Greek Workers, which represents private employees. \u201cThe turnout was disappointingly low,\u201d GSEE\u2019s president Yannis Panagopoulos told me. \u201cIt was disproportionate to the problems the country faces and generally not what we would have wanted,\u201d he said adding that the violence that has marred past May Day rallies may have deterred Greeks from attending. \u201cMy own feeling, however, is that people have given up on the street. They no longer believe unions can do much and have instead invested their hopes in a political solution which is why the forthcoming [local and European parliament] elections are so important.\u201d ADEDY\u2019s head, Odysseys Trivalas, put the poor showing down to \u201cpsychological reasons.\u201d \u201cWe expected so many more to turn up, but the truth is that there have been no victories. Unions have not managed to take back even one measure. May Day is hugely symbolic, and even more so for Greeks because of the crisis, but everyone is disappointed, hugely disappointed and psychologically down. Today was such a nice day maybe they decided to go on an excursion and enjoy themselves a bit.\u201d A Eurobarometer poll last week revealed that Greek workers were the \u201cunhappiest employees\u201d in the EU with 82% describing their working conditions as \u201cbad\u201d \u2013 the highest in the 28-nation bloc. HS Amna Asaf of Capital Economics agrees that America's factory sector has put last winter's blizzards behind it. Here's her take on ISM's manufacturing survey: The further rise in the ISM manufacturing index to 54.9 in April, from 53.7, illustrates that the factory sector is still getting back to normal after the earlier weather-related disruptions. This was the third monthly increase in a row. Although there were no spectacular improvements across the sub-indices, the details of the survey suggest that manufacturing activity is being supported by decent demand at home. Both the new orders index (unchanged at 55.1) and the production index (at 55.7, from 55.9) remained close to their March levels, which remain at a decent level. That strong ISM manufacturing report indicates the US economy picked up in April.... ....indicating the Federal Reserve was correct to suggest last night that economicc conditions are improving this spring. Growth isn't as strong as in the UK, where the manufacturing PMI hit a five month high of57.3 this morning. But factories on both side of the Atlantic cranked things up last month, which bodes well for global growth prospects.... The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) reports that America's manufacturing growth accelerated in April, for the third month running. The ISM report beat Wall Street forecasts, with its index of factory activity jumping to 54.9 in April, from 53.9 in March (any reading over 50 shows growth). That's the highest reading since December, and the eighth monthly expansion in a row. The survey (not to be confused with Markit's PMI survey, released earlier) found that employment growth picked up, and new orders growth was unchanged. America's manufacturing sector posted solid growth in April, data provider Markit reported, in its latest assessment of the US factory sector. Markit's US manufacturing PMI came in at 55.4, little changed from March's 55.5, indicating another steady increase in activity. Output and new orders both rose at a faster pace, although the pace of new hirings slowed. Trading just began on Wall Street, and the Dow Jones index has dropped back from last night's record high. The Dow is down 27 points in early trading at 16553, -0.17%, following last week's unexpected jump in unemployment benefit claims (see here) There's a 30% chance that the Bank of England will raise interest rates by the end of this year, according to a poll of City economists by Reuters. The survey, of 46 economists, also found that the first rate rise is most likely to take place in the second quarter of 2015. Nearly two thirds of those polled also think UK business investment will rise by at least 10% this year, as the BoE forecast in February. The pound could surge higher tomorrow morning if the latest survey of the construction sector matches today's strong manufacturing data. So reckons Philip Hoey of Caxton FX: \u201cSterling has risen to a 4\u00bd year high against the US dollar this morning, rising above 1.69 for the first time since August 2009 after UK Manufacturing PMI data was much better than expected. The Manufacturing PMI figure came in at 57.3 against a forecast of 55.4. Any figure above 50 signifies growth in the sector, and this release reveals the pace of growth in the British manufacturing sector is speeding up. If British Construction PMI data tomorrow morning is as a solid as today\u2019s manufacturing figure, we could see another sterling rally tomorrow morning.\u201d US consumers dipped into their purses and wallets with renewed vigour in March. Personal spending jumped by 0.9%, the biggest monthly rise since August 2009. This surge in spending came alongside a rise in personal incomes, up 0.5% during the month, suggesting Americans are feeling richer -- despite the US economy grinding to a near-halt over the winter. One theory for the weak US jobs data: Lots of US economic data was just announced, including an unexpected jump in the number of Americans signing on for jobless benefit. The initial claims total jumped to 344,000 last week, up from 333,000 the previous week. Analysts had expected a fall, to 319,000. The number of continuing claims for unemployment benefit also rose, to 2.771m, from 2.674m. This may suggest tomorrow's Non-Farm Payroll could be a disappointment, and may show fewer new jobs than expected were created last month than expected. Greece's May Day protests appeared to pass off pretty peacefully - no repeat of the dramatic scenes of 2012. The Athens government has been predicting an economic upturn this year, with prime minister Antonis Samaras telling Greece to expect more than 20 million tourists this year. Samaras declared: \u201cThe sick residues of the past are over, we are proceeding finally towards a Greece of growth\". Another takeover deal - and this time it's a UK firm buying an American one. Savills, the estate agent and property consultant chain, is snapping up Studley, the US commercial real estate services firm, in a bid to expand deeper into the US market. It's paying $130m up front, possibly rising to $260m, in cash, promissory notes and shares. Savills reckons the deal will give it \"a significant US footprint\" and a strong platform for further growth both in the US and through Savills existing businesses in Asia and Europe. Jeremy Helsby, group chief executive of Savills, explains why the deal makes sense: \"Studley is recognised for its exceptional tenant representation expertise and is the leading player in markets throughout the United States. The combination of Studley and Savills represents a unique opportunity which not only provides us with a significant platform for growth in the US, but also enhances our offering to clients worldwide allowing us to provide a truly global service.\" Rolls-Royce is facing its shareholders today, at its annual general meeting in London. Sean Farrell's there, and tweets that it's not going too smoothly... Starting a new job is often tricky, but few people have had a first day quite like Rupert Soames, the new CEO of troubled outsourcing firm Serco. Soames, Sir Winston Churchill's grandson, barely had his knees under the desk before asking the City for \u00a3170m to buy the group some time to placate its lenders. He's begun the task with Churchillian enthusiasm, telling reporters that: : \"I'm sitting here with my satchel, my protractor set , and large pink eraser on my first day at school\". But will \u00a3170m be enough to placate Serco's banks? Analysts fear the firm is in a \"downward spiral\", since the scandal broke over billing the UK government for electronically tagging prisoners who were dead. Sir Winston Churchill's grandson asks Serco shareholders for \u00a3170m Housekeeping note -- my talented colleagues have just pushed the button on some new changes to the Guardian's liveblogs. You can seen them if you're using our beta site (click here to join the fun), or reading on a mobile device. It includes a new 'key events' box to help readers find the main developments. The City watchdog has banned the UBS executive who managed rogue trader Kweku Adoboli. The Financial Conduct Authority ruled that John Christopher Hughes was not a \"fit and proper person\" to work in UK financial industry, for failings over Adoboli's unauthorised trading losses which cost UBS \u00a31.5bn. Adoboli was convicted in November 2012, and jailed for seven years, after concealing trades in a secret account called the \u201cUmbrella\u201d. After an investigatiin, the FCA concluded that Hughes was aware the Umbrella existed, was being used to misrepresent his department's profits and losses, and would not be authorised by UBS. But he didn't report it, meaning Adobol ran up larger losses before being uncovered.. Tracey McDermott, the FCA's director of enforcement and financial crime, said: \u201cHughes was the most senior person on the Exchange Traded Funds (ETF) desk. He should have been acting as a role model to others. Instead he failed to report the Umbrella and allowed the Desk\u2019s profit and loss to be misstated over an extended period. This failure contributed to Adoboli\u2019s unauthorised trading continuing unchecked. Approved people should operate to the highest standards of integrity. This means not only doing the right thing themselves but also challenging, and blowing the whistle on, those who are not. Hughes failed to do so with catastrophic consequences.\u201d Just in - photos from Canary Wharf as police conducted a controlled explosion of that suspicious package outside Barclays HQ: And one Barclays staffer told Harriet Dennys of the Telegraph that: \u201cThere\u2019s chaos in the mall, with thousands of bankers everywhere. Everyone\u2019s really confused as we haven\u2019t been given any information by Barclays. But there are rumours there has been a small controlled explosion outside the building.\" Back in the financial markets, the pound remains at a near five-year high, following the surge in UK manufacturing activity reported in April (details and reaction start here). This graph shows how sterling has gained almost 15% against the US dollar since last summer, as investors bet that the Bank of England would raise rates earlier than its own forecast of 2016 (since revised to 2015). It's currently trading at $1.691, the highest since August 2009. Manufacturing firms have, so far, shrugged off the stronger pound -- which makes their goods more expensive overseas, but also makes imported raw materials cheaper. Martin Beck, senior economic adviser to the EY ITEM Club, explains: \u201cDespite sterling climbing even higher over the last month, April\u2019s survey pointed to an increase in manufacturing export orders. And the strong pound may be providing some offsetting benefits, with average purchase prices paid by manufacturers falling for the second successive month, driven in part by lower import costs. Reuters Television reporter Joanna Partridge has the latest: Reuters correspondent Chris Vellacott reports that there's currently a bomb squad cordon in Canary Wharf: Drama in Canary Wharf this morning, after a suspicious package was found close to Barclays' headquarters. Staff at Barclays say the HQ was locked down, while police sent in a bomb disposal robot to deal with the object. Sources close to the building say a controlled explosion has taken place. Just spoke to a Barclays insider, who confirmed there was activity outside the building, and that staff had been advised to stay at their desks. Reuters reports: Police carried out a controlled explosion in the Canary Wharf financial district of east London after a suspicious package was found near the Barclays headquarters, a security official said. Canary Wharf Group, which runs the property estate, said police were maintaining a cordon around the area until they deem the area is safe, according to a memo circulated and seen by Reuters. While British manufacturing output has jumped, the number of mortgages being approved has fallen, to a six month low. Just 67,135 house loans were approved in March, the Bank of England reports, down from 69,592 in February. That may suggest banks are tightening their lending criteria (and that the Bank's decision to remove mortgages from the UK's Funding For Lending scheme is having an effect too). Neil Prothero, deputy chief economist at EEF (the manufacturers organisation), says British industry will grow by at least 3% this year, the fastest rate in four years. The domestic market remains the dominant driver of manufacturing activity, although there are some encouraging signs from a rise in export flows that the gradual revival in Eurozone demand is beginning to feed through to manufacturers\u2019 order books. Jeremy Cook, chief economist at the currency brokers World First, says the Britain's manufacturing and industrial landscape is improving, as orders flooding in from home and abroad: \u201cDemand was both higher in domestic and export markets as the global economy continues to repair itself with improvement in overall output and new orders leading to another monthly improvement in manufacturing jobs. \u201cWe have now seen manufacturing jobs increase every month for the past year \u2013 a natural function of companies reacting to backlogs and ongoing forward demand. The pound has hit its highest level in almost five years on the back of the strong UK manufacturing data, blasting through the $1.69 mark. Sterling soared to $1.6921, its highest rate against the US dollar since August 2009, as traders anticipate the prospect of an earlier interest rate rise. Another highlight -- Britain's factories cranked up their output to the third-fastest rate in two decades, says Markit. Activity in Britain's manufacturing sector has surged at the fastest rate in five months, bolstering hopes that the recovery is broadening. Markit's monthly survey of purchasing managers showed that output and exports rose strongly last month. This pushed the UK manufacturing PMI up to 57.3, much stronger than March's 55.8, indicating strong growth. Any reading over 50 shows the sector expanded, and 57.3 is the highest reading since last November. It's much stronger than City economists expected, too. Growth increased across the manufacturing sector, as firms reported a rise in new orders, and new product launches. Manufacturers also took on more staff -- with employment rising for the twelfth consecutive month. The survey suggests that UK manufacturing could grow by more than 1.5% in the April-June quarter, on top of its 1.3% surge in the first three months of the year. Rob Dobson, Markit's senior economist,, said manufacturing output growth had accelerated to \"a level among the highest signalled over the past two decades\". Supporting these efforts are a strong domestic market and improving global economic conditions, while the ongoing solid upswing in employment is providing the capacity to meet the needs of demand looking ahead. The PMI survey suggests that manufacturers are creating around 10,000 new jobs each month. Reaction to follow.... Manufacturing data from the eurozone, released this morning, showed that activity in Ireland's industrial base grew at fastest rate in three years. Its PMI, calculated by Markit, hit 56.1 - up from 55.5 in March. But the Netherlands' manufacturing PMI dipped to 53.4, from 53.7 -- the slowest growth rate in nine months (but also the 10th straight month of growth). Lloyds Banking Group is preparing to float its TSB retail business on the London stock market before the end of June, as it strives to become a normal bank again. Shares in TSB, which is challenging the Big Four high street banks, are to be offered for sale to the public in the next eight weeks. City editor Jill Treanor explains: The flotation of TSB is to take place following the aborted talks with Co-operative Bank to sell the 631 branches, after which TSB was spun out of the wider Lloyds branch network last year. The sale must take place if Lloyds is to meet the requirements set out by the EU at the time of its taxpayer bailout in 2008, when the government took a 43% stake. This has now fallen to 24% after two placings with big City institutions since last September. Here's her full story: TSB float imminent as Lloyds heralds return to 'low cost, low risk' banking Over in Greece, unions are holding anti-austerity protest marches to mark May Day. A demonstration led by the communist PAME union has already headed towards the Athens parliament - here's some tweets from the scene: In the City, the FTSE 100 has hit its highest level in seven weeks. The blue-chip index is up 21 points at 6801, a gain of 0.3%. BSkyB is leading the risers, up 4% after reporting its biggest jump in new TV subscribers in five years. A 6.6% rise in revenues over the nine months also cheered investors. Lloyds Banking Group is up 3.4% - it reported a 2% increase in underlying properties. And, in a welcome change, it didn't set aside any more funds for PPI compensation. Last night's upbeat statement from the US Federal Reserve appears to have reassured the markets. The Dow Jones index hit a record high last night, after the Fed declared that: \u201cGrowth in economic activity has picked up recently, after having slowed sharply during the winter in part because of adverse weather conditions\u201d Reckon there's a housing bubble in London? You're not alone. IHS economist Howard Archer says: It is certainly justifiable to talk of a house price bubble in London (where Nationwide data show that prices jumped 5.3% quarter-on-quarter and 18.2% year-on-year in the first quarter)... ...but the strength of house prices is not yet a serious problem outside of the capital and housing market activity is still not unduly strong compared to long-term norms, so in these respects it is premature to talk of a general housing market bubble. Here's my colleague Hilary Osborne's take on today's housing stats: The annual rate at which UK house prices are increasing moved into double digits in April, according to figures from the country's largest building society, as low mortgage rates and a mismatch between supply and demand for homes continued to drive the market.... More here: Double-digit house price inflation as fears of bubble increase UK house prices have now been higher than a year ago for 14 months in a row, back to March 2013. That's the month when George Osborne announced the Help to Buy scheme, and also the time when Britain's economic recovery finally picked up pace. In London, the proportion of house sales involving properties over \u00a3500,000 has almost doubled to 25%, from 13% in 2007. Properties worth \u00a31m or more now make up more than 6% of all sales, more than double the rate seven years ago: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, the eurozone and business...and a Happy May Day to you all too. Britain's housing market has boom has picked up pace, with prices surging at their fastest rate in almost seven years. And expensive properties are leading the way. The latest figures from Nationwide, released, this morning, show prices jumped by 10.9% in the year to April, outpacing wage rises again, and adding to fears that homes are becoming unaffordable for a growing section of the population. That's the first double-digit increase since April 2010, and the biggest rise since June 2007, the start of the credit crunch. Economists had expected the housing market to cool off this spring. But, according to Nationwide's data, prices jumped 1.2% in April alone, pushing up the average price to \u00a3183,577. Robert Gardner, Nationwide's chief economist, said rising economic confidence is helping to push prices up, and warned that demand continues to outstrip supply: Earnings growth is beginning to pick up, with wage increases finally outpacing the rise in the cost of living in February. Nevertheless, house price growth is outstripping income growth by a wide margin. The risk is that unless supply accelerates significantly, affordability will become stretched. London remains a property hotspot, with prices now 20% above their pre-crisis peak (the UK average is still 2% lower). The strongest growth is in regions where prices were already high. Gardner says: Interestingly, price growth in London and the South East appears to be being driven by the top end of the market, with higher priced locations recording stronger price growth And here's the chart to prove it: Reaction to follow.... Plenty of other news afoot this morning, including a nasty profits warning from Sony a few minutes ago, as the cost of exiting its PC business spiralled, results from Lloyds, and the ongoing turmoil at outsourcing group Serco (which dramatically lost its finance director last night). The latest PMI survey of Britain's manufacturing sector from the UK is out this morning too (9.30am) Most European stock markets are going to be closed today for a bank holiday to mark workers' rights. I\"m still here though (hmmm), and the London stock market will be open as usual. And Greek unions will be holding protest rallies in Athens later today too.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "High-street banking business TSB is to be floated on the stock market in the next eight weeks and some of the shares offered to the public, its current owner Lloyds Banking Group has said. Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio, the boss of Lloyds, said at least a 25% stake in the TSB branches would be sold off in the first offering of the staged disposal of a business that has 631 branches and which he had originally hoped to sell to the Co-operative Bank. He confirmed the sale was on track as he declared Lloyds was a \"low-cost, low-risk bank\" and promised to resume dividends to shareholders for the first time since the financial crisis. The sale of TSB \u2013 whose fascia was revived on the high street in September \u2013 must take place if Lloyds is to meet the requirements set out by the European Union at the time of its taxpayer bailout in 2008, when the government took a 43% stake. This has now fallen to 24% after two placings with big City institutions since September. Lloyds missed the first deadline imposed by the EU of November 2013, when Co-op abandoned the talks last year and embarked on its own \u00a31.5bn emergency fundraising. Lloyds has now sought permission to sell off the branch network by the end of 2015. TSB is positioning itself as a challenger to the big four banks of Lloyds, HSBC, Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland in the current account market, in which its rivals are dominant, by paying a 5% rate of interest on balances up to \u00a32,000. Horta-Os\u00f3rio is in line for a \u00a31.7m share bonus if half of the remaining taxpayer holding is sold or if the share price remains above 73.6p \u2013 the break-even point of the taxpayer bailout \u2013 for six months. The shares were the biggest risers in the FTSE 100 on Thursday ending up 5.5% at 70.5p after the bank issued an upbeat trading update. First-half profits were down to \u00a31.3bn but up 22% on the same quarter a year ago at \u00a31.8bn if the costs associated with preparing TSB for flotation and other items are stripped out. Talks with the Prudential Regulation Authority, the Bank of England's regulatory arm, are to begin in the second half about resuming dividend payments to shareholders for the first time since the 2008. The finance director, George Culmer, conceded shareholders were unlikely to get any dividend payment until May 2015, around the time of the next general election. The payment would relate to the bank's performance in 2014. But Culmer said the bank would be beginning the talks with the PRA \u2013 at the time when it also subjecting the industry to tough stress tests \u2013 when it was in a strong position. \"We will go into those discussions with confidence about the business and about our prospects,\" he said. Asked about the size of a retail offering \u2013 shares available to individuals \u2013 Culmer was not specific. \"There will be a retail element. The final details in terms of issuance and allocation are still to be decided,\" he said.

These things are priceless because they are so fundamental to our lives and wellbeing.</p> <p>But most would also agree that our inability to accurately value these things does not mean that they should be left out altogether from economic modelling, a method the government uses to inform decision making.</p> <p>So how does the government take these things into account when it weighs up the costs and benefits of climate change policies?</p> <p>Well it turns out that a key model used by the Treasury does not take these things into account at all.

      "bodyText": "Most people would agree that we can never put an accurate monetary value on our health or the environment in which we live. These things are priceless because they are so fundamental to our lives and wellbeing. But most would also agree that our inability to accurately value these things does not mean that they should be left out altogether from economic modelling, a method the government uses to inform decision making. So how does the government take these things into account when it weighs up the costs and benefits of climate change policies? Well it turns out that a key model used by the Treasury does not take these things into account at all. The HMRC-CGE model, which is primarily designed to give information on how tax policies affect the economy, has been very influential in government decision making on climate change policy and in particular the forthcoming decision on whether to adopt or weaken the fourth carbon budget. A WWF and Friends of the Earth report by Frank Ackerman and Joseph Daniel, of Synapse Energy Economics, shines a spotlight on this rather secretive model and concludes that it is, as a tool, flawed and misleading for aiding understanding of the economic impacts of climate change policy. So what's wrong with the model? Well first, by failing to place a value on environmental and health benefits, \"externalities\" in economic terms, the model quantifies the costs but ignores the key benefits of climate change policies and is predisposed to always conclude that environmental policies damage the economy. As Ackerman puts it: \"For lack of meaningful prices, basic values such as protection of human life, health, biodiversity and the existence of unique habitats and landscapes are omitted. As a result, the principal benefits of many climate and environmental policies cannot be incorporated in a HMRC CGE analysis.\" In a nutshell, if you don't place a value on reducing air pollution, reducing the risk of flooding, avoiding sea level rises or any other benefits of tackling climate change, then you are never going to conclude that interventions to tackle these things are beneficial. Second, the model assumes that everyone who wants a job has one, so there is no involuntary unemployment. This means that the model would treat the recent announcement that Siemens and Associated British Ports (ABP) will invest millions in an offshore wind production plant in Hull, expected to create up to 1,000 jobs, as hitting the economy by stealing employees and investment from other sectors. In reality, it is quite clear that this is a massive boost in a region where jobs are sorely needed. Last but by no means least, the Treasury's modelling ignores the existence of other countries and so cannot capture the export opportunities for the UK as a first mover in clean technologies such as electric cars, offshore wind, and carbon capture and storage. Perhaps even more significantly this approach also means the model is incapable of capturing the complexities of climate change as a global problem requiring collective action. This year's report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) made it clear that without further efforts to reduce carbon emissions unmitigated climate change is set to have major impacts, including damaging the production of food and availability of freshwater. Cooperation, fairness and collective action all come into play. If every country weighs up their climate policy decisions using such a limited cost-focused model and concludes that tackling climate change is not in their best interests, then we all lose.

      "bodyText": "The strength of the pound and a one-off charge for fixing a product problem will reduce Rolls-Royce's profits by \u00a370m this year. The engineering group said sterling's rise against the US dollar and the euro would cost it \u00a3300m in reduced revenue and \u00a340m in profit, Rolls said in a trading update. A \u00a330m payment to put right a problem with product quality and lower services volume will reduce revenue and profit at Rolls's marine business. Rolls shocked the market in February when it announced that a decade of revenue growth had come to an end and that profits would be flat this year. The group now expects profits to fall because of the pound's strength and problems at the marine business, which it had predicted would show modest profit growth. The company declined to say more about the product quality glitch at its marine arm. \"At a business level, we maintain guidance except in marine, where we now expect a reduction of around 10% in profit and revenue compared to 2013, caused by the one-off charge and lower services volume,\" it said. Rolls, which holds its annual general meeting on Thursday, said revenue and profit would now be weighted towards the second half of the year. As a result, first-half free cash flow will be between \u00a3200m and \u00a3400m lower than in the first half of 2013. The world's second-biggest aircraft engine maker stuck to its guidance that growth would pick up again next year. Rolls said it had agreed to make changes to its accounting policies and description of its business after the Financial Reporting Council questioned how the group reports contracts to service its engines. Rolls said it did not expect the watchdog to require further restatements of the contracts. Rolls said it was still in talks with Siemens to sell its energy gas turbine and compressor business to the German company. It announced discussions on the deal, reportedly worth about \u00a3800m, on Tuesday.",

Research by the housing charity Shelter and consultancy firm KPMG suggests that more than half of those aged 20-34 could be living with their parents by 2040 as rising housing costs lock them out of the property market. In a report called Building The Homes We Need, the organisations call for whichever party that wins the 2015 election to address housing in an emergency budget and a new bill, introduced within 100 days of getting into government. An estimated 240,000 new homes are needed in England to keep up with demand from new households, but even before the financial downturn building was running at well below that level. Last year, just under 110,000 homes were completed, and the report argues that without action the average price of a home in England, as measured by Nationwide building society, will double from its current level to reach \u00a3446,000 in 10 years.

      "standfirst": "<p>A debt levy won't solve the long-term problem of our tax system, but abolishing the tax fuel credit would be a solid start</p>", 
      "body": "<p>The proposed \u201cdebt levy\u201d is a good step towards improving the government\u2019s revenue, but it is only a limited solution. While it will help increase revenue it also will increase the government\u2019s already large reliance on income tax. Real revenue reform needs to look beyond income tax if the government wants to find permanent solutions.<br></p> <p>There has been a lot of confusion about the debt levy. Firstly let\u2019s cut the bull \u2013 a levy is a tax; it\u2019s just a type of tax \u2013 usually done for a specific purpose and often (such as with the Medicare levy) charged on a person\u2019s entire income.<br></p> <p>Secondly it\u2019s a stupid idea to raise a tax just to pay off a deficit so you can then give a tax break. That\u2019s not so much robbing Peter to pay Paul, as robbing Peter to pay Peter.<br></p> <p>Finally we need to be clear about how the levy will work.</p> <p>The first reports were that it was to be a levy of 1% for those earning over $80,000, and 2% for those earning over $180,000, and that like the Medicare levy it would apply to all income. By Wednesday this had changed to the 1% and 2% merely being an increase in the tax rates, and would apply only to income earned above the respective thresholds.<br></p> <p>This, it goes without saying, makes a big difference. For those earning over $80,000 it is an $800 difference, for those earning over $180,000 it is $3,600.</p> <p>Indeed a 1% levy on all your income would mean some people would be better off not earning over $80,000. If the levy was charged on all your income, you would need to earn $81,400 before your after-tax pay would be more than had you earned just $80,000:<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Income after tax graph\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/lJJql/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"480\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>While 1% may not sound like much, to raise the same amount of tax by just increasing the nominal tax rate would require someone on $85,000 to pay a tax rate of 54% tax on income earned over $80,000 \u2013 that\u2019s a fair jump from 37%.<br></p> <p>Such a levy, while progressive, would be pretty stupid in the current economic environment. Our debt situation is not urgent, and such a tax increase would smash our already weak economic growth due to consumers cutting back spending.</p> <p>As Crikey\u2019s<a href=\"http://www.crikey.com.au/?p=435118\"> Bernard Keane noted</a>, the reduction in spending would also see goods and services tax (GST) revenue fall \u2013 making it doubly stupid.</p> <p>Tony Abbott\u2019s logic on it all was also all over the shop \u2013 arguing the increase would be temporary pain but would lead to permanent gain.</p> <p>Unfortunately the problems with the revenue side of our budget are not temporary.</p> <p>If we look at the past 20 years, it\u2019s obvious there\u2019s been a fairly dramatic change to revenue since 2007:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Australia government taxation revenue graph\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/u7TBP/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"480\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>That was OK while the mining boom was happening and company tax was soaring. But when the global financial crisis (GFC) hit, income tax revenue fell further to 9.3% of GDP (the lowest on record).<br></p> <p>The big income tax cuts during this time were to the top tier. The threshold for the top rate of tax went from $62,500 in 2003-04 to $180,000 by 2008-09. As I noted<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2014/apr/08/increase-taxes-to-balance-the-budget-the-revenue-well-is-not-dry\"> two weeks ago</a>, that saw it rise from about 1.3 times the average wage to about 2.5 now.</p> <p>Crucially though, there has been little change in the ratio of the second-highest tax threshold: it has shifted between 108% to 137% of the average wage, and is currently about 110%.</p> <p>But 10 years ago 15% of taxpayers were in the top tax bracket, and they raised 51% of the tax; the latest figures show only 3% pay the top tax rate and now they raise 26.2% of total tax.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Top tax bracket: % of tax payers and tax paid graph\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/Dlt8z/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"480\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>So while some commentators warn of the dangers of bracket creep and<a href=\"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/opinion/editorials/the-deficit-levy-is-just-a-new-tax-by-another-name/story-e6frg71x-1226900126241\"> even argue</a> the top tax threshold should have already been raised to $203,000, the reality is that fewer people in the past eight years have been paying the top tax rate than at any time in our history.<br></p> <p>Thus increasing the top two tax rates is a sensible way to increase revenue, because it is not so large that economic growth will take much of a hit, and it certainly targets the wealthiest. </p> <p>However reducing the tax, as Abbott says will happen in three years, will only see revenue fall again. Moreover the debt levy does nothing to solve the long-term problem of our tax system which, ironically, is that we rely too much on income tax:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Tax receipts as a % of total revenue graph\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/LhvyK/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"480\" height=\"480\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>By 2017-18 the government is expected to rely on personal income tax revenue more than it ever has since the introduction of the GST.<br></p> <p>Direct taxes such as personal income tax and company taxes account for about 70% of government revenue. This is not an efficient way to raise tax. As we saw during the GFC, such taxes can drop pretty quickly during economic downturns. They also tax labour and capital \u2013 and thus create disincentives to work and to invest.</p> <p>Most nations in the OECD have a broader tax base and direct taxes account for only about 60% of total revenue (and less if you exclude social security contributions).</p> <p>The problem is exacerbated when you consider that our company tax rate needs to remain competitive with other nations because companies (unlike most workers) can leave or choose to invest elsewhere.</p> <p>For now Australia remains an attractive place to invest, but in the future it is likely we will have to reduce our company tax rate to remain competitive. This was the main reason the<a href=\"http://taxreview.treasury.gov.au/content/FinalReport.aspx?doc=html/publications/papers/Final_Report_Part_1/chapter_5.htm\"> Henry tax review</a> recommended lowering it over time from 30% to 25%.</p> <p>But doing that without changing anything else will place more burden on personal income tax.</p> <p>The deficit levy will go some way to restoring the government\u2019s revenue but ironically will exacerbate the problems with its tax base \u2013 especially because the government will also abolish the mining and carbon taxes.</p> <p>For real revenue reform, tinkering with income tax won\u2019t cut it. The issue of broadening the GST, or abolishing the fuel tax credit, ending the freeze on fuel excise indexation, remain to be tackled. Lenore Taylor<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/30/fuel-tax-credit-firmly-in-sights-of-coalitions-budget-razor-gang\"> reported on Wednesday</a> that the government was considering abolishing the tax fuel credit. Doing so would give this budget the real sniff of one that is serious about revenue reform; the debt levy does not. </p> <p><b><br></b><br></p>",

While it will help increase revenue it also will increase the government\u2019s already large reliance on income tax. Real revenue reform needs to look beyond income tax if the government wants to find permanent solutions. There has been a lot of confusion about the debt levy. Firstly let\u2019s cut the bull \u2013 a levy is a tax; it\u2019s just a type of tax \u2013 usually done for a specific purpose and often (such as with the Medicare levy) charged on a person\u2019s entire income. Secondly it\u2019s a stupid idea to raise a tax just to pay off a deficit so you can then give a tax break. That\u2019s not so much robbing Peter to pay Paul, as robbing Peter to pay Peter. Finally we need to be clear about how the levy will work. The first reports were that it was to be a levy of 1% for those earning over $80,000, and 2% for those earning over $180,000, and that like the Medicare levy it would apply to all income. By Wednesday this had changed to the 1% and 2% merely being an increase in the tax rates, and would apply only to income earned above the respective thresholds. This, it goes without saying, makes a big difference. For those earning over $80,000 it is an $800 difference, for those earning over $180,000 it is $3,600. Indeed a 1% levy on all your income would mean some people would be better off not earning over $80,000. If the levy was charged on all your income, you would need to earn $81,400 before your after-tax pay would be more than had you earned just $80,000: While 1% may not sound like much, to raise the same amount of tax by just increasing the nominal tax rate would require someone on $85,000 to pay a tax rate of 54% tax on income earned over $80,000 \u2013 that\u2019s a fair jump from 37%. Such a levy, while progressive, would be pretty stupid in the current economic environment. Our debt situation is not urgent, and such a tax increase would smash our already weak economic growth due to consumers cutting back spending. As Crikey\u2019s Bernard Keane noted, the reduction in spending would also see goods and services tax (GST) revenue fall \u2013 making it doubly stupid. Tony Abbott\u2019s logic on it all was also all over the shop \u2013 arguing the increase would be temporary pain but would lead to permanent gain. Unfortunately the problems with the revenue side of our budget are not temporary. If we look at the past 20 years, it\u2019s obvious there\u2019s been a fairly dramatic change to revenue since 2007: That was OK while the mining boom was happening and company tax was soaring. But when the global financial crisis (GFC) hit, income tax revenue fell further to 9.3% of GDP (the lowest on record). The big income tax cuts during this time were to the top tier. The threshold for the top rate of tax went from $62,500 in 2003-04 to $180,000 by 2008-09. As I noted two weeks ago, that saw it rise from about 1.3 times the average wage to about 2.5 now. Crucially though, there has been little change in the ratio of the second-highest tax threshold: it has shifted between 108% to 137% of the average wage, and is currently about 110%. But 10 years ago 15% of taxpayers were in the top tax bracket, and they raised 51% of the tax; the latest figures show only 3% pay the top tax rate and now they raise 26.2% of total tax. So while some commentators warn of the dangers of bracket creep and even argue the top tax threshold should have already been raised to $203,000, the reality is that fewer people in the past eight years have been paying the top tax rate than at any time in our history. Thus increasing the top two tax rates is a sensible way to increase revenue, because it is not so large that economic growth will take much of a hit, and it certainly targets the wealthiest. However reducing the tax, as Abbott says will happen in three years, will only see revenue fall again. Moreover the debt levy does nothing to solve the long-term problem of our tax system which, ironically, is that we rely too much on income tax: By 2017-18 the government is expected to rely on personal income tax revenue more than it ever has since the introduction of the GST. Direct taxes such as personal income tax and company taxes account for about 70% of government revenue. This is not an efficient way to raise tax. As we saw during the GFC, such taxes can drop pretty quickly during economic downturns. They also tax labour and capital \u2013 and thus create disincentives to work and to invest. Most nations in the OECD have a broader tax base and direct taxes account for only about 60% of total revenue (and less if you exclude social security contributions). The problem is exacerbated when you consider that our company tax rate needs to remain competitive with other nations because companies (unlike most workers) can leave or choose to invest elsewhere. For now Australia remains an attractive place to invest, but in the future it is likely we will have to reduce our company tax rate to remain competitive. This was the main reason the Henry tax review recommended lowering it over time from 30% to 25%. But doing that without changing anything else will place more burden on personal income tax. The deficit levy will go some way to restoring the government\u2019s revenue but ironically will exacerbate the problems with its tax base \u2013 especially because the government will also abolish the mining and carbon taxes. For real revenue reform, tinkering with income tax won\u2019t cut it. The issue of broadening the GST, or abolishing the fuel tax credit, ending the freeze on fuel excise indexation, remain to be tackled. Lenore Taylor reported on Wednesday that the government was considering abolishing the tax fuel credit. Doing so would give this budget the real sniff of one that is serious about revenue reform; the debt levy does not.",
