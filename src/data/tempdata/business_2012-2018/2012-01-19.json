      "bodyText": "To all intents and purposes it is the end of the \"Kodak moment\". More than 130 years after a \"not especially gifted\" high school dropout, George Eastman, founded the camera company that dominated photography for most of the 20th century, Kodak Eastman filed for bankruptcy protection in the US on Thursday. The company which once sold 90% of the film used in the US and made a type of film \u2013 Kodachrome \u2013 so beloved by amateur and professional photographers that Paul Simon wrote a hit song about it, finally succumbed to the digital revolution which left its products obsolete after years of ferocious competition from more light-footed rivals in the Far East. The company, whose little yellow boxes could once be found throughout the world, had tried to reinvent itself as a manufacturer of printers to capitalise on its reputation as the best for film printing. But despite the closure of 13 factories, 130 processing labs and 47,000 job losses, the business had little choice but to file for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The filing lists its assets as worth $5.1bn \u2013 but its debts stand at $6.8bn. \"The board of directors and the senior management team unanimously believe this is the right thing to do for the future of Kodak,\" said chief executive Antonio Perez. He told the company's 19,000 employees, who face further cost structure \"transformation\", that they are \"essential to our future\". A $950m loan from US investment bank Citigroup will give Kodak 18 months of breathing space while it tries to sell 1,100 patents it believes are worth more than $1bn. Chief among them is its claim on digital imaging rights because, in a cruel twist, the company that pioneered the creation of the digital camera was eventually brought down by its failure to invest in its own ground-breaking invention. \"Kodak was the first company to create the digital camera, but back then most of its profits came from selling chemicals [used for developing film], and they were afraid to invest because they thought it would eat into the traditional business,\" said Olivier Laurent, news editor of the British Journal of Photography. \"When they realised the digital market was here to stay, it had overtaken film, and all Kodak's competitors had far superior digital cameras. Kodak's were never as good and the company lost its 'Kodak moment' reputation as the best in the business.\" Kodak, which produced the first mass market Brownie camera priced at $1 in 1900 with the slogan \"You push the button, we do the rest\", created the first digital camera in 1975. The original prototype was size of a toaster, had to be held still for a 23-second exposure and only produced 0.01 megapixel black and white images. But the company, which had 145,000 staff in its 1980s heyday, put the technology on the backburner. By 1992, Don Strickland, a former Kodak vice-president, said the company was ready to bring in digital cameras \u2013 which would have been another first \u2013 but his bosses vetoed it over fears of the \"cannibalisation of film\". \"There will be no more 'Kodak moments' - after 133 years, the company has run its course,\" he told the BBC. In more recent years point-and-shoot cameras have been discarded in favour of ever more powerful smartphones with high resolution cameras built-in. \"Kodak was used to selling cheap cameras but with expensive film, where they made all the money. It worked because everyone wanted Kodak film,\" said Laurent. \"But now phones are eating up the compact camera market. Why have a compact camera when an 8 megapixels iPhone is almost as good and it's always there in your pocket?\" Robert Burley, professor of photography at Ryerson University in Toronto, said: \"Kodak has been obliterated by the creative destruction of a digital age. Like many of its competitors, it appears unable to make the transition into the 21st century. Five years ago, it was unthinkable that this American business legend would find itself in a bankruptcy position. Kodak was caught in a perfect storm of not only technological, but also social and economic change.\" Eastman had a degenerative spinal disorder and took his own life in 1932, but for decades afterwards Kodak retained its position with a succession of innovations. Kodachrome was a slide and motion-picture film produced for 74 years, and extolled for its sharpness, archival durability and vibrant hues until its demise in 2009 . It was used to make Hollywood films for most of the 20th century, including 80 Best Picture Oscar winners, to record the Queen's coronation in 1953, and was used by Neil Armstrong to take close-ups on the lunar surface on the Apollo 11 mission.",

      "body": "<p>Achilleas Kallakis, the Mayfair real estate tycoon accused of building a \u00a3750m property empire on forged documents, has told a court he was a \"close personal friend\" of the late economist Lord Harris of High Cross, who provided a letter endorsing his business credentials.</p> <p>A letter purporting to come from Harris, best known as the former director of the Thatcherite thinktank the Institute of Economic Affairs, gave the late peer's address as Montpelier Street, Knightsbridge. The letter had been provided to Bristol &amp; West in advance of a large loan being granted.</p> <p>In truth, Kallakis told a jury at Southwark crown court, the Knightsbridge address was that of his co-defendant, Alexander Williams. Kallakis, who said Harris had been a friend of his father's, nevertheless insisted the letter was genuine. \"I had understood he [Harris] didn't want his personal details remitted to all and sundry at the bank.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/jan/13/kallakis-denies-knowledge-of-forgeries\" title=\"\">Kallakis and Williams deny 21 counts </a>relating to an alleged conspiracy to defraud and forgery between 2003 and 2008. The jury at Southwark crown court has already been told that the two men have a previous conviction from the same court \u2013 each under a different name \u2013 in relation to a separate forgery conspiracy in the mid-1990s.</p> <p>After securing multimillion-pound property loans from Bristol &amp; West, which is owned by Bank of Ireland, Kallakis sought financing for bigger commercial real estate deals and was introduced to Allied Irish Banks. He said the bank appeared very keen to do business with him, inviting him to \"a lot of little lunches\" where they were very pleasant but little of substance was discussed.</p> <p>\"They are anxious to get over to me that they were in the market, were awash with money, were anxious to lend.

      "bodyText": "Achilleas Kallakis, the Mayfair real estate tycoon accused of building a \u00a3750m property empire on forged documents, has told a court he was a \"close personal friend\" of the late economist Lord Harris of High Cross, who provided a letter endorsing his business credentials. A letter purporting to come from Harris, best known as the former director of the Thatcherite thinktank the Institute of Economic Affairs, gave the late peer's address as Montpelier Street, Knightsbridge. The letter had been provided to Bristol &amp; West in advance of a large loan being granted. In truth, Kallakis told a jury at Southwark crown court, the Knightsbridge address was that of his co-defendant, Alexander Williams. Kallakis, who said Harris had been a friend of his father's, nevertheless insisted the letter was genuine. \"I had understood he [Harris] didn't want his personal details remitted to all and sundry at the bank.\" Kallakis and Williams deny 21 counts relating to an alleged conspiracy to defraud and forgery between 2003 and 2008. The jury at Southwark crown court has already been told that the two men have a previous conviction from the same court \u2013 each under a different name \u2013 in relation to a separate forgery conspiracy in the mid-1990s. After securing multimillion-pound property loans from Bristol &amp; West, which is owned by Bank of Ireland, Kallakis sought financing for bigger commercial real estate deals and was introduced to Allied Irish Banks. He said the bank appeared very keen to do business with him, inviting him to \"a lot of little lunches\" where they were very pleasant but little of substance was discussed. \"They are anxious to get over to me that they were in the market, were awash with money, were anxious to lend. I think AIB was relatively new to the property finance world and were very, very anxious to build up their loan book.\" AIB eventually provided loans of \u00a3740m to fund property investments ultimately controlled by a family trust to which Kallakis, the nephew of Greek shipping magnate Pantelis \"Lou\" Kollakis, acted as chief adviser and his children were the beneficiaries. Earlier, the jury heard evidence from AIB bankers who admitted they had accepted hospitality from Kallakis, including a trip to the World Cup final in Germany in 2006 and to the Monaco Grand Prix. Some also told the court they had accepted a three-night trip to Mauritius, offered by Kallakis as a \"thank you\" for their work on one property deal. AIB ultimately seized many Kallakis properties and sold them, making a \u00a356m loss. The prosecution claimed that at the centre of the fraud were allegedly forged rental guarantees purporting to be provided by the Hong Kong-listed company Sun Hung Kai Properties. These bogus over-riding lease commitments from SHKP transformed bank valuations of properties targeted by Kallakis for acquisition, allowing him to access much larger loans.

      "bodyText": "Let's improve markets, not undermine them, said David Cameron on Thursday, because markets, when they work properly, \"create a direct link between contribution and reward, between effort and outcome\". What's more, Conservatives are best placed to pursue this vital work because they \"get\" the market and \"know its failings as well as its strengths\". So please tell us: are the bonuses that Royal Bank of Scotland may shortly award its top executives an example of fair rewards for hard work and success? Should we celebrate that John Hourican, head of RBS's investment bank, may collect \u00a34m? After all, his division has made \u00a310bn or so of profit in the past three years and the state's 83% stake in RBS would be even deeper under water without that. Yet, if we're supposed to be looking at outcomes, surely we can't ignore the ugly fact that RBS shares are worth half what we paid for them. What's the right response here? Rip up Hourican's contract or lock him into a new one? The prime minister ducked the RBS question, which focused on the potential \u00a31.5m bonus for the bank's chief executive, Stephen Hester. The point, though, is the same: appealing for a version of capitalism where effort is fairly rewarded is the easy bit; the tricky part is making it happen by identifying specific failures and remedies. The government will try to move on to the latter ground next week when the business secretary, Vince Cable, unveils his blueprint for reforming boardroom pay. \"We need to make the market work and we will do that by empowering shareholders and using the power of transparency,\" said Cameron. Fine principles in theory, but isn't it odd to invest so much faith in shareholders to make the market in the services of top executives work efficiently? A few institutions do indeed \"get it\", as Cameron might put it: Fidelity Worldwide received a name-check after speaking out this week against examples of \"over-generous\" and \"over-complex\" pay. But Fidelity's stance is not typical \u2013 it was speaking for itself, not its industry. Indeed, an alternative version of the passage of Cameron's speech about \"financial wizardry\" in the City might have included a pop at the fund management industry itself. The size of the commissions it earns from savers strike many outsiders as miraculous when set against the miserable returns suffered by stock market investors over the past decade. Are they a suitable case for a blast of competition to advance the cause of real capitalism? Don't bet on it: fund managers \u2013 the institutional shareholding club \u2013 currently represents the government's best hope of curbing boardroom excess elsewhere. And for a speech that called for \"more competition\" as a key ingredient in making a free market work properly, there was a glaring lack of detail on where the principle should be applied in practice. Ed Miliband has named his own targets \u2013 rail companies and energy companies were singled out on Thursday \u2013 and Cameron will be obliged to spell out his thinking in those and other fields if Thursday's speech is to bite. The Competition Commission has not been overburdened by referrals under the current government. Surely, it might be said, everyone can applaud Cameron's warm words for Nick Clegg's \"John Lewis economy\". Yes and no. Knocking down barriers that lie in the way of the creation of employee-owned businesses is a reasonable ambition, even if the chairman of John Lewis itself says the model \"is not right for everybody\". But Cameron is on slippery ground in encouraging staff to become shareholders in the companies they work for. Shares go down as well as up \u2013 as the majority owner of RBS should know \u2013 and it's a foolish employee who stakes his financial wellbeing on the success of his employer. In short, there were few surprises in Cameron's attempt to claim rights over that prized patch of political land called \"responsible capitalism\". He should be judged on what he identifies as cronyism in action and his broad-brush statement offered few clues. Were any crony capitalists frightened by the speech? Of course not: it was impossible to tell which vested interests Cameron wishes to confront.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "France and Spain have cleared major funding tests, steadying volatile markets and giving some much-needed cheer to the embattled eurozone. Paris and Madrid secured \u20ac13bn (\u00a310.8bn) of funding between them in bond auctions at significantly lower interest rates than last year, despite a downgrade by the ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor's last week that sparked fears of a run on the euro and the collapse of several banks. Stock markets rose on the news, with the FTSE 100 finishing the day up 38 points at 5741.15, while the German Dax rose 1%. The Paris CAC regained some of its losses in recent months with a 2% rise to 3328.94. Ireland added to the positive mood when it was described as the \"poster child\" for the International Monetary Fund and the European Union following a favourable review of its path to economic recovery. A joint report by the IMF, the European Central Bank (ECB) and the European Union, known as the \"troika\", said Ireland was on track to meet the targets its international partners had set down as part of the country's multibillion-euro bailout. Following their review of the nation's accounts, the troika concluded that budget cuts to the tune of 3.5% of Ireland's GDP had reduced the estimated general government deficit to about 10%. This, they said, was \"well within the programme target of 10.6%\". However, the troika added a note of caution, acknowledging that Ireland faced \"considerable challenges\" as domestic demand remained subdued, unemployment was high, and growth in its main trading partners was slowing. The atmosphere within the eurozone remains fraught, as talks between Greece and its creditors remain deadlocked. The head of the ECB, Mario Draghi, described the situation as fragile. \"We see a softening business cycle in Europe with significant downside risk. We also see some tentative signs \u2026 but I have to be quite cautious here \u2026 some tentative signs of stabilisation of economic activity at low levels,\" he said. \"All this is subject to downside risk: in other words, it can get worse.\" The bond auctions by France and Spain signalled that markets have largely shrugged off S&amp;P's warnings that Europe's situation has become more precarious. JP Morgan said in a report that markets were underestimating the power of the ECB to underwrite investments in sovereign bonds with its new lending scheme for banks. Eurozone banks have deposited more than \u20ac500bn of assets with the ECB in return for cash, which many of them have invested in sovereign bonds. Italian and Spanish banks have seized half of the total made available by the ECB as they seek to shore up their fragile finances. Analysts at JP Morgan said the move had proved effective as a way to encourage lending inside the eurozone while politicians agree a new fiscal pact. EU leaders are expected to meet in Brussels on 30 January to hammer out a deal for a bigger bailout fund and enhanced economic and fiscal rules in the eurozone. Richard McGuire, strategist at Rabobank in London, said: \"These results are bullish for both Spain and the broader periphery. For now the glass-half-full brigade have the upper hand.\" Draghi said: \"We start seeing also a fall of the longer-term part of the yield curve as well. I think that by and large, this measure has really avoided a serious funding crisis that European banks might have to face.\" Negotiators in Greece finished a second day of talks without agreement, with creditors holding out for a higher interest rate on outstanding loans after having accepted a 50% debt write-off. Athens has argued it is unable to pay more than 3.5%, but bondholders reject that as too low, one source told Reuters. A senior Greek official also played down speculation that a deal had been nearly pinned down, saying: \"Nothing has been concluded yet.\"",

According to VisitBritain, <a href=\"http://media.visitbritain.com/News-Releases/30-7-MILLION-OVERSEAS-VISITORS-EXPECTED-IN-2012-SPENDING-17-6-BILLION-ACROSS-THE-UK-8320.aspx\" title=\"\">the \u00a39.3bn Games are unlikely to trigger a surge in foreign visitors, with 2012 visitors expected to number 30.7 million, matching last year's total</a>.</p> <p>But already the impact on some traditional summer highlights is being felt. Thursday brought bad news for festival-goers and traders planning a trip to Herefordshire: the Big Chill festival, due to take place over the first weekend in August \u2013 right in the middle of the Olympics \u2013 will not go ahead as an outdoor event, though organisers say they may yet stage a smaller, indoor festival.</p> <p>\"I looked long and hard at moving the date so it didn't clash with the Olympics,\" said festival boss Melvin Benn, \"but [because of] our fans' desire to keep the date and an inability to find an alternative that worked, I plumped for maintaining the existing weekend. Sadly, the artist availability and confirmations we were achieving led me to conclude that I couldn't risk going ahead.\"</p> <p>VisitBritain \u2013 which has received <a href=\"http://www.visitbritain.org/mediaroom/pressreleases/27millfortourism.aspx\" title=\"\">an extra \u00a327m in funding from the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) to help drive up numbers</a> \u2013 admits the Games will put off some visitors to London, too. \"For some people, a busy and vibrant environment with a global spotlight on it is not where they want to go on holiday, which is fair enough,\" said a spokesman. \"It's displacement \u2013 people who would usually come here go somewhere else.\"</p> <p>The D-word is also cropping up at the <a href=\"http://www.bha.org.uk/\" title=\"\">British Hospitality Association</a>.</p> <p>\"There will clearly be some displacement,\" said aBHA spokesman, Miles Quest. \"How big this is, no one yet knows. There are some who believe it will be 'significant' \u2013 I'm not sure how they define significant \u2013 but the hotel industry believes the capital will be as busy as usual with the number of new visitors making up for those who stay away.\"</p> <p>The prospects for restaurants, said Quest, were equally tricky to forecast, as they depend on both international and domestic demand.</p> <p>\"Many of the visitors will be eating in the Games area so restaurants in the West End may suffer,\" he said.</p> <p>\"And if Britons stay at home to watch the Games on TV \u2013 rather than going out to eat as they might normally do \u2013 that will impact on restaurants far beyond London.\"</p> <p>Such fears, he said, had understandably left some restaurateurs feeling \"quite gloomy\" about the games.</p> <p>Mark Rubinstein, president of the <a href=\"http://www.solt.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Society of London Theatre</a>, is happy to shrug off Lloyd Webber's dark prognostications, pointing out that overall advance bookings across the West End are up this year compared with last year.</p> <p>But he admits the next few months will be challenging. \"It's going to be different and it's harder work, but it's a challenge that we're all up for,\" he said.</p> <p>\"There's no question that there's going to be a lot of visitors in London. I don't think it's going to be a bloodbath. I think we are going to see different audiences from the summer audience we would normally see in those weeks.\"</p> <p>Ensnaring those new audiences, he added, would be vital. \"There will be an awful lot of visitors whose primary reason for coming is the Games and we need to work harder as an industry to reach out to those people, to run promotions, to run initiatives that will make sure they get the information about what shows are on and how to book,\" he said.</p> <p>The organisers of the <a href=\"http://womad.org/\" title=\"\">Womad</a> festival, one of many big cultural events during the Olympic period, are laid back about clashing with the Games.</p> <p>\"Despite concerns that the Olympics might affect ticket sales, at this point, [they] are 30% up on where they were last year,\" said the festival's director, Chris Smith.</p> <p>\"For us it's very much business as usual, and the 'rest' that Glastonbury has taken is likely to be a much more significant factor than any Olympian extravaganza.\"</p> <p>Oddly, given VisitBritain's plateauing visitor predictions, the <a href=\"http://www.culture.gov.uk/\" title=\"\">DCMS</a> remains defiantly upbeat, insisting that the Games will also yield cultural dividends.</p> <p>\"Museums and galleries will benefit greatly from the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games,\" said a spokesman. \"Not only will there be a huge boost to tourism, but many are taking part in the <a href=\"http://www.london2012.com/cultural-olympiad\" title=\"\">Cultural Olympiad</a>, a UK wide celebration of arts, culture and heritage.\"</p> <p>But what about other sports? You may think it would have been best to call a halt while all eyes are on the Olympics but cricket, for one, will carry on regardless, with the second Test match against South Africa right in the middle of Olympic fortnight. \"Geographically, we've scheduled our matches to cater for the impact of the Olympics,\" said a spokesman for the England and Wales Cricket Board. \"We're very supportive of them coming to London.\"</p> <p>Pragmatism is the order of the day at the <a href=\"http://www.ltda.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Licensed Taxi Drivers Association</a>, which represents about 8,000 black-cab drivers.</p> <p>Its general secretary, Bob Oddy, said \"quite a proportion\" plan to take a holiday during the Games to avoid the predicted traffic problems.</p> <p>\"What we're really concerned about is there's going to be a lot of road closures, a lot of road restrictions, a lot of banned right turns that we would normally make,\" he said. \"Our real concern is getting around, to be honest.\"</p> <p>Oddy is also keen to dismiss speculation that the Olympics will prove a get-rich-quick fortnight for cabbies.</p> <p>Yes, the Games will obviously generate work around the venues, but that, he argues, will be offset by the number of regular cab users put off coming into the town centre.</p> <p>\"Personally, I think it'll be pretty much business as usual,\" he said, \"but there won't be the same spread of work.\"</p> <p>The mood in London's retail sector is more positive: <a href=\"http://www.newwestend.com/news/latest_news\" title=\"\">a report commissioned on behalf of 600 shops on Bond Street, Oxford Street and Regent Street predicts they will take an extra \u00a316.6m this year</a> as a direct result of the Games, with the Olympic year as a whole driving sales growth of 3.5% in the West End.</p> <p>But some reject the business-as-usual view. Tom Jenkins of the <a href=\"http://www.etoa.org/\" title=\"\">European Tour Operators Association</a>, says talk of a booming Olympic summer for hotels has led them to raise their prices and put off more visitors than they will attract.</p> <p>\"There's a misperception in the marketplace that the Olympic Games brings in hundreds of thousands of extra visitors,\" he said. \"But London has been largely dropped, certainly during the Games, from tour programmes for the American and Japanese market. What we're looking at during the Games period itself is a major drop in forward bookings, [which] are at least 50% down.\"</p> <p>Jenkins says the tourist sector must act now if it wants to salvage 2012. \"We urgently need to ensure that London is open for business because London will not fill up with Olympic visitors,\" he said.</p> <p>\"London needs to be full \u2013 principally of Londoners, who provide its lifeblood commercially \u2013 and it then needs to be full of as many normal tourists as we can get in. And these people will not turn up if they perceive normal London to be unavailable.\"</p> <p>VisitBritain, meanwhile, is keeping its fingers crossed, its eyes on the future, and hoping that 2012 will yet yield a golden Olympic legacy.</p> <p>\"We saw it with the royal wedding last year; we saw figures for April that were normal, but then over the next couple of months \u2013 especially June and July \u2013 we saw record figures for inbound tourism,\" said a spokesman.</p> <p>\"It's that global showcasing \u2013 it may not drive visitors exactly at that time, but it inspires them to visit at a later date.\"</p>",

The mood is partially explained by figures at the end of last month from the UK's government-funded tourism agency. According to VisitBritain, the \u00a39.3bn Games are unlikely to trigger a surge in foreign visitors, with 2012 visitors expected to number 30.7 million, matching last year's total. But already the impact on some traditional summer highlights is being felt. Thursday brought bad news for festival-goers and traders planning a trip to Herefordshire: the Big Chill festival, due to take place over the first weekend in August \u2013 right in the middle of the Olympics \u2013 will not go ahead as an outdoor event, though organisers say they may yet stage a smaller, indoor festival. \"I looked long and hard at moving the date so it didn't clash with the Olympics,\" said festival boss Melvin Benn, \"but [because of] our fans' desire to keep the date and an inability to find an alternative that worked, I plumped for maintaining the existing weekend. Sadly, the artist availability and confirmations we were achieving led me to conclude that I couldn't risk going ahead.\" VisitBritain \u2013 which has received an extra \u00a327m in funding from the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) to help drive up numbers \u2013 admits the Games will put off some visitors to London, too. \"For some people, a busy and vibrant environment with a global spotlight on it is not where they want to go on holiday, which is fair enough,\" said a spokesman. \"It's displacement \u2013 people who would usually come here go somewhere else.\" The D-word is also cropping up at the British Hospitality Association. \"There will clearly be some displacement,\" said aBHA spokesman, Miles Quest. \"How big this is, no one yet knows. There are some who believe it will be 'significant' \u2013 I'm not sure how they define significant \u2013 but the hotel industry believes the capital will be as busy as usual with the number of new visitors making up for those who stay away.\" The prospects for restaurants, said Quest, were equally tricky to forecast, as they depend on both international and domestic demand. \"Many of the visitors will be eating in the Games area so restaurants in the West End may suffer,\" he said. \"And if Britons stay at home to watch the Games on TV \u2013 rather than going out to eat as they might normally do \u2013 that will impact on restaurants far beyond London.\" Such fears, he said, had understandably left some restaurateurs feeling \"quite gloomy\" about the games. Mark Rubinstein, president of the Society of London Theatre, is happy to shrug off Lloyd Webber's dark prognostications, pointing out that overall advance bookings across the West End are up this year compared with last year. But he admits the next few months will be challenging. \"It's going to be different and it's harder work, but it's a challenge that we're all up for,\" he said. \"There's no question that there's going to be a lot of visitors in London. I don't think it's going to be a bloodbath. I think we are going to see different audiences from the summer audience we would normally see in those weeks.\" Ensnaring those new audiences, he added, would be vital. \"There will be an awful lot of visitors whose primary reason for coming is the Games and we need to work harder as an industry to reach out to those people, to run promotions, to run initiatives that will make sure they get the information about what shows are on and how to book,\" he said. The organisers of the Womad festival, one of many big cultural events during the Olympic period, are laid back about clashing with the Games. \"Despite concerns that the Olympics might affect ticket sales, at this point, [they] are 30% up on where they were last year,\" said the festival's director, Chris Smith. \"For us it's very much business as usual, and the 'rest' that Glastonbury has taken is likely to be a much more significant factor than any Olympian extravaganza.\" Oddly, given VisitBritain's plateauing visitor predictions, the DCMS remains defiantly upbeat, insisting that the Games will also yield cultural dividends. \"Museums and galleries will benefit greatly from the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games,\" said a spokesman. \"Not only will there be a huge boost to tourism, but many are taking part in the Cultural Olympiad, a UK wide celebration of arts, culture and heritage.\" But what about other sports? You may think it would have been best to call a halt while all eyes are on the Olympics but cricket, for one, will carry on regardless, with the second Test match against South Africa right in the middle of Olympic fortnight. \"Geographically, we've scheduled our matches to cater for the impact of the Olympics,\" said a spokesman for the England and Wales Cricket Board. \"We're very supportive of them coming to London.\" Pragmatism is the order of the day at the Licensed Taxi Drivers Association, which represents about 8,000 black-cab drivers. Its general secretary, Bob Oddy, said \"quite a proportion\" plan to take a holiday during the Games to avoid the predicted traffic problems. \"What we're really concerned about is there's going to be a lot of road closures, a lot of road restrictions, a lot of banned right turns that we would normally make,\" he said. \"Our real concern is getting around, to be honest.\" Oddy is also keen to dismiss speculation that the Olympics will prove a get-rich-quick fortnight for cabbies. Yes, the Games will obviously generate work around the venues, but that, he argues, will be offset by the number of regular cab users put off coming into the town centre. \"Personally, I think it'll be pretty much business as usual,\" he said, \"but there won't be the same spread of work.\" The mood in London's retail sector is more positive: a report commissioned on behalf of 600 shops on Bond Street, Oxford Street and Regent Street predicts they will take an extra \u00a316.6m this year as a direct result of the Games, with the Olympic year as a whole driving sales growth of 3.5% in the West End. But some reject the business-as-usual view. Tom Jenkins of the European Tour Operators Association, says talk of a booming Olympic summer for hotels has led them to raise their prices and put off more visitors than they will attract. \"There's a misperception in the marketplace that the Olympic Games brings in hundreds of thousands of extra visitors,\" he said. \"But London has been largely dropped, certainly during the Games, from tour programmes for the American and Japanese market. What we're looking at during the Games period itself is a major drop in forward bookings, [which] are at least 50% down.\" Jenkins says the tourist sector must act now if it wants to salvage 2012. \"We urgently need to ensure that London is open for business because London will not fill up with Olympic visitors,\" he said. \"London needs to be full \u2013 principally of Londoners, who provide its lifeblood commercially \u2013 and it then needs to be full of as many normal tourists as we can get in. And these people will not turn up if they perceive normal London to be unavailable.\" VisitBritain, meanwhile, is keeping its fingers crossed, its eyes on the future, and hoping that 2012 will yet yield a golden Olympic legacy. \"We saw it with the royal wedding last year; we saw figures for April that were normal, but then over the next couple of months \u2013 especially June and July \u2013 we saw record figures for inbound tourism,\" said a spokesman. \"It's that global showcasing \u2013 it may not drive visitors exactly at that time, but it inspires them to visit at a later date.\"",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Shoppers spent nearly \u00a38bn online in December, up 16.5% on the same time last year, as consumers rushed to buy goods on the internet despite difficult Christmas trading on the high street. According to research by Capgemini, the retail consultancy, a record \u00a368bn was spent online in 2011, up 16% on the previous year. Freddie George, an analyst at Seymour Pierce, said: \"More and more people are using the internet to do their shopping \u2013 but that won't grow the overall retail market, which is likely to contract this year.\" Online shopping accounts for 17% of the total UK retail market and is likely to increase with the relentless rise of mobile commerce. Growing numbers of retailers are launching or expanding online businesses, leading Capgemini to predict that total online retail sales will jump by 13% in 2012 to reach \u00a377bn. Capgemini's Chris Webster said: \"Strong online sales over Christmas went some way towards rescuing the performance of the year as a whole. During 2011 we saw continued pressure on sales as shoppers became savvier in looking for bargains. The influence of mobile is set to build in 2012 as consumers become familiar with shopping via tablet devices and smartphones, thanks in part to slicker websites and gadgets.\" The average percentage growth rate throughout the first half of 2011 was in the high teens, but dropped to the low teens during the second half as consumer confidence took another dive. Worst hit were travel and clothing, which saw a decline in year-on-year growth from 40% in December 2010 to just 12% in December 2011. Brands at the mid to low end of the market have reported poor sales in recent trading statements, while luxury brands are still turning huge profits. Webster said this was partly due to the spending power of middle-income Britons being squeezed by rising inflation and slow wage increases, while the wealthy continue to earn and spend. \"To cope with this changing landscape, retailers need to be more targeted in their marketing by using location based services,\" he said. The most popular items bought online were TV and audio equipment, laptops and games items, but customers also snapped up domestic appliances such as kettles, fryers, slow cookers, toasters and vacuum cleaners. UK consumers spent about \u00a3186m online on Christmas Day and \u00a3320m on Boxing Day. Despite the impact of the recession, these figures represent a 12% increase on 2010. James Roper, head of the Interactive Media in Retail Group, described the December results as \"incredibly impressive\" because growth for the same period in 2010 had been 25%, meaning 2011 had to climb from \"a very high base.\" Analysts said despite the fact that consumers are finding themselves with less and less disposable income, the e-retail market keeps defying the general retail trend to record double-digit growth. One broker said: \"Online is such an integral part of the shopping experience now that it generally plays at least some role in most purchases, whether through research and comparison or social media and product reviews.\" Online grocery companies have the most sophisticated operations, now offering shoppers the chance to specify their preferred delivery slots as a matter of routine, making it possible for them to take delivery when they get home from work or even early in the morning. This has transformed online food and drink shopping \u2013 and is essential given storage issues around perishable and frozen food. Capgemini said: \"We are forecasting growth of 13% moving into 2012, lower than our estimate for 2011, but it would still be an extremely positive performance given the economic climate and the fact that the online market has reached a degree of maturity now, meaning it can offer a really key contribution to help drive the economic recovery.\"",

      "body": "<p>Shoppers spent nearly \u00a38bn online in December, up 16.5% on the same time last year, as consumers rushed to buy goods on the internet despite difficult Christmas trading on the high street.</p> <p>According to research by Capgemini, the retail consultancy, a record \u00a368bn was spent online in 2011, up 16% on the previous year. Freddie George, an analyst at Seymour Pierce, said: \"More and more people are using the internet to do their shopping \u2013 but that won't grow the overall retail market, which is likely to contract this year.\"</p> <p>Online shopping accounts for 17% of the total UK retail market and is likely to increase with the relentless rise of mobile commerce. Growing numbers of retailers are launching or expanding online businesses, leading Capgemini to predict that total online retail sales will jump by 13% in 2012 to reach \u00a377bn.</p> <p>Capgemini's Chris Webster said: \"Strong online sales over Christmas went some way towards rescuing the performance of the year as a whole. During 2011 we saw continued pressure on sales as shoppers became savvier in looking for bargains. The influence of mobile is set to build in 2012 as consumers become familiar with shopping via tablet devices and smartphones, thanks in part to slicker websites and gadgets.\"</p> <p>The average percentage growth rate throughout the first half of 2011 was in the high teens, but dropped to the low teens during the second half as consumer confidence took another dive. Worst hit were travel and clothing, which saw a decline in year-on-year growth from 40% in December 2010 to just 12% in December 2011.</p> <p>Brands at the mid to low end of the market have reported poor sales in recent trading statements, while luxury brands are still turning huge profits. Webster said this was partly due to the spending power of middle-income Britons being squeezed by rising inflation and slow wage increases, while the wealthy continue to earn and spend.</p> <p>\"To cope with this changing landscape, retailers need to be more targeted in their marketing by using location based services,\" he said.</p> <p>The most popular items bought online were TV and audio equipment, laptops and games items, but customers also snapped up domestic appliances such as kettles, fryers, slow cookers, toasters and vacuum cleaners.</p> <p>UK consumers spent about \u00a3186m online on Christmas Day and \u00a3320m on Boxing Day.

      "bodyText": "The US investor Warren Buffett has given a boost to the embattled Tesco chief executive, Phil Clarke, by increasing his stake in the supermarket chain, which last week issued a shock profit warning. Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway investment firm increased its stake in the world's third biggest retailer from 3.21% to 5.08%, a regulatory filing showed on Thursday . Dated 13 January, the filing came a day after Tesco warned that trading profit for 2012/13 would be flat as the firm stepped up investment in its home market following its worst underlying Christmas sales performance for decades. Tesco shares fell by as much as 19% on 12 January and hit a 34-month low of 311p on Monday. The shares were up 6p to 327p at the close on Thursday. Share dealings by Buffet \u2013 nicknamed the Sage of Omaha after a string of investments made him among the world's three richest people \u2013 are closely watched in financial markets. After buying into Tesco in 2006, he has gradually increased his holding. Last year he caused a stir by saying the companyfirm should \"look hard\" at its loss-making Fresh &amp; Easy chain in the US, although he said he remained supportive of the business. On a trip to Japan in November, he said the global financial crisis was creating opportunities in European equities, adding: \"We bought Tesco earlier. I can think of a dozen euro stocks that are attractive \u2026 there are stocks I like and wonderful businesses. I could buy more Tesco if the price came down.\" Tesco shares had dropped earlier on Thursday after a negative note from Goldman Sachs, which warned that there would be further pressure on the sector's profitability. The note, the investment and banking firm said supermarkets would either reduce their land grab and expansion plans, which could improve cash flows and profits, or competition would increase with possible price wars and no slowdown in new openings. As Goldman has cut its 2013 earnings forecasts for Tesco, Morrisons and J Sainsbury, it is clear which the bank thinks is more likely. It said: \"The outlook for returns over the next two years has deteriorated and in particular we see expansion by Sainsbury and Morrisons as returns destructive. We see more compelling relative value in European food retail.\"",

Tim Geithner and the Obama administration have kept the show on the road and gained some momentum, creating more jobs than was expected and keeping growth in positive territory. But as the euro crisis continues, China slows down and Congress prepares to debate ending the government's fiscal stimulus measures, there is a chance their efforts will be undone. Philip Poole, global head of investment strategy at HSBC, says in a note on Thursday that trouble is on its way: \"The US earnings season that began last month has generally been disappointing. According to Bloomberg, in releases thus far, fewer S&amp;P 500 companies have beaten analyst earnings expectations than at any time over the last four years.\" And that is despite analysts already downgrading their forecasts in the latter half of last year. Figures have also shown that rail freight traffic fell sharply in January, and the unemployment claimant count remains stubbornly high. A three-pronged stimulus package, some of which dates back to the Bush era, was given a two-month lease of life in December. Will it be renewed by a Republican-dominated Congress keen to undermine president Obama's economic credibility? This could be crucial, and will determine whether the Federal Reserve adopts QE3 as an extra monetary stimulus. Not everyone perceives the situation to be so gloomy. Graham Turner at GFC Economics argues we should look at the US housing market, which has proved a huge drag on the economy after having acted as a stimulus for years when the Fed cut rates aggressively in response to the dotcom recession. He says: \"Housing will be the key for 2012. It's the recent trend that matters, and the positive showing for November (4.42m annualised [existing home sales] and the best since January) has been followed by a strong pending home sales report. Indeed, between September and November, the pending home sales index rose 18.5% (these numbers use a different methodology and have not been restated).\" David Blanchflower, the Dartmouth College economist who spent four years on the Bank of England's monetary policy committee, is also hopeful the recovery will continue, though he is more optimistic than some that Congress will renew stimulus plans and step back from a fight over raising the debt ceiling. He says: \"There is quite a contrast with Europe and the UK, especially on unemployment and employment, which have been surprisingly strong \u2013 and better than I or the Fed had expected. Similarly, consumer confidence has improved a lot here and reversed in UK/Europe. \"The renewal of the payroll tax cuts and increase in unemployment benefits for two months were good and suggest they will also be renewed. Similarly on the debt ceiling. \"The concern is that this is all temporary as the shocks from the euro debacle spreads. The concern of course is this is set to worsen.\" Any worsening in the outlook will bring a swift response from the Fed, he says, though this could make the political situation even more volatile. Tea Party Republicans will be forced to decide between the lesser of two evils, from their point of view: supporting fiscal props for the economy or cheap money supplied by the Fed.",

      "bodyText": "The news that Kodak has filed for Chapter 11 is rather like hearing about the death of a much-loved elderly relative. You've known for ages it was going to happen, but it's still a shock when it finally does. Kodak has teetered on the brink of collapse for the best part of a decade. Despite the continuous optimism of the CEO, Antonio Perez, the numbers simply never stacked up. Its new digital businesses kept growing, but didn't make any money. The old film business remained profitable, but shrank: shifting from consumers to professionals to diehards. Every so often, they would get a surge in revenue from some patents and everything would look a bit better, but this was only ever a temporary reprieve. At its heart, this was a business that had lost its previously formidable ability to generate cash, and that has ultimately led to this latest news. Kodak's success was based on a business model of genius. They sold film, they sold the chemicals you used to develop the film and then they sold the paper that the photographs from the film were printed out on. People often talk about the genius of the Gillette model where you sell cheap razors and charge a premium for the blades. But Kodak's model was better than that. Everything was premium. And thanks to great marketing, they managed that rare mix of being both profitable and much loved. The problem is that it was just too good, and as a result the phrase \"victim of its own success\" could have been created to describe Kodak. They got big and bureaucratic. When they needed to be moving faster, they got slower. When they needed to be radical, they were conservative. As a result, when digital technology challenged their perfect model, it was too easily dismissed by executives who had spent their entire career in the world of film, chemicals and paper. So, they were found wanting when Fuji launched a price war against them in the film market in the late 90s. When digital cameras made it to the mass market at the turn of the century, Kodak started a process of catch-up that has continued until the present day. It is no coincidence that many of the businesses that have experienced some of the greatest ravages as a result of digital technology had just experienced the most spectacularly successful periods in their corporate history. And, like Kodak, their success came from the continuous execution and optimisation of a single, successful business model. The music industry was rocked by the world of downloads just after the spectacular success of the launch of the CD. The newspaper industry was riding high on two decades of growth in classified advertising, only to see almost all of it disappear again within a decade. Directories around the world had gone from being profitable little sidelines of telecommunications firms to being floated and embarking on waves of international expansion. Now most of them are debt-ridden husks of their former selves, hoping that their digital businesses will grow quickly enough to make up for the increasingly rapid decline of Yellow Pages. And HMV, which has the Kodak-like tendency of teetering on the brink, also experienced the rough side of the digital revolution after two decades of spectacularly successful expansion. In all these cases, a generation of executives created or inherited successful business models and continued to tweak them as they were gradually being made irrelevant. Kodak had its moment. The problem was that it never really worked out what to do when the moment passed. Let that be the lesson. \u2022 Simon Waldman is the author of Creative Disruption: How to Shake Up Your Business in the Digital Age",

He claimed Labour feared standing up to the City and mistook the interests of big business for those of the economy. \"The City, which should have been a powerhouse of competition and creativity, became instead a byword for a sort of financial wizardry that left the taxpayer with all the risk, and a fortunate few with all of the rewards. \"So instead of popular capitalism we ended up with unpopular capitalism.\" He praised genuine reward, saying: \"When people take risks, with their own ideas, energy and money, when they succeed in a competitive market where anyone can come and knock them off their perch at any time, we should celebrate entrepreneurs who get rich in that way.\" But he warned: \"Large rewards for failure when companies are suffering means even less is left over for customers and shareholders.\" Without giving details, he said the business secretary, Vince Cable, would set out proposals next week, and he also promised to implement the Vickers report on banking designed to separate retail and investment banking.

    "fields": {
      "standfirst": "With government spending cuts in Europe threatening to produce a global recession, what can an 18th century philosopher, bees and modern economists tell us?", 
      "body": "<p>In his classic <a href=\"http://books.google.co.uk/books/about/The_fable_of_the_bees_or_Private_vices_p.html?id=oyRdAAAAMAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y\" title=\"\">Fable of the Bees: or Private Vices, Public Benefits</a> (1723), Bernard Mandeville, the Dutch-born British philosopher and satirist, described \u2013 in verse \u2013 a prosperous society (of bees) that suddenly chose to make a virtue of austerity, dropping all excess expenditure and extravagant consumption. What then happened?</p> <blockquote> The Price of Land and Houses falls; <br>Mirac'lous Palaces, whose Walls, <br>Like those of Thebes, were rais'd by Play <br>Are to be let; \u2026 <br>The building Trade is quite destroy'd <br>Artificers are not employ'd; \u2026 <br>Those, that remain'd, grown temp'rate strive <br>Not how to spend, but how to live \u2026 </blockquote> <p>That sounds a lot like what many advanced countries have been going through, after financial-crisis-induced austerity plans were launched, doesn't it? Is Mandeville a genuine prophet for our times?</p> <p>Fable of the Bees developed a wide following, and generated substantial controversy, which continues to this day. The austerity plans being adopted by governments in much of Europe and elsewhere around the world, and the curtailment of consumption expenditure by individuals as well, threaten to produce a global recession.</p> <p>But how do we know if Mandeville is right about austerity? His research method \u2013 a long poem about his theory \u2013 is hardly convincing to modern ears.</p> <p>Harvard economist Alberto Alesina recently summarised evidence concerning whether government deficit reduction \u2013 that is, expenditure cuts and/or tax increases \u2013 always induces such negative effects: \"The answer to this question is a loud no.\" Sometimes, even often, economies prosper nicely after the government's deficit is sharply reduced. Sometimes, just maybe, the austerity programme boosts confidence in such a way as to ignite a recovery.</p> <p>We have to examine the issue with some care, understanding that the issue that Mandeville raised is really a statistical one: the outcome of government deficit reduction is never entirely predictable, so we can ask only how likely such a plan is to succeed in restoring economic prosperity. And the biggest problem here is accounting for possible reverse causality.</p> <p>For example, if evidence of future economic strength makes a government worry about economic overheating and inflation, it might try to cool domestic demand by raising taxes and lowering government spending. If the government is only partly successful in preventing economic overheating, it might nonetheless appear to casual observers that austerity actually strengthened the economy.</p> <p>Likewise, the government's deficit might fall not because of austerity, but because the stock market's anticipation of economic growth fuels higher revenues from capital-gains tax. Once again, we would see what might appear, from looking at the government deficit, to be an austerity-to-prosperity scenario.</p> <h2>Analysis</h2> <p>Jaime Guajardo, Daniel Leigh, and Andrea Pescatori of the International Monetary Fund recently studied austerity plans implemented by governments in 17 countries in the last 30 years. But their approach differed from that of previous researchers. They focused on the government's intent, and looked at what officials actually said, not just at the pattern of public debt. They read budget speeches, reviewed stability programmes, and even watched news interviews with government figures.

      "bodyText": "In his classic Fable of the Bees: or Private Vices, Public Benefits (1723), Bernard Mandeville, the Dutch-born British philosopher and satirist, described \u2013 in verse \u2013 a prosperous society (of bees) that suddenly chose to make a virtue of austerity, dropping all excess expenditure and extravagant consumption. What then happened? The Price of Land and Houses falls; Mirac'lous Palaces, whose Walls, Like those of Thebes, were rais'd by Play Are to be let; \u2026 The building Trade is quite destroy'd Artificers are not employ'd; \u2026 Those, that remain'd, grown temp'rate strive Not how to spend, but how to live \u2026 That sounds a lot like what many advanced countries have been going through, after financial-crisis-induced austerity plans were launched, doesn't it? Is Mandeville a genuine prophet for our times? Fable of the Bees developed a wide following, and generated substantial controversy, which continues to this day. The austerity plans being adopted by governments in much of Europe and elsewhere around the world, and the curtailment of consumption expenditure by individuals as well, threaten to produce a global recession. But how do we know if Mandeville is right about austerity? His research method \u2013 a long poem about his theory \u2013 is hardly convincing to modern ears. Harvard economist Alberto Alesina recently summarised evidence concerning whether government deficit reduction \u2013 that is, expenditure cuts and/or tax increases \u2013 always induces such negative effects: \"The answer to this question is a loud no.\" Sometimes, even often, economies prosper nicely after the government's deficit is sharply reduced. Sometimes, just maybe, the austerity programme boosts confidence in such a way as to ignite a recovery. We have to examine the issue with some care, understanding that the issue that Mandeville raised is really a statistical one: the outcome of government deficit reduction is never entirely predictable, so we can ask only how likely such a plan is to succeed in restoring economic prosperity. And the biggest problem here is accounting for possible reverse causality. For example, if evidence of future economic strength makes a government worry about economic overheating and inflation, it might try to cool domestic demand by raising taxes and lowering government spending. If the government is only partly successful in preventing economic overheating, it might nonetheless appear to casual observers that austerity actually strengthened the economy. Likewise, the government's deficit might fall not because of austerity, but because the stock market's anticipation of economic growth fuels higher revenues from capital-gains tax. Once again, we would see what might appear, from looking at the government deficit, to be an austerity-to-prosperity scenario. Analysis Jaime Guajardo, Daniel Leigh, and Andrea Pescatori of the International Monetary Fund recently studied austerity plans implemented by governments in 17 countries in the last 30 years. But their approach differed from that of previous researchers. They focused on the government's intent, and looked at what officials actually said, not just at the pattern of public debt. They read budget speeches, reviewed stability programmes, and even watched news interviews with government figures. They identified as austerity plans only those cases in which governments imposed tax hikes or spending cuts because they viewed it as a prudent policy with potential long-term benefits, not because they were responding to the short-term economic outlook and sought to reduce the risk of overheating. Their analysis found a clear tendency for austerity programmes to reduce consumption expenditure and weaken the economy. That conclusion, if valid, stands as a stern warning to policymakers today. But critics, such as Valerie Ramey of the University of California at San Diego, think that Guajardo, Leigh, and Pescatori have not completely proven their case. It is possible, Ramey argues, that their results could reflect a different sort of reverse causality if governments are more likely to respond to high public-debt levels with austerity programmes when they have reason to believe that economic conditions could make the debt burden especially worrisome. That may seem unlikely \u2013 one would think that a bad economic outlook would incline governments to postpone, rather than accelerate, austerity measures. And, in response to her comments, the authors did try to account for the severity of the government's debt problem as perceived by the markets at the time that the plans were implemented, finding very similar results. But Ramey could be right. One would then find that government spending cuts or tax hikes tend to be followed by bad economic times, even if the causality runs the other way. Ultimately, the problem of judging austerity programmes is that economists cannot run fully controlled experiments. When researchers tested Prozac on depressed patients, they divided their subjects randomly into control and experimental groups, and conducted many trials. We cannot do that with national debt. Lessons So do we have to conclude that historical analysis teaches us no useful lessons? Do we have to return to the abstract reasoning of Mandeville and some of his successors, including John Maynard Keynes, who thought that there were reasons to expect that austerity would produce depressions? There is no abstract theory that can predict how people will react to an austerity programme. We have no alternative but to look at the historical evidence. And the evidence of Guajardo and his co-authors does show that deliberate government decisions to adopt austerity programmes have tended to be followed by hard times. Policymakers cannot afford to wait decades for economists to figure out a definitive answer, which may never be found at all. But, judging by the evidence that we have, austerity programmes in Europe and elsewhere appear likely to yield disappointing results. Copyright: Project Syndicate, 2012.",

The Treasury is in the midst of a consultation on whether up to 15 banks \u2013 not just the high street banks \u2013 should publish pay details of the top eight bankers who do not sit on the board. This work builds upon the Project Merlin disclosures of last year \u2013 the ones that forced Barclays to concede that its top five bankers had been handed \u00a3110m in 2010, when three year performance related deals paid out. As it stands, there is not yet an agreement about the information that should be published for 2011 by the high street banks or by the wider pool of investment houses, such as Goldman Sachs, that the government wants to include. Pay information is usually published in annual reports. Last year, the banks released pay details of top five bankers outside the boardroom in this format. Sources reckon it is unlikely that any new framework for disclosure will be in place in time for this year's round of annual reports by the UK's banks.

This would suggest that the high street banks \u2013 HSBC, Barclays, Lloyds Banking Group and Royal Bank of Scotland \u2013 can publish their annual reports this year with the scant traditional information about boardroom pay as well as the new regulatory requirement to publish aggregate information about how much \"code staff\" \u2013 those bankers taking and managing risk \u2013 are paid. This is not to say that more disclosure will not come by the end of the year. But it is possible, that unless the government reaches a friendly agreement with high street banks, annual reports for 2011 could contain less information about pay than in 2010. A Treasury spokesperson said: \"Our proposals will require the largest UK banks and UK banking operations of large foreign banks, to publish remuneration reports every year, including for the 2011 \u2013 12 financial year.

In what is being described as \"co-ops in a box\", he will set out measures to make it easier legally to create them.</p> <p>Cameron will say that Conservatives instinctively abhor monopolies and protectionism, and regard transparency as the best antidote to bad company behaviour.</p> <p>The prime minister is not expected to reveal an array of new policies, but is setting out his views before announcements next Tuesday by the business secretary, Vince Cable, on executive pay and proposals to address City short-termism.</p> <p>Cable received a boost on Wednesday for his proposal to give shareholders more powers to throw out executive pay deals. City fund manager Fidelity put its weight behind his idea for a binding vote on remuneration reports.</p> <p>The government's potential intervention comes as the US banks, all big employers in the City, report their results for 2011, when the eurozone crisis dampened activity and hit profits.</p> <p>Goldman Sachs chief Lloyd Blankfein blamed \"global macroeconomic concerns\" for a 26% fall in full-year revenues to $28.8bn \u2013 down 26% \u2013 and a near halving in earnings to $4.4bn.</p> <p>Goldman used more of its revenue (42%) to pay its 33,000 staff in 2011, even after cutting 7% of the workforce, or 2,400 jobs. The total payout per staff member of $367,000 \u2013 a figure that includes salaries, bonuses, equity awards and benefits \u2013<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/jan/19/goldman-sachs-bankers-pay-bonuses\" title=\"\"> was down 15% on the the previous year</a>. The actual amount set side to pay staff was down 21% at $12.2bn.</p> <p>David Viniar, Goldman's finance director, maintained \"discretionary\" bonuses were down \"considerably more than revenues\".</p> <p>The company recently disclosed more about its pay deals in the UK as a result of rules set out by the Financial Services Authority requiring firms to publish pay for \"code staff\" \u2013 those taking or managing risk. Regulatory filings for Goldman Sachs Group Holdings (UK) show that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/blog/2012/jan/16/goldman-sachs-pay-top-london-staff\" title=\"\">it had 95 code staff in 2010</a> who had an average pay deal of $6.2m (\u00a34m) in 2010 \u2013 and had a further $595m awarded in a one-off mid-year award of shares in 2010.</p> <p>In his speech, Cameron will also argue that the triumph of the City under Labour was due to Tony Blair and Gordon Brown's determination to create a form of equality through tax credits funded by the excess profits of the City. He will argue for what he sees as a deeper form of social mobility and fairness created through a better educated and skilled workforce.</p> <p>A key test for the speech will be whether he repeats <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/jan/31/david-cameron-capitalism\" title=\"\">his Davos attack on a \"winner takes all culture\"</a> that ends up with the poorest half of the world's population owning less than 1% of the world's wealth.</p>",

Among Cameron's ideas are ways to support co-operatives. In what is being described as \"co-ops in a box\", he will set out measures to make it easier legally to create them. Cameron will say that Conservatives instinctively abhor monopolies and protectionism, and regard transparency as the best antidote to bad company behaviour. The prime minister is not expected to reveal an array of new policies, but is setting out his views before announcements next Tuesday by the business secretary, Vince Cable, on executive pay and proposals to address City short-termism. Cable received a boost on Wednesday for his proposal to give shareholders more powers to throw out executive pay deals. City fund manager Fidelity put its weight behind his idea for a binding vote on remuneration reports. The government's potential intervention comes as the US banks, all big employers in the City, report their results for 2011, when the eurozone crisis dampened activity and hit profits. Goldman Sachs chief Lloyd Blankfein blamed \"global macroeconomic concerns\" for a 26% fall in full-year revenues to $28.8bn \u2013 down 26% \u2013 and a near halving in earnings to $4.4bn. Goldman used more of its revenue (42%) to pay its 33,000 staff in 2011, even after cutting 7% of the workforce, or 2,400 jobs. The total payout per staff member of $367,000 \u2013 a figure that includes salaries, bonuses, equity awards and benefits \u2013 was down 15% on the the previous year. The actual amount set side to pay staff was down 21% at $12.2bn. David Viniar, Goldman's finance director, maintained \"discretionary\" bonuses were down \"considerably more than revenues\". The company recently disclosed more about its pay deals in the UK as a result of rules set out by the Financial Services Authority requiring firms to publish pay for \"code staff\" \u2013 those taking or managing risk. Regulatory filings for Goldman Sachs Group Holdings (UK) show that it had 95 code staff in 2010 who had an average pay deal of $6.2m (\u00a34m) in 2010 \u2013 and had a further $595m awarded in a one-off mid-year award of shares in 2010. In his speech, Cameron will also argue that the triumph of the City under Labour was due to Tony Blair and Gordon Brown's determination to create a form of equality through tax credits funded by the excess profits of the City. He will argue for what he sees as a deeper form of social mobility and fairness created through a better educated and skilled workforce. A key test for the speech will be whether he repeats his Davos attack on a \"winner takes all culture\" that ends up with the poorest half of the world's population owning less than 1% of the world's wealth.",

      "bodyText": "Britain faces a difficult challenge over the next decade as it slowly adjusts to an economy less dependent on debt-fuelled growth, according to new research by consultancy McKinsey. An international study found Britain had the highest level of debt after Japan, that the debt had risen over the past three years to more than 500% of national output, and that on current trends it would take until 2020 for UK households to return debt levels to the pre-bubble trend. \"Overall, the United Kingdom needs to steer a difficult course: reduce government deficits and encourage household debt reduction \u2013 without limiting GDP growth\", the study said. In a 60-page report comparing major economies since 2008, McKinsey finds that, while the US is making progress in the \"great deleveraging\", as economists call it, increased borrowing by financial firms pushed up Britain's debt from 487% of GDP in 2008 to 507% by the middle of 2011. In 2003, before the credit binge, it was 300%. In 2008, it stood at 487% of GDP. \"While the largest component of US debt is household borrowing and the largest share of Japanese debt is government debt, the financial sector accounts for the largest share of debt in the UK,\" it says. \"Although UK banks have significantly improved their capital ratios, non-bank financial companies have increased debt issuance since the crisis.\" In the US, much of the improvement in households' debt position has come through foreclosures in the housing market, while McKinsey says many lenders in Britain have shown more forebearance with homeowners in negative equity and that this might be disguising the true extent of the mortgage debt problem. US households have reduced their debt-to-disposable-income ratio by 15 percentage points, more than in any other major country, while UK consumers have increased their borrowing slightly. The report says this burden could leave the economy vulnerable when interest rates have to rise to more normal levels from their current record low of 0.5%. Charles Dumas, of consultancy Lombard Street Research, says the main reason the US has made more progress in paying down its debts is its better economic performance. \"They've had more growth: they've had a better recovery.\" Britain's close proximity to the crisis-hit eurozone would put the brakes on efforts to kickstart the economy over the next 12 months. McKinsey estimates household debt in the US could reach sustainable levels in \"two years or so,\" while in the UK, the process will take \"many more years.\" Comparing the UK with Sweden and Finland, which each suffered had a credit-fuelled boom followed by a financial crisis and deep recession in the late-1980s and early-1990s, McKinsey says the UK has a long way to go before it can start to expand strongly again. Spain, which has suffered a devastating housing boom and bust, is also lagging behind, according to the consultancy, which says it could be a decade before either country gets its debts back to the \"pre-bubble trend\".",
