A monitor installed by the US Department of Justice found that deep-rooted cultural problems inside Britain\u2019s largest bank continue to exist despite the efforts of the new management, led by chief executive Stuart Gulliver, to reform the way the bank operates.

The monitor does not believe this is the result of bad faith or lack of commitment by HSBC group\u2019s senior leadership, but does believe that HSBC group can \u2013 and must \u2013 do more\u201d. In the US, there was \u201ccombativeness, overblown complaints about factual inaccuracy, and a basic lack of cooperativeness\u201d in some instances. As a result the head of the US business is being moved and bonuses cut by 50%.

A review of that 1,000-page report filed in the US courts by the Department of Justice found that while senior executives at HSBC were attempting to improve the culture, this was not the case in other parts of the business. \u201cNotwithstanding the attitude of HSBC group\u2019s senior executives, the monitor observed other indicators that some of HSBC group\u2019s historical cultural deficiencies continue to pervade its operations today,\u201d the report said.

Therefore, we should expect to have more insightful and critical audits,\u201d the memo said.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s late in London, and inching towards bedtime in Greece, so here\u2019s a quick recap. Greece has submitted its most comprehensive reform plan yet to its creditors, but has yet to unlock any bailout funds. Athens proposed a 26-page list of reforms today, from tax evasion measures to a new bad bank to help clean out its financial system. It warned that action was \u2018urgently needed\u2019, to preserve the viability of the eurozone. The plan was discussed by eurozone deputy finance ministers this afternoon (these charts outline the main measures) Greek sources say there was progress, while eurozone insiders say the call was simply to \u2018take stock\u2019. But hopes are fading for a breakthrough next week, with officials in Brussels and Athens both suggesting that finance chiefs might not meet until 24 April. Earlier, Greece had denied that it would be unable to meet a \u20ac430m repayment to the IMF next week, unless it is given more help by its creditors. And in the last few minutes, the ECB has apparently extended Greece a little more liquidity assistance to help its banks stay afloat. For more details of the day, including some protests in Greece, check out the lunchtime summary: Thanks, and goodnight. GW Some late breaking news....the European Central Bank has agreed to raise the emergency liquidity on offer to Greek banks by another \u20ac700m. That\u2019s quite a small increase, suggesting the ECB is keeping the pressure on Greece to reach a deal. Greece\u2019s government has also proposed setting up a \u2018bad bank\u2019 to handle the bad loans that are clogging up its financial system. It warns that there are \u201cCritical Deficiencies\u201d in the banking sector today, in today\u2019s 26-page list of reforms: The Greek banking sector has been marred by clientelism, by too close a link with the mass media and the political systems (through the provision of loans on non banking principles) and, lastly, by lending practices that were either too tight or too loose. The economic crisis has in addition created a vast amount of NPLs [non-performing loans] that impedes credit creation. And here\u2019s the proposed reform strategy: Broad and deep structural reforms aimed at ensuring financial stability, appropriate credit expansion and governance that constitutes a significant departure from suspect practices of the recent and not too recent past. The Greek government has planned a broad reform programme in order to address critical deficiencies of the banking sector, through the establishment of strong institutions and the introduction of solid processes for the functional supervision of the banks that ensure financial stability, a robust banking sector and banks that are run on sound 8 commercial banking principles. Dealing with the very high levels of NPLs is a top priority for consolidating the banks and restarting the economy. The government wishes to explore the possibility, in conjunction with the institutions, of a capital asset management company to be created towards dealing with NPLs utilizing the remaining buffer of the HFSF. (that\u2019s the Hellenic Financial Stability Fund) Greece\u2019s government is proposing to raise the minimum wage...however, it also predicts that the fiscal impact in 2015 and 2016 will be \u201cnegligible\u201d The reforms plan states: Proposed reforms will be introduced in stages: unifying the minimum wages of \u201cwhite\u201d and \u201cblue collar\u201d workers, abolishing wage differentiation based on age, and gradually increasing the minimum wage after consultations with the social partners. The section on Greek privatizations begins with a pop at the failure of the past: The initial goal for revenues from privatizations was \u20ac50 billion between 2011 and 2016, with a \u20ac5 billion target for 2011, \u20ac10 billion for 2012 and \u20ac5 billion for 2013. In practice, proceeds from privatizations amounted to \u20ac1.6 billion in 2011, no revenues in 2012 and \u20ac1 billion in 2013. Seldom has a privatization program failed so spectacularly! The new government is proposing to consider future privatizations on a \u201ccase-by-case basis\u201d. Existing contracts \u201cwill be honoured\u201d, but Greece will also use all legal powers to guarantee an equity stake in privatised firms, and protection for workers. But will that be enough to placate critics in the Syriza party? Greece\u2019s list of economic reforms contains some firm pledges to crack down on tax evasion. The first item is called \u201cIntensification of audits on lists of bank transfers and offshore entities\u201d, and is said to raise \u20ac725-\u20ac875 million in 2015. \u20ac1 billion from 2016 onwards. It also includes plans for a \u201cVAT lottery scheme\u201d, where consumers who pay the sales tax can enter a prize draw. A \u201cWealth database-registry\u201d to prevent rich Greeks hiding their assets is planned. And the Finance Ministry is also proposing to stop tax evasion by self-employed people through \u201ca point of sale electronic application that will record every incoming customer and transfer real-time notifications to the authorities\u201d. Agence France-Presse have also heard that eurozone finance chiefs aren\u2019t likely to told another meeting about Greece soon. This suggests that Greece\u2019s reform plan, although more comprehensive than before, hasn\u2019t persuaded creditors to release bailout funds: [Today\u2019s conference call] was just to take stock. There won\u2019t be any developments in coming days,\u201d a source close to the discussions told AFP. \u201cWe will continue with technical work in Athens. There is no Eurogroup meeting in sight.\u201d Over in Athens officials are denying that today\u2019s teleconference with with the euro working group went badly. But they are also saying April is likely to be a month packed with negotiations ... suggesting that a reform-for-cash deal is unlikely to be found at least until the next scheduled euro group of euro area finance ministers on April 24. Helena Smith reports: Government sources are saying another Euro working group will be held next Wednesday - traditionally regarded as the Holy Week by Greek Orthodox faithful who will celebrate Easter a week later than the Catholic communion on April 12. \u201cToday\u2019s teleconference took place in an unexpectedly good climate even if there was no decision to dispense [bailout] funds,\u201d one official said: \u201cThere is a growing sense of convergence even if the talks are difficult.\u201d Auditors were pouring over the Greek government\u2019s proposed reforms in minute detail, they said, adding that \u201cthe whole of April\u201d was likely to be taken up with negotiations. Greece\u2019s government has also argued that its reform programme could deliver a chunky primary surplus. Open Europe flags up the details: So, how much progress was made on today\u2019s eurozone conference call? One eurozone official has told Reuters that there is been \u201cprogress and convergence\u201d, but there is still \u201cquite some work that needs to be done\u201d to reach a successful conclusion. So, we\u2019re not there yet. Greece has also warned that growth in 2015 and 2016 will be weaker than previously expected, confirming that its economy has deteriorated in recent months. The Ministry of Finance now only expects growth of 1.4% this year, down from 2.9% estimated in the 2015 budget, rising to 2.9% in 2016 (down from 3.7%). Unemployment is also expected to be higher than planned, this year and next year. Here\u2019s the chart from today\u2019s report: Greece also expects to only post a primary surplus of just 1.2% of GDP for 2015, down from an original forecast of 3%. Greece has also warned its creditors that the \u201cviability\u201d of the EU, and the single currency, is at stake. The introduction of the 26-page list of reforms presented today states that: The Hellenic Republic considers itself to be a proud and indefeasible member of the European Union and an irrevocable member of the Eurozone. Yet the viability of that Union, and especially of the common currency, is now in question, in the minds of many Greek citizens as it is in the minds of many among our European partners. The question before us all, as Europeans, is whether the European Union can rise to the challenge before it. It is necessary now, without further delay to turn a corner on the mistakes of the past and to forge a new relationship between member states, a relationship based on solidarity, resolve, mutual respect and a new hope for common progress. To that end, it is now urgent that the books be closed on the past programme with the rapid conclusion of the Final Review, so that Greece and her partners can proceed to negotiate and to launch a new partnership and a new model for development and growth in Greece. The reforms plan submitted by Greece today could raise between \u20ac4.6bn and \u20ac6bn of revenue (according to Athens\u2019 calculations, anyway). Here\u2019s the details: It also includes around \u20ac1.5bn in privatisation revenue (as Helena reported earlier). But the plan also includes new expenditure, including \u20ac600m to raise pensions (as demanded by protesters today). Peter Spiegel of the Financial Times has obtained the list of reforms which Greece has proposed to its creditors today. It\u2019s 26 pages long, covering taxation, privatisations, Greece\u2019s public sector, its labour market and healthcare, among others. The Greek goverment says it is a \u201ccomprehensive list\u201d of policy reforms, meeting its commitments to its creditors and to the Greek people, and urged its lenders to respond quickly, and positively. The government requests a speedy and successful conclusion of the Final Review on the basis of this list, so that shortterm funding issues may be resolved and the current crippling economic and financial uncertainties brought to an end. This is an urgent and necessary precondition for the success of the economic and reform program. But Peter, having perused it, reckons it may not go far enough. Financial Times: Greece submits new list of reforms to eurozone He writes: The new reform measures are similar to Friday\u2019s initial effort and fail to address several issues that bailout monitors have insisted on, including an overhaul of the Greek pension system and further labour market liberalisation. Indeed, the proposal appears to reverse past reforms in several of these areas. The document includes \u20ac1.1bn in new spending this year, more than half of it reinstating a so-called \u201c13th pension\u201d \u2014 an extra months\u2019 pay \u2014 for low-income pensioners. The document suggests that change would add \u20ac600m this year. It also would suspend a so-called \u201czero deficit clause\u201d that would force further cuts to state pensions; the measure would add another \u20ac326m this year. And while the document includes five separate measures under the heading \u201clabour market reforms\u201d, they include a gradual increase in the minimum wage and strengthening collective bargaining \u2014 both measures that would effectively undo reforms adopted earlier in the rescue programme. Still, the document includes several concessions to eurozone authorities, particularly in the area of privatisations. Some government ministers from the far left of the governing Syriza party have publicly stated that all privatisation of state assets would come to an end. Peter has also kindly uploaded the whole document, here: More to follow.... With delicious timing, the European Central Bank has just advertised for a Greek translator.... The Greek government has provided further details of its reform plans to lenders today, in an attempt to unlock bailout funds. Helena Smith reports that: Greek officials say in addition to \u20ac3.7bn worth of fiscal measures the left-led government is proposing, privatisations worth \u20ac1.5 bn in 2015 have also been outlined in the package the finance ministry has drafted. The operation and management of 14 regional airports (concessions long sought after by Germany) has been included in the privatisations. Reuters is also reporting that Greece fleshed out its propose reforms, but the two sides are still divided over pensions and labour reform. Over in Athens, officials say a campaign of rumour, innuendo and deliberate leaks is being waged against the new government. Helena Smith, our correspondent, reports: Greek officials are finding it increasingly hard to hide their exasperation with tactics they say are deliberately aimed at undermining Athens\u2019 new leftist-led government. \u201cA campaign of rumour, innuendo and deliberate leaks is being waged against us,\u201d said one well-placed source. \u201cThey keep saying \u2018the Greeks are not well prepared, they haven\u2019t done their homework, their proposals are vague\u2019; all of which are grotesque and preposterous lies. The Greek side has never been as well prepared and the issue really is not whether they agree with our figures but whether they want an agreement.\u201d Today\u2019s suggestions that Greece was about to withhold the \u20ac450m payment to the IMF on April 9 was part and parcel of the campaign, insiders feel [even though the quotes did actually come from a Greek minister....GW] \u201cWhat we are seeing is an intent to stall the situation so that there is an accident in our banking system and liquidity becomes so constrained we are unable to pay an installment or one of the banks is forced to shut down,\u201d another official said. \u201cThe banking system is at risk, outflows are growing, non-performing loans are mounting. What they are doing is criminal. The February 20th agreement was supposed to give us four months of financial stability and instead they are using it to asphyxiate us.\u201d Today\u2019s euro working group meeting was important, Greek officials said, because it would signal whether creditors were prepared to be conciliatory. Thomas Wieser, an Austrian who presides over the group, is believed to be more aligned to the school of hardliners lead by Germany finance minister Wolfgang Schauble. Our official adds: \u201cThe Euro working group prepares the ground for the euro group so if anything it would be surprising if there were a breakthrough....It seems they want to push us to the brink of Grexit, squeeze us to our last drop of blood and breath in the hope that they can get just a little bit more out of us.\u201d Greece\u2019s strength lay in its proposals \u2013 a 52 page document that the government was prepared to disclose if necessary. The anti-austerity coalition was sticking to its guns and refusing to reduce pensions, make cuts or forge ahead with mass lay-offs. Tensions remain high, judging by this final quote: \u201cFrom the start we made that clear. The whole aim is to defeat this government. If they see us retreating they will wipe us out. From time of the Roman legions that is how the Germans have worked. We are not going to do them the favour.\u201d HS Heads-up: Eurozone deputy finance ministers have just ended their conference call about Greece. Euronews\u2019s Efi Koutsokosta reports that the Greek finance minister was also on the call: The Greek stock market has fallen again today, as the uncertainty and occasional eyebrow-raising headlines jangled nerves. The main ATG index fell 1.3% by the close of trading. The very fact that Greece could threaten to withhold its IMF repayment shows the need for a proper process to handle debt defaults. So argues Eric LeCompte, Executive Director of the religious debt relief organization Jubilee USA Network. LeCompte writes: \u201dWe\u2019re watching a poker match between Greece, the IMF and the European Union. The stakes couldn\u2019t be higher with the lives of millions of ordinary people on the line. \u201cThis is more proof that we need a global bankruptcy process with rules that are above board. We can\u2019t be playing poker with people\u2019s lives.\u201d And just in case any Greek ministers are reading, and considering leaving the IMF empty-handed next Thursday, here\u2019s what would happen next: Greek government bonds have weakened today, pushing up the yields on its short and long-term debt. Over in the City, Steve Collins has kindly tweeted the details: The Athens government has moved swiftly to deny that it won\u2019t meet its \u20ac450m repayment to the IMF next week unless its gets a bailout payment quickly. A government spokesman has denied Spiegel\u2019s story, and insisted that it still hopes for a \u2018positive\u2019 outcomes to the current situation. Reuters has the details: GREEK GOVT SPOKESMAN DENIES PLAN TO DELAY PAYMENT TO IMF ON APRIL 9 UNLESS IT GETS FUNDS FROM LENDERS GREEK GOVT SPOKESMAN SAYS GOVERNMENT TO CONTINUE SPECIFYING REFORMS, HOPES FOR POSITIVE OUTCOME AT A EUROGROUP MEETING Greek journalist Efi Efthimiou also has the denial: That Spiegel story suggesting Greece might not repay the IMF next week has sent ripples through the financial markets. Nikos Voutzis\u2019s comments have left traders edgy that the Greek crisis may be flaring up again.... The crisis just took another twist. Germany\u2019s Spiegel news magazine is reporting that Greece might not meet the \u20ac450m loan repayment due to the IMF next week. Greek Interior Minister Nikos Voutzis has apparently told the paper that, without fresh bailout aid, Athens would be forced to miss this payment. Voutzis also warned that Greece only has enough money to last until mid-April, and would prioritise public sector wages and pensions if its creditors fail to release some of the \u20ac7.2bn aid currently being withheld. The story is online here (in German). Reuters has snapped the key points: GREEK INTERIOR MINSTER TELLS GERMANY\u2019S SPIEGEL ONLINE IF INTERNATIONAL CREDITORS SEND NO FURTHER FUNDS TO ATHENS BY APRIL 9, GREECE WON\u2019T REPAY IMF ON TIME GREEK INTERIOR MINSTER TELLS GERMANY\u2019S SPIEGEL ONLINE WE SHOULD AGREE TO POSTPONE REPAYMENT TO AVOID DEFAULTING ON DEBT GREEK INTERIOR MINSTER TELLS GERMANY\u2019S SPIEGEL ONLINE WE HAVE SUFFICIENT MONEY UNTIL MID APRIL Being late with an IMF repayment isn\u2019t unprecedented -- Sudan, Zimbabwe and Somalia have all missed payments. But it would be a major event, raising a lot of concern over Greece\u2019s ability to meet other obligations and sending Grexit fears soaring., It could also potentially trigger \u2018cross-default\u2019 clauses in other Greek bonds, if Greece doesn\u2019t meet the payment within a month. The Open Europe thinktank have just released a good analysis on the issue. Here\u2019s a flavour: One of the biggest problems for Greece is that it is still working with the Fund and relies on its sign off (as part of the \u2018institutions\u2019) to get its current review completed and therefore funding released. The response of the fund on the ground will therefore be important. Of course, the fund finds itself in a bit of a circular position. It is unlikely to get paid if it does not approve Greece\u2019s review, but how can it approve the review if it is not getting paid?.... Gap with creditors grows, reputation harmed: Linked to the above, given that not paying the IMF is usually a course of action reserved only for war torn countries or those on the fringes of the international system, not to mention severly underdeveloped economies, Greece could see its reputation severely dented. Furthermore, it is possible that Greece\u2019s creditors will see that Greece has decided to pay wages and pensions first rather than meet its commitments to them. Whether or not this is a fair assessment, this could drive further animosity between the two sides. A brief recap: Eurozone deputy finance ministers will hold a conference call shortly to discuss the state of play around Greece\u2019s reform plan. Germany\u2019s finance ministry has already predicted that the call won\u2019t yield much, though. Despite five days of talks in Brussels (which ended yesterday), we still don\u2019t have a list of solid reforms that could persuade creditors to hand over bailout cash. Officially, Greece\u2019s government remains upbeat. Economy Minister George Stathakis set the scene this morning by telling Skai TV that the two sides will agree a package of reforms next week. He said: \u201cThe agreement will close on (Greek Orthodox) Easter week. But the word from Brussels is that a deal is still far away, with eurozone finance ministers not expected to meet until late April. And the uncertainty is weighing on Greek bonds, pushing up its borrowing costs while other eurozone members benefit from lower yields: Greek pensioners have rallied in Athens, urging the government to reverse cuts to pensions and healthcare. Photos here. And a group of protesters have been arrested after invading the courtyard of the Greek parliament, in a show of solidarity with anarchists and hunger striking prisoners. The latest economic data has shown that the political uncertainty gripping Greece is hurting its economy. Factory output fell in March for the third month running, with export orders weakening. The rest of the eurozone did better, though, with manufacturing growing at its fastest rate in 10 months. Britain\u2019s factories also posted solid growth last month,. but this has been overshadowed by confirmation that UK productivity is stuck in its worst rut since 1948. We\u2019ve not seen so much of Yanis Varoufakis, recently -- hopefully he\u2019s been hard at work writing that economic reform plan. But Greece\u2019s finance minister has just appeared on Twitter, to plug a \u2018witty\u2019 joke about Greece moving to Bitcoin. No worse than Yanis\u2019s idea of turning tourists into undercover tax snoopers, I guess. Incidentally, it\u2019s not been a great April Fool\u2019s Day for the European Central Bank\u2019s media chief, Michael Steen. Germany\u2019s FAZ newspaper told its readers we could all dine at the ECB\u2019s new restaurant. For reservations, phone Michael! (no don\u2019t, he\u2019s had a bad morning) Interesting.... Germany\u2019s finance ministry has confirmed that eurozone deputy finance ministers will hold a conference call this afternoon, to discuss the state of play around Greece. But it has also dampened hopes that this call would take the eurozone closer to an agreement over Greece\u2019s reform plans. Spokesman Martin Jaeger told reporters in Berlin that he only has \u201cmodest\u201d expectations for the call. \u201cIn the best case scenario we expect there could be some kind of preliminary interim review but it\u2019s hard to predict how things will develop next week.\u201d That\u2019s notably gloomier than the Greek side, who remain upbeat despite the lack of progress. Remember, economy minister George Stathakis said this morning that: \u201cThe agreement will close on (Greek Orthodox) Easter week.\u201d Last week, I rather expected that we\u2019d soon see another late-night crunch session in Brussels to debate Greece\u2019s finances. But this (obviously) hasn\u2019t happened yet. And as long as we don\u2019t have an agreement between Greece and her creditors over a reform package, it\u2019s not going to happen. The FT\u2019s Peter Spiegel is hearing that the next meeting of eurozone finance ministers might not take place for another three weeks.... Journalist Loukia Gyftopoulou has more details about those protests, and arrests, in the Greek parliament courtroom this afternoon: Greek police have now swept into the parliament courtyard to break up the protests: It\u2019s all looking rather lively in Greece today. A group of protesters are now demonstrating on the courtyard of the Greek parliament, as part of a solidarity campaign with prisoners conducting a hunger strike. They are calling for members of an anarchist group to be released from custody, and for Greece\u2019s maximum-security prisons to be closed. Earlier this week they invaded Athens University. Greece\u2019s parliamentary speaker, Zoe Konstantopoulou, is apparently taking developments in her stride. German economist Holder Schmieding blames the new Greek government for the downturn in its economic fortunes this year: Over in Athens, pensioners have held an anti-austerity rally to demand pensions and healthcare benefits to be increased. The Kathimerini newspaper explains: The elderly, who have faced several pension reductions since 2010, also demanded immediate subsidy of their pension funds and measures to restore damage caused by the 2012 haircut (PSI). The protest comes as eurozone officials prepare to hold their teleconference call to discuss the progress (or lack of it) towards an agreement on Greece\u2019s economic reforms. Russia faces a lengthy recession, as the sanctions imposed over Ukraine weaken an economy already suffering from lower oil prices. That\u2019s according to the World Bank, which has just slashed its forecasts for the Russian economy. It now predicts that GDP will shrink by 3.8% in 2015, and another 0.3% in 2016. In December, it expected a mere 0.7% contraction this year, and growth of 0.3% next year. Ireland\u2019s economy continues to bounce back from the lows plumbed during the financial crisis, when its banking collapse triggered a eurozone bailout and years of austerity. Data just released show that Ireland\u2019s unemployment rate has fallen to 10%, from 10.1%. The number of people claiming unemployment benefit fell by 4,700 to 350,600, down from 450,000 five years ago. And in a further piece of good news, Ireland\u2019s central bank has hiked its growth forecast for this year and 2016. Most European stock markets have defied expectations and rallied this morning, reversing yesterday\u2019s slide. The news that eurozone factory growth strengthened last month helped to send shares up in Paris, Frankfurt, Milan and Rome. And in London, the FTSE 100 has jumped by 67 points, or 1%, led by financial stocks - as Nick Fletcher reports here. Greece stock market, though, has been hit by the failure (so far) to reach a package of reforms with creditors. The ATG index has shed 1.2% this morning. Howard Archer, economist at IHS Global Insight, is also disappointed that Britain\u2019s labour productivity fell back in the fourth quarter of 2014. He writes: Productivity currently remains limited compared to pre-crisis levels and the latest relapse will fuel concern that much of this has to do with structural factors. How productivity develops going forward will be a critical factor in how soon and how far the Bank of England raises interest rates. If productivity has taken a significant lasting hit, it means that the economy has less potential to grow without generating inflationary pressures and that interest rates will need to rise at an earlier stage. Back to Greece......and eurocrisis expert Yannis Koutsomitis is tweeting some interesting developments around its funding needs: (T-bills are short-term government debt, which Greece has been issuing to keep itself afloat) As we covered early this morning, Greek ministers are predicting a deal next week on economic reforms, that would unlock some aid from its creditors. Without a deal, Greece will struggle to meet an \u20ac450m IMF payment a week tomorrow, and then must pay workers salaries and pensions at the start of May. Vicky Redwood, UK economist at Capital Economics, is concerned that Britain\u2019s productivity fell by another 0.2% in the last quarter: \u201cThis still isn\u2019t great - productivity has still not even returned to its long-run average rate of about 2%, let alone recouped any of the shortfall relative to its pre-crisis trend.\u201d Britain\u2019s persistently weak productivity gives another insight into the true state of the UK economy, as politicians trade blows ahead of May\u2019s election. Today\u2019s ONS report shows that David Cameron has presided over an economy with the weakest productivity record of any government since the second world war, says economics editor Larry Elliott. Yesterday we learned that growth had picked up during the last quarter, but that GDP per head was still lower than before the financial crisis. If the UK economy was truly strengthening, surely labour force productivity would be increasing as firms invested in new equipment and pioneered better ways of working? Despite the recovery, Britain\u2019s economy still suffers from weak productivity. Data just released by the Office for National Statistics shows that labour force productivity fell by 0.2% in the last three months of 2014. In simple terms, that means British employees actually generated slightly less economic activity for each hour they spent at work during the last three months of 2014. The ONS says there was no improvement in productivity last year, and that the economy is still less productive than before the financial crisis. It says: The absence of productivity growth in the seven years since 2007 is unprecedented in the post-war period. March was a good month for UK factories too -- the sector grew at its fastest rate in eight months. The UK manufacturing PMI rose to 54.4 in March, up from 54.0 in February, thanks to strong domestic demand. Export orders picked up too, as the \u201cbright start to the year\u201d continues. Greece is not sharing in this revival in the eurozone economy -- its factory sector contracted again last month. Greece\u2019s manufacturers reported a third straight monthly drop in output in March, confirming that economic conditions have deteriorated since the country\u2019s political upheaval began. Firms reported another drop in new orders, particularly from abroad, suggesting uncertainty over its bailout programme has hit confidence. This pushed the Greek factory PMI, measuring activity across the sector, below the 50-point mark separating expansion from contraction for the seventh month running. Markit explains: Weighing on overall inflows of new business was a sharp and accelerated decrease in new export orders, which panel members linked in part to foreign clients being deterred by political uncertainty in Greece. Economist Phil Smith warned that Greece\u2019s recovery \u201clooks to be on hold for now.\u201d The eurozone\u2019s economic recovery has strengthened, as manufacturing activity across the region grew at the fastest pace since last May. Growth accelerated in Germany, Spain, Italy and the Netherlands, as the European Central Bank\u2019s quantitative easing programme stimulates demand and drives down the euro. Markit\u2019s manufacturing PMI, just released, hit a 10-month high of 52.2 -- higher than that 51.9 estimated two weeks ago. And as already flagged up this morning, many firms reported they took on more staff to handle increased demand. Chris Williamson, Chief Economist at Markit, says the eurozone economy is reviving, but there are black spots. \u201cProducers are benefitting from the weaker euro, which has had the dual effect of boosting competitiveness in export markets as well as making competing imports more expensive in the home markets. \u201cNew orders are consequently showing the best growth for nearly a year, and the fact that manufacturers are boosting their payroll numbers at the fastest rate for three-and-a half years indicates optimism that the upturn will be sustained in coming months. \u201cRising demand is also helping firms and their suppliers to re-establish some pricing power. Factory input prices rose for the first time in seven months and selling prices were broadly stable, providing encouraging news that deflationary forces are easing. \u201cThis is still a fledgling recovery, however, and the overall rate of expansion remains only modest. Importantly, manufacturing is still in decline in France, Greece and Austria, acting as drags on the region\u2019s revival.\u201d Those French and German PMIs are both higher than the \u2018flash\u2019 readings two weeks ago, suggesting that conditions improved during March. Here comes Germany\u2019s manufacturing PMI... ...and it\u2019s another month of solid growth for factories in Europe\u2019s largest economy. The German manufacturing PMI rose to 52.8 in March, up from 51.1, which shows tht faster growth in eleven months. France\u2019s factory sector has shrunk again, but at least the pace of decline has slowed. The French manufacturing PMI came in at 48.8 for March, up from 47.6 in February -- but still below the 50-point mark that splits expansion and contraction. Good news from Italy too -- factory output has hit an 11-month high last month. Data firm Markit reports that the Italian manufacturing PMI jumped to 53.3, from 51.9, showing that the sector expanded. Growth is \u201cgathering momentum\u201d, it says, with firms hiring staff at the fastest rate since February 2011. Here\u2019s the key points: Spain\u2019s economic recovery continues to pick up pace, as the weaker euro gives Spanish firms a boost. The Spanish PMI jumped to 54.3 from 54.2, which is another month of solid growth. Crucially, firms hired staff at the fastest rate since June 2007. And many reported that new business from abroad was boosted by the relative weakness of the euro, particularly against the US dollar. Andrew Harker, senior economist at Markit and author of the report, says the trend of \u201cconsistently solid growth\u201d continued last month: The highlight from the latest survey was the strongest rise in employment since mid-2007, as the labour market continues to recover. Meanwhile, the sharp reductions in input prices seen in the first two months of the year were not repeated at the end of Q1 as the weakness of the euro led to rises in the cost of imported items.\u201d Turkey\u2019s factory sector has contracted at the fastest rate in almost six years. Output, new orders, and new export orders all declined, adding to concerns that its economy is slowing down. Firms reported \u201cgenerally weak domestic and international market conditions\u201d. Yesterday\u2019s mysterious power cut, which left half the country without energy, won\u2019t have helped -- many factories in the western city of Izmit weren\u2019t able to work, for example. Russia\u2019s factory sector continued to contract last month. HSBC\u2019s Russia Manufacturing PMI, measures activity in the sector, fell to 48.1 from 49.7. Any reading below 50 shows a drop in activity. The sanctions imposed on Russia over the Ukraine conflict may be biting, along with the impact of the lower oil price. Many firms reporting that conditions have deteriorated. Paul Smith, Senior Economist at Markit, warned that some companies are struggling to get financing too: \u201cMarch\u2019s survey data indicated that operating conditions remained challenging overall, with output, new orders and employment all posting modest falls. Access to working capital also remains a hurdle to overcome for a number of manufacturers.\u201d Overnight, an official survey of the Chinese factory sector was a little stronger than expected in March, driving the Shanghai stock market to a new seven-year high. The official Chinese manufacturing PMI rose to 50.1 from 49.9, showing very marginal growth. But a rival survey was less optimistic, showing a drop in employment and new orders. More stimulus may still be needed to stop the country\u2019s economy slowing. More here. With a deal before Western Easter looking very unlikely, Greece\u2019s government has now declared that it will reach agreement with its lenders before Orthodox Easter (which falls on 12 April). Economy Minister George Stathakis has just told Skai TV that the two sides will agree a package of reforms next week, saying: \u201cThe agreement will close on (Greek Orthodox) Easter week.\u201d For that to happen, the Greek side will have to produce a credible, detailed programme of reforms. Some officials in Brussels have warned that the current plan is still too much of a \u2018wish list\u2019. And next week looks rather lively; with the IMF expecting a \u20ac450m repayment from Greece on Thursday, April 9th. Stathakis also tried to placate critics in his own party, who oppose selling off state assets. He said the government still plans to hold a stake in the country\u2019s largest port, Piraeus, rather than selling the whole thing. \u201cThe idea that prevailed is that we will not proceed with a privatisation of the 67 percent stake, which would mean a full privatisation of Piraeus port. We are not discussing this.\u201d \u201cWe are trying to find some kind of joint venture.\u201d (quotes via Reuters) Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. With Greece\u2019s negotiations with its creditors over economic reforms seemingly becalmed, eurozone finance officials will hold a teleconference call today to assess the state of play. The euro working group will discuss the chances of a deal, following five days of talks in Brussels which ended yesterday. Although the Athens side are making positive noises, there\u2019s no indication yet that we\u2019re close to a breakthrough that would release the bailout funds it desperately needs. No wonder Angela Merkel and Francois Hollande were chivvying Greece to speed things up, at a press conference on Tuesday. Billionaire investor Warren Buffett waded into the issue last night, telling CNBC that \u201cIf it turns out the Greeks leave, that may not be a bad thing for the euro. \u201cIf everybody learns that the rules mean something and if they come to general agreement about fiscal policy among members, or something of the sort, that they mean business, that could be a good thing.\u201d The European Central Bank is also expected to ponder the Greek crisis today, to decide whether to continue providing emergency liquidity to the Greek banking sector. That support is effectively keeping Greek banks alive, as worried savers continue to withdraw funds The lack of progress in Greece is weighing on Europe\u2019s stock markets; they\u2019re expected to fall again today, adding to yesterday\u2019s tumble. And there\u2019s also lots of economic data due this morning, with Markit releasing its Purchasing Managers Index surveys of Europe\u2019s manufacturing sectors. The PMIs are likely to show that eurozone factories continued to grow, but that France lagged behind again. We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day...",

The response of the fund on the ground will therefore be important. Of course, the fund finds itself in a bit of a circular position. It is unlikely to get paid if it does not approve Greece\u2019s review, but how can it approve the review if it is not getting paid?....</p> <p><strong>Gap with creditors grows, reputation harmed:</strong> Linked to the above, given that not paying the IMF is usually a course of action reserved only for war torn countries or those on the fringes of the international system, not to mention severly underdeveloped economies, Greece could see its reputation severely dented. Furthermore, it is possible that Greece\u2019s creditors will see that Greece has decided to pay wages and pensions first rather than meet its commitments to them. Whether or not this is a fair assessment, this could drive further animosity between the two sides.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/OpenEurope/statuses/583268486195109888\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>So what happens if <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Greece?src=hash\">#Greece</a> fails to pay the IMF on time?

I thought it of interest to relate their salaries and wealth to their views using Google and Wikipedia. I see their champion Stuart Rose\u2019s estimated salary at M&amp;S was \u00a31.3m, while Duncan Bannantyne, another signatory, has a net wealth of \u00a3175m. Ron Dennis is worth \u00a3320m whilst Nigel Rudd has \u00a350m to call upon. I don\u2019t have any sour grapes towards these people, but not for them the food bank, the bedroom tax or the zero hours contract; not for their children the school with classes of over 30. Like the millionaire members of the Tory cabinet they are completely isolated from the daily lives of ordinary families in the UK.</p> <p>No wonder they want the continuation of the present regime; its done them proud. Never mind the rest of us. However, being well known and stinking rich are fairly narrow qualifications and not ideal ones with which to determine government policy. What we need is the adoption by the Labour party of an economic and social plan which is not based on the exploitation of one group in favour of another, but one which values everyone for what they are and what they can achieve. As the rich get richer, the poor get poorer, as the welfare state is gradually demolished so that more of those who already have more than their share can get more. Enough is enough.

      "bodyText": "I note that a group of business people are supporting the Tory\u2019s economic plan (Report, 1 April). I thought it of interest to relate their salaries and wealth to their views using Google and Wikipedia. I see their champion Stuart Rose\u2019s estimated salary at M&amp;S was \u00a31.3m, while Duncan Bannantyne, another signatory, has a net wealth of \u00a3175m. Ron Dennis is worth \u00a3320m whilst Nigel Rudd has \u00a350m to call upon. I don\u2019t have any sour grapes towards these people, but not for them the food bank, the bedroom tax or the zero hours contract; not for their children the school with classes of over 30. Like the millionaire members of the Tory cabinet they are completely isolated from the daily lives of ordinary families in the UK. No wonder they want the continuation of the present regime; its done them proud. Never mind the rest of us. However, being well known and stinking rich are fairly narrow qualifications and not ideal ones with which to determine government policy. What we need is the adoption by the Labour party of an economic and social plan which is not based on the exploitation of one group in favour of another, but one which values everyone for what they are and what they can achieve. As the rich get richer, the poor get poorer, as the welfare state is gradually demolished so that more of those who already have more than their share can get more. Enough is enough. It\u2019s time things changed. Viv Gale Hartland. North Devon \u2022 It\u2019s hardly surprising to learn that most top business leaders would prefer a Conservative government. But what I do find shocking is to see this regarded as unequivocally good news for the Tories, and bad for Labour. Since when did we as a nation unquestioningly believe that what\u2019s good for the corporate elite is good for all of us? Lindsay Camp Bristol \u2022 I trust your reporters will leave no stone unturned investigating how many of the 100 companies whose bosses have written to the Telegraph pay their full corporation tax, are not registered offshore and are paying their employees the living wage, without zero hours contracts. Michael Long Wylam, Northumberland One hundred voters, businessmen who have done well under a conservative led coalition, feel so empowered by their prosperity that they patronise the entire electorate with an orchestrated letter to selected news media recommending more of the same. \u2022 I for one shall not join them but am grateful for the list of business organisations whose leaders have such opinions of themselves that I shall feel justified in avoiding them.

      "body": "<p>Richard Woolnough of M&amp;G is among the biggest earners in an industry famed for its bloated pay packets. Last year he scooped \u00a317.5m following a bumper year for his bond funds.</p> <p>Over the last 12 months, however, his performance has gone off the boil, and his giant funds have slipped into the bottom half of the performance tables. Common sense would suggest his paypacket might shrivel accordingly \u2013 but the Prudential\u2019s accounts, published this week, reveal the 51-year-old was paid \u00a315.5m \u2013 far in excess of the \u00a311.8m paid to his boss, Tidjane Thiam. <br></p> <p>Behind Woolnough\u2019s enormous pay packet lies M&amp;G\u2019s extraordinary global asset gathering machine. The funds he manages are huge; Optimal Income has nearly \u00a325bn in assets, while his Corporate Bond fund has another \u00a35bn. In total, he manages around \u00a335bn. But relatively little of that money has come from UK investors; Woolnough\u2019s success has been to crack open Europe\u2019s fund management market, drawing in billions from small investors from the heel of Italy to the far north of Norway. </p> <p>Last year, Optimal Income was the single biggest\u2013selling fund in Europe. Even as news broke in the UK of his sky-high pay, Woolnough was in Paris presenting to French investors, hoping to garner yet more assets from European investors who now make up around two-thirds of his customers. </p> <p>Yet his performance has, temporarily at least, gone awry.

      "bodyText": "Richard Woolnough of M&amp;G is among the biggest earners in an industry famed for its bloated pay packets. Last year he scooped \u00a317.5m following a bumper year for his bond funds. Over the last 12 months, however, his performance has gone off the boil, and his giant funds have slipped into the bottom half of the performance tables. Common sense would suggest his paypacket might shrivel accordingly \u2013 but the Prudential\u2019s accounts, published this week, reveal the 51-year-old was paid \u00a315.5m \u2013 far in excess of the \u00a311.8m paid to his boss, Tidjane Thiam. Behind Woolnough\u2019s enormous pay packet lies M&amp;G\u2019s extraordinary global asset gathering machine. The funds he manages are huge; Optimal Income has nearly \u00a325bn in assets, while his Corporate Bond fund has another \u00a35bn. In total, he manages around \u00a335bn. But relatively little of that money has come from UK investors; Woolnough\u2019s success has been to crack open Europe\u2019s fund management market, drawing in billions from small investors from the heel of Italy to the far north of Norway. Last year, Optimal Income was the single biggest\u2013selling fund in Europe. Even as news broke in the UK of his sky-high pay, Woolnough was in Paris presenting to French investors, hoping to garner yet more assets from European investors who now make up around two-thirds of his customers. Yet his performance has, temporarily at least, gone awry. According to trustnet.com, M&amp;G Optimal Income made a gain of just 3.7% for investors over the past 12 months, compared to 6.4% for the average bond fund. It currently ranks a lowly 54th out of 74 funds. M&amp;G Corporate Bond gained a healthier 9.3% last year \u2013 but still lagged the sector, which turned in an average gain of 10.4%.

In euro terms, the fund figures look better than in sterling, and in any case European investors prize low volatility as much as investment growth \u2013 and Woolnough has managed remarkably steady returns in turbulent times. M&amp;G bases its bonuses on longer-term performance rather than one-year returns and it is understood that his bonus is in the form of Prudential shares, and deferred for several years.

    "webTitle": "UK productivity growth is weakest since second world war, says ONS", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "David Cameron has presided over an economy with the weakest productivity record of any government since the second world war, the Office for National Statistics said as it revealed output per worker fell again in the final three months of 2014. The ONS said productivity decreased by 0.2% in the third quarter of the financial year, leaving output per hour worked little changed on the previous year and slightly lower than in 2007, before the UK\u2019s longest and deepest modern recession. \u201cThese estimates show that the absence of productivity growth in the seven years since 2007 is unprecedented in the postwar period,\u201d the ONS said. Labour seized on the data showing that two years of solid growth have failed to translate into the customary recovery in wage and productivity growth. Shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna said the economy \u201csimply isn\u2019t working for working people\u201d. The ONS figures show that with workers producing less than they did in 2007, Britain\u2019s productivity gap with its major economic rivals, such as the US, Germany and France, has widened. The UK has the second worst productivity record of the G7 leading Western industrial nations. Weak productivity has been the flipside to strong employment growth, since the increase in the number of people working has not been matched by the hourly output of goods and services they have produced. Up until the global economic crisis, the efficiency of UK workers tended to increase by around 2-2.5% a year. Had that trend continued, productivity would have been 15% higher than it was before the recession. An alternative measure of productivity, output per worker, showed some growth in 2014 as a result of employees working longer hours. \u201cThis still isn\u2019t great \u2013 productivity [growth] has still not even returned to its long-run average rate of about 2%, let alone recouped any of the shortfall relative to its pre-crisis trend,\u201d said Vicky Redwood, UK economist at Capital Economics. The ONS said, despite Britain\u2019s poor productivity, businesses were keeping their costs in check by keeping a lid on their wage bills. Labour is likely to use the latest data to make the case that higher employment is not leading to a pickup in wages and the sort of boost to living standards that would normally follow a recovery in the economy. In a separate blow to the government, a poll of leading economists showed that two-thirds believed George Osborne\u2019s austerity programme had been bad for the economy. The Centre for Macroeconomics polled 50 economists, asking them whether they agreed that the government\u2019s deficit-reduction strategy had had a positive impact on growth and employment. One-third disagreed and a further third strongly disagreed. Only 15% agreed, with none strongly agreeing. There was better news for the government from the latest snapshot of manufacturing from CIPS/Markit. This showed activity standing at 54.4 points in March, up from 54.1 points in February, its highest level since last August. Any reading above 50 indicates manufacturing is expanding rather than contracting. Howard Archer, UK economist at IHS Global Insight, said: \u201cThis is a generally very reassuring survey, which indicates that the manufacturing sector is in decent shape despite latest hard data showing manufacturing output fell back 0.5% in January.\u201d Umunna said: \u201cUnder the Tories, we\u2019ve seen the rise of a low-wage, low-skilled economy and insecure work as productivity has stagnated, with real wages down by an average of \u00a31,600 a year. \u201cLabour\u2019s better plan will boost high-skilled, better-paid jobs. We will raise the minimum wage and incentivise firms to pay a living wage, ensure every school leaver with the grades can access a high-quality apprenticeship and back small firms by cutting \u2013 then freezing \u2013 business rates. TUC general secretary Frances O\u2019Grady said: \u201cThe UK is fast becoming a low-wage, low-productivity economy. We won\u2019t see the improvements needed in pay or productivity if the Conservatives get the chance to deliver their plans for more extreme austerity after the election.\u201d John Philpott, director of the Jobs Economist consultancy, said: \u201cThe UK\u2019s currently very good headline GDP growth and jobs data conceal a worrying underlying picture of a low wage, labour intensive economy that does not bode well for widespread ongoing improvement in the overall standard of living. \u201cAlthough the dire labour productivity figures might not feature too high in political rhetoric and voter concerns during the general election campaign, how to boost productivity is ultimately the most important economic question now facing UK policymakers, business leaders and workers.\u201d",

The company said that by 2018 around a third of its fleet would be leased, a third equity financed, and a further third debt financed. \u201cFastjet will also use the proceeds of the placing to expand its existing operations and expects to further increase the frequency of flights on all its current routes\u201d, the budget airline said. The company also announced plans to consolidate its shares after the placing, and unveiled Clive Carver as its interim chairman.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Conservative party managers take their pre-election letters to the Daily Telegraph from business leaders terribly seriously. The exercise has become a ritual. The rounding-up of supporters starts months in advance and each letter must carry more signatories than the last. On that narrow measure, Wednesday\u2019s letter succeeds. There are 103 names versus 68 in 2010. The letter is also more of a full-throated call to vote Tory, rather than last time\u2019s specific applause for George Osborne\u2019s plan to halt a rise in national insurance. Bankers are still absent from the list, presumably because their support would be deemed an electoral liability. Hedge fund managers and private equity tycoons are also a no-no. But a few notable names from the non-financial business world who signed last time are missing. Where\u2019s Justin King, former Sainsbury\u2019s boss? Lord Wolfson, chief executive of Next, is a Tory peer but is not there. Sir Christopher Gent, chairman of GlaxoSmithKline and another usual suspect, is not on the list. That said, in terms of the overall range of support, the 2015 version is roughly as broad as last time (and, full disclosure: Brent Hoberman, a non-executive director of Guardian Media Group, owner of the Guardian, signed). But do these letters from Tory-supporting business people win many votes? Is Ed Miliband damaged by having such opponents? One suspects the short answer to both questions is: probably not. First, is anyone really surprised that the Conservative party can muster 100 supporters from the world of (mostly) big business? The surprise factor is approximately zero. By contrast, it was a minor revelation in 1997 when Tony Blair recruited some high-profile business names to Labour\u2019s camp; it demonstrated support from non-traditional quarters. Second, Labour can make an easy counter-punch. Miliband has positioned himself as a leader who is prepared to take on vested interests, from utility companies to banks, to the Murdoch press. It may do no electoral harm to be opposed by individuals who would be liable to pay income tax at Labour\u2019s proposed top rate of 50p in the pound. Small businesses, Labour can argue, would much prefer a cut in business rates to Osborne\u2019s next reduction in corporation tax; Lord Rose, former boss of Marks &amp; Spencer and now chairman of Ocado, struggled to give a convincing answer on the radio on Wednesday morning. Third, while the letter argues that \u201cthis Conservative-led government has been good for business,\u201d nowhere does it address the obvious economic shortcomings of the past five years. Productivity has fallen in the UK: output per hour worked is lower even than in 2007. Real living standards, at best, have flatlined in this parliament. And, mostly notably in this context, business investment has stalled. If coalition-run Britain was such a fertile place for investment, why didn\u2019t the corporate pounds flow and why is the UK\u2019s current account deficit at a record 5.5%? Answers in the next letter to the Telegraph. Or not. Troubled waters at BG \u201cThe committee recognises that 2014 has been a particularly important year for the company on remuneration matters, and is grateful for the high level of engagement from shareholders,\u201d says Sir John Hood, chair of BG Group\u2019s pay committee, in this year\u2019s annual report. He makes the process sound almost smooth. Lest we forget, \u201cengagement\u201d involved several institutional shareholders, including Legal &amp; General, speaking out publicly against the original \u00a325m pay package offered to incoming chief executive Helge Lund. They thought the \u201cgolden hello\u201d portion was too large and were appalled that BG was prepared to break a supposedly binding three-year pay policy that shareholders had approved only six months earlier. Many agreed with Simon Walker, head of the Institute of Directors, that Lund was a top-notch hire but his package was \u201cexcessive, inflammatory and a red rag to the enemies of the free market.\u201d In the end, the company spared itself a high-risk vote on Lund\u2019s award only because the man from Statoil agreed to accept less and to concede stiffer performance conditions. Hood says he and his colleagues \u201cwill redouble our efforts\u201d to engage with shareholders this year. Jolly good, but precise calibration of your toil is not required. It\u2019s very simple: if your shareholders have approved a pay policy, stick to it. Quindell cock-up It was too much to ask that Quindell, source of so much entertainment in the past year, could sell 90% of itself without one final cock-up. So here it is, a mere two days after the \u00a3637m sale of the professional services division to Australian outfit Slater &amp; Gordon was announced: the profit numbers for the departing business were wrong in the shareholder circular. Fortunately, it matters little that the figure for the first half of 2014 should have been \u00a3130m, not \u00a3113m, and that somebody forgot to include the contributions of two software units the Australians are also taking. The departure of those small units will leave rump Quindell looking even smaller. In practice, most shareholders couldn\u2019t care less. All they want is the \u00a3500m special dividend that will follow the disposal, and that\u2019s not affected one jot. No harm done, then, but we\u2019ll miss these farces when, or if, they end.",

Mathewson was the chief executive and then the chairman of RBS until 2006 and is the chairman of Shawbrook, which was created in 2011 and provides loans to small and medium-sized UK businesses and consumers. His role is likely to be brief, however, as he said earlier this month that he would step down from the board once a successor had been found. Shawbrook, which is backed by funds advised by Pollen Street Capital, priced its initial public offering at 290p per share and said it expected to raise \u00a390m from the flotation. It sold 75m shares, or about 30% of its equity. Its chief executive, Richard Pyman, said Shawbrook would be able to grow and become a better-known name in specialist business banking. He said: \u201cOur focus remains on providing UK customers with a fresh, pragmatic approach to lending and savings while driving further growth by maximising opportunities in existing markets, capitalising on the embedded growth in our current loan book and developing a range of products to facilitate expansion into adjacent segments.\u201d Customer loans increased by 70% in 2014 to \u00a32.3bn. Shawbrook\u2019s flotation comes amid a flurry of stock market activity in the financial sector. The challenger bank Aldermore floated earlier this month, valued at around \u00a3650m.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Scotch whisky exports fell last year for the first time in a decade, declining by 7% to \u00a33.9bn, adding to the industry\u2019s difficulties with domestic sales during 2014. The Scotch Whisky Association (SWA) blamed weaker economic conditions in some markets and political volatility in others for the decline, with the volume of whisky sales overseas also falling by 3% to 1.2bn standard bottles. The difficult year ends a decade of continuing sales increases and record-breaking growth. The total value of all whisky exports has increased by 74% since 2004, and premium single malt sales grew particularly strongly by 159% over the decade. That growth in single malt sales is based on marketing whisky to newly enriched middle-class consumers in emerging markets, but political volatility in Russia and Ukraine hit sales hard. Russia dropped out of the SWA\u2019s top 20 markets, with the value of direct sales there down 95% from \u00a325m to \u00a32m in a single year. The global slump also mirrors a 5% fall in UK volume sales last year, down to 83m bottles and the steepest annual fall for several years. That prompted the SWA to increase its campaign for a reduction in UK whisky duty, which was rewarded by the chancellor, George Osborne, with a 2% cut. The SWA said the largest dip in overseas sales last year came in the US, the industry\u2019s largest market, where sales fell 9% to \u00a3748m. The SWA believes Osborne\u2019s duty cut will influence other governments to slash import tariffs and help boost sales. It is backing free trade agreements, including an EU deal with Vietnam, and further agreements with Canada, Colombia and Peru. David Frost, the association\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cEconomic and political factors in some important markets held back exports in 2014 after a decade of strong growth. It shows that the industry\u2019s success cannot be taken for granted and that we must continue to argue for more open markets and ambitious trade deals that tackle barriers to market access.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Price cuts and investment in its international business drove down profits at online fashion retailer Asos in the first six months of the year. A record Christmas trading period, when sales increased by 14%, was not enough to lift profits for the first half overall. Pre-tax profit fell to \u00a318m in the six months to end-February, from \u00a320m over the same period a year earlier. Revenue rose 14% to \u00a3550m. It follows a torrid time for the retailer, whose ranges are targeted at \u201cfashion-conscious twentysomethings\u201d. Last year, Asos suffered a fire at its main warehouse in Barnsley, South Yorkshire and issued a series of profit warnings, while adverse currency movements hit international sales. Asos sells its own brands as well as third-party brands and high street names such as Mango, French Connection and River Island. Among its bestsellers in the first half were playsuits and jumpsuits, shirts, trainers, oversized coats and scarves. \u201cWe increased our gifting range with a more extensive selection of beauty, men\u2019s grooming, novelty gifts and also more traditional items such as nightwear,\u201d the company said. \u201cIn addition, events such as Halloween and Valentine\u2019s Day are becoming increasingly important to our customers and we have responded by adding specific ranges for these celebrations.\u201d UK sales jumped 27% over the first half, while international sales increased by 5%. Nick Robertson, the chief executive who co-founded Asos in 2000, sold about \u00a320m of shares in the company in January, amounting to about 10% of his holding. It left him with an 8% stake, making him the company\u2019s second-largest shareholder. \u201cWith our continued investment in our international price competitiveness gaining traction, momentum in the business is building. This gives us confidence in the outlook for the second half and that full-year profit and margin will be in line with expectations,\u201d Robertson said. The shares jumped nearly 7% in early trading before ending the day 2.7% higher at \u00a337.28.",

      "bodyText": "The peer-to-peer currency exchange website CurrencyFair is aiming to take on Australia\u2019s big four banks and double its small Newcastle workforce with a multimillion-dollar injection of funding. The company has enabled expats and holidaymakers to transfer $2.5bn at a fraction of the cost charged by the banks since its founding five years ago. And now it is believed to be about to complete a fundraising worth about \u20ac10m ($14m), that its co-founder, Australian Brett Meyers, says hopes will enable it to improve its website, increase marketing and double staff at its Australian base. Transactions in Australian dollars is the fastest-growing part of the business and CurrencyFair is gunning to take more customers from Australia\u2019s powerful banks. \u201cPeople don\u2019t realise what rates they are paying to the banks,\u201d Meyers said on a recent visit to Australia. \u201cThey say, well, the banks are giving me free banking. But the margins are built in. \u201cThe European and UK banks charge 3%, but Australian banks are even worse at around 5.5%.\u201d Meyers, who claims to have saved his customers an estimated $135m since starting the business, thinks the reason Australian banks are able to charge more is because trust in the financial sector is still high, unlike in Europe. \u201cAustralia never had a banking crisis,\u201d he says. \u201cThe sector is not just tech driven, it\u2019s consumer driven. In Europe the crisis lowered trust in banks and allowed them to consider an alternative because they were so fed up with the status quo. But you\u2019ve not had that here.\u201d Building the business in Australia makes sense. The company takes a commission of about 0.3% from transactions in which customers in effect swap currency with each other. It has processed about $2.5bn in five years \u2013 with more than half of that coming last year. A fifth of its business is in Australian dollars. \u201cAustralian dollar is growing the fastest. We\u2019ve done more marketing in the UK and a bit in Ireland but we\u2019d like to really push this region,\u201d he said. Meyers recently visited his home city of Perth where he was testing marketing initiatives such as free flight offers to capitalise on CurrencyFair\u2019s popularity with the Irish community in Australia. Growing the business will be good news for the tech sector in Newcastle where CurrencyFair has a team of seven but which Meyers thinks could double in size. Its headquarters in Dublin employs 46 people and could grow by a similar margin. New staff would be put to work making it easier for customers to use the service but also for developing new ideas. These include allowing a customer to use their CurrencyFair account to buy goods and services. For example, a customer could pay for a hotel room in, say, Hong Kong, from a CurrencyFair account in HK dollars without having to pay credit card charges. The business receiving the money would also avoid charges, making the arrangement mutually beneficial. As Meyers points out, the trick is anticipating what consumers want: \u201cAs Henry Ford said, if he\u2019d asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Every taxation review really boils down to two questions: how much should we tax? and how should we raise that tax? The tax paper released by Joe Hockey on Monday is clearly focused on increasing tax through sales rather than from income. It will be a tough sell and Hockey has suggested the paper is the start of a conversation. If Hockey is to produce any changes to the current system, he will need to be prepared to talk and listen for a very long time. As John Quiggin pointed out yesterday, there aren\u2019t many new ideas in the discussion paper. In 2010 we had the Henry tax review, and pretty much a lot of what is covered in the discussion paper was given a once over back then. The current review is more focused on the GST than in the Henry Review (the Labor government was too scared to even examine the issue), but it also has a few blind spots. For example, the Henry tax review contained a whole section on \u201ctaxes to improve the environment\u201d, whereas this current review ignores it and boasts instead that \u201clast year the government abolished the carbon and mining taxes, which were a drag on growth\u201d. Removing the carbon tax also lost around $9bn in tax revenue over the next three years, but oddly that doesn\u2019t get a mention. Overall the paper is framed as trying to \u201cdeliver taxes that are lower, simpler, fairer\u201d. But that\u2019s just what they tell the tourists. The paper really is about raising more tax. It hints at this when it compares our tax system to other nations and makes the point that \u201cAustralia has a relatively low tax burden compared to other developed countries.\u201d It\u2019s hard to start from there and then suggest there needs to be less tax raised. How the tax is raised is very much directed towards individuals rather than companies, suggesting that more should be paid through their spending rather than through their income. The paper makes a great deal of the fact Australia relies less on consumption taxes (like the GST) than other nations in the OECD: It also notes that our GST rate is much lower than most others: As a result, we are more reliant upon income taxes from individuals or companies. This is viewed as a negative because broad-based consumption taxes are generally more stable than income taxes \u2013 especially during recessions. For example, from 2007-08 to 2009-10 Australian individual income tax revenue fell 3.1% and company tax revenue fell 15.4% \u2013 but GST revenue rose 3.6%. It\u2019s worth noting however that being reliant on consumption taxes is no cure-all. Of the 33 OECD nations with broad-based consumption taxes, 21 have lifted them since the start of the GFC. But a look at Australia\u2019s tax mix since 1978 shows we have certainly become more reliant upon company tax revenue: In 1978-79 company tax revenue accounted for just 13.2% of all federal government tax revenue. By 1999-2000 \u2013 just before the mining boom took off \u2013 it had only risen to 16.2%. But in 2007-08, at the peak of the boom, it was up to 22%. Even now, despite the end of the investment phase of the mining boom, it still accounts for around 20% of all tax. The paper notes that in the OECD only Norway is more reliant upon company tax than Australia. The concern from the government about company tax is that not only is it subject to some wild swings, it might also be in danger of being lost through tax evasion \u2013 because our 30% company tax rate is among the highest in the OECD: In contrast with the global increases in spending taxes, 21 nations in the OECD have lowered their company tax rate since the GFC. The paper noted that 58% of our company tax revenue is paid by just 960 companies (out of around 800,000). This means that the revenue is very much at risk from companies that might indulge in \u201ctax planning\u201d \u2013 which is the paper\u2019s very diplomatic way of saying \u201ctax avoidance\u201d. It\u2019s an irregular verb: you \u201ctax plan\u201d; I \u201ctax minimise\u201d; he is going to jail for \u201ctax evasion\u201d. And if you think that means it\u2019s a race to the bottom, then you\u2019re right. The response from the government about concerns that companies might avoid tax by notionally setting up shop in a low tax country \u2013 such as Ireland with its 12.5% rate \u2013 is to suggest we lower our tax rate. The paper argues that a lower company tax will \u201creduce the incentive for tax planning and profit shifting from Australia.\u201d This suggestion is a pretty weak response to concerns about international tax shifting and avoidance that Joe Hockey was so gung-ho about reducing at the G20 last year. It\u2019s pretty dispiriting, and it requires a lot of faith that these lower taxes will lead to greater investment, which will in turn lead to more jobs, higher incomes and better standard of living. Of course it won\u2019t raise the revenue base. However devoted you are to supply-side economics, the reality is that when you cut the company tax rate, company tax revenue falls. The paper notes studies in the UK that suggest increased investment from a lower company tax rate could reduce the revenue loss by between \u201c45 and 60 per cent\u201d \u2013 but that still leaves less total revenue. And the paper emphasises that it doesn\u2019t want to raise that extra revenue from individual income tax. It notes that bracket creep \u2013 wherein increases in your income through wage rises takes you into a higher tax bracket \u2013 \u201ccan reduce participation incentives for some groups\u201d. It worth though having a bit of calm about bracket creep. Yes, if you go from earning $75,000 to $82,000 you do go from a marginal tax rate of 32.5% to 37%, but remember it is only for the additional amount earned over $80,000. Also, while there has been some bracket creep due to the lack of any tax cut since 2008-09 \u2013 when the second tier tax threshold was raised from $75,000 to $80,000 \u2013 the current level of second tier income tax is 1.37 times the average income of $58,700 that is still only just below the 30 years average of 1.42: The top tax threshold of $180,000 remains more than three times the average annual earnings of around $58,700 \u2013 well above the 30 year average of the top tax bracket being just 2.26 times average earnings. In 2002-03 the top tax bracket was just $60,000 \u2013 or around 1.63 times average income. Were that ratio in place now, the top tax rate of 47% (including the debt levy) would kick in at a much lower income around $95,600. And it is worth noting that because the marginal tax rates have been cut and the tax-free thresholds have been raised, we all pay much less tax than we used to. In 1984-85, for example, someone on the average wage paid around 20.5% of their income in tax whereas now they pay just 17.8%. And thirty years ago, someone on twice the average earnings would have been paying 32.6% of their income in tax; now they pay only around 26.7%. While we are more dependent upon income taxes for government revenue than other nations, our actual income tax rate is not very high. The income tax wedge which measures both tax paid and also the benefits received as a percentage of income earned places Australia well down the list of other OECD nations: So where will the revenue come from? While the paper does talk of broadening the GST, the more likely option is to just raise it. Most consumption taxes around the world have exemptions for things like food and education \u2013 the UK for example has many such exemptions. But this, of course, is regressive and disproportionally impacts poorer households. So would require some income tax cuts to offset it \u2013 not something you want to do when you\u2019re actually trying to increase the amount of tax you are raising. The paper also notes the massive growth in property losses and the use by high income earners of negative gearing \u2013 and importantly the 50% discount on capital gains tax \u2013 to reduce taxation. But alas, Joe Hockey seems destined to not change it. I have previously debunked Hockey\u2019s bizarre view on the benefits of negative gearing. Fortunately, the massive tax concessions to superannuation (that I have discussed previously) also feature highly in the discussion paper. Given the treasury estimates the revenue forgone is around $27bn a year, it\u2019s little wonder they are under the gun. And even more fortunately, there does appear to be room for bipartisan agreement on this. Another suggestion in the paper is to pay for cuts to company tax by removing dividend imputation. Dividend imputation gives tax free dividends to Australian shareholders. It\u2019s a big bonus for investors. Given \u201cmum and dad\u201d investors and self funded retirees are among those who enjoy that benefits, a policy to remove it would be politically courageous. But that is the case with all tax changes. Yes this tax paper may not have much new, and does repeat the Henry tax review in many ways, but it is still a debate worth having. If we do want the government to provide a certain level of services \u2013 whether for health, education, or social security \u2013 then we do need to look at how it should be funded.

      "body": "<p>Every taxation review really boils down to two questions: how much should we tax? and how should we raise that tax?<br></p> <p>The tax paper released by Joe Hockey on Monday is clearly focused on increasing tax through sales rather than from income. It will be a tough sell and Hockey has suggested the paper is the start of a conversation. If Hockey is to produce any changes to the current system, he will need to be prepared to talk and listen for a very long time. </p> <p>As <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/mar/31/the-worthwhile-ideas-in-hockeys-rethink-on-tax-are-straight-out-of-1975\">John Quiggin</a> pointed out yesterday, there aren\u2019t many new ideas in the discussion paper. In 2010 we had the Henry tax review, and pretty much a lot of what is covered in the discussion paper was given a once over back then. The current review is more focused on the GST than in the Henry Review (the Labor government was too scared to even examine the issue), but it also has a few blind spots. </p> <p>For example, the Henry tax review contained a whole section on \u201ctaxes to improve the environment\u201d, whereas this current review ignores it and boasts instead that \u201clast year the government abolished the carbon and mining taxes, which were a drag on growth\u201d. </p> <p>Removing the carbon tax also lost around $9bn in tax revenue over the next three years, but oddly that doesn\u2019t get a mention. </p> <p>Overall the paper is framed as trying to \u201cdeliver taxes that are lower, simpler, fairer\u201d. But that\u2019s just what they tell the tourists. The paper really is about raising more tax. It hints at this when it compares our tax system to other nations and makes the point that \u201cAustralia has a relatively low tax burden compared to other developed countries.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/mar/31/the-worthwhile-ideas-in-hockeys-rethink-on-tax-are-straight-out-of-1975\">The 'worthwhile ideas' in Hockey's Re:think on tax are straight out of 1975 | John Quiggin</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s hard to start from there and then suggest there needs to be less tax raised. </p> <p>How the tax is raised is very much directed towards individuals rather than companies, suggesting that more should be paid through their spending rather than through their income. </p> <p>The paper makes a great deal of the fact Australia relies less on consumption taxes (like the GST) than other nations in the OECD:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"graph 1\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/l8P1K/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>It also notes that our GST rate is much lower than most others:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"graph 2\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/h78DY/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>As a result, we are more reliant upon income taxes from individuals or companies. </p> <p>This is viewed as a negative because broad-based consumption taxes are generally more stable than income taxes \u2013 especially during recessions.
