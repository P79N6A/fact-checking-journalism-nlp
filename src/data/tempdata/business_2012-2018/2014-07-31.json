It said that a tendency among funds to invest according to economic cycles \u2013 buying riskier assets such as equities in good times and offloading them in times of crisis \u2013 was helping to exacerbate financial crises. A working group led by Andy Haldane, the Bank's chief economist, cited the dotcom crash of the early 2000s and the recent financial crisis as examples of this type of behaviour. The proportion of UK shares owned by pension funds and life insurance companies has fallen sharply from over 50% in the early 1990s to just above 10% in 2012. The group of academics and industry experts, including the former Goldman Sachs chief economist Jim O'Neill, noted in a paper that pension funds and insurers were crucial to the financial system, managing almost \u00a33tn of assets in the UK and \u00a330tn globally. They said there was considerable evidence that these investors tend to adopt a \"herd\" mentality, all changing investment or asset allocation strategies at the same time for fear of being outperformed by peers. If pension funds and insurers were more prepared to invest against the economic cycle, buying riskier assets when they are cheap in a downturn, they could benefit their policyholders and the wider economy, the Bank's paper concluded. \"In principle, by being better placed to look through short-term market volatility than many other types of investor, they also have the potential to be a stabilising influence on the financial system.

    "webTitle": "British Gas predicts fall in energy bills", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain's largest domestic energy supplier, Centrica, has clashed with Ofgem over the regulator's claim that the industry was likely to double its profits over the next 12 months. The owner of British Gas said its household supply arm had recorded a 26% slump in profits in the first half of 2014 and there was no chance of a turnaround over the next year. \"We have 25 independent analysts following the company, and if you look at their forecasts for 2015, there isn't a single one who is forecasting that profit margins will double or anything like that,\" said Centrica's financial director, Nick Luff. Household bills at British Gas are predicted to be about \u00a390 lower this year than in 2013, thanks to mild weather and a freeze on energy prices, said the company. It has lost 600,000 customers over the last year but still reported first half retail profits of \u00a3265m and Centrica group operating profits of just over \u00a31bn. Ofgem said this week that its latest monthly estimates showed overall industry profits are likely to rise to \u00a3106 per household over the next year, up from \u00a353 over the previous 12 months. British gas serves 11m homes. Luff, who will leave later this year as will Centrica chief executive Sam Laidlaw, said Ofgem had been wrong in the past and noted that Centrica's forecast was based on actual consumption whereas the Ofgem used a \"theoretical model\". Jonathan Reynolds, Labour's shadow energy and climate change minister, disagreed. He said Ofgem's forecasts for the industry for the next 12 months was the latest example of an energy market that was not working. \"Britain's hard-pressed bill payers have seen their energy bills rocket, despite falling wholesale costs. That is why Labour would freeze energy bills until 2017 so prices cannot rise, and create a tough new watchdog with the power to force energy companies to cut their prices when wholesale costs fall.\" Richard Lloyd, executive director of consumer group Which?, said: \"British Gas profits are down because of a warm winter, not lower prices. Energy companies must do everything they can to pass on any savings to their customers including falling wholesale and network costs.\" The energy sector is the subject of a wide-ranging investigation into profiteering by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA). Luff said Centrica has held meetings with the CMA and had its own small team working full-time on the inquiry but insisted the company was \"not fearful\" of the outcome of the investigation, which could lead to Britain's big six suppliers being broken up. SSE, ScottishPower, Centrica, RWE npower, E.ON and EDF Energy control about 96% of the market. Luff noted that Centrica had put three gas-fired power stations up for sale two months ago and scrapped plans for an offshore windfarm, the Celtic Array off Anglesey. He said he would be leaving without regrets that Centrica should have done things differently despite mounting criticism from fuel poverty campaigners in recent years. \"We coped with quite dramatic changes in the shape of the energy market,\" he said. Centrica's chairman, Rick Haythornthwaite, paid tribute to the \"exceptional leadership\" of Laidlaw, who will be replaced by BP executive Iain Conn. Figures from French-owned EDF \u2013 another of the big six suppliers, serving 4m households \u2013 showed that operating profits in Britain rose 9.5% to \u00a3560m for the first half of the year. It said the growth was the result of higher output from its nuclear power stations, compared with a period last year when more of its generating capacity was out of service for planned maintenance. EDF said a decline in gas sales due to milder weather was partly offset by 3.2% growth in customer accounts.",

      "bodyText": "Eurozone inflation fell to its lowest level in almost five years in July, bringing the threat of a dangerous deflationary spiral closer. The annual rate of inflation fell unexpectedly to 0.4% from 0.5% in June, dragged lower by accelerating falls in food, alcohol and tobacco prices. Energy prices also fell sharply, by 1%, compared with a 0.1% rise in June. It was the lowest level of annual inflation since October 2009, when prices were in negative territory. Economists had expected the annual rate to remain unchanged at 0.5%. Peter Vanden Houte, chief eurozone economist at ING, said the threat of eurozone deflation was likely to persist. \"[July's] figures don't give any assurance that the eurozone is already out of the deflation danger zone,\" he said. \"Moreover, with the escalating conflict with Russia dampening growth prospects, it seems unlikely that deflation fears will disappear any time soon.\" The fear is that weak price pressures could ultimately trigger a dangerous deflationary spiral, where consumers and businesses damage their domestic economies by putting off spending amid expectations that prices will fall further still. Policymakers at the European Central Bank (ECB) took action in June to stave off the threat of deflation and breathe some life into the currency bloc's flagging economy. The main interest rate was cut to a record low of 0.15% and a \u20ac400bn (\u00a3317bn) package of cheap funding for banks was announced, with the condition that the money be used to lend to companies outside the financial sector, and not for mortgages. The ECB also announced it would in effect charge banks to deposit money, by imposing a negative rate of interest of -0.1% on deposits. The hope is that it will encourage banks to lend more to consumers and businesses, boosting the wider economy. However, the central bank stopped short of introducing quantitative easing, where the bank would pump money into the markets by acquiring sovereign bonds directly from financial institutions. Vanden Houte said the ECB was unlikely to announce further measures to stimulate the economy in the short term, despite July's drop in inflation. This was partly because of a recent fall in the value of the euro, which makes imports more expensive and could therefore push prices higher. \"The good news for the ECB is that the recent weakening of the euro exchange rate takes away some of the pressure to come up with additional monetary easing measures in the near future,\" he said. \"At the same time, the bank has already given the message that it wants to evaluate first the impact of earlier announced measures, before contemplating additional action. This all but excludes new measures, like outright QE, for the remainder of this year.\" In a better sign for the eurozone economy, the region's unemployment rate edged lower to 11.5% in June from 11.6% in May. It was the lowest rate since September 2012, according to Eurostat, the EU's statistics office. The lowest rate was Austria's 5%, followed by Germany's 5.1%. At the other end of the scale, unemployment stands at 27.3% in Greece and 24.5% in Spain. The number of people out of work in the 18-member bloc fell by 152,000 over the month, to 18.4 million. Christian Schulz, senior economist at Berenberg, said there was still a long way to go on getting the labour market back on track. \"Make no mistake, the rate of improvement remains modest. At this pace, it would take six years to reduce unemployment from the current 18.4m to pre-crisis boom levels just above 12m.\"",

Here\u2019s a flavour:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Judge Griesa has for over a decade presided over various lawsuits against Argentina by aggrieved creditors following its 2001 default. Most bondholders grudgingly accepted tough restructuring terms in 2005 and 2010, but a handful of hedge funds \u2013 led by Paul Singer\u2019s Elliott Management \u2013 have continued to pursue the Argentina through the global legal system.</p> <p>Doing so has been difficult. Countries are both uniquely vulnerable and impregnable to irate creditors.

      "bodyText": "Time to recap. Argentina\u2019s government has hit back after failing to agree a deal to avoid defaulting on a loan. Cabinet chief Jorge Capitanich blamed the \u201cincompetence\u201d of the US mediator handling its case, and claimed that Argentina had not actually defaulted. He declared: The credit rating agencies, the financial agents and opinionators who are trying to say that Argentina is in a supposed technical default are playing an absurd hoax that is aimed at destroying the restructuring process of Argentina debt.\u201d Capitanich urged Argentina\u2019s restructured creditors to demand their debt payment which has been frozen by a US court which rules that \u2018holdout\u2019 creditors who must be repaid too. Argentina\u2019s stock market has tumbled, down over 6%, on a day in which all major markets have fallen. Fears over eurozone deflation and the impact of Russian sanctions also spooked investors, on both sides of the Atlantic. Tomorrow, the ISDA trade body will rule on whether Argentina\u2019s failure to make its debt payment before last night\u2019s deadline is a \u2018credit event\u2019. That could trigged credit default swaps - insurance on the bonds. Judge Thomas Griesa, who has been hearing the case, has called a meeting for 11am EST in New York tomorrow to discuss Argentina\u2019s \u201crecent default\u201d. There\u2019s also been speculation that investment banks could throw Argentina a lifeline by buying bonds from the \u2018holdout\u2019 creditors who have been demanding full payment. JPMorgan has declined to comment on these reports (which have been circulating for some time). What the experts say.... The full consequences of Argentina\u2019s default are not yet clear, but several analysts have warned that its economy will be hit hard. Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz SE, said the lawyers are the big winners: Argentina will have a much harder time borrowing money on international markets, and will pay more to do so. Foreigners will be discouraged from making direct investments and Argentines will be encouraged to take money out, further limiting the country\u2019s growth potential. Irene Mia of the Economist Intelligence Unit fears that Argentina\u2019s currency could some under pressure. The default could trigger market nervousness amid the government\u2019s limited firepower to defend the peso (international reserves totalled only US$29.7bn in mid July) and an economy already in recession. A 10% or more peso depreciation is therefore a possibility, with knock out effect on inflation, real wages, interest rates and bank credit. If this happen, we will revise our growth forecast for 2014 and 2015 downward significantly\u201d Mark Stefanini, litigator at international law firm Mayer Brown, predicts that the holdout creditors led by Paul Singer could make more vigorous efforts to track down Argentina\u2019s assets and seize them. And the case has also reignited calls for a new mechanism for sovereign bankruptcies. Eric LeCompte of Jubilee USA Network, argued: Argentina never would have defaulted and hold-outs would have been forced to sit at the table if we had an international bankruptcy process in place. In the coming months we\u2019ll continue to see the G20 to the IMF try to stop this extreme predatory behaviour. Our news story on the Argentinian situation will be launched shortly, so keep watching the website. Good night. GW Another sign of market nerves - the VIX index, which tracks volatility in the markets, has hit a three month high. Argentina\u2019s stock market remains deep in the red after its early plunge, down 6.2%. Brazil\u2019s market has also been hit, down 2.2% so far today. And the Dow Jones index has lost 238 points, or 1.4%, to 16,640. A newsflash from New York, regarding the meeting called for 11am EST, or 4pm BST, tomorrow by Judge Griesa: US JUDGE IN ARGENTINA DEBT DISPUTE SAYS HEARING SET FOR FRIDAY MORNING IS IN REGARD TO \u201cTHE RECENT DEFAULT BY THE REPUBLIC OF ARGENTINA\u201d-COURT FILING That suggests the court wasn\u2019t persuaded by Argentina\u2019s argument that it hasn\u2019t defaulted (having been blocked from making yesterday\u2019s payment) European stock markets have posted hefty losses tonight, as the global markets suffer a bad day. Shares have been dragged down by the Argentinian default, but it\u2019s not the only factor. Traders are also citing this morning\u2019s disappointing eurozone inflation figures, and new fears over the Russian crisis following a profit warning from Adidas. The Esp\u00edrito Santo crisis also weighed on the markets - shares in Banco Esp\u00edrito Santo tumbled by 50% after it posted a shock loss last night. This helped to wipe 3% off the Portuguese stock market. Spain fell 2.1%, closely followed by Germany. The French and Italian markets both lost 1.5%. The FTSE 100 escaped with less damage, down 0.6%. Analysts at ETX Capital explained: European markets fell on Thursday following poor Euro zone economic data, dissent at the Federal Reserve and ongoing weariness about sanctions on Russia. All major European benchmarks declined while US stocks also registered losses a day after the Fed meeting in which policymakers continued to trim the bond buying programme. Elsewhere, the focus remains on possible developments regarding tougher new sanctions on Russia by western powers. The US might move to limit derivatives trading and short-term loans with Russian companies if sanctions already imposed fail to persuade Vladimir Putin to end support for rebels in eastern Ukraine, according to Bloomberg. Already, there have been a number of harsh sanctions that threaten to cripple the Russian economy, so markets are waiting for a response from Putin. All eyes are now on Friday\u2019s widely watched nonfarm payrolls data from the US. Mohamed El-Erian, one of the world\u2019s best-known investors, has warned that almost everyone involved in the Argentina default is a loser -- except the lawyers, of course. El-Erian, the chief economic adviser at Allianz SE (and formally of bond-trading giant Pimco) writes: Argentina, as a nation, is the biggest loser. It will have a much harder time borrowing money on international markets, and will pay more to do so. Foreigners will be discouraged from making direct investments and Argentines will be encouraged to take money out, further limiting the country\u2019s growth potential. The country\u2019s worsening economic and financial conditions are bad news for the government of President Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner. With their credibility already weakened by perceptions of incompetence and corruption, the authorities will find it even harder to govern a country that is operating well below its potential, undermining the well-being of both current and future generations of Argentines. But the \u2018vulture\u2019 hedge funds are winners, right? Not so much, El-Erian reckons: Yes, they took Argentina to the brink and demonstrated their legal power and strategic smarts. But their approach of forcing a generalized sovereign default could well reduce the net present value of their claims on Argentina. In the meantime, they will incur significant legal expenses on top of an already large bill. More here: Argentine Default Creates Many Losers There is a rumour circulating that JP Morgan may be considering stepping in and buying the \u2018holdout\u2019 bonds from Paul Singer\u2019s NML Capital. If so, that could potentially resolve the impasse following last night\u2019s technical default. JP Morgan, though, has declined to comment on the suggestion. Deals of this nature have been rumoured for a while, so best to treat with caution. This story seems to have first emerged in the Argentinian media earlier today. In theory, banks could buy the debt and then do nothing until next year, when Argentina\u2019s pledge to its restructured creditors that it won\u2019t repay the holdouts in full will expire (see earlier post). Business Insider has a good take, here. A reminder that the Argentina stock market has performed very well this year: The International Swaps and Derivatives Association has apparently agreed to consider whether or not Argentina has defaulted. The ISDA panel will meet at 11am Eastern time (4pm BST) on Friday - which is also when Judge Griesa will start holding his hearing on the case. As explained earlier, ISDA will determine whether or not credit default swaps are triggered. The vulture funds who brought the case against Argentina are said to own large quantities of CDSs.... The Argentina stock market has now slid by 6.8%, wiping out almost all of yesterday\u2019s rally, as investors react to last night\u2019s developments. Here\u2019s the biggest fallers on the Merval index. A fresh hearing to discuss the Argentina situation has been called by Judge Thomas Griesa, the man overseeing the case (not terribly well, some say). Shares are falling sharply on the Argentinian stock market. Edenor, Argentina\u2019s largest energy provider, tumbled 12.5%. Telecom Argentina is down 9.5%, and energy giant Petrobras has fallen 7.6%. This has driven the Merval index of major blue-chip companies down by 4% in a rush of selling when trading began. Yesterday it had surged almost 7% on hopes that a last-minute deal could be agreed that would have allowed Argentina to make its bond payment. The Merval been one of the best performing indices this year, up around 60% since the start of January. Bloomberg TV\u2019s Willem Marx has been taking the temperature in Buenos Aires. He reports that citizens sound thoroughly tired of the whole situation, while business owners are very worried that they will suffer a \u201cdisastrous\u201d drop in investment. And everyone\u2019s having to think about the impact on the exchange rate and inflation. Ouch. The Chicago PMI report, which measures business activity in the region, has just been released, and it\u2019s much weaker than expected. Not a great signal for the US economy.... Good question... The Dow Jones industrial average has fallen by 121 points in early trading on Wall Street, down 0.7% to 16759. The International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA), a financial trade body, has been asked to rule on whether Argentina has defaulted. Its decision (which could take a few days) will determine whether or not credit default swaps on Argentina\u2019s debt are triggered. Here\u2019s an explanation of how ISDA\u2019s panel works. The cost of insuring Argentina\u2019s debt against default has soared today. The cost of five-year credit default swap jumped to 1957 basis points, from around 1464 last night. In practice, that means it would cost $1.957m per year to insure $10m of debt for five years. Some bond prices are falling too: Over in Buenos Aires, cabinet minister Jorge Capitanich has denied that Argentina is in technical default (despite S&amp;P\u2019s ruling overnight, and the missed interest payment). Capitanich pointed out that Argentina had tried to pay the money due to restructured creditors. Those funds are locked up at Bank of New York Mellon, who are barred by Judge Griesa from advancing the funds to the creditors. Capitanich has urged bondholders to demand their money, and claimed that the mediator - Daniel Pollack - was \u201cincompetent\u201d. He also suggest Argentina could take its case to The Hague (where the Permanent Court of Arbitration is based). Here\u2019s the snaps from Reuters: ARGENTINA\u2019S CABINET CHIEF CAPITANICH SAYS GOVERNMENT HAS NO ROLE TO PLAY IN DEBT TALKS BETWEEN PRIVATE PARTIES ARGENTINA\u2019S CABINET CHIEF SAYS MEDIATOR POLLACK WAS \u201cINCOMPETENT\u201d ARGENTINA\u2019S CABINET CHIEF SAYS BONDHOLDERS HAVE TO DEMAND MONEY HELD UP BY JUDGE ARGENTINA\u2019S CABINET CHIEF SAYS ARGENTINA IS NOT IN TECHNICAL DEFAULT ARGENTINE CABINET CHIEF SAYS ARGENTINA IS STUDYING OPENING PROCEEDINGS AT THE HAGUE Argentina\u2019s mining industry could struggle to attract investment for new projects, reckons analysts at City firm Shore Capital. They write: We expect negative consequences for the Argentinean economy (notably higher inflation as a result of a weaker currency), albeit not as dire as the last time around. We expect the country\u2019s mining sector to suffer more, however, particularly those companies looking to raise funds with which to construct projects or explore the country\u2019s rich deposits. The decade-long battle between Argentina and its creditors has highlighted a major flaw in the financial system \u2013 the lack of a clear procedure for dealing with sovereign debt defaults. One was proposed a decade ago by the International Monetary Fund (they even cited Paul Singer\u2019s fund as an aggressive creditor), but the plan didn\u2019t find favour with the US. Our economics editor, Larry Elliott, argues that policymakers must try again: The danger here is all too easy to see. The legacy of the financial crisis of 2007-08 is that many countries find themselves saddled with big budget deficits. In the event of another financial crisis, something that seems all too likely, there would be a wave of sovereign debt defaults. Is the international community prepared for this? Clearly not. The imperative, therefore, is for the IMF to draw up a new blueprint for a sovereign debt mechanism and for the US to announce that it fully supports such a scheme. More here: Argentina\u2019s second debt default could have been avoided Here\u2019s our profile of Paul Singer, the hedge fund manager leading Argentina\u2019s holdout creditors (when he\u2019s not worrying that an electromagnetic pulse could destroy the world...): Profile: Argentina\u2019s nemesis, hedge fund manager Paul Singer One man, Judge Thomas Griesa, has played a crucial role in Argentina\u2019s long battle with its creditors. He\u2019s been widely criticised for ruling that its holdout creditors deserved to be paid in full, making it harder for other countries to restructure their debts. The FT has a good take. Here\u2019s a flavour: Judge Griesa has for over a decade presided over various lawsuits against Argentina by aggrieved creditors following its 2001 default. Most bondholders grudgingly accepted tough restructuring terms in 2005 and 2010, but a handful of hedge funds \u2013 led by Paul Singer\u2019s Elliott Management \u2013 have continued to pursue the Argentina through the global legal system. Doing so has been difficult. Countries are both uniquely vulnerable and impregnable to irate creditors. On one hand they do not enjoy the protection offered by a corporate or individual bankruptcy code, but it is virtually impossible to get hold of their assets \u2013 as they are mostly covered by sovereign immunity. But judge Griesa blessed Elliott\u2019s novel interpretation of a centuries-old Latin phrase most experts have dismissed as legal boilerplate, opening a chink in Argentina\u2019s armour. He ruled that the \u201cpari passu\u201d clause meant that if Buenos AIres wanted to pay its restructured bondholders it had to pay Elliott and its co-plaintiffs as well. Crucially, the octogenarian judge backed his ruling with a nuclear order - banning any financial institution with US ties from helping process Argentina\u2019s payment... More here: No winners in Argentina\u2019s \u201cGriefault\u201d debacle France\u2019s largest retailer, Carrefour, is planning to pull back its expansion plans in Argentina following the technical default, Reuters reports. Irene Mia of the Economist Intelligence Unit fears that Argentina\u2019s currency could some under pressure. She says: The default could trigger market nervousness amid the government\u2019s limited firepower to defend the peso (international reserves totalled only US$29.7bn in mid July) and an economy already in recession. A 10% or more peso depreciation is therefore a possibility, with knock out effect on inflation, real wages, interest rates and bank credit. If this happen, we will revise our growth forecast for 2014 and 2015 downward significantly\u201d Mia also predicts that Argentina will offer to swap its restructured bonds for new debt. Then it could keep repaying those creditors who agreed to take a cut after the 2001 default, and dodge the US court ruling that holdout creditors must be paid alongside everyone else (as explained at 9.56am). The news of Argentina\u2019s default could hit confidence on Wall Street. The Dow Jones index is expected to fall 100 points, or around 0.6%, when trading begins in just over three hours time. Jasper Lawler of CMC Markets says the Argentina default is \u201cjust another thorn in the side of confidence today\u201d. A more hawkish Fed, an Argentine default and Russian sanctions are taking their toll on investor confidence today, US markets closed mixed yesterday but look to open markedly lower today ahead more important earnings reports [including oil giant Exxon]. Back to Argentina... and Emiliano Surballe, fixed income analyst at Bank Julius Baer, says it\u2019s not clear what will happen next: \u201cYesterday evening, the failure of negotiations between Argentina and \u2018holdouts\u2019 (holders of defaulted debt whose claims were validated by a US court and have been due since late June) sent the country into selective default. Bonds barely reacted to the news. It is still not clear whether the credit default swap* (CDS) of the country will be triggered. The situation that generated the default was a lawsuit, not the failure of the country to transfer the proceeds to pay existing debt. \u201cThere is a lot of uncertainty as to how the situation will be managed. While the market is optimistic that a solution will be found in the next few days, execution risk is higher than that during the pre-default situation. Now, Argentina might not only have to negotiate with holdouts, it might have to reach an agreement with the holders of sovereign debt that have just defaulted.\u201d * - insurance that pays out when a country defaults on a bond The drop in eurozone inflation to a five-year low of just 0.4% is a blow to the European Central Bank, says Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight: He writes: Reinforcing the worrying news for the ECB, Spain has moved back into deflation with consumer prices falling 0.3% year-on-year in July. Furthermore, Italy was on the brink of deflation as consumer prices were only flat year-on-year in July. However, the ECB could take a little comfort from the fact that July\u2019s dip in Eurozone consumer price inflation was due entirely to a renewed year-on-year dip in energy prices (down 1.0% year-on-year after a marginal rise of 0.1% in June) and a slightly increased year-on-year fall in food, alcohol and tobacco prices (down 0.3% after a decline of 0.2% in June). The eurozone economy has slipped further towards deflation territory, with inflation hitting its lowest level since the depths of the financial crisis. The consumer prices index across the euro area has dropped to 0.4% this month, statistics group Eurostat reported, down from 0.5% in June. That\u2019s the lowest rate since October 2009, and a weaker reading than expected. It piles even more pressure on the European Central Bank to stimulate the euro economy. Falling energy prices dragged down the inflation rate, and the cost of food, alcohol and tobacco also fell. The price of manufactured goods was flat: Core inflation, stripping out food and energy costs, was unchanged at just 0.8%. The unemployment rate across the wider European Union fell to 10.2% in June, the lowest rate since March 2012: Breaking news in Europe: The eurozone jobless rate has fallen to its lowest level in 21 months. The overall unemployment rate across the euro area fell to 11.5% in June from 11.6% last month. That\u2019s the lowest rate recorded since September 2012. The lowest unemployment rates were recorded in Austria (5.0%), Germany (5.1%) and Malta (5.6%), and the highest in Greece (27.3% in April 2014) and Spain (24.5%). Europe\u2019s jobless rate is still almost double that of America (6.1%), though. Economist Megan Greene flags up that Argentina could potentially do a deal with its other creditors - swapping their existing restructured debt for new bonds issued under local law. That would allow Argentina to circumvent the US court ruling that it cannot pay the restructured bondholders unless it pays the holdouts too. She writes: One option for Argentina would be to default on its restructured bonds, offer to swap those bonds for new ones under Argentine law and\u2014free of US court rulings\u2014go on servicing them. Participation in this kind of bond exchange should be high since Argentina will have already defaulted, and so the potential alternative for creditors would be to get nothing. The great difficulty for countries that have undergone sovereign default is rebuilding their credibility in the markets so they might be able to borrow again. Under this kind of bond exchange, those participating would be getting paid as promised, so Argentina would hardly lose credibility.... Argentina\u2019s stock market could take a tumble when trading begins later today. It had hit an all-time high last night, up 7%, on hopes of a last-minute deal. Brian Joseph, head trader at local brokerage Puente, told the WSJ: \u201cThe market reaction won\u2019t be positive...\u201d \u201cThere were big expectations of a deal. This isn\u2019t good news.\u201d The U.S.-traded shares of several prominent Argentine financial services and energy firms fell Wednesday in after-hours trading, with Grupo Financiero Galicia diving 22%. Stephen Baines, bond investment manager at Kames Capital, agrees that the global markets aren\u2019t being rocked by the Argentinian situation: Here\u2019s some legal comment from Mark Stefanini, litigator at international law firm Mayer Brown \u201cArgentina has elected to isolate itself from international capital markets rather than pay its holdout creditors. It remains to be seen whether approaches such as a new bond swap for bonds governed by Argentine law and jurisdiction will be attempted to enable Argentina to avoid the full economic consequences of this decision. \u201cArgentina has chosen to avoid the risk of incurring further liability to restructured bondholders under the \u2018Rights Upon Future Offers\u2019 (RUFO) clause [see previous post] and to maintain its defiant resistance but in doing so, she faces economic consequences that are far more difficult to quantify. In the face of this defiance, holdouts may well redouble their efforts to obtain access to Argentine assets overseas using the additional discovery ordered by the Supreme Court on 16 June as a starting point resulting in further cases developing the sovereign immunity laws of relevant jurisdictions.\u201d The holdout creditors, led by NML Capital (part of Elliott Capital), have already shown an appetite for chasing Argentinian assets. In 2012, they forced an Argentinian navy ship to be detained for 10 weeks in Ghana. These holdout hedge funds hold around $1.5bn of Argentinian bonds which the country defaulted on in 2001. They mopped them up in the financial markets, at hefty discounts, after the default, and successfully persuaded a US judge that they should be repaid in full. So why can\u2019t Argentina just pay them off? The problem is that if Buenos Aires does settle in full, it would be forced to offer the same terms to the investors who agreed to restructure their bonds. That clause is called \u201cRights Upon Future Offers\u201d, and could potentially unleash $120bn of additional claims on Argentina. The Wall Street Journal has pulled together a handy graph comparing Argentina\u2019s economy now and in 2001, at the last default. European stock markets have shaken off the Argentinian default news. The FTSE 100 index of blue-chip shares is up 0.2% in early trading, and the other major indices are steady too. Yesterday, Argentina\u2019s stock market surged almost 7% on optimism that a last-minute compromise could be hammered out. A religious debt relief group, Jubilee USA Network, has also condemned the funds who triggered Argentina\u2019s latest default by demanding full repayment. Eric LeCompte, its executive director, argues that the world needs a better system to handle the fallout when a country can\u2019t repay its borrowings: \u201cBecause of the precedent this case sets there are a lot of losers and few winners. Legitimate investors and poor people lose the most. Argentina never would have defaulted and hold-outs would have been forced to sit at the table if we had an international bankruptcy process in place. In the coming months we\u2019ll continue to see the G20 to the IMF try to stop this extreme predatory behavior. Sarah-Jayne Clifton, Director of Jubilee Debt Campaign, reckons Argentina was right to resist paying the \u201cpredatory\u201d vulture funds in full. Clifton says: \u201cThankfully this time the default is unlikely to have a serious impact on Argentina. Its first default in 2001 actually kick-started economic recovery.\u201d \u201cPaying the vulture funds, on the other hand, would be genuinely disastrous, leading to billions of dollars in counter-claims from other holders of the debt. This case will have a deeply troubling global impact, making it harder for countries across the world to resolve future debt crises.\u201d Argentina\u2019s last default, in late 2001, came after a major political and economic crisis; scores were killed in riots, and both the president and the economy minister resigned (corrected) This isn\u2019t expected to happen this time \u2013 Argentina remains solvent, and has the money to keep paying its other creditors (it\u2019s just not allowed to, unless it also pays the holdout bondholders in full) But today\u2019s default is still a blow to Argentina\u2019s economy, which fell into recession last month. While the government itself is still locked out of the credit markets following the 2001 default, Argentinian companies are likely to face higher borrowing costs. As Reuters puts it: Even a short default will raise companies\u2019 borrowing costs, pile more pressure on the peso, drain dwindling foreign reserves and fuel one of the world\u2019s highest inflation rates. Robin Bew of the Economist Intelligence Unit also predicts further economic pain: Good morning. Argentina has defaulted for the second time in 13 years. Last-ditch talks between finance minister Axel Kicillof and \u201cvulture\u201d bond holders failed to deliver a deal overnight, meaning Argentina has been unable to meet payments to other creditors. Credit rating firm Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s has ruled that Argentina was now in selective default. At a dramatic press conference in New York, Kicillof declared that Argentina wasn\u2019t prepared to be extorted by the holdout bondholders. They are demanding to be paid in full on debt which Argentina defaulted on in 2001. A defiant Kicillof said: \u201cWe\u2019re not going to sign an agreement that jeopardizes the future of all Argentines,\u201d \u201cArgentines can remain calm because tomorrow will just be another day and the world will keep on spinning.\u201d The default comes two months after a US court ruled that Argentina must pay the holdouts in full; even though other creditors had agreed to restructure their debts after the 2001 default. Shortly before the 5am BST deadline, Daniel Pollack, the court-appointed mediator confirmed that the talks had broken down. Pollack said: \u201cUnfortunately, no agreement was reached and the Republic of Argentina will imminently be in default.\u201d The world financial markets are not expected to panic \u2013 this case has been running for years, so investors have been anticipating an Argentinian default for some time. However, default could prove painful for the Argentinian people. As Pollack put it: The full consequences of default are not predictable, but they certainly are not positive. I\u2019ll be tracking the reaction to the Argentina situation, and other news through the day...",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "In a week when BP's involvement in Russia once again raised concern among investors, the City can draw consolation from the fact that chief executive Bob Dudley is a veteran of the country's perilous politics. In 2008 Dudley was the boss of the oil and gas group's profitable joint venture, TNK-BP: an uneasy alliance with four Russian oligarchs. In July that year he was forced to flee the country as he warned of an \"orchestrated campaign of harassment\" amid expectations he could be seized on trumped-up visa charges. This time, Dudley faces questions over the BP's near-20% stake in Rosneft, the Kremlin-controlled oil group that has been dragged into the latest round of EU sanctions through restrictions on the export to Russia of hi-tech equipment for extracting fossil fuels. The shareholding in Russia's largest oil group is a legacy of BP's exit from TNK-BP, when BP sold its shareholding in the joint venture to Rosneft. Fadel Gheit, an oil analyst at the New York-based Oppenheimer brokerage, says that Russia has been one of the best investments ever made by BP. But the investment community is always wary of the place. \"The fact is that BP has always been willing to take calculated risks whether its going into Russia, through its extensive trading activities or running its balance sheet at a high level. It works for them. It's a spicy food. Some like it hot.\" Dudley, who was raised in Mississippi but experienced many ice cold Moscow winters, is clearly one of them. In the wake of his Moscow flight, Dudley not only stayed with BP outside Russia but ended up winning the top job inside the company. He replaced Tony Hayward following the Deepwater Horizon accident in the Gulf of Mexico of 2010, then went on to mastermind an astonishing rapprochement with Russia through the TNK-BP share deal with Rosneft. If that move \u2013 consummated last year \u2013 looked then like a brave personal and corporate move for Dudley and BP then it looks today like an dangerous gamble, some would argue. On top of the sanctions threat, this week Europe's most senior arbitration court ruled that a significant amount of the assets held by Rosneft had fallen into its hands following an illegal expropriation of holdings belonging to another privately-owned oil group in Russia, Yukos. A group of investors, who have been awarded $50bn (\u00a330bn) worth of damages by the court in the Hague court, has already warned it may come looking for BP to secure payment. On Thursday the European court of human rights ordered that a further \u20ac1.9bn (\u00a31.5bn) in compensation should be paid to former shareholders in Yukos. But Russia has always held a great allure for BP. The group's first half financial results this week gave a glimpse why, with a profit share and dividend payment from Rosneft worth over \u00a31.3bn. And Dudley remains convinced that his move to sell up the stake in TNK-BP and accept some of the proceeds through a stake in Rosneft was the right thing to do. \"We absolutely stand by strategically what we have done. We are very, very long-term investors. We work in countries that have ups and downs.\" But at the same time the company spelled out the risks facing it. \"If further international sanctions are imposed on Rosneft or new sanctions are imposed on Russia or other Russian individuals or entities, this could have a materially adverse impact on our relationship with and investment in Rosneft, our business and strategic objectives in Russia and our financial position and results of operations,\" it said in a statement. BP is not alone in its interest in Russia with ExxonMobil, Total and many other of the western oil \"majors\" holding joint ventures or other important ties with either Rosneft, Gazprom or another local players. Russia after all holds the largest gas reserves in the world and the third largest producer of oil after Saudi Arabia and the US. Shell has a major commitment to the country, not least through its liquefied natural gas (LNG) scheme at Sakhalin in eastern Russia but other companies have recently signed deals to explore for shale in Siberia and search for hydrocarbons in the Arctic. Shell has had its own difficult experience in Russia when it faced a series of claims by the environmental watchdog that it had broken a variety of regulations at Sakhalin. These claims stopped after it gave in to pressure from Gazprom to sell off part of its stake leaving many Western commentators to conclude the Anglo-Dutch group was being harassed for political reasons, something the Kremlin denied. BP was encouraged to sell its stake in TNK-BP for an initial $12.5bn in cash plus an 18.5% stake \u2013 now raised to 20% \u2013 when its private sector partners succumbed to its own pressure from Rosneft. BP pointed out that it bought its original half share in TNK for $8bn and took $19bn in dividends over the years. But there were those who wondered whether the tie-up with Rosneft was a good idea and whether it would have been done if BP had more options. The company was still reeling from the impact of the Macondo blowout and the billions of dollars that it had been forced to pay out for clean up and compensation. North America is still its single most important region \u2013 as well as a key investor base \u2013 and yet BP had seriously damaged its reputation with the fire at the Texas City refinery, a nasty pipeline fracture in Alaska and then the Deepwater Horizon accident which created the worst environmental disaster. While many companies such as Shell have moved into the Arctic as a new frontier for oil and gas, BP pulled out of Greenland amid speculation that its involvement would be inflammatory in the eyes of Greenpeace and others. Instead the group, whose share price yet to fully recover from Deepwater accident, has concentrated its fire power on places such as Azerbaijan, Angola and Iraq as well as rebuilding operations in the Gulf of Mexico where it remains the biggest single operator. BP shares are still trading on a near 20% discount to the rest of the sector but City analysts said project delivery and the threat of sanctions against Moscow remain key risks. Neil Morton, at Investec Securities, noted drily after the cheerfully good first half figures that \"reading BP's quarterly results is arguably a more useful exercise for law students than for financial investors. Russia has now been added to the litany of (mostly Macondo) legal risks.\"",

      "bodyText": "Leading shares seemed to belatedly decide an Argentinian default and a possible US interest rate rise, not to mention sanctions against Russia over Ukraine, might have some negative implications. So after a fairly calm start, supported by a number of positive company updates, the FTSE 100 saw losses accelerate during the afternoon, with the leading index finally finishing 43.33 points lower at 6730.11.

      "bodyText": "Santander has increased its provision for the mis-selling of payment protection insurance (PPI), adding to the mounting cost of the scandal for the banking industry. The \u00a365m additional cost to the UK arm of the Spanish bank dented its first half profits, which were also knocked by a series of other provisions such as \u00a3304m for an IT upgrade, but benefited from changes to the pension scheme. Ana Bot\u00edn, chief executive of the UK business, said 45% of the complaints being received for PPI were from customers who had never had a policy from the bank and warned that the situation could force further provisions in the future. It took its first provision for PPI in June 2011, for \u00a3751m, and has received claims from 323 separate claims management companies. Bot\u00edn, who is preparing the business for a stock market flotation, said one in four customers switching their current accounts were moving to Santander, which has embarked on a high profile advertising campaign of its 123 current account.

A potential sale has been delayed since 2010 and Bot\u00edn said that it would not happen in 2014. But she said: \"We are making very good progress and excited by what is behind the numbers.\" Without the provisions, the bank made a pre-tax profit of \u00a3545m, up from \u00a3461m a year ago.

The company said the value of its stake in Shui Jing Fang, which opened its first distillery in 1408, dived after sales tumbled 78% in the year to 30 June amid heavy price competition from rival brands and action by the Chinese government to curb use of luxury goods by officials. Scotch also took a hit, with Johnnie Walker Black Label's sales down 28% in the country. The crackdown has affected a number of western luxury brand's hopes in the fast-growing economy, with cognac maker R\u00e9my Cointreau and British clothing brand Burberry among those affected. Growth in China's luxury market slowed to about 2% in 2013 from 7% in 2012, according to consultancy Bain. Diageo paid \u00a3250m for a controlling 40% stake in Shui Jing Fang in 2012 when sales of luxury goods were burgeoning in China. But a change of government later that year led to a crackdown on corruption, announced by China's president, Xi Jinping, in 2013. Overall sales at the Smirnoff and Bailey's maker dropped 8.5% to \u00a313.9bn as economic and political issues in Thailand and slipping sales of Guinness in Europe and the US also hit performance. Pre-tax profits slid 11.4% to \u00a32.7bn as the strength of the pound against several international currencies including the Turkish lira and the South African rand also contributed to the profits fall. Ivan Menezes, chief executive, said: \"Our regional performance has been mixed.\" But he added: \"The catalysts for a near-term recovery of consumer spend in the emerging markets are still weak; however the future growth drivers for this industry, its aspirational nature as consumers in the emerging markets see increasing disposable income, are undiminished.\" In the UK, sales rose 2% amid a strong year for Baileys, which was boosted by the Chocolat Luxe spirit which sold well over Christmas.",

    "webTitle": "Profile: Argentina's nemesis, hedge fund manager Paul Singer", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Paul Singer is not your average Wall Street hedge fund manager. He fits the stereotype in certain ways \u2013 he's incredibly rich, a recurrent funder of the Republican party and is the investor most closely associated with bringing Argentina to its latest default. But he has another, less conventional, side. When a 2011 vote to legalise gay marriage in New York state was facing defeat, he persuaded a group of hedge fund managers to throw campaign funds at twitchy Republicans who were worried their support might provoke the party's conservative wing to unseat them, This money was said to have swung the vote. Meanwhile, as his actions have helped push Argentina towards its latest financial Armageddon, Singer has also emerged as a man with unconventional views about the whole world coming to an end. He recently broke off from his theories on finance to reveal his concerns about an electromagnetic pulse destroying the world. In his latest note to investors in his Elliott Management hedge fund, which has been seen by the Financial Times, he wrote: \"While these pages are typically chock-full of scary or depressing scenarios, there is one risk that is head and shoulders above all the rest. \"Even horrendous nuclear war, except in its most extreme form, can be a relatively localised issue, and the threat from asteroids can (possibly) be mitigated. The risks associated with an electromagnetic pulse, or EMP, represent another story entirely.\" It is not quite clear where his interest in EMP comes from, although the genesis of his devotion to gay rights is very clear. His son Andrew, a doctor in New York, married his husband in Massachusetts in 2009 and Singer talked at Davos this year about how his son's coming out transformed his perspective \"about gender and sexuality, and I became very enthusiastic about his efforts to stop discrimination\". Still, despite the unconventional views for a Republican hedge fund billionaire, Singer remains best known as the founder of Elliott Management, which controls about $17bn (\u00a310bn) from its New York offices, and his strategy of buying distressed debt. The plan revolves around acquiring loans that governments have been struggling to repay and can therefore be snapped up at large discounts. Singer then aims to either sell them on for a profit when the country's circumstances improve or sue for full payment. Such investors are usually known as \"vulture funds\" \u2013 a term Singer is known to despise. But whatever you call it, the strategy has proved profitable. Singer's triumphs in this sphere include spending $20m in 1995 on defaulted debt from Peru, and then successfully suing for $58m. He has also acquired a $30m debt owed by Congo-Brazzaville at a cut-down price, and was awarded more than $100m in interest in 2002 and 2003. So Argentina merely represents his latest move in this lucrative trade. The case has revolved around a decade-long legal fight between the Argentine government and a group of hedge funds led by Singer, who are owed debts which date back to the collapse of the Argentine economy in the early 2000s. Unlike more than 90% of the other Argentina bondholders, Singer and his group refused to restructure their investment, and argued that the country could not legally favour bondholders who restructured their debt over his group. Singer won the court battle, resulting in the south American country defaulting again this week, as holders of the restructured debt didn't receive hundreds of millions in interest payments. It is still unclear exactly how all this will play out, but despite Singer's track record of victories in his varied campaigns, he doesn't always end on the winning team. In 2012 he memorably tracked the course of a Argentine navy ship, Libertad. When it arrived in Ghana, he persuaded one of the country's judges to hold the vessel in port until he was paid the millions owed to him. Argentina won that round, successfully arguing in the international tribunal for the law of the sea that the ship should be returned. In May the French stock market regulator AMF said it had fined Singer's Elliott Management and its UK arm Elliott Advisors \u20ac8m (\u00a36.4m) each over insider trading relating to French motorways operator APRR. The firm said it would appeal against the punishment. Elliott Management did not respond to the Guardian's request for comment.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Argentina's second debt default in little more than a decade should never have happened. It has been both entirely predictable and entirely preventable. The problem is simple. Individuals and corporations have recourse to bankruptcy codes that give them protection from their creditors. Sovereign states do not. A plan to remedy this omission was floated by Anne Krueger, then deputy managing director of the International Monetary Fund in the early 2000s. It was strangled at birth by the US Treasury, spurred on by Wall Street. In place of a sovereign debt bankruptcy mechanism, the IMF backed collective action clauses (CAC), designed to allow a country to do a deal with the vast bulk of its creditors that would apply to all bondholders. But CACs have proved to be no panacea. They take an eternity to negotiate and can still be challenged by creditors, as the legal action taken against Argentina in the New York courts shows. So what happens now? The immediate reaction of the financial markets to the default was muted, in part because the default came as no surprise and in part because there is an assumption that a deal will be cobbled together over the next few days. Given that both sides in this dispute have dug in their heels so far, it may not be. Failure to settle matters rapidly will have consequences for Argentina. Although South America's second biggest economy is in a less parlous state than it was at the time of the first default in 2001, growth has slowed to a standstill and inflation is already running at double-digit levels. Argentina is still unable to borrow on the global financial markets, so the new default will have no impact there. But the peso is likely to come under downward pressure, making imports more expensive and thus pushing up inflation. As ever, the poorest and the weakest will suffer most. There are wider implications. If the so-called \"vulture funds\" that have brought the current action emerge victorious, it will not only encourage legal action in other cases where creditors have been forced to take a \"haircut\" but will make future debt restructurings more difficult to organise. The danger here is all too easy to see. The legacy of the financial crisis of 2007-08 is that many countries find themselves saddled with big budget deficits. In the event of another financial crisis, something that seems all too likely, there would be a wave of sovereign debt defaults. Is the international community prepared for this? Clearly not. The imperative, therefore, is for the IMF to draw up a new blueprint for a sovereign debt mechanism and for the US to announce that it fully supports such a scheme.",

      "body": "<p>Argentina's second debt default in little more than a decade should never have happened. It has been both entirely predictable and entirely preventable.</p> <p>The problem is simple. Individuals and corporations have recourse to bankruptcy codes that give them protection from their creditors. Sovereign states do not. A plan to remedy this omission was floated by Anne Krueger, then deputy managing director of the International Monetary Fund in the early 2000s. It was strangled at birth by the US Treasury, spurred on by Wall Street.</p> <p>In place of a sovereign debt bankruptcy mechanism, the IMF backed collective action clauses (CAC), designed to allow a country to do a deal with the vast bulk of its creditors that would apply to all bondholders. But CACs have proved to be no panacea. They take an eternity to negotiate and can still be challenged by creditors, as the legal action taken against Argentina in the New York courts shows.</p> <p>So what happens now? The immediate reaction of the financial markets to the default was muted, in part because the default came as no surprise and in part because there is an assumption that a deal will be cobbled together over the next few days. Given that both sides in this dispute have dug in their heels so far, it may not be.</p> <p>Failure to settle matters rapidly will have consequences for Argentina. Although South America's second biggest economy is in a less parlous state than it was at the time of the first default in 2001, growth has slowed to a standstill and inflation is already running at double-digit levels. Argentina is still unable to borrow on the global financial markets, so the new default will have no impact there. But the peso is likely to come under downward pressure, making imports more expensive and thus pushing up inflation. As ever, the poorest and the weakest will suffer most.</p> <p>There are wider implications. If the so-called \"vulture funds\" that have brought the current action emerge victorious, it will not only encourage legal action in other cases where creditors have been forced to take a \"haircut\" but will make future debt restructurings more difficult to organise.</p> <p>The danger here is all too easy to see. The legacy of the financial crisis of 2007-08 is that many countries find themselves saddled with big budget deficits. In the event of another financial crisis, something that seems all too likely, there would be a wave of sovereign debt defaults.</p> <p>Is the international community prepared for this? Clearly not. The imperative, therefore, is for the IMF to draw up a new blueprint for a sovereign debt mechanism and for the US to announce that it fully supports such a scheme.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Serious Fraud Office has agreed to pay tycoon Robert Tchenguiz \u00a31.5m in damages and unspecified legal costs, in a settlement it hopes will draw a line under a botched investigation into the collapse of Icelandic banks. His brother, Vincent Tchenguiz, was last week awarded \u00a33m in damages and \u00a33m in legal costs by the SFO. The final bill for the brothers' legal fees has yet to be agreed, and in Robert's case could be decided by a judge if the two sides cannot settle. The \u00a31.5m damages settlement, which must be paid in 14 days, will be a relief for the SFO, which has seen its reputation battered after its investigation into the Tchenguiz brothers, then its biggest fraud inquiry, collapsed in disarray. The SFO had been investigating the brothers in connection with the collapse of the troubled Icelandic bank Kaupthing, which went under during the 2008 banking crisis. The two brothers had been seeking \u00a3300m in damages after the high court ruled that the warrants used to search their homes and offices in 2011 were unlawful. A judge accused the SFO of \"sheer incompetence\" after it admitted it had no good records of information used to obtain warrants to search Vincent Tchenguiz's home. Robert Tchenguiz, who was filing for false imprisonment and damage to his business empire, had not joined the settlement last week, leaving the SFO facing another round of expensive legal action. He said at the time of his arrest in March 2011 that it had an \"immediate and devastating impact\" on his family, business interests and reputation. David Green, the SFO director who inherited the case, said: \"I am pleased that we have been able to resolve this final outstanding matter, without the need for a costly trial.\" \"On behalf of the SFO, I also apologise to Robert Tchenguiz for what happened to him. I reiterate that the SFO has changed a great deal since March 2011, and I am determined that the mistakes made over three years ago will not be repeated.\"",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Profits at Lloyds Banking Group more than halved in the first six months of the year as its bill for the payment protection insurance (PPI) scandal increased by \u00a3600m and it paid out penalties for rigging interest rates. The unexpectedly large new provision for PPI took the amount set aside by the 24% taxpayer-owned bank to \u00a310.4bn and pushed the industry's tally for the biggest mis-selling scandal in history to more than \u00a323bn. Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio, Lloyds' boss, apologised for the interest rate manipulation, which saw the bank hit with a bill of \u00a3226m on Monday. He warned that further \"legacy\" issues meant it had to make further provisions, which in total reached \u00a31.1bn in its first-half results. The bank, which has the biggest PPI bill of any lender and owns Bank of Scotland and Halifax, admitted the cost of the PPI mis-selling - it has received claims for 40% of the policies sold since 2000 - could escalate. Horta-Os\u00f3rio is preparing to present a new three-year plan to the bank's board that is likely to spark fears of bank closures and another swathe of job cuts on top of 15,000 earmarked for his first three years. At the helm since March 2011, when he broke ranks with the industry to begin paying out PPI claims, he committed to stay to \"at least\" 2017 to see through his new strategy, which will be unveiled in the autumn. The pre-tax profits of \u00a3863m \u2013 down by \u00a31.3bn from a year ago \u2013 were overshadowed by the \u00a3226m in fines imposed this week, including compensation to the Bank of England, which showed traders had been manipulating interest rates to cut fees for its emergency lifeline in the financial crisis. It was \"as shocking to us as it was to you\", he said. \"I would like to say again we feel the actions of those individuals was totally unacceptable and we condemn them without any reservation ... I am sorry for the impact the actions of these individuals have had on our customers, our colleagues and our shareholders.\" The bank's remuneration committee will be looking at the implications for bonuses for 22 individuals highlighted by regulators as well as others who may have to be penalised for the manipulation, which took place between 2006 and 2009. No commitment was made about publicising the outcome of the disciplinary proceedings, but chairman Lord Blackwell, who had to write to the Bank of England governor Mark Carney to apologise for the rate manipulation, said: \"We will look at all the options (to claw back pay) but have to act within the current law.\" The \u00a31.1bn provision also included \u00a3225m to cover ongoing regulatory issues and \u00a350m for interest-rate swaps mis-selling, where it has now provided \u00a3580m in compensation. Horta-Os\u00f3rio said these issues should not have an impact on the underlying performance, by which measure profits rose 32% to \u00a33.9bn. Bad debt provisions fell 58% to \u00a3758m.The bank is incurring \u00a3200m in costs a month for PPI and of the \u00a310.4bn provision, some \u00a32.1bn is to cover the cost of administrating claims. The UK arm of Santander also took a new \u00a365m provision for PPI after receiving claims from 300 claims management companies. The Spanish-owned bank said 45% of claims were from customers who did not have policies. The City is waiting for the government to sell off the rest of its stake in Lloyds, which has fallen from 43% at the time of the bailout. Horta-Os\u00f3rio said the bank was \"in better shape in terms of getting the taxpayers' money back\". Talks with the bank regulator the Prudential Regulation Authority about resuming dividends for the first time \u2013 after being blocked by the EU because of the bailout \u2013 will begin in the second half. Payouts from the bank, once one of the biggest dividend payers, will begin at a \"modest\" level but rise to at least 50% of earnings. The shares fell 2.8% to 74.25p \u2013 just above the 73.6p at which the government breaks even on its stake. The industry is facing an investigation by the Competition and Markets Authority, and Horta-Os\u00f3rio attempted to demonstrate competition in a market place in which Lloyds has market shares of over 18% in current accounts, mortgages and savings. He signalled growth in the future in areas such as its Black Horse finance business, which is being helped by car sales, which it has been suggested have been fuelled by PPI claims. Asked about his new strategy, he refused to comment on job cuts or say branch closures were inevitable but talked about rapid growth of digital channels. The bank also warned about impact of the Scottish vote on independence in September. \"In the event of a yes[yes] vote, the scale of potential change is currently unclear, but we have been undertaking contingency planning,\" the bank said.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "AstraZeneca has surprised the City by raising its sales and profit forecasts for this year, two months after fending off a near-\u00a370bn takeover approach from bigger US rival Pfizer. Marking the second consecutive quarter of revenue growth, the pharmaceutical firm beat City forecasts with second-quarter revenues of $6.5bn (\u00a33.8bn), up 4% at constant exchange rates, driven partly by strong sales of its new heart drug Brilinta and the newly launched diabetes treatment Farxiga. Core earnings per share were also better than expected, rising 13% to $1.30. Pre-tax profits totalled $866m. The company highlighted the progress made replenishing its pipeline of new therapies, saying it has 14 new medicines in late-stage clinical trials, compared with eight at this stage last year. Britain's second-largest drugmaker now expects full-year revenues to be similar to last year's, compared with previous expectations of a low-to-mid single digit percentage decline. This means core earnings per share are likely to fall less sharply than previously thought, in low double digits. AstraZeneca will pay a half-year dividend of 90 cents a share. This strong set of results is a boost for chief executive Pascal Soriot's defence strategy. At the time of the Pfizer approach he pledged a 75% increase in revenues to $45bn by 2023, a target that was immediately derided by analysts as overly ambitious. Some big AstraZeneca shareholders were disappointed by the board's firm rebuttal of Pfizer's advances. Soriot reiterated that Pfizer's last offer of \u00a353.50 a share, made in late May, was too low and needed to be at least 10% higher. \"We also had concerns over the execution risk around tax inversion,\" he added. Unveiling quarterly figures earlier in the week, Pfizer boss Ian Read said he was still looking at big deals that would allow his company to cut its tax bill, but refused to say whether it would have another tilt at AstraZeneca. Soriot will be able to flag AstraZeneca's progress as an independent company at an investor day scheduled for 18 November \u2013 a week before Pfizer can make another offer for the company following a six-month cooling-off period under UK takeover rules. Analysts have taken this to mean that AstraZeneca is unlikely to invite Pfizer back to the negotiating table once it is allowed to do so, from late August. Independent City analyst Louise Cooper tweeted: \"AstraZeneca results strong but should be expected. After Pfizer deal collapsed, this set of figures had to be good.\" Analysts welcomed the \"strong\" figures. Citigroup analyst Andrew Baum noted that AstraZeneca's \"robust\" second quarter had been flattered by several one-off items \u2013 including a $200m payment from Pfizer in relation to its launch of an over-the-counter version of Nexium in the US. \"Irony at work: AstraZeneca has Pfizer partially to thank for its second-quarter beat,\" he wrote in a note. AstraZeneca bought the rights to Spanish firm Almirall's lung therapies on Wednesday, the latest in a string of smaller deals to bolster its drug portfolio and fill gaps as key blockbuster medicines come off patent. Soriot was hopeful of clinching partnerships in the second half of the year for some anti-infective and neuroscience treatments, including an experimental Alzheimer's drug, to reduce AstraZeneca's development costs. He trumpeted 11% revenue growth in emerging markets, with China up 23%, making it the fastest-growing multinational in China. AstraZeneca doubled its salesforce in the country last year just before the start of the bribery scandal that has engulfed bigger rival GlaxoSmithKline, to around 4,500 people today (another 2,000 work in research and manufacturing), and stepped up its training and compliance programmes to ensure its sales reps do not fall foul of Chinese rules on corruption.",

Analysts have taken this to mean that AstraZeneca is unlikely to invite Pfizer back to the negotiating table once it is allowed to do so, from late August.</p> <p>Independent City analyst Louise Cooper tweeted: \"AstraZeneca results strong but should be expected. After Pfizer deal collapsed, this set of figures had to be good.\"</p> <p>Analysts welcomed the \"strong\" figures. Citigroup analyst Andrew Baum noted that AstraZeneca's \"robust\" second quarter had been flattered by several one-off items \u2013 including a $200m payment from Pfizer in relation to its launch of an over-the-counter version of Nexium in the US. \"Irony at work: AstraZeneca has Pfizer partially to thank for its second-quarter beat,\" he wrote in a note.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jul/30/astrazeneca-lung-drugs-almirall-deal\" title=\"\">AstraZeneca bought the rights to Spanish firm Almirall's lung therapies</a> on Wednesday, the latest in a string of smaller deals to bolster its drug portfolio and fill gaps as key blockbuster medicines come off patent. Soriot was hopeful of clinching partnerships in the second half of the year for some anti-infective and neuroscience treatments, including an experimental Alzheimer's drug, to reduce AstraZeneca's development costs.</p> <p>He trumpeted 11% revenue growth in emerging markets, with China up 23%, making it the fastest-growing multinational in China. AstraZeneca doubled its salesforce in the country last year just before the start of the bribery scandal that has engulfed bigger rival GlaxoSmithKline, to around 4,500 people today (another 2,000 work in research and manufacturing), and stepped up its training and compliance programmes to ensure its sales reps do not fall foul of Chinese rules on corruption.</p>",

They started with the release of a report by the Business Council of Australia, and were accompanied by Gina Rinehart yet again suggesting we need to be more like Africa.<br></p> <p>The great thing about Australian business leaders is they always have something to whinge about, and almost without fail the amount they have to pay their workers will be top of the list.</p> <p>On Tuesday, the Australian\u2019s front page pictured Rinehart looking across the Indian Ocean with wistful longing. Under the headline <a href=\"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/mining-energy/high-costs-hurting-mine-investment-says-gina-rinehart/story-e6frg9df-1227005014278\">High costs hurting mining</a>, she argued that an example of Australia\u2019s poor competitiveness was that \u201cRio Tinto, which has been in Australia for decades, and made most of its revenue from Australia, is now arranging multibillions of dollars of investment for a major resource project with substantial infrastructure in Guinea in Africa\u201d.</p> <p>Her positive view of Africa compared with Australia is long held. Back in 2012 she<a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-09-05/rinehart-says-aussie-workers-overpaid-unproductive/4243866\"> was saying</a> that \u201cAfricans want to work, and its workers are willing to work for less than $2 per day. Such statistics make me worry for this country\u2019s future.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s worth noting that she wasn\u2019t worried about what having people work for $2 a day in Australia would do to the social fabric of this country.</p> <p>It\u2019s also worth noting that Rio Tinto does continue to invest heavily in Australia. It\u2019s<a href=\"http://www.riotinto.com/investors/results-and-reports-2146.aspx\"> 2014 second quarter report</a> noted it has projects in Australia in the earliest stage for aluminium, copper and uranium, at the advanced stage for copper, and at the evaluation stage for copper, aluminium, uranium and iron ore.</p> <p>But yes, they also have one project for iron ore at the evaluation stage in Guinea. Who knew a multinational mining company would mine in multiple nations!</p> <p>However, as I reported<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2014/jul/21/keeping-mining-tax-wont-kill-investment\"> last week</a>, mining investment consultants Behre Dolbear judge Australia as second only to Canada as the best place for mining investment. Similarly the most recent report by the World Bank on<a href=\"http://www.doingbusiness.org/~/media/GIAWB/Doing%20Business/Documents/Annual-Reports/English/DB14-Full-Report.pdf\"> ease of doing business</a> ranked Australia as 11th out of 189 nations. Canada was ranked 19th and Guinea was rather well behind in 175th place. </p> <p>And we shouldn\u2019t think mining operations in Africa are always profitable endeavours. Yesterday Rio Tinto<a href=\"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/mining-energy/rio-tinto-sells-troubled-african-coal-assets-for-us50m/story-e6frg9df-1227007542190\"> sold its coal assets</a> in Mozambique for US$50m, having bought them in 2010 for a whopping $4bn. Ouch.</p> <p>Rinehart\u2019s statements coincided with the release of a discussion paper by the<a href=\"http://www.bca.com.au/publications/building-australias-comparative-advantages\"> Business Council of Australia</a>, Building Australia\u2019s Competitive Advantage, and an associated McKinsey &amp; Co report titled Improving Australia\u2019s Global Competitiveness.</p> <p>The McKinsey report suggested that Australia was highly competitive only in agriculture, mining, tourism, finance and international education. The report noted that competitiveness is a product of a nation\u2019s productivity and its cost of doing business.</p> <p>One way to examine this is to use the \u201creal exchange rate\u201d \u2013 that is, the exchange rate taking inflation into account. If a nation\u2019s real exchange rate rises (as Australia\u2019s has in the past five years) then it becomes less competitive.</p> <p>The question though is why this occurred.</p> <p>The real exchange rate can rise because the nominal exchange rate is rising, or it can be because inflation and labour costs are rising due to high costs and falling productivity. Since early 2009, when the Australian dollar crashed to a value of just US$0.64, our real exchange rate has risen by about 35%, but in that time the nominal exchange rate has also risen by 33.5%.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"graph one\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/5KOxj/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"480\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>So in the past five years the main reason for our declining competitiveness is the nominal exchange rate, not because our labour costs have been rising faster than other nations.</p> <p>Indeed, since 2005, Australia\u2019s real unit labour costs have fallen by more than in Britain, Canada or the US:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"graph two\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/MXsmC/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"480\" height=\"400\"></iframe> <figcaption> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Similarly, any decline in competitiveness since 2005 is not due to a drop in labour productivity since Australia\u2019s productivity growth in that time has beaten Britain, Canada, Japan and the OECD:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"graph three\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/cfxv3/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"480\" height=\"400\"></iframe> <figcaption> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Even the Business Council of Australia (BCA) acknowledges this, noting, \u201clabour productivity growth has been relatively robust over the past couple of years\u201d.

They started with the release of a report by the Business Council of Australia, and were accompanied by Gina Rinehart yet again suggesting we need to be more like Africa. The great thing about Australian business leaders is they always have something to whinge about, and almost without fail the amount they have to pay their workers will be top of the list. On Tuesday, the Australian\u2019s front page pictured Rinehart looking across the Indian Ocean with wistful longing. Under the headline High costs hurting mining, she argued that an example of Australia\u2019s poor competitiveness was that \u201cRio Tinto, which has been in Australia for decades, and made most of its revenue from Australia, is now arranging multibillions of dollars of investment for a major resource project with substantial infrastructure in Guinea in Africa\u201d. Her positive view of Africa compared with Australia is long held. Back in 2012 she was saying that \u201cAfricans want to work, and its workers are willing to work for less than $2 per day. Such statistics make me worry for this country\u2019s future.\u201d It\u2019s worth noting that she wasn\u2019t worried about what having people work for $2 a day in Australia would do to the social fabric of this country. It\u2019s also worth noting that Rio Tinto does continue to invest heavily in Australia. It\u2019s 2014 second quarter report noted it has projects in Australia in the earliest stage for aluminium, copper and uranium, at the advanced stage for copper, and at the evaluation stage for copper, aluminium, uranium and iron ore. But yes, they also have one project for iron ore at the evaluation stage in Guinea. Who knew a multinational mining company would mine in multiple nations! However, as I reported last week, mining investment consultants Behre Dolbear judge Australia as second only to Canada as the best place for mining investment.
