      "bodyText": "Stepping into the offices of Robey Warshaw, the Mayfair-based boutique bank advising on the potential blockbuster takeover of SABMiller by Anheuser-Busch InBev, is like going back in time to a world before the rise of the global investment bank. The firm, based in a discreet Georgian townhouse, consists of just nine people. There are no security guards at the entrance, no lifts to the 50th floor. Indeed, one of the bankers opens the door and takes me through to the boardroom himself. Robey Warshaw is led by a trio of bankers, Simon Robey, Simon Warshaw and Philip Apostolides, who each left their roles at giant \u201cbulge-bracket\u201d banks to focus on what they enjoyed most \u2013 working with clients, being in their boardrooms, and not having to deal with the administration and management they have left behind. To say the business plan appears to be working is something of an understatement. Not only has SABMiller hired the firm, among others, to advise on AB InBev\u2019s potential \u00a360bn-plus approach, but it is also working for BG Group on the \u00a347bn deal with Shell. The firm is also advising insurer RSA, subject of a bid by rival Zurich, and it assisted the London Stock Exchange with its takeover of US investment firm Frank Russell. It also advised pharmaceuticals giant AstraZeneca in its politically charged defence of a near-\u00a370bn bid from America\u2019s Pfizer last year. Even before this year\u2019s big deals, revenues last year reached nearly \u00a324m. The accounts show a profit of \u00a39.4m provisionally attributable to the highest-earning member of the firm, believed to be Robey. Robey, a former co-head of global mergers and acquisitions at Morgan Stanley, is one of the best connected bankers in the City. Warshaw was one of the stars at UBS, the Swiss bank, and brought a bookful of relationships and contacts with him when he decided to start a new career two years ago. His last UBS deal involved advising Vodafone on the \u00a381bn sale of its stake in Verizon, the deal of 2013. Banking experts say the appeal of the micro investment bank is that it is everything that the multinational giants are not. Above all, being small, it is discreet. \u201cIf you\u2019re thinking of launching a takeover bid and you bring in a big bank, you know that immediately you will be bringing in loads of people into the group. This raises the possibility of leaks,\u201d says one source. \u201cWhereas with a micro boutique, you\u2019re dealing with just one or two bankers. \u201cAlso, the bigger banks have all kinds of different trading arms and lending arms, and their focus is more commoditised these days and not necessarily aimed at giving straightforward strategic advice.\u201d Last year, Cenkos, a medium-sized investment bank, stunned its bigger rivals by pulling together a flotation for the AA roadside assistance group on its own, after spending months with the management team and then getting one or two key institutions to invest in the deal. That move rattled the bigger banks, which have whole teams set up to approach potential investors in a somewhat mechanical fashion but cannot necessarily spend the time on the initial contacts. \u201cOur business is all about volume,\u201d one senior executive says. Many say there has been a drift of experienced talent away from the bigger banks that has helped smaller rivals and micro boutiques such as Ondra or Zaoui &amp; Co, founded by Michael and Yoel Zaoui, brothers formerly at Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs. For example, Ian Hannam, the so-called \u201cking of mining\u201d, who was one of US bank JP Morgan\u2019s top dealmakers in London, left the firm after being fined by the regulator in 2012 for market abuse. There are many excellent bankers at JP Morgan now, but few have Hannam\u2019s strength of character or profile. And Rupert Hume-Kendall, another well-connected dealmaker, recently retired from Bank of America Merrill Lynch, despite only being in his early 50s. Indeed, many successful bankers don\u2019t feel the need to continue their careers past that age. There are still well-connected operators with experience at the big firms \u2013 Karen Cook, Mark Sorrell and Anthony Gutman at Goldman Sachs, for example. But Barclays, following the exit of Bob Diamond, is unquestionably diminishing in importance in this area and Deutsche Bank is going through a difficult time following the departure of co-head Anshu Jain in June. The boutique investment bank is not a novel concept \u2013 there have been plenty in the past, such as Greenhill and Moelis \u2013 but with the rise of the ultra-small operation we may be seeing something new. For the time being the likes of Robey Warshaw, Zaoui and Ondra \u2013 whose revenues in the year to March 2014 hit \u00a341m \u2013 are making hay.",

The AA: from roadside rescuer to \u2018key opportunity\u2019 There was a time when the AA was considered the most stalwart of organisations.

Irritatingly, Johnson was convicted and patrolman Jones arrested and charged with perjury, but the AA still came to the rescue: risking bankruptcy by staking all its funds to get an acquittal \u2013 which it eventually won. These days, it\u2019s not clear if your roadside recovery fee includes scouts prepared to do a stretch with you, but there are still plenty in the City who reckon that the company provides a convincing defence.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Research released this week by the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling (Natsem) on behalf of Anglicare, on living standard trends in Australia, displays a bleak outlook for the decade ahead, with inequality growing and the living standards of the poorest actually declining. The release of the latest income and wealth figures have highlighted that inequality grew during the mining-boom years and that over the past two years high incomes rose while others stagnated. Such figures, however, only look at the past and don\u2019t provide insight into the future. While Natsem\u2019s report focuses on the changes in living standards over the decade from 2004 to 2014, it also uses its Stinmod model of the Australian tax and transfer system to project forward to 2024. The picture is bleak across the board, but especially so for Australia\u2019s poorest. The Natsem figures echo those of the bureau of statistics, which show that the highest income households saw their standard of living rise by the most from 2004-2014. During that decade, Natsem estimates households in the top 20% saw their standard of living grow by 28.4% compared with 21.6% for median income households and 15.1% for the poorest 20%: But looking out to the next 10 years we see a sharp decline in the growth of living standards. Gone is the supercharged growth that occurred over the past 10 years \u2013 a decade which included the global financial crisis. Instead of 28.4% growth, the richest households are projected to see their living standards improve by just 5.9% by 2024. But that meagre amount counts as wondrous compared with other households. Median-income households will effectively see their living standards remain flat \u2013 they\u2019re projected to rise by 0.2%, a figure so negligible that it might as well be zero. But just staying flat would be great for the poorer households. Those in the second-poorest 20% of households are expected to see their standard of living fall by 1.3%, while the poorest can expect a 4.5% decline over the next 10 years. The big drivers of the difference are lower economic growth and weaker wage growth over the next 10 years than was experienced from 2004 and, crucially, the changes to welfare benefits in the 2014 and 2015 budgets. Among these changes were \u201cthe removal of some welfare payments, reductions in other payments, and changes to indexation arrangements that reduce some payment increases over time\u201d. The difference in the growth of living standards varies as well across types of families. Natsem noted that over the past decade \u201ccouple families with children experienced the strongest gains in their living standards while single parents had the lowest gains\u201d: As with the breakdown of growth by living standards, all family types on average are expected to see slower improvement in living standards over the next 10 years than they did in the past decade. But it is when we focus on the poorest 40% of such family types that the big impacts of the past (and last?) two Hockey budgets is revealed. While the couples with children will see on average a 5.6% growth in living standards over the next 10 years, the living standards of such households within the poorest 40% of households are expected to see a 3.2% decline: The report notes that most of the falls in living standards are due \u201cmainly\u201d to \u201ccuts to family payments\u201d. It notes as well that for households without children, \u201cthe largest cuts will be to some pensioner families \u2013 who lose some, or all of their part-pension\u201d. Where the real impact is seen is in the difference in income growth over the next 10 years by households on welfare benefits. While, not surprisingly, non-benefit households enjoy a much higher standard of living than those who do rely on benefits such as the aged pension, disability support pension and the sole parenting payment, the forecasts over the next 10 years show the gap increasing: Natsem estimates in 2004 dollar terms, the disposable income for non-benefit households rose from $781 a week in 2004 to $948 a week in 2014. By comparison, the disposable income for households reliant on the aged pension went from $350 per week in 2004 to $425 in 2014. The weaker growth for non-benefit households reflects that seen in all other categories \u2013 their standard of living will grow by just 2.9% from 2014-224 compared with the 22.0% observed over the past 10 years. But most households reliant on benefits will either see their living standards stay flat or actually decline. Among the biggest drop is for those existing on the sole parenting payment. Such households can expect an 8.3% drop in living standards: As the report notes, \u201cthe major welfare change for single parents has been the removal of single parents from the parenting payment once the oldest child turns eight years of age\u201d. The policy was introduced in 2006 by the Howard government and updated in 2013 by the Gillard government when it ended the grandfathering of existing beneficiaries. Rather than stay on the parenting payment, once the youngest child turned eight they are now moved on the much less generous Newstart. Apart from saving money for the government, such a move was sold as being done to boost labour participation of such parents (mostly women). But the report finds that there is no \u201cstrong evidence of an increase in their labour force participation\u201d. Any increase in participation after 2006 was essentially a continuation of that observed prior to the welfare changes. And since 2013, when the Gillad government changes came into effect, Natsem has found no \u201cevidence of gains for single parents in terms of participation\u201d compared with the total female participation rate. Thus it is unlikely the policy will have any material impact on labour force participation over the next decade, but it will definitely have an impact on living standards. In 2004, sole parent payment households had a disposable income roughly 42% that of non-benefit households. By 2014 this had declined slightly to 41.5%; but by 2024, under the new arrangements this will see a fall to just 37%: Worst of all will be households on \u201callowances\u201d such as Newstart, the partnered parenting payment and the youth allowance. Such households will see their weekly disposable income fall from the current level of 33.5% of non-benefit households to 29.2% by 2024 \u2013 well below the 39.3% level that existed in 2004. The report shows that the increases in inequality that occurred during the past 10 years were essentially hidden because at least most households on average saw significant increase in standard of living. But over the next 10 years, with lower overall economic growth expected, the picture is one of inequality growing but with some households \u2013 notably the poorest \u2013 seeing their living standards actually decline. The measures contained in the past two budgets and some decisions from previous years have meant that all boats will not be lifted by a rising tide of economic growth. Not only is the tide expected to rise by much less than in the past, the budget decisions have put some sizeable holes into the hulls of the boats carrying the poorest in society.",
