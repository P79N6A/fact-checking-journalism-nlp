      "bodyText": "Budget gym operator Pure Gym has acquired one of the fitness industry\u2019s best-known high street brands, LA fitness, as it flexes its low-cost ethos in the face of costlier rivals. Pure Gym said the sites used by its mid-market competitor would be given a no-frills makeover, which means commandeering back office space and closing pools and saunas to fit in more machines and members. Commentators have described the takeover as illustrative of a split in the UK fitness market between low-cost clubs such as Pure Gym, which charge memberships by the month, and high-end gyms with annual contracts and specialist training. The purchase brings the number of gyms under the Pure Gym umbrella to 141 with a further 16 expected to open this year. LA fitness launched in the early 1990s and was one of the fitness industry\u2019s founding gym brands. Founded in 2009, Pure Gym is majority owned by the US private equity firm CCMP Capital. Until the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) approves Pure Gym\u2019s plans, the businesses will operate separately. If the regulator decides that some of the LA fitness gyms cannot be changed to Pure Gym clubs for competition reasons, it is likely they will be sold on. Pure Gym\u2019s chief executive, Humphrey Cobbold, said the model of monthly rolling memberships or paying for one-off visits will be put in place in the revamped LA fitness sites, getting rid of the 12- and 18-month contracts which had been typical up to now. Cobbold was appointed chief executive of the gym chain in January after joining from cycling retailer Wiggle. A fitness enthusiast, he hails from the Cobbold brewing family from Suffolk which in previous generations produced a governor of the Bank of England. When an LA fitness gym is closed for its makeover, the members will be informed and will not be charged while the site is shut. When the gym reopens, their membership will be restarted on the monthly contract model, unless the member asks to leave. \u201cIf they say \u2018I don\u2019t want to be a part of that gym\u2019 then we will say \u2018OK we will not take any money from you\u2019,\u201d Cobbold said. The small number of customers who have paid their subscriptions upfront will be reimbursed. When clubs have changed over to the Pure Gyms brand in the past, Cobbold said, typically more than half of the members transfer. Monthly Pure Gym membership costs range between \u00a39.99 to \u00a326.99, although the prices may increase for some central London clubs, Cobbold added, with typical LA fitness contracts costing between \u00a330 and \u00a365 a month. The arrival of budget gym operators in recent years has put pressure on clubs in the mid- and high end of the market. Newcastle United owner Mike Ashley has also joined the fray with a commitment to open a chain of Sports Direct gyms, the first of which is in Aintree. Ray Algar, a fitness industry analyst, said he expects low-cost gyms to continue building momentum but also for there to be a rise in the number of people attending specialist \u201cboutique-style\u201d studios, where experts run classes. \u201cI see the UK health and fitness market bifurcating or forking along two distinct pathways \u2013 self-service and supported. Many consumers have steadily been taking control of activities once outsourced to others \u2013 self-scanning our groceries, booking hotels and flight tickets \u2013 and enjoy the empowering feeling of serving ourselves,\u201d he said. \u201cLow-cost gyms have tapped this phenomenon very effectively, attracting members seeking a narrow \u2013 machine-based \u2013 fitness experience and content to serve themselves. However, perhaps less conspicuous is the second pathway, which I describe as supported, where customers seek and pay for a more guided experience. This is where the very best specialist studios are to be found purposely engaged in helping customers reach a desired health and wellbeing aspiration.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The continuing uncertainty over Greece as talks to resolve its financial crisis continue over the weekend has pushed shares sharply lower once more. The usual conflicting comments from various parties unsettled investors, with an increasing number of insiders now talking about a possible Greek exit from the eurozone. Added to the downbeat mood were US figures showing GDP contracted by 0.7% in the first quarter. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 fell 56.49 points or 0.8% at 6984.43 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 2.26% to 11,413.82 France\u2019s Cac closed 2.53% lower at 5007.89 The Athens market lost 1.44% to 825.38 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 54 points or 0.3%. On that note it\u2019s time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back next week. More optimism from Greece: Back to Greece, and the country could still stay in the euro even if it defaults (remember it has \u20ac1.6bn to pay to the IMF next month.) That\u2019s the view of Moody\u2019s ratings agency in a note seen by the Financial Times. It quotes Moody\u2019s saying: \u201cA Greek exit from the euro is not an inevitable consequence of default. The decision to split would be a political act.\u201d The FT report is here (\u00a3): Here\u2019s our story on the US GDP figures: A harsh winter, a strong dollar and falling oil prices took their toll on the US economy in the first quarter, the Commerce Department revealed on Friday. US gross domestic product (GDP) \u2013 the broadest measure of economic growth \u2013 shrank at an annualized rate of 0.7%. The Commerce Department had previously estimated output grew 0.2% from January through March. The quarterly economic decline is the first since the economy shrank by an even sharper 2.1% annual rate in the first quarter of 2014. A bleak winter also contributed to that decline as consumers stayed home and some businesses closed. Business investment fell at a 2.8% pace and exports declined 7.6%, hurt by the strength of the dollar. Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of economic output, grew by 1.8% on an annual basis. In the fourth quarter \u2013 traditionally the best quarter for consumer spending \u2013 it grew 4.4%. The full report is here: And to make a trio of disappointing US numbers, consumer confidence fell to a six month low in May. The University of Michigan consumer sentiment index fell to 90.7 from a revised 95.9 in April, the biggest decline since the end of 2012. But it was an improvement on the preliminary May figure of 88.6 and economist expectations of a 89.9 reading. More downbeat numbers from the US. The Chicago Purchasing Managers Index came in at 46.2 in May, compared to 52.3 the previous month and forecasts of a figure of 53. This is the lowest level since February. Wall Street has opened lower after the revision of the US GDP figures to show a contraction in the first quarter. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is curently down around 50 points or 0.28%. But analysts are not getting too concerned about the US numbers. Dr Harm Bandholz at Unicredit said: Now we have it in writing: The US economy had another dismal start into the year, with real GDP shrinking an annualized 0.7%. This marks the third time in the past five years that first-quarter GDP growth in the US was negative. As there has been no other quarter with negative GDP growth during that time, the debate about potentially flawed seasonal adjustment procedures has been heated. The Federal Reserve, however, did not find any evidence of material residual seasonality, and blamed instead \u201cstatistical noise, unusually harsh weather, and other idiosyncratic factors\u201d for this recurring pattern. We agree and think that transitory factors, such as the inclement weather and the port strikes, played the major role. The fundamentals for a solid acceleration of the US economy all remain in place. This holds true in particular for consumer spending, the main growth engine. In addition to a continuation of solid payroll gains and an ongoing acceleration in wage increases, we expect the savings rate to reverse its latest increase. This gives another boost to consumer spending. Moreover, the Federal Reserve highlighted in its latest minutes that \u201cbusiness contacts in several parts of the country continued to be optimistic and expected sales, investment, and hiring to expand over the rest of the year.\u201d To be sure, while the anticipated rebound in the data is beginning to materialize right now, it started some weeks later than we originally thought. This may affect the quarterly growth pattern (with slightly weaker growth in the second quarter of 2015, and stronger gains in the second half of 2015). But overall, we remain confident that real GDP growth between the second quarter of 2015 and fourth quarter of 2015 will average 2\u00be% to 3%. Back with Greece, and could there really be hopeful signs that things could finally be resolved? Or is any optimism still on the Greek rather than the creditor side? And it\u2019s not just the US and Canada: Canada\u2019s economy also struggled in the last quarter. New data shows its GDP shrank by an annualised rate of 0.6% in January-March, the biggest contraction since 2009. The mining, quarrying, oil and gas extraction, construction, wholesale trade and manufacturing sectors all suffered a drop in output, according to Statistics Canada. US consumers still drove the economy forward, as this breakdown shows: Bad weather, less investment in oil exploration, and a port strike all drove the US economy into contraction, says Nancy Curtin, chief investment officer at Close Brothers Asset Management. She agrees that growth should now be picking up: \u201cConfidence has rebounded, the job market is buoyant and robust housing market data of late offers a much brighter outlook than the first quarter figures suggest. Equally, lower oil prices should contribute to an uplift in consumer spending, further boosting growth as the year progresses. Thanks to the fundamental strength of the economy, the Fed seems resolved to hike rates this year, although this will be patient and incremental, rather than drastic.\u201d The US economy is expected to bounce back in the current quarter, avoiding a recession. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, says recent data has been encouraging: \u201cThe decline has already been largely shrugged off as a temporary blip by policymakers, linked to extreme weather, port closures and what looks to be a regular pattern in the official data of the economy weakening at the start of the year. Survey evidence is already pointing to a second quarter pick-up. Markit\u2019s flash PMI data, for example, have signalled robust growth, especially in the service sector. The monthly data are running at levels broadly consistent with 2-3% annualised GDP growth in the second quarter. Job creation has also held up surprisingly well.\u201d Should we panic that economic activity across America fell last quarter? Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, says no. He blames some one-off factors for the poor performance, plus the wintery weather, and reckons the broader outlook is still bright \u201cFed Chair Janet Yellen will know that particularly poor winter weather, a strong dollar and an unstable energy sector weighed heavily on the data and all signs point to an immediate and strong turnaround. Once consumers start to spend the extra cash generated by cheaper gas prices as expected by many, Yellen and Co. will start to think seriously about raising interest rates. As I was saying... The US economy is suffering from the strength of the dollar. This new data shows that exports shrank by 7.6% during the quarter, while imports rose by 5.6%. The resulting trade gap is a drag on GDP. And corporate profits also took a hit -- down by 8.7% after tax. The fall in US GDP isn\u2019t quite as sharp as feared, but it still shows the world\u2019s largest economy hit a soft watch over the winter. BREAKING: The US economy contracted in the first three months of the year. Revised data shows that US GDP actually shrank by 0.7% on an annualised basis (or around -0.17% in true quarter-on-quarter terms). That\u2019s down from an initial estimate of 0.2% annualised growth (0.05% q/q), which was already quite meagre. Time for a very brief recap, before we get the US growth (or non-growth?) figures at 1.30pm BST. Greek bank deposit levels have fallen to their lowest level in over a decade, as fears intensify that it could face capital controls or a default without a deal with creditors soon. The country is also officially back in recession, after GDP shrank by 0.2% in the first three months of 2015. German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble has warned that the optimistic news from Greece does not match what he hears from its creditors. Speaking at the G7 meeting in Dresden, Sch\u00e4uble also said that Greece must get a deal by 30 June. US Treasury secretary Jack Lew has urged both sides to crack on and get a deal soon. Jean-Claude Juncker, EC president, is still confident of a deal \u201cin the days or weeks ahead\u201d. But Greece\u2019s deputy PM has criticised the lack of \u2018political will\u2019 to get a deal. And the uncertainty is weighing on Europe\u2019s stock markets, which are mainly in the red or flat today. Here\u2019s our latest news story, wrapping up all the main developments Greece needs to step up and produce a credible set of reforms, to pave the way to a deal, says Treasury secretary Lew. Jack Lew sounds exasperated with the lack of progress over Greece this year. Too much time has been wasted this year, the US treasury secretary tells reporters at the G7. Both sides need to get serious, fast. Jack Lew is also warning that the consequences of Greece leaving the eurozone can\u2019t be fully predicted. That\u2019s a message he also hammered home in London on Wednesday. US Treasury secretary Jack Lew is now giving a press conference in Dresden - and begins by subtly chiding Germany over its trade and budget surpluses. Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble is fielding more questions on Greece. He tells reporters at the G7 meeting in Dresden that although other European leaders may have \u201cdifferent views with the Greek leaders\u201d, we all share a common responsibility for Europe. We will do everything possible to live up to our responsibilities, he pledges. And he also points out that Greece\u2019s leaders have a democratic mandate. As Sch\u00e4uble puts it: The Greek government are the representatives of the Greek people, and that is why they deserve respect..... And he concludes by insisting that while it\u2019s not a marriage of love: I have no personal problem with my colleague [Greece\u2019s Yanis Varoufakis]. And that\u2019s the end of the press conference. Here\u2019s confirmation that EC president Jean-Claude Juncker has predicted a Greek deal soon... Onto questions... How much time is left to get a deal with Greece? Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble replies that we have until the end of June, when the existing programme runs out. As things stand, that programme will expire if there is no agreement. Weidmann says that the G7 policymakers see \u201cconsiderable merit\u201d in establishing a bankers code of conduct, to address the string of recent scandals. These scandals relate to the mindset in the financial industry, and the misconduct individuals. And individual integrity and good conduct is beyond the reach of regulation. The task of reshaping the global financial system after the crisis is not finished, says Weidmann. Policymakers at the G7 meeting agreed to press on and complete the job, including removing the problem of \u201cToo big to fail\u201d banks. Bundesbank president Jens Weidmann now gives a statement. We can\u2019t blame bad luck for the disappointing economic growth seen across the world economy in recent years, Weidmann says. He cites demographic factors, weakening productivity growth as factors that have hurt potential growth in recent years. (reminder, the press conference is live here) We had a brief discussion on Greece, Sch\u00e4uble says, only for a few minutes. And then he takes a pop at Athens, saying that the positive noises out of Greece do not match what the G7 was told by the institutions We stand ready to help Nepal after the tragic earthquake this month, which may include debt relief, says Sch\u00e4uble. We had a very intensive debate on terrorist financing, Sch\u00e4uble continues. He cites virtual currencies as an area of concern. On tax issues, we agreed that we must co-operate to boost tax fairness, and to improve cooperation between national tax bodies, Sch\u00e4uble tells the G7 press conference. It is feasible to make progress here, and to improve everyday tax administration. We need to work more with developing countries too. Sch\u00e4uble speaks first, saying the G7 meeting was \u201cmost successful\u201d. Of course, the ministers, central bank governors and economists didn\u2019t agree on everything....they never do. But we had a fruitful discussion on how to boost economic growth and make the global economy more resilient. There was full agreement on the need for structural reforms -- ambitious structural reforms to stimulate private sector investment and boost productivity. The G7 closing press conference with Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble and Jens Weidmann is starting now. This live feed has an English translation A flurry of quotes from EC president Jean-Claude Juncker just hit the wires; none of them suggest a breakthrough is imminent (he\u2019s in Toyko for a Japan-EU summit) The selloff in Europe\u2019s stock markets is accelerating, as investors fret about Greece. The German DAX is the worst performer, down over 1%. Daniel Sugarman of ETX Capital says traders are worrying about next month\u2019s IMF repayments (despite Yanis Varoufakis insisting he has it under control): European markets continued to feel the ongoing effects of the situation in Greece, with fresh fears that the country will be unable to make yet another repayment due to the IMF. The Greek government has still not made it clear how it intends to make the \u20ac1.6 billion repayment, the first tranche of which falls due next Friday. Heads-up: Germany\u2019s finance minister and central bank chief will be giving a press conference at the G7 meeting in Dresden, in around 40 minutes time. Greece\u2019s long slump is even worse than the Great Depression of the 1930s.... The Great Depression ended after president Roosevelt took a range of drastic measures, including suspending the gold standard in 1933. Greece, though, wasn\u2019t able to weaken its own currency so had to undergo such a painful \u2018internal devaluation\u2019. More gloom for Greece -- statistics body ELSAT has just confirmed that the country is back in recession. Updated GDP data showed that the Greek economy shrank by 0.2% in the first three months of 2015, in line with the initial estimate earlier this month. The detail of ELSTAT\u2019s report (online here) paints a pretty weak picture. Investment by companies and the government, or \u201cgross fixed capital formation\u201d tumbled by 7.5% compared with the 4th quarter of 2014. That suggests firms basically stopped spending amid the political uncertainty, as the government tightened its own belt too. Exports fell by 0.6% quarter-on-quarter, while imports decreased by 0.7%. Greece\u2019s economy had returned to growth last year, after plunging into a deep slump after accepting harsh austerity measures in return for two bailouts. But the \u201crecovery\u201d quickly stumbled. Greek GDP shrank by 0.4% in the final three months of last year; two consecutive quarters of contraction equals a recession. Last month\u2019s hefty withdrawals are part of a wider pattern. Greek banks have been suffering deposit outflows since December 2014, when the previous government called a general election after failing to elect a new president. This chart from Credit Suisse\u2019s Neville Hill shows how it slowed down after Greece won a four-month bailout extension in late February: Worried Greeks pulled \u20ac5.6bn out of their accounts last month, as the country\u2019s banks continue to bleed. Official data just released shows that Greek bank deposits fell to \u20ac139.4bn in April, down from \u20ac145bn in March. That\u2019s the lowest level since 2004, as fears of a default, capital controls or even a full-blown Grexit continue to alarm depositors. This could just send a shiver through the G7 meeting in Dresden and the negotiations in Brussels. Not to mention households across Greece. Bank deposits had been fairly stable last year, but have been steadily falling since the start of 2015, forcing the ECB to provide more and more help (\u20ac80.2bn of emergency liquidity at the last count) The picture is brighter in Italy this morning. The Italian stats office has just confirmed that the economy grew by 0.3% in the last quarter. That\u2019s in line with the initial estimate two weeks ago, and means Italy\u2019s economy expanded for the first time since autumn 2013. Yanis Varoufakis made some interesting points in his interview with Vima FM radio station, and a couple of perplexing ones. He said: Greece is aiming for a single, comprehensive agreement with the creditors that will involve debt relief. Greek negotiators are resisting pressure to accept \u201cpermanent recessionary measures\u201d, including raising VAT rates. Greece will not implement a transaction tax on bank withdraws, as has been rumoured (he claims the idea came from the creditors too) He also claimed that Greece could raise taxes without hurting economic demand, if they also promoted the redistribution of wealth in the economy..... And no-one should panic about Greece\u2019s ability to repay the International Monetary Fund next month. Yanis has it in hand. You can hear Yanis Varoufakis\u2019s radio interview here (it\u2019s in Greek.....) Thanks, Greek Analyst! Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis is speaking on Greek radio now. I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ve not got the link, but the key points are being tweeted: As if the Fifa scandal wasn\u2019t bad enough, Switzerland has been hit with the news that its economy is shrinking. Swiss GDP fell by 0.2% in the first three months of the year, worse than the stagnation which economists expected. The strong Swiss franc is being blamed. It soared in January after its central bank gave up trying to keep it artificially weak; that made Swiss exports less competitive. As the State Secretariat for Economic Affairs put it: \u201cThe trade balance in goods and services in particular delivered negative growth contributions.\u201d More news from the G7 meeting in Dresden, from French finance minister Michael Sapin. I think we knew that already..... Worries about Greece are weighing on Europe\u2019s stock markets again. They\u2019re mostly down in early trading: Stan Shamu of IG believes markets will remain edgy until a deal is reached: I suspect there will be plenty of headlines about Greece driving volatility in coming weeks as \u20ac1.6 billion is due over four tranches. What about Christine Lagarde\u2019s comment that Greece could leave the euro, Commissioner Moscovici? He replies that this is \u201cnot the scenario of the Commission\u201d. We are dedicated to have Greece staying in the eurozone, a solid Greece, a reformed Greece. And there is \u201ctrue solidarity\u201d between the Institutions (Greece\u2019s lenders) Moscovici tells CNBC\u2019s Steve Sedgwick. But being prepared and responsible, have you worked on a plan B for Grexit, in case a deal isn\u2019t reached? No, I don\u2019t consider that, Moscovici insists. We have one plan, one action, one will, to keep Greece in the eurozone. European commissioner Pierre Moscovici is the first policymaker to break cover from the G7 this morning. He told CNBC thatthere\u2019s been \u201cgood progress\u201d between Greece and lenders..... ....but more work needs to be done, including on Greece\u2019s pensions. Greece\u2019s deputy prime minister, Yannis Dragasakis, has claimed that \u2018political will\u2019 is the missing ingredient needed for a deal (explaining why his boss phoned the leaders of Germany and France last night) Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. We\u2019re coming to the end of another week that started with hopes of a breakthrough between Greece and its creditors, but has seen little evidence of progress since. Talks between the two sides will continue in Brussels today, and over the weekend, to close the gap on labour market reform, pensions, VAT rates and Greece\u2019s budget targets. The same issues they\u2019ve been split over for weeks. Greece hopes for a deal by Sunday, but its lenders remain quite sceptical. Last night\u2019s warning from Christine Lagarde that Greece could potentially leave the euro shows that policymakers still believe the crisis could spiral. As Lagarde argues, Grexit wouldn\u2019t be \u201ca walk in the park\u201d, but would \u201cprobably not\u201d mean the end of the euro. Greek PM Alexis Tsipras spoke with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Francois Hollande in a teleconference call last night, in an attempt to drum up a \u2018political\u2019 deal to break the deadlock. The Kathimerini newspaper explains: The three leaders spoke for about an hour and government sources referred to \u201ca positive climate.\u201d The exact content of the conversation remained unclear but it is thought Tsipras asked Merkel and Hollande to make good on a pledge they made at an EU leaders\u2019 summit in Riga last week to help overcome potential obstacles in the negotiations. As we covered yesterday, the Greek crisis was occupying the minds of the G7 finance ministers and central bankers yesterday. Not officially on the agenda, but \u2018on the sidelines. For example: Those G7 ministers will continue to discuss the global economy in Dresden today, so let\u2019s hope they didn\u2019t overdo the champagne. Also coming up today.... We get the second estimate of US growth in the first quarter of this year, at 1.30pm BST. The first estimate, of annualised growth of just 0.2%, could actually be revised even lower. We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day:",

Dr Harm Bandholz at Unicredit said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Now we have it in writing: The US economy had another dismal start into the year, with real GDP shrinking an annualized 0.7%. This marks the third time in the past five years that first-quarter GDP growth in the US was negative. As there has been no other quarter with negative GDP growth during that time, the debate about potentially flawed seasonal adjustment procedures has been heated. The Federal Reserve, however, did not find any evidence of material residual seasonality, and blamed instead \u201cstatistical noise, unusually harsh weather, and other idiosyncratic factors\u201d for this recurring pattern. We agree and think that transitory factors, such as the inclement weather and the port strikes, played the major role. </p> <p>The fundamentals for a solid acceleration of the US economy all remain in place. This holds true in particular for consumer spending, the main growth engine. In addition to a continuation of solid payroll gains and an ongoing acceleration in wage increases, we expect the savings rate to reverse its latest increase. This gives another boost to consumer spending. Moreover, the Federal Reserve highlighted in its latest minutes that \u201c<em>business contacts in several parts of the country continued to be optimistic and expected sales, investment, and hiring to expand over the rest of the year</em>.\u201d To be sure, while the anticipated rebound in the data is beginning to materialize right now, it started some weeks later than we originally thought. This may affect the quarterly growth pattern (with slightly weaker growth in the second quarter of 2015, and stronger gains in the second half of 2015). But overall, we remain confident that real GDP growth between the second quarter of 2015 and fourth quarter of 2015 will average 2\u00be% to 3%.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-55686af1e4b065daa5f9457f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-05-29T13:35:42.732Z\">2.35pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Back with Greece, and could there really be hopeful signs that things could finally be resolved?

      "bodyText": "Sell in May and go away? Leading shares fell back on Friday, the last trading day of May, after a late sell-off, but over the month they have just about proved that old City adage wrong. The FTSE 100 finished down 56.49 points on the day at 6984.43, but during May it edged up 23 points or 0.34%. Just about enough to keep investors in positive territory. Worries about Greece - a major factor on Friday as time runs out for a deal with its creditors and more of those involved openly talk about the prospect of the country leaving the eurozone - limited the monthly rise, as did uncertainty about when the US would raise interest rates. A poor set of economic data from the US, including a 0.7% contraction in first quarter GDP, only served to confuse the issue further. But the FTSE 250, which is less globally biased, reached new highs in May after the surprise victory by the Conservatives in the UK election, albeit losing 116.12 points on Friday as part of the general market decline to close at 18,120.88. Back with the FTSE 100, and Primark owner Associated British Foods was the day\u2019s best performer, adding 78p to \u00a330.28 as Goldman Sachs moved its recommendation from sell to buy, partly on the prospects for the discount fashion chain in the US. Weir rose 48p to \u00a320.24 after Credit Suisse raised its price target from \u00a319.15 to \u00a322.05. The bank said: We upgrade 2016 and 2017 earnings per share by 9% and 8% driven by an improving outlook for Weir oil and gas. 2015 now represents the trough for group earnings. Miners were mixed, with copper under pressure on reasonable inventories, but supported to some extent by hopes that China would introduce further stimulus measures to boost its economy. So Anglo American dipped 9p to \u00a310.26 after JP Morgan Cazenove cut its price target from 980p to 950p. But with gold and silver edging higher, Randgold Resources rose 53p to \u00a347.35 and Fresnillo was 19p better at 759.5p. Vodafone, which has been in demand after suggestions it could do a deal with John Malone\u2019s Liberty Global, added 1.65p to 255.35p after Jefferies raised its target price on the mobile operator from 226p to 230p with a hold recommendation. Weak UK consumer figures from Gfk hit retailers, with supermarket group Morrisons down 6p at 171p ahead of its annual meeting next week. Synergy Health dropped 72p to \u00a318.23 after the US Federal Trade Commission filed a lawsuit to block its proposed $1.9bn merger with Steris Corporation. Both companies said they were disappointed and would challenge the FTC\u2019s decision.

      "bodyText": "European shares fell on Friday after Greek bank deposits slumped to a decade low, raising fears that the country is heading towards a disorderly exit from the eurozone. Following a warning on Thursday from Christine Lagarde, head of the International Monetary Fund, that Greece could potentially leave the euro, investors remained sceptical of a debt deal this weekend. Athens\u2019s benchmark share index fell 1.4%, having been down almost 2%. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index was also down more than 1%. The deteriorating state of Greece\u2019s financial system was confirmed in new data showing that savers continue to pull their money out of the country\u2019s banks. Separate figures confirmed the economy shrank in the opening months of this year, leaving Greece back in recession. Against the backdrop of rising political uncertainty and fraught debt talks with Athens\u2019s international creditors, Greeks took \u20ac5.6bn (\u00a34bn) out of their accounts last month. The European Central Bank (ECB) confirmed further deposit losses for Greek banks, where customers have withdrawn money to keep it at home or move overseas. Deposits at Greek banks fell to \u20ac139.4bn in April from \u20ac145bn in March, to stand at their lowest level since 2009, ECB data showed. The latest depletion of funds continues a pattern which began in December, when the previous government called a general election after failing to elect a new president. The latest drop in deposits, a basic source of funding for banks, will intensify worries about the health of Greece\u2019s financial system. The depletion will also raise expectations that Greece could impose capital controls, whereby limits are placed on withdrawals from banks. The indebted country is scrambling to meet a 5 June deadline for a \u20ac305mpayment to the International Monetary Fund, just one of many creditor deadlines looming next month. Daniel Sugarman at ETX Capital commented: European markets continued to feel the ongoing effects of the situation in Greece, with fresh fears that the country will be unable to make yet another repayment due to the IMF. The Greek government has still not made it clear how it intends to make the \u20ac1.6bn repayment, the first tranche of which falls due next Friday. Greek ministers have admitted next week\u2019s \u20ac305m payment cannot be met without securing a deal to release the \u20ac7.2bn of loans outstanding on the country\u2019s current bailout programme. Separate figures on Friday underlined the blow dealt to the Greek economy by the uncertainty around the country\u2019s ability to meet its debt repayments and its position in the eurozone. GDP fell 0.2% in the first quarter after a 0.4% drop in the final months of 2014. The data from statistics body ELSTAT confirmed an earlier GDP estimate and showed a sharp drop in business investment and falling exports and imports. GDP shrinks again Talks between Greece and its creditors will continue over the weekend, to close the gap on labour market reform, pensions, VAT rates and Greece\u2019s budget targets. Greece\u2019s three creditors \u2013 the International Monetary Fund, the ECB and the European Union \u2013 are demanding reforms in exchange for releasing the \u20ac7.2bn in funds. Greece hopes for a deal by Sunday, but its lenders appear to remain sceptical. German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble on Friday poured cold water on Greek claims of a breakthrough in discussions. \u201cThe positive news from Athens is not fully reflected in the talks,\u201d Sch\u00e4uble told reporters after a G7 meeting of finance ministers and central bank chiefs in Dresden. The US treasury secretary, Jack Lew, used the meeting to renew his criticism of the slow progress so far on solving Greece\u2019s debt crisis. \u201cIf you look from January until now, too much time has been spent unproductively,\u201d he said. Lew also warned about the wider repercussions for the global economy. \u201cThere is great uncertainty in there at a time when the world needs greater stability and certainty,\u201d Lew told reporters after the G7 meetings. Lagarde said in an interview with German newspaper the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung on Thursday that a deal with Athens was unlikely to be reached over the next few days. She reportedly said: \u201cA Greek exit is a possibility.\u201d But the French finance minister, Michel Sapin, on Friday sought to play down such worries and stressed that officials were not considering the possibility of Greece leaving the eurozone. \u201cThere is no Grexit scenario,\u201d he told reporters at the G7 meetings.",

US gross domestic product (GDP) \u2013 the broadest measure of economic growth \u2013 shrank at an annualized rate of 0.7%. The Commerce Department had previously estimated output grew 0.2% from January through March. The quarterly economic decline is the first since the economy shrank by an even sharper 2.1% annual rate in the first quarter of 2014. A bleak winter also contributed to that decline as consumers stayed home and some businesses closed. Business investment fell at a 2.8% pace and exports declined 7.6%, hurt by the strength of the dollar. Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of economic output, grew by 1.8% on an annual basis. In the fourth quarter \u2013 traditionally the best quarter for consumer spending \u2013 it grew 4.4%. The dip was widely in line with economists predictions and is expected to be temporary. Economists are expecting GDP to grow at a roughly 2% pace in the current quarter. The GDP decline is unlikely to change thinking at the Federal Reserve, which is considering its first hike in interest rates since the 2008 economic crisis. The Fed chairwoman, Janet Yellen, has said she expects interest rates to rise this year. In a speech last week Yellen said that if the US economy continues to strengthen, \u201cit will be appropriate at some point this year to take the initial step to raise the federal funds rate\u201d. However, she cautioned the market not to expect any rapid increase in rates. \u201cAfter we begin raising the federal funds rate, I anticipate that the pace of normalization is likely to be gradual,\u201d she said in a speech in Rhode Island.",

    "webTitle": "Italian tax clampdown dims the sparkle at Bulgari", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "When Bulgari, the luxury Italian jeweller, set out to celebrate its 130-year anniversary last year at its flagship store on Rome\u2019s Via Condotti \u2013 where Richard Burton once bought Elizabeth Taylor a suite of diamond and emerald jewels \u2013 it spared no expense. It hired an architect to restore the marble interior and invited guests such as Carla Bruni and Adrien Brody, who attended the party alongside the billionaire Bulgari heirs, Paolo and Nicola. Months earlier, the grandsons of the Bulgari founder were caught up in a less glamorous occasion: the seizure of Bulgari\u2019s office on Via Condotti by Italy\u2019s tax police \u2013 the Guardia di Finanza \u2013 which confiscated the property in 2013 as part of a \u20ac46m (\u00a333m) asset seizure following allegations of tax evasion. This week, an Italian judge ordered Nicola and Paolo to stand trial on charges that they and 11 others evaded taxes from 2006 to 2010. Both deny the charges, according to a Bulgari spokesman. The case follows a spate of tax investigations into Italian luxury brands including Dolce &amp; Gabbana, Giorgio Armani, Prada, and the Marzotto textile firm. The authorities\u2019 track record is mixed. Last year, Italy\u2019s highest court overturned fraud convictions against the fashion duo Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana, , who had been facing 18-month jail terms for allegedly evading \u20ac1bn in taxes. Investigators scored a victory with fashion house Giorgio Armani, forcing the designer brand to pay \u20ac270m to Italian tax authorities to settle allegations that it used foreign subsidiaries to shield tax payments. Miuccia Prada of the Prada fashion house and her husband are reported to have paid \u20ac420m to settle their tax affairs in Italy after the company completed a voluntary disclosure in 2013. In the same year, the Marzotto family made a \u20ac56m tax payment in the wake of selling the Hugo Boss and Valentino labels. The inquiries reflect an attempt by authorities to crack down on alleged tax cheats as Italy tries to claw back some of the estimated \u20ac120bn lost every year through tax fraud. It is one way the country hopes to pare down Italy\u2019s \u20ac2tn debt load. It is no coincidence that many of the targets are among Italy\u2019s most successful companies and entrepreneurs, where the potential gains for the tax authorities are bigger. \u201cIf you go fishing in a small lake, you get small fish. If you go fishing in a big lake, you get big fish,\u201d said one person whose company has been targeted. However, tax experts say that in some cases officials are investigating companies that are trying legitimately tominimise their tax obligations, by setting up offices in low-tax jurisdictions such as Ireland. It is the same strategy used by many other multinational businesses \u2013 albeit controversially \u2013 such as Apple and Microsoft. \u201cI think all such cases with important names \u2013 like Bulgari or Prada \u2013 deal with tax avoidance rather than evasion, because these companies have implemented sophisticated strategies of locating assets offshore,\u201d says Tancredi Marino, a tax lawyer in Milan. \u201cIt is very important for the Italian tax police to have big names in the press that are under investigation because it puts pressure on an average Italian guy to \u2013 you know \u2013 report his half-a-million euros in Lugano [Switzerland],\u201d he adds. Some wealthy clients have been left scratching their heads about whether they ought to begin declaring income they have in overseas accounts, Marino says, because they are convinced the government will announce an amnesty programme \u2013 as it has done in the past \u2013 that might allow them to escape at least some fines. The tax police are also pursuing the financiers who allegedly help rich Italians funnel their money out of the country by disguising their assets in shell companies. Late last month, Italian police arrested a Swiss baron named Filippo Dollfus von Volckersberg, as he entered Italy to attend his grandchild\u2019s baptism. The Swiss financier is suspected of having \u201ccleaned\u201d at least \u20ac850m for Italian and international clients over the past 40 years,using shell companies to move and hide the funds, Italian prosecutors claim. Von Volckersberg\u2019s attorney did not respond to a request for comment. In the case of Bulgari, investigators have alleged that some of the company\u2019s executives evaded hundreds of millions of euros in taxes on about \u20ac3bn in revenue, generated in Rome, by moving its profits into low-tax subsidiaries such as Switzerland, Ireland, and the Netherlands. Police said in a statement at the time of the property seizure in 2013 that they had uncovered an \u201cescape strategy\u201d at Bulgari , which used an Irish subsidiary to sidestep the Italian tax system. The authorities allege the tax evasion occurred between 2006 and 2010, before Bulgari was taken over by LVMH, the French luxury group. But a Bulgari spokesman said that Italy\u2019s inland revenue office \u2013 which is separate and independent from the Guardia di Finanza \u2013 has already determined that most of the allegations against the group were essentially unfounded, because the foreign companies that were used for tax purposes were real businesses, and not merely \u201cshell\u201d companies. Bulgari said it agreed a \u20ac42m fine to settle the remaining allegation, which involved a dispute over corporate restructuring, rather than tax matters. The key issue in all the tax cases involving luxury firms, says Dario Stevanato, another tax expert, is whether companies are legitimately using companies they have created abroad, or whether the foreign entities are being used to hide funds from authorities. LVMH, which acquired Bulgari for \u20ac3.7bn, declined to comment on the case. A Bulgari spokesman said the financial structures that have been in place since before the acquisition \u2013 which are subject to the tax investigation \u2013 have not been changed since the takeover.",

      "bodyText": "Gina Rinehart\u2019s estranged son John Hancock has lashed out at the agriculture minister Barnaby Joyce for weighing in on a family dispute, saying the intervention was \u201cdangerous\u201d and that the minister had been \u201cmanipulated\u201d by the mining magnate. A bitter four-year dispute between Rinehart and her children was resolved on Thursday, after the New South Wales supreme court ruled the billionaire\u2019s oldest daughter Bianca take control of the family\u2019s $4bn trust fund. Rinehart, Australia\u2019s richest person, whose wealth is valued at $14bn, was due to relinquish control of the trust when her youngest child, Ginia, turned 25. Just days before her birthday, Rinehart secretly changed the terms of the trust to have control for another 50 years. Three of her four children had brought forward a case to gain access to the trust, but one daughter, Hope, pulled out after Rinehart gave her a loan worth $45m. Thursday\u2019s judgment noted that Gina Rinehart \u201chas repeatedly, directly, or through her lawyers, or through other influential connections, sought to deter the plaintiffs from prosecuting [the case], by measures some of which closely approach intimidation\u201d. \u201cThese commenced shortly after the proceedings were commenced, and continued at least until the eve of Bianca giving evidence at the second hearing,\u201d it continues. \u201cOn 11 September, Senator Barnaby Joyce sent Hope an email calculated to dissuade her from continuing the litigation. On 19 September, Mr Alby Schultz MP sent an email to Hope to similar effect.\u201d Joyce sent the email in 2011, before the Coalition was in power and before he was a minister. Hancock told ABC Radio on Friday that the intervention by the now agriculture minister is \u201cnothing short of dangerous\u201d. \u201cComing from his government email, I just think it\u2019s extraordinary. This character sits three chairs down from the prime minister,\u201d Hancock said. \u201cIt\u2019s been incredible the people that have come out and these senior politicians commenting on things that they either knew nothing about or have been manipulated to write to my younger sister.\u201d He told the Australian newspaper that \u201cBarnaby Joyce\u2019s involvement in this has been extraordinary pressure on us\u201d. \u201c[His involvement] is a dangerous example of a senior politician prepared to jump off a cliff without checking for rocks below. How he could endorse my mother\u2019s conduct by writing from his government email pushing my little sister to drop the case is outrageous.\u201d A spokesman for Joyce said the email was designed to encourage the family to resolve the dispute \u201cin-house and out of public view\u201d. \u201cIt would be a paradox now to comment publicly in the media about a family dispute which in his letter expressed then Senator Joyce\u2019s advice that there should be no public comment,\u201d the spokesman said. The opposition leader Bill Shorten said Joyce should have stayed out. \u201cBarnaby Joyce seems to have an opinion about everything but his day job. If it\u2019s not Johnny Depp\u2019s dogs, it\u2019s interfering in an acrimonious fight. I would say to Barnaby Joyce: please focus on your day job,\u201d Shorten told reporters on Friday. Joyce is a long-time friend of the billionaire businesswoman. In 2011, Rinehart flew Joyce and other Coalition MPs to India to attend a business acquaintance\u2019s wedding, and was in the chamber when Joyce gave his maiden speech in the House of Representatives in 2013. It is likely that Rinehart will appeal the court\u2019s decision, but family friend Alan Camp told ABC TV he is confident that the family can move past the dispute. \u201cThey are all robust individuals and once resolved, everything will be resolved,\u201d he said.",
