      "bodyText": "An investigation into supermarket own-brand pesto has found that bamboo fibres, potato flakes and nut flour are being used as cheaper alternatives to traditional ingredients. Pesto, which is traditionally made from basil, pine nuts, parmesan, olive oil \u2013 and sometimes lemon juice and garlic \u2013 has become a staple food in the UK. However, a Which? investigation into pesto sold by Asda, Co-op, M&amp;S, Morrisons, Sainsbury\u2019s, Tesco and Waitrose found that supermarket own-labels used cashew nuts instead of pine nuts, sunflower oil instead of olive oil and cheaper grana padano cheese instead of parmesan to cut costs. The analysis found the most authentic and traditional pestos on sale were the Asda Extra Special Genovese Basil Pesto, costing \u00a31.39, and the Waitrose 1 Pesto alla Genovese, priced at \u00a32.70. All standard supermarket pestos, with the exception of Waitrose, used thickeners such as potato flakes, bamboo fibres and nut flour; Sainsbury\u2019s, Tesco and Co-op recipes also contained sugar, while Tesco lists water as an ingredient of its standard pesto. Premium pesto recipes, advertised as \u201cpesto alla Genovese\u201d, must contain the traditional quartet of basil, olive oil, pine nuts and parmesan, but some supermarkets added extra ingredients: sugar, vegetable fibres and bamboo were all added to Morrisons, Sainsbury\u2019s and Tesco Pesto alla Genovese recipes. Nikki Stopford, director of research at Which?, said: \u201cPesto has become a staple food in the UK but our research shows that many shoppers may be getting more than they bargain for when it comes to the pesto they are buying \u2013 and not necessarily in a good way. \u201cOur advice is not to assume that all pesto contains the same traditional ingredients.

      "bodyText": "My father John Hood (also known as Jack), who has died aged 103, was a joiner and a lifelong socialist who, as Stoke-on-Trent\u2019s senior clerk of works, oversaw the construction of many of the city\u2019s public buildings. Among them were the police station, library, polytechnic and, in John\u2019s last job before retirement in 1979, the city\u2019s Potteries Museum and Art Gallery. He joined the Labour party as a young man, remaining a member all his life \u2013 except for a brief period when he left over the Iraq war \u2013 and served as both secretary and chair of the Newcastle-under-Lyme constituency. At the 2015 Labour party conference he received a lifetime merit award. Son of Florence (nee James) and Albert Hood, John was born and brought up in Burslem, one of the six Potteries towns that form Stoke-on-Trent. He left school at 14 to become an apprentice joiner, after pneumoconiosis forced his father, who worked in a potbank \u2013 a pottery factory \u2013 to give up his job. In the 1930s John was an active anti-fascist, disrupting meetings of Oswald Mosley\u2019s Blackshirts in the Potteries. In 1939, at the outbreak of the second world war, he volunteered for the army. Posted to Libya, he was involved in running supplies to the Free French army; he was then transferred to the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers in Cairo, where he took charge of a workshop. In 1944 he was part of a group who set up a forces parliament which, following a mock election, produced a Labour government committed to nationalisation of the banks and the building of 4 million homes. At the end of the war, John returned to the building trade with Stoke-on-Trent\u2019s public works department, rising to become a clerk of works and eventually senior clerk of works for the city. In 1980 he was a founder member of the Keele World Affairs group, which has grown into Europe\u2019s largest public forum on global issues. A popular member, known for asking difficult questions, he continued to attend into his 100th year. An enquiring, outgoing, caring man and engaging raconteur, John had many friends. At the end of 2017 he was proud to receive the French L\u00e9gion d\u2019Honneur in recognition of his wartime service. On returning from war John had married his fiancee, Elsie; sadly, she had contracted TB and died two years later. In 1949 he married Sheila Roy, my mother. She died in 1974. Three years later John married Enid Ward, with whom he shared many happy, adventurous years until her death in 1995. This marriage also brought a large stepfamily, with whom John had a loving relationship. He is survived by me.",

    "webTitle": "Goldman Sachs banker appointed London Stock Exchange CEO", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The London Stock Exchange has ended its six-month search for a new chief executive by appointing Goldman Sachs banker David Schwimmer to replace Xavier Rolet, who was pushed out in November. Schwimmer, who advises exchanges as the head of Goldman\u2019s market structure business in New York, will join in August after 20 years at the Wall Street firm. He will be paid \u00a3775,000 a year plus a bonus of up to \u00a31.7m and will receive \u00a31.05m to make up for not getting his 2018 bonus from the US investment bank. The 49-year-old American\u2019s first task will be to steady LSE after an unusually turbulent period for one of the City\u2019s oldest and most prestigious institutions. After Rolet\u2019s departure was announced in October, TCI Fund Management, one of LSE\u2019s biggest shareholders, called for his reinstatement and accused the board of forcing him out against the interests of investors. The dispute came to a head in late November when Rolet agreed to leave immediately and LSE said its chairman, Donald Brydon, would not stand for re-election after 2019. Schwimmer\u2019s appointment resolves LSE\u2019s quest for a new chief executive less than two weeks before its annual general meeting on 24 April. With a new chief executive lined up, Brydon is likely to face an easier ride at the meeting. TCI declined to comment on the decision to hire Schwimmer. The Yale and Harvard graduate will also have to defend LSE\u2019s position as the world\u2019s biggest clearing house for derivative transactions against competition from European exchanges. Germany\u2019s Deutsche B\u00f6rse is trying to lure the lucrative business away from London after the Brexit vote. London Clearing House, which LSE controls, processes about three-quarters of the \u20ac1tn-a-day (\u00a3865bn) clearing market for derivatives, acting as a middleman between buyers and sellers of complex contracts. Rolet warned in 2016 that thousands of City jobs were at risk if London lost responsibility for clearing contracts in euros after Brexit though he said there were very few exchanges that could handle the business. Schwimmer, who is based in New York, spent his first seven years at Goldman advising exchanges and stockbrokers. He then worked as chief of staff to Goldman\u2019s chief executive, Lloyd Blankfein, when Blankfein was the bank\u2019s chief operating officer. From 2006 to 2009 he jointly ran Goldman\u2019s business in Russia before becoming head of metals and mining. Last year he combined that job with heading Goldman\u2019s market structure business in a return to advising exchanges. Brydon said: \u201cDavid is a leader with great experience in the financial market infrastructure sector, which he has been closely involved in throughout his investment banking career, as well as capital markets experience in both developed and emerging markets. He is well known for his robust intellect and partnership approach with clients and colleagues alike.\u201d Schwimmer will be the second former Goldman banker to lead the LSE. Rolet spent 10 years at the bank before leaving in 1994. Mark Carney, the Bank of England\u2019s governor, also worked at Goldman. Carney was drawn into LSE\u2019s dispute with TCI when he said he was \u201cmystified\u201d by events at the exchange. Schwimmer will take over from David Warren, who has run LSE as interim chief executive since Rolet\u2019s departure. Warren will return to his job as LSE\u2019s chief financial officer. Michael Werner, an analyst at UBS, the Swiss bank, said Schwimmer\u2019s appointment was good news for LSE because it clears up the leadership question and investors were hoping an outsider would take over. As a former merger and acquisitions banker, Schwimmer will be equipped to buy other companies, in line with its current strategy, he said. On top of his salary and bonus, Schwimmer will get a cash allowance of 15% of his salary in lieu of pension and other benefits. He will be awarded shares worth three times his salary that will bear fruit if he achieves targets. He will also receive an undisclosed sum for moving from New York and a housing allowance.",

      "bodyText": "Camera specialist retailer Jessops is targeting the selfie-generation with new-style stores that promote instant photo gifts. Five years after being rescued from administration by Dragon\u2019s Den panellist Peter Jones, Jessops now has 58 outlets including 11 in Sainsbury\u2019s stores. Sales rose 24% to nearly \u00a3100m in the year to April 2017. While the company slipped to a pretax loss of \u00a3764,875, this was largely because of the setup of a new venture to run a chain of stores for Samsung. Jessops expect to return to profit this year. Sales of more expensive high-spec cameras are rising by a few percent a year, but the market for photo-print gifts, such as posters, printed canvases or coasters, is growing much faster \u2013 forecast to be nearly 40% between now and 2020. In a bid to grab a greater share of that market, a handful of Jessops stores have introduced specialist printing machines and trained staff who can produce in less than an hour canvas prints, posters and \u201cshuffle\u201d photos which combine multiple pictures on one print so that they can be slipped straight into a montage frame. Speaking at a new-style store in Bromley, Neil Old, chief executive of Jessops, said he expected to have converted 12 shops by mid-summer and potentially half the chain in the next 12 months. He still wants to serve keen hobbyists who are looking for zoom lenses and other kit, but is broadening Jessops\u2019s appeal to enable more casual photographers to put their work on display. \u201cOver the last 10 years everyone has been taking pictures on their smartphones and it\u2019s becoming increasingly clear customers want to do something with those photos.\u201d The trend echoes the renaissance of other traditional media, such as vinyl records and physical books, in recent years. \u201cPeople do want physical evidence of what they have bought or done,\u201d said Old. While the likes of Photobox, Notonthehighstreet and Snappy Snaps all offer personalised photo gifts, none of them do so in such a short timeframe. Only the latter has a widespread high-street presence while Boots shut 220 of its 320 photo processing labs last year, creating more space in the market. Old said: \u201cFor any retailer to succeed on the high street you need to have an experience, good staff and something you are never going to get on the internet.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The luxury brand Burberry has appointed the former boss of B&amp;Q owner Kingfisher as its new chairman. Gerry Murphy, who currently chairs the food group Tate &amp; Lyle and the European arm of the private equity firm Blackstone, will succeed Sir John Peace, who has been in the role since Burberry was spun out of the catalogue company GUS in 2002. Peace said Burberry had found a \u201csuperb\u201d candidate with extensive knowledge of the consumer sector. Murphy has had stints at the food group Greencore and the media group Carlton, and filled non-executive director roles at Alton Towers owner Merlin Entertainments and Reckitt Benckiser. \u201cI am confident he is the right choice to lead the board as Burberry embarks on a new chapter,\u201d Peace said. Murphy will take over at Burberry on 17 May, the day before the company is due to announce its full-year financial results. His appointment completes the overhaul of Burberry\u2019s leadership team triggered by the exit of the former chief executive Angela Ahrendts five years ago. Christopher Bailey, the group\u2019s long-term design director, initially took over her role alongside his creative duties. But after shareholder concern about flagging sales, the former C\u00e9line boss Marco Gobbetti became chief executive last year. A new finance director, Julie Brown, came to Burberry from the medical supplies firm Smith &amp; Nephew in early 2017. Bailey initially stayed on as chief creative officer and president, but announced plans to leave the company in October. In a surprise move, the former Givenchy designer Riccardo Tisci, known for his sexy, urban styles, took over creative duties last month. Burberry said his \u201cskill in blending streetwear with high fashion is highly relevant to today\u2019s luxury consumer\u201d. Gobbetti, who previously worked with Tisci and Givenchy, has also raised eyebrows with a pledge to put Burberry more firmly at the luxury end of the retail market, pulling out of some department stores. Murphy said: \u201cBurberry is a unique British brand that I have admired for a long time, and I am looking forward to working with Marco Gobbetti and the board to guide the company through its next phase of growth.\u201d Steve Clayton, manager of a Hargreaves Lansdown fund that holds a stake in Burberry, welcomed Murphy\u2019s appointment. \u201cI\u2019m not expecting the introduction of Burberry-check power drills,\u201d Clayton said. \u201cMurphy has had a varied management career over the years, including his current day job at Blackstone. Given that everyone is currently linking Burberry to one deal or another, it doesn\u2019t seem a bad idea to have a chairman that can spot a good deal from a bad one.\u201d It not clear whether the departure of 69-year-old Peace from Burberry will mark the end of his long career in the boardrooms of some of the UK\u2019s biggest companies. At one point, Peace chaired three FTSE 100 businesses: Burberry, the credit-checking company Experian and the Standard Chartered bank. At Burberry, he was forced to defend the decision to give Bailey the roles of chief creative designer and chief executive after Ahrendts quit to run Apple\u2019s retail operations. He also came under fire over pay arrangements, with 52.7% of investors rebelling against Bailey\u2019s pay deal at Burberry\u2019s 2014 annual shareholder meeting.",

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s brilliant to read about the fantastic impact that social enterprises are having on Plymouth (Aditya Chakrabortty: A city that grows good companies, 11 April), allowing the city to grow and develop on its own terms. What is happening in Plymouth is inspiring, but it is important to note that, far from being contained to one city, social enterprises are part of a global movement. In the UK alone, there are tens of thousands of social enterprises \u2013 each one dedicated to putting people and communities ahead of private profit. Plymouth is one of 25 officially accredited Social Enterprise Places using social enterprise as a tool to create fairer, accountable and more sustainable economies. Far from being a new idea, social enterprises have proud origins. The Rochdale Pioneers used the principles of social enterprise to tackle the inequities of the Industrial Revolution and these same principles of fairness, equality and community benefit inform social enterprises today. If we are to truly create an alternative to our failed economic model, we need to embrace the potential of social enterprise. It represents and must become the future of business and of our economy. Peter Holbrook Chief executive, Social Enterprise UK \u2022 Larry Elliott (People want basic things, and a politics to provide them, 12 April) rightly comments that in the new post-cold-war politics, parties that once believed their job was to make capitalism work for voters now believed their task was to make voters fit for capitalism. However, the convoluted thinking of the capitalists now in power is achieving the exact opposite. Their euphemism for \u201cfit for capitalism\u201d is \u201cfit for work\u201d. A two-child limit is put on the payment of unemployment benefits. The exclusions are listed as those born as a result of multiple birth, adopted children in parental caring arrangements and those born as a result of non-consensual sex. They forget that all children are equally valuable and leave the remaining children, above two per impoverished family, at risk of debilitating lifetime poverty. It ought not be too difficult for a government to work out that if you cut housing benefit while rents go up and freeze the increases of other benefit incomes needed for food, fuel and other necessities, or even stop them while prices rise, then more and more families will not be able to pay the rent, eat food or keep warm; therefore more and more will be homeless, fall ill and die young. The prevention of ill health is worth every penny of our money that a government spends on an adequate and fair benefit system. Of course unemployed people should look for work but a policy of enforced deprivation means our valuable fellow citizens are not fit for work and the British economy is unfit for the world. Rev Paul Nicolson Taxpayers Against Poverty \u2022 Larry Elliott has revisited what George Orwell wrote 70 years ago. But could I suggest that the Guardian stops using the term socialism (For the many \u2013 what Bernie taught Jeremy, G2, 12 April). This term is now used pejoratively by the right to try to discredit anything to the left of Thatcherism. It\u2019s social democracy and it was largely successful in redistributing wealth in this country in the three decades after the war and is still successful elsewhere, notably in the Scandinavian countries. Milton Friedman and his friends launched just as fierce attacks on social democracy as on outright communism because they knew that communism was already seen to be failing whereas social democracy was demonstrably working. How sad that it\u2019s taken nearly four decades for the British people to wake up to the failures of Friedmanism. That was another facet of our national character that Orwell commented on. David Redshaw Gravesend, Kent \u2022 Political discussion in the UK should henceforward stick to the propositions advanced by Larry Elliott. \u201cLiberalising markets did not lead to economic nirvana; instead the orgy of speculation led to the financial crisis of 2008 \u2026 The record shows that the managed capitalism of the cold war delivered better results than the unmanaged capitalism since.\u201d So Managed capitalism should therefore include a land value tax to control property price inflation which got out of control in the liberalised markets immediately prior to 2008, although LVT was the stabilising element in the laissez-faire system proposed by Adam Smith in The Wealth of Nations in 1776. People will eventually rumble that increasing the money supply only makes matters worse if it just inflates land values and, by taking undue rents and mortgage payments, diminishes demand for goods and services that people produce.

      "body": "<p>It\u2019s brilliant to read about the fantastic impact that social enterprises are having on Plymouth (Aditya Chakrabortty: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/11/post-industrial-plymouth-business-social-enterprise\" title=\"\">A city that grows good companies</a>, 11 April), allowing the city to grow and develop on its own terms. What is happening in Plymouth is inspiring, but it is important to note that, far from being contained to one city, social enterprises are part of a global movement. In the UK alone, there are tens of thousands of social enterprises \u2013 each one dedicated to putting people and communities ahead of private profit. Plymouth is one of 25 officially accredited <a href=\"https://www.socialenterprise.org.uk/Pages/Category/social-enterprise-places\" title=\"\">Social Enterprise Places</a> using social enterprise as a tool to create fairer, accountable and more sustainable economies.</p> <p>Far from being a new idea, social&#xa0;enterprises have proud origins. The Rochdale Pioneers used the principles of social enterprise to tackle the inequities of the Industrial Revolution and these same principles of fairness, equality and&#xa0;community benefit inform social&#xa0;enterprises today.</p> <p>If&#xa0;we&#xa0;are&#xa0;to truly create an alternative to our failed economic model, we need to embrace the potential of social enterprise. It represents and must become the future of business and of our economy.<br><strong>Peter Holbrook</strong><br><em>Chief executive, Social Enterprise UK</em></p> <p>\u2022 Larry Elliott (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/12/homes-jobs-future-global-capitalism-mainstream-political-parties\" title=\"\">People want basic things, and a politics to provide them</a>, 12 April) rightly comments that in the new post-cold-war politics, parties that once believed their job was to make capitalism work for voters now believed their task was to make voters fit for capitalism. However, the convoluted thinking of the capitalists now in power is achieving the exact opposite. Their&#xa0;euphemism for \u201cfit for&#xa0;capitalism\u201d is \u201cfit for work\u201d.</p> <p>A two-child limit is put on the payment of unemployment benefits. The exclusions are listed as those born as a result of multiple birth, adopted children in parental caring arrangements and those born as a result of non-consensual sex. They forget that all children are equally valuable and leave the remaining children, above two per impoverished family, at risk of debilitating lifetime poverty.</p> <p>It ought not be too difficult for a government to work out that if you cut housing benefit while rents go up and freeze the increases of other benefit incomes needed for food, fuel and other necessities, or even stop them while prices rise, then more and more families will not be able to pay the rent, eat food or keep warm; therefore more and more will be homeless, fall ill and die young. The prevention of ill health is worth every penny of our money that a government spends on an adequate and fair benefit system. Of&#xa0;course unemployed people should look for work but a policy of enforced deprivation means our valuable fellow citizens are not fit for work and the British economy is unfit for the world. <br><strong>Rev Paul Nicolson</strong><br><em>Taxpayers Against Poverty</em></p> <p>\u2022 Larry Elliott has revisited what George Orwell wrote 70 years ago. But&#xa0;could I suggest that the Guardian stops using the term socialism (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/apr/11/bernie-sanders-jeremy-corbyn-labour-for-the-many\" title=\"\">For the many \u2013 what Bernie taught Jeremy</a>, G2, 12 April). This term is now used pejoratively by the right to try to discredit anything to the left of Thatcherism. It\u2019s social democracy and it was largely successful in redistributing wealth in this country in the three decades after the war and is still successful elsewhere, notably in the Scandinavian countries. Milton Friedman and his friends launched just as fierce attacks on social democracy as on outright communism because they knew that communism was already seen to be failing whereas social democracy was demonstrably working. How sad that it\u2019s taken nearly four decades for the British people to wake up to the failures of Friedmanism. That was another facet of our national character that Orwell commented on.<br><strong>David Redshaw</strong><br><em>Gravesend, Kent</em></p> <p>\u2022 Political discussion in the UK should henceforward stick to the propositions advanced by Larry Elliott. \u201cLiberalising markets did not lead to economic nirvana; instead the orgy of speculation led to the financial crisis of 2008 \u2026 The record shows that the managed capitalism of the cold war delivered better results than the unmanaged capitalism since.\u201d</p> <p>So Managed capitalism should therefore include a land value tax to control property price inflation which got out of control in the liberalised markets immediately prior to 2008, although LVT was the stabilising element in the laissez-faire system proposed by Adam Smith in The Wealth of Nations in 1776. People will eventually rumble that increasing the money supply only makes matters worse if it just inflates land values and, by taking undue rents and mortgage payments, diminishes demand for goods and services that people produce.<br><strong>DBC Reed</strong><br><em>Northampton </em></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email </em></strong><a href=\"mailto:guardian.letters@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><strong><em>guardian.letters@theguardian.com</em></strong></a></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Read more Guardian letters \u2013 click here to visit </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tone/letters\" title=\"\"><strong><em>gu.com/letters</em></strong></a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Rolls-Royce has said extra checks on one of its plane engines will add unexpected costs and cause further disruption for airlines including British Airways, Virgin and Norwegian. In an embarrassment for one of the UK\u2019s top engineering groups, the company said more inspections would be needed to tackle problems with its Trent 1000 engines, which are used in Boeing\u2019s Dreamliner 787. The issue concerns parts in 380 engines that are wearing out sooner than planned and affects up to 170 planes in use by airlines. The Dreamliners will need to be grounded for checks and replacements. Rolls-Royce said last month it was facing a \u00a3370m bill because of the engines, but it indicated on Friday that that figure would rise with the cost of replacing more parts and paying airlines compensation. \u201cWhile the compressor technical issue was known at the time of our results, the requirement for more regular inspections will lead to higher than previously guided cash costs being incurred during 2018,\u201d it said in a statement. Rolls-Royce claimed that its cash flow for 2018 would be unaffected, at around \u00a3450m, because it would cut non-essential spending on travel, IT upgrades and other costs to offset the impact of the work. The company did not put a figure on the extra cost of the inspections. Warren East, the chief executive, said: \u201cWe sincerely regret the disruption this will cause to our customers, and our team of technical experts and service engineers is working around the clock to ensure we return them to full service as soon as possible.\u201d European and US aviation regulators issued guidance about the problem to airlines on Friday. The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) plans to reduce the amount of time affected planes can fly on a single engine after a failure of the other. The time limit would drop as low as 140 minutes, compared with the current window of 330 minutes, a source familiar with the plans said. This would effectively curtail operations across oceans or remote areas. Virgin Atlantic said it had up to four 787s grounded at any one time while it organised replacement engines from Rolls-Royce. Virgin has also leased three Airbus A330-200s to help cover its flying programme. A Virgin spokeswoman said it had been aware of the increased inspections and that the cover it had in place would be sufficient. Boeing said about 25% of the 787 Dreamliners flying were powered by the engine and it was deploying support teams to mitigate service disruptions. Rolls-Royce\u2019s share price closed down 1.6% at \u00a38.67.",

      "bodyText": "We are closing the blog and will be back on Monday. Have a good weekend! Jaguar Land Rover, Britain\u2019s biggest carmaker, is to cut 1,000 contractor jobs in Solihull in the Midlands, after a fall in sales it attributed to uncertainty caused by the Brexit vote and the government\u2019s diesel policy. Here is our story: Europe\u2019s major stock markets are all up as tensions between the US and Russia over Syria appear to have eased. UK\u2019s FTSE 100 up 0.18% Germany\u2019s Dax up 0.77% France\u2019s CAC up 0.45% Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB up 0.5% Spain\u2019s Ibex up 0.92% However, Wall Street has opened slightly lower, despite strong first-quarter earnings from JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Wells Fargo. The latter faces a $1bn payment to settle regulatory investigations. Oil prices have edged higher and are on track for their biggest weekly gain since July. Brent crude in London is 0.3% higher at $72.22 a barrel while US crude is 0.2% ahead at $67.21 a barrel. Both have risen about $5 this week, in gains of about 8%. The pound is still trading 0.2% higher against the dollar at $1.460. Here is the statement from Jaguar: As is standard business practice, Jaguar Land Rover regularly reviews its production schedules to ensure market demand is balanced globally. On Monday we will be cascading our 18/19 production plans for the next fiscal year to our workforce. In light of the continuing headwinds impacting the car industry, we are making some adjustments to our production schedules and the level of agency staff. We are however continuing to recruit large numbers of highly skilled engineers, graduates and apprentices as we are over-proportionally invest in new products and technologies. We also remain committed to our UK plants in which we have invested more than \u00a34bn since 2010 to future proof manufacturing technologies to deliver new models. We are not renewing TEMPORARY contracts of a number of agency staff at Solihull. Jaguar Land Rover has confirmed that it will cut 1,000 contractor jobs at its Solihull factory. Britain\u2019s biggest carmaker blamed a fall in sales due uncertainty caused by the Brexit vote along with confusion over the government\u2019s diesel policy. Back to Jaguar Land Rover. ITV is reporting that Britain\u2019s biggest carmaker will announce production cuts and 1,000 job losses on Monday, and blame Brexit. The company has told Reuters that it is making some adjustments to its production schedules and the level of agency staff. It added that it would unveil its 2018-19 production plans to its workforce on Monday. Jaguar also said that it regularly reviews its production schedules. Wells Fargo faces a $1bn fine to settle outstanding regulatory investigations related to car insurance and mortgage lending abuses, the bank said. This means it may have to revise its quarterly results to reflect the final settlement. Over in the US, Citigroup has reported a 13% increase in quarterly profits, fuelled by lower taxes and higher revenues from consumer banking. The fourth-biggest American bank by assets said net income rose to $4.6bn in the first quarter to 31 March, compared with $4.1bn a year earlier. Earnings per share climbed to $1.68 from $1.35. Analysts had expected $1.61. Wells Fargo, another US bank, posted a 6% rise in first-quarter profits to $5.5bn. Earlier today, America\u2019s biggest bank JPMorgan reported a 35% jump in profits. US companies have benefited from the Trump administration\u2019s corporate tax cuts. In January, Jaguar said it would temporarily scale back production at its factory in Halewood near Liverpool in the second quarter. The factory builds three Range Rover models and employs around 6,000 people. Britain\u2019s biggest car manufacturer blamed faltering sales after the Brexit vote and a tax crackdown on diesel vehicles. Here\u2019s our story at the time Breaking news: Joel Hills at ITV is tweeting that Jaguar Land Rover will cut production and around 1,000 jobs after a slump in sales. The company is expected to blame Brexit and the slump in demand for diesel vehicles. Meanwhile, in Italy, the eurozone\u2019s third-largest economy, talks to form a government are still deadlocked. President Sergio Mattarella has declared that there has been \u201cno progress\u201d after a second round of talks with political parties. JPMorgan Chase, the biggest US bank by assets, has kicked off the US bank reporting season with strong figures. It has posted a 35% jump in first-quarter profits, boosted by higher interest rates on loans and lower taxes. The bank\u2019s net income rose to $8.7bn or $2.37 a share, in the three months to March from $6.5bn, or $1.65 a share, a year earlier. Analysts had pencilled in $2.28 a share. Further detail on the comments made by Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov at a press conference this morning, courtesy of Reuters. He said he hoped there would be no repeat of the experience of Libya and Iraq in the Syria conflict, in a veiled warning to US president Donald Trump. God forbid anything adventurous will be done in Syria following the Libyan and Iraqi experience. He said even the smallest miscalculation in Syria could lead to new waves of migrants and that ultimatums and threats do not help the dialogue. More reassuringly, he said Russia and the US are using their channels of communications on Syria. European stock markets have taken the comments in their stride and are still trading higher, with the exception of the FTSE 100 in London, which remains flat partly due to the strengthening pound. Germany\u2019s Dax is up 0.67% while France\u2019s CAC is 0.3% higher. On a lighter note, the appointment of Goldman Sachs banker David Schwimmer as the new chief executive of the London Stock Exchange has prompted a lot of Friends jokes. There are some snaps on Reuters quoting the Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov as saying that the atmosphere around Syria is very alarming, and that ultimatums and threats do not help the dialogue. He also said that the channels of communication with the US are being used. Gold prices are up for a second week as concerns over the conflict in Syria remain. While Donald Trump has back-pedalled on the threat of US missile strikes in Syria following last weekend\u2019s chemical attack on civilians, the situation with Syria\u2019s main ally Russia remains tense. Russia\u2019s deputy prime minister Arkady Dvorkovich said international relations should not depend on the mood of one person when he wakes up in the morning. More on our politics blog. Gold is seen as a safe haven investment. Spot gold is trading 0.4% higher at $1,340.79 an ounce. And here are Mahony\u2019s thoughts on China moving to trade deficit in March for the first time in a year. Chinese trade data has been the big focus for markets after the biggest economy in Asia posted its first dollar-denominated trade deficit in a year. A sizeable downward shift in Chinese exports will certainly provide heightened anxiety over where we go from here, with the threat of a trade war looming large over an economy which is still heavily reliant upon international demand for their products. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at at online trading firm IG, has taken a closer look at the UK stock market and the pound. Sterling has hit 10-week highs against the dollar and 11-week highs against the euro, partly related to diverging interest rate expectations for the UK and the eurozone. The Bank of England is widely expected to raise interest rates next month. The FTSE has continued to underperform its peers this morning, with the index trading in the red despite gains across German, Spanish and French indices. Dovish minutes from the European Central Bank yesterday, coupled with a wider story of dollar weakness has ensured the pound continues to outperform against its main peers. With the pound hitting a two-month high against the dollar and ten-month high against the euro, it comes as no surprise that the internationally focused FTSE 100 suffers, while the domestically focused FTSE 250 joins its European counterparts in the green. In other data just out, the eurozone\u2019s trade surplus increased to \u20ac21bn in February from \u20ac20.2bn in January. Exports in the 19 countries sharing the euro declined by 2.3% but imports fell more, by 3.1%, month on month, according to the European Union\u2019s statistics office Eurostat. The euro is broadly unchanged versus the dollar after final German inflation figures met economists\u2019 expectations. In March, German inflation rose to a 1.6% annual rate from 1.4%. Spanish inflation also increased, to a four-month high of 1.2%, as did French CPI, which was released yesterday. It was confirmed at a 5 1/2 year high of 1.7% in March. Madden says: The rise in the cost of living in major eurozone countries points to an increase in demand, which is good for economic growth. David Maddden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, says: Stocks are mixed this morning with traders cautious about being overly long going into the weekend. President Trump\u2019s rhetoric in relation to Syria has dialled down and this has removed some of the fear in the market, but as the situation is yet to be resolved, investors aren\u2019t particularly optimistic. We are expecting the Dow Jones to open up 22 points at 24,505 and we are calling the S&amp;P 500 flat at 2664. Oil prices are now heading higher again and are on course for their biggest weekly gain since July. Brent crude in London is up 0.7% at $72.53 a barrel, taking its gain this week to around 8%. US crude is also trading 0.7% higher, at $67.53 a barrel, and is up nearly 9% this week. European stock markets are rising, with the exception of the FTSE 100 in London, which is flat at 7,252. Germany\u2019s Dax up 0.4% France\u2019s CAC up 0.2% Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB up 0.15% Spain\u2019s Ibex up 0.37% On currency markets, sterling has extended gains, rising nearly 0.5% above $1.4292 to 10-week highs. The dollar, for its part, has touched a six-week high against the yen as fears over an imminent US strike in Syria faded and investors anticipated strong US corporate earnings. Banks JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Wells Fargo will report first-quarter results before Wall Street opens today. The dollar rose 0.3% to 107.620 yen, its highest level since late February. Paul Donovan, global chief economist at UBS Wealth Management, has sent us his thoughts on trade. US president Trump suggested that there may not, in fact, be any new tariffs imposed in the Sino-US trade dispute, and that the US might apply to join the TPP. Markets have given cautious welcome to this news. Welcome, because avoiding a trade war is a clear economic positive. Cautious, because market trust in US presidential announcements is, perhaps, a little limited. Re-joining the TPP could be construed as anti-Chinese. The TPP is a preferential trade deal, meaning that those outside the deal are at a competitive disadvantage to those inside the deal. On the Sino-US trade dispute, the US does seem to be pushing hard for a tweetable \u201cwe won\u201d moment. The substance of any deal seems less important. Donovan noted that China\u2019s trade surplus turned into a deficit in March but said this is \u201cseasonal and temporary\u201d. The eurozone will be publishing its trade figures for February soon. The London Stock Exchange has picked Goldman Sachs banker David Schwimmer as its new chief executive, succeeding Xavier Rolet, who was forced out in November. The 49-year-old American is due to start at the LSE on 1 August after a 20-year career with the US investment bank, most recently as global head of market structure and global head of metals and mining in the investment banking division. He has also served as chief of staff to Goldman CEO Lloyd Blankfein, then chief operating officer. Schwimmer will be paid an annual salary of \u00a3775,000 plus a potential bonus of 225% of salary, pro-rated for 2018 as he joins half way through the year. The size of bonus depends on the company\u2019s financial performance. He will also bank a one-off payment of \u00a31.05m to compensate for the \u201cforfeiture of cash compensation for 2018 from his previous employer\u201d \u2013 dubbed a \u201cgolden hello\u201d. Schwimmer is also entitled to a 2018 long-term incentive plan grant of 300% of salary, which will vest based on performance over a three-year period. In addition, he will get a cash allowance of 15% of salary instead of pension and standard UK benefits, as well relocation support including housing allowance. Frenchman Xavier Rolet stood down as LSE boss in November 2017 after reported boardroom clashes over his management style. LSE chairman Donald Brydon said about Schwimmer: He is well known for his robust intellect and partnership approach with clients and colleagues alike. David Warren, who has been the LSE\u2019s interim chief executive, will stay on as finance chief. Rolet was chief executive for more than eight years, when the LSE\u2019s stock market value soared from \u00a3800bn to almost \u00a315bn. However, the company suffered a severe setback when the planned \u00a321bn merger with Germany\u2019s Deutsche B\u00f6rse was blocked by the European Commission in March 2017. It was the third botched attempt at a tie-up between the two stock exchange operators. Trading is lacklustre this morning on European stock markets, but they are near one-month highs. The Stoxx 600 index is on track for its third consecutive week of gains, its longest winning streak since January. Most of the first-quarter results released by European companies were positive. However British software firm Sage saw its shares plunge 19% after it cut its full-year revenue outlook. It is leading losses on the FTSE 100 index in London. British aircraft engine maker Rolls-Royce is another big faller on the Footsie, with the shares down nearly 2%. It said it needs to ramp up inspections on its problematic Trent 1000 engines, leading to extra disruption for customers and additional costs. The company is in a the middle of a restructuring led by chief executive Warren East, but its turnaround has been held back by problems with some turbine blades that have worn out faster than expected. The company said it had decided to increase the number of inspections after coming across a new problem with the compressor on Trent 1000 engines, which are installed on Boeing 787s. East said: We sincerely regret the disruption this will cause to our customers. Our team of technical experts and service engineers is working around the clock to ensure we return them to full service as soon as possible. We will be working closely with Boeing and affected airlines to minimise disruption wherever possible. The FTSE 100 index is slightly negative, trading down some 6 points at 7251.70, while the FTSE 250 is also down, by 0.2%, or 41 points to 19732.13. Shopping centre operator Hammerson is the biggest faller on the FTSE 250 index after bigger French rival Kl\u00e9pierre abandoned attempts to buy the company behind Birmingham\u2019s Bullring and Brent Cross in London. Hammerson shares are down 12.7% at 454.1p, while Kl\u00e9pierre rose 4.3%. Two days ago, Hammerson rejected a revised 635p-a-share proposal from Kl\u00e9pierre, up from its initial offer of 615p a share, to be paid in cash and shares \u2013 valuing the company at around \u00a35bn. But Hammerson said the new proposal was only 3% higher and still undervalued its business. The French company said it was walking away because Hammerson failed to provide \u201cmeaningful engagement\u201d after the sweetened proposal this week. The board of Hammerson did not provide any meaningful engagement with respect to the increased proposal and, after careful consideration, Kl\u00e9pierre has concluded that it does not intend to make an offer for Hammerson. This means Hammerson can push ahead with its planned \u00a33.4bn acquisition of smaller UK rival Intu to create Britain\u2019s biggest property company worth \u00a321bn. Intu owns the Trafford centre in Manchester. But what do shareholders think? Oil prices are slipping after Trump toned down his threat of missile strikes in Syria on Thursday. Brent crude in London is down 0.2% at $71.89 \u2013 but is up 7% this week \u2013 while US crude has edged down 0.15% at $66.92 a barrel. Both benchmarks have risen about $5 this week, putting them on track for the biggest weekly gains since July. They hit their highest level since late 2014 on Wednesday after Trump warned \u201cmissiles will be coming\u201d in Syria after a chemical attack on civilians and Saudi Arabia said it intercepted missiles from Yemen over Riyadh. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. As tensions over Syria ease, trade is back in focus today. US president Donald Trump has held out the prospect of rejoining the Trans Pacific Partnership, a multinational trade pact his government walked away from last year \u2013 but only if it offered \u201csubstantially better\u201d terms than those provided in previous negotiations. His comments on Twitter came just hours after he told Republican senators that he had asked US trade representative Robert Lighthizer and White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow to re-open negotiations. Trump\u2019s comments were greeted with caution in the Asia-Pacific region. Japanese finance minister Taro Aso told reporters after a cabinet meeting, before Trump\u2019s tweet: If it\u2019s true, I would welcome it. He added that Trump \u201cis a person who could change temperamentally, so he may say something different the next day\u201d. New Zealand\u2019s prime minister Jacinda Ardern also expressed some scepticism. If the United States, it turns out, do genuinely wish to rejoin, that triggers a whole new process. The TPP, which has 11 members, was set up to lower trade barriers in the Asia-Pacific region and to counter China\u2019s growing clout. Trump pulled the US out of the pact in early 2017, citing concerns about US jobs. The news came as new data showed China\u2019s exports unexpectedly fell in March, the first drop since February 2017. The country ran up a rare trade deficit of $4.98bn for the month, also the first since February last year. Chinese exports dropped 2.7% last month from a year earlier while imports grew 14.4%, more than expected, according to customs data. Analysts had been expecting a surplus of $27.2bn, following February\u2019s surplus of $33.75bn. The export outlook has been clouded by an escalating trade dispute with the US. China\u2019s trade surplus with the US fell to $15.3bn in March from $21bn in February. In the first quarter, its trade surplus with the US rose 19.4% from a year earlier to $58.25bn. US bank earnings will also be in focus today, with JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Wells Fargo reporting first-quarter results.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Jaguar Land Rover is to cut 1,000 jobs in the West Midlands, blaming a slump in car sales due to uncertainty over Brexit and the future of diesel vehicles. Britain\u2019s biggest carmaker will cut 1,000 temporary contract workers at its plant in Solihull, which builds Range Rovers and the Land Rover Discovery SUV. The factory employs 10,000 workers, including 2,000 contract staff. The company, which employs 40,000 people in the UK, will move some workers from its factory at nearby Castle Bromwich to fill gaps left by the cuts at Solihull. It is due to confirm the cuts, first reported by ITV News, and a reduction in output at Solihull as part of an update on production plans for its workforce on Monday. The cuts are understood to have been triggered by a 26% drop in JLR sales in the UK in the first three months of 2018. Sales in Germany, Europe\u2019s biggest car market, also slumped, dropping 32% in the same period. JLR sold a record 621,109 vehicles worldwide in 2017, up 6.5% from a year earlier. But while international sales boomed, UK sales fell 15.8% because of weakening consumer confidence. The company is expected to say on Monday that customers are delaying buying new cars because of concerns about government policies on diesel cars. Consumer confidence in the UK had also been hit by uncertainty over Brexit. In a statement, JLR referred to Brexit and diesel taxes obliquely as \u201cheadwinds\u201d. It said: \u201cIn light of the continuing headwinds impacting the car industry, we are making some adjustments to our production schedules and the level of agency staff. We are however continuing to recruit large numbers of highly skilled engineers, graduates and apprentices as we over-proportionally invest in new products and technologies.\u201d JLR\u2019s decision reflects a wider malaise for the UK car industry as consumers put off big purchases amid squeezed household budgets and doubts about the economy. Sales of new cars in the UK plunged in March as uncertainty weighed on demand and buyers turned their backs on diesel, extending the run of falling sales to 12 months. JLR warned in January that hostility towards diesel vehicles and uncertainty over Brexit were affecting its business. The company, owned by India\u2019s Tata Motors, cut production at its Halewood plant in Liverpool, blaming faltering sales, and warned that tough conditions would continue. JLR said it was fully committed to its UK factories after investing \u00a34bn in them since 2010. Brexit has added to consumer concerns, prompting potential customers to delay new car purchases, but JLR will stress that its long-term production plans remain unchanged. Britain has increased the amount of vehicle excise duty paid by almost everyone buying a new diesel car from this month. Diesel accounts for around 90% of JLR\u2019s UK sales. The UK car industry, which employs 169,000 people, has warned that thousands of UK jobs are at risk because of the tax increase and a backlash against diesel vehicles on environmental grounds. Sales of diesel-powered vehicles dropped by 17% in 2017 but still represented almost 38% of car sales. The UK government has said it will ban sales of new diesel and petrol cars by 2040 to improve air quality and public health. The Royal College of Physicians has warned bad air quality could be responsible for 40,000 premature deaths a year. Campaigners have called for the government to bring the ban forward to 2030. Scotland is aiming for 2032 as its cutoff date. A German court ruled in February that cities have the right to ban diesel motors to improve air-quality levels. The ruling left millions of drivers questioning how they would travel to work and school if there was a ban and wondering what to do with vehicles likely to plunge in value. Car buyers in the UK are also shunning diesel vehicles after the Volkswagen emissions scandal of 2015. The German carmaker was found to have cheated regulators and misled customers by using software to suppress emissions of nitrogen oxide during vehicle tests.",

      "bodyText": "The build-up of financial risk in Australia\u2019s households has finally started to ease, but the worryingly-high level of household debt we have accumulated in recent years will take years to wear off, the Reserve Bank says. The RBA has published its latest review of the health of the financial system. It shows the RBA is pleased with regulators\u2019 efforts to strengthen lending standards in Australian in recent years, saying there are fewer concerns about riskier types of new housing borrowing than there were 12 months ago. But it has drawn attention to the high level of household debt, saying it increases the risk of future economic negative shocks being amplified across the economy. \u201cThe ratio of total household debt to income has increased by almost 30 percentage points over the past five years to almost 190%, after having been broadly unchanged for close to a decade,\u201d the review says. \u201cAustralia\u2019s household debt-to-income ratio is high relative to many other advanced economies, including some that have also continued to see strong growth in household lending in the post-crisis period, such as Canada, New Zealand and Sweden. \u201cHousehold debt in these economies is notably higher than in those that were more affected by the financial crisis and experienced deleveraging, including Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States.\u201d Economists say it is unsurprising that the RBA is continuing to warn about vulnerabilities in household balance sheets, but say most aggregate indicators of financial stress remain low. \u201cOverall ... regulatory measures and broader strengthening of lending standards have contributed to an improvement in the risk profile of new housing lending and the resilience of household balance sheets,\u201d Commonwealth Bank economists John Peters and Michael Workman said. \u201cThey have also contributed to the recent moderation in housing market conditions.\u201d The RBA says global economic conditions have remained strong in the past six months, helping to further improve the health of the global banking system generally. The review comes after RBA governor Philip Lowe said this week Australia\u2019s painful run of record low wages growth may have finally troughed, with economic conditions improving in every region across Australia as the remnants of the destabilising wind-down in mining investment finally disappear. He said the economy was likely to grow more strongly over the next two years than it did last year as non-mining investment increased, exports continued to grow, and more people found jobs, leading to a pick-up in wages growth and inflation. \u201cThe latest data suggest that the rate of wages has now troughed, with a pick-up evident in the most recent quarter,\u201d Lowe said during a speech in Perth. \u201cA further lift is expected, but it is likely to be only gradual,\u201d he said. The Turnbull government welcomed the expectation that Australia\u2019s run of record-low wages growth may be over, given this week\u2019s news that the government has now trailed Labor for 30 consecutive Newspolls. The RBA says it is keeping a close eye on the health of the home loan market given \u201cthe risk from the stock of existing loans remains.\u201d But it says the resilience of household balance sheets has stopped deteriorating, thanks to improvements in lending standards that have \u201ccontributed to a significant improvement in the risk profile of new lending over the past couple of years.\u201d",
