      "bodyText": "More than 1,000 subpostmasters who claim they were wrongly accused of theft or false accounting could join a class action against the Post Office to clear their names. The case could result in a payout of tens of millions to the subpostmasters, who say that a faulty IT system led to accounting shortfalls. Many lost their jobs and were forced to pay back thousands of pounds that had gone missing from their branches, while some were given prison sentences. The legal firm Freeths, which is leading the action, said hundreds of current and former subpostmasters had come forward since a group litigation order was granted in January, and that many more might do so before the deadline of 26 July. \u201cOur claim goes back to 1999, the year when the Horizon IT system was installed. There are thousands and thousands of subpostmasters out there who may be entitled to join the group claim \u2026 the potential pool of claimants is very significant, but we just don\u2019t know how many people will come forward over the next few months,\u201d said James Hartley, a partner with Freeths. The claimant group says that the Post Office failed in its legal duty because it held subpostmasters responsible for financial losses before properly investigating shortfalls and failed to inform individuals that their cases were not isolated incidents. It is also claimed that Post Office personnel harassed the subpostmasters involved \u2013 alleged incidents include Post Office employers acting aggressively while interrogating subpostmasters, and searching individuals\u2019 homes. A review by forensic accountants Second Sight, published in 2015, found the Post Office had failed to investigate irregularities at sub-post offices before launching civil and criminal inquiries. Alan Bates, who set up the campaign group Justice for Subpostmasters Alliance after his contract with the Post Office ended in 2003, hoped the case would bring the Post Office to account. \u201cWe want to expose the truth. They\u2019ve had more than one opportunity to come forward and put their hands up and say \u2018look, we know there\u2019s things that we\u2019ve not got right\u2019, but we\u2019re going to have to do that through the courts. We just want it known how badly the Post Office has treated people. They\u2019ve ruined lives the length and breadth of this country. It\u2019s not just one person \u2013 the subpostmaster \u2013 who\u2019s affected, it\u2019s whole families.\u201d Scott Darlington, who ran a Post Office in Alderley Edge, Cheshire, received a suspended prison sentence, 120 hours\u2019 community service and a \u00a3410 fine after he was convicted of false accounting. He first started noticing problems with Horizon when it reported that he was \u00a31,700 down on stamps. He reported the shortfall to the Post Office and was made to repay the money. \u201cI just thought something will come back \u2013 this is far too much for this to be some kind of accounting error.\u201d Six months later he faced a \u00a344,000 shortfall and was accused of false accounting. \u201cI can\u2019t really tell you how bad it\u2019s been,\u201d he said. \u201cMy whole life has been turned upside down. Once you have a criminal record, for a start, doing 120 hours of community service that took six months because I was only allowed to do it on a Friday. I was signing on, I was getting housing benefit. I\u2019d been earning \u00a335k a year up until this point. I couldn\u2019t get a job for three-and-a-half years.\u201d Parallel to the group litigation order, the Criminal Cases Review Commission is looking at more than 30 cases where subpostmasters received convictions to decide if some were unsafe. If so, they will be referred to the appeal court and could be overturned. Tracey Merritt, who was accused by auditors of theft and false accounting at her branch in Yetminster \u2013 though they have since dropped the charges \u2013 said the Post Office had failed to provide adequate training in Horizon or to give any support when problems occurred. Merritt lost her post office and shop, and faced hefty solicitors\u2019 fees and abuse from some members of the community. She wants her name cleared. The Post Office said in a statement: \u201cThe Post Office welcomes the group litigation order as offering the best opportunity for the matters in dispute to be heard and resolved. We will not otherwise comment on litigation while it is ongoing. We continue to have confidence in the Horizon system, which has around 78,000 users across 11,600 branches nationwide to process six million transactions a day.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Coalition won't budge despite chance to tackle housing policy | Greg Jericho", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "With just over five weeks to go till the budget, the government appears locked into defending Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s old statements and positions, rather than reacting to issues in a way that could help deliver a budget that signals it is more in tune with the policies and politics of a post-financial crisis world. In the past couple of weeks, the housing policy issue has undergone a change. For a long while now, the talk has been all about affordability \u2013 what to do to help those looking to buy their first home. Now the focus has shifted to a housing bubble. The two issues are clearly linked \u2013 the reason housing affordability is such an issue is because prices in Sydney and Melbourne have been rising much faster than incomes. That the rise has been occurring for several years brings into question just how sustainable the market is. And so the shift is not just about making housing more affordable, but taking out some of the air in the market without bursting the bubble. This puts the government in a tricky spot \u2013 although it\u2019s one of their own making. This time last year, housing affordability had reached such a state that the Labor party went into the election with a policy to curb negative gearing. Such a move would have been viewed as political suicide at pretty much every previous election. It would have been good policy \u2013 just tough politics. Sometimes it takes a while for politics to catch up with the policy. But that the ALP went within a whisker of knocking over a first-term government was a very good sign that negative gearing was no longer a sacred cow. And yet there is little to indicate the government will make a move in this area in next month\u2019s budget. It could have got a whiff of the wind last year when the Labor party came up with its policy. It would have been very easy for the government to criticise the ALP\u2019s policy to limit negative gearing to new housing as one that would distort the housing market and not actually solve the problem, and instead come up with its own measure \u2013 such as limiting the number of properties that could be negative geared, or capping the dollar amount that could be claimed. On the capital gains tax (CGT) front, where the ALP proposes halving the discount from 50% to 25%, the government could again have argued that such a policy was too reckless and instead proposed that the discount be reduced to 40%. After all, that was the level recommended by the Henry tax Review, which would have given the government plenty of political and policy cover. But no. Instead, despite the Treasury investigating the policy, the prime minister took the nuclear response, suggesting the ALP\u2019s policies would \u201csmash\u201d the value of people\u2019s homes and that they \u201cshould put concern into the minds of every single house owner\u201d. And so his position remains, while not only is the politics moving ever more away from him, but so too is the policy. Instead it appears we will get a \u201chousing affordability package\u201d. There will probably be some spending on transport infrastructure, assistance for renters \u2013 most likely something about social housing similar to that in the UK \u2013 talk about moves by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) to limit investor lending, but nothing that will go near taxation. And yet negative gearing and capital gains tax are clearly the big drivers of the instability in the market \u2013 because they are the drivers for people to take out multiple interest-only loans, about which the Reserve Bank governor expressed concern this week. Mostly we are in this position because Turnbull has painted himself into a corner. His language to attack the ALP\u2019s policy was so over the top that it is hard to walk back from. He also uses the same talking points to argue against reducing the CGT discount as he does for cutting company taxes. Repeatedly, over the past year, the prime minister has argued that \u201cif you want people to do less of something, you put up the tax\u201d. Last year he used it to argue against increasing the CGT (which is what reducing the discount would do), and this year he has used it to argue in favour of cutting the company tax rate to 25%. The government\u2019s struggles to sell the company tax cut plan are a good example of the politics and the policy shifting again beneath its feet. There was a time when talk of cutting taxes to improve economic growth would have been relatively safe, but the impact of policies on inequality and, in turn, the impact of inequality on growth has come to the fore over the past few years. It is a world now where the former Reserve Bank governor Bernie Fraser criticises the move to cut company tax as \u201canother illustration of ... an increasing trend towards unfairness in so many ways in policy\u201d. Rather than react, the government continues with its policy \u2013 but the politics is done badly. We\u2019re at a point where the treasurer is demanding that big business help with the sales pitch \u2013 and where the prime minister continues to argue for the company tax rate cut with ardent fervour, telling the Sydney Institute \u201cno other single tax reform by the commonwealth can do more to grow the economy\u201d. And so the government appears wedded to its previous positions, unable to move with the times. On both housing and company tax, the policy and the political ground has shifted away from it, and with little time before the budget, it would seem it is unwilling to react. That will be bad for the government \u2013 both in terms of policy and politics.",

      "bodyText": "Eight years into Greece\u2019s ordeal to escape bankruptcy, thousands of Communist party sympathisers packed into Syntagma Square in Athens on Friday to protest at the latest concessions made by Alexis Tsipras\u2019s leftist government to keep the country afloat. Massed before parliament in the fading light of day, they did what they had come to do: rail against the cuts that loom in return for further disbursement of the emergency aid now needed to avert economic collapse. The serial drama of Greece\u2019s debt repayments will reach a climax again when loans of \u20ac7.5bn mature in July. That communist-aligned unionists can still muster such protests is testament to the party\u2019s zealous determination to make itself heard. Most Greeks gave up demonstrating long ago. Two years short of a decade in freefall, and with little prospect of recovery, the nation has succumbed to protest fatigue. With the exception of pensioners \u2013 the great losers in Greece\u2019s assault by austerity \u2013 anger has been replaced by malaise, the lassitude that strikes when loss becomes commonplace. Friday\u2019s protest, one of more than 60 nationwide, came within hours of Europe escaping another dose of Greek drama after eurozone finance ministers announced that bailout talks \u2013 stalled as Athens bickered over the terms of its latest compliance review with lenders \u2013 could finally resume. International auditors representing the bodies behind the three bailout packages the country has received since May 2010 are expected to return to Greece on Monday. Once technical issues are addressed, the delayed bailout payment will be disbursed, ensuring default is averted in July. In exchange, the once fiercely anti-austerity Tsipras has signed up to further reforms worth \u20ac3.6bn, the equivalent of 2% of GDP, to be put into effect once the current programme ends next year. \u201cIt is in the nature of every agreement for there to be compromises,\u201d said Greek finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos, who faces the thankless task of having to sell the prospect of more pension cuts and tax rises to sceptical leftists in the ruling Syriza party when it convenes on Sunday. \u201cThere are things that will upset \u2026 the Greek people.\u201d After more than a year of hard talk and bluster \u2013 the review was meant to have been concluded in February 2016 \u2013 the government once again conceded on its own red lines, reflecting Athens\u2019s overarching policy of keeping Greece in the heart of the eurozone. Tsipras, who fought hard to ensure countermeasures can also be taken to offset losses if economic indicators are better than expected, was quick to sound optimistic. \u201cThe Greek economy,\u201d he announced, \u201cis ready to leave the crisis behind it.\u201d But the breakthrough falls far short of the all-inclusive package the government was hoping for. Once again, promises of reducing the country\u2019s staggering debt pile \u2013 at 180% of GDP, the biggest impediment to real economic recovery \u2013 will have to wait. The International Monetary Fund, which has steadfastly refused to finance the latest bailout until meaningful debt forgiveness is assured, repeated that without \u201ca credible strategy\u201d it would be unable to even present the programme to its own board. Without the IMF formally signed up, many are reluctant to get into a party mood. \u201cIn the circumstances it was the best the government could get, but in essence it only prolongs the crisis, it doesn\u2019t solve it,\u201d said Syriza MEP Stelios Kouloglou. \u201cPersonally I neither trust the IMF nor [German finance minister Wolfgang] Sch\u00e4uble. The IMF is still waiting for Trump to clarify his policy on Europe, and Germany is in the midst of an election campaign.\u201d In the standoff, the Greek economy has shown grave signs of slippage. This year was meant to be a year of recovery \u2013 instead, the uncertainty has prompted the central bank to revise its growth projection downwards following the economy\u2019s contraction in the fourth quarter last year. Unemployment has increased from 23.2% to 23.5%, with investors \u2013 the only guarantee of soaking up such an oversupply of labour \u2013 staying away. In a repeat of the chaos that beset the country\u2019s financial system at the height of the crisis in 2015, an estimated \u20ac2.5bn of deposits left Greek banks in January and February. Consumption is also down. \u201cThe 37% of Greeks at risk of poverty and social exclusion really cannot make ends meet,\u201d said Aliki Mouriki, a leading Greek sociologist. \u201cThey no longer have the means to meet basic needs, with consumption of milk and bread right down and payment of electricity bills at an all-time low.\u201d The situation on the ground contrasts greatly with the expressions of optimism leading EU officials are prone to offer. But seasoned observers say the language used about Greece ceased to have any real meaning long ago. The nation long at the centre of the eurozone\u2019s economic crisis still remains its weakest link. The latest d\u00e9tente buys Athens more time \u2013 and Tsipras further time in office \u2013 but it is far from being a lifeline. By the summer of 2018, when Greece\u2019s current \u20ac86bn adjustment programme ends, few believe that Athens will be able to get access to international markets or avoid a fourth bailout. \u201cIn the interval Tsipras will rot and Greece will rot with him,\u201d said Dimitris Keridis, a political science professor at Panteion University and a prominent commentator. Keridis is among those who believe that \u201cGrexit\u201d is still a possibility. \u201cThere is growing Euroscepticism among Greeks. The country is no longer the systemic threat to the rest of Europe that it was at the beginning of the crisis, and that means there is less incentive to keep it in. If the economy doesn\u2019t pick up, Grexit will be back on the table.\u201d It is a view held by many in the large-windowed, carpeted offices of MEPs in Brussels. Until now Europe has muddled through on Greece, rallying with professions of euro unity when the shockwave of Brexit hit last summer. With the bloc potentially facing other existential crises \u2013 in France, where victory in May\u2019s presidential election for the far-right Marine Le Pen has not been ruled out, and in Italy, where the Eurosceptic Five Star Movement has a real chance of winning elections next year \u2013 the risk of its geography changing cannot be ruled out. As the union\u2019s soft underbelly, Greece is unlikely to be spared. Entirely reliant on the European Central Bank for funding, its banks would automatically become the biggest transmission mechanism for a spreading crisis. \u201cThe EU is buying time, governments are buying time, the Greek political system is buying time,\u201d said Giorgos Kyrtsos, a Greek MEP with the conservative New Democracy party, looking out at the grey skies above Brussels. \u201cThere are two Grexit scenarios. One made in Greece, the result of the inability to restart the economy. And one made in the eurozone because of political developments in France or Italy. In my view, the big danger is the permanent political and economic crisis in Italy. You can\u2019t have Greece trapped in the eurozone if Italy leaves.\u201d The alternative is more muddling through: but how long Greece can continue bumping along the bottom, without the risk of implosion or political tumult, is far from certain.",
