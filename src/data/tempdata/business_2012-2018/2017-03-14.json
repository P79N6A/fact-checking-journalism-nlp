      "bodyText": "Hundreds of high street jobs are at risk at Jones Bootmaker as the retailer teeters on the brink of administration. The 160-year-old chain, which is owned by private equity firm Alteri, has filed a notice of intention to appoint administrators as it seeks a buyer. Alteri has been in negotiations to sell the business and is understood to have received credible offers. However, filing the administration notice protects the retailer from creditors looking to recover debts. There is no certainty that Jones Bootmaker will fall into administration. It could still be sold as a going concern or through a pre-pack administration whereby the company goes into insolvency proceedings but its assets are immediately bought by a new owner. The filing of the notice to appoint administrators was first reported by Retail Week. Alteri is being advised by accountancy firm KPMG. Jones Bootmaker has about 100 shops and 800 employees in the UK. The problems for the retailer come as the high street battles against the rise of online shopping and business rates. Despite Philip Hammond\u2019s attempt to heed concerns about business rates with a \u00a3435m relief package in last week\u2019s budget, retailers have warned that their bill will still rise from April due to a revaluation of Britain\u2019s property. The British Retail Consortium, the industry trade body, has warned that more than 8,000 shops and 80,000 jobs could be lost by 2020 due to the pressure on the retail industry. Agent Provocateur, the upmarket lingerie retailer, was bought earlier this month by Mike Ashley through a pre-pack administration. Pre-packs have been heavily criticised because they allow businesses to shed debts to creditors, which can include suppliers and the taxman. Alteri bought Jones two years ago in a \u00a312m deal which included the rival shoe retailer Brantano. Six months ago it appointed David Riddiford \u2013 a retail veteran who has had roles at Links of London and Ireland\u2019s largest department store Arnotts \u2013 as executive chairman. After starting with one store in Bayswater, London, in 1857 Jones Bootmaker has expanded across the UK. The business had humble beginnings. It was opened by Alfred Jones and his wife Emma who kept the story open from 8am to 8pm, and midnight on Saturdays, while looking after 11 sons and three daughters.

    "webTitle": "Q&A: What will happen if the Federal Reserve raises US interest rates?", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The US central bank is poised to raise interest rates for only the third time since the financial crash of 2008. With its headquarters just round the corner from the White House, the Federal Reserve and its chair, Janet Yellen, are in Donald Trump\u2019s sights. On the campaign trail Trump said Yellen should be \u201cashamed\u201d of the Fed\u2019s low interest rate policy, and accused the bank of creating a \u201cfalse stock market\u201d. Trump has called for higher rates, but Yellen can not take a positive presidential reaction for granted. The reaction of markets across the world is even less predictable. So what is the likely impact on the US and the global economy? What is the Fed expected to do? The Federal Reserve raised the base interest rate by a quarter of a percent in December last year and is expected to follow with a further rate rise on Wednesday. Some analysts expect a quarter-point rise, though most of the betting is now on a half point, pushing the base rate to a range of 1% to 1.25%. Why will it raise rates? The US economy has grown for the last 30 quarters and shows no sign of slackening off. Consumer spending is robust and the latest jobs numbers showed employment increasing and unemployment staying low. Fathom Consulting, an economic forecaster, said spare capacity in the labour market was disappearing fast and it would not be long before wages started to rise rapidly. Wage rises push up demand, and that triggers higher prices. The Fed has a remit to control inflation, but also to mintain high levels of employment. By raising rates, it will appear to do both. How will consumers and corporate America react? The Fed is betting businesses will shrug off the extra cost of borrowing, continue to invest in the US economy and create jobs. Setting aside concerns about Brexit and a string of potentially destabilising elections on the continent, Fed policymakers have judged that the strength of the economy is enough to override a series of rate rises, possibly taking the base rate to almost 2% by the end of next year. Consumers have embraced the Trump rhetoric of tax cuts and deregulation to continue spending, undeterred by the prospect of higher mortgage costs. How will the market react? Central banks like to signal their intentions, albeit in opaque language, to prevent investors being spooked. This rise was heavily trailed in recent weeks and has been priced in as a certainty by market participants in New York, London and Tokyo \u2013 though some would be surprised by a half-point rise. Turbulence could come from the foreign exchange markets if the dollar rises following a slump in the Turkish lira, Indonesian rupiah, Mexican peso or other developing world currency. More importantly, the bond markets could overreact. Why do the bond markets matter? Much of the world borrows money in dollars or seeks to lend to the US government and US corporations in dollars. A rise in interest rates would encourage an influx of funds into the US, pushing up the dollar relative to other countries. A rise in the Fed funds rate would also increase the cost of borrowing. When the Fed first hinted in 2013 that it planned to stop pumping funds into the financial system, the prospect of higher borrowing costs for those holding dollar debts spooked the bond markets. Turkey and Russia were highlighted as countries with corporate sectors that expanded quickly based on heavy borrowing using dollar-denominated bonds. It was clear that much of Turkey\u2019s corporate sector could go bust if its interest bill jumped too far or fast. Such was the strength of the reaction, Ben Bernanke, who at the time chaired the Federal Reserve, abandoned his plan. A similar reaction preceded a rate rise in December 2015, and while markets regained their composure, the extra costs imposed on Turkey and Russia hit their economies hard and arguably shored up the position of their authoritarian leaders. Is a currency war possible? Trump has already attacked China for artificially depressing its currency, even when Beijing was doing all it could to close the gap between the yen and the dollar. Now China is letting the yen fall and with interest rate rises in the US pushing up the dollar, the gap will widen, increasing the cost of US exports and reducing import prices. Trump can only complain about the currency, but he could make good on threats to impose tariffs on Chinese goods, sparking a trade war. Is there any reason to keep rates on hold? Annual US GDP growth since the 2008 crash has averaged 2.1%. This might seem like a healthy rate, but it is the slowest recovery from recession since the second world war. Business investment remains low and productivity in the US, as elsewhere in the developed world, is growing sluggishly. To boost borrowing and demand, the Fed needs to keep credit cheap. But Trump plans to make up for the tightening of monetary policy by cutting taxes and running up a huge budget deficit. He also plans to take his shears to corporate and consumer regulations, unleashing a surge in economic activity. Bloomberg said investors expect three more rises before the end of the year. Fathom Consulting said there was enough momentum in the economy for rate increases of 25 basis points seven times between now and the end of next year.",

Turkey and Russia were highlighted as countries with corporate sectors that expanded quickly based on heavy borrowing using dollar-denominated bonds. It was clear that much of Turkey\u2019s corporate sector could go bust if its interest bill jumped too far or fast.</p> <p>Such was the strength of the reaction, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/ben-bernanke\">Ben Bernanke</a>, who at the time chaired the Federal Reserve, abandoned his plan. A similar reaction preceded a rate rise in December 2015, and while markets regained their composure, the extra costs imposed on Turkey and Russia hit their economies hard and arguably shored up the position of their authoritarian leaders.</p> <p><strong>Is a currency war possible?</strong><br></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/04/trump-foreign-policy-faces-scrutiny-as-team-defends-taiwan-phone-call\">Trump has already attacked China for artificially depressing its currency</a>, even when Beijing was doing all it could to close the gap between the yen and the dollar. Now China is letting the yen fall and with interest rate rises in the US pushing up the dollar, the gap will widen, increasing the cost of US exports and reducing import prices. </p> <p>Trump can only complain about the currency, but he could make good on threats to impose tariffs on Chinese goods, sparking a trade war.</p> <p><strong>Is there any reason to keep rates on hold?</strong></p> <p>Annual US GDP growth since the 2008 crash has averaged 2.1%. This might seem like a healthy rate, but it is the slowest recovery from recession since the second world war. Business investment remains low and productivity in the US, as elsewhere in the developed world, is growing sluggishly. To boost borrowing and demand, the Fed needs to keep credit cheap.</p> <p>But Trump plans to make up for the tightening of monetary policy by cutting taxes and running up a huge budget deficit. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/feb/03/trump-dodd-frank-act-executive-order-financial-regulations\">He also plans to take his shears to corporate and consumer regulations</a>, unleashing a surge in economic activity.</p> <p>Bloomberg said investors expect three more rises before the end of the year. Fathom Consulting said there was enough momentum in the economy for rate increases of 25 <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/basispoint.asp\">basis points</a> seven times between now and the end of next year.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Hipster culture is officially mainstream after the rising popularity of vegan diets, cycling and artisan gin were reflected in the annual shakeup of the shopping basket used to measure UK inflation. Non-dairy milks made from soya, rice and almonds have made it into to the basket for the first time, reflecting the growing trend of dairy-free diets according to the Office for National Statistics. Gin and cycling helmets also made a return to the basket after long absences, while menthol cigarettes and basic mobile phone handsets are out. The ONS updates the basket once a year to better reflect the lifestyle of the modern consumer in Britain. \u201cThe once-parodied trappings of hipster subculture \u2013 from well-groomed beards to a taste for the retro \u2013 appear to have become increasingly mainstream in the last few years,\u201d said Jonathan Athow, deputy national statistician for economic statistics at the ONS. \u201cSo perhaps it isn\u2019t a surprise to see items in the latest basket of goods and services which seem as though they could be at home in a hipster household.\u201d Children\u2019s scooters are also in, replacing swings. Fees for stopping cheques are out, while council tax has been included. The ONS said charities such as Veganuary, which campaign to change public attitudes and encourage people to try vegan for the month of January, had contributed to the growing popularity of non-dairy milk, increasingly thanks to lifestyle choices rather than decisions driven by allergies. \u201cA few years ago, those avoiding cow\u2019s milk because of lactose intolerance or for ethical reasons were drinking soya, but there\u2019s been a rising demand for alternative plant milk substitutes, including rice, hemp and \u2013 most popular \u2013 almond,\u201d the ONS said. Gin has been reintroduced after a 13-year absence. The ONS said the one-time favourite of the middle-aged suburban couple had become a staple of the younger drinker. Growth in the number of small gin producersand gin festivals have also helped to boost its popularity. The value of gin sold by manufacturers in the UK almost doubled from \u00a3126m in 2009 to \u00a3239m in 2015. Michael Andrews, the director of ambient buying for Waitrose, said gin sales had risen 16% over the past year. \u201cWith the UK experiencing a \u2018ginaissance\u2019, it\u2019s no wonder gin has entered back into the basket this year. It has consistently been our fastest-growing spirit and with so many new boutique brands entering the market this shows no sign of slowing.\u201d Bicycle helmets made it back into the basket after a 12-year absence, as the success of British cyclists such as Jason and Laura Kenny in the Olympics and Chris Froome in the Tour de France fuelled enthusiasm for the sport. The number of Brits interested in taking up cycling almost doubled in the last two years from one in 10 in 2014 to one in five in 2016, according to the market-research company Mintel. \u201cWhile cycling is famed for its Mamils [middle-aged men in lycra], Brits most likely to aspire to cycle are those aged 16 to 24, with young women more interested in cycling than young men,\u201d said David Walmsley, a senior leisure analyst at the firm. Paul Martin, the UK head of retail at the accountancy firm KPMG, said the changes to the inflation basket broadly reflected a growing trend of healthier living. \u201cThe ONS basket of goods offers a fascinating peek from behind the curtain at today\u2019s typical household shopping list,\u201d he said. \u201cAs in previous years, factors including changes in consumer tastes, technological advancements and the latest fads and trends all carve out a new, modern-day consumer. \u201cThe updated basket clearly mirrors the consumer shift towards health, fitness and Free From [gluten-free], as well as the resurgence of traditional tastes and activities, albeit often with a modern twist.\u201d Basic mobile handsets were ejected from the 2017 basket, pushed out by more popular smartphones and a reflection of changing technology and fewer models being available in the shops. The inflation basket dates back 70 years and now includes about 700 goods and services. The ONS uses it to collect about 180,000 individual prices each month from shops across the UK and online. It then uses weights for each item \u2013 their relative importance in calculating inflation \u2013 based on survey evidence of people\u2019s spending, and comes up with an inflation figure for the whole economy. The headline rate of annual inflation in the UK is currently 1.8%. It is expected to rise in the coming months as the impact of the sharp drop in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote feeds through into prices. Alistair McQueen, the head of savings and retirement at Aviva, said looking at the basket over the past decade was like a \u201ctrip down memory lane\u201d, with technological advances a big driver of recent changes. When the basket was first compiled in 1947, prices were collected for about 200 items including corsets, mangles and wireless licences, items which are no longer included. Many items remain the same, however, including tickets to football matches, haircuts, and several types of fruit and vegetables. Technological changes are clear. In 1947, there were just three items listed under electrical appliances - vacuum cleaners, irons and radio sets. Black and white televisions were included in 1950, and fridges in the 1960s.

      "bodyText": "Worries about Brexit, as well as a second Scottish referendum, sent the pound to an eight week low of $1.2106 against the dollar. The US currency was also boosted by the prospect of a rate rise from the Federal Reserve on Wednesday. But sterling has since recovered from its lows, although it is still down 0.47% at $1.2160. Against the euro, the pound has fallen 0.29% to \u20ac1.1435 having earlier been as low as \u20ac1.1382. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: Despite the fact that the pound is hugely undervalued by historical standards, the uncertainty surrounding the future of the UK means we find little to be bullish about for the pound as we face confrontational negotiations. One could be excused for feeling we have had quite enough referendums over the past year, yet with Scotland seeking a second vote, there are plenty of reasons to question what the UK will look like in just over two years\u2019 time. On that note, it is time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. A fall in the oil price, uncertainty over Brexit and a second Scottish referendum along with some caution ahead of an expected US interest rate rise on Wednesday and the Dutch election left equity markets in Europe lower on the day. Commodity companies came under pressure on the back of the drop in crude prices, while banks were also unwanted. Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group were particularly weak on the renewed concerns about Scottish independence. The French market dropped back on the latest twist in the presidential campaign while Italy and Spain also struggled. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 0.13% or 9.23 points at 7357.85 Germany\u2019s Dax dipped 0.01% to 11,988.79 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.51% lower at 4974.26 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 0.86% to 19,537.40 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 0.91% at 9905.1 In Greece, the Athens market dropped 1.89% to 638.92 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 41 points or 0.2%. A second Scottish referendum which lead to a vote for independence would be \u201ca negative credit shock\u201d for the UK economy and public finances, and could lead to a rating downgrade, according to a new report by Fitch. The agency, which has a AA rating with a negative outlook on the UK, said: We believe Scottish independence would have adverse effects on the UK public finances and economy and so would be credit negative for the UK, as we have previously stated. Key uncertainties include the impact on the future trade relationship between the two countries, the financial sector and Scotland\u2019s currency arrangements. Scottish independence would lead to an increase in the ratio of UK government debt to GDP. The UK government stated ahead of the September 2014 referendum that it would in all circumstances honour its issued stock of UK debt if Scotland voted for independence. This would lead to a one-off increase of around 8% of GDP in the UK gross public debt ratio as Scotland dropped out of UK GDP, on the basis of latest estimates of UK and Scottish GDP. At the same time, we would assume that Scotland would be responsible for a proportionate share of existing public debt in the form of a long-term bilateral loan, giving the UK an off-setting claim on Scotland. This UK asset would be taken into account in our judgement of the overall position and sustainability of the UK\u2019s public finances. We recognise that a wide range of outcomes from Brexit is possible and we will continue to assess the UK sovereign rating as developments unfold. The Negative Outlook on the UK\u2019s \u2018AA\u2019 sovereign rating reflects the heightened uncertainty following the Brexit vote and the long-term challenge for the UK to reduce public debt. Ahead of this week\u2019s meeting of G20 finance ministers in Baden-Baden, the International Monetary Fund has called on the major economies to preserve the benefits of trade and avoid protectionism. With US president Trump showing protectionist tendencies and a propensity to rip up trade agreements, the IMF called for countries with trade and current account surpluses to work with countries with deficits to reduce these imbalances. IMF managing director Christine Lagarde said the global economy was improving but \u201cit would be a mistake to assume that it will automatically return to rude health.\u201d She added: In fact, there has rarely been a period when policy choices have mattered more for what comes next, especially since there are still considerable risks to the outlook... Above all, we should collectively avoid self-inflicted injuries. This requires steering clear of policies that would seriously undermine trade, migration, capital flows, and the sharing of technologies across borders. Such measures would hurt the productivity, incomes, and living standards of all citizens. European markets have edged back from their lows and are now virtually unchanged, with the exception of France. The FTSE 100 is down just 0.08%, while Germany\u2019s Dax has dipped 0.02%. But France\u2019s Cac has fallen 0.49% as the rightwing French presidential candidate Fran\u00e7ois Fillon was been placed under formal investigation for misuse of public funds. See our full report here: Worries about a new Scottish referendum appear to be at least part of the reason for a slump in Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group. RBS, down around 3% at the moment, and Lloyds, nearly 2% lower, both said they would relocate to England if the Scots voted for independence at the last referendum in 2014. Shore Capital analyst Gary Greenwood told Reuters: [They] both have sizeable Scottish operations, so it depends what...ultimately happens there and whether [Scotland] actually exits the UK and stays part of Europe. Back with oil, and the price is continuing to slide. Brent crude is now down 1.7% at $50.47 while West Texas Intermediate has fallen 2% to $47.40 after Saudi Arabia pumped more oil than expected in February. Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at Forex.com, said: After a significant drop last week, oil prices tried to stabilise themselves at the start of this week as both contracts ended Monday\u2019s session slightly higher. Among other things, short-covering was the reason behind the slightly firmer oil prices then. Brent and WTI started Tuesday\u2019s session on the front foot. However, they turned lower again by mid-morning before going into a mini free fall by midday. The latest drop was apparently in response to the OPEC\u2019s monthly oil report. While the OPEC acknowledged that compliance with the supply adjustments by OPEC and some non-OPEC producers supported prices and it raised its global oil demand forecast for 2017, it also raised its estimates for oil production from outside of the cartel. In the US, shale producers have ramped up drilling activity and increased oil output in response to higher prices. This has put serious question marks over the OPEC\u2019s attempts to balance the oil market. The bad weather in New York seems unlikely to hold back the Federal Reserve from raising US interest rates at the end of its two day meeting. Defying the elements, the Fed\u2019s latest gathering has apparently begun: And most analysts do indeed now expect an increase in borrowing costs following the recent strong economic data. Jordan Hiscott, chief trader at ayondo markets, said: It\u2019s almost certain we will see an increase in interest rates from the Federal Reserve tomorrow. The question now is not if they will increase, but by how much. The US economy added 235,000 jobs in February from non-farm payroll data, confirming a positive outlook for the US economy. Additionally, Wall Street is up 5% since the beginning of 2017 which is an impressive performance by any measure. There is much discussion about whether this uptrend can continue with the possibility of the highest interest rates since 2007...We have a generation of investors who have become accustomed to investments trends with the back drop of an extremely accommodative monetary policy from the FED. Going forward, with possible three rate increases for 2017 alone, I predict we will see trepidation for the equity markets in general. Eric Lascelles, chief economist at RBC Global Asset Management, agreed a rate rise was pretty much set in stone: Markets have fully priced the outcome, Fed speakers have shouted it from the rooftops and the aforementioned job figures confirm the continuation of American economic vibrancy. Because this is a \u201cmajor\u201d Fed meeting, with press conference and updated projections, there will be plenty of opportunities for the Fed to signal if it still believes three total tightening efforts are still appropriate for 2017, with another three scheduled for 2018. There is a risk that they upgrade this plan given economic strength. But our suspicion is that they won\u2019t, as the market already has a lot to digest given the sudden uptick in the pace of tightening from once per year to \u2013 for the moment \u2013 once per quarter. The Fed\u2019s economic growth projections should inch a little higher, though the extreme uncertainty surrounding U.S. fiscal policy suggests that any such movement should be tentative. The US stock market has opened cautiously, with the Dow Jones industrial average and the S&amp;P 500 index both dropping by around 0.2%. Energy stocks are down, following today\u2019s drop in the oil price. Financial stocks are also in the red, while consumer-focused shares are up. Traders face a struggle to get to their desks today, due to the snow that has hit New York, and beyond. Chris Beauchamp of IG predicts a quiet day on Wall Street.... US markets could well feel the effect of the blizzard that has descended on New York in the past few hours. We could be in for a volume-light session, compounding the probability of another snooze-fest for US markets ahead of tomorrow\u2019s Fed decision. Our economics editor, Larry Elliott, says Charlotte Hogg did the right thing by resigning -- and believes the Bank of England has lessons to learn over the affair. Hogg has done the right thing in resigning quickly. Better that than a long, drawn-out process that would eventually have ended with the same result. She was damaged goods. This incident shows that the system of oversight by the Treasury committee has worked. The grilling of Anthony Habgood, chairman of the Bank of England court, was forensic and showed MPs at their best. As the report noted, Hogg\u2019s departure raises wider concerns. The fact that Habgood had no inkling of Hogg\u2019s failure to disclose her brother\u2019s job suggests the Bank\u2019s governance is not all it should have been. Perhaps the most troubling aspect of the whole affair is that Habgood seemed to assume that because Hogg was an all-round good egg from a distinguished family he didn\u2019t need to ask too many questions. While the pound dips, the US dollar is strengthening as investors anticipate the first US interest rate rise of 2017 tomorrow afternoon. Even the snow hitting the east cost of America isn\u2019t likely to prevent the US Federal Reserve hiking borrowing costs, in response to the latest solid economic data. Chris Saint, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, says: \u201cThe pound\u2019s initial resilience to Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s confirmation that she will push for a second vote on Scottish independence dwindled in early morning trade today, with sterling slipping to 8-week lows against the US dollar near the $1.21 mark. News that any new referendum won\u2019t happen until late next year at the earliest may have softened the initial impact, but the UK\u2019s looming political challenges are still driving sentiment with reports suggesting Theresa May will trigger Article 50 in the final week of March after getting the green light to initiate formal Brexit proceedings from Parliament last night. Meanwhile, expectations that the Fed will lift US interest rates tomorrow and prime markets for more to follow later in the year are also lending support to the dollar.\u201d The oil price has taken another slide today, after Saudi Arabia revealed that it boosted production levels last month. New figures supplied to the Opec cartel show that Saudi pumped more than 10 million barrels per day in February. That means it has reversed some of the curbs it promised last November, when Opec agreed a historic deal to cut production. The news has knocked 1% off the cost of a barrel of Brent crude oil, which has dropped to $50.85 per barrel for the first time in four months. Here\u2019s Jill Treanor\u2019s story about Charlotte Hogg\u2019s resignation: Charlotte Hogg\u2019s departure is a big blow to efforts to get more women into top jobs at the Bank of England. Bloomberg\u2019s Jill Ward points out that men have dominated the monetary policy committee since it was created almost 20 years ago: The previous deputy governor, Minouche Shafik, is moving to run the London School of Economics, while professor Kristen Forbes is leaving the MPC in June when her first term expires. Having helped to prompt the end of Charlotte Hogg\u2019s career at the Bank of England, Andrew Tyrie MP has now welcomed her resignation. In a statement, the chair of the Treasury committee says: \u201cThis is a regrettable business with no winners. Ms Hogg has acted in the best interest of the institution for which she has been working. This is welcome. \u201cIt is also welcome that the Bank has responded immediately by announcing an internal review. The Bank\u2019s governance is already in much better shape than it was a few years ago. It is something to which the Governor and Court has been committed for some time. But there is clearly more to do. \u201cThe Treasury Committee will be examining the conclusions of this work in due course.\u201d As well as criticising Hogg\u2019s competence, today\u2019s report from the Treasury committee didn\u2019t cover the rest of the BoE in any glory. This exchange with BoE court chairman Anthony Habgood, during last week\u2019s session, was particularly excruciating: The financial markets have known for nine months that Britain was going to trigger the process of leaving the EU. But it seems that Brexit may not be \u2018priced in\u2019. George Saravelos, currency strategist at Deutsche Bank, believes that sterling could fall much further, and close to parity with the US dollar: \u201cI think the market is slowly starting to realise that Brexit is anything but priced in.\u201d \u201cHow can you price in an event of incredible complexity that has never happened before? We remain very bearish on the pound \u2014 our forecast is for a move close to $1.05.\u201d That\u2019s via the FT... Speaking of Brexit, one of the major groups in the European Parliament has backed a petition calling for UK citizens to be allowed to retain their EU citizenship rights after the break-up. ALDE is the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats, led by former Belgian PM Guy Verhofstadt. He\u2019s the European Parliament\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, and has warned that any Brexit deal could be voted down unless EU citizens in Britain get the right to remain. Back in the markets, the pound is still bobbing around an eight-week low as traders worry about Brexit, and a possible second vote on Scottish independence. Sterling is down almost one cent right now, at $1.2127. Against the euro, it\u2019s lost over half a eurocent at \u20ac1.141. Theresa May is due to update parliament about last week\u2019s European Council summit later today; a chance for MPs to express their views and concerns about Brexit. So far today, former UKIP leader Nigel Farage has voiced his disappointment that article 50 isn\u2019t being triggered today, while the UK government has warned that an independent Scotland would have to join the EU. Our Politics Live blog has all the details: Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s dramatic call for a new vote on Scottish independence is a serious complication to the Brexit story, says Mihir Kapadia, CEO of Sun Global Investments. The complex issue of Brexit has been further affected by the additional twist of the call for a second Scottish Independence Referendum. The previous Scottish Referendum was supposed to have settled the issue for a generation but the SNP now claims that Brexit decision has changed this, as 62% of Scots voted to remain in the EU. This complicates the task facing the UK government as they have won parliamentary authority to trigger Article 50, to initiate the process for pulling out of the EU. Further to last night\u2019s developments, the pound has now slumped into a two month low, at $1.2125. The lower pound is proving to be good for UK exports but inflation which is already showing signs of a significant revival could be boosted further.\u201d On a lighter note, gin and bicycle helmets are being included in the basket of goods used to track UK inflation. Both items were dropped over a decade ago, but have been brought back to reflect changing consumer habits. The Office for National Statistics says that: Gin consumption [is] on the rise, partly thanks to the significant growth in the number of small gin producers. Bicycle helmets are also returning to the basket after a 12-year absence, following the significant increase in the popularity of cycling due to sporting successes by British cyclists in the Olympics and the Tour De France. The ONS has also added \u201cno dairy milk\u201d items, such as soya, rice and oat milk; these \u201cFree From\u201d items have all risen in popularity in recent years. Basic mobile phone handsets have been dropped from the basket. In another tweak, the stats body has stopped tracking the price of child\u2019s swings, and replaced them with child\u2019s scooters. It\u2019s another attempt to better measure what parents spend money on: The number of price quotes collected for the swing has been falling reflecting its availability in shops particularly in the winter months and the change is an attempt to improve coverage of outdoor play equipment particularly in those winter months. More details here: Consumer price inflation basket of goods and services: 2017 Oh wow. Charlotte Hogg actually offered to resign last week, when she also admitted to MPs that she\u2019s failed to report her brother\u2019s role at Barclays. The Bank has just published Hogg\u2019s resignation letter, in which she insists she made an \u201chonest mistake\u201d by not fully complying with the BoE\u2019s code of conduct (which she helped to draw up). She also reiterates that she never shared any information with her brother , but recognises that saying sorry isn\u2019t enough. Here\u2019s the letter, dated yesterday (suggesting she resigned last night, after MPs met to discuss the issue before drawing up this morning\u2019s report). Labour MP Angela Eagle says Hogg has made the right decision: Here\u2019s some instant reaction to Charlotte Hogg\u2019s resignation, from the BBC\u2019s business editor Kamal Ahmed: And here\u2019s our political editor Heather Stewart: NEWSFLASH: Charlotte Hogg has resigned from the Bank of England, following the scathing report from the Treasury committee. In a statement, the BoE says it accepted her resignation with deep regret. Anthony Habgood, Chair of Court, says: \u201cIn her time at the Bank, Charlotte Hogg has made a huge contribution in areas such as professionalising and modernising the management and operations of the Bank, leading the implementation of the strategic plan, championing diversity and driving forward the Bank\u2019s understanding of key issues such as Fintech and Operational Risk. No one who knows her doubts her track record or her integrity. While Charlotte\u2019s decision by any measure exceeds the standard that would be expected in the private sector or would be required under statute, it is understandable in the circumstances and she has taken it with the best interests of the Bank at heart.\u201d Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank, says he also \u201cdeeply regrets\u201d her decision: \u201cWhile I fully respect her decision taken in accordance with her view of what was the best for this institution, I deeply regret that Charlotte Hogg has chosen to resign from the Bank of England.\u201d \u201cSince Charlotte joined the Bank almost four years ago, she has transformed its management and operations. Drawing on her extensive private sector experience and her unrelenting commitment to excellence, she has led a broad range of initiatives to build a more open and inclusive institution, to overhaul our IT systems, and to change fundamentally how the Bank develops, manages and rewards its dedicated public servants. Along the way, she has inspired countless colleagues at the Bank and attracted a new cohort of professionals to it. The combination of Charlotte\u2019s unique skills and drive were exceptionally well suited to lead similar transformations of our markets and banking responsibilities, particularly given the growing importance of FinTech, operational excellence and the management of cyber risk.\u201d Charlotte Hogg is under serious pressure now, following the Treasury Committee\u2019s ruling that she lacks the competence to be deputy governor. Wes Streeting, another member of the committee, says she should step down. Newsflash: The Treasury Committee has just declared that Charlotte Hogg, the new deputy governor of the Bank of England, has fallen short of the \u2018highest standards\u2019 required for the role. In a new report, MPs have criticised Hogg for not reporting that her brother Quintin works for Barclays, when she joined the Bank in 2013 as chief operating officer. Hogg only revealed this breach of the code of conduct last week, having initially told the committee that she had reported all possible conflicts of interest. And the Treasury Committee has now concluded that this means Hogg is not up to the job of deputy governor \u2013 a very serious rebuke. Here\u2019s the key conclusion from its report: In its Report on 2 March, the Committee concluded that Ms Hogg had the professional competence necessary to fulfil the role of Deputy Governor for Markets and Banking. Had it known then what has since been disclosed, it would have taken a different view. Professional competence for this role includes an ability to follow the rules, particularly those that one has had a hand in writing and enforcing; an understanding of why those rules are important; and an awareness of the risks arising from actual and potential conflicts of interest, and the perceptions of conflict. Ms Hogg\u2019s oral and written evidence has given the Committee grounds for concern on all three counts. The Committee considers that her professional competence falls short of the very high standards required to fulfil the additional responsibilities of Deputy Governor for Markets and Banking. John Mann MP, a member of the committee, says this is its strongest ever ruling. The British Chambers of Commerce has added to the jitters in the City this morning. Although the BCC has raised its growth forecast for 2017, it also cut its forecasts for 2018 and predicted that consumer spending will falter as inflation rises. More here: Foreign exchange traders are starting to get \u201cspooked\u201d by the prospect of two years of Brexit negotiations, warns Kathleen Brooks of City Index. Parliament may have passed the Brexit Bill, but a source at the PM\u2019s office said that Article 50 won\u2019t be triggered today, instead we will have to wait until the end of March, when Dutch elections and the EU\u2019s 60th birthday celebrations are out of the way. The pound has taken a sharp drop in early Tuesday trading, in fairness liquidity has been thin, however, it suggests that the reality of the UK\u2019s divorce from Europe and two years of horse-trading to agree trade deals is beginning to spook the FX market. Naeem Aslam of Think Markets says \u201csterling has dropped like a rock\u201d this morning, as traders wake up to the reality that the UK will trigger article 50 this month. Theresa May is heading towards hard Brexit negotiations with an attitude that she has nothing to lose. The biggest fear on the street is what will her EU partners will say and how they are going to treat this matter given that Brexit is about to become a reality. Britain\u2019s FTSE 250 index, which contains many medium-sized UK companies, hit a fresh all-time high in early trading. A cheaper pound boosts the value of UK companies\u2019 overseas earnings, and also makes them more vulnerable to takeover bids from foreign rivals. Financial experts believe that Scotland\u2019s push for a new referendum on independence is also hitting the pound today. Theresa May tried to slap down the idea yesterday, claiming the Scottish Government was playing politics by requesting a second vote. But the City is concerned that the United Kingdom\u2019s future is also in doubt, as the PM starts the devilishly complicated task of exiting the EU. Investors must consider whether the vote will happen, whether it will be before or after Brexit, and what the result might be. Carsten Nickel of Teneo Intelligence says: The many questions surrounding the latest Scottish push for independence will further add to the already elevated levels of uncertainty. The coming days will likely see both pro- and anti-independence activists starting to work with strong assumptions about the consequences of a potential Scottish break-away, painting their positive or negative views as \u201cinevitable\u201d. Here\u2019s Adam Cole of Royal Bank of Canada: The government\u2019s stance on calls for a second Scottish referendum is still evolving, but reports in the media overnight (The Times) suggest PM May is \u201cpreparing to reject\u201d the call. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets agrees that the prospect of a second Scottish independence vote is pushing sterling down this morning. The prospect of Britain triggering its exit from the European Union this month has hit sterling this morning. The pound has shed almost a cent against the US dollar in early trading, hitting $1.2125. That\u2019s sterling\u2019s lowest point since mid-January, when Theresa May declared that Britain would leave the single market. It\u2019s around 19% weaker than before last June\u2019s Brexit vote. The pound is also down around 0.6% against the euro, at \u20ac1.140. Traders appear to be responding to last night\u2019s developments in Westminster, where MPs gave their approval to Theresa May\u2019s Brexit bill. That gives the prime minister the power to formally trigger article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, and ends the tussle between the House of Commons and the House of Lords. The Lords had pushed, in vain, for the government to grant residency rights to EU nationals and guarantee MPs a vote on the final Brexit deal. Labour\u2019s leader in the Lords, Lady Smith, told the Guardian that the Upper House realised there was no hope of changing MPs minds over this issue. She said: \u201cIf I thought there was a foot in the door or a glimmer of hope that we could change this bill, I would fight it tooth and nail, but it doesn\u2019t seem to be the case. Brexit won\u2019t be formally triggered today, but the government is adamant it will happen by the end of the month. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. America\u2019s central bank begins its two-day policy meeting today, where policymakers are widely expected to raise borrowing costs for the first time this year. The Federal Reserve meeting is taking place in a chilly New York, as a blizzard strikes the North East of America. That may prevent some Wall Street traders getting to work, but it shouldn\u2019t prevent the Fed taking its decisions or holding a press conference tomorrow night. Investors will be keen to see how hawkish Fed chair Janet Yellen sounds, for clues on how many interest rates may come this year. In the UK, we\u2019re about to find out which products have been added to the basket of goods used to calculate inflation, and which have been turfed out. The ONS will reveal all at 9.30am GMT. In Europe, the Dutch election race is reaching a climax. Voters head to the polls tomorrow, after watching prime minister Mark Rutte and far-right populist Geert Wilders clash in a TV debate last night. The escalating row between the Netherlands and Turkey, following a ban on Turkish ministers campaigning in the country, has added an extra level of tension and drama and put migration firmly in the spotlight (just where Wilders wants it). And in the City, online supermarket chain Ocado and copper producer Antofagasta are reporting results. We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day....",

This would lead to a one-off increase of around 8% of GDP in the UK gross public debt ratio as Scotland dropped out of UK GDP, on the basis of latest estimates of UK and Scottish GDP.</p> <p>At the same time, we would assume that Scotland would be responsible for a proportionate share of existing public debt in the form of a long-term bilateral loan, giving the UK an off-setting claim on Scotland. This UK asset would be taken into account in our judgement of the overall position and sustainability of the UK\u2019s public finances.</p> <p>We recognise that a wide range of outcomes from Brexit is possible and we will continue to assess the UK sovereign rating as developments unfold. The Negative Outlook on the UK\u2019s \u2018AA\u2019 sovereign rating reflects the heightened uncertainty following the Brexit vote and the long-term challenge for the UK to reduce public debt.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-03-14T16:49:36.134Z\">at 4.49pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-58c81b0be4b00bd41ba51d9b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-03-14T16:40:23.675Z\">4.40pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Ahead of this week\u2019s meeting of G20 finance ministers in Baden-Baden, the International Monetary Fund has called on the major economies to preserve the benefits of trade and avoid protectionism.</strong></p> <p>With US president Trump showing protectionist tendencies and a propensity to rip up trade agreements, the IMF called for countries with trade and current account surpluses to work with countries with deficits to reduce these imbalances.</p> <p>IMF managing director Christine Lagarde said the global economy was improving but \u201cit would be a mistake to assume that it will automatically return to rude health.\u201d She added:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In fact, there has rarely been a period when policy choices have mattered more for what comes next, especially since there are still considerable risks to the outlook...</p> <p>Above all, we should collectively avoid self-inflicted injuries.

Among other things, short-covering was the reason behind the slightly firmer oil prices then.

The latest drop was apparently in response to the OPEC\u2019s monthly oil report. While the OPEC acknowledged that compliance with the supply adjustments by OPEC and some non-OPEC producers supported prices and it raised its global oil demand forecast for 2017, it also raised its estimates for oil production from outside of the cartel. In the US, shale producers have ramped up drilling activity and increased oil output in response to higher prices.

      "bodyText": "If you are the chief executive of a FTSE 100 company, and thus the recipient once a year of oodles of share-based incentives worth several times your \u00a31m-ish salary, the quickest way to get seriously rich is as follows. First, trash your price. Second, wait for your incentive shares to be awarded at the bottom of the market. Third, lead the glorious recovery. Even if you succeed only in getting the share price back to the original starting point, a V-shaped journey is much more lucrative than going sideways in boring fashion. You will collect a windfall gain. Long-term shareholders will just hold an asset restored to its former value. There is no suggestion that Mark Cutifani, chief executive of Anglo American, has used sleight of hand to manufacture a windfall gain for himself. Indeed, it would be impossible to do so. Anglo\u2019s share price, as with all the big miners, is blown about by forces beyond its control \u2013 such as the prices of iron ore, coal and copper. The point, though, is that the V-shaped passage of Anglo\u2019s share price in the past two years has boosted the value of Cutifani\u2019s share awards in a manner that seems perverse. Anglo was worst performing FTSE 100 stock in 2015 but became the best performing in 2016 as commodity breezes changed direction violently. It was Cutifani\u2019s good luck to be awarded his shares at the right moment. He got his stock at 444p a year ago when the award was worth \u00a34.4m. Now, after the return of the share price to \u00a311.84, that package is worth almost \u00a312m. That is after only one lap of the track and via a scheme that is supposed to measure \u201clong-term\u201d performance. Cutifani may be doing an excellent job, but common sense says the size of his likely windfall owes more to timing than to personal brilliance. Remembering last year\u2019s 42% shareholder rebellion over precisely this possibility of a windfall gain, Anglo\u2019s remuneration chair Sir Philip Hampton proposes a few tweaks to address what he calls \u201cthe issue of volatility\u201d. Cutifani\u2019s combined payout from his incentive awards for 2014, 2015 and 2016 will be capped at \u00a313.1m and maximums will also be placed on future awards. That is logical as far it goes, but surely Hampton has missed the main point. Luck and timing are baked into long-term incentive schemes, or Ltips. That is especially true in a feast-or-famine business like mining. Extending holding periods, and similar fiddles, can reduce the problem but the structure remains a mathematical nonsense. That is one reason why a few enlightened fund managers would be happy to abolish Ltips altogether and accept that executives\u2019 basic salaries might increase as a result. Reform should be encouraged. Ltips \u2013 the biggest single driver of inflation in boardroom pay over the past two decades \u2013 have had their day. They are too complicated and, as Anglo has demonstrated, external factors can generate life-changing sums. Bring on simpler pay schemes. Wood Group\u2019s Amec takeover makes sense When a \u00a33.3bn company splashes out \u00a31.9bn on a \u201ctransformational\u201d acquisition, paying half in shares and half in cash, what do you get three years later? The answer, in the case of Amec, which spent the sum on US group Foster Wheeler in 2014, is a pile of trouble, towering debts followed by submission to Wood Group\u2019s all-share takeover offer at only \u00a32.2bn. Amec Foster Wheeler can claim that its share price, at 546p, looks healthier than the sub-400p seen a year ago when long-serving chief executive Samir Brikho departed. All the same, Amec\u2019s shares hit \u00a312 in 2014 before Brikho set his eyes on Foster Wheeler, a bigger deal than he had attempted in the past. The purchase took Amec into unfamiliar downstream parts of the oil and gas industry and, more importantly, saddled it with \u00a31bn of debt just as the commodity prices fell. If Wood Group had not turned up, Amec would be hitting its shareholders with a \u00a3500m rights issue. Against that unlovely prospect, the all-share takeover makes sense. Wood reckons it can find \u00a3110m of annual cost savings for an upfront cost of \u00a3190m spread over the first three years of ownership. That is a decent payback. The purchase is still a big adventure for Aberdeen-based Wood but its reputation for solidity and conservatism is better than Amec\u2019s ever was. All the same, you\u2019d expect Ian Marchant, chairman of Wood, to have read his Amec history and avoided using the dreaded \u201ctransformational\u201d word to describe Monday\u2019s deal.

It is best known for treating celebrities, particularly for drug addiction, and has been described as the British equivalent of the Betty Ford Clinic in the US. The list of well-known patients includes songwriter Pete Doherty, former footballer Paul Gascoigne and Lloyds Banking Group chief executive Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio. The Priory treats a wide range of mental health problems including depression, anxiety and addictions. Some of the facilities on offer to private patients include an on-site restaurant, a gym with a personal trainer and housekeeping for a number of the private en suite rooms. But the Care Quality Commission (CQC) gave the hospital a rating of \u201crequires improvement\u201d following an inspection. The regulator issued the provider with a warning notice after inspectors rated the hospital as \u201cinadequate\u201d for providing safe care. But Priory Healthcare, which runs the hospital, said it was \u201cdisappointed\u201d the regulator decided to reinspect its facility in the middle of a \u00a31.2m improvement programme. The CQC argued that the hospital was not providing safe levels of staffing to meet the needs of their patients. The inspection report reads: \u201cThere remained high vacancy rates for nurses across the hospital and particularly on the eating disorder service. This resulted in high use of bank and agency staff and there were also a significant number of shifts with below safe staffing levels. \u201cRecords indicated that there were more incidents on shifts with insufficient staff on Priory Court, the eating disorders unit for children and adolescents. There had been 95 incidents on Priory Court in the six months prior to the inspection. \u201cFollowing the inspection the provider sent us revised figures indicating a higher level of staffing than indicated at the time of the inspection. We undertook enforcement action against the provider, serving a warning notice regarding staffing levels.\u201d The regulator launched a reinspection of the premises in October last year after it highlighted concerns during a visit in March 2016. It said that in addition to concerns about staffing levels, inspectors concluded that the hospital environment, particularly on the acute wards, remained unsafe for patients at risk of suicide or self-harm. Inspectors rated the trust as \u201cgood\u201d for being effective and caring but \u201crequires improvement\u201d on being responsive. Dr Paul Lelliott, the CQC\u2019s deputy chief inspector for mental health, said: \u201cWhen we inspected the Priory hospital in October 2016, we were very concerned about the safety of patients at risk of suicide or self-harm. \u201cThe hospital must ensure it can meet the needs of patients they choose to admit whilst improvements to staffing and the environment take place. \u201cWe did however find some improvements and noted that the provider had implemented a pre-admission risk assessment. \u201cThe wards also provided a comprehensive range of psychological therapies, including dialectical behavioural therapy, mindfulness, and family therapy. Occupational therapists and dietitians facilitated activities and discussion groups.\u201d Commenting on the inspection, Dr Sylvia Tang, chief executive of Priory Healthcare, said: \u201cRoehampton is a safe hospital providing high quality care and treatment and we remain fully committed to making improvements for the benefit of all of our patients. \u201cOur \u00a31.2m improvement programme at Roehampton is being led by a new management team and includes trialling a state-of-the-art patient monitoring system. \u201cIt is disappointing that we have been reinspected part way through this programme when there were works in progress which have now been completed. \u201cSimilarly, we question CQC\u2019s findings in relation to staffing: our rotas show that appropriate staff-patient ratios have been maintained and, over the last year, we have reduced the vacancy rate for nurses by more than 50%, despite a national shortage of nurses.\u201d In the UK, the Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123. In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Hotline is 1-800-273-8255. In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is on 13 11 14.",

      "bodyText": "Charlotte Hogg had to go. If you work in one of the top jobs at the Bank of England and MPs say your professional competence falls short of the highest standards required, you are toast. She jumped before she was pushed. The report from the Treasury select committee that sent Hogg on her way could hardly have been more damning about her failure to disclose the fact her brother worked for Barclays \u2013 a bank regulated and supervised by Threadneedle Street. There was no evidence, according to the committee, that Hogg deliberately concealed her brother\u2019s role from the Bank. Nor was there any evidence that any conflict of interest had arisen to date. MPs accepted Hogg\u2019s assurance that she and her brother exchanged gossip about their children rather than juicy, commercially sensitive information. But that was the extent of the good news. The Treasury committee found four key reasons for criticising the woman who has now stepped down as the Bank\u2019s deputy governor and chief operating officer. First, she had failed to comply with the code of conduct for nearly four years despite plenty of procedural reminders that she had to do so. Second, she had been responsible for drafting and implementing the code, which was intended to show the Bank would adhere to standards of corporate governance at least as high as the institutions it was overseeing. Third, the committee was irked by Hogg\u2019s failure to recognise the seriousness of her breach during a period when her brother had a senior position at Barclays. Finally, and most crucially, the committee did not accept Hogg\u2019s conclusion in a letter to the committee that she did not anticipate any actual or potential conflict of interest arising in the future. MPs thought otherwise and said Hogg\u2019s conclusion was a \u201cserious error of judgment\u201d. In theory, the Treasury committee has only an advisory role when it comes to appointments to the Bank of England, but in this case the strongly worded condemnation of Hogg\u2019s behaviour made her position untenable. That\u2019s despite the fact that she was handpicked by Mark Carney in one of his first appointments after becoming governor in 2013 and was one of his most trusted lieutenants. Carney regrets Hogg\u2019s departure but was unable to prevent it. Hogg has done the right thing in resigning quickly. Better that than a long, drawn-out process that would eventually have ended with the same result. She was damaged goods. This incident shows that the system of oversight by the Treasury committee has worked. The grilling of Anthony Habgood, chairman of the Bank of England court, was forensic and showed MPs at their best. As the report noted, Hogg\u2019s departure raises wider concerns. The fact that Habgood had no inkling of Hogg\u2019s failure to disclose her brother\u2019s job suggests the Bank\u2019s governance is not all it should have been. Perhaps the most troubling aspect of the whole affair is that Habgood seemed to assume that because Hogg was an all-round good egg from a distinguished family he didn\u2019t need to ask too many questions.",

    "webTitle": "UK economy will grow more strongly than expected, says BCC", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Robust consumer spending and a brighter outlook for trade and investment will mean the UK\u2019s economic slowdown this year is less severe than previously feared, the British Chambers of Commerce has predicted. But in its latest set of economic forecasts, published as the UK prepares to embark on Brexit negotiations, the business group cut its outlook for 2018 and warned higher inflation would take a chunk out of household budgets. The BCC joined other bodies in raising its outlook for the UK\u2019s GDP growth this year after a stronger-than-expected close to 2016 and signs of resilience to the Brexit vote among businesses and consumers. But it remains more pessimistic than other forecasters such as the Bank of England and the International Monetary Fund. The BCC is now forecasting that after expanding 1.8% in 2016, the UK economy will grow 1.4% in 2017. That is faster than its forecast made in December for 1.1% growth this year. It said the upgrade reflected a strong finish to 2016 for UK growth, higher than expected levels of consumer spending and a slight improvement in the outlook for investment and trade. But the group nudged down its expectations for 2018 from 1.4% to 1.3%, and published its first forecast for 2019 for 1.5% growth. It noted that if growth panned out as forecast it would be well below the long-term average. \u201cThanks to the hard work of businesses and the continued resilience of the redoubtable British consumer, the UK economy is likely to grow somewhat more strongly than we\u2019d previously expected during 2017,\u201d said BCC director general Adam Marshall. \u201cYet with several years of unspectacular growth ahead, coupled with inflationary pressures and the uncertain outcome of Brexit negotiations, it has never been more important to tackle the longstanding constraints that limit business confidence and growth here at home.\u201d He described last week\u2019s maiden budget from chancellor Philip Hammond as a \u201cmissed opportunity\u201d for the government to do more on infrastructure improvements, on support for international trade, and to lower upfront taxes and costs on businesses. \u201cMore thoughtful and radical moves to improve the business environment would give businesses \u2013 and GDP forecasts \u2013 a boost during a critical and complex time,\u201d said Marshall. A number of forecasters have raised their outlook UK growth for this year, notably: The Bank of England now forecasts 2.0% up from the 1.4% it said in November The Office for Budget Responsibility now forecasts 2.0% vs 1.4% in November The OECD now forecasts 1.6% vs 1.2% in November The International Monetary Fund forecasts 1.5% vs 1.1% in October The thintank NIESR forecasts 1.7% vs 1.4% in November But the latest CBI forecast in November was a downgrade to 1.3% growth in 2017, below the 2% forecast made last May before the Brexit vote The BCC\u2019s outlook chimed with warnings from thinktanks and anti-poverty campaigners that the pound\u2019s weakness since the Brexit vote will stoke inflation this year as it makes imports to the UK more expensive. The BCC expects inflation will rise from 1.8% on the latest figures to above the Bank of England\u2019s 2% target early this year. It predicts inflation over 2017 will be 2.4%, rising to 2.7% in 2018. That is higher than the previous forecast of 2.1% and 2.4%, respectively. Suren Thiru, the BCC\u2019s head of economics said those price pressures, coupled with lacklustre pay growth, would weigh on the UK\u2019s economic growth. \u201cThe resilience in consumer spending, a key driver of UK growth, will slowly dissipate over the coming months as higher inflation and muted wage growth combine to erode consumer spending power,\u201d said Thiru. The upside to the weak pound for the economy would be some support for exports, he added. Sterling\u2019s sharp depreciation since the referendum has helped make UK goods cheaper in overseas markets and there has been some evidence that exports have picked up as a result. But trade was a smaller contributor to the UK economy than consumer spending, Thiru noted, and so the pound effect on exports would have a limited impact on headline growth. A separate report into the UK\u2019s jobs market was similarly cautious about the economic outlook. Recruitment agency ManpowerGroup said business hiring had dropped to its weakest level for three years. Its survey, based on responses from 2,119 UK employers, found hiring confidence had fallen sharply in London and Scotland, the two strongest remain-supporting regions of the UK. Manpower\u2019s overall net employment outlook, covering the private and public sectors, dropped to +5% from +7% three months ago, showing there were still slightly more employers who planned to hire staff than cut them. Mark Cahill, ManpowerGroup UK managing director, said: \u201cThe impending trigger of article 50 is clearly affecting confidence in the job market. \u201cThe employment rate is at its highest level since records began in 1971, but if you lift the bonnet to look at the engine of the economy, job creation has slowed and employers are becoming more cautious. The companies which have powered Britain\u2019s economy through the immediate post-referendum period are easing off the gas.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Robust consumer spending and a brighter outlook for trade and investment will mean the UK\u2019s economic slowdown this year is less severe than previously feared, the British Chambers of Commerce has predicted.</p> <p>But in its latest set of economic forecasts, published as the UK prepares to embark on Brexit negotiations, the business group cut its outlook for 2018 and warned higher inflation would take a chunk out of household budgets.</p> <p>The BCC joined other bodies in raising its outlook for the UK\u2019s GDP growth this year after a stronger-than-expected close to 2016 and signs of resilience to the Brexit vote among businesses and consumers. But it remains more pessimistic than other forecasters such as the Bank of England and the International Monetary Fund.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/05/uk-economy-ends-2016-on-high-but-rising-import-prices-bite\">UK economy ends 2016 on high \u2013 but rising import prices starting to bite</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The BCC is now forecasting that after expanding 1.8% in 2016, the UK economy will grow 1.4% in 2017. That is faster than its forecast made in December for 1.1% growth this year. <br></p> <p>It said the upgrade reflected a strong finish to 2016 for UK growth, higher than expected levels of consumer spending and a slight improvement in the outlook for investment and trade.</p> <p>But the group nudged down its expectations for 2018 from 1.4% to 1.3%, and published its first forecast for 2019 for 1.5% growth. It noted that if growth panned out as forecast it would be well below the long-term average.</p> <p>\u201cThanks to the hard work of businesses and the continued resilience of the redoubtable British consumer, the UK economy is likely to grow somewhat more strongly than we\u2019d previously expected during 2017,\u201d said BCC director general Adam Marshall.</p> <p>\u201cYet with several years of unspectacular growth ahead, coupled with inflationary pressures and the uncertain outcome of Brexit negotiations, it has never been more important to tackle the longstanding constraints that limit business confidence and growth here at home.\u201d<br></p> <p>He described <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/mar/08/philip-hammond-economy-budget-2017-chancellor-growth-brexit\">last week\u2019s maiden budget from chancellor Philip Hammond</a> as a \u201cmissed opportunity\u201d for the government to do more on infrastructure improvements, on support for international trade, and to lower upfront taxes and costs on businesses.</p> <p>\u201cMore thoughtful and radical moves to improve the business environment would give businesses \u2013 and GDP forecasts \u2013 a boost during a critical and complex time,\u201d said Marshall.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/mar/2017-03-13T18:11:57/embed.html\" data-alt=\"UK growth forecasts\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/mar/2017-03-13T18:11:57/embed.html\">UK growth forecasts</a> </figure>  <p>A number of forecasters have raised their outlook UK growth for this year, notably:<br></p> <ul> <li>The Bank of England <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/feb/02/bank-of-england-uk-growth-forecast-economy-brexit\">now forecasts 2.0%</a> up from the 1.4% it said in November</li> <li>The Office for Budget Responsibility <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/mar/08/uk-economy-will-grow-2-this-year-but-slow-next-obr-predicts\">now forecasts 2.0%</a> vs 1.4% in November</li> <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/mar/07/budget-2017-philip-hammond-oecd-upgrades-uk-growth\">The OECD now forecasts 1.6%</a> vs 1.2% in November</li> <li>The International Monetary Fund <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/16/imf-trump-protectionism-world-economy-trade-us-europe\">forecasts 1.5%</a> vs 1.1% in October</li> <li>The thintank NIESR <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/feb/01/uk-growth-forecast-upgraded-inflation-niesr-brexit\">forecasts 1.7%</a> vs 1.4% in November</li> <li>But the latest <a href=\"http://www.cbi.org.uk/news/economic-forecast-unchanged-for-2016-but-slower-growth-predicted-over-next-two-years/\">CBI forecast in November</a> was a downgrade to 1.3% growth in 2017, below the 2% forecast made last May before the Brexit vote</li> </ul> <p>The BCC\u2019s outlook chimed with warnings from thinktanks and anti-poverty campaigners that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/mar/09/uk-pay-growth-budget-resolution-foundation\">the pound\u2019s weakness since the Brexit vote will stoke inflation this year</a> as it makes imports to the UK more expensive.</p> <p>The BCC expects inflation will rise from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/feb/14/uk-inflation-rises-to-18-spurred-by-weak-pound-and-rising-fuel-costs\">1.8% on the latest figures</a> to above the Bank of England\u2019s 2% target early this year. It predicts inflation over 2017 will be 2.4%, rising to 2.7% in 2018. That is higher than the previous forecast of 2.1% and 2.4%, respectively.</p> <p>Suren Thiru, the BCC\u2019s head of economics said those price pressures, coupled with lacklustre pay growth, would weigh on the UK\u2019s economic growth.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/12/uk-economy-near-standstill-brexit-vote-hits-investment-bcc\">UK economy to hit near standstill as Brexit vote hurts investment \u2013 BCC</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe resilience in consumer spending, a key driver of UK growth, will slowly dissipate over the coming months as higher inflation and muted wage growth combine to erode consumer spending power,\u201d said Thiru.<br></p> <p>The upside to the weak pound for the economy would be some support for exports, he added. Sterling\u2019s sharp depreciation since the referendum has helped make UK goods cheaper in overseas markets and there has been some evidence that exports have picked up as a result.</p> <p>But trade was a smaller contributor to the UK economy than consumer spending, Thiru noted, and so the pound effect on exports would have a limited impact on headline growth.</p> <p>A separate report into the UK\u2019s jobs market was similarly cautious about the economic outlook. Recruitment agency ManpowerGroup said business hiring had dropped to its weakest level for three years.</p> <p>Its survey, based on responses from 2,119 UK employers, found hiring confidence had fallen sharply in London and Scotland, the two strongest remain-supporting regions of the UK. Manpower\u2019s overall net employment outlook, covering the private and public sectors, dropped to +5% from +7% three months ago, showing there were still slightly more employers who planned to hire staff than cut them.</p> <p>Mark Cahill, ManpowerGroup UK managing director, said: \u201cThe impending trigger of article 50 is clearly affecting confidence in the job market.</p> <p>\u201cThe employment rate is at its highest level since records began in 1971, but if you lift the bonnet to look at the engine of the economy, job creation has slowed and employers are becoming more cautious. The companies which have powered Britain\u2019s economy through the immediate post-referendum period are easing off the gas.\u201d</p>",
