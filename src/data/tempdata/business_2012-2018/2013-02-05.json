The boss of the investment bank, John Hourican, is expected to step aside to be accountable, if not responsible, for the rigging of the benchmark rate. With the fine expected to be announced on Wednesday, the business secretary, Vince Cable, raised the question of the future ownership of RBS. Cable was an advocate for the full nationalisation of RBS during the 2008 crisis and has also backed plans for a mutualisation. The Conservative peer and former chancellor Lord Lawson, a member of the banking commission, has recently renewed calls for full state control.

      "bodyText": "Virgin Media, against many expectations, has triumphed in its struggle against debt. In 2011, its borrowings were deemed worthy of investment grade \u2013 a first in a UK cable industry that for a decade and a half, during its troubled incarnation as Telewest and NTL, was a byword for junk. So, with financial sobriety achieved and borrowings now down to \u00a35bn-ish, it must be time to reload with debt and crank up the leverage, right? That does indeed seem to be thinking behind Liberty Global's bid approach. There are few operational savings to be bagged by combining Virgin Media with Liberty's cable businesses in continental Europe. Instead, Liberty's John Malone seems to be making a pure assessment of Virgin's future cashflows and calculating the price at which he could refinance the business in this sudden new era of cheap and plentiful credit for leveraged buy-outs. City analysts, second guessing Malone's appetite, reckon he might be willing to pay 7.5 times ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) with borrowings being used to pay two-thirds of the takeover bill. That would imply a take-out price for Virgin Media's Nasdaq-listed shares of $47 (\u00a330) apiece. Not bad for stock trading at $5 during the depths of the credit crunch in early 2009, when chief executive Neil Berkett's comment that he had inherited a financial basket-case was fresh in memories. Berkett got over the refinancing humps and the rest of the story has been about improving customer service (not hard given cable's past reputation; still more to do, some customers may feel), investing in fast broadband and avoiding too many head-to-head confrontations with BSkyB and BT. Sensible strategy. Berkett's personal windfall, via the usual share-based incentive schemes, could be close to $30m. That's the reward for success when the odds are long. Another to look at events is that, thanks to wonders of central bank's ultra-loose monetary policy, we have suddenly returned to 2006 and debt-fuelled takeover games. Virgin Media, under its own steam, would never again entertain aggressive levels of leverage. Berkett is too mindful of cable's history in Britain. Malone, on the other hand, senses an opportunity to make his long-awaited splash into the UK. Malone versus Murdoch makes for an entertaining sub-plot. In reality, the folk at BSkyB (and BT for that matter) may be inclined to laugh. They prospered when cable was swimming in debt. Now, just at the moment when Virgin Media's balance sheet is vaguely conservative, a bidder wants to make the financial stakes more exciting.",

To support this allegation, the DOJ quotes several emails that show S&amp;P fretting over losing business to Moody's.</p> <p><strong>DOJ v Wall Street: from zero to hero</strong></p> <p>This rampage is great \u2026 directionally.

You got me twisted.\" It is Patrick Dempsey growing from spindly tween idol into a silvery heartthrob.</p> <p>Considering that the DOJ is trying to regain its swagger, it seems churlish to object that it still may not be thinking big enough. And yet \u2026</p> <p>The DOJ's approach is great, in theory. It's good for a prosecutor's reputation to rake one firm over the coals and humiliate it publicly. But the truth is, the effect is limited. Other firms, rather than looking at the embarrassed firm and thinking, chastened, \"there but for the grace of God go I,\" instead think, \"God, glad I'm not like that poor sucker who got caught for doing what everyone does.\"</p> <p>The DOJ is the greatest prosecutorial force in the country. It has subpoena power \u2013 excellent for commandeering embarrassing financial documents \u2013 and just enough resources and publicity power to really strike fear into Wall Street wrongdoers. The SEC is too underfunded; the CFTC has a shorter reach. The DOJ is, in short, the only entity in the country with any hope of accomplishing anything in the way of white-collar law enforcement.</p> <p><strong>Why 'making an example' doesn't work</strong></p> <p>There is some method to striking fear into the hearts of villains. For one thing, villains always believe they are exceptional. This is the case on Wall Street as well. Anyone who does anything dodgy involving money is usually pretty self-aware. He never deludes himself into thinking, \"Oh, I am not doing anything wrong.\" He thinks, instead, \"The authorities will never be smart enough to catch me.\"</p> <p>This is why singling out RBS, or UBS, or S&amp;P, will never have the fearsome deterrent effect that the DOJ really wants. In fact, by going after the firms piecemeal, the DOJ may actually be <em>encouraging</em> future wrongdoers rather than turning them away from crime.</p> <p>You see, the DOJ is going after one or two firms for actions that were widespread across the industry. Fixing interest rates was the work of thousands of people. It's safe to say that S&amp;P was not the only ratings firm that fretted that it would lose fees if it started downgrading bonds. In fact, S&amp;P, according to the emails provided by the DOJ, frequently worried that it was not keeping up with Moody's.</p> <p>This is a familiar pattern in Wall Street cases: Merrill Lynch, for instance, packaged all those bad mortgage securities partly because <a href=\"http://www.propublica.org/article/banks-self-dealing-super-charged-financial-crisis\">it was trying to outdo the profits of Goldman Sachs</a>.</p> <p><strong>Wall Street's culture of rule-breaking</strong></p> <p>The dirty secret of Wall Street is that it delights in evading rules \u2013 not just for profit, but also for sport. To keep its skills sharp. The finance industry is full of clever people who love nothing more than finding loopholes to subvert authority, whether of government or of their own head of trading. The reason Wall Street leaders are always yelling about the necessity of teamwork is because acting mostly in one's individual self-interest \u2013 and the interest of one's bonus payment \u2013 is almost always the rule.</p> <p>So, yes, this sudden burst of enthusiasm from the DOJ is a great development. There's no question that it's good, for most of the populace, to see one of America's great prosecutorial forces finally pull its act together on one of the defining scandals of our age: the greed \u2013 and sometimes fraud \u2013 that turned the housing crash into a financial crisis.</p> <p>Yes, it's late \u2013 in fact, it pushes the traditional statute of limitations on such cases \u2013 but at least, some of the gears are finally moving. \"Wisdom too often never comes, and so one ought not to reject it merely because it comes late,\" the supreme court Justice Felix Frankfurter once said, and he could have been talking about all these delayed actions.</p> <p>It's also always fun to participate in the ritual of reading the hilariously self-incriminating internal emails that the DOJ captured. One of the best includes an <a href=\"http://dealbreaker.com/2013/02/some-sp-analysts-werent-happy-with-sps-whole-trying-to-rate-deals-thing/\">S&amp;P analyst sarcastically commenting</a> that, after the crisis, the firm looked like something out of the 1980s hapless Wall Street comedy Trading Places:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"You should see how it is here. It's like a friggin trading floor. 'Downgrade, Mortimer, downgrade!'\"</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Bond ratings now less relevant</strong></p> <p>Wall Street, of course, didn't need to see these emails to see which way the wind was blowing with the ratings firms. Most banks and trading floors stopped depending on official bond ratings ages ago, even though all the ratings firms retain excellent records on corporate and municipal bonds (in fact, anything that is not mortgage-related).</p> <p>BlackRock, one of the favorite bond managers of the federal government, has boasted for years that it does its own analysis on potential defaults rather than rely on ratings firms. (BlackRock's founder, Larry Fink, was not coincidentally one of the creators of the mortgage-backed security.) Official ratings are often only a technical requirement, but rarely do many banks or investors rely on them any more \u2013 the same way those banks don't rely on the Libor interest rate any more.</p> <p>Which is why the DOJ should cast its net wider. Ultimately, the DOJ lawsuit against S&amp;P may make a splash, but it probably won't be a deterrent. The only thing that will do that is banks and investors forcing ratings firms to behave differently.</p> <p>That's easy in times of calm, like now, but much harder in bubble times, when greed rules.</p>",

You see, the DOJ is going after one or two firms for actions that were widespread across the industry. Fixing interest rates was the work of thousands of people. It's safe to say that S&amp;P was not the only ratings firm that fretted that it would lose fees if it started downgrading bonds. In fact, S&amp;P, according to the emails provided by the DOJ, frequently worried that it was not keeping up with Moody's. This is a familiar pattern in Wall Street cases: Merrill Lynch, for instance, packaged all those bad mortgage securities partly because it was trying to outdo the profits of Goldman Sachs. Wall Street's culture of rule-breaking The dirty secret of Wall Street is that it delights in evading rules \u2013 not just for profit, but also for sport. To keep its skills sharp. The finance industry is full of clever people who love nothing more than finding loopholes to subvert authority, whether of government or of their own head of trading. The reason Wall Street leaders are always yelling about the necessity of teamwork is because acting mostly in one's individual self-interest \u2013 and the interest of one's bonus payment \u2013 is almost always the rule. So, yes, this sudden burst of enthusiasm from the DOJ is a great development. There's no question that it's good, for most of the populace, to see one of America's great prosecutorial forces finally pull its act together on one of the defining scandals of our age: the greed \u2013 and sometimes fraud \u2013 that turned the housing crash into a financial crisis. Yes, it's late \u2013 in fact, it pushes the traditional statute of limitations on such cases \u2013 but at least, some of the gears are finally moving. \"Wisdom too often never comes, and so one ought not to reject it merely because it comes late,\" the supreme court Justice Felix Frankfurter once said, and he could have been talking about all these delayed actions. It's also always fun to participate in the ritual of reading the hilariously self-incriminating internal emails that the DOJ captured. One of the best includes an S&amp;P analyst sarcastically commenting that, after the crisis, the firm looked like something out of the 1980s hapless Wall Street comedy Trading Places: \"You should see how it is here. It's like a friggin trading floor. 'Downgrade, Mortimer, downgrade!'\" Bond ratings now less relevant Wall Street, of course, didn't need to see these emails to see which way the wind was blowing with the ratings firms. Most banks and trading floors stopped depending on official bond ratings ages ago, even though all the ratings firms retain excellent records on corporate and municipal bonds (in fact, anything that is not mortgage-related). BlackRock, one of the favorite bond managers of the federal government, has boasted for years that it does its own analysis on potential defaults rather than rely on ratings firms. (BlackRock's founder, Larry Fink, was not coincidentally one of the creators of the mortgage-backed security.) Official ratings are often only a technical requirement, but rarely do many banks or investors rely on them any more \u2013 the same way those banks don't rely on the Libor interest rate any more. Which is why the DOJ should cast its net wider. Ultimately, the DOJ lawsuit against S&amp;P may make a splash, but it probably won't be a deterrent. The only thing that will do that is banks and investors forcing ratings firms to behave differently. That's easy in times of calm, like now, but much harder in bubble times, when greed rules.",

Johnson, who oversaw the expansion of Pizza Express from 12 restaurants to more than 250 in the 1990s, said the classic sweets brand has \"masses of potential to grow\". Sweet sales have increased in recent years, with some analysts suggesting the recession has seen consumers wanting sweets that remind them of childhood comforts. In 2010, the US private equity firm Blackstone snapped up the UK's largest independent sweet manufacturer, Tangerine \u2013 the business behind sweets like Fruit Salads, Refreshers, Dip Dabs, American Hard Gums and Jelly Babies.

      "bodyText": "The new chief executive of Barclays has heaped further criticism on his predecessor as he pledged to \"shred\" Bob Diamond's tarnished legacy and build a \"socially useful\" bank in its place. Antony Jenkins told MPs that he would resign if another scandal on the scale of the Libor rate scam erupted during his tenure, vowing to transform a bank that he described as an aggressive and self-serving institution under its former chief executive. In an appearance at the banking standards commission, he said: \"We are shredding that legacy and in the value of stewardship, whoever is sitting in front of a committee in a decade's time \u2013 I want them to have inherited a fundamentally different culture.\" He added: \"We should shred those behaviours of the past, we should shred situations where we're short-termist, too aggressive and too self-centred. It's those things I want to eliminate from our culture.\" However, MPs and Lords on the inquiry remained unconvinced and said the company must do more to show it is changing its ways. The Committee chairman, Andrew Tyrie MP, said: \"It doesn't really matter what the scandal is \u2013 Barclays seems to have a finger in every one of those pies.\" He was also critical of Barclays' initial refusal to provide unedited information. Waving a redacted document covered in blacked-out paragraphs, he said: \"We asked for full papers and frankly it has been very hard getting them... Even the page numbers have been redacted.\" Appearing alongside Jenkins, the new Barclays chairman, Sir David Walker, agreed there must be change at the bank. But he refused to criticise his fellow board member and head of the bank's remuneration committee, Sir John Sunderland, who stunned the panel last week by saying he had no regrets over paying Diamond \u00a36.3m for 2011, including a \u00a32.7m bonus. Walker said: \"I am satisfied as of now that the present remuneration committee chairman is doing the sort of job a very good remuneration chairman should be doing. I'm not concerned about what he did in the past. [He is] performing the job we need.\" But Tyrie expressed doubts that the cultural change sought by Jenkins can be achieved by the current board. He said: \"Doesn't it seem that the time has come to set your remuneration strategy in a new framework led by a new [remuneration committee] chairman?\" The inquiry also heard that Barclays spent \u00a3100m investigating the scandal over manipulating the Libor interest rate, which determines the cost of inter-bank lending and is a key factor in setting rates that are ultimately passed on to consumers. The investigation by the UK's Financial Services Authority and US authorities led to the imposition of a \u00a3290m fine last year and the resignation of Diamond and former chairman Marcus Agius. Jenkins said he would leave if something similar happened while he is in chargeand that ignorance was not an excuse. He said: \"If there were a grave regulatory event that happened on my watch then I would feel obliged to resign. I don't think there's any doubt about that.\" However, he also revealed that he only learnt about the Libor scandal on the day it was made public in June 2012. \"I was aware there was an investigation going on around Libor, but the findings of the external investigation were only told to me on the morning of the announcement [that Barclays would be fined].\" Full turnaround plans for the bank under Jenkins will be unveiled next week, including a new five-point plan for determining bonuses, which must take into accountupholding values as well as financial performance. However, Tyrie said the commission would reserve judgement on whether Barclays has changed. Sir John Sunderland, was heavily criticised after his appearance when he said Diamond \"deserved recognition\" for what he had achieved despite the Libor and PPI misselling scandals. Tyrie said yesterday: \"We don't seem to be getting very far in thinking through how we can have confidence that the non-executives in Barclays are going to be carrying the right culture. What we want is some more concrete evidence that the board is being put in a shape that can help give you a chance of succeeding.\"",

This contact was not an Icis employee. They discussed the story including how it would be interesting to find out more about the background of Seth Freedman. No contract was entered into, nor any promise of payment given. We believe this contact has since joined Icis, but Roger Milne has had no further communication with this individual before the Guardian called Roger yesterday.\"</p> <p>Reed later said it had learned from Milne that the \"industry contact\" who spoke to him about Freedman was Street.</p> <p>Contacted by the Guardian directly, Milne said: \"I was asked by a third party just to do a tiny bit of work \u2026 I can't tell you by whom \u2026 I have not got very far and I am not going to get very far \u2026 There was absolutely no money involved.\"</p> <p>However, he said he had been \"perhaps rather stupid\".</p> <p>Freedman has previously written factual and fictionalised accounts of life in both the City and the Israeli army. The Guardian's initial report on his concerns over gas price manipulation stated that he had contributed to this paper in the past but was not working for it while employed as a price reporter for Icis. Freedman said it was \"highly stressful and frightening\" to feel he was being \"watched and investigated\".</p>",

I know a regulatory affairs bod at lcis-Heren who is keen to shed light on exactly who Freedman has been working for over the last couple of years and his exact relationship with the Guardian. \"From that you'll gather a direct approach to the Guardian wouldn't be very productive. Jolly sensitive. Icis Heren is concerned that the bod at the centre of price-rigging allegations which is being investigated by Ofgem and the FSA [Financial Services Authority] may not necessarily be the most reiliable [sic] or trustworthy of witnesses. This might seem like a bit of character assissination [sic] to the Grauniad but my Icis-Heren lot just bwant [sic] to get to tge [sic] bottom of the real Seth Freedman.\" Freedman says that it is disturbing that raising issues of public concern about the gas market has led not just to his dismissal but also to personal investigations and nasty allegations. \"Given the way I have been thus far treated by Icis, it comes as little surprise to learn that their (now) compliance officer seems to have hired an investigator to do detective work as part of what looks like a dirty tricks campaign.\" Asked about the investigation by Milne, a spokesman for Icis and Reed gave the following written statement denying there was any corporate decision to hire anyone to do detective work. He said Milne would not reveal the identity of the person \u2013 now at Icis \u2013 he had spoken to. \"Our understanding is that at the time of the original Guardian article in November about alleged price fixing in the wholesale gas market, Roger Milne, a journalist at Utility Week, was talking with an industry contact. This contact was not an Icis employee. They discussed the story including how it would be interesting to find out more about the background of Seth Freedman. No contract was entered into, nor any promise of payment given. We believe this contact has since joined Icis, but Roger Milne has had no further communication with this individual before the Guardian called Roger yesterday.\" Reed later said it had learned from Milne that the \"industry contact\" who spoke to him about Freedman was Street. Contacted by the Guardian directly, Milne said: \"I was asked by a third party just to do a tiny bit of work \u2026 I can't tell you by whom \u2026 I have not got very far and I am not going to get very far \u2026 There was absolutely no money involved.\" However, he said he had been \"perhaps rather stupid\". Freedman has previously written factual and fictionalised accounts of life in both the City and the Israeli army. The Guardian's initial report on his concerns over gas price manipulation stated that he had contributed to this paper in the past but was not working for it while employed as a price reporter for Icis. Freedman said it was \"highly stressful and frightening\" to feel he was being \"watched and investigated\".",

      "bodyText": "That's all for today. Back tomorrow, when the first order of business could be the Greek government's attempts to break the ferry workers' strike (see 5.17pm). Until then, thanks and goodnight! There were more anti-corruption protests in Spain today, this time in Barcelona, with demonstrators calling for prime minister Mariano Rajoy to step down. Here are some photos of the demo, outside the Catalan parliament. Another reason for the market recovery today, and the rally in Spanish debt, is that it may be hard to eject Mariano Rajoy from office even if he is guilty of taking illegal payments. The wheels of justice turn slowly in Spain, experts say. Magistrates can spend years examining a case, and might leave their post before the work is done - forcing the next guy to plod through it all again. That's why some Madrid insiders reckon Rajoy is safe. Reuters reports: A member of parliament for Rajoy's Popular Party summed up a sanguine mood in the PP, voicing confidence delays would stifle the problem: \"Beyond all the political noise, I don't think this will cause instability for the government or the party,\" he said. \"It's an issue that won't have any quick conclusion. Investment analyst Alastair Newton at Nomura in London also saw little urgent threat to government stability. \"Furthermore,\" he wrote in a research note on Tuesday, \"If Spanish prosecutors were to decide that there is a case to answer, it is likely to take some years to prove, or otherwise, any wrongdoing.\" Fernando Jimenez a political scientist and corruption expert at the University of Murcia, noted dozens of corruption cases involving all major parties had been dragging through the courts for years: \"Everyone knows there are very few convictions in corruption cases, so you get this sense of impunity,\" he said. A healthier day for Europe's stock markets, after yesterday's tumbles. Here's the closing prices. FTSE 100: up 35 points at 6282, +0.58% German DAX: up 26 points at 7664, + 0.35% French CAC: up 34 points at 3694, +0.95% Spanish IBEX: up 174 points at 8093, + 2.2% Italian FTSE MIB: up 173 points at 16712, +1.05% That follows this morning's economic data, showing that the eurozone (see 9.12am onwards) and UK (9.49am) economies performed stronger than expected. It also comes after decent financial months, as Adam Seagrave, equity trader at Saxo, explains: UK stocks rebounded from yesterday\u2019s move down (the biggest in almost 3 months) as ARM Holdings and BP beat analysts\u2019 expectations on earnings. ARM, whose microchip helps power Apple\u2019s iPhone, rallied to a 12 year high after reporting a 19% increase in Q4 revenue whilst BP\u2019s shares were seen trading as high as \u00a34.7175, following adjusted profits that beat the market\u2019s expectations. These UK corporate earnings are set against the backdrop of the US earnings season which has seen the majority of US companies outperform expectations and pushed global equities up above their May 08 highs. Over to Greece where our correspondent Helena Smith reports the embattled government has once again resorted to mobilizing striking workers. Helena writes: First it was striking metro workers, now it is seamen. Once again, amid fears of the Greek economy being devastated by their action, the ruling coalition has made use of mobilization orders that until recently had been a measure of last resort. With the Panhellenic Union of Seamen announcing yet more strike action earlier today \u2013 grounding ships in docks for another 48 hours - the Greek government has hit back, saying as of 6 AM Wednesday protestors will be issued with mobilization papers that will give them little choice but to return to work or be fired. Addressing reporters, Kostas Mousouroulis, the merchant marine minister, said: \u201cThe government has made every possible effort to satisfy the demands of seamen. We exhausted dialogue and came up with specific solutions.\u201d Clearly exasperated he added: \u201cAs the decision of the Panhellenic Seamens\u2019 orgnanisation has shown, [a decision] that was reached by a marginal majority, petty political aims sadly leave no space for dialogue.\u201d The rolling strikes have meant that Greece\u2019s islands have been cut off from the mainland for the past six days. The prospect of ferry links and transport boats being disrupted until Friday had been described as potentially devastating for an economy utterly dependent on bailout loans from the EU and IMF. Helena adds: Island trade had been severely hit by the walk-out with local businesses, already badly affected by the financial crisis, saying they faced ruin. Seamen are up in arms over austerity measures \u2013 the price of international rescue loans \u2013 and pay arrears. Dockworkers, who had also joined the action, are similarly demanding back pay and restitution of collective work agreements that the government has been forced to abolish under pressure from international lenders. It remains to be seen how seamen - and the anti-bailout parties supporting them - will react to the government order. Tune in tomorrow morning.... Francois Hollande's plea for a 'stable' euro (translation, a weaker one) has attracted plenty of reaction this afternoon. Our economics correspondent, Phillip Inman, argues here that Hollande's comments underline how Germany's strength is hurting the rest of the eurozone: Paris, Rome and Madrid need to retain their export markets but, as Hollande's intervention shows, they are panicked that a high euro will raise costs and encourage customers to turn away. Germany, on the other hand, is thriving. In Berlin the euro is a huge benefit. It is cheaper than the Deutschmark would ever be. And small rises have so far failed to dampen the Chinese lust for high-end cars and industrial equipment. Meanwhile, sources at the European Central Bank have been briefing that the euro's recent rally is not strong enough to worry them. Sorry, Francois. Still, at least he was in demand in Strasbourg: Just in - Fitch has lowered the outlook on the Netherlands AAA rating to negative, from stable. It cited three factors - the troubled Dutch housing market, its weak banks, and the rising national debt, which at 77% of GDP looks too high for a Triple-A rating. The statement is here. And here are the three \"shocks\" which Fitch cites to justify the move: Firstly, house prices are declining at a rapid pace and the housing market correction is sharper than what the agency previously expected; Fitch has revised its projected peak-to-trough decline to 25% from 18%. This will continue to weigh heavily on household consumption and consumer confidence. Secondly, as highlighted by last week's nationalisation of SNS Bank N.V., some banking system problems persist, with three of the four major banks having faced severe financial difficulties and needing external support since 2008. Thirdly, the level of public debt (expected to peak at 77% of GDP) is higher than most 'AAA' peers, which reduces fiscal policy options, and the economy has performed worse than Fitch previously expected. But more positively, Fitch did credit the Dutch with running a \"flexible, diversified, high-value-added and competitive economy as well as its current account surpluses and positive net international investment position.\" The Re-Define think tank has published a fine research paper about banking - called How to design a good banking system? It examines through issues such as size, complexity, diversity, risk (related to liquidity, solvency, and systemic risk), before concluding: A better banking system would be simpler, safer, smaller, more diverse and more stable. And diversity, it seems, is the key. As Re-Define's Sony Kapoor concludes: Regulators would be well advised to make enhancing banking system diversity an explicit aim of regulation rather than reacting in a knee jerk manner to push for ever higher and ever more uniform bank standards and models. There is no \u2018model bank\u2019. Even if there were, a banking system comprised entirely of \u2018model banks\u2019 would be incredibly brittle and pro-cyclical and certain to fail repeatedly. We need the whole panoply of banks from the small local ones to those that occupy a sector niche to those that span borders. A diverse banking system is a good banking system. Topical, as Europe moves towards banking union. Worth a read. The yen has slid to a new two-and-a-half year low against the US dollar today. One dollar is now trading at 93.2 yen, a 1% move. The trigger for the latest weakening (which will be welcomed in the corridors of power in Tokyo) is the news that Masaaki Shirakawa is stepping down a month early as governor of the Bank of Japan, on 19 March. That, analysts believe, will speed up the process of loosening monetary policy in Japan (as part of Abenomics - the new prime minister's push to raise inflation and stimulate growth). Christopher Vecchio, currency analyst at DailyFX, reckons this means the BoJ will become more dovish, fast!: While it does not appear to be a political move that motivated Mr. Shirakawa to abandon his post \u2013 Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has been aggressive in his calls for a more sympathetic BoJ governor, but has never said he would replace Mr. Shirakawa early \u2013 it is clear that only those with the most dovish tendencies will dictate policy. \u201cThe Yen has reacted as one would expect, weakening across the board as the timeline for additional easing has been theoretically accelerated, now that Mr. Shirakawa will be \u2018out of the way\u2019 sooner rather than late. Here's an interesting graph that shows how large US companies have been running up more and more goodwill (the amount they pay in an acquisition above and beyond the face value of the company). It's doubled, on a per-share basis, over the last decade: What does that mean? One possibility is that this goodwill, currently sitting as an asset on the company's balance sheet, is going to be written off in the years ahead. Analyst Louise Cooper, of Cooper City, explains: What this chart then tells us is that in the boom years, many companies over paid for acquisitions and that they are going to have to reappraise the values of those assets. In reality, more write-downs to come, following the example of the mining sector, hurting profits. Cooper dubs this practice as \"skinny dipping\" - chasing easy profits available in the boom times rather than building solid companies. That was fuelled by central bankers' collective failure to \"take away the punch bowl just as the party gets going\" (Warren Buffett) Central bankers did not follow this advice and are now trying to medicate the aftermath with hospital strength QE painkillers. But significantly their actions are not masking the underlying hangover which is gaining momentum... There is more painful exposure to come. Perils of skinny-dipping after a night on the punch (Louise assures me!) The former treasurer of Spain's ruling People's Party (PP), Luis Barcenas, is to be questioned by the country's anti-corruption prosecutor tomorrow, over the allegations of illicit payments, according to reports from Madrid. This follows the news that the prosecutor was stepping up the investigation (see opening post). Barcenas who is accused of running a secret accounting system, was mobbed by reporters in Madrid this morning -- seeking his views on the scandal. The anti-corruption prosecutor may be harder to shake off.... Especially as El Pais says it has handed over all the so-called \"secret papers\" which appear to show the names of party officials and money they received. Spanish prime minister Mariano Rajoy, though, has repeatedly insisted that the allegations are false. The UK government has hit back at Fran\u00e7ois Hollande over the EU budget, after the French president criticised countries who want to cut spending and also keep their remit (see 11.27am). A spokesman for David Cameron told lobby hacks in Westminster today that: We are working with a number of our allies, who all believe that spending needs to come down further... If it doesn't budge, then a deal isn't going to be do-able. The next chance of a deal is the summit which begins on Thursday afternoon..... In the financial markets, shares have clawed back some of Monday's losses. Spanish government bonds are also recovering. Here's the latest: FTSE 100: up 43 points at 6290, + 0.7% German DAX: up 13 points at 7651, + 0.17% French CAC: up 37 points at 3697, + 1% Spanish IBEX: up 154 points at 8074, + 2% FTSE MIB: up 227 points at 16766, + 1.3% And Spanish 10-year bond yields are down 5 basis points, or 0.06 percentage points, at 5.4%. Traders are encouraged by this morning's economic data, suggesting the eurozone and UK are in better shape than expected. Alastair McCaig, market analyst at IG, commented: Following yesterday\u2019s broadly disappointing news flow, European markets are showing some real resilience.... Fears over Spanish political corruption and the destabilising effect it will have on its government debt, along with the pre-election soundbites coming from Italian prime minister hopeful Silvio Berlusconi, continue to hang over the eurozone. European markets however are predominantly up this morning, confirming the popularity of equity markets for investors and traders alike. French president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande has thrown down the gauntlet to the UK prime minister, David Cameron, in a speech at the European Parliament today. In his first speech as French leader to the European Parliament in Strasbourg, Hollande appeared to take a pop at Britain ahead of this week's EU summit - where leaders will again try to agree a seven-year budget. Hollande declared that: there are those who want to see cuts, others possibly the same, who want guarantees on their own rebate. And there are some who don't want the Common Agricultural Policy changed too much (although might have to swallow some cuts). Hollande insisted that leaders must make progress on the budget, saying that \"our political credibility is at stake\" otherwise. He also called for a new 'exchange rate policy\" to protect the euro from \"irrational swings\". As he put it: Europe... is leaving the euro vulnerable to irrational movements in one direction or the other. That's one problem with floating currencies, of course - made worse when you're talking about a single currency covering 17 divergent nations. As Alice Ross of the FT points out: Here are some more highlights of the Hollande speech via our Europe editor, Ian Traynor: Just when the eurozone was looking a little healthier (see this morning's PMI data), the latest retail sales data comes along... Eurozone retail sales fell by 0.8% in December on a month-on-month basis, meaning takings were 3.4% lower than a year earlier. A less festive Christmas for many Europeans, as recession, austerity and unemployment bites. Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight said the data was \"very disappointing\", adding: Furthermore, Eurozone retail sales volumes plunged 1.6% quarter-on-quarter in the fourth quarter of 2012, which reinforces suspicion that consumer spending contracted appreciably over the quarter and contributed to a third successive decline in Eurozone GDP. Over in the UK parliament, the chief executive and chairman of Barclays are being grilled by the Treasury Committee -- live stream here. Committee chairman Andrew Tyrie has been giving chairman Sir David Walker a tough time over issues such as fixed pay and bonuses. The session started well, Tyrie waving Barclay's submission to the committee - liberally smeared with black redactions. Walker conceded that the Barclays board will give \"more explicit and deliberate attention\" to issues of conduct in future. Later, Jenkins (who waived his bonus last week) told the committee that too many bad things have occurred at Barclays in the past. His goal is to stop those bad things happening and encourage more virtuous behaviour in future, he explained. In other news, Barclays has set aside another \u00a31bn to cover the cost of misselling products to its customers. Some good news for the UK \u2013 Britain's service sector grew in January, suggesting the dreaded triple-dip could be avoided. Markit (yup, them again) just reported that the UK Services PMI rose to 51.5 last month (showing it expanded), up from December's mildly contractionary 49.5. It's early days, but it suggests chancellor George Osborne may avoid presiding over another recessionary period. Markit's Chris Williamson said today's data \"greatly reduces\" the chances of GDP falling in this quarter. He added that the results would have been even better without the snow which briefly brought Britain to its knees last month. The pound has jumped on the back of the data too: And this graph from Markit shows how eurozone PMI data (the blue line) has recovered in recent months: Here's the winners and losers in today's PMI data from Markit Ireland: 54.9 2-month high - solid growth Germany: 54.4 19-month high - solid growth Spain: 46.5 19-month high - a slower contraction Italy: 45.4 2-month low - a deeper contraction France: 42.7 46-month low - the sharpest contraction since the euro crisis began Just in \u2013 new survey data suggests that the eurozone's bruised economy has turned a corner. Marki's Eurozone Composite PMI, which measures business activity across thousands of companies, hit a 10-month high of 48.6 In January, up from 47.2 in December Markit reported that businesses were more optimistic about the future. However there are sharp differences between countries. Reuters has the early details: While still signalling a contraction as the index has been below the 50 mark that signifies growth since February last year, it has risen consistently in the last three readings. Private industry makes up nearly two-thirds of the euro zone's economy and worryingly for policymakers, the data showed a widening chasm between Germany - Europe's largest economy - and France, the bloc's second biggest. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said the eurozone is showing \"clear signs of healing\", having entered recession last year, However, there were stark differences between Germany and France: Markit's composite German PMI chalked up its biggest one-month rise since August 2009, soaring to its highest since June 2011. But in neighbouring France it plummeted to its lowest in nearly four years. At 43.6, France's services PMI was even below readings from Spain and Italy. More to follow Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the eurozone financial crisis, and other key events in the world economy. The unfolding corruption allegations in Spain continue to dominate the agenda, after helping send European stock markets sliding yesterday. El Pa\u00eds, which broke the story last week, reports this morning that Spain's anti-corruption prosecutor is holding a wide-ranging investigation into claims that senior members of the ruling People's party, including prime minister Mariano Rajoy, received secret, illegal payments over many years. The prosecutor, it says, is comparing the PP's last 13 years of public accounts with the 'secret accounting system', which El Pais claims was created by treasurer Luis B\u00e1rcenas. According to El Pa\u00eds the investigation will consider whether any individuals, or the PP, committed tax fraud by not declaring secret payments, and whether limits on political donations were breached. The full story is online here in Spanish (or there's a Google translation into English here) With Rajoy insisting yesterday the allegations are untrue, the scandal could loom over the eurozone for some time. The financial markets are calmer this morning. But there's plenty of chatter about how the eurozone crisis has returned \u2013 if indeed it ever went away. I'll be tracking the latest developments in Spain, and beyond, including the latest service sector data for many European countries \u2013 and a speech by French president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain is exporting gas at a lower price than it is importing the fuel, prompting fears that household bills are being inflated. A Guardian analysis of gas flow in and out of the the UK has found that gas is frequently being piped out of Britain despite fetching a lower price abroad. It also shows that gas shipped in from Qatar regularly costs more than the gas leaving the UK. Ofgem, the energy watchdog, suggests that UK energy security is being undermined by this distortion in the market. The analysis, conducted jointly with Greenpeace, examined the gas interconnector running between the UK and Belgium. It is a major part of the UK's gas infrastructure, with the capacity to supply a fifth of the UK's gas in winter. However, on more than two-fifths of the days between December 2011 and October 2012, gas flowed the \"wrong\" way \u2013 it was exported to the continent despite the wholesale price being higher in the UK. Over the period, the UK exported 15 times more gas through the interconnector than it imported. The market distortion was worst in the coldest months, when the demand for gas is greatest: from December to February, so-called \"flows against price difference\" (FAPD) took place on three out of four days. Analysis on monthly government data from Revenue and Customs showed that from October to December 2011, the UK imported large volumes of Qatari gas despite it being up to 5% more expensive than gas exported to the continent. \"It is vital that gas on these links flows in line with market signals, to ensure security of supply for customers,\" said Ofgem, the energy market regulator. \"However, initial analysis suggests the links are not always being used efficiently. On behalf of consumers, we are looking at all the evidence to establish the facts.\" Ofgem believes FAPD means \"security of supply is undermined, since they may result in gas being exported from a market facing a shortage\". Making sure the flow of gas between the UK and the continent is \"optimised\" should reduce customer bills, according to the government, which said differences between national gas markets could cause \"imperfect price formation\". The Department of Energy and Climate Change said it \"has worked closely with our EU partners\" for \"greater ease of gas trading\" to enable \"more effective price formation, and bring price and energy security benefits for UK gas consumers\". Caroline Flint, the shadow energy secretary, said: \"Energy companies always blame wholesale gas costs on price rises, so people will not understand why we appear to be exporting cheap gas and importing expensive gas. For too long, these energy companies have been allowed to get away with running their businesses in such a complicated way that it is almost impossible for anyone to know what the true cost of energy is.\" The discovery that North Sea gas is being sold cheaply abroad puts a new spotlight on the operation of the UK's gas market, which critics describe as \"a dark and murky world\". In November, the Guardian revealed allegations of price manipulation in the wholesale gas market. Leila Dean, of Greenpeace, said: \"The gas market has once again been revealed as a dark and murky worldGeorge Osborne's dash for gas won't lower bills \u2013 it'll leave consumers even more open to exploitation.\" The cause of the FAPD in the gas market is unknown. But the FAPD have arisen since 2004 when the UK switched from being a net gas exporter to a gas importer, as North Sea production dwindled. In that time, pipelines have been opened with Norway and the Netherlands and terminals for shipped liquefied natural gas have opened, meaning the complexity of the market has increased much faster than its regulation. Ofgem, with Belgian and Dutch regulators, called for evidence on the FAPD problem in October. One explanation being considered is that some of the distortion is related to the charge levied by the National Grid for allowing a supplier to flow gas through the UK system. This may make it 0.9p a therm cheaper to export the gas abroad, rather than supply it to British customers. But the Guardian investigation showed this could not explain the abnormal gas flows on 19 days. Interconnector UK, which operates the UK-Belgian link, told Ofgem that the National Grid charge was a \"distortion to cross-border trade\" and created a \"clear export bias\" for gas. It said: \"We see this as a structural problem within the GB charging arrangements and one which Ofgem may wish to address.\" The National Grid said: \"The methodology behind the charges is consulted on by industry and ultimately approved by Ofgem.\" The charges are significant, according to Nick Campbell at the consultancy Energy Solutions: \"They are an important part of the overall price and do have an impact on the wholesale price.\" Ofgem's call for evidence identified a large number of interconnector FAPD based on an analysis of energy price data from Bloomberg. The Guardian, with Rachel Salvidge Webster at Greenpeace, analysed in greater detail price data from ICIS Heren, which the industry argues is more representative. In addition, the investigation analysed Revenue and Customs price data on imports and exports from all sources, including Qatar. Ofgem has investigated apparent gas market failures before, including FAPD on the UK-Belgian interconnector. In 2003, gas was exported through the link despite UK gas prices being \"much higher\" than on the continent. Ofgem's final report, published in 2006, was unable to determine whether European gas companies had prevented more gas flowing into the UK, due to lack of information.",

      "bodyText": "BP has been hit by a new $34bn (\u00a321.7bn) claim for alleged economic losses and punitive damages resulting from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico . The latest demand comes from local and southern state governments, including Louisiana and Mississippi, hit hard by the pollution that followed the blowout on the BP-operated Macondo well in April 2010. BP described the methodology for calculating the claims as \"seriously flawed\" and the oil company said it was confident it would not have to make additional financial provisions. BP refused to say what provisions it has already made for the $34bn claims, but admits to having taken a further $4.1bn \"charge\" in the final three months of 2012, bringing the total amount set aside so far to $42.2bn. The oil company has settled criminal charges with the US department of justice, but will suffer further financial hits as it prepares for a final civil trial scheduled to start on 26 February. Worst case scenarios could mean a further $20bn of liabilities in the event of the company being found \"grossly negligent\", but BP expects any fine to be very much smaller and is still desperately working on an out-of-court settlement to avoid the trial. The latest numbers resulting from the Deepwater disaster were released by BP on Tuesday morning as part of its fourth-quarter and full-year financial results, which showed the company had already sold $37.8bn of assets even before its sale of its half share in the Russian joint-venture TNK-BP to Rosneft. That disposal has not been completed yet, but BP's overall production \u2013 excluding TNK-BP \u2013 was down 7% in the final three months to 2.29m barrels of oil equivalents a day. The output figures were damaged by the sale of assets to pay for the Macondo blowout, and they helped drive down quarterly underlying profits by 20% in the final period, to $4bn from $5bn. The $4.1bn Deepwater charge, however, was considerably lower than analysts had forecast, and BP chief executive Bob Dudley gave an upbeat assessment of what the company had achieved. \"We have moved past many milestones in 2012, repositioning BP through divestments and bringing on new projects,\" he said. \"This lays a solid foundation for growth into the long term.\" BP said it was already in talks with Rosneft, in which it will take a 20% stake, about joint venture operations and said it could bring new technology and good governance to the Moscow-based group. Dudley would not rule out moving into the Russian Arctic with Rosneft given the scale of potential oil and gas reserves there but insisted it would treat the pristine environment \"with great sensitivity and care\". Dudley also said he did \"not rule out getting involved in UK shale\" and supported the British government strategy of looking at ways to encourage gas drilling for these more controversial resources.

Fellow miner <strong>Kazakhmys</strong>, the largest investor in ENRC with a stake of 26%, has also been tipped as a possible predator in the past, although it would need the backing of the country's government which has a 26.5% shareholding.</p> <p>With traders hearing vague suggestions of a \u00a36 a share bid, ENRC climbed 14.9p to 344.2p, a 4.5% rise making it the second best performer in the leading index. Kazakhmys meanwhile closed 2p lower at 725.5p.</p> <p>Elsewhere a surge in profits at chip designer <strong>Arm</strong> helped leading shares recover some of Monday's losses.</p> <p>The company reported a better than expected 16% rise in fourth quarter profits to \u00a380m, helped by soaring sales of tablets and smartphones. Arm's technology is used in devices ranging from Apple's iPads to Samsung's smartphones. Finance director Tim Score told Reuters:</p> <blockquote> Five years ago an Arm processor could be found in just over a quarter of devices that you could use to browse the internet. <br> In 2012, three quarters of internet connected screens and devices used an Arm processor in the main chip. </blockquote> <p>Arm's shares jumped to a 12 year high before easing back to close 39p higher at 931p. Analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch said, succinctly:</p> <blockquote> Good set of figures, solid order backlog, we love this stock.... <br> </blockquote> <p>Others were slightly less exuberant. Julian Yates at Investec has a hold recommendation:</p> <blockquote> The 2012 preliminary results highlighted many of the reasons why we are fans of Arm, but above 900p we feel many positives are factored in for now. Royalty growth is now seen 15%-20% ahead of the industry versus previous management commentary of 10%-15% - the prospect of this upside was a core driver of our previous positive stance. <br> The future prevalence of ARM designs across broader technologies (e.g. servers, networking, TVs, mobile computing) as well as smartphones is now being appreciated by the market. In our view, upgrades to long term chip shipments or royalty rates need to be factored in to take Arm to the next level. This is possible, but today's results did not yield such data points and we retain a hold. A key upside risk is that 2013 sees a licence beat based on the strong backlog. </blockquote> <p>Overall the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> finished 35.92 points better at 6282.76, after falling 100 points on Monday. Growing concerns about the political situation in the eurozone, especially in Spain and Italy, had unnerved investors after the recent market rallies, but a sense of calm seemed to return on Tuesday. Better than expected US services data helped sentiment, as did reports that President Obama was proposing a short term package to head off forthcoming US spending cuts, part of the continuing budget debate taking place in the world's largest economy. Chris Beauchamp, market analyst at IG, said:</p> <blockquote> [On Monday] there was almost a sense of panic, as it seemed the long-dormant eurozone crisis was stirring back into life. Today those fears have receded; although this is not a sign that we can once again take up an indifferent stance towards events in Spain and Italy, it does perhaps indicate how unnerved markets were. Thankfully the US is providing enough good news to offset any renewed eurozone worries, as the ISM non-manufacturing index adds to the positive picture, coming in just ahead of expectations for January. </blockquote> <p>On a busy day for corporate results, <strong>BP</strong> bounced 6.65p to 468.7p following its figures, while <strong>BG</strong> recovered from earlier falls. The gases group dropped as low as \u00a310.66 after it warned it would miss 2015 production targets. But analysts came away from a conference call in more positive moods as the company unveiled plans to make up for the output decline, including drilling wells in Egypt. It closed 38p higher at \u00a311.42.</p> <p>But <strong>Smith and Nephew</strong> headed lower after broker downgrades and fading bid hopes.</p> <p>The medical equipment lost 14p to 707.5p after Exane BNP Paribas removed it from its takeover target list. Exane said:</p> <blockquote> When we included this stock [in our merger list] in February 2011 we were confident that Johnson &amp; Johnson needed to releverage its balance sheet through an acquisition. With a 100% free float and a slightly shaky track record on execution (at the time), S&amp;N was an obvious target. In the end J&amp;J disobligingly bought Synthes instead, a family controlled Swiss company. It's a good example of the pitfalls of M&amp;A investing \u2013 you get all the reasoning right and the answer wrong. S&amp;N has performed exactly in line with the market since inclusion. </blockquote> <p>Meanwhile Panmure Gordon cut its recommendation on the company, with analyst Savvas Neophytou saying:</p> <blockquote> We remain long-term bulls of Smith &amp; Nephew but ahead of results on 7 February, we downgrade the stock to hold from buy as the current price surpassed our price target. We expect 2012 results to be largely positive but on balance of probability we cannot imagine the outlook statement will be as strong as consensus implies. The rhetoric in recent months has been one of investment and with a new finance director in place, the scene is set for clearing the decks from a financial point of view.

In a hold note on UBM, Steve Liechti of Investec said:</p> <blockquote> The good news is it is going, so management can focus on core events/PR Newswire [businesses], but the bad news is at a low price, and cash received is only \u00a3100m.

Separately management confirm an earnings per share expectation of 58p for the year - a little light to us but broadly in line with consensus. Of note, a weaker revenue performance in events, and data services missing guidance, but offset by lower corporate costs and tax. </blockquote> <p>Finally <strong>Centamin</strong> lost 1.6p to 62.55p, following Monday's rise on hopes of news that its licence to operate the Sukari mine would be validated by Egyptian authorities after recent disputes. Westhouse Securities downgrade its recommendation on Centamin following a site visit last week. Analyst Rob Broke said:</p> <blockquote> Our recent visit to Centamin's Sukari gold project in Egypt's eastern desert re-affirmed our view that Centamin is managing the operations at Sukari well, although it remains vulnerable to matters outside of its control. However, our visit reassured us that despite widely reported protests across the country, most of the violent clashes in Cairo appear to be confined to Tahir Square. <br> We retain our 65p target price, but we have downgraded our recommendation from buy to neutral following the strong upturn in the share price. Despite clear operational upside at Sukari, we believe the stock is fairly valued given the current situation in Egypt.  With the [country's] economy suffering, there is a risk that Centamin could be singled-out now that it looks set to generate significant revenues. </blockquote>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain's dominant services sector returned to growth last month, raising hopes the UK could narrowly avoid a triple-dip recession. The monthly health check of services \u2013 which spans everything from banking to hotels, and accounts for around 75% of Britain's total economic output \u2013 showed the sector growing at its fastest pace since last September. Separately, there were signs of recovery out of the eurozone on Monday, although stark regional differences persist. While Germany powered ahead, France has suffered a sharp decline in fortunes. The UK services sector shrank for the first time in two years in December and economists had thought it would continue to contract at the start of the year. But the CIPS/Markit purchasing managers' index for January beat forecasts, rising to 51.5 last month, comfortably above the 50 mark that separates expansion from contraction. The news will offer some respite to the embattled chancellor, George Osborne, who has faced accusations that his austerity programme has brought the UK economy to its knees. GDP declined in the final three months of 2012, bringing Britain to the brink of its third recession in four years \u2013 using the technical definition of a recession as two consecutive quarters of contraction. Rob Wood of Berenberg Bank said: \"The PMI needed to increase smartly in January if the UK was to avoid a triple-dip recession, as it was at a three and a half year low in December. So the surge this month confirms that the UK continues to stagnate, rather than slipping back into recession.\" Improved demand drove growth in services in January, and companies took on more staff. Business confidence also rose to an eight-month high, with many companies forecasting a brighter economic climate. The upbeat report came despite the snow in January, which ground transport to a halt and caused thousands of schools to close. That stopped many Britons getting to work. Shops and restaurants were left empty, construction was hit and supply chains were disrupted. Chris Williamson, an economist at Markit, said: \"Stronger growth would inevitably have been recorded had the country not suffered the heavy snowfall, suggesting the underlying trend is even stronger than these numbers indicate.\" The services data follows news that retail sales picked up in January and manufacturing improved, although Britain's construction industry continued to decline. Taken together, the data supports the belief that the Bank of England will leave interest rates and its quantitative easing programme unchanged when it meets later this week. Wood said: \"[The members of the MPC are] likely to stand pat, again, as they resolutely keep the faith in their story that the UK will see decent growth in the second half of the year. Inflation is also uncomfortably high for some on the policy committee, who think the economy can sustain only very weak growth without pushing inflation even higher.\" Across the channel, Markit's eurozone composite PMI \u2013 which is based on business activity across thousands of companies and provides a good gauge of economic growth \u2013 rose in January to a 10-month high of 48.6 from 47.2 in December. Although it remains below the 50 mark, the reading has risen for past three months, suggesting the eurozone's battered economy has bottomed out. But there were stark differences across the region. German PMI chalked up its biggest one-month rise since August 2009, soaring to 54.4, its highest level since June 2011. That contrasts sharply with France, where the reading for business activity across the private sector plummeted to 42.7, its lowest level in nearly four years. The French PMI for services was even below readings from perennial laggards Spain and Italy. Jennifer McKeown, economist at Capital Economics, said: \"That's a really worrying sign. It's going to cause more tensions between Germany and France on various aspects of eurozone management. France will continue to call for more supportive policy, not just for the periphery but the eurozone as a whole. Germany is taking a much more hardline stance.\"",

GDP declined in the final three months of 2012, bringing Britain to the brink of its third recession in four years \u2013 using the technical definition of a recession as two consecutive quarters of contraction.</p> <p>Rob Wood of Berenberg Bank said: \"The PMI needed to increase smartly in January if the UK was to avoid a triple-dip recession, as it was at a three and a half year low in December. So the surge this month confirms that the UK continues to stagnate, rather than slipping back into recession.\"</p> <p>Improved demand drove growth in services in January, and companies took on more staff. Business confidence also rose to an eight-month high, with many companies forecasting a brighter economic climate.</p> <p>The upbeat report came despite the snow in January, which ground transport to a halt and caused thousands of schools to close. That stopped many Britons getting to work. Shops and restaurants were left empty, construction was hit and supply chains were disrupted. Chris Williamson, an economist at Markit, said: \"Stronger growth would inevitably have been recorded had the country not suffered the heavy snowfall, suggesting the underlying trend is even stronger than these numbers indicate.\"</p> <p>The services data follows news that retail sales picked up in January and manufacturing improved, although Britain's construction industry continued to decline.</p> <p>Taken together, the data supports the belief that the Bank of England will leave interest rates and its quantitative easing programme unchanged when it meets later this week. Wood said: \"[The members of the MPC are] likely to stand pat, again, as they resolutely keep the faith in their story that the UK will see decent growth in the second half of the year. Inflation is also uncomfortably high for some on the policy committee, who think the economy can sustain only very weak growth without pushing inflation even higher.\"</p> <p>Across the channel, Markit's eurozone composite PMI \u2013 which is based on business activity across thousands of companies and provides a good gauge of economic growth \u2013 rose in January to a 10-month high of 48.6 from 47.2 in December.</p> <p>Although it remains below the 50 mark, the reading has risen for past three months, suggesting the eurozone's battered economy has bottomed out.</p> <p>But there were stark differences across the region. German PMI chalked up its biggest one-month rise since August 2009, soaring to 54.4, its highest level since June 2011.</p> <p>That contrasts sharply with France, where the reading for business activity across the private sector plummeted to 42.7, its lowest level in nearly four years. The French PMI for services was even below readings from perennial laggards Spain and Italy.</p> <p>Jennifer McKeown, economist at Capital Economics, said: \"That's a really worrying sign. It's going to cause more tensions between Germany and France on various aspects of eurozone management. France will continue to call for more supportive policy, not just for the periphery but the eurozone as a whole. Germany is taking a much more hardline stance.\"</p>",

Surveys of the services sectors in France, Spain and Italy on Tuesday were shocking, and must lead to higher unemployment and lower GDP growth over the coming year.

Other names on its list of possible targets include Micro Focus International, steady at 622.5p, and Ophir Energy, down 0.5p at 500p. On the other hand it has removed a number of companies which it feels are no longer in the takeover frame, including Informa, down 4.3p at 479.1p, and Smith and Nephew, 14.5p lower at 707p. Aegis, unchanged at 235p, has been taken out because it has actually received a bid, from Japan's Dentsu.",

On Sunday, the bank announced the departures of its finance director, Chris Lucas \u2013 who is under investigation over fundraising that helped the bank avoid a taxpayer bailout \u2013 and the legal counsel Mark Harding. Lucas is retiring, and his departure is unconnected to the continuing FSA investigation into disclosures of \"commercial arrangements\" with investors, including some in Qatar, in two fundraisings in 2008. The bank says it made all the necessary disclosures. Jenkins last week waived his bonus, of at least \u00a31m, after the allegations. As part of an overhaul of the board, the new chairman, Sir David Walker, named Diane de Saint Victor as a nonexecutive director. She is head of legal and integrity for the Swiss power company ABB. The cost of the PPI scandal, in which customers were sold insurance to cover repayments if they fell ill or lost their jobs, continues to mount. It has already reached \u00a312bn across the sector, with Lloyds Banking Group so far having the largest bill, of \u00a35.3bn. Other banks may also need to raise their provisions. Sandy Chen, banks analyst at Cenkos, said: \"We had noted last week that the financial ombudsman had received more complaints in the fourth quarter of 2012 than in any single year between 2000 and 2010, with 80.5% of those complaints related to PPI. \"We also expect that the banks will continue to fight the claims, but this strategy could backfire if the regulator determines that customers haven't been treated fairly in the compensation process.\"",

      "bodyText": "Britain's recovery will be delayed until next year, according to a leading forecaster, which has warned that without increased government spending on infrastructure projects and greater efforts from the Bank of England to stimulate demand, the economy will continue to suffer. The National Institute of Economic and Social Research thinktank said growth in 2013 would reach only 0.7% before pushing up to 1.5% in 2014. The figures will dismay the chancellor, who is under intense pressure from all sides to kickstart growth this year. Opposition MPs want him to delay cuts to public spending, while MPs on his right flank have demanded that he push through tax cuts to boost growth, even at the expense of further reductions in welfare payments. NIESR, run by former government economist Jonathan Portes, said the recovery would depend on a resumption of consumer spending, higher spending by private companies and export sales. \"It remains our view that such a recovery would best be supported by a significant increase in public sector net investment, with looser fiscal policy in the short term while demand remains weak, and radical reform of the financial sector to support lending to the real economy,\" the think tank said. A delay in some public spending cuts would also support consumer confidence in a year when welfare cuts are expected to take their toll on consumption. NIESR's gloomy assessment of the UK's prospects reinforces the thinktank's long-held view that Britain is locked in the longest depression since the 1920s and that it will be several years before growth breaks through the 2% barrier. The figures follow a string of indicators showing the UK heading into a triple-dip recession after the economy contracted in the last three months of 2012. Figures for the manufacturing and construction industries showed them both slowing and are expected to be matched by a survey of the services sector on Tuesday, which accounts for around three-quarters of all economic activity. The Bank of England's monetary policy committee meets on Thursday to discuss cutting interest rates and extending its \u00a3375bn quantitative easing programme of injecting funds into the economy to boost lending. It is expected to maintain its current policy, despite calls for a cut in the base rate from 0.5% to 0.25% and an increase in QE. NIESR's reports have shown the UK avoiding a third recession in four years, though only by a whisker. It said the concern \"should not be whether or not the economy shrank slightly at the start of 2013 to fulfil the 'technical' definition of recession, or whether (as we expect) there is slight growth; but on the broader question of whether stagnation persists throughout 2013\".
