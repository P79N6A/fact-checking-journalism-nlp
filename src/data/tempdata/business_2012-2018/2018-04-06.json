The Dow Jones industrial average closed 572 points down, or around 2.3%. Boeing and Caterpillar, considered vulnerable in any trade war with China, fell by 3.1% and 3.5%, respectively. The losses wiped out the major indexes\u2019 gains for the week, with the S&amp;P 500 down 1.7% and the Nasdaq down 2.2% as investors moved into haven assets such as bonds and gold. China announced fresh tariffs on 106 US products on Wednesday. A day later, Trump asked US trade representatives to consider $100bn in additional tariffs against China. \u201cChina, which is a great economic power, is considered a Developing Nation within the World Trade Organization,\u201d the president tweeted on Friday. \u201cThey therefore get tremendous perks and advantages, especially over the US. Does anybody think this is fair. We were badly represented. The WTO is unfair to US.\u201d China\u2019s commerce ministry said it would respond commensurate to US action. \u201cThe Chinese side will follow suit to the end, not hesitate to pay any price, resolutely counterattack and take new comprehensive measures in response,\u201d the ministry said via its website, citing an unnamed spokesman. The statement added that China \u201cdoesn\u2019t want\u201d a trade war, but is \u201cnot afraid to fight one\u201d. Technology stocks were also hit on the New York exchanges, with Apple and Amazon declining more than 2%. US oil stocks fell 2.3% on fears Beijing could restrict crude exports. China is the second largest importer of US oil, after Canada. The stock market drops came despite efforts by Trump officials to downplay any likelihood that new tariffs would be enacted. The US treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin, appearing on CNBC, said he was \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d the US would reach a resolution with China. The National Economic Council director, Larry Kudlow, told Bloomberg talks with China had not begun. \u201cChina\u2019s response to our complaints \u2026 has been unsatisfactory,\u201d he said. But he also stressed there was an open line of communication, saying: \u201cThis is a moderate, tempered approach that we are taking. This is not a trade war.\u201d Kudlow repeated US concern over technology transfers. \u201cThere\u2019s no secret here,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve got enormous trade and tariff barriers. They\u2019ve got to stop their stealing of the intellectual property that we try to use in any company around the world. Those are good places to start.\u201d Earlier in the day, stocks were hit after the latest US jobs report missed targets. The US economy added just 103,000 jobs in March, well below the 170,000 forecast by economists polled by Bloomberg MarketWatch. The US still shows the tightest labor market in nearly two decades.",

      "bodyText": "As the US and China trade tariff threats, most analysts expect that talks will resolve the issue. But there are signs that an actual, short-term exchange of tariffs would be felt most acutely in battleground states like Ohio and Iowa, sometimes described as Trump country, as the midterm elections approach. After the latest round of threats \u2013 Donald Trump threatening to impose another $100bn of tariffs, Beijing responding that it would \u201cdedicate itself to the end and at any cost and will definitely fight back firmly\u201d \u2013 the president was criticized inside his own party. \u201cHe\u2019s threatening to light American agriculture on fire,\u201d said Ben Sasse, a Nebraska Republican senator and Trump critic who faces re-election in November. \u201cLet\u2019s absolutely take on Chinese bad behaviour, but with a plan that punishes them instead of us. This is the dumbest possible way to do this. \u201cHopefully the president is just blowing off steam again, but if he\u2019s even half-serious, this is nuts. China is guilty of many things but the president has no actual plan to win right now.\u201d Trump claimed Americans would be better off in the long run. \u201cI\u2019m not saying there won\u2019t be a little pain,\u201d he told WABC Radio\u2019s Bernie &amp; Sid in the Morning in an interview broadcast on Friday. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have a much stronger country when we\u2019re finished, and that\u2019s what I\u2019m all about.\u201d New tariffs could take up to six months to implement, after deadlines for public and business consultations stretching to 22 May. The US would typically then introduce tariffs within 30 days but could wait up to 180 \u2013 into November and the midterm elections. Analysts say the US is more vulnerable to Chinese tariffs on farming and manufacturing than China is to US-imposed tariffs on technology. In Iowa, farmers would be hit by soybean tariffs and makers of farm equipment, including John Deere tractors, would be affected too. \u201cYou\u2019re going to see hits across the board\u201d including job losses, economist Chad Hart told the Des Moines Register. In Sioux county, where Trump took more than 80% of the vote in 2016, 60-year-old hog farmer Marv Van Den Top told the paper: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t sit here today and say I will definitely support him again. This here could be a real negative for him.\u201d The Brookings Institution has offered a detailed breakdown of the likely effect of China\u2019s proposed tariffs on jobs in industries including fresh and dried fruit and nut farming, stainless steel pipes, pork products, modified ethanol, scrap aluminium and wineries. \u201cThe Chinese government has always engaged very strategically on international trade and investment policy, so it shouldn\u2019t be a surprise they\u2019re doing so in this instance,\u201d Brookings analyst Geoffrey Gertz told the Guardian. \u201cThey\u2019ve learned how to navigate the rules of the international trade system to advance their own interests, including by threatening carefully targeted retaliation.\u201d Gertz predicted the US and China would reach a negotiated solution. \u201cRight now the US doesn\u2019t have a clear set of objectives, let alone a feasible strategy to achieve them,\u201d he said. \u201cUltimately the Trump administration will want to be able to announce they\u2019ve negotiated a great deal to avert this looming conflict, and so I suspect in the end we\u2019ll see some kind of negotiated deal.\u201d On Wednesday, the White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said it was \u201cpossible\u201d US tariffs would not go into effect at all. \u201cIt\u2019s part of the process,\u201d Kudlow told reporters. \u201cI mean, I would take the president seriously on this tariff issue. You know, there are carrots and sticks in life, but he is ultimately a free trader. He\u2019s said that to me, he\u2019s said it publicly. So he wants to solve this with the least amount of pain.\u201d \u2018A devastating effect\u2019 If China does impose tariffs, soybean farmers would be hit hard. China is the most important consumer of US soybeans, purchasing about 1bn bushels annually, or 61% of total US soybean exports, more than 30% of production. Since the largest soybean producing states are Illinois, Iowa and Minnesota, Beijing is clearly looking to pressure Trump supporters. The American Soybean Association president and Iowa farmer, John Heisdorffer, warned: \u201cA 25% tariff on US soybeans into China will have a devastating effect on every soybean farmer in America.\u201d Heisdorffer also described \u201creal money lost for farmers\u201d, which would be \u201centirely preventable\u201d. Experts expect the effect of such tariffs to be felt in the short term, around the midterms. At first, farmers in Brazil, Argentina or Australia might step up to supply Chinese buyers. But in a note to clients, Goldman Sachs predicted China would seek supplies from the US in the long term. On Thursday, the agriculture secretary, Sonny Perdue, said he had raised farmers\u2019 concerns with the president. Perdue later tweeted: \u201cUS farmers are patriots [and] want to help defend their country against unfair trade practices.\u201d He also quoted the president as saying: \u201cSonny, tell them we\u2019re going to take care of our farmers.\u201d Soy farmers are not alone in calling for the administration to turn to dialogue. After China warned it would increase tariffs on American cars, Ford and General Motors called for talks. China imports nearly 270,000 US vehicles, worth $11bn. US imports of Chinese cars are negligible. Ford ships about 80,000 vehicles a year to China. Tariffs could also affect plans to shift production of the Focus to China. The US aviation sector, which accounted for $13.2bn in exports to China in 2016, also urged the two sides to resolve their differences. The message was repeated across other industries. Trump\u2019s appointees are also talking down the prospect of a trade war. In an interview with CNBC, the commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, said tariffs announced by China would affect a mere 0.3% of America\u2019s gross domestic product. \u201cSo it\u2019s hardly a life-threatening activity,\u201d he said. The president, however, seems persistent.",

      "bodyText": "And finally...Larry Kudlow, adviser to Donald Trump and national economic council director has been speaking to Bloomberg TV about China. As uncertainty swirls around global markets, Kudlow said there was no timetable in place or planned negotiations following President Trump\u2019s declaration that he was considering new $100bn tariffs on China. On that note, we\u2019ll close up for the day. Thank you for reading the blog and please join us again on Monday. Have a good weekend. European markets are still largely in the red but the extent of losses has eased. The FTSE is roughly flat. FTSE 100: -0.1% at 7,196 Germany\u2019s Dax: -0.6% at 12,234 France\u2019s CAC: -0.2% at 5,265 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: -0.2% 22,929 Spain\u2019s IBEX: -0.3% at 9,716 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: -0.3% at 375 The opening bell has rung and US markets are down as fears of a trade war with China escalate and jobs disappointed. Dow Jones: -1% at 24,270 S&amp;P 500: -0.9% at 2,640 Nasdaq: -1.1% at 7,000 Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at currency firm Oanda says that the dollar has been little moved by the big miss on US jobs because traders have other things on their minds: It\u2019s not often that the see a miss of around 88,000 in the US job creation figures and markets shrug it off but that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019ve seen today. The US jobs report was somewhat overshadowed this week by the ongoing back and forth between the world\u2019s two largest economies which has threatened to disrupt the period of strong growth the global economy is seeing. Despite that, traders as ever were paying very close attention to the data release and were clearly unmoved by what they saw, despite the non-farm payrolls number being well below expectations. The 103,000 increase in US jobs in March was well below the 202,000 average of the past three months. But Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics, says the non-farm payrolls report is typically volatile: The modest 103,000 gain in payroll employment in March, which follows a massive 326,000 gain in February, is a good illustration of the inherent volatility in the non-farm payroll data. The March gain was the worst in six months. The February gain was the best in two-and-a-half years. Economists at ING say the US Federal Reserve is likely to shrug off the weak jobs growth in March, instead focusing on the pick-up in wage growth to 2.7% (as expected) from 2.6%. The bank\u2019s James Smith says we\u2019re still on track for three more interest rate rises this year: A rebound in wage growth will outweigh any concerns over lower payrolls for the Fed, as policymakers gear up for three more hikes this year. With core inflation set to reach the 2% level again in data released next week, we expect the Fed to raise rates a further three times this year \u2013 although of course, policymakers will also have a firm eye on escalating global trade tensions. The headline figure on March payrolls was a very big miss but there was better news on wage growth, which picked up to 2.7% year-on-year last month from 2.6% in February. But a predicted fall in the jobless rate to 4% did not materialise, instead remaining unchanged at 4.1% according to the US Labor Department. The department said the 103,000 increase in payrolls in March was driven by the manufacturing, health care and mining sectors, as well as professional and business services. Employment in the retail and construction sectors fell last month after large gains in February. The closely watched report is just out and shows the US economy added 103,000 jobs in March. It was the lowest in six months and sharply below economists\u2019 forecasts of 193,000. The figure for February was revised up to 326,000 from 313,000. It\u2019s almost time... President Trump is standing by his trade policy today: He has also retweeted his tweet from Wednesday when he claimed America was not in a trade war with China: The government\u2019s sugar tax comes into force today, in an attempt to lower sugar consumption and reduce obesity rates in the UK. Officially called the soft drinks levy, prices of some drinks will rise as manufactures pass on some of their additional costs. The Institute for Fiscal Studies says the policy is well-targeted to reduce sugar consumption among the young: Trade war or rebalancing? Here is our full story on this morning\u2019s UK productivity figures, which showed a pick-up for a second consecutive quarter at the end of 2017: It\u2019s non-farm payrolls day, and we\u2019ll get the latest snapshot of the US jobs market when the Labor Department publishes the March figures at 1.30pm UK time. Here is what is expected from economists polled by Reuters. (Figures in brackets show February\u2019s figures, which could be revised.) US non-farm payrolls: +193,000 (+313,000) Unemployment rate: 4% (4.1%) Average earnings growth, year-on year: 2.7% (2.6%) US stock index futures are down as a gloomy mood persists among investors on both sides of the Atlantic: Dow futures: -0.8% Nasdaq futures: -0.8% S&amp;P futures: -0.7% The Institute of Directors says its too early to get excited about the long-awaited pick-up in UK productivity. Senior economist Tej Parikh says: While productivity growth has been near its strongest since the recession in recent quarters, it\u2019s still too early to begin heralding this as the start of a new trend. For starters, a drop-off in hours worked played a key role in pushing up the numbers, while all-important output growth has continued to be modest. So, policymakers need to keep their foot on the gas. Business leaders would encourage the government to push forward with consultations and with allocating funding from the Industrial Strategy, to help kick-start the economic engine. Solving the productivity puzzle will require a comprehensive approach. Directors want to see improvements in the nation\u2019s physical and digital infrastructure, to help boost idea diffusion and connectivity between regions. But macro investments need to be matched by direct support for businesses, particularly the \u2018long tail\u2019 of low productivity SMEs. These firms need greater assistance to absorb new technologies and to upskill their workers and management in order to deliver efficiency enhancing changes to their organisations.\u201d Robert Jenrick, exchequer secretary to the Treasury, has responded to the productivity figures with the usual stuff: We want to increase productivity growth to ensure higher living standards for people across the country. It\u2019s encouraging we\u2019ve had the best two quarters of productivity growth since the financial crisis but we must improve productivity over the longer term, which is why we are increasing public investment in our schools, hospitals, and infrastructure in this parliament to the highest sustained level in 40 years. Productivity in the UK grew by 0.7% in the fourth quarter of 2017, according to figures published this morning by the Office for National Statistics. It was the second consecutive quarter of productivity growth - as measured by output per hour - and left productivity 1.8% above its peak in the fourth quarter of 2007, before the financial crisis took hold. Some decent news after a prolonged period of weak productivity since the beginning of the crisis which has left the UK lagging behind other economies and created a \u201cproductivity puzzle\u201d for economists, who would have expected to see a pick-up after the downturn. As the ONS explains: An increase of 0.7% is slightly higher than the average quarterly rate of productivity growth in the decade prior to the 2008 economic downturn, since when UK productivity growth has been subdued. This sustained stagnation, often referred to as the \u201cproductivity puzzle\u201d, contrasts with patterns following previous UK economic downturns when productivity initially fell, but subsequently recovered to the previous trend rate of growth. The graph below shows how UK productivity failed to pick-up again as expected after the financial crisis: Marks and Spencer is the biggest faller on the FTSE 100 this morning, closely followed by Next. Marks and Spencer: -3.3% at 264.9p Next: -2.8% at \u00a346.83 Two of the biggest names on Britain\u2019s high streets have been hit by a negative note from investment bank Citigroup, which has downgraded both retail stocks. The downgrade came with the following assessment from the bank\u2019s retail analysts: Investors should buy online over offline, Europe over UK, and brands over retailers. Losses have accelerated on markets across Europe this morning, with all major indices in the red as trade war fears continue to weigh on investor sentiment: Neil Wilson, analyst at ETX Capital, says investors shouldn\u2019t be too concerned about Trump\u2019s threat because the additional tariffs might never be imposed. A fresh salvo from Trump on tariffs is weighing on markets today, but for all the posturing we are a long way from an all-out trade war. European indices have opened in the red and US futures point to some losses again. But we are a long way from this becoming policy by either the US or China. These remain merely proposals with a lot of ways and time for the administration to back out. It all looks more like a classic Trump negotiation - float an extreme position to step back from the worst-case scenario in return for some big concessions. Both sides would prefer to negotiate a settlement. Nevertheless, markets will be sensitive to the fact that a full-blown trade war could result if the two camps back themselves into a corner. The risk of miscalculation increases the more the two sides push this. The US-China trade spat could wipe 0.5% off Chinese gross domestic product - if the US carries out its latest threats and Beijing responds. That is an estimate from economists at Capital Economics, who were predicting the row would cost China 0.1% in GDP before the latest escalation. They suggest that if the US does impose new tariffs on $100bn of Chinese imports, President Xi Jinping may feel he has no choice but to once again respond in kind. Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at the consultancy, explains the risks: This would mean expanding the proposed Chinese tariff list to cover nearly all imports from the US, which Chinese data put at $155bn last year. These higher stakes increase the urgency of reaching an agreement with the US but also risk a more damaging outcome if talks break down. Fighting talk from Beijing this morning as it responds to Trump\u2019s revelation that he is considering new $100bn tariffs on goods imported from China. China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce said in a statement: If the US side disregards opposition from China and the international community and insists on carrying out unilateralism and trade protectionism, the Chinese side will take them on until the end at any cost. We don\u2019t want a trade war, but we aren\u2019t afraid of fighting one. In the very definition of a tit-for-tat row, Donald Trump announced on Thursday night that he had instructed the US trade representative to consider slapping $100bn in additional tariffs on Chinese goods. He said in a statement the further measures were being considered \u201cin light of China\u2019s unfair retaliation\u201d against earlier US trade actions. It came a day after China issued a $50bn list of US goods including soybeans and small aircraft for possible import tariff hikes. That itself was 11 hours after the White House announced a list of 1,333 Chinese imports, also worth about $50bn, for punitive tariffs of 25%. Traders at spread-betting firm IG are expecting US markets to open lower. (The Wall Street opening bell goes at 2.30pm BST.) The FTSE 100 has opened lower this morning, along with the rest of its major European peers, as investors fear a full-blown trade war between the world\u2019s two largest economies. FTSE 100: -0.3% Germany\u2019s DAX: -0.5% France\u2019s CAC: -0.4% Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: -0.2% Spain\u2019s IBEX: -0.6% Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: -0.3% Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Investors were left rattled after Donald Trump revealed after markets closed on Thursday night that he was considering imposing new tariffs on $100bn of goods imported from China. The news threw traders, who had been hopeful that a full-blown trade war could be avoided. China has responded this morning by saying that Beijing would fight the US \u201cat any cost\u201d. Jasper Lawler from London Capital Group explains how investors reacted to the latest developments: Trumps announcement of a potential further $100 billion of tariffs on China briskly ended any hopes of an amicable conclusion to escalating trade tensions, initially sent Asian markets tumbling, along with European and US futures sharply lower. Whilst the knee jerk reaction was a heavy sell off from traders, markets since pared some losses, with Asia closing mixed and Europe still pointing to a lower start but less extreme than when the news broke. The message from the White House has been mixed at best this week, with White House advisor Larry Kudlow and other officials playing down any trade war fears, which worked to boost the markets. However, much of the good work by Kudlow and co was undone by Trump on Thursday evening, who is showing an increasingly hard-line approach. Stick with us for all the latest updates on the US/China spat. Also coming up today is the US non-farm payrolls report for March at 1.30pm BST. And its day one of the UK\u2019s new tax on sugary drinks.",

      "bodyText": "The Co-op is planning a major push into running schools after its exit from banking helped the group bounce back into the black. The mutual is to invest \u00a33.5m in expanding academies from 12 to 40 over three years with a plan to take over failing schools in the north of England. The Co-op, which includes funeral parlours, grocery stores and financial services, made a profit of \u00a372m in the year to 6 January, swinging back from a \u00a3132m loss in the previous year, which reflected the \u00a3185m writedown of its stake in the Co-operative bank to nil. The group sold its final stake in the bank in the autumn. Total sales remained stable at \u00a39.5bn as sales at its established grocery stores rose 3.4%. Grocery sales were flat at \u00a37.1bn after dozens of larger stores were sold. Funeral services and will writing revenues rose by 4% to \u00a3343m while insurance revenues slid from \u00a3439m to \u00a3331m as the result of a new reinsurance contract. Steve Murrells, group chief executive who took charge last year, said he wanted to drive growth by creating a more commercial Co-op that also had a \u201cdistinctive voice in society\u201d. He said that a big expansion into schools was part of showing how the Co-op did things differently. \u201cWe need a vibrant, commercially successful business and the more successful they are the more we can do in society,\u201d he said. \u201cThe academy investment is exactly that playing out. It is our chance to help in an areas that needs a lot of care.\u201d The Co-op took on its first academy in Manchester in 2010 and now also runs schools in Leeds and Stoke. Murrells said the new schools would be in the north so they could share expertise and because there was more need in that part of the country. \u201cI think education needs our help and we have got a good track record on turning those schools around,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is not based on a business case; it is based on doing the right thing.\u201d Murrells insisted that the move would not be a distraction for the business, after finally exiting the bank that had to be rescued from collapse and nearly brought down the Co-op Group in 2013, as they would be run by a \u201csolid management team that are already there and eager to do more\u201d. The schools expansion is likely to raise fears that the Co-op is stretching its management just as it battles to survive in a tough grocery market where discounters Aldi and Lidl are taking an increasing market share. Convenience store chains, which include the Co-op, are facing particular turmoil as the UK\u2019s biggest supermarket chain, Tesco, takes over major wholesaler Booker, head of the Premier, Londis and Budgens symbol groups, which lend their name and products to independent stores. The Co-op is still awaiting clearance from competition authorities for its planned \u00a3143m takeover of the Nisa wholesale and symbol group and is also taking over supply of the Costcutter chain. The Co-op faces an inquiry into its treatment of suppliers by the grocery industry watchdog that could lead to a multimillion pound fine. Murrells said \u201cwe don\u2019t feel great about where we find ourselves\u201d, but said the Co-op was already improving its practices and was focused on \u201censuring we get things right and come back stronger\u201d in dealing with suppliers. \u201cThis is not a crisis, it is not an on-going problem and we will learn quickly and fix it,\u201d he said.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The productivity of British workers in the second half of 2017 rose at the fastest rate since before the financial crisis, handing a rare boost to the government. Labour productivity, or economic output per hour of work, rose by 0.7% in the three months to December, marking the second consecutive quarter for positive growth, the Office for National Statistics said. Together, the two periods showed the strongest growth rate seen since the second half of 2005. But despite the positive performance, the rate of increase in worker efficiency for last year as a whole still languished below its pre-crisis levels, following a weak start to 2017. Economists also warned the increase in productivity, which is seen as one of the most important determinants for raising living standards, may have come due to falling numbers of hours worked rather than because companies had substantially boosted their economic output. Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said the increase came following a surprising drop in the number of hours worked in the second half of last year \u2013 a trend that had since been reversed in the first months of 2018. \u201cThe UK has a lot of catching up to do on the productivity front,\u201d he said. ONS deputy chief economist Richard Heysalso said much of the increase could have come from a fall in average hours worked, adding: \u201cA weak start to the year means annual growth was only 1%, half the historic average rate.\u201d Sluggish growth in the efficiency of workers in Britain, held back in part since the financial crisis by the creation of low-skilled jobs, has been key to holding down wage growth and rising living standards across the economy. As a result, boosting productivity has become a priority among ministers, who are attempting to use the industrial strategy to improve efficiency rates. The improvements in the final quarter of 2017 were driven by non-financial services firms such as shops, hotels and restaurants, as well as manufacturers. The financial sector and firms involved in industrial production, such as electricity, gas and agriculture, acted as a drag on the growth rate. However, the ONS said the productivity of British workers still remains well below the rates that could have been achieved had productivity growth continued at its pre-downturn rate. The UK lags much of continental Europe and many other major economic rivals, with labour productivity about 16.3% below the average for the other G7 economies. Dave Innes, economist at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, said low-wage sectors such as retail and hospitality had a particularly poor track record. Boosting productivity in these sectors to the levels seen in Germany, France and the Netherlands would close between a fifth and a quarter of the UK\u2019s productivity gap with them, he said. \u201cImproving pay and performance for our baristas and bar staff may be part of the answer,\u201d Innes said. Treasury minister Robert Jenrick said the latest figures were encouraging. \u201cWe want to increase productivity growth to ensure higher living standards for people across the country.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The AGL chief executive, Andy Vesey, says he plans to \u201cfully execute\u201d his vision of transforming the Liddell coal-fired power station into a renewables hub, saying it will bring cheaper, greener and more reliable energy, while providing quality, long-term jobs for decades. Vesey left little doubt about his desired future for the plant during a speech on energy policy on Friday, again defying renewed pressure from the Turnbull government. He said transforming the site into an integrated renewables hub \u2013 comprising renewable generation, batteries, gas and demand response \u2013 would be vastly preferable to extending its life for several years. \u201cThis plan is more reliable, it is a better cost alternative, and provides lower impact on the environment,\u201d he said. \u201cAs well as having the continued economic activity at that site, which the community depends on, and having jobs, high quality jobs, that will last for decades.\u201d Vesey was speaking at a Committee for Economic Development of Australia event in Sydney following sustained pressure from the Turnbull government over the future of Liddell. The federal government wants to extend the plant\u2019s life until its expansion of the Snowy Hydro scheme is completed. The former deputy prime minister Barnaby Joyce accused AGL of \u201cshorting the market\u201d by hanging on to the ageing power plant, despite at least some level of interest from Alinta Energy. The energy minister, Josh Frydenberg, questioned why AGL had suddenly become so interested in keeping Liddell, given that last year the company said it was on a \u201csliding scale to oblivion\u201d. He said AGL had a \u201cduty\u201d to consider the offer. \u201cThey have a fiduciary duty to properly consider the offer from Alinta, and we know that Alinta is very serious,\u201d he told Sky News. Vesey addressed that point directly before beginning his address on Friday. \u201cI want to start this by addressing one of the elephants in the room and that is that AGL is a public company. From time to time we will get unsolicited bids on various components of our business,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are duty bound to review them. If they have merit, if they have value for our shareholders, benefits for our customers, they meet the obligations that we have to the communities we serve and our people, we will take them very seriously.\u201d Vesey said Liddell remained an \u201cextremely valuable piece of our portfolio\u201d until its closure. But he said the plan AGL had proposed for Liddell had anticipated the Turnbull government\u2019s national energy guarantee. \u201cThe plan that we put together anticipated the national energy guarantee, it anticipated policy settings that would direct the competitive market to deliver what the market needs,\u201d Vesey said. \u201cWe believe in competitive markets and everybody should have a chance to actually have other plans, and other technologies ... but if the market doesn\u2019t respond, we plan on fully executing our plan,\u201d he said. He said prices would come down as more and more investment in renewables took place, a simple matter of supply and demand.",

      "body": "<p>The AGL chief executive, Andy Vesey, says he plans to \u201cfully execute\u201d his vision of transforming the Liddell coal-fired power station into a renewables hub, saying it will bring cheaper, greener and more reliable energy, while providing quality, long-term jobs for decades. </p> <p>Vesey left little doubt about his desired future for the plant during a speech on energy policy on Friday, again defying renewed <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/apr/06/agl-hits-back-at-barnaby-joyce-claim-it-is-shorting-the-energy-market\">pressure from the Turnbull government</a>. </p> <p>He said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/sep/27/agl-says-it-can-replace-liddell-with-renewables-gas-power-and-batteries\">transforming the site into an integrated renewables hub</a> \u2013 comprising renewable generation, batteries, gas and demand response \u2013 would be vastly preferable to extending its life for several years. <br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/apr/04/scott-morrison-new-coal-fired-power-station-not-the-answer\">Scott Morrison: new coal-fired power station not the answer</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThis plan is more reliable, it is a better cost alternative, and provides lower impact on the environment,\u201d he said. \u201cAs well as having the continued economic activity at that site, which the community depends on, and having jobs, high quality jobs, that will last for decades.\u201d</p> <p>Vesey was speaking at a Committee for Economic Development of Australia event in Sydney following sustained pressure from the Turnbull government over the future of Liddell. </p> <p>The federal government wants to extend the plant\u2019s life until its <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/dec/21/snowy-hydro-2-viable-government-backed-study\">expansion of the Snowy Hydro scheme</a> is completed. </p> <p>The former deputy prime minister Barnaby Joyce <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/apr/06/agl-hits-back-at-barnaby-joyce-claim-it-is-shorting-the-energy-market\">accused AGL of \u201cshorting the market\u201d</a> by hanging on to the ageing power plant, despite at least <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/apr/04/alinta-energy-says-it-wants-to-buy-agls-liddell-coal-fired-power-station\">some level of interest from Alinta Energy</a>. </p> <p>The energy minister, Josh Frydenberg, questioned why AGL had suddenly become so interested in keeping Liddell, given that last year the company said it was on a \u201csliding scale to oblivion\u201d. He said AGL had a \u201cduty\u201d to consider the offer. </p> <p>\u201cThey have a fiduciary duty to properly consider the offer from Alinta, and we know that Alinta is very serious,\u201d he told Sky News.</p> <p>Vesey addressed that point directly before beginning his address on Friday. </p> <p>\u201cI want to start this by addressing one of the elephants in the room and that is that AGL is a public company. From time to time we will get unsolicited bids on various components of our business,\u201d he said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/12/for-energy-security-the-failing-liddell-coal-plant-is-the-last-thing-we-need\">For energy security, the failing Liddell coal plant is the last thing we need | Ben Oquist</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe are duty bound to review them. If they have merit, if they have value for our shareholders, benefits for our customers, they meet the obligations that we have to the communities we serve and our people, we will take them very seriously.\u201d</p> <p>Vesey said Liddell remained an \u201cextremely valuable piece of our portfolio\u201d until its closure. But he said the plan AGL had proposed for Liddell had anticipated the Turnbull government\u2019s national energy guarantee. </p> <p>\u201cThe plan that we put together anticipated the national energy guarantee, it anticipated policy settings that would direct the competitive market to deliver what the market needs,\u201d Vesey said. <br></p> <p>\u201cWe believe in competitive markets and everybody should have a chance to actually have other plans, and other technologies ... but if the market doesn\u2019t respond, we plan on fully executing our plan,\u201d he said. </p> <p>He said prices would come down as more and more investment in renewables took place, a simple matter of supply and demand. </p>",
