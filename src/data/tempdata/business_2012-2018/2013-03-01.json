      "bodyText": "Billionaire investor Warren Buffett admonished \"hand wringing\" bosses on Friday for failing to have faith in the US economy. In his annual letter to shareholders. Buffett, chairman of the Berkshire Hathaway investment fund, wrote there was \"a lot of hand-wringing last year among CEOs who cried 'uncertainty' when faced with capital allocation decisions\". This caution came even though many of their businesses enjoyed record levels of both earnings and cash last year, he added. \"At Berkshire, we didn't share their fears, instead spending a record $9.8bn (\u00a36.5bn) on plant and equipment in 2012, about 88% of it in the United States. That's 19% more than we spent in 2011, our previous high. \"Charlie [Munger, his long-time business partner] and I love investing large sums in worthwhile projects, whatever the pundits are saying. We instead heed the words from Gary Allan's new country song, Every Storm Runs Out of Rain.\" He added: \"Opportunities abound in America. A thought for my fellow CEOs: Of course, the immediate future is uncertain; America has faced the unknown since 1776.\" Buffett wrote that he was disappointed with his investment firm's performance over the year. For the ninth time in its 48 years, Berkshire's percentage increase in book value \u2013 his benchmark for Berkshire's investments \u2013 was less than the S&amp;P 500 index's percentage gain. But he said he and Munger expected to outperform the S&amp;P over time. Berkshire Hathaway's book value per share rose in 2012 by 14.4% while the S&amp;P was up 16%. \"Our luck, however, changed early this year,\" Buffett wrote of Berkshire's joint buyout of Heinz, the ketchup and food group. Buffett invested a total of $12bn in the company but said Berkshire was still looking for large acquisitions. \"Charlie and I have again donned our safari outfits and resumed our search for elephants,\" he wrote. Buffett defended his acquisition of 28 daily newspapers in the last 15 months for $344m. \"Charlie and I love newspapers and, if their economics make sense, will buy them even when they fall far short of the size threshold we would require for the purchase of, say, a widget company. \"Charlie and I believe that papers delivering comprehensive and reliable information to tightly bound communities and having a sensible internet strategy will remain viable for a long time. We do not believe that success will come from cutting either the news content or frequency of publication. Indeed, skimpy news coverage will almost certainly lead to skimpy readership.\" There was no mention of retirement in the letter. The 82-year-old investor has said he intends to split his job in two when he eventually steps aside. Two former hedge fund managers, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, have been appointed to help run Berkshire's portfolio and are assumed to be his heirs apparent.",

      "bodyText": "The government could sell off its stakes in the bailed-out banks at prices substantially lower than expected after it linked the payment of a \u00a31.5m bonus to Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio, the boss of Lloyds Banking Group, to selling part of the taxpayers' stake. Horta-Os\u00f3rio's bonus is linked to the government selling off a third of its 39% stake in the loss-making bank at share prices above 61p \u2013 considerably lower than the average price of 73.6p at which the taxpayer injected nearly \u00a320bn into the bank in 2008. The move reignited speculation that the government was considering a share sale in both Lloyds and Royal Bank of Scotland before the May 2015 general election, although the Treasury insisted there was no timetable for a selloff. RBS said last week that it could be ready to privatise part of the bank next year. The 61p figure has never previously been published in an official document and the equivalent figure for Royal Bank of Scotland is 407p \u2013 below the 500p average price at which the taxpayer injected \u00a345bn into the Edinburgh-based bank. Ian Gordon, a banks analyst at the City broker Investec, described the 61p target as \"a new 'contrived' break-even number for UK government accounting which conveniently ignores its average in-price of 73.6p\". Shares in Lloyds fell 2% on Friday to 53p after the bank reported a \u00a3570m loss for 2012 \u2013 better than the loss in 2011 of \u00a33.5bn \u2013 after being hit by another \u00a31.5bn provision for payment protection insurance (PPI) compensation. Its total bill for the mis-selling scandal is now \u00a36.8bn. Lloyds is still paying out a total of \u00a3375m in bonuses despite the losses. Sir Win Bischoff, the Lloyds chairman, said: \"Given the trajectory we have, I would have thought it could be likely [that there could] be a share sale within the next two years\". Lloyds stressed that Bischoff was not aware of a specific timetable. The Unite union was angered by the bonus for Horta-Os\u00f3rio, who said he had wanted his payout to be linked to taxpayers getting their money back on their 39% stake in the bank. \"My main objective is to get taxpayer money back,\" he said, adding he was \"very confident\" that this could be achieved. The government introduced the requirement that the Lloyds boss could not get his bonus in the next five years unless it had sold at least 33% of its stake in the bank above 61p. The alternative stipulation, devised by Lloyds, is for a sale once a share price of 73.6p \"has been reached for a given period of time\". The shares would not be released to him until 2018. Dominic Hook, national officer at Unite, said: \"Lloyds is still making a loss and it's tainted by scandal. There is no justification for Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio's share pot.\" The bank said the Treasury had \"informed us that 61p is the average price at which the equity support provided to Lloyds Banking Group is recorded in the public finances\". UK Financial Investments, which looks after the taxpayers' stakes in the bailed-out banks, has previously disclosed two prices for the Lloyds shares \u2013 the average price of 74p, which falls to 63p if the \u00a32.5bn fee Lloyds paid to exit the UK asset protection scheme is included. A Treasury spokesman said: \"The government's strategy remains to see Lloyds continue the progress it has made in reforming itself into a strong and sustainable bank that supports the British economy, which in time can be returned to full private ownership ... [T]here is still work to be done as it continues to deal with the legacy of the past.\" The 61p is based on the stock market price of the Lloyds shares when the government bought them rather than the actual price that the government paid, and has been in the government's accounts since 2010 when the \u00a365bn ploughed into both banks was valued at \u00a353.8bn. The scale of the PPI provision means that Lloyds is considering clawing back bonuses from 13 or so former and current executives. The former Lloyds boss Eric Daniels, who has already had \u00a3580,000 of his 2010 bonus clawed back, is thought to be among them. Daniels had recently said he believed the bank \"was on the side of the angels\" in handling PPI. Horta-Os\u00f3rio, who took over from him two years ago when he was ]hired from Santander on an \u00a38m-a-year pay package, said: \"In that case, I can only imagine what would have happened if we were not on the side of the angels.\" In return for the taxpayer bailout, the European commission has required Lloyds to sell off 632 branches. While negotiations are under way with the Co-op, Horta-Os\u00f3rio said the mutual was in discussions with the Financial Services Authority about its capital position. But it is also working on plans for a stock market flotation of the branches, which will take the centuries-old brand of Trustee Savings Bank and bring a rebranded Lloyds back on the high street.",

    "fields": {
      "standfirst": "Fancy financial footwork over the bailout suggests that the government is anxious to offload some of its shareholding", 
      "body": "<p>There is no fixed timetable for selling any shares in Lloyds and Royal Bank of Scotland, says the Treasury. Perfectly true, as far as it goes. But you can tell the government is champing at the bit, eager to offload a few, by the fancy financial footwork used on Friday to explain the price at which the state rescued Lloyds in 2009.</p> <p>In the past, this territory has been straightforward. UK Financial Investments, the body that \"manages\" the state's investments in the bailed-out banks, provides the arithmetic in its annual reports. Its text is clear: the Labour government invested in Lloyds in three tranches and \"the gross cost of these investments is \u00a320.3bn, at an average cost per share of 73.58p\". There's even an admirably clear table to explain the workings.</p> <p>So what's this 61p figure that appeared on Friday? Apparently, it is \"the average price at which the equity support provided to Lloyds Banking Group is recorded in the public finances\". But how can that be different from UKFI's calculation?</p> <p>It seems the Office for National Statistics used the average price in the market for Lloyds shares on the day of the investments, not the actual price paid by the state.</p> <p>It calls the overpayment a \"capital transfer\", explaining that it's all to do with permanent and temporary effects and that \u00a33.4bn of the \u00a320.3bn has been booked on the national debt.</p> <p>Forget the ONS' weird methodology. Common sense says you only show a profit on an investment when you sell at a price higher than the one you paid. The threshold for a profit on the Lloyds shares therefore remains 73.6p.</p> <p>Yes, the Labour government paid more than the market price at the time, but the Treasury shouldn't ignore that fact.</p> <p>Lloyds, to its credit, is not pushing the 61p figure. Indeed, it seems embarrassed that it has been obliged to use it in setting a condition for chief executive Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio's \u00a31.5bn bonus \u2013 he'll get his money if the state sells a third of its stake above that price. It was the Treasury's idea to use 61p. The goalposts have started to move. So did Lloyds' share price \u2013 it was down 2% to 53p. But, if and when 62p is seen, expect to hear the government declare victory, and a profit, far too early.</p> <h2>Glasenberg and the black kettles<br></h2> <p>\"I hope CEOs have learned their lesson. The big guys really screwed up.\" So said Ivan Glasenberg, multibillionaire chief executive of Glencore, this week in a blast against the mining industry's record in recent years of overbuilding and overinvesting.</p> <p>He makes a fair point, of course, since there have been some spectacular writedowns in asset values at big miners. But is Glasenberg really the man to preach?</p> <p>He has also been a director of Xstrata \u2013 where Glencore hopes soon to complete its takeover \u2013 since 2002. There have been no big writedowns (yet) at Xstrata but few would describe the company, circa 2006-08, as a model of level-headed financial sobriety in a room of excitable fools.</p> <p>Xstrata aggressively pursued a takeover of platinum producer Lonmin, to the point of bagging 29% of the shares, in late 2008, long after the whistle had blown on the commodities price boom. A humiliating 2-for-1 rights issue followed (causing a little difficulty for Glencore itself in the midst of the credit crunch) to repair a balance sheet overburdened with debt.</p> <p>OK, Glasenberg was only a non-executive director of Xstrata, but he was definitely a big guy: Glencore owned 35% of the shares and had two, and then three, boardroom seats.</p> <p>And, as we're on the subject of overoptimism, spare a thought for investors who invested in Glencore's flotation in May 2011 at 530p a share. That price has never been seen since and the shares now stand at 377p, down a little yesterday as completion of the Glenstrata deal was delayed again (maybe the Chinese competition authorities noticed that part of Glasenberg's speech about the importance of miners not building in order to keep the market \"tight\").</p> <p>Among London's big five mining stocks, only ailing Anglo-American's shares have done worse than Glencore's since the latter's IPO.</p> <p>That wasn't meant to be the script. Wasn't being big in trading commodities, as opposed to merely digging the stuff out of the ground, meant to offer shareholders protection? All will be explained in inimitable style with Tuesday's results, one assumes.</p> <h2>Blackout Britain?<br></h2> <p>It may be galling, but it's probably time to get less exercised about Centrica's booming profits and start to worry about something more important \u2013 like how will the UK keep the lights on.</p> <p>There have now been two serious warnings in a fortnight. The first was from Alistair Buchanan, chief executive of regulator Ofgem, who said there was \"horrendous serendipity\" in a large chunk of the UK's power generation (mainly coal) going offline just as global supplies of gas, the easiest power source to turn on in a hurry, could be squeezed.</p> <p>Sam Laidlaw, Centrica's chief executive, then said he wouldn't be building more gas-fired plants until new market legislation is in place, which could take another two years. He told the FT he thinks there is a possibility of rolling blackouts by 2017-18 if there are nuclear or other outages.</p> <p>Is Laidlaw trying to make himself even more unpopular by refusing to invest now? Not really. It is reasonable for Centrica to want to know how the government intends the market to work before it commits. That's just how the privatised energy industry works these days, as the government knows. The rate for having gas-fired plants on stand-by, for example, is vital commercial information.</p> <p>Buchanan and Laidlaw may not be disinterested parties in this debate, but warnings from high places about energy shortages in three and four years' time should not be ignored.

      "bodyText": "There is no fixed timetable for selling any shares in Lloyds and Royal Bank of Scotland, says the Treasury. Perfectly true, as far as it goes. But you can tell the government is champing at the bit, eager to offload a few, by the fancy financial footwork used on Friday to explain the price at which the state rescued Lloyds in 2009. In the past, this territory has been straightforward. UK Financial Investments, the body that \"manages\" the state's investments in the bailed-out banks, provides the arithmetic in its annual reports. Its text is clear: the Labour government invested in Lloyds in three tranches and \"the gross cost of these investments is \u00a320.3bn, at an average cost per share of 73.58p\". There's even an admirably clear table to explain the workings. So what's this 61p figure that appeared on Friday? Apparently, it is \"the average price at which the equity support provided to Lloyds Banking Group is recorded in the public finances\". But how can that be different from UKFI's calculation? It seems the Office for National Statistics used the average price in the market for Lloyds shares on the day of the investments, not the actual price paid by the state. It calls the overpayment a \"capital transfer\", explaining that it's all to do with permanent and temporary effects and that \u00a33.4bn of the \u00a320.3bn has been booked on the national debt. Forget the ONS' weird methodology. Common sense says you only show a profit on an investment when you sell at a price higher than the one you paid. The threshold for a profit on the Lloyds shares therefore remains 73.6p. Yes, the Labour government paid more than the market price at the time, but the Treasury shouldn't ignore that fact. Lloyds, to its credit, is not pushing the 61p figure. Indeed, it seems embarrassed that it has been obliged to use it in setting a condition for chief executive Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio's \u00a31.5bn bonus \u2013 he'll get his money if the state sells a third of its stake above that price. It was the Treasury's idea to use 61p. The goalposts have started to move. So did Lloyds' share price \u2013 it was down 2% to 53p. But, if and when 62p is seen, expect to hear the government declare victory, and a profit, far too early. Glasenberg and the black kettles \"I hope CEOs have learned their lesson. The big guys really screwed up.\" So said Ivan Glasenberg, multibillionaire chief executive of Glencore, this week in a blast against the mining industry's record in recent years of overbuilding and overinvesting. He makes a fair point, of course, since there have been some spectacular writedowns in asset values at big miners. But is Glasenberg really the man to preach? He has also been a director of Xstrata \u2013 where Glencore hopes soon to complete its takeover \u2013 since 2002. There have been no big writedowns (yet) at Xstrata but few would describe the company, circa 2006-08, as a model of level-headed financial sobriety in a room of excitable fools. Xstrata aggressively pursued a takeover of platinum producer Lonmin, to the point of bagging 29% of the shares, in late 2008, long after the whistle had blown on the commodities price boom. A humiliating 2-for-1 rights issue followed (causing a little difficulty for Glencore itself in the midst of the credit crunch) to repair a balance sheet overburdened with debt. OK, Glasenberg was only a non-executive director of Xstrata, but he was definitely a big guy: Glencore owned 35% of the shares and had two, and then three, boardroom seats. And, as we're on the subject of overoptimism, spare a thought for investors who invested in Glencore's flotation in May 2011 at 530p a share. That price has never been seen since and the shares now stand at 377p, down a little yesterday as completion of the Glenstrata deal was delayed again (maybe the Chinese competition authorities noticed that part of Glasenberg's speech about the importance of miners not building in order to keep the market \"tight\"). Among London's big five mining stocks, only ailing Anglo-American's shares have done worse than Glencore's since the latter's IPO. That wasn't meant to be the script. Wasn't being big in trading commodities, as opposed to merely digging the stuff out of the ground, meant to offer shareholders protection? All will be explained in inimitable style with Tuesday's results, one assumes. Blackout Britain? It may be galling, but it's probably time to get less exercised about Centrica's booming profits and start to worry about something more important \u2013 like how will the UK keep the lights on. There have now been two serious warnings in a fortnight. The first was from Alistair Buchanan, chief executive of regulator Ofgem, who said there was \"horrendous serendipity\" in a large chunk of the UK's power generation (mainly coal) going offline just as global supplies of gas, the easiest power source to turn on in a hurry, could be squeezed. Sam Laidlaw, Centrica's chief executive, then said he wouldn't be building more gas-fired plants until new market legislation is in place, which could take another two years. He told the FT he thinks there is a possibility of rolling blackouts by 2017-18 if there are nuclear or other outages. Is Laidlaw trying to make himself even more unpopular by refusing to invest now? Not really. It is reasonable for Centrica to want to know how the government intends the market to work before it commits. That's just how the privatised energy industry works these days, as the government knows. The rate for having gas-fired plants on stand-by, for example, is vital commercial information. Buchanan and Laidlaw may not be disinterested parties in this debate, but warnings from high places about energy shortages in three and four years' time should not be ignored. The questions for the department for energy are clear. Now that new nuclear is delayed until 2020 at the earliest, what is the contingency plan? Is there one? From Bumi to bust despite Bakrie win Shares in Bumi have fallen almost 20% in the six trading days since the board triumphed over Nat Rothschild (above) in the battle to control the boardroom. Bumi is an illiquid stock, of course, but the old theory was that victory for the board would be \"good\" for the share price in that divorce from the Indonesian Bakrie family would be more likely to happen. On this argument, a raging Rothschild at the helm would have created more uncertainty. Corporate divorces, even ones planned months ago, don't happen overnight. And a week of radio silence from Bumi is perhaps a welcome novelty by recent standards. All the same, bruised investors in Bumi might welcome some reassurance soonish that all is well with the Bakrie unwind.",

M5S has reiterated that it will not give any government a confidence vote, and PD rules out an alliance with the centre-right. An abstention is akin to a no-vote, and President Napolitano is unlikely to give Bersani, or anyone else, a mandate to form a government unless after consulting with parliamentary groups he believes there is a majority.&#xa0;</p> <h2>2) There aren\u2019t the numbers to form an alliance or a minority government.</h2> <p>In this case, Napolitano would likely resign early and a Monti/technocratic government continue in the interim. The reason for this is that a president at the end of their term cannot dissolve parliament and call elections. Parliament would then need to elect a new president. The newly elected president would at that point consult with parliamentary groups, and if s/he too cannot see a feasible majority would need to dissolve parliament and call an election.</p> <p>The strategy of the PD seems to evolve around these two options: a minority government or an election in the short-term with Bersani once again at the helm. In taking this road, I believe Bersani is flirting with fire. The PD leader is underestimating the level of support the M5S could hit in an election held in the short-term (and the implications of this) and the reasons why the PD fell short at the polls. A majority may well emerge from a new election (especially if held under a changed voting system), but it is far from certain that it would be to PD\u2019s liking.</p> <h2><strong>3) the newly elected president, in addition to exploring majorities within the current parties would likely also explore the possibilities of a caretaker government led by someone else.</strong></h2> <p>This option would buy time, which in practical terms means elections in a year or so, with different party leaders.

      "bodyText": "After a dramatic week, Italy remains far from agreement over its next government, while the latest economic news from the eurozone and the UK has alarmed investors. Here's a round-up of today's main developments: \u2022 One of the co-founders of the Five Star Movement has told The Guardian that the party, which holds the balance of power in the Italian Senate after this week's election, will not join a coalition (see 3.08pm). Gianroberto Casaleggio suggested, though, that the group could support a minority government on policies it agreed with. \u2022 Fellow co-founder Beppe Grillo was more acerbic, accusing the centre-left of acting like \"vulgar predators\", preying on M5S's senators. He also repeated his attacks on its leader, Pier Luigi Bersani, saying he was 'out of history' (see 11.50am) \u2022 For his part Bersani ruled out a deal with Silvio Berlusconi, saying a grand coalition with the centre-right was not an option. (see 8.47am). \u2022 Italy's president has urged Germany to help Europe through more expansionary economic policies (see 1.42pm). \u2022 Eurozone unemployment has hit a new record high of 11.9% (see 10.06am onwards).... \u2022 ...while the region's manufacturing sector is still shrinking, dragged down by Italy and France (see 9.32am). \u2022 This pushed the euro to its lowest level of 2013 (see 12.29pm) \u2022 The pound fell through the $1.50 mark against the US dollar for the first time since July 2010, after much weaker-than-expected manufacturing data. Analysts reckon sterling could slide to $1.40 (see 2.42pm). Hope you have good weekends, all. Thanks for reading and commenting, as ever. Goodnight! We have some fresh analysis of the political situation in Italy tonight, from @AlbertoNardelli. He sees three likely options: 1) A Bersani minority government receives sufficient support from a majority of senators. It is fundamental to understand though that a Bersani, or any government, would need to win a confidence vote - a majority is required even to install a minority government. M5S has reiterated that it will not give any government a confidence vote, and PD rules out an alliance with the centre-right. An abstention is akin to a no-vote, and President Napolitano is unlikely to give Bersani, or anyone else, a mandate to form a government unless after consulting with parliamentary groups he believes there is a majority. 2) There aren\u2019t the numbers to form an alliance or a minority government. In this case, Napolitano would likely resign early and a Monti/technocratic government continue in the interim. The reason for this is that a president at the end of their term cannot dissolve parliament and call elections. Parliament would then need to elect a new president. The newly elected president would at that point consult with parliamentary groups, and if s/he too cannot see a feasible majority would need to dissolve parliament and call an election. The strategy of the PD seems to evolve around these two options: a minority government or an election in the short-term with Bersani once again at the helm. In taking this road, I believe Bersani is flirting with fire. The PD leader is underestimating the level of support the M5S could hit in an election held in the short-term (and the implications of this) and the reasons why the PD fell short at the polls. A majority may well emerge from a new election (especially if held under a changed voting system), but it is far from certain that it would be to PD\u2019s liking. 3) the newly elected president, in addition to exploring majorities within the current parties would likely also explore the possibilities of a caretaker government led by someone else. This option would buy time, which in practical terms means elections in a year or so, with different party leaders. A caretaker government though, like a minority government, would require a confidence vote. Alberto goes on to explain some of the key factors - including why Five Star Movement might favour a new election soon. Here's the full piece: Italy - three scenarios Recommended reading: Ian Traynor, our Europe editor, on the rise of protest parties across Europe: Europe's protest parties on the march In it, Ian explains that Beppe Grillo isn't the only man winning support from Europeans who despair about the traditional political classes - from Alexis Tsipras in Greece to Nigel Farage in the UK*, via Geert Wilders in Holland, the backlash against the status quo is gathering pace. Here's a taste: Where voters have not \"kicked out the bums\", the big EU rulers have acted instead, with Berlin, Paris, Brussels, and the European Central Bank in Frankfurt conspiring to bring down elected prime ministers Silvio Berlusconi in Italy and George Papandreou in Greece. The message to the Italians from the German government this week was \"you may have kicked out our politicians, but you must not kick out their policies\". * as zippyp pointed out in the comments this morning! Two academics from Rome's Luiss Guido Carli university, Roberto D'Alimonte, professor of political science, and Giuseppe Ragusa, econometrics professor, met with my colleague Phillip Inman today. They suggested a few interesting scenarios for Italy - including president Giorgio Napolitano replacing Mario Monti as technocratic prime minister, or Monti himself staying on despite being given the order of the boot by Italians. More here. A lively week on the European financial markets has ended with most major indices falling today, led by Italy. Here's the closing prices: Italy's FTSE MIB: down 245 points at 15675, -1.5% FTSE 100: up 17 points at 6378, +0.28% German DAX: down 20 points at 7720, -0.27% French CAC: down 16 points at 3706, -0.4% Spanish IBEX: down 43 points at 8187, -0.5% America's manufacturing sector has, once again, outperformed other nations. The US ISM index jumped to 54.2 in February from 53.1 in January, which means that growth is accelerating. That's the fastest rate in 20 months, and makes the contractions in the UK (PMI of 49.7) and the eurozone (PMI of 47.9) look even worse. Amna Asaf of Capital Economics commented: US manufacturers were undeterred by the fragile recovery in overseas manufacturing activity, for now at least. Gianroberto Casaleggio, joint founder of the Italian Five Star Movement, has given an exclusive interview to the Guardian in which he states there is no chance of the group joining the country's next government. But... speaking to John Hooper, our Southern Europe editor, Casaleggio also suggests that the party could provide limited support for a minority government, on policies which M5S agreed with. Casaleggio, the man who helped mastermind the movement's rapid growth using the power of the Internet, explained: If a government is put together, formed by other parties, the Five Star Movement will vote for everything that forms an integral part of its programme. Significantly, Casaleggio also says the party will remain on the sidelines as president Napolitano tries to build a coalition over the coming days. That, John says, is a new, tougher line from M5S. Here's the story: M5S says it will not help form Italian government Definitely worth a read, as Casaleggio opens up about the party's long-term ambitions, and about how digital democracy will fundamentally reshape politics around the globe. What is happening in Italy is just the beginning of a much more radical change. It's a change that is going to touch all democracies. The pound just slipped below the $1.50 mark for the first time since early July 2010, a fall of 1.5 cents against the US dollar today. Sterling has been suffering since this morning's weak manufacturing data was released, fueling fears of a triple-dip recession. Kit Juckes of Societe Generale reckons the pound could soon be as low as $1.40. Since, as I've argued plenty of times before, a weaker pound won't really help UK exports (of planes, lawyers and investment bankers) as much as they hurt consumes' real incomes, the UK's de facto weak pound policy won't work well, so will continue for a long time. There is no other path. Italy's president has challenged the German government to do more to help the eurozone out of its economic crisis, on the final day of his trip to Germany. President Giorgio Napolitano told an audience in Berlin that Germany had shown leadership in the crisis. However, he then appeared to chide its government for not stimulating its domestic economy more vigorously to help its neighbours: Napolitano said: I don't want to simplify the problem, but it would be reasonable to expect an expansive impulse from Germany to contribute to a real, not just proclaimed, recovery in growth and employment in Europe. (quote via Reuters). Today's manufacturing data showed that Germany's factories are enjoying rising output, while most other countries are still suffering the impact of the euro recession. The Italian president also dampened speculation that the election could be rerun soon, telling reporters that \"I'm not interested in a new vote\", and that his successor (Napolitano's term ends in May) is unlikely to want more instability either. Napolitano's trip had already been marred by the diplomatic spat after the SPD's candidate for the chancellorship, Peer Steinbr\u00fcck, over his comment that two clowns had won the election. Italy has missed its deficit reduction target for 2012 - but the good news is that it didn't exceed the 3% target limit set by the European Commission. Italy's deficit came in at 3.0%, rather higher than Mario Monti's most recent forecast of 2.6%. But it still low enough for the country to extract itself from the EC's 'excessive deficit' procedure. This pushed the total national debt to a new record high of 127% of GDP. The euro has fallen to its lowest level of 2013, following the latest record unemployment levels and weak manufacturing data. The euro just dropped through the $1.30 mark for the first time since last December, to a low of $1.2987. Traders are blaming fresh fears over the health of Europe's economy, with eurozone jobless rate now at 11.9% (see 10.06am) and factory output falling sharply in Italy and France (see 9.32am) The ongoing uncertainty over Italy, following Beppe Grillo's latest attack on the centre-left (see 11.50am), isn't helping the euro either. Economist Megan Greene suggests that the solution to the deadlock in Italy could be for Bersani to step down and be replaced by Matteo Renzi, who was defeated for the leadership of the centre-left late last year. Renzi, mayor of Florence, had pledged to be loyal to Bersani - but Beppe Grillo's repeated personal attacks on the Democratic Party leader are adding to the pressure for a change. Back to Italy, and Beppe Grillo has just tried to sink Pier Luigi Bersani's efforts to become the prime minister of a minority government. In a new blog post (see it here), Grillo accused Bersani and his Democratic Party of acting like \"vulgar predators\" by trying to persuade some his Five Star Movement's new senators to work with him. Grillo pointed out that everyone who stood as a M5S candidate had agreed not to \"associate with other parties or coalitions or groups except for voting on shared points\". Grillo declared that: M5S, its elected officials, its activists, its voters are not for sale. and added that Bersani does not realise he is \"out of history\". This looks like a blow to Bersani's hopes of persuading president Napolitano that he can build a consensus with M5S (see 8.47am). The stalemate continues... Inflation in the eurozone has fallen below the 2% mark, giving the European Central Bank some leeway to cut interest rates. The consumer prices index dropped to 1.8% in February, from 2.0% in January. The ECB's goal is to have the cost of living rising by a little below 2% per year - so there's now more leeway for a rate cut... And here's each country's unemployment rate (as that picture at 10.14am is a little blurry). Eurozone: 11.9% European Union: 10.8% Belgium: 7.4% Bulgaria: 12.% Czech Republic: 7.0% Denmark: 7.4% Germany: 5.3% Estonia 9.9% Ireland: 14.7% Greece: 27% Spain: 26.2% France: 10.6% Italy: 11.7% Cyprus: 14.7% Latvia: 14.4% Lithuania: 13.3% Luxembourg: 5.3% Hungary: 11.1% Malta: 7.0% Netherlands: 6.0% Austria: 4.9% Poland: 10.6% Romania: 6.6% Slovenia: 10.2% Slovakia: 14.9% Finland: 7.9% Sweden: 8.0% UK: 7.7% As usual, the highest jobless rates are being suffered in Spain (26.2%) and Greece (27%). Austria (4.9%) and Denmark (5.3%) enjoy the lowest unemployment levels. It's official: Eurozone unemployment has hit a new record high of 11.9%, as the economic downturn forces more people out of work. That's up from a new estimate of 11.8% for December (which has been revised up). That means that 18.998 million men and women were out of work in the euro area, and a total of 26.217m people across the European Union. The statement's online here: More to follow Much gloom in the City following the news that Britain's manufacturing sector shrank in February (see 9.50am). Britain's manufacturing sector has also suffered a grim February, with Markit reporting the first contraction since last November. The UK manufacturing PMI skittered down to 47.9, from 50.5 in January. Economists had expected a rise to 51, and the pound had swiftly shed one cent against the US dollar, to $1.505. Markit warned that the manufacturing sector will be 'a drag on economic growth' this quarter, unless we see a big recovery in March. The triple-dip recession remains a risk. ...and this graph shows how German and French manufacturers are now experiencing diverging fortunes: The slump in Italian and French manufacturing output reported this morning could show the region will continue to suffer recession this quarter. The eurozone manufacturing PMI for February, which measures activity across the region, crept up to 47.9 vs 47.8 in January. That means it still shrank, despite Germany hitting growth again. Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight commented: While Eurozone economic activity appears to have bottomed out around last October, it looks highly possible that the single currency area will still suffer a fourth successive quarter of contraction in the first quarter of 2013. When we say 'record high' - the Italian jobless data goes back to 1992, so this is the worst unemployment situation in at least 21 years. Certainly since the euro was created. And another blow for Italy: its jobless rate has jumped to a new record high. Unemployment across Italy is now running at 11.7% of the population, up from 11.3% in January. The youth unemployment rate also rose to a new record high, with 38.7% of young people out of work. Rising unemployment was a big factor in the Italian election, particularly among parties arguing against Mario Monti's economic reforms. This will surely bolster their argument. We get overall eurozone jobless date in just under an hour's time (10am GMT) - and it could also be another record high (from 11.7% last month). Economic data just released shows that the Italian economy is in a bad way - manufacturing activity has fallen for the 19th month in a row, and by more than expected. The monthly PMI survey came in at a mere 45.8 for February, down 47.8 in January -- which means the country's manufacturing sector is shrinking at a faster pace [any number below 50 means contraction]. Other European economies are also reporting PMI data - and it shows that Germany continues to outperform weaker members of the eurozone. German manufacturing PMI rose to 50.3, from 49.8 in January - meaning it returned to growth. But France manufacturing sector is still shrinking, but at a slower pace (with a PMI of 43.9, up from 42.9 in January). Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the eurozone financial crisis, and other key events in the world economy. Italy remains in a state of political flux this morning. Pier Luigi Bersani, the centre-left leader whose hopes of winning this week's general election were dashed, has this morning ruled out a Grand Coalition with the centre-right. In an interview with the La Repubblica newspaper, Bersani insisted that he can become Italy's next leader without getting into bed with Silvio Berlusconi. He declared: I want to spell it out clearly: the idea of a grand coalition does not exist and will never exist. Instead, Bersani hopes to persuade Italy's president, Giorgio Napolitano, that he could govern without a majority in the Senate (having narrowly won control of the lower house). He has drawn up a seven or eight-point plan to present to Napolitano next Wednesday. Asked if his goal was to be prime minister in a minority government, Bersani said: Call it what you want: a minority government, a government of purpose, I do not care. I call it a government of change, which I assume the responsibility of guiding. The full interview is online at Bersani's web site (in Italian). With Beppe Grillo ( refusing to back Bersani in a vote of confidence, a deal with Berlusconi was the only way the centre-left could get a majority in the Senate. Some political analysts have questioned whether Napolitano would agree to a minority government, given the implicit instability. We'll find out next week.... In the meantime, the rest of Europe watches the events in Italy with interest. And one German politician has raised the possibility of the country abandoning the euro. Klaus-Peter Willsch, a member of Angela Merkel's CDU party, has even declared that Italy should leave the eurozone, rather than hold fresh elections, if a majority of the population will not support the measures needed to support the eurozone. Willsch told the \"Handelsblatt\" newspaper that: A monetary union will survive only if it benefits all of its members. It's a little early to be discussing Italy's exit from the single currency, I'd suggest - but Willsch's comments do show how much concern Italy has created. As usual we'll be tracking the action through the day....",

      "bodyText": "Bob Dudley, the BP boss, is poised to make a triumphant return to Moscow after being nominated to the board of state-owned Rosneft by the country's prime minister, Dmitry Medvedev. It is an astonishing change of fortunes for the BP chief executive, who was chased out of Russia in 2008 amid speculation in the west that the Kremlin was supporting a campaign of harassment. The nomination of Dudley, a US citizen who was chief executive of Moscow-based TNK-BP, was contained in a decree published on the government's website and was immediately declared \"welcome\" at BP's headquarters in London. BP needs a success as it fights US government charges in a New Orleans court that it acted with gross negligence during the Deepwater Horizon accident in the Gulf of Mexico three years ago. The British oil group is finalising a \u00a335bn merger with Rosneft under which the Russian group will take over BP's 50% holding in TNK-BP and subsume that business into the wider Rosneft operation, which will control 40% of the country's oil. BP will in turn be handed a 20% stake in Rosneft under an agreement still awaiting approval from competition authorities in the European Union but which is expected to be completed by the summer. The nomination \u2013 at this stage \u2013 has taken BP by surprise, but the British oil company still expects to obtain two seats on the board of Rosneft, which is run by chief executive Igor Sechin. Rosneft will not finalise the Dudley post until June at the earliest, when shareholders approve the final composition of the board at the company's annual general meeting. The merger is not without controversy because some Rosneft assets were obtained in unusual circumstances from rival Yukos, whose chief executive, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, languishes in a Siberian jail. Dudley left Moscow just under five years ago complaining about a \"campaign of harassment\" during a dispute with the other private shareholders of TNK-BP, a group of Russian oligarchs. Even on Friday BP was unwilling to reveal the secret location where Dudley holed up after leaving Russia before resurfacing in London. The billionaire Russians led by Mikhail Fridman who have since themselves sold out to Rosneft had accused Dudley of poor performance and favouring BP's interests \u2013 charges he has always denied. The TNK-BP chief executive was already having trouble renewing his visa and there were also raids on the offices.

      "body": "<p>Bankers' bonuses are like cockroaches \u2013 everybody hates them, and nothing can kill them. I wonder if they would literally, as well as figuratively, survive a nuclear war. This week, RBS has seen yet more disapprobation, for continuing to pay \u00a3600m in bonuses, having seen losses last year of \u00a35.2bn. What's any of this financial incentivisation for, you might ask, if it doesn't make sod all difference whether you make money or lose it? Brussels agrees with you: the EU agreed this week to cap bonuses at the level of the salary. The City itself appeared to be unanimously against the idea. But is this pure self-interest? Or do they have even the germ of a point?</p> <p>A number of people explained why traders get paid in bonuses. Paul Gardiner, who's now in asset management but worked at Goldman Sachs and, before that, Barings (there's a blast from the risk-desensitised past), said: \"The highest salary I ever earned [as a trader] was \u00a3120,000 a year, when I was 27, and it remained at that level. In every year I worked, my total compensation was a multiple of my salary. It's a highly cyclical activity, so that's how it has to be. Someone doing the job I used to do is probably earning \u00a3300,000 now. That's madness. That's why they're all being laid off.\"</p> <p>Belinda Lester, from the employment law firm CKFT, agreed: \"If they have a bad year, it's very difficult to cut back salaries\"; the second big plus from the bank's point of view is \"if a significant part of your remuneration is a bonus, these contracts will make it very clear that bonus is only payable if you're not leaving. Let's say they're making redundancies, or they're giving notice, or if people want to hand in their notice, they forfeit their bonus. When they're making a payment in lieu of notice, you only have to worry about the salary, you don't have to worry about the bonus.\"</p> <p>In a restaurant chain behind Bishopsgate (they've infected me with their elaborate discretion \u2013 it was a bloody Carluccio's, OK?), Tim Simons, who works in operations for a government-owned investment bank, ascribes it partly to traders' personalities. \"I don't work for a bonus, I work because I like it when the traders are pleased with me.\" (It's difficult to describe his expression, it's sort of \"ironic-craven\"). \"They're different people. The traders are getting salaries that are too high at the moment, because they're not allowed to get decent bonuses, and you can tell, because they're not hungry enough.\" This is all a relatively mechanistic argument; that they should get bonuses because it suits the fundamental nature of both the workers and the work. But it doesn't help if you think they just get paid too much, however they structure it. This is where Tim throws in the truly leftfield concept: the leftwing argument for a banker's salary. \"When a bank makes money, it either pays to its employees; or it pays to its shareholders \u2013 the wealthy, I call them.\"</p> <p>\"But aren't the employees wealthy too?\"</p> <p>\"No, traders aren't wealthy, they're just well-paid.\"</p> <p>OK, park this for a second. Breathe. \"Banks pay a lot of profit to employees, and this is a really good way to make sure they pay tax. Employees cannot avoid tax. Bonuses are PAYE. Imagine if you could tell Starbucks that they had to pay \u00a310 an hour, and they had to give workers 40 hours a week. That tax problem would immediately go away.\"</p> <p>Headhunter Richard Willis, in a coffee chain (it was a Costa) on Gresham Street, agreed with this: \"Bankers' pay may seem excessively large, but I don't think paying a proportion of the money you make to staff is a bad thing. I would like to see the sales team in a manufacturing firm make more.\" He chipped in with the sound pragmatic point: Switzerland has had a de facto cap on bonuses, of between one and one-and-a-half times salary, for ages. They get round this in different ways, sometimes paying bigger salaries, sometimes giving a person two jobs, where one is paid as a salary, and the other one held in escrow until the end of the year \u2026 a little bit like a bonus. The point is not simply that people will always find ways of paying the market rate, and politicians are unlikely to have much influence over that market; also, it's perfectly possible to attach conditions to a salary, so that it operates exactly like a bonus, except in the respect of trying to get rid of someone. Capping the bonus, in other words, just effects a pretty minor shift in the power balance between the bank and the about-to-leave banker.</p> <p>But if it's such a stupid idea, why has Brussels even gone for it? Gardiner says: \"It's irrelevant to them, they don't have any serious banks. It's just a huge poke in the eye to us.

Klein said the UK was so far behind Silicon Valley that investment banks did not even employ analysts to follow the sector. The online retailer Asos is followed by fashion analysts rather than specialist digital analysts, for instance. He was scathing about fund managers, saying: \"[They] have \u00a3700bn to invest and they have got one job, and that is to make money. Why aren't they investing in digital?\" Klein started his internet career launching the Telegraph newspaper online in October 1993. He said he could see then that structural change was necessary if the media were going to survive. He said he was optimistic about the future of media and of retail despite the challenges created by the internet. \"In fashion retail, some of the most successful companies have been created, like Zara, H&amp;M and Urban Outfitters. Retail isn't dead, it's just changing \u2013 the same with media,\" he said.",

      "standfirst": "From political stalemate to the loss of manufacturing strength and the lack of youth protest, two Italian academics find little joy in their country's current predicament", 
      "body": "<p>Talking to Roberto D'Alimonte, professor of political science at Rome's Luiss Guido Carli university, and his colleague Giuseppe Ragusa, a professor of econometrics, makes for a few laughs, but little joy.</p> <p>D'Alimonte says he's been on the phone this morning and heard tell of several different outcomes following inconclusive parliamentary elections.</p> <p>Pier Luigi Bersani, leader of the social democrat bloc, is attempting to woo the 20 senators he needs to form a majority government. Where from? His target is the large number of left-of-centre elected officials in Beppe Grillo's Five Star Movement.</p> <p>Grillo, meanwhile, is leaning towards those who believe the president, Giorgio Napolitano, should resign and make himself available to be prime minister. A Napolitano cabinet would take a more robust attitude to reforms than Mario Monti, but in the same vein.</p> <p>Then there is Monti, who, as the third choice of most people, becomes the least worst option, again.</p> <p>Ragusa says the British press have misunderstood Grillo's appeal. It is not a vote against austerity, it is a vote against the establishment and corruption. Starting as a left movement, Grillo has brought together a hotchpotch of environmentalists and social reforms as much as he has corralled Eurosceptics.</p> <p>Ragusa is pessimistic about the outcome, saying the vote has shown a deeply divided Italy \u2013 along regional lines and the generations.</p> <p>\"We need a social compact that binds the winners and losers from economic reforms. And the losers, who should be the older generation, need to accept the deal because the winners are their sons and daughters,\" he said.</p> <p>He is also worried that the engine of Italian wealth, its vast manufacturing base in the north, has lost the battle to badge its own goods and instead is a supplier to BMW and Mercedes and other well-known brands. It is also being lured abroad \u2013 even to the US \u2013 by tax breaks that mean the country will continue to haemorrhage jobs.</p> <p>D'Alimonte reflects on the lack of protest by Italy's youth. There are few demonstrations to match <em>los indignados</em> in Madrid.

      "bodyText": "Talking to Roberto D'Alimonte, professor of political science at Rome's Luiss Guido Carli university, and his colleague Giuseppe Ragusa, a professor of econometrics, makes for a few laughs, but little joy. D'Alimonte says he's been on the phone this morning and heard tell of several different outcomes following inconclusive parliamentary elections. Pier Luigi Bersani, leader of the social democrat bloc, is attempting to woo the 20 senators he needs to form a majority government. Where from? His target is the large number of left-of-centre elected officials in Beppe Grillo's Five Star Movement. Grillo, meanwhile, is leaning towards those who believe the president, Giorgio Napolitano, should resign and make himself available to be prime minister. A Napolitano cabinet would take a more robust attitude to reforms than Mario Monti, but in the same vein. Then there is Monti, who, as the third choice of most people, becomes the least worst option, again. Ragusa says the British press have misunderstood Grillo's appeal. It is not a vote against austerity, it is a vote against the establishment and corruption. Starting as a left movement, Grillo has brought together a hotchpotch of environmentalists and social reforms as much as he has corralled Eurosceptics. Ragusa is pessimistic about the outcome, saying the vote has shown a deeply divided Italy \u2013 along regional lines and the generations. \"We need a social compact that binds the winners and losers from economic reforms. And the losers, who should be the older generation, need to accept the deal because the winners are their sons and daughters,\" he said. He is also worried that the engine of Italian wealth, its vast manufacturing base in the north, has lost the battle to badge its own goods and instead is a supplier to BMW and Mercedes and other well-known brands. It is also being lured abroad \u2013 even to the US \u2013 by tax breaks that mean the country will continue to haemorrhage jobs. D'Alimonte reflects on the lack of protest by Italy's youth. There are few demonstrations to match los indignados in Madrid. He muses that maybe the Italian middle class is so wealthy, with savings based on 50 years of accumulated income, that it can cushion the blow of austerity unlike Spanish families, which were working in a largely agrarian economy until the 1970s and Franco's death. Ragusa points out that everyone in senior political positions is over 60. Contrast this situation with the period when Monti started his career. \"He was a professor at 27 and was entirely unpublished, he had nothing standing in front of him \u2013 no barriers \u2013 something that is unheard of now.\"",

    "webTitle": "Poor UK manufacturing survey adds to triple-dip recession fears", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Fears that the UK could slide into a triple- dip recession grew on Friday after a surprise fall in factory output, which sent the pound tumbling below $1.50 for the first time in more than two years. Snapshots of manufacturing from the eurozone painted a similarly grim picture, while unemployment in the currency bloc hit its highest rate since records began in 1995. The news prompted economists to predict a fresh round of stimulus measures from both the European Central Bank and the Bank of England to lift Europe's economy out of the doldrums. The UK's monthly health check of manufacturing \u2013 the first economic indicator of the month \u2013 is a fresh blow for George Osborne after Moody's stripped Britain of its triple-A credit rating. The UK economy shrank by 0.3% in the final three months of 2012, dragged down by weakness in the manufacturing sector. If output falls again in the first three months of 2013, Britain will be officially into its third recession since the financial crisis, an unprecedented triple-dip. Economists had expected the factory sector to grow in February, but the CIPS/Markit purchasing mangers' index (PMI) slid to 47.9, pushing it below the 50-mark that separates expansion from contraction. Some analysts now expect the Bank of England to expand its quantitative easing programme by \u00a325bn at its meeting next week. David Tinsley at BNP Paribas said that would be the start of a series of measures to stimulate the economy, following the arrival of the new bank governor Mark Carney in July. The UK gloom contrasted with figures from the US showing the manufacturing sector growing last month at its fastest rate in more than 18 months. The Institute for Supply Management's index of national factory activity rose to 54.2 in February \u2013 above the 50 mark indicating expansion. The report suggested manufacturing will continue to support US growth, but consumer spending is expected to fall as households feel the pinch from higher taxes \u2013 Americans' income tumbled 3.6% in January, the largest drop since January 1993. Meanwhile, tensions were rising in the eurozone after Italian president Giorgio Napolitano said Germany should be doing more to pull the region out of crisis. Speaking in Berlin, Napolitano said: \"I don't want to simplify the problem, but it would be reasonable to expect an expansive impulse from Germany to contribute to a real, not just proclaimed, recovery in growth and employment in Europe.\" Manufacturing data published on Friday showed Germany's factories are enjoying rising output, while there has been a sharp deterioration in Italy, and France suffered yet another contraction. Official data showed unemployment in the eurozone hit its highest rate on record in January, with stark regional differences. The European Union's statistics agency said 11.9% of the eurozone's workforce was unemployed, the highest percentage for the currency bloc since records began in 1995, with almost 19m out of work. Joblessness was driven higher by a surprise jump in Italy's unemployment rate to 11.7% in January from 11.3% in December, as the region's third largest economy bowed under the weight of austerity imposed by outgoing prime minister Mario Monti. By contrast, Austria had a jobless rate of 5%, while Greek unemployment hit 27% (although the latest data from Athens is from November). Inflation in the currency bloc eased to 1.8% in February, meeting the ECB's target of below but close to 2%. That could open the door to more stimulus measures from the ECB, which has been cautious about cutting rates in case it drives prices higher. Sarah Hewin, head of European research at Standard Chartered, said: \"Inflation is just not a concern, it is not a reason why policymakers would hesitate to cut interest rates.\" She said the central bank could choose to cut rates as early as next week. \"But,\" she added, \"there's an element of the ECB wanting to keep its powder dry as we enter an uncertain political situation with Italy and the Cypriot debt question to be resolved.\" Growth in China's vast factory sector cooled in February as domestic demand dipped, weighing on companies already hit by slack foreign sales. But analysts said the surveys out on Friday did not signal China's economy slipping into another slowdown. .",

The bookmakers's shares have climbed 25.5p to 430.2p after it said it would pay \u00a3424m to take full control of its online business from partner Playtech, down 18.5p at 553p. The move follows Hill agreeing to buy the Australian and Spanish operations of Sportingbet, steady at 54.75p, a deal which is due to be completed in the middle of March. Hill plans to raise \u00a3375m with a rights issue at 245p a share to help pay for the acquisition from Playtech. The two deals will transform the company by boosting its online presence and its overseas expansion. Chief executive Ralph Topping said: Having been advised of the valuation of Playtech's 29% interest, the board has concluded it is in the best interests of our shareholders to exercise our call option to assume full ownership of this attractive, high growth, high performing business. Playtech will continue as a software supplier to the venture. Topping said shareholders so far had indicated their support for the acquisition and cash call. He added: This move rounds off a successful 12 months which have seen us take our first steps in the US and ..... lay the foundations for growth in the attractive Australian market. Jane Anscombe, analyst at Edison Investment Research, said: Owning the whole of William Hill Online should propel the fast growing online business to at least half group profit by 2014. Simon French at Panmure Gordon repeated his buy rating and 436p price target: We think William Hill is paying a sensible price for Playtech's shareholding in the online business (we had estimated \u00a3408m) and the strategic rationale is compelling. The financial rationale is less compelling given the size of the rights issue which is higher than we had forecast, but combined with the Sportingbet assets acquisition we still see 2014 earnings per share around 6.6% higher at 31.1p. The company also reported a 48% rise in full year profits to \u00a3277.7m. William Hill's rise helped lift the FTSE 250 by 35.44 points to 13739.46, while the FTSE 100 is up 3.03 points at 6363.84. Capita has recovered some ground following the outsourcer's decline on Thursday following its figures, adding 20p to 843.5p. Hammerson has built up a 12.1p rise to 506.5p after it reported a 2.3% rise in net asset value a share to 542p, as it transformed itself into a pure retail property company. Profits fell \u00a3346.2m to \u00a3142.2m, in line with expectations. The company was boosted by shoppers hunting for bargains at its designer outlet villages. But Kazakhmys is down 38.5p to 580.5p in the wake of Thursday's news of a hefty \u00a31.5bn write-off on the value of its stake in fellow miner Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation, down 11.4p to 327p.",
