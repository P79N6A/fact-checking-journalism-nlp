      "bodyText": "Telstra has announced plans to cut 8,000 jobs in a major restructure. It wants to split its infrastructure assets into a new wholly owned business unit in preparation for a potential demerger, or the entry of a strategic investor, in a post-national broadband network rollout world. The new business unit will be called Telstra InfraCo. The company says it will abolish one in four executive and middle management roles to flatten its structure. Andrew Penn, Telstra\u2019s chief executive, says customers will start to benefit from its new plans as quickly as July when the company launches \u201cpeace of mind data\u201d across a range of new post-paid plans, making excess data charges a thing of the past. Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon The stock market was informed of Telstra\u2019s plans on Wednesday morning and its share price fell 7% in early trade. It has recovered dslightly but is still down 5.5% at $2.75. Telstra has roughly 32,000 employees so the plan could affect one quarter of its workforce. Penn said he understood the plan would affect thousands of staff but Telstra needed to remain an industry leader. About $50m will be set aside for a transition program for affected staff. \u201cThe rate and pace of change in our industry is increasingly driven by technological innovation and competition,\u201d he said. \u201cIn this environment traditional companies that do not respond are most at risk. We have worked hard preparing Telstra for this market dynamic while ensuring we did not act precipitously. \u201cHowever, we are now at a tipping point where we must act more boldly if we are to continue to be the nation\u2019s leading telecommunications company. \u201cIn the future our workforce will be a smaller, knowledge-based one with a structure and way of working that is agile enough to deal with rapid change. \u201cWe understand the impact this will have on our employees and once we make decisions on specific changes, we are committed to talking to impacted staff first and ensuring we support them through this period.\u201d The Communications Workers Union reacted angrily to the announcement, accusing Penn of putting short-term profits above long-term services for the community. \u201cTelstra\u2019s decision to slash 8,000 job will devastate thousands of Australian families and have a significant impact on Telstra\u2019s ability to deliver for consumers,\u201d the union\u2019s national president, Shane Murphy, said. \u201cToday\u2019s jobs purge is the low-point of 20 years of privatisation, which has consistently taken the low road of cutting jobs rather than investing in vital community infrastructure. \u201cThis is a recipe for reduced services, with Telstra\u2019s highly skilled workforce of employees and contractors replaced by casuals and piece-workers.\u201d The union is currently bargaining for a new enterprise agreement to cover the Telstra workforce. It will meet Telstra executives on Wednesday afternoon. Scott Morrison, the treasurer,has also expressed concern at Telstra\u2019s decision. \u201cI\u2019m very disappointed to learn that news,\u201d Morrison said. \u201cThere\u2019s only one thing I can say in response, it\u2019s that the government has been working hard to ensure that the economy they will go back into now, to find another job, [has] more jobs ... today than there were before.\u201d Mitch Fifield, the communications minister, says his thoughts are with Telstra\u2019s staff and he has spoken to Penn about the company\u2019s $50m transition program. \u201cIt\u2019s important to recognise that our telecommunications companies operate in a highly competitive environment that is constantly evolving,\u201d Fifield said. \u201cIt\u2019s up to each telco business to make judgements as to the best way to meet the needs of their customers and the best way to satisfy their shareholders. Telstra have determined that this is the program that they will pursue to provide the service that their customers expect.\u201d Telstra has named its strategy Telstra2022, because it is a three-year plan. It includes $2bn of asset sales and 8,000 job losses, and is expected to save $2.5bn annually. Telstra InfraCo will have its own chief executive, reporting to Penn. It will comprise Telstra\u2019s fixed network infrastructure including data centres, non mobiles-related domestic fibre, copper, hybrid fibre-coaxial, international subsea cables, exchanges, poles, ducts and pipes. Its services will be sold to Telstra, wholesale customers and NBN Co. Labor leader Bill Shorten says it is a \u201cvery tough time\u201d for Telstra staff and the company must pay them their entitlements. \u201cEverything that people have earned and deserved has got to be paid,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to make sure people aren\u2019t treated as being thrown on the scrapheap, there\u2019s a proper transition.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The Bank of England could be given a mandate to boost productivity growth under a Labour government as part of opposition plans to overhaul the country\u2019s \u201ceconomic architecture\u201d. Revealing the findings from a review of the UK financial system, the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, will on Wednesday make the case for a fundamental transformation that could include a revamp of the Bank\u2019s remit in order to help drive economic growth. Referring to the need for greater productivity across the economy, McDonnell will say: \u201cOur financial system right now isn\u2019t fit for this purpose. We need one that helps to deliver enough investment in the high-technology industries and firms so that we can reboot and rebuild Britain. This report is a vital part in making this happen.\u201d Under options being considered by the party before the next election, Threadneedle Street would cooperate with the government on meeting a productivity target, move some of its operations to Birmingham, and steer high street banks towards lending in productive sectors, such as manufacturing and IT. The proposals come amid a slowdown in business investment across the UK in the wake of the Brexit referendum. This threatens to further exacerbate the weak recovery of growth in productivity \u2013 economic output per hour worked \u2013 since the financial crisis of 2008. Productivity is considered important because if workers produce more in a shorter space of time, it paves the way for pay increases and a rise in wealth. Experts believe the failure to return productivity growth to its pre-crisis trend rate of about 2% is among the biggest factors holding back wage growth. The Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts that productivity growth, which was 0.6% last year, will only hit 1.2% by 2022. The report, compiled by the economist Graham Turner, of the consultancy GFC Economics, argues that too much high-street bank lending flows into \u201cfundamentally speculative activities\u201d rather than productive investment, making the situation worse. McDonnell will point to investment in new technologybeing concentrated in London and the south-east, and to Britain\u2019s position of having the lowest rate of investment in the G7. He will say the policies of the Conservatives have led to real wages being lower now than they were in 2010, with the UK having gone through the slowest decade of productivity growth since the Napoleonic wars ended in the early 19th century. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen more and more investment flowing into property speculation whilst hi-tech firms have been starved of the money they need, and research spending has lagged far behind,\u201d he will say. If Labour adopted the recommendations, they would represent the most radical shake-up of the party\u2019s economic policy since Gordon Brown handed control of interest rates to the Bank two decades ago. Under the plans, it would retain this remit for setting interest rates in order to steer a course for inflation towards 2%, while maintaining independence. Labour has yet to confirm whether the Bank\u2019s rate-setting monetary policy committee would have responsibility for meeting the productivity target. However, the measures could raise eyebrows among some economists, with steps for boosting productivity typically reserved for the Treasury, which is controlled by elected officials rather than senior Bank staff. There could also be questions about the best way to measure productivity, with economists debating whether the weak progress of the past decade has been overstated. Other measures suggested by the Turner review include some put forward by Labour previously, including moving parts of the Bank to Birmingham, as well as the government retaining a stake in Royal Bank of Scotland in order to boost lending to small businesses. Labour would also establish a strategic investment board to deliver productive investment, and a national investment bank to focus on lending to regions outside London.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Capita has been awarded a new contract from the Ministry of Defence to run UK military fire and rescue services despite a financial health assessment that attached the highest possible risk rating to the outsourcing company. The awarding of the contract was condemned by unions. It is the first major deal completed by the government since the collapse of the rival firm Carillion in January, which put the outsourcing of the public sector under the spotlight. Capita scored 10 out of 10 for risk in a document prepared for the MoD. One indicates the lowest probability of distress and 10 the highest. The risk assessment document was updated on 7 June, according to the Financial Times. On Tuesday Capita confirmed it had been selected for the contract, which is estimated to be worth about \u00a3500m over 10 years and involves the running of about 70 military fire stations worldwide. Shares in the company, which also announced it had sold its supply chain business Supplier Assessment Services, raising \u00a3160m, according to analysts, closed up nearly 8% at 164p, before the FT first reported the 10/10 risk assessment score. As part of the risk assessment Capita was also awarded a \u201chealth score\u201d of just three out of 100. A score of 25 or less is deemed to be in a red \u201cwarning area\u201d of heightened vulnerability. Capita beat Serco to the MoD deal, with the FT reporting that the rival bidder was judged an eight out of 10 risk. The MoD said Capita\u2019s bid was considered to be the best technical solution and the best value for money for defence. A spokesperson said: \u201cAll our suppliers are subject to robust assessments ahead of any contract placement and closely monitored throughout. \u201cThis document provides background information, using a range of statistics and figures from external sources. The ratings in question are from [financial consultants] Company Watch, not the MoD.\u201d Unite condemned the decision to award the contract to Capita. Jim Kennedy, the union\u2019s national officer for MoD workers, said: \u201cIt is absolutely scandalous that even though the MoD\u2019s own financial check found that awarding a contract to Capita was extremely risky, ministers thought it appropriate to award this contract. \u201cThe government has clearly learnt nothing from the Carillion fiasco. There needs to be an urgent investigation into how and why this contract was let to Capita.\u201d Capita came under the spotlight just days after the extent of Carillion\u2019s woes came to light, when the new chief executive, Jon Lewis, announced a plans to tap the market for \u00a3700m of investment and suspended a dividend that was worth more than \u00a3200m to shareholders last year.",

It is the first major deal completed by the government since the collapse of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/15/jobs-carillion-liquidation-construction-hs2\">rival firm Carillion in January</a>, which put the outsourcing of the public sector under the spotlight. </p> <p>Capita scored 10 out of 10 for risk in a document prepared for the MoD.

On Tuesday Capita confirmed it had been selected for the contract, which is estimated to be worth about \u00a3500m over 10 years and involves the running of about 70 military fire stations worldwide.</p> <p>Shares in the company, which also announced it had sold its supply chain business Supplier Assessment Services, raising \u00a3160m, according to analysts, closed up nearly 8% at 164p, before the FT first reported the 10/10 risk assessment score.</p> <p>As part of the risk assessment Capita was also awarded a \u201chealth score\u201d of just three out of 100.

      "bodyText": "World Cup barbecues may be under threat as beers, fizzy drinks and meat producers warn of potential shortages caused by a lack of CO2. The British Retail Consortium has written to major retailers informing them that drinks and meat supplies could be affected as at least one UK gas supplier has had to ration orders. The shortages come as many prepare to party while they follow England\u2019s progress in the football World Cup in Russia. Sales of alcohol and soft drinks are also expected to be boosted after the World Cup by what is forecast to be a long hot summer running through until August. It is understood that most drinks manufacturers hold at least two weeks stock, while retailers are likely to hold more. But retailers have expressed concerns that stocks of fizzy drinks could run short in a few days during one of their busiest times of the year. Tesco\u2019s website already showed a number of its own-label fizzy drinks were out of stock on Tuesdayand its website warned of \u201ca supply issue\u201d. Morrisons said some Sprite and R Whites products were out of stock due to \u201climited supply\u201d. One industry source said Britvic, which also produces Pepsi and R Whites in the UK, and Heineken were already being affected. Another said one small brewer, thought to be Brewdog, had also been hit. Britvic said that all of its factories remained online while Heineken and Brewdog declined to comment. Brigid Simmonds, chief executive of the British Beer and Pub Association, said: \u201cWe are aware of a situation affecting the availability of CO2 across Europe, which has now started to impact beer producers in the UK. \u201cWe will continue to monitor the situation carefully. However, given the time of year and the World Cup, this situation has arisen at an unfortunate time for the brewing industry.\u201d ABInBev, the maker of Stella Artois, Budweiser and Corona, told the Grocer trade journal that it was less exposed to disruptions in supply of CO2 because it kept its own stocks, recovering the gas from its brewing process. \u201cCurrently our supply across both our breweries is good and we\u2019re not anticipating any issue in the near future,\u201d it told the Grocer. The British Soft Drinks Association said: \u201cSoft drinks producers in the UK are taking active steps to maintain their service to customers including working with their suppliers to mitigate the impact as well as looking at alternative sources.\u201d Retailers told the Guardian that there were also fears about fresh food supplies as CO2 is used in packing fresh meat and salads, as well as in the slaughtering process for poultry and pigs. \u201cAt the moment we are looking at ways to keep the supply chain moving and we have not heard that any of our members have stopped production,\u201d said Fiona Steiger, deputy director of the British Meat Processors Association. The shortages are understood to have been caused by a longer than usual break in production of ammonia, one of the key sources of food grade CO2 in Europe. Trade journal Gas World said the UK was hit particularly hard as only one major CO2 plant was operating earlier this week and imports from the continent had been affected by shut-downs in Benelux and France. It said shortages were expected to continue throughout this month. It said well known soft drinks brands were \u201cdesperate to obtain product\u201d.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The escalation of the potential trade war between the US and China following Donald Trump\u2019s threat of new tariffs on $200bn worth of goods has sent a shudder through the markets. With Wall Street lower - and the Dow Jones Industrial Average losing all its gains so far this year - European markets have ended the day in downbeat mood. The FTSE 100 was among the better performers, helped ironically by sterling hitting a seven month low. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 fell 0.36% or 27.48 points to 7603.85 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 1.22% to 12,677.97 France\u2019s Cac closed down 1.1% at 5390.63 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 0.07% to 22,084.33 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 0.14% lower at 9755.4 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 342 points or 1.37%. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. More on Navarro\u2019s comments, from Associated Press: The White House is not planning any imminent talks with China on the trade dispute, the FT is reporting (\u00a3). Peter Navarro, a senior US trade adviser told reporters on a press call that China had been given a chance to address US complaints over the past year, and no more discussions were planned. The prospect of US mid-term elections could determine how the trade dispute plays out, with some suggesting Trump will continue to play hardball to prove to the voters that he is still putting \u201cAmerica first.\u201d But this could backfire. Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index, said: The only potential stop for Trump could be the reality of mid term elections. A large percentage of the US population are not going to be happy about paying more for imported goods. This is a long shot and still sufficient time away for damage to the markets to continue, however it could also prevent this trade war from spiralling out of control. Here are some major US companies with trade links to China: Here\u2019s our report on the market losses following Trump\u2019s escalation of the trade dispute with China: US stock markets fell sharply on Tuesday morning, following similar drops across the world, as investors feared that escalating tensions could trigger an international trade war. Donald Trump threatened to impose an additional $200bn in levies on Chinese goods on Monday evening, days after the US announced $50bn in tariffs aimed at punishing what the US administration sees as unfair trade practices. China has already said it will retaliate for last week\u2019s move and said it would escalate its response if further tariffs were imposed. Monday night\u2019s move sent global stock markets sharply lower and the Dow followed suit when it opened, dropping over 340 points (1.37%) in early trading. The S&amp;P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq also fell close to 1%. Some of the US\u2019s biggest exporters were among those most affected. Boeing dropped 3% and construction and mining equipment maker Caterpillar shed 2.7%. Tech companies, too, felt the pinch with Apple down 1.5%. The full story is here: US markets continue to fall, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average now down more than 400 points or 1.6%. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: There was no let up on Tuesday, the US open extending the disastrous trading that began on Monday. Plunging 400 points to hit a 2 week nadir, the Dow Jones was the latest index to display its abject terror at the trade war Donald Trump seems intent on provoking. The Dow\u2019s day was made worse by the strength of the dollar; though the greenback struggled against the yen, it stomped all over the euro and the pound, sending the single currency and sterling to 19 day and 7 month lows respectively. Over in the Eurozone, where political issues in Germany cut the legs out from under the region on Monday, the situation was just as nasty. The DAX shed 200 points for the 2nd consecutive session, leaving it on track for its worst close since the start of May, while the CAC lost 1.5%. It was cable\u2019s 0.6% fall that arguably helped the FTSE avoid the kind of gory losses seen by its US and Eurozone peers. Though hardly something to celebrate, the UK index\u2019s 0.5% decline was nevertheless half of its post-open drop, and roughly a third of the losses incurred elsewhere. Emerging markets are also under pressure as the fears of a trade war grow. A US tech industry group is very unhappy about Trump\u2019s planned tariffs, saying they raise prices for Americans, harm US competitiveness, and will hinder economic growth. Jose Castaneda, spokesman for the Information Technology Industry Council, said: The Trump Administration\u2019s decision to escalate trade tensions with China is irresponsible and counterproductive. We appreciate President Trump\u2019s efforts to protect the United States\u2019 \u2018crown jewels\u2019 but tariffs are simply the wrong way to do it. Tariffs will harm U.S. workers and businesses from Silicon Valley to Silicon Prairie. The White House needs to work with our allies to create lasting change with China \u2013 too many jobs and livelihoods are at stake to get this wrong. A trade war which would benefit no one may not actually happens, says Chris Payne, managing director at GWM Investment Management: Despite all this tit-for-tat posturing, an all-out trade war is unlikely to ensue because it will not benefit anybody, especially China whose economy is going through a major deleveraging process. It should also be noted that China will soon run out of US goods on which to impose retaliatory tariffs which will move this negotiation to a more sensible and constructive forum. Although as noted previously, China could slap higher tariffs than 10% if it really wanted to push back at Trump. Fears of an escalation in the trade tensions between the US and China have sent US markets sharply lower at the open. President Trump\u2019s threat to impose a 10% tariff on $200m of Chinese goods has led to new warnings from Beijing that it would retaliate. So the growing prospect of an all out trade war, and the damage that would cause to the global economy, has sent the Dow Jones Industrial Average down around 1.3% in early trading. This means the Dow has given up all its gains of the year. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite have also opened in the red. Meanwhile the Vix index of volatility hit a two week high of 14.67 before recovering to 14.18, still up 15% on the day so far. Time for a recap, as investors brace for the Wall Street open, in just over 10 minutes. Stock markets around the globe are suffering losses after Donald Trump took another step towards a trade war. Overnight, Trump instructed US officials to draw up plans for tariffs on $200bn of Chinese imports, in the latest tit-for-tat move between the two countries. Trump said he was acting because China had outlined $50bn of tariffs on US products over the weekend [a response to America\u2019s original tariffs laid out earlier this year]. China hit back, accusing the US of blackmail. The Commerce Ministry declared: This practice of extreme pressure and blackmail deviates from the consensus reached by two parties through many negotiations, and it also disappointed the international community. \u201cIf the U.S. side becomes irrational and issues the list, China will have to adopt measures that are comprehensive measures in quantity and quality in order to make strong countermeasures.\u201d The move rocked markets in Asia, sending Chinese stocks reeling to their lowest level since summer 2016. Equities in other regions also fell, as investors dumped riskier assets and economists warned a trade war would hurt growth. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 slumped by 80 points at the open, but has currently clawed back half of those losses. Here\u2019s the situation: FTSE 100: down 0.5% German DAX: Down 1.2% French CAC: down 1.1% Japanese Nikkei: closed down 1.8% Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng: closed down 2.8% China\u2019s Shanghai Composite: closed down 3.8% Commodities, such as oil, wheat and soybeans, have also fallen. There is also drama in the foreign exchange markets, with most currencies falling against the US dollar. Sterling has fallen through $1.32 for the first time since November 2017. Analysts fear that the world could be heading towards a trade war, unless the US and China can ratchet the pressure down again. Miles Eakers, Chief Market Analyst at global payments firm Centtrip, says investors are right to worry. Any retaliation by Beijing is likely to fuel the escalating trade war with Washington, which will in turn have a negative impact on equities and increase risk aversion. \u201cInvestors are not the only ones troubled by the current situation. The world\u2019s largest superpowers\u2019 shift towards protectionism has global ramifications. International companies may grow less competitive due to tariffs and the cost of raw materials purchased overseas could rise by 10\u201320%. It\u2019s highly possible that any further action from the US or China could put an end to the current 10-year bull market run.\u201d China\u2019s yuan has fallen to its lowest level against the U.S. dollar in more than five months today, as trade tensions escalated between the world\u2019s two largest economies. Reuters has the details: The yuan opened onshore trade at 6.4450 per dollar, and weakened to a low of 6.4754 at one point. It ended at 6.4743 by the official close of domestic trading in the late afternoon, the weakest such close since Jan.11. If it ends the late night session at the same level, it would have lost nearly 0.6 percent against the dollar for the day, its worst daily performance since Jan.6, 2017. Beijing controls the value of the yuan closely, which means it could use its currency to retaliate against America. A weaker yuan makes Chinese exports more attractive overseas, so could mediate the impact of tariffs. That might infuriate Donald Trump, though, who already thinks the yuan is unfairly weak..... We\u2019ve put together a Q&amp;A on the US-China trade dispute: Here\u2019s a flavour: Why is Trump imposing the tariffs? During the 2016 election campaign, Trump promised to protect American jobs and to renegotiate US trade deficits with countries around the world. The US has the world\u2019s largest trade deficit \u2013 meaning it buys more goods and services from other countries than it sells overseas \u2013 worth $568bn last year. China is responsible for the bulk of the deficit in terms of goods, exporting $376bn more to the US than it bought from US producers. Raymond Ma, portfolio manager at Fidelity International, predicts that the trade battle between the US and China will hurt company profits - which likely leads to weaker wage growth and more job cuts. Ma warns that the situation could escalate further: \u201cThe latest development suggests the recent d\u00e9tente in US-China trade talks has slipped. Indeed, recent months have seen economic relations between the world\u2019s two largest economies in a dance best characterised as two steps backwards for every step forwards. \u201cThe concern now is how China could retaliate against President Trump\u2019s latest action by increasing its own reciprocal tariffs. Such a move could push up input prices, which may prompt Chinese companies to either pass on the increased costs to consumers or allow them to eat into profits; neither outcome is favourable. Commodity prices are also sliding today. Oil is down 1.5%, sending the cost of a barrel of US crude down by one dollar to $64.87. That reflects concerns that a trade war would damage economic growth, leading to less demand for energy. US cotton and soybeans futures both fell by 2.5%, as traders calculate that American farmers could lose out badly. Last weekend, China announced retaliatory tariffs on US exports such as electric cars, soybeans and whiskey, in response to Donald Trump\u2019s original $50bn of tariffs -- a move that triggered Trump\u2019s new threat against $200bn of Chinese goods and services. The US stock market is expected to fall sharply when trading begins at 9.30am New York time (2.30pm BST). America\u2019s Dow Jones industrial average is being called down 330 points, or 1.3%, as traders react to the latest twists in the trade spat between the US and China. Craig Erlam of financial trading firm OANDA says risk aversion is rising fast: With China showing no desire to be bullied into submission, with its Commerce Ministry promising to retaliate to any new tariffs and its Foreign Ministry reaffirming that while it doesn\u2019t want a trade war, it\u2019s not afraid to engage in one, it\u2019s difficult to see how and when this ends. Moreover, it\u2019s difficult to fully grasp just how much damage will be done in the process, particularly with the European Union also drawing up counter-tariffs against the US. The clear escalation that\u2019s occurred in recent days has shaken investors and appears to brought an end to the good run that US stock markets had been on since the start of May. While Chinese stocks are faring much worse at the moment, US companies are obviously not immune to a trade war and could come under more pressure unless both sides find a solution. The US dollar has hit its highest level in almost a year, as traders scramble to protect themselves from a trade war. The US dollar index (which measures the greenback against a basket of other currencies) has gained 0.5% today to levels last seen in July. Obviously the pound is one casualty, but the damage is wide-spread; the euro is down 0.6% at $1.155, the Australian dollar is down 0.8%, the Swedish krona shed 1.4% and the Indian rupee lost 0.5%. At first glance that may seem odd; if America\u2019s economy will be hurt by tariffs, why is the dollar attractive? Answer: tariffs will drive US inflation up, forcing more interest rate rises to control the cost of living, making the dollar a higher-yielding asset. This capital flight out of emerging markets will cause serious pain. Any developing-market company which has issued debt in dollars, but earns revenue in its local currency, faces higher repayment costs. Emerging market policymakers may also be forced to hike interest rates to prop up their currencies, which will damage economic growth. Analyst group Oxford Economics has estimate that economic growth in the US and China would suffer a hit if reciprocal tariffs are imposed: They say: By threatening to impose 10% tariff on an additional US$200 billion of imports from China, President Trump has upped the ante on the trade conflict between the two. China has quickly vowed to retaliate - and if such an escalation does materialise, it would have significant economic impact on China, the US and the rest of the world, at a sensitive time for the global economy. In principle, there is still room for negotiation and we cannot rule out de-escalation in the coming weeks. But attitudes seem to be hardening. Meanwhile, deeper conflicts are also hard to resolve. Indeed, it looks like the probability of a full-blown trade war between the world\u2019s two largest economies is rising. In terms of economic impacts, we estimate that 25% US tariffs on US$50 billion plus 10% tariffs on US$200 billion worth of imports from China, with one-to-one retaliation by China, would reduce real GDP growth in China and the US by about 0.3 percentage points and 0.2 percentage points, respectively, in 2019-20. Seema Shah, Senior Global Investment Strategist at Principal Global Investors, fears that the global economy will suffer as China and the US march towards a trade war. \u201cThe latest escalation in trade tensions between China and the United States should have investors worried. Recall that the original tariffs on about US $50 billion worth of Chinese imports motivated sharp declines in equity markets, despite not being expected to have a meaningful impact on the global economy. The latest ratcheting up in the trade dispute may trigger even more severe market turmoil. After all, not only will this latest round of tariffs have a direct negative impact on China\u2019s growth outlook and the rest of the Asia region via the integration of global value chains, but China\u2019s inevitable retaliation will surely hurt the U.S. economy in turn. \u201cEmerging markets have had to contend with a long line of challenges this year. Rising U.S. interest rates, the strengthening U.S. dollar and higher oil prices have already made it a tough six months, and this lurch towards protectionism will be felt most acutely in already vulnerable emerging market economies.\u201d Several experts are warning today that the US and China are heading towards a full-blooded trade war. With Trump threatening a swathe of fresh tariffs, and Beijing vowing to retaliate, the situation is escalating fast. Professor Davide Castellani, professor of international business at Henley Business School, warns that China could hurt large American firms, potentially turning US public opinion against the tariffs. \u201cThe risk of an all-out trade war between the US and China is becoming more and more concrete. Both parties do not want to back down, because they would signal to the other party that they could use the threat of trade war in the future to further their negotiation position. However, in the long run, the US policy position may be weaker, since they are up for mid-term elections soon. When the effects of tariffs will unfold with higher prices for US consumers and possible disruptions in value chains, due to higher costs for intermediate inputs, the mood towards tariffs in the US might change. China is much less vulnerable to this threat, due to the nature of its political system. On top of this, China may resort to more \u2018qualitative\u2019 measures that could make business more difficult for US firms in China. This will put further pressure on US Congress and Administration from large US MNEs [multi-national enterprises]. Rajiv Biswas, Asia Pacific chief economist at IHS Markit in Singapore, warns that manufacturers across Asia could suffer badly from a US-China trade dispute. \u201cThe collateral damage from an escalating U.S.-China trade war will be widespread, hitting many Asian countries that are part of China\u2019s manufacturing supply chain in sectors such as electrical and electronic products. Sean Callow, senior currency strategist at Australian bank Westpac, says investors are getting anxious: We are starting to see signs of deepening market concern now that we can effectively confirm that a bilateral trade war is under way between the US and China. There seems little doubt that the prevailing mood in global markets is that investors were a lot happier with US economic policy in 2017 when it was focused on tax cuts than in 2018 when it has switched to trade protectionism. America\u2019s factory bosses fear that fresh tariffs on Chinese imports will cost jobs. Kip Eideberg of the Association of Equipment Manufacturers says Trump\u2019s latest threat is \u201cterrible news for equipment manufacturers in the United States\u201d. He also points out that consumers will pay the price too: Trade war fears and Brexit uncertainty have combined to drag the pound down to a seven-month low. Sterling has dropped by half a cent against the US dollar to $1.319, the lowest since November 2016. Other currencies are also dropping against the US dollar, as traders seek a safe-haven asset. But the pound is also suffering from political angst; UK PM Theresa May faces a fresh showdown with rebel MPs who are demanding a \u201cmeaningful vote\u201d on Britain\u2019s exit deal with the EU. Fiona Cincotta, Senior Market Analyst at City Index, says May\u2019s political challenges are hurting sterling: The dollar was one of the few assets benefiting from the Sino-US tensions and rose against a basket of currencies. The pound, however, was bogged down by domestic problems and declined below $1.32 for the first time since November. Theresa May continues to struggle to get any Brexit-related decision approved by the Parliament and a vote by the Lords is about to make her life even more difficult because it will require that the Commons approve any Brexit deal reached between the government and Brussels. Our Politics Live blog is tracking all the action: Asian tech firms who supply components to Apple have been hit hard today, due to fears that a trade war would hurt demand. Marketwatch has the details: IPhone-camera maker Cowell Holdings skidded 11.5% in Hong Kong to fresh record lows, while smartphone-lens maker Sunny Optical pulled back a further 5% and acoustics firm AAC Technologies fell 3.3%. In Taiwan, Sunny peer Largan Precision was off 5.2%. Apple product assembler Hon Hai Precision Industry dropped 2.3%. The selloff came despite a report that the Trump administration has told Apple that tariffs would not be placed on iPhones imported from China. CEO Tim Cook had told the White House that imposing tariffs against Chinese goods could hurt Apple. American consumers will feel the pain if Trump imposes 10% tariffs on $200bn of Chinese imports, as he threatened last night. As Kit Juckes of French bank Societe Generale explains, such tariffs would be paid by customers in the US: $200bn of goods represents over a third of likely 2018 imports from China. The important point to note about the escalation, which will surely result in a Chinese response, is that while the tariffs imposed may be lower on the expanded range of goods, they will include more consumer goods, and therefore have a more direct impact on US consumers apart from anyone else. Away from the political implications, these tariffs will deliver higher prices to the US and weaker growth to China. In due course we will find out how Chinese policy-makers respond Asian stocks have hit a six-month low today, Bloomberg reports: China\u2019s stock market has suffered a late rout, as investors in Shanghai shivered at the prospect of fresh US tariffs. The benchmark Shanghai composite sank by 3.8% percent to close below the 3,000 mark at 2,906.43. That\u2019s its lowest level since late June 2016. Reuters reports that speculators were badly hit by the selloff: The slump risks triggering fresh margin calls in a highly-leveraged stock market, potentially causing a downward spiral that could derail Beijing\u2019s plan to lure the listings of high-tech giants. \u201cThe market is so fragile. You don\u2019t know where the bottom is,\u201d said David Dai, general manager of Shanghai Wisdom Investment Co Ltd. \u201cIt\u2019s more rewarding watching the World Cup.\u201d Elsewhere, Japan\u2019s Nikkei ended down 1.7% while the Hong Kong Hang Seng index lose 2.8% European stock markets are a sea of red, as trade war fears ripple through the trading floors. DING DING: Shares are falling sharply in London at the start of trading. The FTSE 100 index of top shares has shed 1%, or 80 points, to 7551 - the lowest level since the start of May. The mood in the City is decidedly edgy, as traders worry that Donald Trump will trigger a full-blown trade war with China - with serious consequences for the global economy. Mining stocks are among the big fallers, with Anglo American losing 3% and Glencore down 2.6%. Technology firm Micro Focus has also shed almost 3%. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets says: Global sentiment is on the back foot amid signs that neither side will back down, potentially taking global commerce a step closer to an unwelcome trade war. It is impossible for China to retaliate in kind to Trump\u2019s new threat. That\u2019s because China imported $170bn from America in 2016 -- $115bn of goods and $55bn of services. So by threatening to impose 10% tariffs on $200bn of Chinese goods, Trump is (deliberately?) putting a tit-for-tat response out of Beijing\u2019s reach. However, China could technically impose a higher tariff on that $170bn, which would certainly escalate the situation even further. Simon Rabinovitch of The Economists explains: Donald Trump\u2019s threat has met with an immediate, chilly response from Beijing, implying that the US is losing the plot. The Ministry of Commerce in Beijing has vowed to hit back if the US actually imposes $200bn of fresh tariffs. \u201cIf the U.S. loses its senses and publishes such a list, China will have to take comprehensive quantitative and qualitative measures and retaliate forcefully. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Markets are sliding today after president Donald Trump escalated America\u2019s trade dispute with China. Overnight, Trump threatened to impose a 10% tariff on $200bn of Chinese imports, a tit-fot-tat move that could trigger a full-blown trade war. Trump is angry that China is imposing tariffs on $50bn of US imports - in retaliation to his original tariffs on $50bn of Chinese goods. He wants Beijing to back down, or else he\u2019ll ratchet up the trade dispute between the two powers. The president declared: \u201cUnfortunately, China has determined that it will raise tariffs on $50 billion worth of United States exports. \u201cFurther action must be taken to encourage China to change its unfair practices, open its market to United States goods, and accept a more balanced trade relationship. China has already responded firmly, accusing Trump of \u201cblackmail\u201d and promising \u201cstrong countermeasures\u201d if America goes through with its $200bn threat. The news has sent Asian investors reeling. China\u2019s stock market has fallen by 2.7% and Japan is down 1.7% in a wide-ranging rout. European markets are expected to slide too, with Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 called down 55 points (0.7%). Michael Hewson of CMC Markets says the City is increasingly worried about Trump\u2019s approach to trade: Things have changed overnight after President Trump upped the ante by threatening another $200bn worth of tariffs at a 10% rate on a whole new raft of Chinese goods and services, if China went ahead with their retaliation measures. This upping of the ante saw markets in Asia slide and unlike yesterday haven bond markets rallied as US treasury yields slid back, the Japanese yen gained and gold rallied. As such European markets look set to continue their losing streak and open lower.

China is much less vulnerable to this threat, due to the nature of its political system. On top of this, China may resort to more \u2018qualitative\u2019 measures that could make business more difficult for US firms in China.

      "bodyText": "Debenhams is considering selling its assets, including a chain of Danish shops, to shore up its finances after brutal trading conditions triggered a third profit warning in six months. The department store group\u2019s chief executive, Sergio Bucher, blamed falling numbers of shoppers and heavy discounting elsewhere on the high street for the fresh collapse in profits. \u201cThese are exceptionally difficult times in UK retail and our trading performance reflects that,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t see these conditions changing in the near future.\u201d Debenhams now expects annual profits to be between \u00a335m and \u00a340m, well below City forecasts of \u00a350.3m. That compares with more than \u00a3150m five years ago. Debenhams\u2019 first profit-warning came in January after a disappointing Christmas, and Bucher said trading in May and early June had also fallen short of expectations as women cut back on clothes and make-up. Debenhams shares closed down nearly 11% at 17.50p. They have lost half their value since the start of the year, when they were changing hands at 35p. The retailer has already embarked on a \u00a320m cost-cutting drive but has now upped the ante to other areas. It will spend no more than \u00a390m on capital expenditure in 2019, down sharply from this year\u2019s \u00a3140m. It is also considering selling off assets, including the profitable Danish department store chain Magasin du Nord and printing firm Magenta, to bolster its finances. There was also evidence that shoppers in their teens and 20s were having to be more circumspect with their cash. Shares in Aim-listed sportswear chain Footasylum slumped, closing down more than 52% at 80p after it said trading had suffered as a result of weak consumer confidence. The latest knocks to high street confidence come after House of Fraser announced it was shutting more than half its UK stores, including its flagship on London\u2019s Oxford Street, putting 11,000 jobs at risk. It is one of a string of retailers that are using a company voluntary arrangement, a form of insolvency, to close outlets. Others, such as Toys R Us and Maplin, have collapsed into administration in recent months, hurt by weak consumer spending and a shift towards online shopping. Bucher said Debenhams, which in April reported an 85% fall in first-half profits to \u00a313.5m, was seeking to negotiate rent reductions with landlords on 25 stores that are up for lease renewal in the next five years. He reiterated plans to close up to 10 loss-making stores and to cut the size of 30 outlets, by handing over space to restaurants and other food businesses. The chain has 241 stores, 165 of them in the UK. Bucher highlighted the tough trading conditions, with some rivals offering discounting for 10 out of the past 15 weeks, while some fashion chains were offering 50%-60% price cuts. Debenhams has also cut prices, but to a lesser extent. Like-for-like sales fell 1.7% in the 15 weeks to 16 June, while digital sales rose 16%. Clothing sales have struggled while beauty declined due to lower make-up sales, though skincare did better. Bucher, a former Amazon executive who took the reins at Debenhams two years ago, vowed to push cost savings further and to focus on its online business. The group has modernised some stores and hopes designer collaborations will help turn sales around, such as Preen \u2013 a brand worn by the Duchess of Cambridge \u2013 and Richard Quinn. On Friday, House of Fraser\u2019s landlords will vote on a plan that could result in the closure of 31 of its 59 department stores, including its Oxford Street flagship and major city stores such as Birmingham, Cardiff and Edinburgh. The two chains overlap in 18 locations with Debenhams expected to benefit from the retreat of a competitor.",

Some of the German firm\u2019s customers had already been struck in April with a stealth increase of up to \u00a350. The new price rise adds a further \u00a355 a year for a typical dual fuel customer from 16 August. However, the second rise is thought by industry sources to be limited to E.ON and unlikely to mark the start of a new round of price hikes by other suppliers. E.ON blamed higher wholesale energy costs, which it said had increased by more than a fifth since its last big price rise in 2017. Michael Lewis, the E.ON UK chief executive, said: \u201cA number of costs have risen quite sharply and in particular we\u2019ve experienced a hike in the price we have to pay for the energy our customers need, partly driven by the beast from the east and extreme weather conditions experienced earlier this year.\u201d A customer with typical energy consumption will now face an annual bill of \u00a31,208 after the rise. Victoria Arrington, a spokesperson for comparison site Energyhelpine, said: \u201cThis new rise is a bitter and expensive pill to swallow.\u201d The timing of the rise risks creating a political backlash, as the energy regulator Ofgem is bringing in the government\u2019s cap on standard variable tariffs by the end of the year.

E.ON said it was contacting customers to suggest they switch to cheaper fixed tariffs, and offering them measures to improve the energy efficiency of their homes. Wholesale power prices usually fall in summer as demand is lower. But this year they have stayed relatively high because gas stocks are being replenished after they were heavily depleted during the cold snap at the end of winter.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "What is Trump\u2019s latest tariff threat towards China? Raising the stakes in the escalating trade standoff between the US and China overnight, Donald Trump has asked US trade officials to draft plans for additional tariffs on $200bn (\u00a3152bn) of Chinese imports. The president wants them set at a 10% rate, while indicating he would be prepared to impose tariffs on yet another $200bn of imports if China were to retaliate. Has the US already imposed tariffs on China? The latest measures come on top of $50bn of tariffs approved by the White House, effective from 6 July, in retaliation to alleged intellectual property theft by China. These latest measures come as an escalation and could make it difficult for China to retaliate further, given the country only imported about $170bn of US goods and services last year. The $50bn tariffs focus on industrial sectors designed to benefit from the \u201cMade in China 2025\u201d industrial strategy put forward by Beijing, and cover products ranging from aircraft to robots and cars. The list does not include products regularly bought by US consumers, such as mobile phones and TVs. Has China retaliated? Responding to the first wave of proposed tariffs, China has drawn up a list of like-for-like tariffs on $50bn worth of US products such as soya beans, cars and aircraft \u2013 but it has yet to impose them. On Tuesday, Beijing promised \u201cstrong countermeasures\u201d should America go through with its latest threat. China\u2019s commerce ministry noted: \u201cIf the US loses its senses and publishes a new list [of tariffs], China will be forced to take comprehensive measures that are both strong in quantity and gravity and will fight back.\u201d What about tariffs on the UK and Europe? Trump is fighting trade disputes on multiple fronts. China might stand apart as the biggest target for the US president but his traditional allies are in the crosshairs for different reasons. In May, Trump announced steel and aluminium tariffs on the rest of the world in order to protect US producers \u2013 and has refused to exempt the EU (including the UK), Canada and Mexico. Each trading partner has promised countermeasures should Trump refuse to back down, while seeking to settle the dispute at the World Trade Organisation. Why is Trump imposing the tariffs? During the 2016 election campaign, Trump promised to protect American jobs and to renegotiate US trade deficits with countries around the world. The US has the world\u2019s largest trade deficit \u2013 meaning it buys more goods and services from other countries than it sells overseas \u2013 worth $568bn last year. China is responsible for the bulk of the deficit in terms of goods, exporting $376bn more to the US than it bought from US producers. What are the potential consequences for the global economy? When the first raft of Chinese tariffs were put forward, analysts believed the consequences could be contained, but now the stakes are rising and attitudes appear to be hardening on both sides. Analysts at the consultancy Oxford Economics estimate the combined $250bn of US tariffs on China with retaliatory countermeasures would lower GDP growth by up to 0.3% in both countries. The World Bank has also warned a worldwide escalation of tensions would have consequences for global trade equivalent to the financial crisis of 2008.",

      "body": "<h2>What is Trump\u2019s latest tariff threat towards China?</h2> <p>Raising the stakes in the escalating trade standoff between the US and China overnight, Donald Trump has asked US trade officials to draft <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jun/18/trump-china-tariffs-200-billion-threat\">plans for additional tariffs on $200bn (\u00a3152bn) of Chinese imports</a>. The president wants them set at a 10% rate, while indicating he would be prepared to impose tariffs on yet another $200bn of imports if China were to retaliate. </p> <h2><strong>Has the US already imposed tariffs on China?</strong></h2> <p>The latest measures come <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2018/jun/15/us-china-trade-tensions-escalate-as-trump-approves-50bn-of-tariffs-business-live\">on top of $50bn of tariffs approved by the White House</a>, effective from 6 July, in retaliation to alleged intellectual property theft by China. These latest measures come as an escalation and could make it difficult for China to retaliate further, given the country only imported about $170bn of US goods and services last year.<br></p> <p>The $50bn tariffs focus on industrial sectors designed to benefit from the \u201cMade in China 2025\u201d industrial strategy put forward by Beijing, and cover products ranging from aircraft to robots and cars. The list does not include products regularly bought by US consumers, such as mobile phones and TVs. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jun/18/trump-china-tariffs-200-billion-threat\">Trump threatens new tariffs on $200bn in Chinese imports</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>Has China retaliated?</strong></h2> <p>Responding to the first wave of proposed tariffs, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jun/15/trump-50bn-china-tariffs\">China has drawn up a list of like-for-like tariffs on $50bn worth of US products</a> such as soya beans, cars and aircraft \u2013 but it has yet to impose them. On Tuesday, Beijing promised \u201cstrong countermeasures\u201d should America go through with its latest threat. China\u2019s commerce ministry noted: \u201cIf the US loses its senses and publishes a new list [of tariffs], China will be forced to take comprehensive measures that are both strong in quantity and gravity and will fight back.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <h2><strong tabindex=\"-1\">What about tariffs on the UK and Europe?</strong></h2> <p>Trump is fighting trade disputes on multiple fronts. China might stand apart as the biggest target for the US president but his traditional allies are in the crosshairs for different reasons. In May, Trump announced steel and aluminium tariffs on the rest of the world in order to protect US producers \u2013 and has <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/31/us-fires-opening-salvo-in-trade-war-with-eu-canada-and-mexico\">refused to exempt the EU (including the UK), Canada and Mexico</a>. </p> <p>Each trading partner has promised countermeasures should Trump refuse to back down, while seeking to settle the dispute at the World Trade Organisation. </p> <h2><strong>Why is Trump imposing the tariffs?</strong></h2> <p>During the 2016 election campaign, Trump promised to protect American jobs and to renegotiate US trade deficits with countries around the world. The US has the world\u2019s largest trade deficit \u2013 meaning it buys more goods and services from other countries than it sells overseas \u2013 worth $568bn last year.</p> <p>China is responsible for the <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/balance/c5700.html\">bulk of the deficit</a> in terms of goods, exporting $376bn more to the US than it bought from US producers.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <h2><strong>What are the potential consequences for the global economy?</strong></h2> <p>When the first raft of Chinese tariffs were put forward, analysts believed the consequences could be contained, but now the stakes are rising and attitudes appear to be hardening on both sides.</p> <p>Analysts at the consultancy Oxford Economics estimate the combined $250bn of US tariffs on China with retaliatory countermeasures would lower GDP growth by up to 0.3% in both countries. The World Bank has also warned a worldwide escalation of tensions would have <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jun/05/world-bank-warns-us-trade-war-could-cause-2008-level-crisis\">consequences for global trade equivalent to the financial crisis</a> of 2008. </p>",
