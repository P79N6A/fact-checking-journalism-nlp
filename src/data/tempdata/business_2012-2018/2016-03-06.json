      "bodyText": "European finance ministers will once again deliberate over how to treat Greece\u2019s ongoing debt crisis this week despite the country desperately grappling with refugees pouring across its borders. A meeting on Monday of finance ministers from the eurozone will determine whether creditors are to be given the green light to complete a long-delayed review of Greek economic recovery plans. The review has been held up by disagreement among lenders over how much more Athens needs to cut from public spending. It is seen as key to reviving Greece\u2019s banking sector and restoring business and consumer confidence. \u201cI think the situation right now is more dangerous than it was last summer,\u201d the former finance minister Gikas Hardouvelis told the Guardian. \u201cThen it was a question of the political will of a few people,\u201d he said, referring to the tumultuous negotiations that paved the way to Athens receiving a third bailout in August. \u201cNow it\u2019s a question of implementing reforms and working hard and if a government doesn\u2019t believe in them and implements them begrudgingly, progress becomes very difficult.\u201d Monday\u2019s meeting comes at an especially sensitive time. Greek unemployment remains the highest in Europe at almost 25% \u2013 and just under 50% among the young. Many companies are relocating to Bulgaria, Albania, Romania and Cyprus as a result of over-taxation. Meanwhile, the once booming tourism trade has taken a hit as bookings to Aegean isles have collapsed because of refugee arrivals. Last week, it was announced by Greece\u2019s official statistics agency, Elstat, that the debt-stricken nation had dipped back into recession. After three emergency bailouts and the biggest debt restructuring in history, talk once again has turned to the country dropping out of the single currency. Businessmen and bankers in private concede that as the economy disintegrates the possibility of a parallel currency is now openly being discussed. \u201cThe probability of Grexit is still there,\u201d added Hardouvelis. \u201cIt has not gone away. Just look at the yield investors are required to pay on Greek bonds.\u201d Everyone agrees that time is of the essence. Further delays make potentially explosive reforms \u2013 starting with the overhaul of the pension system \u2013 harder to sell for a leftist-led government that in recent months has faced protest on the streets. \u201cWe have no time,\u201d finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos told the European parliament\u2019s economics committee last week. \u201cWe hope the IMF will become more reasonable.\u201d The Oxford\u2013educated economics professor has repeatedly said that postponement makes any plan \u201cto escape the vicious circle of measures-recession-new measures\u201d almost impossible. But the IMF, under pressure from its own member states, insists that Greece will have to implement additional measures worth \u20ac9bn (\u00a36.96bn), or 4.5% of GDP, if it is to meet an agreed budget surplus of 3.5% in the years ahead. Without debt relief or deeper cuts to the pension system, the Washington-based body does not expect Greece to be able to meet that target. While Europe wants the IMF to remain involved in the bailout programme, debt relief \u2013 even in the form of extending maturities on bonds \u2013 remains politically an anathema to eurozone lenders. Meanwhile, cuts to pensions, which have been slashed numerous times since the onset of the crisis in late 2009, are unthinkable for the government. With disbursement of aid also held up, debt due for repayment this summer has hastened the need for a solution. \u201cAs far as Greece\u2019s bailout is concerned, the bigger problem remains the ongoing disagreement between the Europeans and the IMF over the size of the fiscal adjustment necessary,\u201d said Mujtaba Rahman, head of European analysis at the London-based Eurasia risk consultancy. Any hopes that Greece\u2019s frontline role in the refugee crisis could see creditors soften their stance were quashed ahead of the meeting on Sunday when Germany ruled out giving Athens more time to achieve budget goals. \u201cThe refugee issue and the aid program for Greece should not be mixed,\u201d a spokesman for Berlin\u2019s hardline finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble told Reuters, setting the scene for the standoff to intensify in Brussels.",

      "bodyText": "Npower, one of Britain\u2019s largest energy companies, is expected to announce up to 2,500 job cuts in the UK and overseas this week after being blighted by an exodus of customers, turbulent world energy markets and embarrassing customer billing problems. The German-owned business, which is one of Britain\u2019s \u201cbig six\u201d energy suppliers, will tell staff thousands of jobs are to be axed following a series of poor financial results. Details of the job losses could be revealed as soon as Tuesday when parent group RWE releases its latest financial results. Npower employs 7,500 people directly in the UK but also has a sizable workforce overseas. In recent years it has closed UK offices and outsourced customer service work to India. It is thought a proportion of the 2,500 job cuts will come from such offshore operations. On Sunday, the company would not comment on leaked news about job losses, but dramatic changes to the business have been anticipated for some time. RWE last month slashed dividends after posting a loss of \u20ac200m (\u00a3155m) for 2015. In November, Bernhard Guenther, RWE\u2019s chief financial officer, hinted that the energy group could even end up selling its troubled npower unit, as the wider group struggled to cope with financial problems on several fronts. He said npower was unlikely to return to profit until 2017 at the earliest. RWE shareholders are understood to have questioned whether the business is worth keeping. As well as persistently low wholesale electricity prices, npower has also had to contend with the threat of increased competition from newcomers such as Ovo and First Utility. Unions reacted angrily to job cut plans being leaked to the media before staff had been informed. \u201cWe will be demanding urgent answers and assurances from npower over the coming days as we seek to protect as many jobs as possible,\u201d said Kevin Coyne, Unite\u2019s national organiser for the energy industry. A spokesman for the GMB union said npower was the third major energy firm to announce significant cuts after Centrica and EDF. \u201cMany hardworking staff have already been outsourced and so any further job losses for directly and indirectly employed staff would be another kick in the teeth for deindustrialised communities,\u201d he said. \u201cIt also makes a mockery of George Osborne\u2019s rhetoric about a northern powerhouse if an energy company can\u2019t maintain jobs in the north-east.\u201d Shares in RWE, which is listed on the Frankfurt stock exchange, have more than halved in the last year. Its chief executive, Peter Terium, noted that investors had been particularly frustrated by embarrassing billing mistakes at npower. Some British households had reportedly received multiple bills for varying amounts, not matched to meter readings. In other instances the names on bills have been incorrect, or bills have been arriving late or not at all. Npower\u2019s financial performance was also hit last year by lower UK energy consumption and higher grid fees. Last August, RWE said npower\u2019s profit for the first six months of 2015 had fallen by almost two-thirds to \u00a338m. Npower boss Paul Massara quit later that month. In a trading update in November, RWE said npower had lost about 200,000 customers in Britain since the start of 2015. In December, npower was fined \u00a326m for sending out late and often inaccurate bills and failing to handle customer complaints effectively. Watchdog Ofgem said more than 500,000 customers had been affected.",

    "webTitle": "The innovators: portable solar panels that can be unrolled like a carpet", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Talk is not cheap in the mountains of Nepal. Getting a mobile phone charged can cost $5 in areas where there is no electricity and backpackers have to rely on diesel generators used by locals to power up. John Hingley had a solution stuffed in his rucksack: a thin and lightweight portable solar panel that unfolded and could generate enough energy to power his phone, camera and computer. As well as keeping him charged in the mountains, the simple device commonly used by travellers and outdoor enthusiasts gave him an idea - to make a much bigger version. \u201cThe reason why this worked so well was because of the big surface area that you have got ... and I started working on ways to scale this sort of concept,\u201d he said. Three years after returning from his world trip, Hingley has developed a large steel container that contains a long spool of solar panels, all attached together on a strong flexible fabric that can be pulled out into a 50 metre long system in two minutes. The portable carpet-like solar system, which stores generated energy in batteries in the steel housing, is expected to be used for disaster relief where power systems have been knocked out, by armies on the move, and in mining stations located in areas without any power. \u201cThe market for off grid energy is huge and growing - 24% of the world is off grid but everyone needs energy these days,\u201d said Hingley. The system uses copper indium gallium selenide solar cells (CIGS) that are bonded with a tensile fabric. The strength of the combined material can cope with being rolled in and out, said Hingley, and it can be in full operation a few minutes after it is deployed. \u201cIt is like a microgrid in a box. It has all of the components integrated into it that you need to run a 24 hour microgrid.\u201d The spool of solar panels is typically pulled out by a vehicle, which takes about two minutes, but can also be done manually, albeit by a number of people. When ready for market, after it goes through regulatory checks, Hingley\u2019s company Renovagen will make the solar power systems bespoke, according to what size the buyer wants. The surface it is placed on does not have to be flat, he said. An initial prototype had a capacity of 6KW, about twice that of a solar array on a typical family home. The current generation will have a capacity of up to 18KW, said Hingley, and similar levels of efficiency to solar systems sold for homes in the UK. However, since they may be used in countries where the demand for energy is much less, the Renovagen system will be able to serve many more homes than a comparable solar array in Britain, he said. The steel unit in which the spool of panels is housed has lifting rings on the top which can be attached to helicopters so that the unit can be dropped by air. When the Philippines was hit by Typhoon Haiyan in 2013, Tacloban City was cut off from supplies and while hospitals had diesel generators, there was no diesel to fuel them. It is occasions like that where the Renovagen system could have been used to best effect, said Hingley. \u201cI could see that if we could drop this on the ground at the beginning, right after the disaster, then it could have powered all of that equipment in the hospital,\u201d he said. A second market is for the military, and specifically for forward operating bases where fuel is sometimes, in the case of remote operations, being flown in. The protection of fuel convoys has resulted in large numbers of military deaths, Hingley said. \u201cYou have to protect the convoys, you have to protect the flights going in, so it can cost. The US army estimated that it can cost up to $400 per gallon to deliver fuel to those bases.\u201d Mining companies which may be exploring in specific areas for short periods at a time, and need to be able to up and move, are also potential customers, he said. \u201cYou might only be at a particular site for a few weeks and then you might move a few miles [and] be on that next site for a few weeks. And all of that might be so remote that you would have to fly fuel in for the diesel generators that you would be running.\u201d So far, Renovagen has received orders for three prototype systems from an unnamed client. Hingley expects them to get full regulatory approval in four months so they can start to make and sell them on the market. The early versions can cost between \u00a350,000 and \u00a3110,000 although he expectsthe price to drop substantially as the business grows and the cost of solar and battery components comes down. The company is targeting sales in markets where there is a need for off-the-grid power, such as the United States, Canada and the Middle East. Hingley also hopes to attract interest from Chile, where there is a large mining industry. Other possible uses could be at festivals and in filming, where quiet energy generation is needed, he said. Future plans are for a much larger-scale solar power unit, which will be the size of a shipping container but will have a capacity of up to 150KW across an array measuring 5 metres wide and 200 long.

      "body": "<p><br><br>Talk is not cheap in the mountains of Nepal. Getting a mobile phone charged can cost $5 in areas where there is no electricity and backpackers have to rely on diesel generators used by locals to power up.</p> <p>John Hingley had a solution stuffed in his rucksack: a thin and lightweight portable solar panel that unfolded and could generate enough energy to power his phone, camera and computer. As well as keeping him charged in the mountains, the simple device commonly used by travellers and outdoor enthusiasts gave him an idea - to make a much bigger version.</p> <p>\u201cThe reason why this worked so well was because of the big surface area that you have got ... and I started working on ways to scale this sort of concept,\u201d he said. Three years after returning from his world trip, Hingley has developed a large steel container that contains a long spool of solar panels, all attached together on a strong flexible fabric that can be pulled out into a 50 metre long system in two minutes.</p> <p>The portable carpet-like solar system, which stores generated energy in batteries in the steel housing, is expected to be used for disaster relief where power systems have been knocked out, by armies on the move, and in mining stations located in areas without any power. \u201cThe market for off grid energy is huge and growing - 24% of the world is off grid but everyone needs energy these days,\u201d said Hingley.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4edfdc1524360f5c29ba621c5bdf96687f934b76\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4edfdc1524360f5c29ba621c5bdf96687f934b76/0_306_6144_3682/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rollable solar panels\" width=\"1000\" height=\"599\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The 50 metre long solar panel is rolled up in the back of a trailer.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felix Clay for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The system uses copper indium gallium selenide solar cells (CIGS) that are bonded with a tensile fabric. The strength of the combined material can cope with being rolled in and out, said Hingley, and it can be in full operation a few minutes after it is deployed. \u201cIt is like a microgrid in a box. It has all of the components integrated into it that you need to run a 24 hour microgrid.\u201d</p> <p>The spool of solar panels is typically pulled out by a vehicle, which takes about two minutes, but can also be done manually, albeit by a number of people. When ready for market, after it goes through regulatory checks, Hingley\u2019s company <a href=\"http://www.renovagen.com/\">Renovagen</a> will make the solar power systems bespoke, according to what size the buyer wants. The surface it is placed on does not have to be flat, he said.</p> <p>An initial prototype had a capacity of 6KW, about twice that of a solar array on a typical family home. The current generation will have a capacity of up to 18KW, said Hingley, and similar levels of efficiency to solar systems sold for homes in the UK. However, since they may be used in countries where the demand for energy is much less, the Renovagen system will be able to serve many more homes than a comparable solar array in Britain, he said. The steel unit in which the spool of panels is housed has lifting rings on the top which can be attached to helicopters so that the unit can be dropped by air.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Renovagen roll-array solar panels\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/145871430&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;281&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://vimeo.com/145871430&quot;&gt;Renovagen Roll-Array Multi-Gen&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;https://vimeo.com/user29757952&quot;&gt;John Hingley&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;https://vimeo.com&quot;&gt;Vimeo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> <figcaption>Renovagen roll-array solar panels.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>When the Philippines was hit by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/typhoon-haiyan\">Typhoon Haiyan</a> in 2013, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/11/reports-towns-typhoon-haiyan\">Tacloban City was cut off from supplies</a> and while hospitals had diesel generators, there was no diesel to fuel them. It is occasions like that where the Renovagen system could have been used to best effect, said Hingley. \u201cI could see that if we could drop this on the ground at the beginning, right after the disaster, then it could have powered all of that equipment in the hospital,\u201d he said.</p> <p>A second market is for the military, and specifically for forward operating bases where fuel is sometimes, in the case of remote operations, being flown in.<br></p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-09-30/exploding-fuel-tankers-driving-u-s-army-to-solar-power\">protection of fuel convoys has resulted in large numbers of military deaths</a>, Hingley said. \u201cYou have to protect the convoys, you have to protect the flights going in, so it can cost. The US army estimated that it can cost up to $400 per gallon to deliver fuel to those bases.\u201d</p> <p>Mining companies which may be exploring in specific areas for short periods at a time, and need to be able to up and move, are also potential customers, he said. \u201cYou might only be at a particular site for a few weeks and then you might move a few miles [and] be on that next site for a few weeks. And all of that might be so remote that you would have to fly fuel in for the diesel generators that you would be running.\u201d</p> <p>So far, Renovagen has received orders for three prototype systems from an unnamed client. Hingley expects them to get full regulatory approval in four months so they can start to make and sell them on the market. The early versions can cost between \u00a350,000 and \u00a3110,000 although he expectsthe price to drop substantially as the business grows and the cost of solar and battery components comes down.<br></p> <p>The company is targeting sales in markets where there is a need for off-the-grid power, such as the United States, Canada and the Middle East.

    "webTitle": "Wage growth, the fatal flaw in George Osborne's economic storyline", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Before Christmas, George Osborne was riding high, armed with the \u00a327bn of extra cash thrown his way by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) and its optimistic forecasts for growth and tax receipts. He was supposed be greeted with a cry of Hail, Caesar! when he arrived in the House of Commons to deliver his second budget of the parliament. How the mighty can find themselves kidnapped by events. On 16 March, the chancellor will find that the sunny economic uplands are further away and his target of a budget surplus in 2020 is more difficult to achieve. He will cast himself as a victim of circumstance, just like movie studio boss Eddie Mannix, played by Josh Brolin in the Coen brothers\u2019 latest film, Hail, Caesar!, who is busy patching together an unstable group of actors only to see his star snatched and film project jeopardised. Osborne\u2019s speech will stress that Britain\u2019s recovery has come under severe stress from yo-yoing share prices, a slowdown in China, a slackening of growth in the eurozone and a dip in the performance of the usually sparkling US economy to cope with. These are the storm clouds and cocktail of threats he has warned about over the last couple of months. What he will avoid talking about is how the star of the recovery, a long-awaited rise in real wages towards the previous average 4%, has disappeared. A report last week showed that the peak in real wages growth of 3.4% seen last summer has declined to nearer 2% and is not coming back soon. And by soon they mean in the next couple of years. It will stay at the current sluggish rate, for at least the rest of the year and most likely well beyond. And that\u2019s important because both the Bank of England and the OBR, which is the Treasury\u2019s independent forecaster, have predicted that tax revenues will keep on rising following a surge in wages to 4.25% by 2018. David Blanchflower and Stephen Machin,in a report for the London School of Economics\u2019 Centre for Economic Performance, don\u2019t rule out a return to 4%-plus wage rises at some point. It was the norm before the 2008 banking crash and could be the average again. And there is an argument that wages must recover as long as unemployment keeps falling and vacancies pushes to new highs. Yet a closer look at the employment scene of the last few years indicates, as Blanchflower and Machin argue, that the OBR and Bank of England are way off beam. It might be a generalisation, but neither the output nor employment of the manufacturing sector has regained the levels seen before crash. Outside the car industry, aerospace, pharmaceuticals and the big engineering firms, the prospects are fragile. So it wasn\u2019t a surprise when the manufacturers\u2019 lobby group, the EEF, reported that employers have been restricting pay rises to 2% in recent months. A construction boom between 2013 and 2015 fed into higher wages, as skills shortages pushed up rates for skilled staff. But building firms make up only 6% of the economy, so its impact was only slight. It has been left to the services sector, which accounts for 80% of employment, to be the bedrock of employment growth and mostly in areas like hospitality. This is where the baby boomers, who in the main weathered the recession better than most, have been spending their spare cash. When they are not buying cars and home extensions, they are taking weekend breaks, going out to a local restaurant and booking their next gym class. Unfortunately, from the perspective of wages, this is an industry prone to employing staff on the minimum wage and zero-hour contracts. Another area of expansion is transport, which is where so many of the newly minted self employed are working, whether as Uber drivers or delivering parcels for the growing number of online-only shops. This is the unbalanced recovery that is mostly of Osborne\u2019s making, in that he has chased away the long-term investment that might have provided a more stable and resilient base with his constant scare tactics. From the moment he took office it has suited his political agenda to promote fear, mainly of the UK turning into Greece, when the economic situation clearly needed a government that exuded confidence and optimism. Austerity, which is justified by fear, is the reason businesses have proved so reluctant to invest. Even now we have the strange situation of those politicians who are most in favour of austerity, like Iain Duncan Smith, who back Osborne to the hilt with his scare stories of economic vulnerability, arguing that Britain is a major trading nation that should have the confidence to leave the EU and make its own way in the world. At least there is more consistency to Osborne\u2019s position, though on the economy it is still wrongheaded. Blanchflower and Machin point out that the Bank of England\u2019s own staff are sceptical of a return to higher wages growth any time soon. Writing on Threadneedle Street\u2019s Underground Blog, launched last year, staff said: \u2018In our view it is striking how stable the scores for pay growth have been over recent years at modest levels, consistent with private sector settlements reported to the agents of around 2-3%.\u201d A broader measure of growth of total labour costs, which includes bonuses, commissions and pension costs, were, they reported, somewhat higher, \u201cbut also point to pretty modest growth, at rates below those that prevailed before the financial crisis\u201d. Without wages growth to boost consumption and tax receipts, the OBR will need to trim Osborne\u2019s budget outlook next week. And that will force the chancellor to make extra cuts or fall back on stealth tax rises, as he did last year. Not that he should be surprised. The situation is largely of his own making. He wants a precarious workforce, scared of its own shadow, reluctant to ask for a pay rise. He is also the reason for lacklustre business investment all the time it serves his purpose to keep up the scare tactics, now deemed useful in the anti-Brexit campaign, that make businesses reluctant to invest in higher-wage, skilled jobs. There is the new \u201cnational living wage\u201d coming into force in April. But all the evidence is that employers are looking at ways to claw back the extra 50p an hour by employing more under-25s, who don\u2019t qualify, and forcing their staff, to pay for their own uniforms and replace the kettle when it breaks or miss out on tea in their five-minute break.",

      "bodyText": "This article is the subject of a legal complaint from lawyers for Retail Acquisition Ltd. The competition watchdog will on Thursday announce remedies aimed at addressing the dominance and excessive profits of the big six energy suppliers in the UK retail market. But the Competition and Markets Authority is set to yield to lobbying by the big six and drop plans for a safeguard price cap and, probably, lift a ban on multiple confusing tariffs. It has already turned its back on demands to break up these large utilities. While it\u2019s true that the big six have severely distorted the retail market, their biggest crime will not be mentioned anywhere: that they have been acting as a massive brake on work towards modernising and decarbonising Britain\u2019s power sector. In Germany, politicians have seized the initiative on behalf of their citizens by introducing the Energiewende \u2013 energy change \u2013 to fast-track the country into a low-carbon era. They ignored the critical screams from their (and our) utility companies, including RWE and E.ON. In Britain these utilities have for decades used their financial and political muscle to keep their vested interests and fossil fuel assets in place. The CMA should have gone ahead with breaking up Centrica, SSE and the rest \u2013 not because it would have had a dramatic impact on immediate prices, although it would have helped, but because it would undermine their power base. And big six should really read big seven, because the National Grid, too, is stuck in the past and frightened of the future, just as the lights are in danger of going out because of a lack of new investment. The grid is also compromised by the twin jobs it has been allowed to carry on doing: balancing power demand and supply; and running an energy transmission business. All of this is an extra problem at a time when an ideologically driven Conservative government has been undermining investor confidence in wider energy sector with a series of policy U-turns or attacks on solar and wind power. Ministers seem to feel that the only thing that stands between us and blackouts is desperate bungs of cash to the big six to keep their gas or coal-fired power stations running a bit longer. The only new power stations energy secretary Amber Rudd seems determined to pursue are nuclear, but even the first proposed one \u2013 at Hinkley Point in Somerset \u2013 is much delayed and dependent on a yet-to-be agreed French financing package for EDF. But amid all that gloom there came a glimmer of hope at the end of last week, courtesy of the National Infrastructure Commission in a report for the Treasury. The report, entitled \u201cSmart Power\u201d, says what this newspaper, many energy experts and businesses without legacy fossil fuel interests have long been saying: you do not need to build that much new power capacity if you put more emphasis on reducing demand. Lord Adonis, the former Labour peer who heads the commission, says managing demand, combined with improved energy storage and the use of interconnectors to hook up supply from abroad, could save consumers up to \u00a38bn a year by 2030. \u201cWe do not call for new subsidies or significant public spending,\u201d he said, \u201cbut rather a level playing field through fairer regulation and a better-managed network, to allow these exciting new technologies to compete.\u201d Demand flexibility in Britain currently is below 1%, while in some parts of the US, thanks to smart metering, it is as high as 15%. Such plans will do nothing for British Gas and the rest, but they will do everything for British consumers. Transformation can come quickly. Let\u2019s get on with it. Brazil\u2019s corruption crackdown is welcome The arrest of former Brazilian president Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva could mark the beginning of the end of a political and financial crisis that has ensnared politicians and plunged the economy into recession. Lula, who served for eight years until 2011, is accused along with many others of siphoning cash from the government-owned oil firm Petrobras and spending some of that money on bribes and electoral campaigning. One line of inquiry in Lula\u2019s case concerns construction companies giving him preferential terms in the development of a ranch and a luxury beachfront apartment. The accusations may not be true \u2013 Lula certainly denies them \u2013 but the point is that the allegations will be aired and investigated, with the possibility he could go to jail. This, together with the recent arrest of a billionaire Brazilian banker, is enough to tell the world that the rule of law operates in Brazil and wrongdoers will be apprehended. Markets in Brazil reacted strongly to the news of Lula\u2019s arrest, and the Brazilian real surged. S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s main stock exchange index rose more than 4% last Friday. Among Bric countries, China and India are also making a show of rooting out corruption. Beijing has made countless arrests as it tries to tackle construction scams and pyramid selling in the financial sector. But the suspicion must be that the politburo works on favours, as it ever did. Narendra Modi\u2019s India, while growing quickly, remains riddled with uninvestigated corruption scandals. Russia? Enough said. Investors looking at Mint countries \u2013 Mexico, Indonesia, Nigeria and Turkey \u2013 must also be wary. Mexico is trying to rid itself of corrupt practices, and Turkey\u2019s sizable middle class is resisting the fear tactics of its president. But these countries could fall back on the old certainties. Corruption is one barrier to investment that all these countries must tackle. In the short term Britain, considered a safe haven, benefits from this. But fears over corruption limit global economic development, which hurts us all. No way to rebuild BHS Sir Philip Green sold BHS for \u00a31 a year ago this week. That may turn out to be a great deal for the billionaire retail tycoon. The new owners of BHS last week revealed their dramatic turnaround plan \u2013 demanding that landlords reduce the rent on half of its stores and cutting hundreds of jobs. This is a make-or-break moment for BHS. The loss-making chain desperately needs to cut costs so it can fund a modernisation of its increasingly tired-looking shops. But BHS has got off on the wrong foot by trying to pin the blame for store closures \u2013 which are inevitable \u2013 on landlords who refuse to reduce rents. BHS\u2019s cause has now been further undermined by the news that, in March 2015, its owners took an \u00a38.4m loan out of the business. If BHS is to survive and thrive, it needs all the funds and help it can get. Alienating its landlords en masse and borrowing large sums from the business are not the answer. This article was amended on 6 and 9 March 2016 to make clearer that the \u00a38.4 million loan was taken out in March 2015 and further amended to remove an incorrect referenceto the National Grid and Scotland.",

Paddy was once very funny indeed, pulling stunts like offering 100,000-1 on Pope John Paul II being the next signing at (typically Protestant) Glasgow Rangers, and then refunding punters when the pontiff picked up a niggle after slipping in the shower. However, the merger now means that the combined betting business is worth more than \u00a38bn \u2013 so probably a bit grown-up for stunts like that. It may also be timely to appear more serious, seeing as Paddy seems to have misplaced its sense of humour of late, Betfair never had one in the first place, and rivals trying to emulate the old Paddy-style jokes look very tired. Kaye knows all about that: he was notably not funny any more in the tiresome ads run by Paddy\u2019s rival, BetVictor. G4S tries to stay out of trouble in results week This page has long been in awe of the ability of G4S to turn security work into farce \u2013 particularly just before it makes announcements to the City. Few in the Square Mile tire of hearing about pre-results gaffes that have included a guard routinely taking a break after parking his security van outside a customer\u2019s store before venturing inside to collect the takings, a pattern that allowed an impostor to don a G4S uniform and make off with \u00a314,000 from the store\u2019s tills; and (best of all) a prisoner tricking his G4S guards into tagging his prosthetic leg, thereby allowing him to skip his curfew by detaching the limb. Still, last autumn G4S reckoned it had retired from vaudeville and dispatched a smart new PR team around London to tell critics all about its newfound professionalism. It was a convincing pitch \u2013 not least because maintaining such high-quality comedy over several years is a challenge for anybody. But when you employ more than 623,000 people, disaster is often lurking. So rather than an incident-free run-up to its 2015 results this week, there\u2019s controversy (though not of the amusing kind) at Medway secure training centre and a spat with the SNP. The Easter egg stories sound pretty hollow Apparently, there might be the odd cynic who doesn\u2019t believe all the stories we\u2019re told about Easter. Some might question the resurrection, others wonder if the Easter bunny really exists, but surely we can all agree that one tale is so obviously true that nobody need ever doubt it. It is, of course, the annual shortage of Easter eggs. On Friday the hunt for these precious treats kicked off again \u2013 with a yarn explaining how this year\u2019s production might be disrupted by 200 striking Cadbury workers. Expect follow-ups this week about other factors set to contribute to a dearth this year, including tales of cocoa shortages, production blips and, probably, something about the Easter bunny being so frustrated by EU red tape that he\u2019s relocating to Switzerland. That would hardly be farther-fetched than previous years\u2019 headlines, including: \u201cEaster egg prices jump by up to 200% in just a year\u201d (Daily Mail, 2013); \u201cEaster egg shortage at the supermarkets\u201d (Daily Telegraph, 2014); and \u201cEnjoy today\u2019s Easter eggs: they could soon become a luxury\u201d (the er, Observer, 2015). It may be that supplying Easter eggs is so complex that it\u2019s impossible to learn from previous errors. Or it could \u2013 just possibly \u2013 all be a marketing wheeze.",
