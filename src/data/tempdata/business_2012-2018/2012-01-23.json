      "body": "<p>Leading shares reached their highest level for nearly six months on optimism that Greece is edging closer to an agreement with its private bondholders.</p> <p>Although no Greek deal has yet been agreed, investors took comfort from signs that EU officials and the IMF - despite continued differences - could yet come up with a resolution to the eurozone debt crisis. A couple of reasonable bond auctions from France and Germany also helped sentiment. So the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> finished 54.01 points higher at 5782.56, its best since 29 July last year.</p> <p>Angus Campbell, head of sales at Capital Spreads, said:</p> <blockquote> Optimism that a default by Greece can be averted is increasing and this is fuelling the bullishness in equity markets. European politicians have started off the New Year with lots of rhetoric stating that they remain committed to sorting out the sovereign debt crisis and as we head towards the next European summit at the end of this month investors seem more and more inclined to expose themselves to stocks. <br> The market's eyes remain glued to the fortunes of the euro which saw the single currency make impressive gains and as a result other risk assets were in favour. Banking stocks did particularly well as the deal in Greece is expected to be finalised and once that issue is out of the way, European political leaders can focus on the next stage of repairing the crisis, which is growth. </blockquote> <p>The French and German markets both rose around 0.5% while Italy added nearly 1.8%. The euro rose to three week highs against the dollar, touching $1.3037, as French finance minister Francois Baroin said a deal with Greece's private bondholders was taking shape, while his German equivalent Wolfgang Schaeuble said he wanted a second bailout programme for Greece to be in place by mid-March. But suggestions after the European markets closed that the EU and IMF had no intention of giving more money to Greece saw Wall Street slip back from its early gains.</p> <p>Attention could also turn back to the US, with the latest Federal Reserve meetings. Kathleen Brooks at Forex.com said:</p> <blockquote> Assuming the Greek issue doesn't implode overnight then the next few days could be more Fed focused. The Federal Reserve meet on Wednesday and releases its first ever set of interest rate projections. </blockquote> <p>Miners moved higher after new figures showed global steel production rose 6.8% last year, with China up 8.9%. Although the pace of growth slowed, analysts were encouraged by the fact there was any growth at all. Hopes for the Greek debt talks also lifted copper and other commodities.</p> <p>So <strong>Rio Tinto</strong> rose 51.5p to \u00a337.36, while <strong>BHP Billiton</strong> was 33.5p better at \u00a321.59. <strong>Vedanta Resources</strong> added 32p to 311.78 after the completion of its purchase of the bulk of <strong>Cairn Energy</strong>'s Indian business. Cairn climbed 1.6p to 292.2p as its agreed to farm out part of its Greenland licence to Statoil. Cairn said:</p> <blockquote> Statoil's extensive Arctic operating and development experience makes them the partner of choice for the Pitu block where we see significant potential. </blockquote> <p>Lower down the market, <strong>Rockhopper Exploration</strong>, the Falklands group, rose 17.75p to 340.25p on continuing hopes a major group will take a stake in its operations or perhaps make a takeover bid. Cairn has been mentioned as one possible partner, and US group Anadarko seems to be the current favourite. Analyst Brendan Long at Merchant Securities said:</p> <blockquote> We believe that Rockhopper's assets are of the same geological family as Anadarko's assets on the East Coast of Africa. We are therefore not surprised that Anadarko is taking a serious look a Rockhopper. It is possible that companies are currently considering to either enter the data room (and sign confidentiality agreements which could limit a takeover of Rockhopper) or to make a pre-emptive bid for the entire company due to its attractive valuation. </blockquote> <p><strong>Essar Energy</strong>, which was hit hard by last week's news it had come off worse in a dispute with the Indian tax office, recovered 13.1p to 135.6p. The power group increased the estimated reserves at its Raniganj coal bed methane exploration block in West Bengal from 201bn cubic feet in December 2009 to 445bn cubic feet.</p> <p>But <strong>Afren</strong>, the Africa-focused oil firm, lost 6.7p to 117.9p after its 2011 production figures and forecasts for the current year both missed City expectations. Oriel Securities said:</p> <blockquote> Production in 2011 averaged 19,000 barrels of oil equivalent (versus our estimate of 21,000) and production is now expected to average 42,000-46,000 in 2012 (versus our estimate of 56,000). At this stage it is unclear where the differences in production come from for 2012, but looks most likely to be due to [Nigerian oil field] Ebok. </blockquote> <p><strong>Prudential </strong>put on 22.5p to 716.5p as analysts turned positive about its Asian business following reports that rival insurer AIA was interested in a $6bn purchase of ING's operations in the area. Analysts at RBS repeated their buy recommendation on Prudential, with a 900p price target. They said:</p> <blockquote> M&amp;A interest in ING's Asian operations reinforces the attraction of the region, with low levels of market penetration and strong GDP growth forming a stark contrast to more challenging conditions in Europe. <br> With fast-growing and cash-generative Asian businesses, Prudential is extremely well placed, in our view, to benefit from these trends. With 55% of its 2012 new business profits expected to be generated in the region, Prudential's valuation appeal is closely linked to the outlook for Asia. </blockquote> <p><strong>BAE Systems</strong> soared 8.8p to 322.5p as Barclays Capital raised its rating from equal weight to overweight. Its analysts said:</p> <blockquote> We see a number of near-term positive catalysts, including: potentially winning the Indian fighter jet competition, stronger-than- expected Cyber growth, and potential for further buybacks to be announced with its 2011 results. We increase our BAE share price target to 370p [from 340p]. </blockquote> <p>Elsewhere <strong>Weir</strong>, the pumps and valves maker, led the FTSE 100 fallers, down 70p to \u00a318.84 after JP Morgan moved from overweight to neutral. Its shares have been weak recently on worries about demand for its equipment from the shale gas industry, where analysts are questioning future rates of growth.</p> <p><strong>IMI</strong> was close behind, falling 22.5p to 855p after UBS cut its rating on the engineering group from buy to neutral and its price target from 950p to 900p. Analyst Stephen Swanton said:</p> <blockquote> We think the 4% organic growth IMI saw in the third quarter deteriorates further into 2012, making it more difficult to keep the margins trending up. </blockquote> <p><strong>Ocado</strong> - which moved sharply higher on Friday on <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/marketforceslive/2012/jan/20/ocado-bid-talk-ftse-fades\" title=\"\">vague takeover speculation </a>- dipped 2.05p to 85.6p after the online grocer announced finance director Andrew Bracey was leaving the company to join recruitment group <strong>Michael Page International</strong>, down 0.9p at 401p, in the same role. He is expected to leave in April and Ocado has started looking for a successor.</p> <p>A fall in French business confidence in January, compared to expectations of a flat reading, hit a couple of UK retail groups with a strong presence in the country. DIY chain <strong>Kingfisher</strong>, which owns Castorama, was down 2.2p at 258.1p while <strong>Kesa Electricals</strong> - which is on the verge of completing the sale of Comet in the UK to concentrate on other businesses including France's Darty - closed 3.25p lower at 68.25p.</p> <p>But <strong>Dixons Retail</strong> rose 1.07p to 14.6p following an upgrade from Morgan Stanley, which moved from underweight to overweight and raised its price target from 8p to 16p.</p> <p>Finally business adviser <strong>RSM Tenon</strong> plunged 29% to 5.85p after it said six month revenues would be down 10% on the same time last year because of the current difficult economic climate, and it now expected to make a loss. It may also make adjustments to last year's accounts.</p> <p>It has limited headroom within its banking covenants, and is talking to its bank, Lloyds. Chief executive Andy Raynor is stepping down and entrepreneur Bob Morton is leaving the chairman's role although he stays on the board.</p>",

The market's eyes remain glued to the fortunes of the euro which saw the single currency make impressive gains and as a result other risk assets were in favour. Banking stocks did particularly well as the deal in Greece is expected to be finalised and once that issue is out of the way, European political leaders can focus on the next stage of repairing the crisis, which is growth. The French and German markets both rose around 0.5% while Italy added nearly 1.8%. The euro rose to three week highs against the dollar, touching $1.3037, as French finance minister Francois Baroin said a deal with Greece's private bondholders was taking shape, while his German equivalent Wolfgang Schaeuble said he wanted a second bailout programme for Greece to be in place by mid-March. But suggestions after the European markets closed that the EU and IMF had no intention of giving more money to Greece saw Wall Street slip back from its early gains. Attention could also turn back to the US, with the latest Federal Reserve meetings. Kathleen Brooks at Forex.com said: Assuming the Greek issue doesn't implode overnight then the next few days could be more Fed focused. The Federal Reserve meet on Wednesday and releases its first ever set of interest rate projections. Miners moved higher after new figures showed global steel production rose 6.8% last year, with China up 8.9%. Although the pace of growth slowed, analysts were encouraged by the fact there was any growth at all. Hopes for the Greek debt talks also lifted copper and other commodities. So Rio Tinto rose 51.5p to \u00a337.36, while BHP Billiton was 33.5p better at \u00a321.59. Vedanta Resources added 32p to 311.78 after the completion of its purchase of the bulk of Cairn Energy's Indian business. Cairn climbed 1.6p to 292.2p as its agreed to farm out part of its Greenland licence to Statoil. Cairn said: Statoil's extensive Arctic operating and development experience makes them the partner of choice for the Pitu block where we see significant potential. Lower down the market, Rockhopper Exploration, the Falklands group, rose 17.75p to 340.25p on continuing hopes a major group will take a stake in its operations or perhaps make a takeover bid. Cairn has been mentioned as one possible partner, and US group Anadarko seems to be the current favourite. Analyst Brendan Long at Merchant Securities said: We believe that Rockhopper's assets are of the same geological family as Anadarko's assets on the East Coast of Africa. We are therefore not surprised that Anadarko is taking a serious look a Rockhopper. It is possible that companies are currently considering to either enter the data room (and sign confidentiality agreements which could limit a takeover of Rockhopper) or to make a pre-emptive bid for the entire company due to its attractive valuation. Essar Energy, which was hit hard by last week's news it had come off worse in a dispute with the Indian tax office, recovered 13.1p to 135.6p. The power group increased the estimated reserves at its Raniganj coal bed methane exploration block in West Bengal from 201bn cubic feet in December 2009 to 445bn cubic feet. But Afren, the Africa-focused oil firm, lost 6.7p to 117.9p after its 2011 production figures and forecasts for the current year both missed City expectations. Oriel Securities said: Production in 2011 averaged 19,000 barrels of oil equivalent (versus our estimate of 21,000) and production is now expected to average 42,000-46,000 in 2012 (versus our estimate of 56,000). At this stage it is unclear where the differences in production come from for 2012, but looks most likely to be due to [Nigerian oil field] Ebok. Prudential put on 22.5p to 716.5p as analysts turned positive about its Asian business following reports that rival insurer AIA was interested in a $6bn purchase of ING's operations in the area. Analysts at RBS repeated their buy recommendation on Prudential, with a 900p price target. They said: M&amp;A interest in ING's Asian operations reinforces the attraction of the region, with low levels of market penetration and strong GDP growth forming a stark contrast to more challenging conditions in Europe. With fast-growing and cash-generative Asian businesses, Prudential is extremely well placed, in our view, to benefit from these trends. With 55% of its 2012 new business profits expected to be generated in the region, Prudential's valuation appeal is closely linked to the outlook for Asia. BAE Systems soared 8.8p to 322.5p as Barclays Capital raised its rating from equal weight to overweight. Its analysts said: We see a number of near-term positive catalysts, including: potentially winning the Indian fighter jet competition, stronger-than- expected Cyber growth, and potential for further buybacks to be announced with its 2011 results. We increase our BAE share price target to 370p [from 340p]. Elsewhere Weir, the pumps and valves maker, led the FTSE 100 fallers, down 70p to \u00a318.84 after JP Morgan moved from overweight to neutral. Its shares have been weak recently on worries about demand for its equipment from the shale gas industry, where analysts are questioning future rates of growth. IMI was close behind, falling 22.5p to 855p after UBS cut its rating on the engineering group from buy to neutral and its price target from 950p to 900p. Analyst Stephen Swanton said: We think the 4% organic growth IMI saw in the third quarter deteriorates further into 2012, making it more difficult to keep the margins trending up. Ocado - which moved sharply higher on Friday on vague takeover speculation - dipped 2.05p to 85.6p after the online grocer announced finance director Andrew Bracey was leaving the company to join recruitment group Michael Page International, down 0.9p at 401p, in the same role. He is expected to leave in April and Ocado has started looking for a successor. A fall in French business confidence in January, compared to expectations of a flat reading, hit a couple of UK retail groups with a strong presence in the country. DIY chain Kingfisher, which owns Castorama, was down 2.2p at 258.1p while Kesa Electricals - which is on the verge of completing the sale of Comet in the UK to concentrate on other businesses including France's Darty - closed 3.25p lower at 68.25p. But Dixons Retail rose 1.07p to 14.6p following an upgrade from Morgan Stanley, which moved from underweight to overweight and raised its price target from 8p to 16p. Finally business adviser RSM Tenon plunged 29% to 5.85p after it said six month revenues would be down 10% on the same time last year because of the current difficult economic climate, and it now expected to make a loss. It may also make adjustments to last year's accounts. It has limited headroom within its banking covenants, and is talking to its bank, Lloyds. Chief executive Andy Raynor is stepping down and entrepreneur Bob Morton is leaving the chairman's role although he stays on the board.",

With the IMF calling for the European bailout funds to be raised and Germany determined to keep a tight hold on the purse strings, there are still real disagreements over some of the other key issues that need to be resolved. Even so, Wall Street is up around 40 points in early trading, with the FTSE 100 now 59.37 points higher at 5787.92. Germany's Dax and France's CAC have edged up nearly 1% while Italy is 2% higher. Italian and Spanish bond yields are falling again on hopes of a resolution to the crisis. Meanwhile there was a slight improvement in European confidence in January, if you can believe such a thing in a month when global gloom has predominated and Standard &amp; Poor's cut the credit ratings of nine eurozone countries. The EC consumer confidence index came in a -20.6 compared to -21.3 in December and a little better than the forecast -21.7. Annalisa Piazza at Newedge Strategy said: The outcome is in line with our forecast but a touch less gloomy than the median market forecast. That said, consumer confidence remains close to the relative low levels as households remain concerned about the future financial situation. The past two-week stabilization in financial markets, coupled with the first signs of easing inflationary pressures, might have helped to give a relative boost to confidence. However, it is far too early to anticipate a sustainable improvement in household confidence as uncertainties remain extremely high.",

The other is that Tim Steiner, one of the three founders, is juggling too many balls as chief executive. Neither concern will be eased by news that finance director Andrew Bracey, who lately had become the other face of Ocado in the City, is quitting to join recruitment firm Michael Page. Bracey was \u2013 and says he still is \u2013 a true believer in the Ocado way. He piled into the shares heavily in the weeks after flotation in 2010, accumulating much of his holding of 820,000 at 150p \u2013 a chunky investment even for a chap who had spent 18 years in private equity and investment banking. In the later role, he had advised Ocado almost since its creation a decade ago. Finance directors don't normally quit the companies they think will make them rich and, with the share price now below 100p (versus a float price of 180p), Bracey's exit hadn't seemed a risk. After all, he's been finance director for little more than two years and had seemed the type to stay until his belief in Ocado was reflected in results and the share price. His resignation halted the mini-revival in the share price that followed last week's Christmas trading statement \u2013 the price was down 2% at 85p on Monday morning. Naturally, Bracey was expressing the usual sentiment about an opportunity that's too good to turn down. Recruitment is not everybody's idea of excitement but it's true that Michael Page is a more global business than Ocado ever will be. If you're an ambitious numbers man who doesn't want to be pigeon-holed as such \u2013 which seems to be a fair description of the 44-year-old Bracey \u2013 having an international employer on your CV could be seen as sensible. Even so, it still looks a strange move. Still, at least he says he won't be selling his Ocado shares. What about the worry that Ocado rests too heavily on Steiner? The company itself seems to acknowledge the problem. Mark Richardson, head of technology (a crucial job at Ocado), is being promoted to the board as operations director. More intriguingly, Jason Gissing, the other remaining member of the founding trio, is switching from the curious role of \"director of people, culture and communications\" to be commercial director, which is definitely a hands-on job. Is that what Gissing really wants? Last summer he told the FT (paywall) he was taking stock of his life after spending 20 years being \"a hamster on a wheel\" at Goldman Sachs and Ocado. Now he's firmly back on the spinning wheel \u2013 \"at the heart of our retail development,\" as the company puts it. The aim, it adds, is to \"allow Tim Steiner greater freedom to drive Ocado's strategy forward\". One can understand why Steiner requires a lighter load, but is he shedding the right responsibilities? Shouldn't the top operative be concentrating on the essential job of ensuring the Hatfield warehouse runs smoothly, which it didn't last autumn? Isn't Ocado's strategy \u2013 open another warehouse in Warwickshire \u2013 set in stone? We shall see. As ever with Ocado, the numbers are everything. If proper bottom-line profits finally appear this year, internal management dynamics won't seem remotely important. In the short-term, though, Ocado looks more mysterious to outsiders than it did.",

      "bodyText": "Bonmarch\u00e9, the plus-sized womenswear chain of collapsed retailer Peacocks Group, has been sold in a pre-pack administration that will lead to 1,400 job losses. Private equity firm Sun European Partners, which also owns the Alexon and Jacques Vert brands, bought the retailer that mainly sells to older women for an undisclosed sum, believed to be about \u00a310m. Sun said it would close about 160 stores which will lead to about 1,400 of Bonmarch\u00e9's 3,800 workforce losing their jobs. Staff in stores facing the axe were being told on Monday, but the company declined to issue a list of affected shops. The deal comes days after Bonmarch\u00e9's parent company Peacocks Group collapsed into administration putting 9,600 jobs at risk. The administrator, KPMG, is still hoping to find a buyer for the historic chain which traces its roots back to 1884, but have warned of substantial job losses. Almost half of its head office staff in Cardiff were made redundant last week. Bonmarch\u00e9's pre-pack administration, which allows a pre-arranged buyer to pick up profitable elements of the company without many of its debts, will allow the company's brand to survive on the high street. Chris Laverty, joint administrator at KPMG, said: \"Given the hostile conditions on the high street, we're pleased to have concluded a sale with Sun European Partners. \"The deal is a positive step forward in underscoring Bonmarch\u00e9's future.\" Sun's vice-president Matthias Gundlach said was putting \"a sustainable growth programme\" in place. \"Bonmarch\u00e9 is a great brand that operates in an attractive niche of the apparel sector that we know very well. Thanks to its strong range with a good value-for-money proposition and a unique in-store service experience, Bonmarch\u00e9 has a loyal customer base of regular repeat buyers.\" It is the fourth retail deal in recent months for US-owned Sun following the acquisition of Alexon, Jacques Vert and American Golf. A number of private equity firms, including Sun, and clothing chain Edinburgh Woollen Mill are understood to be among 50 firms to have registered an interested in buying Peacocks. Initial bids are expected by the end of the month. Tesco is said to be interested in picking up some of its stores to expand its Express chain.",

      "bodyText": "Reports of a bid for ING's Asian businesses have put the spotlight on Prudential, which also has prime assets in the area. AIA, one-third owned by US group AIG, is said to be interested in buying ING's Asian operations for around $6bn, prompting analysts at RBS to repeat their buy recommendation on Prudential, with a 900p price target. They say: M&amp;A interest in ING's Asian operations reinforces the attraction of the region, with low levels of market penetration and strong GDP growth forming a stark contrast to more challenging conditions in Europe. With fast-growing and cash-generative Asian businesses, Prudential is extremely well placed, in our view, to benefit from these trends. With 55% of its 2012 new business profits expected to be generated in the region, Prudential's valuation appeal is closely linked to the outlook for Asia. Prudential is up 18p at 712p. But the \"more challenging conditions\" in Europe have been reinforced by a fall in French business confidence in January, compared to expectations of a flat reading. The news has hit a couple of UK retail groups with a strong presence in the country. DIY chain Kingfisher, which owns Castorama, is down 1.5p at 258.8p while Kesa Electricals - which is on the verge of completing the sale of Comet in the UK to concentrate on other businesses including France's Darty - has lost 2.15p to 69.35p. Elsewhere Weir, the pumps and valves maker, is down 35p at \u00a319.19 after JP Morgan moved from overweight to neutral. Its shares have been weak recently on worries about demand for its equipment from the shale gas industry, where analysts are questioning future rates of growth. JP Morgan said: Weir has been in the top three share price performers in our universe for the last two years, with the share price up by 167% since 1 January 2010. For 2012, we expect the group to continue to deliver growth with earnings per share set to rise 18%. However, given the low natural gas price in the US and high gas inventories, we expect the perceived increased uncertainty about near-term development in demand for fracking equipment to weigh on the share price (and increase volatility) given the high valuation multiples that Weir trades on. Afren, the Africa-focused oil firm, has fallen 8.6p to 116p after its 2011 production figures and forecasts for the current year both missed City expectations. Oriel Securities said: Production in 2011 averaged 19,000 barrels of oil equivalent (versus our estimate of 21,000) and production is now expected to average 42,000-46,000 in 2012 (versus our estimate of 56,000). At this stage it is unclear where the differences in production come from for 2012, but looks most likely to be due to [Nigerian oil field] Ebok. Lower down the market business adviser RSM Tenon has plunged 27% to 5.95p after it said six month revenues would be down 10% on the same time last year because of the current difficult economic climate, and it now expected to make a loss. It may also make adjustments to last year's accounts. It has limited headroom within its banking covenants, and is talking to its bank, Lloyds. Chief executive Andy Raynor is stepping down and entrepreneur Bob Morton is leaving the chairman's role although he stays on the board. James Hamilton at Numis said: The competitive environment and pricing pressure for services has been a key driver of half of the decline in revenue with the other half driven largely by accounting changes. These accounting changes will drive non-cash prior year adjustments. We believe this relates to the value and recoverability of the group's receivables and we further believe the value of the group's goodwill must be reviewed given the current market and economic environment. Management believe second half revenues will be similar to the second half last year but we believe the conditions that drove the first half performance this year are likely to persist through the second, making this difficult but not impossible to achieve. Not for widows and orphans but on balance we believe it does not serve Lloyds not to support RSM Tenon. Shareholders are however likely to see significant value lost and substantial risks remain. Our target price and recommendation have been under review for some time due to the group's financial position and remain so.",
