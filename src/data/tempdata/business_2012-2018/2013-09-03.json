      "bodyText": "Tesco has been criticised by the advertising watchdog for claiming that the horsemeat scandal affected the entire food industry. The Advertising Standards Agency (ASA) ruled that an ad run by Tesco in February, at the height of the food crisis, \"implied that all retailers and suppliers were likely to have sold products contaminated with horsemeat\" when \"relatively few instances of contamination had been identified at the time\". The ad now banned by the ASA, entitled \"What burgers have taught us\", said: \"The problem we've had with some of our meat lately is about more than burgers and bolognese. It's about some of the ways we get meat to your dinner table. It's about the whole food industry.\" Two people, including an independent butcher, complained that the ad was misleading because it implied there were issues with meat standards across the whole food industry, unfairly denigrating suppliers who had not been involved in the supply of mislabelled products. The news comes at a sensitive time for the UK's biggest supermarket as it attempts to rebuild its reputation and market share in the wake of the scandal and problems with customer service. It recently launched a high profile ad campaign called \"Love Every Mouthful\" in a bid to highlight the quality of its food after promising to source more meat from the UK and Ireland and step up testing to avoid future contamination. Tesco's share price plummeted in January after tests carried out by Ireland's food watchdog identified traces of horsemeat in burgers sold in its stores, as well as Iceland, Aldi and Lidl. Tesco launched an internal investigation and placed a series of national newspaper ads apologising for the incident and explaining how it planned to change. In response to the ruling Tesco said it accepted that not all those involved in the food industry had been implicated in the sale of products containing horsemeat. Rival supermarkets including Sainsbury's, Marks &amp; Spencer and Waitrose were never found to have sourced food contaminated with horsemeat. However Tesco said it had not operated in a vaccuum and the meat contamination problem it and others had encountered was due to systemic failings in the food supply chain. It submitted opinion and evidence from an expert to back that view, which the supermarket said was supported by the actions of the European commission and planned legislation on the supply chain which would apply to the whole European food industry. A spokesman said: \"We are disappointed with this decision, but accept that the ASA has taken a very literal view of the wording in the advert. We think our customers understood that our aim with the advert was to set out the action we had taken in relation to the horsemeat crisis and to acknowledge the fact the issue had serious consequences not just for Tesco, but for the whole of the food industry.\" The ASA said the ad made the \"definitive statement\" that the crisis was \"about the whole food industry\" and concluded that consumers would understand that it referred to all food suppliers rather than Tesco alone. However it said the ad did not denigrate other companies because it did not name any particular supplier.",

      "bodyText": "One million hard-pressed borrowers prepared to pay interest at up to 5,853% have propelled Wonga.com into the league of Britain's biggest lenders after the controversial payday loan company lent as much money last year as Britain's biggest building society advanced in personal loans. The Archbishop of Canterbury's promise to \"compete Wonga out of existence\" has failed to dent the group's frenetic expansion, it emerged on Tuesday, as Wonga said its profits had leapt by more than a third to \u00a362.5m, with the number of loans granted growing even faster. During 2012 it handed out nearly four million loans, worth a total of \u00a31.2bn, to one million customers in Britain, matching the amount Nationwide granted in personal loans. \"Digital savvy\" consumers are flocking to Wonga, said founder and chief executive Errol Damelin, whose salary increased by \u00a3119,000 to \u00a3754,000 over the year, with his personal shareholding estimated to be worth more than \u00a330m. On ITV he compared taking a loan from Wonga to buying a song on iTunes. \"This is not about people on breadlines being desperate \u2026 this is about us serving customers who want to take a loan and know they can pay it back in three days \u2013 that is in the same way that they want to buy one song on iTunes.\" But when Wonga chairman Robin Klein was asked if he would be happy about his own child taking a loan from Wonga, he said: \"I would tell them to come to me instead.\" Stella Creasy, the Labour MP who has campaigned against payday lenders, said the news of Wonga's profits \"should be of great concern to all of us in Britain\". \"What that says about families who are struggling financially, what it says about the kind of regulation we currently have in the UK and the things we need to do to make sure people in Britain can borrow affordably \u2013 Wonga might be celebrating today [but] I am very, very concerned about what this might mean for people in my community and across the country who are paying the price for their profits.\" Wonga's breakneck pace of expansion has overshadowed the credit unions that the archbishop, Justin Welby, said he hoped to promote but which have so far failed to emerge as an alternative to the payday lenders. Wonga alone is now three times the size of all the 390 credit unions in Britain, which last year lent just \u00a3407m in total. But Damelin said the credit union idea promoted by the archbishop would require state handouts and said he opposed Labour proposals for a levy on payday lenders to fund their development. The archbishop's attack on Wonga caused him acute embarrassment when it emerged shortly afterwards that the Church of England's pension fund was indirectly an investor in Wonga. Wonga plans now to try to repeat its success abroad. The company saidon Tuesday it had \"ambitions far beyond short-term consumer loans in the UK\" with its business in South Africa growing rapidly over the past year. It also operates in Russia, Canada and Poland. Meanwhile in Britain the company is aiming to fill the gap left by the high street banks in the small business market, with the launch of WongaForBusiness.com. Damelin said that nearly a quarter of loans taken out by Wonga customers are repaid early, and that it is a responsible lender, rejecting about three quarters of first-loan applications. But the accounts reveal that it wrote off \u00a396m and made a \u00a3126m provision for customers defaulting in 2012, double the levels of 2011. Trade union Unite said the financial results demonstrated the need for legislation to curb payday lenders. \"Payday lenders are making their profits on those struggling to make ends meet on a daily basis with outrageous rates of interest that mount up with an alarming speed, causing fear and insecurity,\" the general secretary, Len McCluskey, said. \"Ted Heath once spoke of the unacceptable face of capitalism \u2013 what we are seeing in 2013 is vulture capitalism, picking wallets and purses clean.\"",

Microsoft can use Nokia to really drive innovation on the platform, as Google is doing with Motorola. However, in order to succeed it will need to ensure it maintains good relationships with its partners.</p> </blockquote> <p>3) <strong>Is Elop the Guy to turn Microsoft around?</strong> The Nokia deal paves the way for Elop to replace Steve Ballmer as CEO, but has he really earned it?</p> <p>During his thre years at Nokia, Elop has seen revenues slide and profitability tumble. Not the best track record to take back to Seattle. Also not all his fault -- Nokia was already in deep trouble in 2010. </p> <p>Technology guru <a href=\"http://gigaom.com/author/om/\">Om Malik</a> was scathing about Elop's performance in Finland, <a href=\"http://gigaom.com/2013/09/03/why-i-think-the-7-2-billion-microsoft-nokia-deal-is-a-terrible-idea/\">writing</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Stephen Elop\u2019s tenure as the chief executive of Nokia would at best earn him a B-minus grade, and that much because he inherited a company that was spiraling down before he showed up. The&#xa0;\u201cbet the farm on Windows Phone move\u201d&#xa0;however was all him. Since taking over the reins at Nokia in 2010, Elop has seen smartphone sales shrink faster than a $5-dollar linen shirt.</p> <p>If anything, Elop\u2019s tenure at the top of Nokia will be remembered for the years when Nokia became irrelevant in the the mobile handset business. In a post,&#xa0;\u201cThe End of the (Nokia) Raj\u201d, I hinted at a future of irrelevance for Nokia. The fall from grace came much sooner than even I thought. Elop is now being widely tipped to take over Microsoft as its next chief executive, replacing outgoing Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer. Given his track record, if I were a Microsoft shareholder, I would have to pause and gulp hard before putting the future of the company in his hands.</p> </blockquote> <p>More here: <a href=\"http://gigaom.com/2013/09/03/why-i-think-the-7-2-billion-microsoft-nokia-deal-is-a-terrible-idea/\">Why I think the $7.2 billion Microsoft-Nokia deal is a terrible idea</a></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5225ea6ee4b074ec2339229a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-09-03T14:00:05.397Z\">3.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Shares in Nokia, though, are still up around 40%.</strong></p> <p>Nokia will still continue as an independent company once Microsoft subsumes its handset division.

      "bodyText": "Trading is over in Helsinki, after a day dominated by the news that Nokia was selling its mobile handset operations to Microsoft. Shares in Nokia finished the day up almost 34% at \u20ac3.97, up one euro. The cost of insuring its debt against default almost halved, data provider Markit reported. While over on Wall Street, US investors continue to view the deal with suspicion. Shares in Microsoft are down 6.2%, shedding two cents to $31.34. I outlined some reasons for the fall here. European stock markets finished the day mostly in the red. There was a late sell-off after John Boehner, the US Republican Speaker in Congress, backed president Obama's call for military action against the Syrian regime. Here's the closing prices: \u2022 FTSE 100: down 37 points at 6468, - 0.6% \u2022 German DAX: down 63 points at 8180, -0,77% \u2022 French CAC: down 31 points at 3974, -0.8% \u2022 Italian FTSE MIB: down 47 points at 16941, -0.28% \u2022 Spanish IBEX: up 15 points at 8445, + 0.2% Michael Hewson of CMC Markets reminds us that the markets also had a morning wobble over the Middle East (see 10.15am for details): European markets have had a slightly less exuberant air about them today after the strong gains of yesterday as nervousness about the situation in the Middle East spilled over on reports of two ballistic missiles being fired in the Mediterranean, caused markets to slump sharply in the morning session. Markets did regain their equilibrium somewhat after it was confirmed that it was a missile test by Israel but it was a timely reminder of the fluidity and uncertainty of the situation in the region, and kept investors on the back foot somewhat throughout the remainder of the day, despite some positive US economic data (see 4.54pm). And that's a good moment to stop today's live blog. Thank you, as ever, for reading and commenting. Back tomorrow! GW Missed this earlier... the Spanish unemployment total fell in August, by just 31 people. The Labour Ministry reported that the registered jobless total fell last month, for the first August since 2000. But with almost six million out of work, much more needs to be done. Economy minister Luis de Guindos told Cadena Ser radio that Spain had hit the 'bottom' now: There's a stabilization in the jobs market, and I'd say this is a reason for hope. There's a great deal more to do ... but I'd say we've hit bottom. In the second part of this year we'll see slight (economic) growth. Hats off to City AM for another  cracking story about the burning issue in London today -- the new Walkie Talkie skyscraper whose unique design has been reflecting a super-bright beam of light down on Fenchurch Street. Reporter James Waterson, who revealed on Monday that the ray (caused by the building's concave design) had apparently damaged a Jaguar, broke new ground today by frying an egg in the light reflecting off the Walkie Talkie. And very tasty it looked too in this video: More here. More encouraging news for the global economy this afternoon: America's manufacturing sector has posted its strongest growth since July 2011. Wall Street correspondent Dominic Rushe writes that the data (held over from Monday because of Labor Day) beat forecasts: US manufacturing expanded in August at the fastest pace since June 2011, according to a closely watched poll of the sector. Economic activity in the manufacturing sector expanded for the third consecutive month, according to the Institute of Supply Management (ISM). The ISM poll of purchasing managers rose to 55.7% from 55.4% in July \u2013 readings above 50% indicate growth in the manufacturing sector. The poll was better than forecast and comes before the latest monthly job figures are released by the Labor Department on Friday. Yesterday we saw strong manufacturing data from the UK and most eurozone countries, although India's factory sector suffered falling activity. Thanks, as ever, for the comments below the line. Here's a selection on the Microsoft-Nokia deal: Regular readers have been berating me 'below the line' for the lack of coverage of the eurozone debt crisis today. In truth, there's not that much going on (Merkel's jousting in the Bundesbank was the early highlight). But Open Europe, the think tank, has published a survey of German voters' views on the euro, which is rather interesting. Key findings include: \u2022 55% believe the eurozone would be better if it were restricted to a group of 'similar countries: Reverting to the Deutsche-mark is only backed by one-third of voters (32%) versus 60% opposing it, with a similar breakdown on the option of breaking up the euro completely (30% tend to agree, 59% tend to disagree). 46% said the euro shouldn\u2019t be saved \u201cat any cost\u201d, while 42% said it should. 42% said they agree the euro is now threatening the European project \u2013 only marginally lower than those who say it does not (45%). \u2022 Voters don't want to see further financial assistance to the euro area: Almost two-thirds (65%) said the next Chancellor would only have the mandate to sign up to more money going to other eurozone countries if a referendum was held. More here. Slate sums up the lacklustre response to Microsoft's big deal, saying the tech giant has \"cemented its also-ran status\" in the mobile world. Microsoft...will go from being a minor afterthought in the mobile devices and services world to a much larger afterthought. Google, Apple, and Samsung may not exactly be quaking in their boots this morning, but BlackBerry is pretty much screwed. Personally, my favourite Nokia handset was the 7110 with the spring-loaded cover (as seen in the \"The Matrix\") Sadly our love affair was ended by a London bag-snatcher back in 2001 (yes, I'm still cross about it). But you probably don't agree. So let us know in this open thread: Nokia handsets: Readers' favourites The Economist also homes in on Stephen Elop's chequered time at Nokia: It's early days, but a 4% fall in Microsoft's shares today shows that investors and analysts aren't convinced that buying Nokia's mobile devices and services arm is the path to glory? So why not? 1) It's hardly a transformational deal. Nokia has been tied to Microsoft's banner for the last two years, and the drop in market share has been steady (as we showed at 1.12pm). The Lumia range gets good reviews, but Android and Apple devices still dominate. Buying Nokia suggests Microsoft doesn't have a better plan to crack the mobile space (and may mean there isn't one) 2) Could it backfire? Nokia isn't the only firm to make Windows Phone devices, but other vendors could be concerned that Microsoft won't give them priority once it also owns a handset business. Adrian Drozd of Frost &amp; Sullivan explains: In order to grow market share, Microsoft will need to keep Samsung and HTC on board, and will need to alleviate any concerns that emerge as a result of the acquisition. Microsoft can use Nokia to really drive innovation on the platform, as Google is doing with Motorola. However, in order to succeed it will need to ensure it maintains good relationships with its partners. 3) Is Elop the Guy to turn Microsoft around? The Nokia deal paves the way for Elop to replace Steve Ballmer as CEO, but has he really earned it? During his thre years at Nokia, Elop has seen revenues slide and profitability tumble. Not the best track record to take back to Seattle. Also not all his fault -- Nokia was already in deep trouble in 2010. Technology guru Om Malik was scathing about Elop's performance in Finland, writing: Stephen Elop\u2019s tenure as the chief executive of Nokia would at best earn him a B-minus grade, and that much because he inherited a company that was spiraling down before he showed up. The \u201cbet the farm on Windows Phone move\u201d however was all him. Since taking over the reins at Nokia in 2010, Elop has seen smartphone sales shrink faster than a $5-dollar linen shirt. If anything, Elop\u2019s tenure at the top of Nokia will be remembered for the years when Nokia became irrelevant in the the mobile handset business. In a post, \u201cThe End of the (Nokia) Raj\u201d, I hinted at a future of irrelevance for Nokia. The fall from grace came much sooner than even I thought. Elop is now being widely tipped to take over Microsoft as its next chief executive, replacing outgoing Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer. Given his track record, if I were a Microsoft shareholder, I would have to pause and gulp hard before putting the future of the company in his hands. More here: Why I think the $7.2 billion Microsoft-Nokia deal is a terrible idea Shares in Nokia, though, are still up around 40%. Nokia will still continue as an independent company once Microsoft subsumes its handset division. It is keeping its interests in telecoms equipment, and \u20ac5.4bn better off. The better half of the deal?.... Wall Street is open, and shares in Microsoft dropped by over 5% as US traders give their first reaction to the Nokia handset deal. Shares in Microsoft fell by $1.75 to $31.65 at the start of trading. Barry Collins, editor of the UK's PC Pro magazine, fears job losses ahead at Nokia's handset arm: Parts of America are digesting the news of the Microsoft-Nokia deal (it was announced at 11pm New York time), so here's a round-up of the main events so far today. \u2022 Nokia's reign as an independent mobile phone maker is over, after Microsoft agreed a \u20ac5.4bn/$7.2bn deal to take control of its mobile handsets and services division. Full coverage from the start of this blog. \u2022 Steve Ballmer's last big deal (probably) before he steps down as Microsoft's chief executive sent Nokia's shares soaring by 40% this morning. In an email to staff, Ballmer said the acquisition would build on the \"incredible work\" achieved since the two firms teamed up in 2011. \u2022 Ballmer has appeared in Helsinki to discuss the deal, calling it a \"win-win\" and \"a bold step into the future\". (details and photos here). \u2022 Microsoft hopes the deal can help it to finally break the smartphone market that is dominated by Apple and Samsung. But analysts warn that it faces an uphill battle (see 11.34am). As CCS Insight put it: The challenge of integrating the two businesses should not be underestimated, especially at a time when Microsoft is in the middle of its biggest ever reorganisation. \u2022 Nokia's CEO, Stephen Elop, will rejoin Microsoft - a company he left three years ago to run Nokia. Bookmakers have already slashed the odds on him replacing Ballmer (latest odds here) \u2022 For Nokia, the move ends its long association with the mobile handset market, which it helped to create. Finnish government minister said he hoped the deal could benefit both sides, but warned that Nokia staff need protecting (see 9.09am) Also, we have: \u2022 The three charts that show how Nokia's influence declined \u2022 A brief history of Nokia And our latest news story on the deal is here: Microsoft buys Nokia handset business for \u20ac5.4bn Looks like Microsoft shares are going to drop when trading begins in 25 minutes time. They're down almost 5% in pre-market trading (as Marketwatch shows). Confirmation that speculators who have 'shorted' Nokia are suffering big losses today as its shares surge by 40% (as I explained earlier), from Reuters: Hobart Capital director Justin Haque said the deal and the ensuing spike in Nokia's share price would hammer hedge funds.\"It's going to be a long/short body bag job,\" he said. According to the latest regulatory filings with Finland's market watchdog, U.S. fund Discovery Capital Management LLC is the fund with the biggest net 'short' position on Nokia, at 2.26 percent of the firm's shares outstanding. No one at Discovery Capital was available to comment. Unpleasant Discovery, more like... More details here We shouldn't forget Nokia's other contribution to society, that unforgettable ringtone.... Here are three key charts that show why the one-time champion of the mobile world is now throwing in its lot with Microsoft, from technology editor Charles Arthur. Here, you can see how Nokia's revenues have shrunk steadily in recent years, while operating profitability has shriveled: While this graph shows that sales of Nokia's low-end 'feature phones' have fallen steadily, but that the company has made little inroads into the lucrative smartphone market: Full story: Microsoft and Nokia's problems - explained in three graphs All Things Digital has broken the deal down into key numbers. Full article here. Here's a flavour, showing the unrealised potential in the mobile sector, and the way Nokia has declined... With 8.7 million units shipped, Windows Phone had a 3.7 percent share of global smartphone market in the second quarter of 2013, according to IDC. Windows Phone has greater than 10 percent share in nine markets, according to Microsoft Windows Phone is outselling BlackBerry in 34 markets \u2014 again, according to Microsoft. Nokia accounted for 81.6 percent of all Windows Phone smartphone shipments during the second quarter of 2013. Microsoft\u2019s gross margin on sales of Nokia\u2019s Windows Phone handsets before the deal: Less than $10. Microsoft\u2019s expected gross margin on sales of Nokia\u2019s Windows Phone handsets after the deal: More than $40. Nokia\u2019s share of the smartphone market was 49.4 percent in 2007. By fall of 2012 it was 4.3 percent. And here's how the total market breaks down: Nokia is famous for its mobile phones, but it can actually trace its roots back to 1865 - the year the American Civil War ended \u2013 when a Finnish engineer set up at wood pulp mill. The Nokia name was coined in 1867, and in 1898 Finnish Rubber Works, which later becomes Nokia's rubber business, was created, making car tyres and wellies. The firm got into the cable business shortly before the first world war, and was a pioneer in mobile networks in the 1980s and 1990s. Here's the full history: Nokia: the rise and fall of a mobile phone giant Here's our updated news story on the Microsoft-Nokia deal, which is dubbed a \"swansong\" deal for MS's outgoing CEO Steve Ballmer. Stephen Elop, Nokia's outgoing CEO, told reporters that he felt \"a great deal of sadness\" over the way his time at the firm ended, but insisted: It's very clear to me that rationally this is the right step going forward. Elop's biggest decision at Nokia was to pin the handset maker to the Windows Phone operating system. Over his three years in charge, Nokia's market share crumbled -- to 15% of the total handset market, and just 3% of smartphone sales (corrected). Microsoft's presentation explaining the deal (online here) shows that it hopes to triple its market share to 15% in five years time. Microsoft's Steve Ballmer flew to Helsinki to shake hands with Nokia's chairman Risto Siilasmaa this morning, and tell staff and journalists why the \u20ac5.4bn acquisition of the firm's mobile arm makes sense. Ballmer declared: It's a bold step into the future a win-win for employees, shareholders and consumers of both companies. It's a signature event. Ballmer also said there are no 'significant' plans to move work out of Finland (as reported earlier, Microsoft is also planning to build a new data centre in Helsinki). Several analysts are suggesting this morning that Nokia has got the better end of the deal (see opening post for full coverage) Richard Windsor, of Radio Free Mobile, can see several immediate benefits to Nokia -- but struggles to see how Microsoft will profit. He writes: This deal does nothing for the Microsoft Ecosystem and may even hinder its adoption by other handset makers. It sends a signal that Nokia is of the opinion that its proposition will not work on its own and that it should get out now to maximise value for shareholders. Any pretence of Microsoft\u2019s independence has now gone meaning that the likes of Samsung, LG, HTC and so on will be even less keen to make Windows Phones than they already were. The Windows Phone ecosystem will now be wholly reliant on Lumia, which is a good product line, but users seem to have no idea why it is great or why they should buy it. This is essentially a marketing problem and Microsoft seems to have no clue how to send a message that goes beyond \u201cif you build it they will come\u201d. Nokia has recognised this issue and perhaps as part of Microsoft it will have the ability to put all of Microsoft\u2019s vast resources towards solving the problem. The deal buys Nokia time to get the proposition right, as Microsoft\u2019s commitment has substantially strengthened but something has to change in order to see real adoption. This deal does nothing to solve the issue of the availability of applications, which remains the single biggest reason why a user will return a Lumia device. History is not on Microsoft\u2019s side as its attempts to build from scratch or acquire device businesses have pretty much been expensive disasters. Net net this is very positive for Nokia shareholders as substantial value should now be realised but how this benefits Microsoft remains pretty unclear. CCS Insight agrees that Microsoft faces a big challenge to grow Windows Phone's small share of the smartphone market. This is still by no means a silver-bullet solution to Nokia and Microsoft's current difficulties. The massive restructuring that Nokia has done over the last two years offers Microsoft a more stable foundation on which to focus its efforts in mobile. However, Windows Phone remains a distant third place in the smartphone race compared with Apple and Google/Samsung. The challenge of integrating the two businesses should not be underestimated, especially at a time when Microsoft is in the middle of its biggest ever reorganisation. And fund managers are already blasting the deal, as Bloomberg's Caroline Hyde reports: Back to Microsoft-Nokia again, and here's the Finnish company showing how the two firms have been drawn together: A sign of the times: Payday lender Wonga has grown its profits by a third, despite steady criticism from consumer groups, some MPs and even the Church of England. Here's the story: Wonga profits rise by 36% to \u00a362m The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development has hiked its growth forecasts for the UK and Europe, but admitted that it was too optimistic about America and China's prospects. The OECD now expects Britain's GDP to expand by 1.5% this year, almost twice as strong as May's from a previous forecast of 1.1%. That reflects general optimism than the UK recovery is gathering pace, and the fact we know the UK economy expanded by 0.7% in the second quarter alone. It also predicted that French GDP would increase by 0.3% this year \u2013 weak growth, but rather better than the -0.3% estimated in May. Germany's GDP forecast was hiked from 0.4% to 0.7%. But on the downside, the OEC cut its US forecast for 2013 from +1.9% to +1.7%, and its China forecast from +7.8% to +7.4%. Angela Merkel has been lambasting her opponents over the eurozone crisis this morning, at the final session of the Bundestag before the general election on September 22nd. Associated Press has the details: Chancellor Angela Merkel is taunting her opponents in Germany's Sept. 22 election over their criticism of her approach to Europe's debt crisis pointing out that they have voted for practically all her rescue policies. Merkel's center-left challenger, Peer Steinbrueck, argues that she has focused too heavily on austerity in struggling countries and done too little to encourage growth. But in a boisterous final session of Parliament before the vote, Merkel said Tuesday that Europe must stick to her approach. She told the opposition: \"It doesn't make sense, when you've voted for everything, to shout so much.\" Merkel added that Germany can't be sure the opposition would maintain her approach because it has talked about pooling European debt \"and we say that can't work out well.\" Stephen Elop is the odds-on favourite to become Microsoft's next CEO (see 8.51am), but do you think he's got what it takes to replace Steve Ballmer and take the company forward? Vote here: Should Stephen Elop take over at Microsoft? Worth noting that those 'missiles' were apparently detected several hours ago.... (at 10.16am Moscow time, or 7.16am BST) Just shows how jittery the markets can be.... The FTSE 100 index just tumbled half a percent following reports from Russian state media that two missiles had been detected over the Eastern Mediterranean. However, the picture is rather confused - it's not clear what has happened. Here's the news flashes that sent the FTSE down 32 points, or 0.5%, to 6473. *RUSSIA SAYS LAUNCH OF 2 BALLISTIC MISSILES DETECTED: RIA *RUSSIA SAYS MISSILES SEEN HEADED TOWARD EAST MEDITERRANEAN: IFX And here's Reuters early take: Russian radar detected two ballistic \"objects\" that were fired towards the eastern Mediterranean from the central part of the sea on Tuesday, state-run news agency RIA quoted the Defence Ministry as saying. The Defence Ministry declined immediate comment to Reuters. A ministry official had earlier criticised the United States for deploying warships in the Mediterranean close to Syria. My colleague Matthew Weaver on our Middle East liveblog will have all the details as the story develops. Breaking away from Microsoft-Nokia, Britain's construction sector has posted its strongest monthly growth in almost six years. Markit's monthly measure of construction output, just released, showed that activity surged in August to hit 59.1 on its PMI survey (details online here). That's the highest reading since since September 2007 -- the month of the Northern Rock Bank Run, when the financial crisis struck the UK. Builders reported an increase in spending by clients, both in the housing sector and for public sector infrastructure. Residential construction led the way, suggesting the government's controversial 'Help to Buy' mortgage-subsidy scheme is driving demand. And after some very tough months, the construction sector is much more optimistic. Markit reported: Construction companies also remain confident about the year-ahead outlook for business activity at their units, with around 46% of survey respondents expecting a rise and only 10% a reduction. David Noble, chief executive officer at the Chartered Institute of Purchasing &amp; Supply, declared that \"a new dawn is breaking in construction\". Builders have seen a step change in recent months and are now starting to show their true potential to the UK economy. That surge in Nokia's share price is bad news for hedge funds who had bet that the company would continue to decline. More than 10% of its stock has been loaned to speculators who had 'shorted' the company's stock, planning to buy it back in the future at a cheaper price. Not any more.... Nokia's shares are 40% up this morning, reflecting optimism that the parts of the business left behind after Microsoft departs (including wireless infrastructure and cloud computing) coud have a better future. But at \u20ac4.06, it's a far cry from the glory days of 2000 when they changed for \u20ac65bn (as the graph above shows). Alexander Stubb, Finland's minister for European Affairs, has urged Microsoft to protect Nokia's employees who join it following today's deal. Stubb says it's vital to offer job security to the 32,000 Nokia workers, out of around 56,000, who will be transferred to Microsoft. Stubb also confirms that the end of Nokia's independent role as a mobile handset firm is an emotional moment, but insists the deal could be good news for the eurozone's most northerly member: Ladbrokes has now cut the odds on Stephen Elop replacing Steve Ballmer at the head of Microsoft to just 4/6 (ie, you'd win \u00a34 for ever \u00a36 you wagered, plus your stake). He's followed by Sheryl Sandberg, although even Facebook's 'grownup in the room' is only a 7-1 shout. Ladbrokes spokesman Alex Donaghue explained: We've reacted to the news of the deal by making Elop the hot odds-on favourite to replace Ballmer. His position as favourite strengthened with confidence running up to the announcement and the betting now suggests he's in pole position to replace Ballmer when he retires. Among the long shots, you can get 25-1 on Bill Gates returning, 33-1 on Yahoo's Marissa Meyer, or a frankly unlikely 100-1 on Apple's Tim Cook. The Microsoft-Nokia deal has caused a fine old storm on Twitter this morning, which has been buzzing about the news since it broke at 4am BST (6am Finnish time or 11pm in New York). Former BBC technology editor Tim Weber sums up the initial excitement: My colleague Angela Monaghan rounds up some of the best tweets here: Twitter reaction to Microsoft buying Nokia's handset business 30-page presentation outlining the strategic vision behind Microsoft's move on Nokia, anyone?... Steve \"Monkey Boy\" Ballmer has emailed Microsoft employees about the \"exciting news\" of the Nokia deal. He's clearly lost none of his trademark enthusiasm: We are very excited about the proposal to bring the best mobile device efforts of Microsoft and Nokia together. Our Windows Phone partnership over the past two and half years has yielded incredible work - the stunning Lumia 1020 is a great example. Our partnership has also yielded incredible growth. In fact, Nokia Windows Phones are the fastest-growing phones in the smartphone market. Here's the full email: Telecoms analysts CSS Insight say Microsoft's move is risky, but also unavoidable if the firm is to maintain a foothold in the mobile space. Here's CSS's early reaction to the news: A necessary gamble by Microsoft to break into mobile given its complete reliance on Nokia for Windows Phone devices and the competitive position of Apple and Google with rival phone platforms. Completely reshapes Microsoft's business pushing it firmly into hardware. Raises big questions about sustainability of remaining pure play phone makers. Shares in Nokia have leapt 47% at the start of trading in Helsinki. The Guardian's technology editor, Charles Arthur, writes: Microsoft has swooped in to buy the handset business of Finland's Nokia, an audacious move that confirms the Redmond software company's intention to compete with Apple and Google head-on as a \"devices and services\" business. The deal, for \u20ac5.44bn (\u00a34.6bn), gives Microsoft a company which used to dominate the mobile and smartphone market in 2006 but has been overshadowed by the rise of Apple and, latterly, Samsung and companies using Google's Android software. For Nokia, it means that a decades-long heritage as one of the world's leading mobile phone makers - which had been a source of huge pride in Finland - is over. Here's Charles full news story: Nokia's handset business bought by Microsoft for \u20ac5.44bn Technology site ZDNet has pulled together 11 key points on the Microsoft-Nokia deal. Here's a few: Microsoft will make available to Nokia about \u20ac1.5 billion ($1.97bn) in financing in the form of three payments of \u20ac500 million ($659m) from oversees resources. Nokia shareholders are expected to vote on the deal in an extraordinary general meeting on November 19 this year. Microsoft will build a datacenter in Finland that will serve Microsoft and Nokia customers in Europe. More than $750 million in capital will be spent on the new datacenter over the next few years. Microsoft-Nokia deal: 11 quick facts Traders predict Nokia's shares will soar when the Helsinki stock market opens (at 10am local time or 8am BST). One tantalising point in the Nokia deal is that the company's CEO, Stephen Elop \u2013 a former Microsoft executive \u2013is rejoining the firm. With Steve Ballmer already committed to retiring within a year, today's deal appears to make Elop an even firmer frontrunner to take over. Kara Swisher of All Things Digital is calling Elop the candidate to beat: It seems clear that the acquisition puts the former president of Microsoft\u2019s business division in the front of the line to take over the software giant, ahead of several internal candidates and a whole lot of external ones. In fact, Elop is both external and internal. While Elop has critics who say he did not fix Nokia or much of anything else in his long career in tech, others are likely to point to a pedigree that would also make him the favorite here. Here's Microsoft's statement announcing the deal, issued shortly before midnight in the US. Microsoft to acquire Nokia\u2019s devices &amp; services business, license Nokia\u2019s patents and mapping services Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the latest news across the business world, the global economy, the financial markets and the eurozone. The biggest news story of the day may already have broken. Nokia, once one of the brightest jewels in the crown of Europe's technology world, is selling its mobile phone operations to Microsoft in a $7.2bn (\u20ac5.4bn) deal. Announced in the early hours of this morning, the long-awaited deal ends Nokia's long, and increasingly troubled, role as an independent handset maker. Here's our early take: Both Nokia, once the undisputed leader in mobile phones, and Microsoft have been struggling to respond to the challenge from smartphone makers such as Apple and Samsung. Analysts say [CEO Stephen] Elop's decision in 2011 to adopt Microsoft's untested Windows Phone software has yet to pay off. The deal is expected to be finalised in the first quarter of 2014 and is subject to approval by Nokia's shareholders and regulatory approvals. Nokia partnered in 2011 with Microsoft and uses Microsoft's Windows software to run its mobile phones. \"It's a bold step into the future \u2013 a win-win for employees, shareholders and consumers of both companies,\" said Microsoft's outgoing chief executive, Steve Ballmer. It must be a bitter-sweet moment for Finland. At its peak, Nokia was a huge part of its economy -- contributing a quarter of Finnish growth from 1998 to 2007. But the rise of the iPhone and Google's Android platform, and its own missteps, had put the company's future in doubt. For Microsoft, the acquisition could help it make up ground in the mobile sector, and bolster its hardware operations. Analysts, though, aren't convinced it will reverse the Seattle firm's own fortunes. I'll cover all the reaction to the deal, and analysis of what it means, through the next few hours along with other breaking news through the day as usual....",

The bank warned that changes in the sugar market were likely to depress profits in the sector, but ABF's other businesses - especially Primark - would take up the slack. They said:</p> <blockquote> The European sugar market operates under a highly regulated regime that stifles competition. This world will end in September 2017. When it does, we see severe profit compression for all European sugar industry participants. <br> [So] why move to outperform in an apocalypse? Put simply, the sugar bear case is dead. While the new regime will materially impact [ABF's] sugar profits (we look for a decline of around 50% in Europe), this represents only a 9% drag on the group in 2018 (when Primark will represent 63% of earnings). Over the next three years (2013 to 2016) we look for a 13% earnings per share compound annual growth, a 1 point PE ratchet (the Primark mix effect) and for ABF to turn net cash. We will not stand in the way of a juggernaut. </blockquote> <p>Overall the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> fell 37.78 points to 6468.41 despite an opening rise on Wall Street, which was effectively playing catch-up after being closed for Monday's Labor Day holiday.</p> <p>The UK market suffered a jolt downwards in mid-morning after Russian reports of missiles being fired in the Mediterranean, renewing fears of an attack on Syria. A certain amount of calm returned when the US and Israel said it was just a test, but it was a reminder that the situation remains volatile. Later came comments from US House speaker John Boehner backing a Syria war resolution, adding to the likelihood of Congress voting for US action. Michael Hewson, senior market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said:</p> <blockquote> European markets have had a slightly less exuberant air about them today after the strong gains of yesterday as nervousness about the situation in the Middle East spilled over on reports of two ballistic missiles being fired in the Mediterranean, caused markets to slump sharply in the morning session. <br> Markets did regain their equilibrium somewhat after it was confirmed that it was a missile test by Israel but it was a timely reminder of the fluidity and uncertainty of the situation in the region, and kept investors on the back foot somewhat throughout the remainder of the day, despite some positive US economic data. </blockquote> <p><strong>Vodafone</strong> was the biggest faller, down 10.7p at 202.5p on profit taking following confirmation it had agreed to sell its stake in Verizon Wireless for $130bn.</p> <p>A second major technology deal in two days - Microsoft's purchase of Nokia's handset business - also caused some excitement, with Nokia shares sharply higher but Microsoft heading in the opposite direction.</p> <p><strong>Centrica</strong> climbed 4.2p to 393.1p as Deutsche Bank moved from hold to neutral on the British Gas owner, and raised its price target from 340p to 430p.</p> <p>But property shares came under pressure following a note on the sector from analysts at JP Morgan Cazenove.</p> <p>Its top picks included <strong>Land Securities</strong>, but even there it cut its target price from \u00a311.10 to \u00a310.40.

The bank said TalkTalk's shares had been unfairly hit by news that BT would be offering its sports channel free to its broadband customers. It said:</p> <blockquote> Over the last year, TalkTalk has beaten expectations on TV adds and churn reduction, while pricing repair continues.

      "bodyText": "As profit takers moved in after Monday's surge, amid reports of missile launches in the Mediterranean and growing support for US action in Syria, there were some bright spots. Associated British Foods added 23p to \u00a319.01 after analysts at Exane BNP Paribas raised their recommendation on the groceries, sugar and Primark business from underperform to outperform and their target price by 28% to \u00a324. The bank warned that changes in the sugar market were likely to depress profits in the sector, but ABF's other businesses - especially Primark - would take up the slack. They said: The European sugar market operates under a highly regulated regime that stifles competition. This world will end in September 2017. When it does, we see severe profit compression for all European sugar industry participants. [So] why move to outperform in an apocalypse? Put simply, the sugar bear case is dead. While the new regime will materially impact [ABF's] sugar profits (we look for a decline of around 50% in Europe), this represents only a 9% drag on the group in 2018 (when Primark will represent 63% of earnings). Over the next three years (2013 to 2016) we look for a 13% earnings per share compound annual growth, a 1 point PE ratchet (the Primark mix effect) and for ABF to turn net cash. We will not stand in the way of a juggernaut. Overall the FTSE 100 fell 37.78 points to 6468.41 despite an opening rise on Wall Street, which was effectively playing catch-up after being closed for Monday's Labor Day holiday. The UK market suffered a jolt downwards in mid-morning after Russian reports of missiles being fired in the Mediterranean, renewing fears of an attack on Syria. A certain amount of calm returned when the US and Israel said it was just a test, but it was a reminder that the situation remains volatile. Later came comments from US House speaker John Boehner backing a Syria war resolution, adding to the likelihood of Congress voting for US action. Michael Hewson, senior market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: European markets have had a slightly less exuberant air about them today after the strong gains of yesterday as nervousness about the situation in the Middle East spilled over on reports of two ballistic missiles being fired in the Mediterranean, caused markets to slump sharply in the morning session. Markets did regain their equilibrium somewhat after it was confirmed that it was a missile test by Israel but it was a timely reminder of the fluidity and uncertainty of the situation in the region, and kept investors on the back foot somewhat throughout the remainder of the day, despite some positive US economic data. Vodafone was the biggest faller, down 10.7p at 202.5p on profit taking following confirmation it had agreed to sell its stake in Verizon Wireless for $130bn. A second major technology deal in two days - Microsoft's purchase of Nokia's handset business - also caused some excitement, with Nokia shares sharply higher but Microsoft heading in the opposite direction. Centrica climbed 4.2p to 393.1p as Deutsche Bank moved from hold to neutral on the British Gas owner, and raised its price target from 340p to 430p. But property shares came under pressure following a note on the sector from analysts at JP Morgan Cazenove. Its top picks included Land Securities, but even there it cut its target price from \u00a311.10 to \u00a310.40. The company - which is also behind the Walkie Talkie building in London which appears to be focusing the sun's rays in a way which melts cars - dropped 27.5p to 881p. Cazenove reduced its target price on British Land, down 14.5p to 552.5p, from 720p to 670p, and moved Capital &amp; Counties, 10.3p lower at 314.7p, from overweight to neutral. Among the mid-caps Spirent Communications rose 6p to 134.8p after the telecoms testing company said chief executive Bill Burns was stepping down immediately, to be replaced by finance director Eric Hutchinson. The company gave no reason for the change, and said it would start the search for a new chief executive in due course. Meanwhile TalkTalk Telecom put on 5.5p to 253.5p following a positive note from JP Morgan. The bank said TalkTalk's shares had been unfairly hit by news that BT would be offering its sports channel free to its broadband customers. It said: Over the last year, TalkTalk has beaten expectations on TV adds and churn reduction, while pricing repair continues. The cost story is compelling with much still to do given its acquisitive history. Despite this, it has performed in-line with the FTSE 250 over 12 months, as overdone concerns on BT Sport weigh. We upgrade to overweight (from neutral) and increase our price target to 300p (from 225p). Elsewhere Genus, the animal genetics business, fell 131p to \u00a313.48 after underlying full year profits dropped from \u00a354.4m to \u00a338.1m reflecting a fall in biological assets.

Of course, getting businesses to entertain this idea \u2013 and they will naturally be resistant \u2013 will require a lot of work. They'll want clear assurances that the fund would be wisely spent. It would have to be administered by trustees that include some of the biggest contributors. There's no denying though that this is achievable. The biggest businesses can and should take it upon themselves to do what government has failed to do: give our high street, a great British institution admired the world over, a fighting chance of not just surviving but building a new model at the heart of communities that will last. \u2022 Bill Grimsey, the former boss of now defunct DIY chain Focus and Big Food Group, the former owner of the Iceland food retailer, launches the Grimsey review, an assessment of the problems for the high street, on Wednesday",

      "bodyText": "Paris-based thinktank the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has lifted its forecast for UK growth in 2013, in the latest vote of confidence for the fledgling recovery. In May, when it last released projections for the world's major economies, the OECD was expecting 0.8% growth in the UK for 2013. On Tuesday, it said recent survey evidence suggested GDP would expand by 1.5%, grouping the UK with the US and Japan as economies where, \"activity is expanding at encouraging rates\". The upgrade from the OECD comes after a string of positive indicators for the UK, including stronger-than-expected growth of 0.7% in the second quarter, falling unemployment, and survey evidence suggesting the strongest growth in manufacturing output for almost two decades. Alongside revising up its forecast for the UK, the OECD used its interim economic assessment to warn that while a moderate recovery is underway in many major economies, global growth remains sluggish, and there are still risks to the upturn. The OECD's economists single out the impact of the Federal Reserve's plans to phase out its massive programme of quantitative easing as creating particular problems for some economies. \"In many emerging economies, loss of domestic activity momentum together with the shift in expectations about the course of monetary policy in the United States and the ensuing rise in global bond yields have led to significant market instability, rising financing costs, capital outflows and currency depreciations,\" it said. Countries including India, Indonesia, Brazil and Turkey have been battling to control a potentially destabilising decline in their currencies since the Fed chairman, Ben Bernanke, announced his plans to \"taper\" QE in May. The OECD's experts warn that the slowdown in emerging economies \u2013 which have been major drivers of world growth in recent years \u2013 would offset the improvement in advanced economies, so that the global recovery would continue to be, \"sluggish\". In the US, the OECD expects growth to be 1.7% in 2013, slightly down on its May estimate of 1.9%. It also warns that the crisis in the eurozone is far from over, saying: \"The euro area remains vulnerable to renewed financial, banking and sovereign debt tensions. Many euro area banks are insufficiently capitalised and weighed down by bad loans.\"",

The company gave no reason, and said Burns would help make a smooth transition. He would receive a payment in line with his contract. In due course, Spirent said it would start the search for a new chief executive. Analyst George O'Connor at Panmure Gordon said:</p> <blockquote> News that the chief executive departs is disappointing given that after a poor start there have been some positives from the company - note the second quarter book-to-bill. Also, comments from peers (namely Ixia and Anite) suggest that the operational weakness is primarily market driven. <br> Some will see the news as a portent of a poor order build for the third quarter; however, in our view it is more likely a degree of frustration at the pace of change and possibly failure to use the balance sheet more aggressively to hold the share price - compare and contrast with (say) the management teams at Micro Focus, Sage, Fidessa and Computacenter which have all used cash to prop up the share price.  We note that Spirent's board composition has backgrounds at Sherborne Investors and The Carlyle Group - but also, very pleasingly, Sue Swenson. Sue is best known for 'fixing' Sage US, and has a very strong Telecoms pedigree - she can either pick the candidate or, even better, do the job herself. Mr Hutchinson, appointed January 2000, is a very safe pair of hands, who knows the company inside and outside and should do a good job in the meantime. Yes, investors will be cautious on the news, but we retain our buy and 169p target price. </blockquote> <p>Meanwhile TalkTalk has jumped 11.6p to 259.6p following a positive note from JP Morgan. The bank said TalkTalk's shares had been unfairly hit by news that BT would be offering its sports channel free to its broadband customers. It said:</p> <blockquote> Over the last year, TalkTalk has beaten expectations on TV adds and churn reduction, while pricing repair continues. The cost story is compelling with much still to do given its acquisitive history. Despite this, it has performed in-line with the FTSE 250 over 12 months, as overdone concerns on BT Sport weigh. We upgrade to overweight (from neutral) and increase our price target to 300p (from 225p). <br> </blockquote> <p>Overall, leading shares have made a cautious start after Monday's surge on positive manufacturing surveys around the globe. The <strong>FTSE 100</strong> has lost early gains and is currently 2.65p lower at 6503.54.</p> <p><strong>Land Securities</strong> is down 16.5p at 892p as JP Morgan edged down its price target from \u00a311.10 to \u00a310.40 but kept its overweight rating.</p> <p>Vodafone has fallen 2.95p to 210.15p as profit takers moved in following Monday's confirmation after the market closed that it had agreed to sell its stake in Verizon Wireless for $130bn. Ronnie Chopra, head of strategy at Tradenext, said:</p> <blockquote> The massive dividend for shareholders of Vodafone seemed to be ignored by the market which seems rather surprising...the possible predators stalking telecom companies should make the UK telco giant on the radar of many.
