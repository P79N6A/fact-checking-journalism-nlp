      "bodyText": "Marks &amp; Spencer is expected to defy the high street gloom by delivering its first increase in clothing sales at Christmas for six years. M&amp;S is among the big retailers lining up this week to reveal sales over the critical trading period. Major supermarkets Morrisons and Tesco, as well as department store chain John Lewis, are expected to have weathered the storm but groups exposed to a tough clothing market and a steep decline in high street shoppers have suffered. After only one Christmas in charge, M&amp;S chief executive Steve Rowe is expected to report a small increase in like-for-like clothing sales in the third quarter aided by the inclusion of extra sale trading days in the period. Cold weather at was also helpful after 2015\u2019s mild conditions dented demand for coats and knitwear. Last week\u2019s dismal figures from Next, which wiped \u00a32bn off retailers\u2019 share price on the day, fuelled fears that Christmas 2016 was a washout for clothing retailers as Britons cut spending on clothing. But while the upset at Next capped a long period of financial outperformance, M&amp;S\u2019s progress follows five years of dire figures, with clothing sales down nearly 6% over the last two Christmases. Independent retail analyst Nick Bubb predicted a 3.7% increase in like-for-like sales at John Lewis for the six weeks to 31 December, a figure underpinned by the strength of its click and collect business. But Bubb fears heavy discounting in the Christmas run up will have eaten into the employee-owned retailer\u2019s profits. John Lewis\u2019s \u201cnever knowingly undersold\u201d promise means it has to match rivals\u2019 price cuts. \u201cThe worry is that increased discounting/price matching will have cost John Lewis quite a bit of gross margin,\u201d said Bubb. \u201cAlso the skewing of sales growth to online will have been expensive in terms of fulfilment and distribution costs.\u201d Although the UK clothing market is in decline, Retail Economics analyst Richard Lim predicts Britons will have spent \u00a3700m more in December than in 2015, a 1.7% increase that will push takings for the month to \u00a342.1bn. \u201cOverall I think retailers had a reasonable but not spectacular Christmas,\u201d he said. \u201cAlthough the conditions for 2017 look bleak, consumers told us the Brexit vote has not had an impact on their incomes yet.\u201d The speed at which sales are transferring from physical stores to a digital high street is one of the biggest trends weighing on retailers with extensive store networks. According to the association for online retailers IMRG, online sales increased 21.2% in November compared with a year ago. The \u00a316.5bn spent in November was the biggest ever monthly spend, pushing online takings to \u00a3118.5bn for the first 11 months of the year. While established retailers such as M&amp;S and Debenhams struggle to eke out growth \u2013 analysts predict underlying sales at constant currency exchange rates will be down 1% at Debenhams \u2013 online fashion sites Asos and Boohoo are riding the online boom, with growth rates of 30% and more than 40%, respectively. \u201cM&amp;S is still very much in recovery mode under Steve Rowe,\u201d said David Jeary, an analyst at Canaccord Genuity. \u201cI\u2019m still nervous in terms of their experience on the clothing front. Some people are looking for a small positive increase in like-for-like sales but I\u2019m not persuaded of that and think it will be a small negative number.\u201d Analyst predictions on the performance of M&amp;S\u2019s key clothing business range from a 2% decline to a 1.5% rise. Its food business is expected to deliver a small decline in underlying sales. \u201cIf they delivered another 6% decline [on clothing] the market would clobber them,\u201d said Jeary. With food a key component of the Christmas spending spree analysts are optimistic that, as in 2015, the major supermarket chains will deliver decent figures, with Morrisons leading the pack amid its renaissance under chief executive David Potts. The City has pencilled in like-for-like sales growth of 1.1% for the 9 weeks to 1 January for the Bradford-based grocer. Bernstein analyst Bruno Monteyne said Morrisons would be the \u201crelative winner\u201d of the listed pack with growth of 2.5%. Growth at Aldi and Lidl slowed towards the end of 2016 but Monteyne predicted the discounters will have gained market share in December. Market leader Tesco is also expected to have traded well but it is up against strong figures compared with last year. As a result James Anstead, an analyst at Barclays, one of the grocer\u2019s house brokers, predicted like-for-like sales will be flat over the six-week Christmas trading period. At Sainsbury\u2019s, the UK\u2019s second largest grocer, analysts have pencilled in a 0.8% fall in like-for-like sales and growth of 1.6% at its Argos chain \u2013 although the latter\u2019s profit margins could have been damaged by a fierce price war on toys with Tesco.",

      "bodyText": "It took the Queen to show that the emperor had no clothes. On a visit to the London School of Economics in November 2008, when a second Great Depression was looming large, she asked a simple but devastating question: why did nobody see it coming? Almost a decade later, the Queen might be tempted to lob another grenade at the economics fraternity: why did you get it wrong again about Brexit? In fairness, the economics profession had its Cassandras in the run-up to the financial crisis and not all economists thought a vote to leave on 23 June meant instant Armageddon. Even so, it is a valid question. How can it be that the Bank of England, the Treasury, the IMF, the OECD, not to mention the vast majority of academic economists, all predicted so confidently and yet so wrongly that the UK economy would plunge straight into a stonking great recession after a Brexit vote? On both occasions, economists have been guilty of groupthink. On both occasions they pretend to have forecasting powers that don\u2019t really exist. As the economist Paul Ormerod points out, in the short term it is nigh-on impossible to sort out genuine information from noise. Andy Haldane, the chief economist at the Bank of England, last week compared his profession to poor old Michael Fish, who insisted there would be no hurricane on the eve of the biggest storm to hit southern England in living memory. Meteorology has moved on in the past three decades: the use of satellite technology has made forecasting more reliable. The same cannot be said of economic forecasting, which is no better now than it was half a century ago. The models, however sophisticated, don\u2019t work awfully well, particularly when big shocks occur. And that, of course, is when they are needed most. The \u201cgreat moderation\u201d \u2013 the period in the 1990s and 2000s when growth was steady and inflation low \u2013 lulled economists into a false sense of security. There are lessons to be learned. The past is not a reliable guide to the future. The consensus is not always right. Economic forecasting is not a hard science, even though it pretends that it is. The fallback position for those who said the sky would instantly fall in after the referendum is that they were right about everything apart from the timing. Armageddon has been postponed, not cancelled. The consensus is that in the long term there will be a sizable and permanent hit to the economy from Brexit, caused by a loss of trade and inward investment. The Treasury\u2019s central forecast is that the cost of leaving the EU is an economy that will be 6% smaller in 2030 than it would be under the status quo. Yet models are only as good as the information they process: garbage in equals garbage out. The garbage factor increases if forecasts are designed to serve a political end, as was the case with both sides during the referendum campaign. A new Cambridge University study* shows that forecasting the medium to long term can be just as prone to error as forecasting the short term. Their argument is simple. Leaving the EU is a unique event. No other country has tried to do it. There is no past experience to draw on, which means that the best forecasters can do is construct \u201ca series of scenarios based on assumptions about future trading arrangements, migration controls and about the short-term uncertainties which could affect business investment in the run-up to the likely leaving date of 2019\u201d. This is what the Treasury purportedly did in its study of the long-term impact of leaving the EU, published last April. It concluded that leaving, but remaining a member of the single market, would carry a 3.8% of GDP cost after 15 years; leaving with a negotiated bilateral trade deal would cost 6.2%; while having access to the single market on the same terms as any other member of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) would cost of 7.5% of GDP. The Treasury used what is known as gravity modelling to come to these conclusions. So do other forecasters, such as the IMF, which is why once they have all crunched the numbers they all come up with the same result. Gravity modelling is Newtonian physics adapted for economic forecasting. Just as the attraction between two heavenly bodies is directly proportional to their masses and inversely proportional to the distance between them, so the volume of trade and the amount of foreign direct investment between two countries depends on how big and how geographically close they are. Using this approach, the Treasury says there would be a 43% loss of trade with the EU were the UK to revert to WTO rules, and because almost half the UK\u2019s trade is with the EU this would result in a 24% loss in total trade. The assumption is that there has been a 76% increase in UK trade as a result of membership of the EU and that all of these gains would be lost. There would be no gains in trade with non-EU countries to compensate for the loss. How plausible is this? Not very, according to the Cambridge economists. They note that the share of UK exports going to Europe peaked in the late 1980s and has been falling in recent years as a result of weak demand in the eurozone. EU external tariffs average only 3% and the Treasury forecasts take no account of movements in the exchange rate. The Cambridge paper estimates that the 15% drop in the value of sterling since the referendum would be enough to offset the impact of a 10% external tariff on cars, which perhaps explains why the government has been able to persuade Nissan to build a new model in Sunderland. The paper expresses similar doubts about the Treasury forecasts for inward investment, since they are heavily influenced by the wave of capital attracted by the ultra-cheap labour on offer in eastern Europe after the collapse of communism. Using different but still relatively pessimistic assumptions, the Cambridge study says the loss peaks at 3% of GDP early in the 2020s. The loss of GDP per head is smaller \u2013 never much more than 1% \u2013 and soon recovers. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, would do well to have a squint at the Cambridge paper, since its findings are much more in tune with the May government\u2019s view about how the economy will perform after Brexit. It will, of course, still be the same economy \u2013 warts and all. *The macro-economic impact of Brexit; Graham Gudgin, Ken Coutts and Neil Gibson; Centre for Business Research; Cambridge University, working paper No 483",

The Cambridge paper estimates that the 15% drop in the value of sterling since the referendum would be enough to offset the impact of a 10% external tariff on cars, which perhaps explains why the government has been able to persuade Nissan to build a new model in Sunderland.</p> <p>The paper expresses similar doubts about the Treasury forecasts for inward investment, since they are heavily influenced by the wave of capital attracted by the ultra-cheap labour on offer in eastern Europe after the collapse of communism.</p> <p>Using different but still relatively pessimistic assumptions, the Cambridge study says the loss peaks at 3% of GDP early in the 2020s. The loss of GDP per head is smaller \u2013 never much more than 1% \u2013 and soon recovers.</p> <p>The chancellor, Philip Hammond, would do well to have a squint at the Cambridge paper, since its findings are much more in tune with the May government\u2019s view about how the economy will perform after Brexit. It will, of course, still be the same economy \u2013 warts and all.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p><em><a href=\"http://www.cbr.cam.ac.uk/fileadmin/user_upload/centre-for-business-research/downloads/working-papers/wp483revised.pdf\">*The macro-economic impact of Brexit; Graham Gudgin, Ken Coutts and Neil Gibson; Centre for Business Research; Cambridge University, working paper No 483</a></em></p>",

      "bodyText": "Consumer debt has raised its ugly head again. According to the latest figures, the total has soared back to a level last seen just before the 2008 financial crash. To the untrained eye, the dramatic increase in spending using credit cards and loans might appear to prefigure a disaster of epic proportions. Excessive consumer debt played a big part in the collapse of Northern Rock, and looking back, this landmark banking disaster appears to have been the harbinger of an even bigger catastrophe when, a year later, Lehman Brothers fell over. This is not a view shared by the Bank of England, which says it need only keep a watching brief. Its complacency is born of forecasts of the ratio between household debt and GDP made by the Office for Budget Responsibility. At the moment, the household debt to GDP ratio is around 140%, compared with almost 170% in 2008. The OBR\u2019s latest analysis predicts that, over the next five years, the combination of consumer and mortgage debt will rise only gradually and fall well short of its pre-crisis peak. There is nothing wrong with judging household debt as a proportion of annual national income to gauge sustainability and the likelihood that borrowers can afford to pay it back. There is nothing wrong with it as long as you assume that GDP has been evenly shared out since the crash and that the people doing the borrowing have higher incomes, thanks to the higher GDP, to cope with repayments. Except that the Bank of England knows most people\u2019s incomes have flatlined for years. It need look no further than official figures, which make it clear that the vast majority have missed out on the gains from GDP growth. Incomes per head have barely recovered since 2008 and are only marginally ahead. Figures put together by the TUC last year from the official annual survey of hours and earnings paint an even gloomier picture. If they are only half right, the capacity of workers on low and average pay to manage debt payments is significantly diminished. It has estimated that, nationally, workers are more than \u00a32,000 a year worse off after inflation is taken into account than they were in 2008 and more than \u00a34,000 worse off in London. This should tell the central bank and the Treasury that a rise to \u00a3192bn in unsecured consumer debt in November \u2013 only a little short of the \u00a3208bn peak \u2013 is most definitely a cause for concern. And it therefore makes no sense to brush aside fears about rising debt levels by pointing to higher GDP. A debt-to-GDP figure is just not that relevant when the incomes of the people taking on the debt are stagnant. Threadneedle Street has a second point to make, which is that banks can cope with the debts after years spent shoring up reserves, and a third line of defence, which highlights the lower cost of servicing outstanding debts. Also, the most recent figures show the stock of unsecured credit equalled around 15% of households\u2019 disposable incomes in the third quarter, well below the peak of 21.2% in 2005. And it might also be suggested that the 10.8% growth in consumer credit in November remains below the peak of 21.5% in 1988. All this is true, except that using a growth-rate figure from the 1980s is akin to charting electric car production today \u2013 the percentage growth rate is accelerating from a low base. And figures for the stock of unsecured lending would be more relevant were it not for the fact that the economy is now more divided than ever before, and especially between young and old. Baby boomers who have excessive savings and low debts have very different concerns to young families who struggle with low savings and excessive debts. The situation is also likely to get worse. Disposable incomes are going to be squeezed next year as wages rise at a slower rate than prices in the shops, putting even more pressure on consumers to rely on credit. A downturn in the savings ratio has already pointed to weaker household finances. Banks, credit card companies and car loan providers are all offering mouthwatering rates to attract customers. Some, like Lloyds Bank, which wants to buy the credit card firm MBNA, are striving to gain market share and hoover up even more debt-laden customers than the competition. You might think that low interest rates, which undoubtedly keep millions of families afloat, also serve to push many families deeper into debt. You would be right. You might also question who is going to call time on them. The Bank of England is compromised now it has added the role of the chief financial regulator to its interest-rate-setting job. Why would it allow criticism by a regulator it controls of its own interest-rate policy? The Treasury is unlikely to step in when it needs spending on credit to continue or risk a recession. Brexit and the uncertainty it creates means ministers must feed the credit monster, whatever the longer-term consequences.",

      "bodyText": "When thousands of bankers reportedly disappear, a special committee is called in to investigate. Will it solve the mystery and save the UK economy? Or have the City jobs vanished forever? That all sounds like a case for superintendent Andrew Fenwick, the hero of the acclaimed crime novels of Elizabeth Corley, who in her far more tedious career is also vice-chair of Allianz Global Investors. The premise would be quite neat, of course, as she will be up in front of the Treasury select committee on Tuesday, to talk about the UK\u2019s future economic relationship with the European Union. Corley\u2019s appearance \u2013 along with HSBC chairman Douglas Flint and London Stock Exchange boss Xavier Rolet \u2013 comes as City firms hint that they are planning to shift loads of jobs to Europe in the wake of the UK\u2019s Brexit vote (aka, seeing what concessions they can get out of the government). Last week, Andrew Gray, head of Brexit at PricewaterhouseCoopers, which is advising several financial institutions on this matter, said announcements could start in late February. This must have rather irritated Corley\u2019s fellow panellist Flint, whose bank once enjoyed a near-monopoly on making threats about leaving the UK. Now his rivals have brazenly nicked his ruse. Another case for Fenwick, perhaps? Bonus ball goes on This week marks the start of the most serious banking stress tests of them all \u2013 the ones where the strain put on bankers\u2019 braces, as they trouser annual bonuses, is scrutinised to the full. Yes, it is the beginning of the banking reporting season, where no one takes much notice of profits, but instead focuses on the far more important issue of how much these delightfully self-effacing characters have earned for themselves. JP Morgan kicks off a season that sees bankers sashaying along the corridor to the boss\u2019s office to be given their \u201cnumber\u201d \u2013 a number that dictates what flash motor they can buy \u2013 and how much the rest of us love them for it. Last year is not expected to be unveiled as a blockbuster for bonuses, but even average years for this trade look like stellar ones for mere mortals. Meanwhile, bonuses never seem to vanish when bankers make a complete Horlicks of things and shave a few points off GDP. Or as JP Morgan boss Jamie Dimon, once put it: \u201cI want to acknowledge our mistakes ... and try to stop stepping in dogshit \u2013 which we do every now and then.\u201d Retail\u2019s moment of truth Total like-for-like sales were down by 0.1% in December from a very weak base of minus 5.3% in December 2015. At the time, that was the worst monthly result seen since 2008. Yes \u2013 that\u2019s the cheery new year\u2019s message for the retail sector delivered by BDO on Friday, via its high street sales tracker report. The gloomy news from the accountancy firm tied in rather neatly with a similar downbeat statement last week by Next \u2013 once the darling of the retailing sector \u2013 where boss Lord Wolfson\u2019s usual cautious setting veered towards dejection. Wolfson said that the slowdown in spending on clothing and footwear, which began in November 2015, was likely to continue this year, while the retailer\u2019s post-Christmas sale (frequently cited as the textbook example of how to do such things) had flopped. That doesn\u2019t mean that everyone else on the high street had a shocker, of course, but we\u2019ll have a better idea of who did after an action-packed series of announcements this week. We have trading statements from Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s and Morrisons, plus a host of more general retailers including Joules, SuperGroup, Marks &amp; Spencer, Debenhams, Booker, Ted Baker and Dunelm.",

This must have rather irritated Corley\u2019s fellow panellist Flint, whose bank once enjoyed a near-monopoly on making threats about leaving the UK.

Meanwhile, bonuses never seem to vanish when bankers make a complete Horlicks of things and shave a few points off GDP.</p> <p>Or as JP Morgan boss Jamie Dimon, once put it: \u201cI want to acknowledge our mistakes ... and try to stop stepping in dogshit \u2013 which we do every now and then.\u201d</p> <h2>Retail\u2019s moment of truth</h2> <p>Total like-for-like sales were down by 0.1% in December from a very weak base of minus 5.3% in December 2015.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "When the Bank of England looks around in a couple of years to replace Mark Carney as governor, Andy Haldane will need to work hard to win over the selection panel. The central bank\u2019s chief economist can\u2019t help attracting publicity, and not always in a good way. Last week he was in hot water following his capitulation to the bullying Brexiters and their claim that experts were dunces. He said it was \u201ca fair cop\u201d in answer to critics who accuse his profession of missing the financial crisis and misjudging the impact of the Brexit vote. The Bank certainly did fail to highlight the oncoming juggernaut of debt that overwhelmed the west in 2008. And now, post-Brexit, all is calm in the British economy where Threadneedle Street said there would be turmoil. As for a recession sometime soon, which the Treasury said was a possibility, there is not a sliver of evidence. If anything, the economy is one of the fastest growing in the developed world. These specific errors call for an apology. Experts are under the spotlight now and need to examine their conduct, especially when they become partial and are undone by facts they sweep under the carpet or ignore. But Haldane went further than just apologising for discrete mistakes. And worse, he made some bizarre comparisons that will make those concerned about the demise of experts think he is part of the problem. He said that the 2008 crash was economic forecasting\u2019s \u201cMichael Fish moment\u201d, referring to the BBC weatherman\u2019s infamous dismissal of hurricane warnings in 1987 that were soon proved all too accurate across southern England. He carried the analogy through to the Met Office\u2019s solution, which was to include more data, more quickly, into its forecasting system. This brought about a huge improvement in weather predictions that economists could copy, claimed Haldane. Yet it is not clear why more data would make a difference when it was institutional myopia that was behind the Bank\u2019s embarrassing ignorance of an unstable financial system in 2008. Furthermore, Haldane said the forecasts of doom and gloom ahead of the Brexit vote were also wrong, even though the Bank was right about the fall in sterling and will be proved right about its limited impact on exports and significant impact on inflation, leading to slowing growth. It was only wrong about the strength of consumer borrowing, which was partly due to a misreading of the ultra-low loan rates on offer that make spending on credit so seductive. Haldane\u2019s Bank also failed to tell politicians, the City and the public that if there were a post-referendum panic, it would probably cut interest rates again and boost its stimulus package. The fact that it pulled the trigger on both these measures when the situation looked sticky is one reason consumer confidence has bounced back and the economy has recovered. He didn\u2019t mention that either. And he didn\u2019t emphasise the inherent uncertainty surrounding economic forecasts. For instance, exports could be higher than expected, and the economy grow faster this year than the widely forecast 1%, as a result of the promised spending spree by Donald Trump when he gets into the Oval Office. All boats will float on a tide of US munificence that could scarcely have been foreseen last year, when the polls put Trump well behind Clinton. Where Haldane hit the spot was in his critique of economics teaching. It is too narrow, it relies on equations to explain a world where many things don\u2019t add up, and it lacks historical perspective. Maybe universities can rescue the situation by developing a fresh cohort of economists with a broader and more grounded outlook. So Haldane may have been too harsh on his profession: but he is right that change is needed. Is Ashley in need of anger management? Was Mike Ashley\u2019s new year resolution to stop being so conciliatory? That quality hasn\u2019t often been attached to Sports Direct\u2019s founder, chief executive and 55% shareholder but, by his standards, 2016 was a year of peace, love and reconciliation. He turned up to Iain Wright\u2019s business select committee, confounding some expectations. He apologised for \u201cserious shortcomings\u201d in working practices in the Shirebrook warehouse and launched a governance review. He pledged to raise standards, to offer all retail staff guaranteed hours instead of zero-hours contracts and that an elected workers\u2019 representative would join the board. Ashley even held an open day at Shirebrook in September for all to witness the dawn of Sports Direct\u2019s new \u201copen and compliant\u201d era. And now? In the first week of 2017, Ashley performed three U-turns in one day. The first was merely odd: Sports Direct will resume share buybacks after abandoning them only a month ago. But the other two announcements suggested the old belligerence is back. Ashley said he had asked chairman Keith Hellawell to reconsider his pledge to resign if outside shareholders vote against his reappointment next September. That was a big \u201cup yours\u201d to those who had just voted against Hellawell for a second time. Then Ashley said the board would reconsider \u201call options\u201d in its governance review \u201cin view of continuing frustrations\u201d. Whose frustrations? Outside investors\u2019 or his? It wasn\u2019t clear, but one option for the review is to abandon the idea of appointing an independent figure to lead it. Review arrangements are under discussion with the Investor Forum, representing City fund managers, and dialogue was described as \u201cconstructive\u201d before Christmas. But that was before the latest vote against Hellawell. Ashley could be making a mistake. A bunker mentality helped push Sports Direct into last year\u2019s crisis. A big sulk wouldn\u2019t improve matters now. Governance reform is harder that it sounds. Sometimes it involves hearing judgments you may not like. Still decking the halls Christmas is over \u2013 but not for City bankers. They are about to find out the size of their annual bonuses. The US banks traditionally go first: JP Morgan and Bank of America report results \u2013 and the size of their bonus pools \u2013 this week, with Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley to follow. All have sizable London operations. The European banks will follow suit a few weeks later. Bankers insist that the bonus season is not what was it before the 2008 crisis. Then they got their payouts in lump sum cash amounts or, going back 20 years or so, in gold bars to take the sting out of taxes. These days bonuses are partly paid in shares and spread over a number of years. Even so, the rewards are big. Data for 2015 shows the big four US banks handing \u20ac1m to almost 1,000 City workers. The rainmakers are also raking it in. Three employees at boutique Robey Warshaw shared \u00a337m for their efforts advising on big takeovers. That\u2019s all their Christmases at once.",
