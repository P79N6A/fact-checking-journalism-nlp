    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The arrest of one of Russia's richest men last week was an attempt by President Vladimir Putin to protect himself from a palace coup, according to one of his most vocal critics. Bill Browder, the hedge fund manager who has become a crusader against Russian corruption, said the arrest of Vladimir Yevtushenkov was intended to send a message to any oligarch plotting moves against Putin, as the value of their assets drops in the wake of western sanctions. Yevtushenkov was released on Friday, after being put under house arrest for three days on charges of money laundering. As the richest man to fall into the hands of the Russian justice system since Mikhail Khodorkovsky was arrested in 2003, Yevtushenkov's detention heightened speculation that the Kremlin wanted to take control of his oil company, Bashneft \u2013 one of the few Russian energy companies still in private ownership. Speaking before Yevtushenkov's release, Browder said the arrest was \"more motivated by paranoia than any demand for a particular asset\", because \"Putin and his underlings can always steal these assets in any number of ways\". \"I don't know if Yevtushenkov did anything more or less irritating to Putin than the other oligarchs. I just think [Putin] randomly picked one out to make sure none of the other oligarchs are going to start challenging him or start planning any palace coups. \"Now that their wealth has been diminished by Putin's actions, they have a big incentive to act against Putin and he knows that.\" Russia's main stock market, Micex, has lost 6% of its value since the west tightened economic sanctions against Russia in July over its threat to the sovereignty of Ukraine, and the value of the rouble has fallen to all-time lows against the dollar. Browder is seeking to hold to account low-level Russian officials whom he believes are responsible for the death of his lawyer, Sergei Magnitsky, who died in a Moscow jail in 2009 a year after reporting a massive tax fraud to the authorities. Browder himself was blacklisted by the Russian government in 2006 after 10 years of investing in the country through his Hermitage Capital Management fund. He says he has traced $200m (\u00a3123m) of the $230m missing under the tax fraud scheme and is seeking to get the European Union to follow the United States in banning suspected perpetrators from their territory and freezing their assets. Browder said he was hopeful that one of the EU's 28 member states would put the issue on the agenda before the end of the year. However, he is critical of western countries for having been slow to respond to the crisis in Ukraine. \"We would be in a much less dangerous situation if they had gone for targeted sanctions with broad lists of Putin cronies at the very get-go,\" he said. Western sanctions are already weighing on Russia's weak economy. The former finance minister Alexei Kudrin recently warned that the government would struggle to help state companies frozen out of western money markets as the economy slides deeper into stagnation. Yevtushenkov's arrest heightened alarm among Russian business people already uneasy about sanctions. German Gref, an economic liberal who leads state banking giant Sberbank, described it as a tragedy that would have a negative impact on Russia's business climate, while the leader of the main business union collected signatures to petition for Yevtushenkov's release. The influence of economic liberals in the country has diminished since the onset of the Ukraine crisis, which has bolstered the position of the Kremlin's hawkish siloviki faction of officials with a background in national security. \"Putin's calculus in Ukraine is not economic but geopolitical, so naturally the influence of the liberals has diminished,\" said Alexander Kliment at the political risk consultancy Eurasia Group. He has observed a deterioration in the business climate over the past year \u2013 an area where Russia has never scored highly on international rankings. And as business slows down, the fight for the spoils is intensifying. \"As the economic pie starts to shrink, everyone is sharpening their knives. Those who are closer to the Kremlin will do better than those who are not, and Yevtushenkov was not as close to the Kremlin as others.\" While many observers \u2013 including Khodorkovsky himself \u2013 have drawn parallels to the Yukos case, in which the oil company owned by Khordorkovsky was forcibly broken up over alleged unpaid taxes, Kliment sees some important differences. Khodorkovsky was arrested at a time when Russia was trying to rebuild its national resources, when oil prices and incomes were rising. Now oil prices are falling and the economy is practically in recession. \"The Russian elite is starting to cannibalise itself.\"",

      "body": "<p>Made in America.</p> <p>With the prevalence of outsourcing factory work to Bangladesh and China, fewer retailers can use those three short words on popular clothing. </p> <p>There is one who thought of going the China route, then turned back to Made in the USA: Bayard Winthrop, founder of <a href=\"http://www.american-giant.com/\">American Giant</a>.</p> <p>American Giant sweatshirts are the darlings of Silicon Valley techies. After Farhad Manjoo, then a writer for Slate, wrote a piece heralding Winthrop\u2019s sweatshirt as the \u201c<a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2012/12/american_giant_hoodie_this_is_the_greatest_sweatshirt_known_to_man.html\">greatest hoodie ever made</a>\u201d, the company sold out of its entire stock within 36 hours. After a few months, the company <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2013/03/american_giant_hoodie_the_only_problem_with_the_world_s_greatest_sweatshirt.html\">increased its production capacity 15 to 20 times what it was previously</a> and the greatest hoodie ever made was back in stock.</p> <p>It\u2019s a fallacy, Winthrop says, that in order to purchase an American-made product consumers either have to sacrifice quality or put up with high prices. When he considered factories in China, \u201cI realized I was chasing the cheapest material, the cheapest labor,\u201d he explains to the Guardian.</p> <p>With main offices in San Francisco and staff of about 23, Winthrop works with five US-based factories to make basic wear like sweatshirts, shirts and now even sweatpants. Two of the factories are based in California, three in North Carolina.</p> <p>\u201cPeople want to buy American made products,\u201d says Winthrop. \u201cSweatshirts, particularly, are an iconic American wear and no brand had owned or done a particularly good job with it\u201d.</p> <p>North Carolina \u201cis <a href=\"http://blog.sfgate.com/chronstyle/2013/10/24/american-giant-ceo-reflects-on-sudden-popularity-boom-shipping-delays/\">still a million times easier</a> than Shenzen,\u201d he has told reporters.</p> <p>This stance is surprising in our era of gleeful corporate outsourcing, but perhaps not a shock coming from Winthrop himself, who is descended from several American giants himself. Although he never mentions it, Winthrop\u2019s family counts itself among the original Puritan English migrants who established the city of Boston. His forebears helped found the Massachusetts Bay Colony, starting with John Winthrop, who was described as a \u201cFreedom Man\u201d by Ronald Reagan; subsequent Winthrops were civil war generals and prominent bankers. Even though he did not grow up with that side of the family, American patriotism might reasonably be expected of him.</p> <p>Despite this when Winthrop launched his company in early 2012, he wasn\u2019t answering one of the many calls from Barack Obama to create more American-made products. He had a \u201cone of those learning moments, just out of the blue,\u201d that creating sweatshirts in foreign factories would undermine the company\u2019s \u201cbrand values and quality.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cConsumers were learning about brands in a fundamentally new way. They were telling friends about it. They were communicating via social word of mouth. Print ads were being replaced,\u201d he explains. \u201cPeople were pulled in not by huge full-page ads, but by word-of-mouth. Consumers were saying that they are increasingly trusting their peers to tell them about what\u2019s happening out there.\u201d</p> <p>We caught up with Winthrop to talk about running a Made in America company and all that that entails. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-4314cf46-40ea-4736-872c-0be228496df6\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/8/24/1408906341499/25a32391-e2e1-45af-a529-926d0b263f4b-460x307.jpeg\" alt=\"Us Money Global Edge American Giant Bayard Winthrop\" width=\"460\" height=\"307\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">American Giant founder Bayard Winthrop. Photograph: Courtesy of American Giant</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Did you ever imagine that you would be running and managing a clothing company?</strong></p> <p>I grew up in a family that had a pretty well-off father and a mother that was not well-off. My parents divorced when I was young and my dad paid for my education, but not much else. I had a pretty gold-plated New England-education but at home, it was different. I think I was aware of that at the time \u2013 but looking back at that, it gave me a certain amount of drive and passion about wanting to prove myself financially.</p> <p>Right out of college, I ended up going into corporate-finance, investment banking and Wall Street stuff, but I pretty quickly, in that process, met business leaders and found myself getting energized and inspired by the businesses that we were watching. At that point, I knew that I wanted to be running a business. I was very interested in making things and so I knew I wanted to be in manufacturing business.</p> <p>One thing I will say, I grew up in the 70s and my mom on her budget was able to buy me a US-made sweatshirt that was of the best quality in the world, that she could afford. It would last forever. And 40 years later, when you got an iPhone in your pocket that can play every song, do a conference call, order you a car, buy you groceries, we no longer as a nation have the ability to make that sweatshirt in the US. I always had a bit of chip on my shoulder about that. There is so much pressure on manufacturers, cost cutting, on US laborers, but no one has stepped back and taken a critical look at where all of the \u201cspend\u201d is.</p> <p>I was always sort of annoyed and aware of that, but I don\u2019t think I ever said that I am going to one day make a \u2018Made in America\u2019 a viable business model. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-0d5aa65d-0dfc-4ff4-98bb-f4f9a7dcc6bb\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/8/24/1408906166337/899564ec-bd67-4442-aad6-915f1d195a43-336x420.jpeg\" alt=\"US Money global edge American giant jackets \" width=\"336\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A quote by American professional boxer, Joe Frazier, on the wall of the American Giant office.

It builds understanding of how important financials are, but also that was a particularly vigorous and demanding job to have right out of college. It taught me quickly to work hard, to work accurately, to know what you are talking about. </p> <p><strong>Is it easy to communicate your values to your staff? Does your culture support that?</strong><br></p> <p>An interesting thing happens organizationally when you simplify an organization. A company like Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, for example, which has huge marketing disciplines, huge real estate disciplines, huge supply chain disciplines, one of the hallmark of these commerce business is that they can have much linear organization with people focusing on a narrower set of things that are critical to the businesses and making the business really go.</p> <p>The staff working at American Giant is intimately involved with really either product or customers. The way that we communicate with our people, we really empower folks. We basically have an internal pride in the organization as a whole. There is maximum value to our customers, strip away everything else. <br></p> <p>The empowering and the ability to make these decisions gets pushed down in the organization. My customer service team is completely empowered to override a replacement sweatshirt if the customer gets the sweatshirt in the wrong color. Or they send a gift certificate as a thank you for supporting us. <br></p> <p>There is an awful lot of employee empowerment that allows the people at American Giant to be directly responsible for how we do as a company. There\u2019s lot of real sense of pride, ownership and clarity in what we do.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"US Money Global Edge American Giant video\">  <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/739PRM0VOwI?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p><strong>You had your mini-Oprah moment when Farhad [Manjoo] wrote a piece about your sweatshirt, calling it <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2012/12/american_giant_hoodie_this_is_the_greatest_sweatshirt_known_to_man.html\">the greatest hoodie ever made</a> and you saw an significant increase in demand for your product.

      "bodyText": "Made in America. With the prevalence of outsourcing factory work to Bangladesh and China, fewer retailers can use those three short words on popular clothing. There is one who thought of going the China route, then turned back to Made in the USA: Bayard Winthrop, founder of American Giant. American Giant sweatshirts are the darlings of Silicon Valley techies. After Farhad Manjoo, then a writer for Slate, wrote a piece heralding Winthrop\u2019s sweatshirt as the \u201cgreatest hoodie ever made\u201d, the company sold out of its entire stock within 36 hours. After a few months, the company increased its production capacity 15 to 20 times what it was previously and the greatest hoodie ever made was back in stock. It\u2019s a fallacy, Winthrop says, that in order to purchase an American-made product consumers either have to sacrifice quality or put up with high prices. When he considered factories in China, \u201cI realized I was chasing the cheapest material, the cheapest labor,\u201d he explains to the Guardian. With main offices in San Francisco and staff of about 23, Winthrop works with five US-based factories to make basic wear like sweatshirts, shirts and now even sweatpants. Two of the factories are based in California, three in North Carolina. \u201cPeople want to buy American made products,\u201d says Winthrop. \u201cSweatshirts, particularly, are an iconic American wear and no brand had owned or done a particularly good job with it\u201d. North Carolina \u201cis still a million times easier than Shenzen,\u201d he has told reporters. This stance is surprising in our era of gleeful corporate outsourcing, but perhaps not a shock coming from Winthrop himself, who is descended from several American giants himself. Although he never mentions it, Winthrop\u2019s family counts itself among the original Puritan English migrants who established the city of Boston. His forebears helped found the Massachusetts Bay Colony, starting with John Winthrop, who was described as a \u201cFreedom Man\u201d by Ronald Reagan; subsequent Winthrops were civil war generals and prominent bankers. Even though he did not grow up with that side of the family, American patriotism might reasonably be expected of him. Despite this when Winthrop launched his company in early 2012, he wasn\u2019t answering one of the many calls from Barack Obama to create more American-made products. He had a \u201cone of those learning moments, just out of the blue,\u201d that creating sweatshirts in foreign factories would undermine the company\u2019s \u201cbrand values and quality.\u201d \u201cConsumers were learning about brands in a fundamentally new way. They were telling friends about it. They were communicating via social word of mouth. Print ads were being replaced,\u201d he explains. \u201cPeople were pulled in not by huge full-page ads, but by word-of-mouth. Consumers were saying that they are increasingly trusting their peers to tell them about what\u2019s happening out there.\u201d We caught up with Winthrop to talk about running a Made in America company and all that that entails. Did you ever imagine that you would be running and managing a clothing company? I grew up in a family that had a pretty well-off father and a mother that was not well-off. My parents divorced when I was young and my dad paid for my education, but not much else. I had a pretty gold-plated New England-education but at home, it was different. I think I was aware of that at the time \u2013 but looking back at that, it gave me a certain amount of drive and passion about wanting to prove myself financially. Right out of college, I ended up going into corporate-finance, investment banking and Wall Street stuff, but I pretty quickly, in that process, met business leaders and found myself getting energized and inspired by the businesses that we were watching. At that point, I knew that I wanted to be running a business. I was very interested in making things and so I knew I wanted to be in manufacturing business. One thing I will say, I grew up in the 70s and my mom on her budget was able to buy me a US-made sweatshirt that was of the best quality in the world, that she could afford. It would last forever. And 40 years later, when you got an iPhone in your pocket that can play every song, do a conference call, order you a car, buy you groceries, we no longer as a nation have the ability to make that sweatshirt in the US. I always had a bit of chip on my shoulder about that. There is so much pressure on manufacturers, cost cutting, on US laborers, but no one has stepped back and taken a critical look at where all of the \u201cspend\u201d is. I was always sort of annoyed and aware of that, but I don\u2019t think I ever said that I am going to one day make a \u2018Made in America\u2019 a viable business model. Would you say that having a background in corporate finance helped with starting your own business? I think it helps tremendously. It builds understanding of how important financials are, but also that was a particularly vigorous and demanding job to have right out of college. It taught me quickly to work hard, to work accurately, to know what you are talking about. Is it easy to communicate your values to your staff? Does your culture support that? An interesting thing happens organizationally when you simplify an organization. A company like Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, for example, which has huge marketing disciplines, huge real estate disciplines, huge supply chain disciplines, one of the hallmark of these commerce business is that they can have much linear organization with people focusing on a narrower set of things that are critical to the businesses and making the business really go. The staff working at American Giant is intimately involved with really either product or customers. The way that we communicate with our people, we really empower folks. We basically have an internal pride in the organization as a whole. There is maximum value to our customers, strip away everything else. The empowering and the ability to make these decisions gets pushed down in the organization. My customer service team is completely empowered to override a replacement sweatshirt if the customer gets the sweatshirt in the wrong color. Or they send a gift certificate as a thank you for supporting us. There is an awful lot of employee empowerment that allows the people at American Giant to be directly responsible for how we do as a company. There\u2019s lot of real sense of pride, ownership and clarity in what we do. You had your mini-Oprah moment when Farhad [Manjoo] wrote a piece about your sweatshirt, calling it the greatest hoodie ever made and you saw an significant increase in demand for your product. You sold out in 36 hours. What did you learn from that experience? It was in December of 2012 ... What the piece did, it definitely got us a lot of awareness around the business. But most importantly than that, it pushed us along to consumers and media about our business model and the product. It had an impact of growing the business significantly. But also, the impact of having the media sort of say \u2018Gee, American manufacturing is something that is viable now, it could be a new commerce model.\u2019 We had to go and make something in the United States and sell it at the same retail price as Abercrombie &amp; Fitch sweatshirt for a much better quality. \u2018Is that even possible?\u2019 You had people asking if the product is as good as he says it is. I think he wrote that one line: I didn\u2019t just write about American Giant. I turned down the lights, put on some Barry White, and, over the course of around 2,000 gyrating words, unspooled my sweet, tender love for the company and its clothes. I was debating quoting that exact line at you \u2026 That comment, it had a lot of consumers saying: \u2018Is this that good?\u2019 It kicked off a lot of interesting discussions. For me, it did two things: from a volume standpoint, it made us say: how can you predict demand in an unpredictable, vast and scary environment? The other thing it did for us: it made really clear to us that if you stick to your principles to build a great product, you stand for something - in our case that meant make it in United States and keep retail prices reasonable so that you can reach mainstream consumer - and you can get very big. The inverse of that was: don\u2019t get distracted. Focus on what you do well. Keep doing it. Keep true to your customers, and if you do that they will take care of you and they will spread the word and have people like Farhad say great things. What\u2019s next for American Giant?

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Labour has a twin deficit problem. Ed Miliband is seen as less fit to be prime minister than David Cameron. And the Conservatives are a long way ahead on economic competence. Parties sometimes win with unpopular leaders. Jim Callaghan was better liked than Margaret Thatcher in 1979. They can also win when they are behind on the economy, as Tony Blair was in 1997. But there is no recent precedent for victory when voters like neither a party's leader nor its economic policies. Labour has eight months to deal with its twin deficit problem, starting this week. Things are not quite as grim as they might seem, since the Conservatives have a few problems of their own. Parties in power for more than one term tend to get less popular over time: no re-elected government since 1955 has increased its share of the vote [see footnote]. And governments that preside over periods of falling living standards \u2013 as this one has \u2013 tend to get turfed out. So, with all to play for in the election, Labour's economic strategy has three elements. Firstly, the shadow chancellor, Ed Balls, has sought to rebuild the party's reputation for economic competence by agreeing to stick to George Osborne's spending plans during his first year at the Treasury and to reduce the national debt as a share of the UK's annual output during the course of the next parliament. Balls has said Labour would be prepared to borrow for investment in areas such as public transport and house building. Secondly, Labour has a series of tax and spending measures designed to show it has a different set of priorities to the Conservatives. Miliband announced on Sunday a plan to raise the minimum wage to \u00a38 an hour during the next parliament. There are also proposals for a bank bonus tax to fund a compulsory job guarantee for young people and for a mansion tax on homes worth more than \u00a32m to pay for a new 10% starting rate of income tax. Finally, what Miliband calls his \"One Nation\" approach is part of a broader critique of an economy in which the link that long existed between growth and rising living standards for all has been severed. Hence the commitments to freeze domestic energy bills and to break up the banks if there is an insufficiently strong ringfence separating the high street from the investment operations of the big banks. The Labour leader believes the strong showing for the yes side in the Scottish referendum was about economics as much as politics. \"The overwhelming mood in this referendum was not actually different from the mood in the rest of the United Kingdom and this is why Cameron has got it so wrong,\" he said in an interview with the Observer. \"It is about the way we are governed, yes, but as much if not more it is about change in the way our economy works.\" The likelihood is that earnings will not start to rise more rapidly than prices this side of the election. That means living standards will continue to be squeezed, and that is a big plus for the two Eds. They should also be able to exploit any signs of a slowdown in the pace of growth over the coming quarters. Even so, Labour's strategy has its problems. Balls did well in his first two years as shadow chancellor by saying repeatedly and correctly that Osborne's austerity plan would arrest economic recovery and make deficit reduction harder. But by accepting the need for austerity \u2013 even if it is austerity lite \u2013 he has undercut his own argument. Labour thinks it can have the best of all worlds through a mixture of tough spending commitments coupled with a bit more wriggle room for capital spending. It may instead get the worst of all worlds: viewed as not being tough enough on the deficit and not deemed credible to deliver on its promises. Indeed, a cynical electorate may decide that the only bit of Labour's plan they believe is the commitment for more austerity. A second problem is that only four years have elapsed since Labour was last in power. Voters may share Miliband's view that the economy is not delivering the pay rises, the house-building programmes or the public services they would like but not trust the opposition to deliver them. House building plummeted during Labour's 13 years in power. The squeeze on living standards started before the 2010 election. The failures of City regulation happened on Labour's watch. This legacy from the recent past has meant Labour's economic strategy is a mixture of the bold and the timid. It has a fundamental critique of the failings of modern global capitalism but only rather modest proposals for dealing with them. This is a point made in A Convenient Truth, a pamphlet for the Fabian Society by Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett (who anatomised the dangers of inequality in their book The Spirit Level). Calling for legislation that would put workers on the boards of all but the smallest companies, the pair note: \"What matters most for reducing inequality is the strength of progressive politics as a countervailing voice in society. Some time after the late 1970s the political left lost its conviction that a better form of society was possible and left the way open for neo-liberalism.\" It's worth remembering, though, that many of the individual policies associated with the catch-all term neo-liberalism were quite popular with large numbers of voters. They liked the abolition of exchange controls because it meant they could take more money out of the country when going on holiday. They liked financial deregulation because it meant they didn't have to queue for a mortgage. They liked the cheap imports that resulted from globalisation. The sort of change desired by Wilkinson and Pickett requires a number of things to happen. There needs to be a crisis of the prevailing order. That has happened. There need to be policies to even up the contest between capital and labour, including writing trade unions back into the script. There needs to be a willingness to take on the rich and the powerful. But there also has to be a sense of what is sellable to voters, who are a lot more sceptical of government than they were in the post-war golden age. The reason for Labour's loss of conviction was not that it loved Thatcherism but that it kept losing elections. It shifted to a more pro-market stance because that's where it perceived the political centre of gravity to be. Unfortunately, the lack of a more profound analysis of light-touch deregulation and the kowtowing to the City proved costly when the banks almost brought down the global economy in 2008. Labour, like other centre-left parties, had no alternative to put forward. It will take time \u2013 and courage \u2013 to make good that omission. \u2022 This footnote was added on 24 September 2014. No government that has served most of a full term has been re-elected with an increased share of the vote since 1955, although the Labour government's vote increased in 1966 and October 1974.",

There are also proposals for a bank bonus tax to fund a compulsory job guarantee for young people and for a mansion tax on homes worth more than \u00a32m to pay for a new 10% starting rate of income tax.</p> <p>Finally, what Miliband calls his \"One Nation\" approach is part of a broader critique of an economy in which the link that long existed between growth and rising living standards for all has been severed. Hence the commitments to freeze domestic energy bills and to break up the banks if there is an insufficiently strong ringfence separating the high street from the investment operations of the big banks.</p> <p>The Labour leader believes the strong showing for the yes side in the Scottish referendum was about economics as much as politics. \"The overwhelming mood in this referendum was not actually different from the mood in the rest of the United Kingdom and this is why Cameron has got it so wrong,\" he said in an interview with the Observer. \"It is about the way we are governed, yes, but as much if not more it is about change in the way our economy works.\"</p> <p>The likelihood is that earnings will not start to rise more rapidly than prices this side of the election. That means living standards will continue to be squeezed, and that is a big plus for the two Eds. They should also be able to exploit any signs of a slowdown in the pace of growth over the coming quarters.</p> <p>Even so, Labour's strategy has its problems. Balls did well in his first two years as shadow chancellor by saying repeatedly and correctly that Osborne's austerity plan would arrest economic recovery and make deficit reduction harder. But by accepting the need for austerity \u2013 even if it is austerity lite \u2013 he has undercut his own argument. Labour thinks it can have the best of all worlds through a mixture of tough spending commitments coupled with a bit more wriggle room for capital spending. It may instead get the worst of all worlds: viewed as not being tough enough on the deficit and not deemed credible to deliver on its promises.</p> <p>Indeed, a cynical electorate may decide that the only bit of Labour's plan they believe is the commitment for more austerity. A second problem is that only four years have elapsed since Labour was last in power. Voters may share Miliband's view that the economy is not delivering the pay rises, the house-building programmes or the public services they would like but not trust the opposition to deliver them. House building plummeted during Labour's 13 years in power. The squeeze on living standards started before the 2010 election. The failures of City regulation happened on Labour's watch.</p> <p>This legacy from the recent past has meant Labour's economic strategy is a mixture of the bold and the timid. It has a fundamental critique of the failings of modern global capitalism but only rather modest proposals for dealing with them. This is a point made in A Convenient Truth, a pamphlet for the Fabian Society by Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett (who anatomised the dangers of inequality in their book The Spirit Level). Calling for legislation that would put workers on the boards of all but the smallest companies, the pair note: \"What matters most for reducing inequality is the strength of progressive politics as a countervailing voice in society. Some time after the late 1970s the political left lost its conviction that a better form of society was possible and left the way open for neo-liberalism.\"</p> <p>It's worth remembering, though, that many of the individual policies associated with the catch-all term neo-liberalism were quite popular with large numbers of voters. They liked the abolition of exchange controls because it meant they could take more money out of the country when going on holiday. They liked financial deregulation because it meant they didn't have to queue for a mortgage. They liked the cheap imports that resulted from globalisation.</p> <p>The sort of change desired by Wilkinson and Pickett requires a number of things to happen. There needs to be a crisis of the prevailing order. That has happened.</p> <p>There need to be policies to even up the contest between capital and labour, including writing trade unions back into the script. There needs to be a willingness to take on the rich and the powerful. But there also has to be a sense of what is sellable to voters, who are a lot more sceptical of government than they were in the post-war golden age.</p> <p>The reason for Labour's loss of conviction was not that it loved Thatcherism but that it kept losing elections. It shifted to a more pro-market stance because that's where it perceived the political centre of gravity to be. Unfortunately, the lack of a more profound analysis of light-touch deregulation and the kowtowing to the City proved costly when the banks almost brought down the global economy in 2008. Labour, like other centre-left parties, had no alternative to put forward. It will take time \u2013 and courage \u2013 to make good that omission.</p> <p>\u2022 This footnote was added on 24 September 2014. No government that has served most of a full term has been re-elected with an increased share of the vote since 1955, although the Labour government's vote increased in 1966 and October 1974.</p>",
