      "bodyText": "The troubled retailer House of Fraser is to shut three stores and is considering the closure of a fourth after its new owner, Sports Direct tycoon Mike Ashley, failed to agree terms with their landlords. Ashley, the owner of Newcastle United Football Club, recently bought the department store chain out of administration for \u00a390m. Following negotiations with landlords around Britain, 20 House of Frasers have so far been saved from closure, safeguarding around 3,500 jobs. However, Ashley told the Press Association he had been unable to save outlets in Edinburgh, Hull and Swindon after failing to agree terms. Hundreds of staff employed at the three stores will now go through redundancy consultation. A fourth House of Fraser, in Bath, is also at risk of closure as Ashley negotiates with the city council, the store\u2019s landlord, over new rental terms. It is understood that the landlords were reluctant to agree to the low \u2013 or in some cases zero \u2013 rents that Ashley was demanding. \u201cI am disappointed that in my opinion a small number of greedy landlords still refuse to be reasonable,\u201d he said. Ashley, who has pledged to save around 47 of House of Fraser\u2019s 59 outlets since buying the chain, recently struck a deal to save its flagship Oxford Street store. Others that have been saved from closure include stores in Altrincham, Aylesbury, Camberley, Carlisle, Darlington, Doncaster, Grimsby, High Wycombe, Lincoln, Middlesbrough, Plymouth, Skipton, Telford, Huddersfield, Leeds, Maidstone, Solihull and Sutton Coldfield. \u201cWe\u2019ve shown what we can achieve on the British high street when we work together with landlords,\u201d said Ashley. \u201cI would like to thank those landlords who have helped us to rescue approximately 3,500 jobs at the stores we have saved to date.\u201d Another store to be rescued is in Birkenhead, the constituency of veteran MP Frank Field, who described the news as \u201ctremendous\u201d. \u201cThis cornerstone of our town centre is being given a chance to flourish once again,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "This week the prime minister, Scott Morrison, was very much engaged in an exercise of answering the two questions most people are wondering about him: who are you and why are you here? When you find yourself the leader of a nation, it is generally good to have a reason for being there other than Morrison\u2019s current explanation that he basically tripped into the job by accident. Thus this week, in response to the needles in strawberry scare, out he strode in full \u201clook at me being a leader\u201d mode to announce tougher penalties and new laws. None of this was particularly needed. No one was sitting around thinking, \u201cgosh it is a pity that it is not a crime to put needles in strawberries\u201d. Neither was anyone really thinking: \u201cOh, there is a crime and it is punishable by 10 years in jail? Hmmm, sounds a bit weak, better make it 15 years to really deter.\u201d It was a pretty standard \u201ctough-on-crime\u201d response that we often see from conservative governments \u2013 not a great deal of thought was going into the impact or need for the laws, but it looked tough, it looked like something was being done, and it looked like the type of thing that conservative governments think leaders are supposed to look like they are doing. At any rate it got them into the news cycle, which was really the only purpose. Over the next six months, Morrison\u2019s campaign to explain who he is and to hope people forget to wonder why he is there looks set to be a mixture of the usual things that leaders who have dumped a prime minister do. We\u2019ll get the \u201coh gosh, I\u2019m just one of the regular folks, here\u2019s an anecdote about the time Donald Trump didn\u2019t understand me\u201d moments, and we\u2019ll get a lot of killing off of political headaches. Just as Julia Gillard in 2010 sought to end the issue of the mining tax by doing a deal with the mining companies, so too has Morrison sought to end any problems with the Catholic and independent school sectors by throwing a lazy $4.6bn at them over the next decade. It has not been met with great raptures from anyone except those who are about to receive the money. The NSW education minister, Rob Stokes, responded by arguing that \u201cwe don\u2019t want a return to the school funding wars of the past that pitted private schools against public schools, and urge the federal government to provide equal treatment for all schools, public and private\u201d. It was the type of issue that would have been well debated at the Coag meeting in October, especially as education was an issue the meeting was slated to discuss. But the prime minister this week announced he was cancelling the meeting because he didn\u2019t think it was needed and that \u201cthe only thing that happens as a result of not having that Coag meeting is less Tim Tams will be consumed in Canberra that week\u201d. I guess that is better than admitting his government has no idea what its policies are on the issues of health and education. It was a very Trumpian response from a man who seems to be neck deep in the US style of Republican party politics \u2013 including playing the culture war over religious \u201cfreedoms\u201d (ie allowing religious groups to discriminate). Oddly, however, the government wants to fight that war only once the Wentworth byelection has been run, as it is refusing to table the report of the \u201creligious freedom expert panel\u201d, despite having had it since May. At least it is making no bones about its position on climate change. This week the new energy minister, Angus Taylor, told parliament, \u201cthe renewable energy target is going to wind down from 2020 ... and we will not be replacing that with anything\u201d. Of course, why would any government want to have a policy other than to do nothing? But don\u2019t be fooled that the next election will see the government seeking only to go small target with a focus on culture wars and asylum seekers. The shift of Kelly O\u2019Dwyer to minister for jobs and industrial relations signals that the Liberal party, unconcerned that on an average afternoon the royal commission into the financial sector reveals more systemic abuse than did the entire royal commission into trade unions, looks eager to make industrial relations a key issue. Of course, given we\u2019re talking about the Liberal party, industrial relations really just means an anti-union policy. This was evident from O\u2019Dwyer\u2019s speech this week to the \u201cAustralian chamber business leaders\u2019 summit\u201d which rolled out the usual furphies about bipartisanship reforms during the Hawke and Keating years, and suggested that \u201ca law-breaking culture infects\u201d the building and construction industry. But this is an area where the Labor party is certainly up for a fight. This is not only because the era of deregulated labour markets has culminated in a period of stagnant real household incomes, but also the changing nature of the labour market has many worried about the future. This week the Senate committee on the future of work and workers released its report. The issue of the future of work is one fostered not just by the advent of new technologies and the use of apps to foster a \u201cgig economy\u201d, but because, as the committee noted, \u201cfor the first time in history, the wealth accumulation trajectory of the generation of workers entering employment is well below that of their predecessors at comparable ages\u201d. The committee found \u201cthat workers whose jobs are at high risk of automation are already more vulnerable, as they are often on lower incomes\u201d. But importantly it noted the submission by the Australia Institute\u2019s Dr James Stanford, who argued that Australia\u2019s industrial relations laws have so restricted the parameters around collective bargaining, that \u201cit isn\u2019t always clear that it\u2019s even a permitted matter to discuss technological change in the course of enterprise bargaining\u201d. The committee, dominated by the ALP and the Greens, thus recommended some fairly interventionist steps \u2013 including establishing a central body within the government to coordinate planning for the future of work and for a review of \u201cthe definition of casual work in light of the large numbers of Australians who are currently in non-standard employment\u201d. Casual work has been an area of particular debate recently. The dissenting Liberal senators noted that \u201cthe share of casual work has been relatively stable since the 1990s\u201d. And while that is true, mostly it is due to an increase in the number of women entering full-time work. The proportion of men doing casual work has risen since the turn of the century from 19% to 23%. Moreover, the percentage of full-time workers who are casuals has increased solidly in the past five years and the proportion of those under 24 working as casuals is at record levels. The committee also recommended that the definition of \u201cemployee\u201d be broadened to include gig workers and \u201censure that they have full access to protection under Australia\u2019s industrial relations system\u201d, and that labour-hire workers be required to \u201chave access to and be paid at least the same wages and conditions as the directly engaged employees working alongside them\u201d. These are moves that were very much disagreed with by the Liberal party members of the committee and highlights that both sides are squaring up to present very different positions come the election. And it is why amid all the bulldust of culture wars and attempts by the prime minister to look like a prime minister, policies \u2013 as ever \u2013 will be the real issue of the next election. \u2022 Greg Jericho is a Guardian Australia columnist",

      "bodyText": "Rupert Murdoch\u2019s control of Sky is likely to end after three decades after his 21st Century Fox company was outbid by US rival Comcast, which offered \u00a330bn to take full control of the British-based broadcaster in a high-stakes auction. The announcement on Saturday that Comcast has emerged on top was made after both companies submitted blind bids in a highly unusual process overseen by the Takeover Panel following a two-year bidding process. Comcast bid at \u00a317.28 per share, substantially more than Fox\u2019s \u00a315.67 offer. The bid has already been greenlit by Sky\u2019s independent directors and shareholders now have until 11 October to decide whether to accept the recommended offer. Murdoch has craved full control of Sky for years and his Fox company already owns 39% of the company. But Murdoch has agreed to sell most of his TV and film assets to Disney in a separate takeover deal, meaning even if he had been victorious he would not have been in total control for long. The auction of Sky involved a certain amount of game theory on both sides. Fox\u2019s decision to take part in the secretive process may have forced Comcast to table a knockout bid to ensure victory \u2013 meaning Fox will in turn receive an increased sum for the 39% stake it already owns. There is also an element of revenge after Comcast was beaten by Disney earlier this year in the battle for Fox\u2019s US entertainment business. The takeover process began in December 2016 when Fox tabled a bid to take full control of the London-based satellite broadcaster in a deal valuing the business at \u00a318bn. The proposal then cleared a number of regulatory hurdles in the face of legal challenges and strong parliamentary opposition from Labour politicians including Ed Miliband and the current deputy leader, Tom Watson. In February, Comcast unexpectedly gatecrashed the deal, forcing Murdoch to engage in a costly bidding war that peaked with Comcast\u2019s \u00a326bn bid. Because neither bidder declared their offer to be final, all parties agreed to take part in an auction process to decide the ultimate winner \u2013 the first time that such a process has been used in a decade and a rarity for such a large company. Jeremy Darroch, Sky\u2019s group chief executive, said: \u201cAs part of a broader Comcast we believe we will be able to continue to grow and strengthen our position as Europe\u2019s leading direct to consumer media company. \u201cToday\u2019s outcome is down to the hard work of tens of thousands of people who have built and developed this business together over the last 30 years. Sky has never stood still, and with Comcast our momentum will only increase.\u201d The auction marks a dramatic end for Sky as an independent company. The broadcaster began life in 1989 when Murdoch launched a standalone business offering four channels from an industrial estate in west London. The company was making enormous losses and soon merged with rival British Satellite Broadcasting to form BSkyB. Under Murdoch\u2019s leadership the combined business hit on a winning formula of selling subscriptions on the basis of film and football rights, helping to transform the British media industry and become a highly profitable business. Sky currently serves 26 million customers across Europe and its direct relationship with them is prized in an age when traditional media businesses are concerned about the threat posed by new streaming businesses. Sky has already struck a deal with Netflix to put the service on its set-top boxes and is also celebrating after cutting the amount it pays for Premier League rights.",

      "bodyText": "Europe\u2019s largest port, Rotterdam, is counting down to Brexit. \u201cIn about 200 days\u2019 time, if nothing else happens\u2026 we will need to supervise all the goods coming in and out of the UK market,\u201d says Roel van \u2019t Veld, Brexit coordinator at the Dutch customs authority. Hard Brexit or soft? Chequers dead or alive? Does \u201cmax-fac\u201d make any sense? The feverish debate in Westminster is distant for officials in Rotterdam, who are working on the assumption the UK will leave the EU\u2019s single market and customs union on 29 March 2019. At the stroke of midnight, the UK will become another country to its EU neighbours. Rotterdam will have to run checks on 10,500 newly \u201cforeign\u201d boats. Officials expect a 30% increase in import inspections and a 100% increase in export inspections. Ferry operators warn of form-filling and delays. While a transition period could delay those changes until 2021, nothing is being taken for granted. Companies are \u201cspoiled\u201d by the ease of trading within the EU\u2019s internal market, van \u2019t Veld says. Take a Dutch company that makes ready meals for British consumers. Today it needs only a contract with a shop. In future, companies on both sides of the North Sea would need production location registration, an export declaration, exit and entry declarations and more. \u201cInstead of two pieces of documentation you would need nine additional documents,\u201d says van \u2019t Veld, based on his reading of the UK customs bill. \u201cIn 200 days\u2019 time, you cannot just send a ship, and if you don\u2019t anticipate those changes, ships will not get through the gates.\u201d (Since he spoke this month, more days have slipped by.) The Netherlands will be one of the EU countries hardest hit by Brexit. Even under the \u201cbest-case\u201d scenario of an EU free-trade agreement with the UK, it would lose 0.9% of annual economic output, worth \u20ac450 (\u00a3400) per person by 2030, according to the Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis. And when Brexit hurts, Rotterdam will feel the first pinch. Spread over a 25-mile-long area, the city supports 180,000 jobs and 3.5% of Dutch economic output. To prepare for Brexit, 928 extra customs officials and 145 veterinary inspectors are being hired, following a recommendation from the Dutch parliament. Pieter Omtzigt, a Christian Democrat MP, who co-drafted the parliament\u2019s report on Brexit, describes his message to the government: \u201cBe prepared. Because Great Britain is running so late that you may run into trouble because there hasn\u2019t been time to prepare things. This is a way too serious scenario.\u201d He would prefer Dutch public money were spent on 1,000 new teachers or nurses, he tells the Observer, but feels his country has no choice. \u201cIf, like the Netherlands, you earn more than half your money with trade, you understand that if the UK leaves the customs union, the work for customs and excise increases significantly. The Netherlands simply cannot afford a disrupted customs system.\u201d Preparations are advancing. In November, Rotterdam will start test runs on new IT systems. Port authorities worry about the 35,000 small and medium-sized Dutch companies that trade with the UK and have never dealt with the paperwork that comes with buying and selling outside the EU. \u201cIf the companies are not well prepared, then we will be in deep trouble,\u201d says Mark Dijk, manager of external relations at the port of Rotterdam. The preparations underscore how unusual Brexit is: a move to put up barriers, rather than bring them down. Rotterdam\u2019s \u201cshort-sea\u201d shipping port used to have customs offices for checking goods coming from the UK. But they were dismantled after the launch of the single market in 1993. The space has gone. No one ever thought it would be needed again. Hemmed in by railway tracks and motorway, Rotterdam has no room to expand its short-sea ports. Nor can it afford to slow down, says Marcel van der Vlugt, operations manager at the ferry company Stena Line. \u201cOur business is running 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, so there is no space to slow down. There is only space to speed up the process.\u201d Brexit is not as simple as winding the clock back. The number of lorries passing through Rotterdam has more than quintupled since 1989, while \u201cjust-in-time\u201d supply chains are far more intricate. \u201cThe situation has changed since 1993,\u201d says van der Vlugt. He was speaking on board the Stena Transporter, hours before it began its overnight voyage to Killingholme on the Lincolnshire coast, laden with fruit, vegetables and industrial goods. Finely tuned just-in-time systems mean a British supermarket can order a crate of Dutch cucumbers at 8am and have them on the shelves before teatime. Many of the UK-bound lorries at Rotterdam are checked on to the ferry in 90 seconds. Stena Line, which runs four or five ships a day to British ports, is worried about delays to cargoes of fresh produce. \u201cThat there will be congestion, no doubt \u2013 to what extent, difficult to say,\u201d says Annika Hult, the company\u2019s trade director. For some British politicians, fears over delay and bureaucracy are exactly why the EU should grant the UK an unprecedentedly generous post-Brexit trade deal. But this argument \u2013 a variation on the German carmaker thesis promoted by Brexit supporters such as Boris Johnson \u2013 has not found favour with the Dutch government. In The Hague, unravelling the EU single market is seen as a bigger risk to the Dutch economy than Brexit disruption. Rem Korteweg at the Netherlands Institute of International Relations does not see the Dutch government breaking ranks with the EU, not least because the Dutch have \u201cmassive concerns\u201d about the economic playing field being tilted in favour of the British. \u201cIf there is an element of de-regulation in the UK, it could really introduce a competitive disadvantage that would harm the Dutch.\u201d The UK has a choice, believes Omtzigt. \u201cIf you do not have a customs union and a common market then you have checks on the borders,\u201d the Dutch politician says. \u201cI would very much like the UK to stay within the common market, but it appears that the UK prefers not to.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The long, slow and premature death of the Post Office has been agonising to observe. Never has \u201cdeath by a thousand cuts\u201d been more apposite than the deliberate destruction of a once-proud service into the shabby shell of a business it is now. The litter-strewn floor of my scruffy and dimly-lit local branch is now squashed behind a Lebara phone merchant. As you join the long queue amid the discarded Coke cans and lottery scratchcards, you have time to scrutinise what is being advertised in the Post Office. The \u00a3100 payday loan advert from \u201cRhodes Finance\u201d has outlasted the lender itself, which appears to be defunct. Nearby, a machine begs me to \u201cbuy and sell crypto instantly\u201d. I\u2019d have more confidence in the spiritualist who, I\u2019m told, also used to advertise there. After trying to make sense speaking through screens (where staff wearily try to up-sell something or other), you\u2019re expected to deposit your parcel in an open-access window that almost invites thieves to walk off with your returned Amazon box. How different from the town-centre post office of my childhood, a grand and elegant high-ceilinged affair which sold not just stamps but represented the connection between the state and the citizen. It was where I sorted out my first passport and my first driving licence, where my dad paid his TV licence and my grandad picked up his pension. Yes, of course we\u2019re not sending letters like we used to. But need the business have sunk as low as it has? Unlike my bank branch, which I very rarely visit, there are still plenty of reasons to go to a post office. It can be the only explanation for the long queues. My elderly parents still cash their pension at one of the \u201cagency\u201d offices carved out of a tawdry convenience store, but feel more insecure on every visit. In what the Post Office calls \u201ccontinuing modernisation\u201d it continues to close standalone branches. Half of all post offices have shut since the early 1980s, although the pace of closures has now declined. One of the latest to go is the Walthamstow branch in east London. It will shift to a \u201cdesignated area\u201d at the rear of an ageing mini-market which appears almost designed to deter you going there. It\u2019s not just Britain that is struggling with what to do with the post office network. In Ireland, An Post last week pressed self-destruct on 159 rural post offices that will be the death-knell for scores of remoter communities. But there is something very old fashioned that could yet save post offices. They\u2019re called notes and coins. A senior banker this week told me of how the bank branch closure programme evolved: when the banks were told that there had to be at least one branch left in every sizeable location, it actually accelerated closures, as each bank raced to avoid being the last one left. A similar process is at work with cash machines: banks are desperately shutting theirs (300 are closing every month) as cash usage collapses, and because they don\u2019t want the bill for managing the last one left. His solution: the post office. It can be the core location for banking services in villages and towns vacated by the banks, and provide a guaranteed way for people to obtain cash wherever they are. But before we get there, can the Post Office find a way of making its stores and branches places someone might actually want to visit? p.collinson@theguardian.com",

      "bodyText": "Jack\u2019s has won round one in the supermarket discounters price war according to a Guardian analysis \u2013 but Aldi is promising to fight back with cuts to match or beat the prices at the new chain launched by Tesco. In a price check on a basket of 18 popular items, Jack\u2019s was cheaper than rivals Lidl, Aldi and Tesco\u2019s main chain outlets. Jack\u2019s cornflakes, tea bags, pizza, milk and wine were either cheaper than rivals or price-matched. On most items, Jack\u2019s prices are identical to those at Aldi, rather than Lidl. The chain has chosen to set prices locally to match or beat the closest geographic rival. The first Jack\u2019s store in Chatteris, Cambridgeshire, is a two-minute drive from an Aldi. Aldi\u2019s cheapest loaf of bread is 49p \u2013 and so is Jack\u2019s. An iceberg lettuce at either store is 48p, while bananas are 13p each. The cheapest tea bags at both stores are 85p for a box of 80, while yoghurts work out at 11p per pot at each. Both have toilet paper at 23p a roll and baked beans at 23p a tin. Lidl used cheap wine prices to entice bargain-hungry shoppers, and Jack\u2019s is following a similar strategy. Its house white, \u201ca lively dry white wine with refreshing flavours of apples and citrus fruits\u201d is just \u00a33.15 a bottle. That matches the lowest price for wine (of above 10% alcohol content) at Lidl, and is significantly cheaper than Aldi\u2019s \u00a33.69. It\u2019s worth noting that the duty on a standard 75cl bottle of wine in England and Wales is \u00a32.16, with VAT added on top. Then there is the cost of the glass bottle itself and transportation. So shoppers buying full-strength wine at \u00a33.15 a bottle are paying only 30p or 40p for the wine, possibly even less. Jack\u2019s has also opened a new front in the milk price war, which has forced many dairy famers out of business amid claims they are being forced to sell at below cost price. Jack\u2019s is selling semi-skimmed at 43.5p a litre, compared with 44p a litre in Aldi and mainstream Tesco supermarkets. Aldi vowed to fight back, promising to undertake a full price review and adjust prices if necessary. Aldi said: \u201cWe welcome choice and competition in the fastest growing area of the grocery market. Our customers will always pay the lowest grocery prices in the UK every time they shop with us.\u201d",
