      "bodyText": "David Cameron and Ed Miliband were locked in a trial of strength on Tuesday night over the status and breadth of an inquiry into British banking, amid signs that a political deadlock between the two parties could yet lead to no inquiry being set up at all. In the Lords, the government defeated a Labour attempt to set up a judicial inquiry into banking by 251 to 197. But in an attempt to force the issue further, Cameron announced that MPs will be asked to vote on Thursday on either setting up a judicial inquiry, or a joint parliamentary inquiry of peers and MPs, as proposed by the government. Although the Tories, with Liberal Democrat support, are certain to win Thursday's vote, it is still possible that Labour could boycott the joint parliamentary inquiry. The Treasury select committee chairman Andrew Tyrie, chosen by the government to chair the joint committee inquiry, has said it cannot proceed without cross-party support. Cameron was being pressed to hold further private talks with Miliband about the composition, terms of reference, powers and resources to be given to the joint committee. The former head of the civil service Lord O'Donnell suggested the government press ahead with the parliamentary inquiry, but keep open the option of a further, fuller inquiry if it is needed. Labour claimed, despite government denials, that the terms of reference of the parliamentary inquiry are too narrowly trained on the issue of Libor price setting as opposed to the wider banking issues. Miliband said: \"If [Cameron] doesn't order that judge-led inquiry, he will be failing to understand both the gravity and scale of the crisis \u2026 We've got to seize the moment. The last thing the public want is a sense that the establishment is trying to cover it up and sweep it under the carpet.\" Labour also claimed that a politician-led inquiry was likely to descend into political point-scoring over whether the previous Labour government had presided over a system of light-touch regulation that had allowed the Libor scandal at Barclays to go ahead undetected. The prime minister's spokesman hinted at some flexibility over the terms of reference: \"Parliamentary committees can make judgments about the precise issues they look at.\" The chancellor, George Osborne, urged Labour \"to see sense\", arguing that a judge-led inquiry would take too long. He also said that, as Labour had been in power when the interest rate-fixing had gone on, its former ministers would be \"the most afraid\", adding: \"No one more than me would like to see [shadow chancellor] Ed Balls in the dock.\" In the upper house, Lord Sassoon, the Treasury minister, accused Labour of a misguided attempt to slow down an urgent need for an inquiry that on any construction had very wide terms of reference. Labour countered that a parliamentary inquiry required to report by the end of the year, as the government proposed, would in practice, due to summer holidays and party conferences, effectively have only two months to take evidence and reach conclusions. The deadlock was made more complex by a meeting of the Treasury select committee that saw both Tory and Labour MPs questioning why the committee was being sidelined. The committee is due to take evidence from the former Barclays chief executive Bob Diamond on Wednesday, and has plans to call other witnesses. It has already taken extensive evidence on financial regulation. Privately, some Tory sources admitted that Osborne's nakedly party political stance on Monday in the Commons had made it more difficult to create cross-party consensus.",

The high-profile and outspoken banker is expected to unleash a wave of explosive revelations about the role of City watchdogs and senior Whitehall figures in the manipulation of crucial interest rates that landed the bank with a record \u00a3290m fine last week. The chancellor, George Osborne, who had been putting the banker under intense pressure to quit, said his sudden resignation was \"the right decision for Barclays \u2013 and for the country\". \"I think Bob Diamond's resignation is the first step towards the new age of responsibility we need to see.\" After an extraordinary 24 hours during which the bank's chairman, Marcus Agius, quit only to be temporarily reinstated once Diamond had departed, the role of Bank of England officials in the rate-rigging scandal is likely to take centre stage in the hearing with MPs.

In a statement, Diamond said: \"I am deeply disappointed that the impression created by the events announced last week about what Barclays and its people stand for could not be further from the truth.\" At his appearance before the Treasury select committee of MPs \u2013 chaired by the Conservative MP Andrew Tyrie, who the government has also appointed to lead a parliamentary inquiry into banking \u2013 Diamond will try to explain the bank's actions for the period between 2005 and 2009, when the attempts to manipulate Libor took place. Barclays released an email written by Diamond recording a conversation with Paul Tucker, the deputy governor of the Bank of England, in October 2008, which will be scrutinised by the MPs. The sequence of events unleashed by the email in the darkest days of the banking crisis also forced the departure of Jerry del Missier, who was Diamond's closest colleague at the bank. Del Missier, a Canadian, was promoted to chief operating officer a fortnight ago, but was named as the top executive who instructed more junior staff to lower the bank's submissions to the key benchmark rate, the London interbank offered rate (Libor), at the centre of the current scandal. MPs will be keen not to let the controversy over the potential involvement of the Bank of England \u2013 and unnamed Whitehall officials \u2013 to detract from regulatory evidence that prior to the 2008 crisis, Barclays traders were attempting to manipulate Libor to help boost the bank's profits. Emails that read, \"This one's for you, big boy\" and references to bottles of Bollinger champagne are hard for the bank to explain.

    "webTitle": "Bob Diamond's resignation: the late exchanges that led to his demise", 
    "fields": {
      "standfirst": "Once the former Barclays chief executive realised he was the biggest problem facing the bank, it was time to go", 
      "body": "<p>On Monday afternoon Bob Diamond rehearsed for his planned appearance before the Commons Treasury select committee. As his public relations team ran him through question after question that the MPs were likely to fire at him, the American born banker saw that he \u2013 and his brash personality \u2013 was the main problem facing Barclays bank.</p> <p>Diamond, 16 years at the bank, but only 18 months into his dream job as chief executive, spoke to a few close colleagues before setting off for home, knowing that David Cameron had used the revelations about Barclays' attempts to manipulate the London interbank offered rate (Libor) to call an inquiry into the wider banking industry.</p> <p>Though regulators admit that Barclays is only one of up to 20 banks caught up in the scandal, Diamond epitomised it.</p> <p>Diamond rang Barclays chairman Marcus Agius and told him it was time for him to go. It was a stunning change in stance from the defiant email to staff he had sent a few hours earlier, telling them he \"loved Barclays\" and was committed to putting right the wrongs exposed by regulators.</p> <p>Behind the scenes bigger forces were at work. The regulators had watched the political temperature rising during the day and the Bank of England governor, Sir Mervyn King, and Lord Turner of the Financial Services Authority secretly met Agius, who had himself resigned only hours before, in the late afternoon.</p> <p>King would not comment but Turner said: \"There were major challenges for Barclays in making sure they could convince people there had been a fundamental cultural change and we simply communicated to the board that these were issues they needed to think about. It was for them to agree whether they could achieve that degree of change under the current leadership.\"</p> <p>Agius was hastily reinstated, into a bigger job looking after the company until a new chief executive is appointed. He refused to comment, but it is clear that the words exchanged between the three top men were key. Diamond's days were numbered.</p> <p>Damaging emails published by regulators had shown traders promising to fix Libor at certain levels \u2013 so the bank could make extra profit \u2013 with quips such as \"this one's for you big boy\" and references to bottles of Bollinger champagne proving impossible to justify. Then there was the confusion about whether, during the 2008 banking crisis, the bank had deliberately manipulated down the price of Libor in attempt to demonstrate to the outside world that it was not, in the words of one of the emails, \"in the shit\". Documents published ahead of the select committee hearing show Diamond's emailed note of his 29 October 2008 conversation with Paul Tucker, a deputy governor of the Bank of England. Addressed to the then-Barclays chief executive John Varley, and copied to Diamond's close lieutenant Jerry del Missier, it will be scrutinised by MPs. Del Missier used it as the basis to tell Barclays staff to reduce their Libor quotes. Del Missier, who was investigated by the FSA and cleared, also quit on Tuesday \u2013 a month after he was appointed the bank's chief operating officer. At the select committee Diamond is expected to say that he did not believe Tucker told him to cut Barclays' rates.</p> <p>During an emergency board meeting on Monday night the bank's non-executive directors had to take some quick decisions. The board had intended the departure of Agius to take the heat off Diamond before his appearance at the select committee and give the board some breathing space to ensure there was a possible successor lined up to replace Diamond once the dust had settled. The plan backfired spectacularly. Agius, in a hastily convened conference call, said: \"What I hoped to do was lower the temperature surrounding the bank but it became evident as Monday went on if anything the temperature rose.\"</p> <p>Within minutes of the announcement hitting the stock exchange on Monday, Labour leader Ed Miliband was on the sofa of ITV Daybreak calling for Diamond to go. Liberal Democrat peer Lord Oakeshott, never short of a scathing quote, particularly about Barclays, was quick to describe the departure of Agius as the equivalent of kicking out the passenger rather than the driver. \"The board is so hopeless they've just shot the head of the firing squad and missed the prisoner,\" Oakeshott said.</p> <p>The government, under pressure to launch a fully-blown Leveson-style inquiry, used it as a moment to set Andrew Tyrie, chairman of the Treasury committee, the extra task of chairing a joint committee of MPs and Lords to investigate the banking industry.</p> <p>When Diamond's resignation was announced at 7.30am on Tuesday \u2013 30 minutes after the usual time for such announcements, the hastiness of the decision was evident.

      "bodyText": "On Monday afternoon Bob Diamond rehearsed for his planned appearance before the Commons Treasury select committee. As his public relations team ran him through question after question that the MPs were likely to fire at him, the American born banker saw that he \u2013 and his brash personality \u2013 was the main problem facing Barclays bank. Diamond, 16 years at the bank, but only 18 months into his dream job as chief executive, spoke to a few close colleagues before setting off for home, knowing that David Cameron had used the revelations about Barclays' attempts to manipulate the London interbank offered rate (Libor) to call an inquiry into the wider banking industry. Though regulators admit that Barclays is only one of up to 20 banks caught up in the scandal, Diamond epitomised it. Diamond rang Barclays chairman Marcus Agius and told him it was time for him to go. It was a stunning change in stance from the defiant email to staff he had sent a few hours earlier, telling them he \"loved Barclays\" and was committed to putting right the wrongs exposed by regulators. Behind the scenes bigger forces were at work. The regulators had watched the political temperature rising during the day and the Bank of England governor, Sir Mervyn King, and Lord Turner of the Financial Services Authority secretly met Agius, who had himself resigned only hours before, in the late afternoon. King would not comment but Turner said: \"There were major challenges for Barclays in making sure they could convince people there had been a fundamental cultural change and we simply communicated to the board that these were issues they needed to think about. It was for them to agree whether they could achieve that degree of change under the current leadership.\" Agius was hastily reinstated, into a bigger job looking after the company until a new chief executive is appointed. He refused to comment, but it is clear that the words exchanged between the three top men were key. Diamond's days were numbered. Damaging emails published by regulators had shown traders promising to fix Libor at certain levels \u2013 so the bank could make extra profit \u2013 with quips such as \"this one's for you big boy\" and references to bottles of Bollinger champagne proving impossible to justify. Then there was the confusion about whether, during the 2008 banking crisis, the bank had deliberately manipulated down the price of Libor in attempt to demonstrate to the outside world that it was not, in the words of one of the emails, \"in the shit\". Documents published ahead of the select committee hearing show Diamond's emailed note of his 29 October 2008 conversation with Paul Tucker, a deputy governor of the Bank of England. Addressed to the then-Barclays chief executive John Varley, and copied to Diamond's close lieutenant Jerry del Missier, it will be scrutinised by MPs. Del Missier used it as the basis to tell Barclays staff to reduce their Libor quotes. Del Missier, who was investigated by the FSA and cleared, also quit on Tuesday \u2013 a month after he was appointed the bank's chief operating officer. At the select committee Diamond is expected to say that he did not believe Tucker told him to cut Barclays' rates. During an emergency board meeting on Monday night the bank's non-executive directors had to take some quick decisions. The board had intended the departure of Agius to take the heat off Diamond before his appearance at the select committee and give the board some breathing space to ensure there was a possible successor lined up to replace Diamond once the dust had settled. The plan backfired spectacularly. Agius, in a hastily convened conference call, said: \"What I hoped to do was lower the temperature surrounding the bank but it became evident as Monday went on if anything the temperature rose.\" Within minutes of the announcement hitting the stock exchange on Monday, Labour leader Ed Miliband was on the sofa of ITV Daybreak calling for Diamond to go. Liberal Democrat peer Lord Oakeshott, never short of a scathing quote, particularly about Barclays, was quick to describe the departure of Agius as the equivalent of kicking out the passenger rather than the driver. \"The board is so hopeless they've just shot the head of the firing squad and missed the prisoner,\" Oakeshott said. The government, under pressure to launch a fully-blown Leveson-style inquiry, used it as a moment to set Andrew Tyrie, chairman of the Treasury committee, the extra task of chairing a joint committee of MPs and Lords to investigate the banking industry. When Diamond's resignation was announced at 7.30am on Tuesday \u2013 30 minutes after the usual time for such announcements, the hastiness of the decision was evident. Agius had called the chancellor, George Osborne, in the early hours to tell him Diamond was going while he was taking over as full-time chairman to find a new chief executive. Osborne, in a Today programme interview shortly afterwards, said: \"I think and I hope that it is the first step towards a new culture of responsibility in British banking.\" In a statement Diamond praised \"an extraordinarily talented management team that I know is well placed to help the business emerge from this difficult period as one of the leaders in the global banking industry\". But the reality is that the business he joined in 1997, and transformed into a powerhouse in investment banking on the world stage, is poised to undergo as radical an upheaval as the one he led in the go-go years before the 2008 banking crisis. One of nine children, Robert E Diamond \u2013 known internally as RED \u2013 grew up in Concord, Massachusetts. His parents were teachers, a career path he had intended to follow by starting out as a lecturer in management and organisation at the University of Connecticut. After four years, in 1980, he ended up at Morgan Stanley, following a businessman who had mentored him, moving to Credit Suisse First Boston a decade later before arriving at Barclays in 1996. A sports fanatic \u2013 when he ran BarCap his glass cube office was full of sports memorabilia \u2013 he adopted Chelsea as his \"soccer\" team, becoming a regular visitor to their dressing room and presenter of trophies when the club won the premier league, sponsored by Barclays. He loves Boston Red Sox and American football team Patriots, and while his children \u2013 now adults \u2013 were young ran the little league football in Hyde Park, London. A keen skier and regular golfer and tennis player, he put his drive and energy into building BarCap into a major league player. It was he who boarded a flight to the US in mid-September 2008 with his close lieutenants to try to buy Lehman Brothers in the hours before it collapsed. While the collapse unleashed a wave of fear across global markets, it led to a massive opportunity for Diamond to buy just the Wall Street business and relocate back to his native America where his children were now studying after their early years at the American school in St John's Wood. The BarCap culture \u2013 inside a bank whose roots have Quaker origins \u2013 always jarred with the staid high street banking business, but even in City cultures was regarded as a testosterone-charged, alpha-male environment \u2013 surprising perhaps for a man who in the past has used his fortune to sponsor a chair of women's studies at Colby College in Maine. The current controversy over Libor rates is the toughest reputation hit BarCap has had to take. But it is by no means the first. Lord Mandelson once described Diamond as the \"unacceptable face\" of banking. There were also the four traders who celebrated with a lavish \u00a344,000 dinner at Petrus, Gordon Ramsay's restaurant; and the legal action against the Guardian to try to suppress details of tax avoidance schemes run by Barclays. Whistleblowers told the Guardian about poker games, a \"cow eating club\" and sackings inside the structured capital markets business inside BarCap. More recently, there was the high profile decision to shut down two tax avoidance schemes submitted to HM Revenue &amp; Customs by the bank, even before the bank revealed it had paid a \u00a35.7m tax bill incurred by Diamond when he was relocated back from New York to London to become chief executive in January 2011. In his years at the bank Diamond transformed Barclays' disastrous investment bank BZW into a reborn Barclays Capital (BarCap) and rejuvenated the fund manager Barclays Global Investors (BGI), sold off during the banking crisis to bolster the bank's coffers. John-Paul Crutchley, banks analyst at UBS, said: \"It is fair to say that there is no one individual who has imposed more of their vision, personality and character on a UK bank over the last decade than Bob Diamond at Barclays. From the creation of BarCap in 1997 to the acquisition of Lehman's US business and the sale of BGI \u2013 all were driven by Bob Diamond.\" With banks analysts and shareholders now questioning the over-reliance of Barclays on investment banking, Agius was careful yesterday not to say that Diamond's departure \u2013 or that of del Missier \u2013 would mark the dismantling of an investment banking empire which began with \"humble beginnings\" in 1997. An exhausted Agius instead paid tribute to Diamond, saying he had \"invigorated and focused the whole organisation\" in his 18 months as chief executive. \"We will miss his energy and vision,\" said Agius.",

      "bodyText": "The notoriety of Barclays' outgoing chief executive (Report, 3 July) should extend beyond his having presided over traders' attempts to manipulate interest rates, and the bank's role in mis-selling interest-rate derivatives. Bob Diamond also made Barclays the leading UK bank promoting speculation in the commodity derivative markets, which has exacerbated price volatility and contributed to dramatic food price spikes such as in 2008 and 2011. In each case Barclays has profited from complex derivatives at the expense of the real economy. The question is whether and how we can prevent history repeating itself. With the government favouring self-regulation of commodity derivatives markets rather than strict external controls, there is little hope of improvement. Deborah Doane Director, World Development Movement \u2022\u2008Having headed BarCap during the \"mis-selling\" of toxic mortgages and derivatives, and the investment arm of Barclays during the manipulation of Libor (Report, 28 June), Bob Diamond should be compelled to forgo any golden parachute he has arranged for himself.

      "body": "<p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jul/03/barclays-bank-of-england-email\" title=\"\">memo</a> from Bob Diamond to his boss, chief executive John Varley, on 29 October 2008, will dominate Wednesday's session of the Treasury select committee. It records Diamond's account of his conversation that day with Paul Tucker, a deputy governor of the Bank of England. Tucker is reported as saying senior figures in Whitehall wanted to know why Barclays' Libor submissions were so much higher than other banks'. Diamond replies that Barclays is not having to \"pay up\" for money and alleges that other banks are understating the level at which they are actually borrowing \u2013 in other words, Diamond claims rivals are suppressing their Libor submissions.</p> <p>Then comes the ambiguous, but potentially explosive, final line. Tucker, according to Diamond, said that \"it did not always need to be the case that we [Barclays] appeared as high as we have recently\".</p> <p>Jerry del Missier, Diamond's closest associate at Barclays Capital, was copied into the email. According to Barclays, del Missier \"concluded that an instruction had been passed down from the Bank of England not to keep Libors so high and he therefore passed down a direction to that effect to the submitters\".</p> <p>This version of events raises many questions \u2013 for Diamond, Barclays, the Bank, the Financial Services Authority and Treasury officials at the time.</p> <p><strong>1 </strong>Was Diamond's account of his conversation with Tucker accurate? We need to hear Tucker's version. But Diamond is on record as saying he did not believe he had been given an instruction from Tucker to lower the Libor rate.

      "bodyText": "The memo from Bob Diamond to his boss, chief executive John Varley, on 29 October 2008, will dominate Wednesday's session of the Treasury select committee. It records Diamond's account of his conversation that day with Paul Tucker, a deputy governor of the Bank of England. Tucker is reported as saying senior figures in Whitehall wanted to know why Barclays' Libor submissions were so much higher than other banks'. Diamond replies that Barclays is not having to \"pay up\" for money and alleges that other banks are understating the level at which they are actually borrowing \u2013 in other words, Diamond claims rivals are suppressing their Libor submissions. Then comes the ambiguous, but potentially explosive, final line. Tucker, according to Diamond, said that \"it did not always need to be the case that we [Barclays] appeared as high as we have recently\". Jerry del Missier, Diamond's closest associate at Barclays Capital, was copied into the email. According to Barclays, del Missier \"concluded that an instruction had been passed down from the Bank of England not to keep Libors so high and he therefore passed down a direction to that effect to the submitters\". This version of events raises many questions \u2013 for Diamond, Barclays, the Bank, the Financial Services Authority and Treasury officials at the time. 1 Was Diamond's account of his conversation with Tucker accurate? We need to hear Tucker's version. But Diamond is on record as saying he did not believe he had been given an instruction from Tucker to lower the Libor rate. Why did he not make this clear in his memo? Why did he leave an obvious ambiguity at the end given that Libor was such a hot issue within Barclays? 2 Was the memo discussed further between Varley, Diamond and del Missier? Put yourself in del Missier's shoes. You have just received a memo from your boss you believe is instructing you to fiddle the bank's Libor submission \u2013 an act that is categorically forbidden. Wouldn't you check if that was what Diamond really meant? Wouldn't you discuss it with him or, better, Varley? Wouldn't you object? A key question for MPs to ask Diamond is whether follow-up talks took place. 3 Why wasn't del Missier sacked when the board discovered his grave mistake in issuing the instruction to lower Libor submissions? Barclays' version is that del Missier acted alone. But, if that's the case, why were his services retained? He resigned because his position had become \"very difficult\", according to chairman Marcus Agius, even though no enforcement action was taken against him by the FSA. But surely, on Barclays' account, del Missier's position was equally difficult at the moment the board became aware of his actions \u2013 not three-and-a-half years after the events, and not a week after the publication of the FSA's report. 4 Did Tucker and the Bank believe the Libor market in the autumn of 2008 was riddled with false submissions? And did the Bank, explicitly or implicitly, encourage this situation? Barclays states that it \"firmly believed that the other panel members were not, in fact, funding at a lower cost than Barclays, and we were disappointed that no effective action was taken, notwithstanding our having raised these issues with various authorities during the whole financial crisis period\". On this account, Barclays portrays itself as banging its head against a wall when it complains that its submissions were honest but others' were not. Tucker's cute response, as recorded by Diamond, is \"oh, that would be worse\". Did the Bank investigate Barclays' allegations? Or, as Barclays implies, was Threadneedle Street, in the midst of a crisis, happy to tolerate readings that understated the true level of UK banks' funding difficulties? The Bank's position is this: \"It is nonsense to suggest the Bank of England was aware of any impropriety in the setting of Libor.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The \u00a3290m fine levied on Barclays for its role in manipulating Libor is the second time in less than two years that the British bank has been penalised by US regulators. Barclays was forced to pay $298m (\u00a3190m) to the US Department of Justice to settle August 2010 charges that it \"knowingly and willfully\" violated international sanctions, by handling hundreds of millions of dollars in clandestine transactions with banks in Cuba, Iran, Libya, Sudan and Burma. At the time of the deal Lanny A Breuer, the DoJ's assistant attorney general, said: \"Banks like Barclays will not be permitted to disregard sanctions put in place by the US government. Not just once, but numerous times over more than a decade, Barclays stripped vital information out of payment messages that would have alerted US financial institutions about the true origins of the funds.\" The Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R Vance Jr, added: \"Criminal activity of the type we found at Barclays does more than deceive our financial institutions, it threatens the security of our country.\" Documents filed at a federal court in Washington accused Barclays of handling money transfers totalling $500m from banks in prohibited countries through its dollar clearance branch in New York between 1995 and 2006. The bank accepted that staff at a payment processing centre in Poole, Dorset, had changed the wording in international money transfers to hide the fact the transactions involved countries barred from accessing the US financial system. Under a deferred prosecution agreement signed by Barclays' general counsel, Mark Harding, the bank agreed to pay $149m to the DoJ and a further $149m to the office of New York's district attorney, while committing to a string of measures to improve training and tighten internal procedures, as well as promising to co-operate with any further investigation by the US authorities. The bank, which has become a force on Wall Street since buying much of the US operation of the bankrupt Lehman Brothers in 2008, spent $250m on an internal inquiry that involved 100 million records and 300 interviews with 175 employees. The DoJ's 2010 statement added: \"In light of the bank's remedial actions to date and its willingness to acknowledge responsibility for its actions, the department will recommend the dismissal of the information in two years, provided Barclays fully co-operates with, and abides by, the terms of the deferred prosecution agreement.\" The justice department would not comment on whether the current Libor scandal will reactivate the sanction-busting charges approaching expiry, although it is understood that Barclays is in talks on that issue with the US judge in the case. The bank's Libor actions pre-date the 2010 deal. Barclays did not comment about the deferred prosecution, nor did it respond when asked if behaviour that attracts the attention of regulators was endemic within the bank. At the weekend, the business secretary, Vince Cable, wrote in the Observer: \"Incompetence, corruption and greed have been endemic in British banking\". Despite the large 2010 fine, there have been critics of the settlement. The judge in the case, Emmet Sullivan, questioned why the penalty was hitting investors' pockets rather than coming \"out of the assets of the board of directors\" and asked why nobody was \"standing up and taking criminal responsibility\" for the prohibited transactions. \"These are shocking charges. What the bank is being charged with is doing business with the enemy. These were prohibitions everyone in the banking community was aware of,\" he said. \"You don't believe the government is putting on kid gloves here at all?\" Prosecutors replied that they had been unable to find sufficient evidence to bring any individuals to trial, while top Barclays executives had been unaware of the transactions. Barclays was not alone in facing charges of violating international sanctions, which breached America's International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) and the Trading with the Enemy Act (TWEA). Lloyds TSB and Credit Suisse both settled with the US government in 2009 over similar dealings with institutions in repressive regimes. Similarly, Barclays is not the only bank being investigated over Libor and the US authorities, along with the UK's Financial Services Authority (FSA), has made it clear that further announcements on Libor should follow. Last week the FSA slapped a \u00a359.5m fine on the bank while US authorities hit Barclays with penalties of \u00a3230m for what were described as repeated breaches of rules dating back to 2005.",

      "bodyText": "Bob Diamond's resignation from Barclays today has focused even more attention on the London Interbank Offered rate - Libor - the rate at which banks lend to each other. Barclays was fined a record \u00a3290m by the Financial Services Authority and authorities in the US last week after an investigation found that the bank had been attempting to manipulate the level of Libor, a key benchmark interest rate used around the world to help set the price at which households, individuals and businesses can borrow. Phillip Inman has written this great guide to the key questions on Libor here. But the main points are. Sixteen banks are asked to predict what rate of interest they will be able to borrow at the next day. They send their predictions to Thomson Reuters, which calculates and publishes the benchmarks for the British Bankers Association (BBA). They do a pretty good guide to Libor here. Thomson Reuters calculates Libor by discarding the highest and the lowest submissions as outliers and then averaging the rest. The Libor rate also varies, depending on how long you are borrowing money for: there is a different rate for borrowing overnight, and for borrowing for a year, for example. Thousands of financial products are priced on the Libor rate because it is supposed to represent the real cost of money to the banks. In the same way that mortgage rates for first-time homebuyers are about 6% despite base rates being 0.5%, Libor can be much higher if enough banks are deemed risky and push up the average There will also be an inquiry into Libor, led by Conservative MP Andrew Tyrie. The scandal is around Barclays' role. Inman writes that: After Northern Rock went bust and there was a suspicion that Barclays was in trouble, a group of traders deliberately drove down the Libor rate. The lower the rate, the more it appeared that Barclays was healthy and able to survive the credit crunch. At other times, traders colluded with rival bank staff to make profits by driving up the interest rate You can read the FSA final notice on Barclays here. Thomson Reuters have given us the data for each bank from 2005 to 2008 - you can explore what happened to the US dollar Libor in this interactive here. It does show how each bank made their submission to Libor each day. Set the chart to late 2008 and you can see the huge impact of the financial crisis - banks which had previously lined up with each other start diverging wildly as chaos gripped the markets. Barclays is not the highest - in fact RBS consistently submitted for higher rates from July to December 2008, followed by German commercial bank WestLB.

The company encouraged sales reps in the US to mis-sell three drugs to doctors and lavished hospitality and kickbacks on those who agreed to write extra prescriptions, including trips to resorts in Bermuda, Jamaica and California. The company admitted corporate misconduct over the antidepressants Paxil and Wellbutrin and asthma drug Advair. Psychiatrists and their partners were flown to five-star hotels, on all-expenses-paid trips where speakers, paid up to $2,500 to attend, gave presentations on the drugs. They could enjoy diving, golf, fishing and other extra activities arranged by the company. GSK also paid for articles on its drugs to appear in medical journals and \"independent\" doctors were hired by the company to promote the treatments, according to court documents. Paxil \u2013 which was only approved for adults \u2013 was promoted as suitable for children and teenagers by the company despite trials that showed it was ineffective, according to prosecutors. Children and teenagers are only treated with antidepressants in exceptional circumstances due to an increased risk of suicide. GSK held eight lavish three-day events in 2000 and 2001 at hotels in Puerto Rico, Hawaii and Palm Springs, California, to promote the drug to doctors for unapproved use. Those who attended were given $750, free board and lodging and access to activities including snorkelling, golf, deep-sea fishing, rafting, glass-bottomed boat rides, hot-air balloon rides and, on one trip, a tour of the Bacardi rum distillery, all paid for by GSK. Air fares were also covered for doctors and spouses, in most cases, and speakers at the event were paid $2,500 each.

    "webTitle": "Sergio Pininfarina obituary", 
    "fields": {
      "standfirst": "Italian car designer, consultant and manufacturer", 
      "body": "<p>One of the miracles of the Italian post-second world war industrial revolution was the transformation of a few small motorcar coachbuilders into international style leaders that then became sought-after design consultants for the motor industry and, finally, completed the transition to making cars. Always at the forefront of these developments was the house of <a href=\"http://www.pininfarina.it/en/homepage/homepage.htm\" title=\"\">Pininfarina</a> whose head for 40 years was Sergio Pininfarina, who has died aged 85.</p> <p>The company was founded by his father, Battista Farina, who as the 10th of 11 children was nicknamed Pinin (\"the baby\") and in 1961 changed his surname to Pininfarina by presidential decree. Battista was apprenticed as a coachbuilder to his older brother Giovanni in the Stabilimenti Farina company, but in 1930 broke away and established his own company which he called Carrozzeria Pinin Farina (later Pininfarina). He was by then married, with a daughter, Gianna, and a son, Sergio, who was born in Turin.</p> <p>The new company's breakthrough came when it built a revolutionary coup\u00e9 body on a Cisitalia chassis in 1946, later selected by the <a href=\"http://www.moma.org/explore/multimedia/audios/280/3155\" title=\"\">Museum of Modern Art in New York</a> as an outstanding example of design. This full-width fastback design heralded a new era.</p> <p>Farina bodywork first appeared on a Ferrari in 1952, and the following year the company began series production of bodies for various models of Fiat, Alfa Romeo and Lancia. In 1955, with the <a href=\"http://www.carstyling.ru/ru/car/1955_lancia_florida/\" title=\"\">Florida body on a Lancia chassis</a>, Farina ushered in the new style of flat panels and sharp edges.</p> <p>The postwar fortunes of the company were directed by Battista's son-in-law, <a href=\"http://www.pininfarina.com/en/company/history/biographies/renzo_carli/renzo_carli.htm\" title=\"\">Renzo Carli</a>, and Sergio, who graduated as an engineer in Turin in 1950 and joined the family firm, becoming managing director in 1961. From the 403 saloon of 1955 onwards they designed many Peugeot cars, and made some of them. One of Sergio's first tasks was to manage the planning and construction of a new factory at Grugliasco, near Turin, to supplement the existing facilities in the city.</p> <p>The company then became a household name in the UK when the British Motor Corporation (BMC) appointed them as design consultants. The 1958 Austin A40 even adopted the name Farina. This model revolutionised small-car design with its two-box body without a protruding boot. It was followed by a range of larger saloons in 1959, and in 1962 by the Morris 1100 which was an astonishing combination of Pininfarina elegance with the engineering genius of Alec Issigonis. Issigonis hated \"stylists\" but made an exception of the Pininfarinas, who became great friends. The 1100 went on to become Britain's bestselling car.</p> <p>When his father died in 1966, Sergio took over as chair of the company. After BMC merged with British Leyland in 1968, the Pininfarina contract was cancelled by the chairman <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/jul/22/automotive.past\" title=\"\">Donald Stokes</a>, soon to become Lord Stokes, although not before Pininfarina had developed a stunning design for a \"Berlina Aerodinamica\" (aerodynamic saloon) based on the BMC 1800 car. It was turned down by British Leyland but provided inspiration for the Citro\u00ebn GS and CX, the Alfa Romeo Alfasud designed by Giorgetto Giugiaro, the Rover SD1 by David Bache and Pininfarina's own Lancia Gamma.</p> <p>Among Pininfarina's wilder flights of fancy was an even more streamlined shape, the X project of 1961, with four wheels in a diamond pattern; a year later, this was brought closer to reality with the Fiat-based project Y with a conventional wheel layout. Pininfarina's Sigma safety car design was shown in 1963, followed by a safety grand prix car in 1969. The Pininfarina-designed Peugeot 504 was European Car of the Year in 1969.

      "bodyText": "One of the miracles of the Italian post-second world war industrial revolution was the transformation of a few small motorcar coachbuilders into international style leaders that then became sought-after design consultants for the motor industry and, finally, completed the transition to making cars. Always at the forefront of these developments was the house of Pininfarina whose head for 40 years was Sergio Pininfarina, who has died aged 85. The company was founded by his father, Battista Farina, who as the 10th of 11 children was nicknamed Pinin (\"the baby\") and in 1961 changed his surname to Pininfarina by presidential decree. Battista was apprenticed as a coachbuilder to his older brother Giovanni in the Stabilimenti Farina company, but in 1930 broke away and established his own company which he called Carrozzeria Pinin Farina (later Pininfarina). He was by then married, with a daughter, Gianna, and a son, Sergio, who was born in Turin. The new company's breakthrough came when it built a revolutionary coup\u00e9 body on a Cisitalia chassis in 1946, later selected by the Museum of Modern Art in New York as an outstanding example of design. This full-width fastback design heralded a new era. Farina bodywork first appeared on a Ferrari in 1952, and the following year the company began series production of bodies for various models of Fiat, Alfa Romeo and Lancia. In 1955, with the Florida body on a Lancia chassis, Farina ushered in the new style of flat panels and sharp edges. The postwar fortunes of the company were directed by Battista's son-in-law, Renzo Carli, and Sergio, who graduated as an engineer in Turin in 1950 and joined the family firm, becoming managing director in 1961. From the 403 saloon of 1955 onwards they designed many Peugeot cars, and made some of them. One of Sergio's first tasks was to manage the planning and construction of a new factory at Grugliasco, near Turin, to supplement the existing facilities in the city. The company then became a household name in the UK when the British Motor Corporation (BMC) appointed them as design consultants. The 1958 Austin A40 even adopted the name Farina. This model revolutionised small-car design with its two-box body without a protruding boot. It was followed by a range of larger saloons in 1959, and in 1962 by the Morris 1100 which was an astonishing combination of Pininfarina elegance with the engineering genius of Alec Issigonis. Issigonis hated \"stylists\" but made an exception of the Pininfarinas, who became great friends. The 1100 went on to become Britain's bestselling car. When his father died in 1966, Sergio took over as chair of the company. After BMC merged with British Leyland in 1968, the Pininfarina contract was cancelled by the chairman Donald Stokes, soon to become Lord Stokes, although not before Pininfarina had developed a stunning design for a \"Berlina Aerodinamica\" (aerodynamic saloon) based on the BMC 1800 car. It was turned down by British Leyland but provided inspiration for the Citro\u00ebn GS and CX, the Alfa Romeo Alfasud designed by Giorgetto Giugiaro, the Rover SD1 by David Bache and Pininfarina's own Lancia Gamma. Among Pininfarina's wilder flights of fancy was an even more streamlined shape, the X project of 1961, with four wheels in a diamond pattern; a year later, this was brought closer to reality with the Fiat-based project Y with a conventional wheel layout. Pininfarina's Sigma safety car design was shown in 1963, followed by a safety grand prix car in 1969. The Pininfarina-designed Peugeot 504 was European Car of the Year in 1969. From 1967 the company pioneered the use of computers in design, and the automated digital measuring of car bodies. In 1972, for aerodynamic research, it opened the first full-size wind tunnel in Italy. In 1978 Pininfarina unveiled the CNR, which had an ideal aerodynamic shape, and jointly with Fiat proposed the Ecos small electric car.

Stephen Williams, the Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman, said it would reflect badly on parliament if it felt it could not conduct an inquiry into an issue like this.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Bob Diamond's departure from the chief executive's chair at Barclays leaves a vacancy that many analysts believe will be hard to fill. Without any obvious succession planning, the bank's board is being forced to cast its net wide and consider candidates from all corners of the industry. That said, there are several candidates who have emerged on the leaderboard. Bill Winters, a former investment banker at the second-largest bank in the US, JP Morgan Chase, is the most talked about candidate. He is cut from the same cloth as Diamond and would give shareholders the same sense of comfort that Barclays will make lots of money from its investment arm, Barclays Capital. Next in line are a group of insiders who, while not natural successors, know the bank and have a powerbase from which to launch their bid. Antony Jenkins, the head of retail and business banking, joined in 2009 and is credited with reducing customer complaints. Naguib Kheraj, the bank's vice-chairman, is a high-profile finance whiz who quit as finance director in early 2007, only to be lured back to take charge of an ultimately failed bid for Dutch bank ABN Amro and then again last year from Lazards into a strategic planning role. Christopher Lucas, a chartered accountant, is finance director. He joined in 2007, but was familiar with the organisation after five years as PricewaterhouseCoopers main link with the bank. David Roberts is another strong contender. Roberts, 50, lost out to Bob Diamond in the race to be chief executive after John Varley's early retirement. He quit the Barclays board in 2006 after more than 20 years service to run an Austrian bank before moving to Lloyds Banking Group to be chairman Win Bischoff's deputy. Last year, he was lined up to take over from Lloyds chief executive Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio should he fail to return after a period of ill-health. The blot on his copy book goes back to his time as head of personal financial services during a period when the sales of payment protection insurance accounted for more than 10% of the group's global profits. It's likely the apparent success of the division helped propel him onto the board, but the subsequent mis-selling scandal has cost the bank hundreds of millions of pounds in compensation. Hector Sants, the former boss of the City's main regulator, does not have a job to go to, though he is being forced to take six months' gardening leave, which will keep him out of circulation until Christmas. Sants was an investment banker and head of wholesale markets at the Financial Services Authority in the runup to the financial crisis, before taking on the chief executive role only months before the Northern Rock disaster. He would allow Barclays to present a squeaky clean image after his efforts to clean up the industry, but the board needs someone now, making him a long shot. Benny Higgins, the chief executive of Tesco's Edinburgh-based bank, is another name in the frame. The qualified actuary was credited with running a conservative mortgage loan operation during a stint at Halifax between 2006/07, though he was unable to offset the excesses of the Bank of Scotland division that eventually forced Halifax first into the arms of Lloyds and then the taxpayer. The Barclays board may baulk at the tangled love life of the 51-year-old, who is four times married and spent time in court last year battling over the maintenance of his then 11-year-old daughter by his third wife. Gary Hoffman, who came to prominence as boss of the nationalised Northern Rock, was on the Barclays board at the time of the credit crunch. Hoffman left Northern Rock to make his fortune as a private-equity boss. He attempted to build a banking empire that included buying Northern Rock from the government. But Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Group beat him to it and he has since dropped his plans. Ladbrokes have put odds of 100-1 on Gordon Brown taking the helm, though it could add Tony Blair and Sir John Major to the list if there is any inclination to employ an out-of-work senior politician.",

Diamond and other executives said they would waive their bonuses this year, in the hope that would resolve the matter. But the furore did not die down.</p> <h2>When did Diamond resign?<br></h2> <p>The Barclays board and Diamond met on Monday night to discuss his position.

      "bodyText": "Why has Bob Diamond resigned? As chief executive of Barclays, he is paying the price for the growing scandal over the bank's attempt to manipulate the interbank lending rates, Libor and Euribor, key benchmark interest rates used around the world to help set the price at which households, individuals and businesses can borrow. Last week the Financial Services Authority (FSA) and its US counterparts revealed they had fined Barclays \u00a3290m for trying to rig Libor and Euribor between 2006 and 2009. The authorities made it clear that other banks would also be in the firing line and released emails sent between traders and rate setters asking for the rate to be rigged. One of the emails read: \"Dude. I owe you big time! Come over one day after work and I'm opening a bottle of Bollinger.\" Barclays said 12 traders had been sacked and the problems had been addressed as soon as they were made aware. Diamond and other executives said they would waive their bonuses this year, in the hope that would resolve the matter. But the furore did not die down. When did Diamond resign? The Barclays board and Diamond met on Monday night to discuss his position. Marcus Agius (who was, at that time, the former chairman) then called the chancellor, George Osborne, to let him know. The stock market was informed through the Regulatory News Service at 7.30am on Tuesday in an announcement filed under the fairly dull title \"Board changes\". It revealed Agius would take over as executive chairman and Diamond would resign with immediate effect. Hadn't Marcus Agius resigned? He did on Monday in a failed attempt to save Diamond, who just 24 hours ago told staff he was staying: \"I love Barclays, and I am proud of all of you. We all know that these events are not representative of our culture, and it is my responsibility to get to the bottom of that and resolve it.\" Agius will take on the chairmanship in an executive role, ie full-time, to search for a new chief executive, partly because regulators could insist that the company should not continue without a chairman and chief executive. Who is in the running to take over? The former investment banker Bill Winters, who sat on the independent commission on banking, is the early frontrunner to replace Diamond. He was also co-CEO of the investment bank JP Morgan Chase \u2013 one of the few banks to come out of the credit crunch relatively unscathed. What payoff will Diamond get? It's too early to say. But investors will be certain to push for it to be the lowest level possible. He has earned \u00a3100m in the last six years working for Barclays. Will he still appear at the Treasury select committee? Yes. The committee hearings on Wednesday and Thursday are still going ahead, with Diamond appearing on the first day and Agius the next. Will Diamond leave quietly? Unlikely. He no longer has the burden of having to cling on to his position when he sits in front of MPs in Portcullis House on Wednesday.

More importantly, Barclays must quickly refocus attention on to its attractive organic story and undervalued \"defensive\" franchise.</p> <p>\"We are disappointed by Bob's resignation this morning. That said, it is undeniable that the unrelenting political/media campaign had centred on Bob personally, and this was leading to a persistent misrepresentation of Barclays' position in relation to the multi-bank Libor investigations, and a clear distraction from the execution of Barclays's strategic repositioning. The significant challenge to Barclays 'new' executive chairman, Marcus Aigus, is to turn this situation to his advantage.</p> <p>\"With Bob gone, expect increased recognition that the Libor investigation is a multi-bank issue rather than Barclays-specific.

We've seen that business leaders, like politicians, try to hang on in these circumstances but eventually they do go.\"</p> <h2><strong>Mark Field, Conservative MP for City of London and Westminster</strong></h2> <p>\"This is a sensible and pragmatic decision and Bob Diamond was bowing to the inevitable. This story was likely to run and run for a considerable amount of time. From Bob Diamond's point of view he recognised the longer he stayed there was going to be more reputational damage.</p> <p>\"We are going to see a much more collegiate and pragmatic, steady-as-she-goes, approach at the top of banks&#xa0;\u2026 The days of emperors at the top of banks is over.\"</p>",

If there is 'new news' to share (whether embarrassing to UK regulators or otherwise) Bob can now speak more freely at the select committee showtrial tomorrow. More importantly, Barclays must quickly refocus attention on to its attractive organic story and undervalued \"defensive\" franchise. \"We are disappointed by Bob's resignation this morning. That said, it is undeniable that the unrelenting political/media campaign had centred on Bob personally, and this was leading to a persistent misrepresentation of Barclays' position in relation to the multi-bank Libor investigations, and a clear distraction from the execution of Barclays's strategic repositioning. The significant challenge to Barclays 'new' executive chairman, Marcus Aigus, is to turn this situation to his advantage. \"With Bob gone, expect increased recognition that the Libor investigation is a multi-bank issue rather than Barclays-specific. In the short term, it has not been well served or rewarded for its co-operation with the regulators, and as discussed in our note yesterday, we expect Barclays's sharp share price underperformance to reverse as the market takes a more dispassionate look at the facts.\" David Jones of IG Index \"From an investor's point of view, it was expected. We've seen that business leaders, like politicians, try to hang on in these circumstances but eventually they do go.\" Mark Field, Conservative MP for City of London and Westminster \"This is a sensible and pragmatic decision and Bob Diamond was bowing to the inevitable. This story was likely to run and run for a considerable amount of time. From Bob Diamond's point of view he recognised the longer he stayed there was going to be more reputational damage. \"We are going to see a much more collegiate and pragmatic, steady-as-she-goes, approach at the top of banks \u2026 The days of emperors at the top of banks is over.\"",

      "bodyText": "Bob Diamond has resigned from Barclays in the face of relentless political pressure for him to go following the interest rate manipulation scandal. An attempt by the board to save his position by accepting the resignation of the chairman, Marcus Agius, on Monday has failed. Instead Agius will now become full-time chairman and lead the search for a new chief executive. In a stunning turnaround \u2013 only on Monday the 60-year old chief executive was vowing to stay \u2013 Diamond is to go immediately after a 15-year career with the bank and only 18 months as chief executive. Diamond's resignation was welcomed by the government, which has come under increasing pressure to launch a public inquiry into the scandal. George Osborne, speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, said it was \"the right decision for Barclays \u2013 and for the country\". \"I think Bob Diamond's resignation is the first step towards the new age of responsibility we need to see.\" Asked whether he had played a part in Diamond's exit, the chancellor denied it, saying he was not in his job to decide who ran Britain's banks. Osborne also condemned the City's \"corrupt practices\", suggesting that criminal cases over the bank's manipulation of the inter-bank lending rate would follow, even though no one responsible has yet been charged with any offence. Ed Miliband said Diamond's departure was \"necessary and right\", but repeated his call for a public inquiry. \"This is about more than one man,\" the Labour leader said. \"This is about the culture and practices of the entire banking system which is why we need an independent, open, judge-led, public inquiry.\" But Diamond's decision to quit \u2013 and the return of Agius \u2013 dismayed some in the City.

    "sectionName": "Business", 
    "webTitle": "David Cameron orders speedy bank inquiry", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "David Cameron has tried to fend off growing demands for a public inquiry into the loss of trust in British banking by announcing a quick parliamentary inquiry into professional and cultural standards in the industry. Desperate to avoid being wrong-footed, as he was last summer over Labour calls for a public inquiry into phone hacking, Cameron and the chancellor, George Osborne, tried to seize the political initiative by claiming the cross-party inquiry could examine how the previous government had left the City so unregulated. Cameron's proposed inquiry, including peers and MPs, will be chaired by Andrew Tyrie, the respected Conservative chairman of the Treasury select committee. It will not have an inbuilt Tory majority. Witnesses can be compelled to give evidence under oath. It is due to report by the end of December and will be provided with extra research resources by the Treasury. It will look into what lessons can be learned in relation to \"transparency, conflicts of interest, culture and the professional standards of the banking industry\". Previously ministers had rejected Labour's call for a retrospective inquiry, but on Monday morning Downing Street changed tack, sensing potential revenge for the agony caused by the Leveson inquiry by turning attention to Labour's role in allowing the Libor interest rate scandal now engulfing Barclays bank. But the government also argued that a speedy inquiry could draw up recommendations in time for inclusion in a banking bill next spring, implementing the Vickers Commission report on dividing retail and so-called casino banking. Osborne told MPs: \"We need to get on with this \u2013 not spend years on costly navel-gazing when we know what has gone wrong.\" The announcement came as the resignation of the Barclays chairman, Marcus Agius, failed to puncture the pressure enveloping the bank since it was slapped with a record \u00a3290m fine for attempting to manipulate interest rates. With politicians continuing to call for the chief executive to step aside, Bob Diamond issued a memo to staff in which he made clear he had no intention of leaving. \"I am disappointed because many of these behaviours happened on my watch. It is my responsibility to make sure that it cannot happen again,\" Diamond said. He will appear before Tyrie's Treasury select committee on Wednesday . Agius, who earned \u00a3751,000 a year, is on six months' notice and will stay while a successor is found after saying he was \"truly sorry\" for the interest rate rigging scandal that has dealt a \"devastating blow\" to the bank's reputation. \"As chairman, I am the ultimate guardian of the bank's reputation. Accordingly, the buck stops with me and I must acknowledge responsibility by standing aside,\" Agius said. But some shareholders disagree and believe the new chairman \u2013 whose appointment could take as along as six months and requires approval from the Financial Services Authority \u2013 should be responsible for finding a successor to Diamond. Barclays' shares, which had lost \u00a34bn in value in 72 hours after the fine was announced last Friday, edged higher to close 3% up, but with still much ground to regain after the 15% fall. As well as the parliamentary inquiry and the select committee session, Barclays will also have to weather further scrutiny of its alleged role in manipulating Libor (the London interbank offered rate). In the Commons yesterday, the housing minister Grant Shapps acknowledged that the Libor scandal could have contributed to home repossessions. Osborne appointed Martin Wheatley, the Financial Conduct Authority chairman-designate, to run a separate narrow inquiry into the future setting of Libor, the rate at which banks lend between themselves. Osborne urged the Serious Fraud Office to use every avenue to prosecute Barclays traders who may have broken the law. Labour vowed to press for a full public inquiry and dismissed Cameron's remedy as a case of the \"establishment closing ranks around its own\". Labour did not say if it would boycott the parliamentary inquiry if it could not persuade Cameron to change his plans. Labour fears that an inquiry led by a politician \u2013 rather than a judge \u2013 will descend into partisan point-scoring grew when Cameron immediately pointed out that it could take evidence from former City ministers and special advisers, a reference to Ed Balls and Ed Miliband. Osborne said Balls was the City minister at the time of the Libor scandal, and predicted the inquiry would find out in due course what Balls and the former prime minister Gordon Brown knew about that scandal. Labour accused Osborne of being obsessed with blaming the last Labour government for every action of every banker. Balls tried to widen responsibility for the bankers' actions over the last decade: \"The public are angry and they rightly ask whether this generation of politicians, regulators and banks can put right these wrongs.\" He added: \"We should all admit that regulation should have been tougher and we should all learn the lessons of an open judicial led inquiry.\" The ex-chancellor Alistair Darling said: \"This inquiry will only work if it is a genuine examination of what went wrong. But if looks like a partisan exercise in settling scores between the political parties, it will not work. The public may not like bankers, but they do not like politicians either.\" Barclays was fined for attempting to fix Libor and the European equivalent, Euribor \u2013 two benchmarks that are the basis for pricing an array of financial products, potentially affecting the price at which households and businesses borrow money.",

Barclays' shares, which had lost \u00a34bn in value in 72 hours after the fine was announced last Friday, edged higher to close 3% up, but with still much ground to regain after the 15% fall.</p> <p>As well as the parliamentary inquiry and the select committee session, Barclays will also have to weather further scrutiny of its alleged role in manipulating Libor (the London interbank offered rate). In the Commons yesterday, the housing minister Grant Shapps acknowledged that the Libor scandal could have contributed to home repossessions.</p> <p>Osborne appointed Martin Wheatley, the Financial Conduct Authority chairman-designate, to run a separate narrow inquiry into the future setting of Libor, the rate at which banks lend between themselves. Osborne urged the Serious Fraud Office to use every avenue to prosecute Barclays traders who may have broken the law.</p> <p>Labour vowed to press for a full public inquiry and dismissed Cameron's remedy as a case of the \"establishment closing ranks around its own\". Labour did not say if it would boycott the parliamentary inquiry if it could not persuade Cameron to change his plans.</p> <p>Labour fears that an inquiry led by a politician \u2013 rather than a judge \u2013 will descend into partisan point-scoring grew when Cameron immediately pointed out that it could take evidence from former City ministers and special advisers, a reference to Ed Balls and Ed Miliband. Osborne said Balls was the City minister at the time of the Libor scandal, and predicted the inquiry would find out in due course what Balls and the former prime minister Gordon Brown knew about that scandal. Labour accused Osborne of being obsessed with blaming the last Labour government for every action of every banker. Balls tried to widen responsibility for the bankers' actions over the last decade: \"The public are angry and they rightly ask whether this generation of politicians, regulators and banks can put right these wrongs.\"</p> <p>He added: \"We should all admit that regulation should have been tougher and we should all learn the lessons of an open judicial led inquiry.\"</p> <p>The ex-chancellor Alistair Darling said: \"This inquiry will only work if it is a genuine examination of what went wrong. But if looks like a partisan exercise in settling scores between the political parties, it will not work. The public may not like bankers, but they do not like politicians either.\"</p> <p>Barclays was fined for attempting to fix Libor and the European equivalent, Euribor \u2013 two benchmarks that are the basis for pricing an array of financial products, potentially affecting the price at which households and businesses borrow money.</p>",
