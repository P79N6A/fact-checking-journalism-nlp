      "bodyText": "Regulators must be given significant new \u201cUS-style\u201d powers to tackle the escalating problem of online fraud in the wake of the cyberattack that potentially potentially compromised the security of millions of TalkTalk customers, IT experts said. Their call came amid warnings that the security breach at the telecoms provider could cause problems for its victims that will last for years. Some TalkTalk customers have complained that their bank accounts and credit cards have been targeted since Wednesday\u2019s attack. But the TalkTalk chief executive, Dido Harding, insisted the data stolen in the cyberattack would not allow criminals to plunder customers\u2019 bank accounts. TalkTalk said complete credit card details are not stored in its system and that account passwords were not accessed. \u201cWe now expect the amount of financial information that may have been accessed to be materially lower than initially believed and would on its own not enable a criminal to take money from your account,\u201d a spokesman added. Earlier in the week, experts had warned the information seized \u2013 including names, addresses, date of birth, and email address of some of its four million customers \u2013 could still prove invaluable to criminals. \u201cWith this level of information, fraudsters can create new bank accounts or take out loans under an actual person\u2019s name, causing problems for fraud victims for years down the road,\u201d said Ryan Wilk, director with NuData Security. Experts predicted that the company could expect a grilling from the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office which has issued guidance to customers who fear their personal details may have been accessed by criminals. It is likely to be asked about what steps it has taken to comply with stringent PCI/DSS regulations \u2013 the global standards set up by transaction companies such as MasterCard and Visa \u2013 that require companies to silo and isolate sensitive financial data. Firms have to complete a PCI audit every year. How TalkTalk responded to the audits may be crucial as to whether it is fined by the ICO, suggested Dr Simon Moores, a former government technology adviser and chair of the International eCrime Congress, the industry body that brings together IT professionals working for governments and law enforcement agencies. The ICO can impose penalties of up to \u00a3500,000 for companies that allow data protection breaches. But this is only a fraction of the amount that can be imposed in the US. Telecom giant AT&amp;T was recently fined \u00a317m over data breaches at its call centres in Mexico, Colombia and the Philippines. \u201cIn light of the TalkTalk debacle, not only must the ICO review its powers and the levels of fine it can apply against companies shown to be remiss in looking after their customers, but the Financial Conduct Authority and parliament need to look more closely at this, given the extent of data breaches starting to appear,\u201d Moores said. Politicians on all sides signalled that they believed the law needed an overhaul. Former home office minister Hazel Blears described the TalkTalk data breach as \u201ca wake-up call\u201d that should prompt a debate about whether further regulation was needed, suggesting cybercrime was \u201cprobably the biggest threat to our economy\u201d. Labour shadow cabinet minister Chi Onwurah has tabled parliamentary questions for the Department of Culture, Media and Sport asking how victims of data breaches can be informed and compensated. \u201cWhen you lose somebody\u2019s data, you give the thieves a gateway into people\u2019s lives,\u201d Onwurah said. \u201cI\u2019m calling for a code of practice to encourage companies to take greater responsibility for data loss so that if an insurer loses your details and you get a hundred calls a week flogging PPI they have to compensate you.\u201d Some experts have called for the government to give a cabinet minister clear responsiblity for cybersecurity. At the moment various Whitehall departments have a role in countering the threat. Joanna Sheilds, minister for internet safety and security, has a brief largely focused on protecting children online. Questions remain about who was behind the attack. TalkTalk said it had been contacted by someone seeking a ransom payment, but the company was not sure if the message was genuine. Harding said that \u201cwith the benefit of hindsight\u201d, it was evident that TalkTalk had not done enough to protect itself. The latest breach is the third in a spate of cyber-attacks affecting the company in the last eight months. In August its mobile sales site was hit. In February its customers were warned about scammers who stole thousands of account numbers and names from the company\u2019s computers. In response to reports that it had been warned by experts about its security, a spokesman for the firm said: \u201cNew techniques for attack develop all the time, so TalkTalk constantly updates and reviews our systems to try to stay one step ahead of cybercriminals. Since the previous attacks, we are working with world leading cybersecurity experts and investing a lot in making sure our system is as secure as possible. Unfortunately, no system is ever totally invincible.\u201d The company\u2019s accounts, published in June, reveal that a Head of Security was appointed \u201cto establish and oversee the new Security Operations Centre, the activities of which have been outsourced to cyber security experts BAe systems.\u201d But, despite its efforts, Moores said searching questions would be asked about the company and its management. Moores said: \u201cEverything we have seen suggests that Talk Talk historically may have failed to take reasonable steps and that the CEO appears completely out of touch with the risks that are widely described. For that at least, she will have to answer to both her board and her customers.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s diplomatic elite has been rushed off its feet catering for the largest contingent of Chinese officials and business executives to arrive in London for 10 years. In 2005, the chief concern was how to contain the noise from protesters angry at Beijing\u2019s occupation of Tibet. This time the Dalai Lama and talk of human rights were kept off the agenda during a four-day visit that David Cameron said was the opening act in a \u201cgolden era\u201d for UK-China relations. In a joint statement, Cameron and President Xi Jinping said they were committed to creating \u201ca global comprehensive strategic partnership for the 21st century,\u201d and exploiting to the full Xi\u2019s \u201cone belt, one road\u201d policy that aims to turn the old Silk Road into a modern trade route across Asia to the Middle East and Europe. However, one comment in particular stood out: when the prime minister hailed \u201cup to \u00a340bn\u201d of trade and investment deals between Britain and China as he attended a trade conference at Mansion House in the City of London. There was some incredulity over how Downing Street had arrived at the number, and No 10 eventually issued a list at the end of Xi\u2019s visit that acknowledged the total included previously announced agreements. Nonetheless, it underlined that the British economy has links with China in many different sectors \u2013 from carmaking to TV programming. But it remains to be seen whether the announcements, analysed below, will amount to a significant trade boost. TRADE LINKS China now represents the UK\u2019s sixth-biggest export market, taking 3.6% of its goods and services. But some analysts characterise Xi\u2019s visit as all one-way traffic, with a grateful Britain buying almost anything China had to offer, from nuclear technology to investment funds for the HS2 rail line, with only a handful of Chinese purchases of UK goods and services going the other way. Critics have also characterised many of the deals as largely symbolic and spread over many years, diminishing their value in the context of overall investment in the UK. But for Xi the willingness of the UK to embrace China is a much-needed fillip as he struggles with an economy suffering from massive overcapacity, especially in the steel, coal and building sectors, where official data suggests factories have the ability to produce up to 30% more than current demand. A huge drop in exports and efforts to shift the away from heavy industries to consumer services has also slowed growth to a pace dubbed by Xi as the \u201cnew normal\u201d. And even these lower estimates from the government statistics department could be generous with independent efforts to measure the economy downgrading growth in the last quarter from 6.9% to nearer 4% and an unemployment rate that hovers just above 4% to the dangerously high 10%. Launched in 2013, \u201cOne Belt, One Road\u201d is Xi\u2019s route out of the malaise. Beijing estimates it will add \u00a31.7tn to China\u2019s trade in the next decade, as it seeks overseas destinations for products that have no home in a saturated domestic market. Britain is one of many such destinations. NUCLEAR The flagship industrial project for the \u201cgolden era\u201d of cooperation is the \u00a36bn investment by China in the planned new Hinkley Point C nuclear plant in Somerset. The British government is relieved that state-owned China General Nuclear Power Corporation has bailed out the cash-strapped main developer, EDF of France, and promised to take a 33.5% equity stake in the controversial project. The quid pro quo for the Chinese participating, and for providing cash for new reactors at Sizewell in Suffolk, is to be allowed to build and operate their own facility at Bradwell in Essex. Bradwell will allow the Chinese to trial its Hualong reactor designs in the west and act as a showcase to the rest of the world for its nuclear prowess. New investment money coming into Britain\u2019s creaking energy infrastructure is considered the main UK benefit at a time when over \u00a3100bn is needed to update old power stations and introduce new low-carbon power. EDF has promised that 60% of the contracts at Hinkley will go to the UK although the plant will use a French reactor design, the EPR, and engineering via another French company Areva. British companies such as Laing O\u2019Rourke, Balfour Beatty, and Cavendish Nuclear are in line for significant contracts, with G4S a bidder for security contracts and Somerset Larder for the catering. The biggest boost should be 25,000 new jobs, but the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors warned last week the UK \u201clacks the necessary construction skills to deliver critical programme such as Hinkley Point.\u201d VISAS AND CULTURAL EXCHANGE Xi made much of the demands from China\u2019s new middle-class consumers for foreign goods and travel. He said that over the next five years, China would import the equivalent of \u00a36.5tn of goods and that 500 million Chinese tourists would travel abroad. To make sure Britain stays on the map, Cameron said that, from January, new visitor visas for Chinese tourists would be valid for two years \u2013 four times the usual six-month limit. He also pledged to match the US government\u2019s latest 10-year multi-entry visa for Chinese tourists at no extra cost. Why single out Chinese tourists for special attention? They contribute \u00a3500m a year to the UK economy, according to the latest figures from VisitBritain and the numbers are increasing rapidly. There was a 35% jump in visitors from China in the year to June on 2014. With every Chinese holidaymaker and business traveller spending on average \u00a32,688 every time they visit, \u201cthe extension of the visitor visa will enable them to maximise their spending power even further,\u201d said Downing Street, adding that every 22 additional Chinese visitors create an additional job in the tourism sector. INDUSTRY Low-carbon technology was at the heart of deals struck with China across the automotive sector during Xi\u2019s visit. Aston Martin signed a deal worth \u00a350m with private equity firm China Equity to develop an electric sports car, the Rapide S. The Chinese carmaker Geely, which makes London\u2019s distinctive black cabs, promised to pump in an extra \u00a350m to research and development at an expanded Coventry factory, including the launch of a new fleet of hybrid black cabs capable of zero emissions. And bus manufacturer Alexander Dennis agreed a \u00a3660m deal to build single-decker buses that China\u2019s BYD will equip with batteries to run as electric vehicles. Ian Fletcher at IHS Automotive says even the smaller deals now represent significant investment: \u201cUnfortunately our homegrown industry isn\u2019t as big as it once was, so it\u2019s a feather in the cap. The investment in R&amp;D for a new London taxi does suggest that we still have strengths in engineering in that field: had you said that London Taxi would get a total \u00a3300m investment from abroad five years ago, they\u2019d have said you were mad. Geely do see something in that brand, they are probably eyeing more exports.\u201d Meanwhile, Fletcher says, the injection of funding will be important for Aston Martin. \u201cElectric vehicles are a growing market, but there hasn\u2019t been that much movement at the top end. It\u2019s an opportunity for Aston Martin to become a super-Tesla \u2013 and, with the Chinese government very focused on trying to reduce emissions in their cities, to sell into that market.\u201d CREATIVE INDUSTRIES The UK\u2019s creative and TV production industry struck deals worth more than \u00a3225m with Chinese partners in a flurry of announcements. The deals included BBC Worldwide\u2019s co-production deal with Shanghai Media Group to make the sequel to 2007 hit Earth, the feature-length version of the Planet Earth series, due for release in 2017. It is the first deal completed under the Sino-UK Film co-production treaty ratified earlier this year. Other deals include co-production agreements to make a Chinese version of the BBC series Coast. And Chinese online video company LeTV picked up the broadcast rights to Poldark, while this year\u2019s Sherlock Christmas special will transfer to cinemas across China. Other initiatives include the University of York striking a \u00a3200m TV training programme deal with a Chinese investment group that will involve 300 foreign students a year. While the list of glossy announcements is impressive, China remains a difficult market for UK TV producers to crack. According to indie trade body Pact, sales of British TV shows to China were just \u00a316m last year, with growth of just 1%, down on a 40% surge in 2013. \u201cChina still seems to be mostly a case of a long walk for a short drink,\u201d says one senior executive. PROPERTY Even before last week\u2019s visit, China had been busy investing in the UK. The country has amassed a huge fortune in foreign reserves from exports, and until the financial crash parked much of it in US Treasury bonds. These days property is the asset of choice, sometimes to the point of investing in apartment blocks that remain empty simply because it is too much hassle to rent them out. Investments in the UK are mainly in London and will soon grab the attention with a development on the river Thames at Nine Elms by Chinese developers Dalian Wanda. The massive towers planned for the area upriver from the Houses of Parliament have already been branded a super-rich playground with flats starting at \u00a31.3m. Cameron was only able to lay claim to a small investment by the Chinese developer Advanced Business Park (ABP) in the \u00a31.7bn Royal Albert Docks scheme as part of Xi\u2019s visit. But the scheme \u2013 also involving fellow Chinese group Citic, which already owns 40% of that site \u2013 is billed as developing a new financial district in east London that will create up to 30,000 jobs. As a signal of intent, it is clear. Beijing wants to take over from the oil-rich Middle Eastern states as the main investor in London\u2019s trophy assets. FINANCE In a deal timed to coincide with Xi\u2019s visit, China\u2019s central bank made its first sale of debt on London\u2019s markets last week, drawing orders of more than 30bn yuan (\u00a33bn). The move is mutually beneficial: it aids China\u2019s drive to make the yuan an international currency, while consolidating London\u2019s position as a global financial centre. The City treasures its reputation as the most international financial centre in the world. It plays host to many more foreign banks than either New York or Tokyo and in recent years added Middle Eastern banks wanting to sell products under sharia law to a list that includes banks from every continent. Last week\u2019s debt sale was not the only example of Sino-British cooperation in finance. In 2014 the China Construction Bank won approval from Beijing to open Europe\u2019s first clearing bank for yuan in London. Later it also started trading in Paris and Frankfurt, but made London its European headquarters. CCB UK, which spent around \u00a3110m on a new headquarters in the Square Mile, processed around 6bn yuan of transactions per day last year. Last week the Chicago Mercantile Exchange announced that its London trading centre would offer offshore yuan futures, allowing financiers to trade and hedge on movements in China\u2019s currency. The move will bring to London a practice that was previously conducted through Hong Kong. This article was amended on 30 October 2015 to correct the name of the Nine Elms developer to Dalian Wanda.",

      "bodyText": "Steadily declining GDP growth, excess capacity, deflation, a stock market crisis, big currency outflows. Is this some troubled European nation? No, it is Britain\u2019s new best friend, China. But on his visit last week, Xi Jinping, the People\u2019s Republic\u2019s most powerful leader since Mao Zedong, was portrayed as a benevolent dispenser of cash who would enable George Osborne to square his circle of cutting the deficit but boosting infrastructure. Seeing the absence of thought-out policy towards China, the chancellor jumped in with both boots. It would be nice if British exports increased, but our leading export sectors \u2013 financial services and education, say \u2013 are stymied by the restrictive nature of the regime. Instead, he played for Chinese money to build a high-speed train link, develop northern England and expand the nuclear industry. The political implications of being Beijing\u2019s best friend are considerable. But one issue unaddressed is the economic nature of the UK\u2019s new bedfellow, and what that partner wants from the embrace. China is in economic transition. How this turns out is the most important issue in the global economy. The era of cheap labour, cheap capital and strong export markets is gone. The plan is to boost consumption instead, but progress has been slow. Retail sales were rising at 10-12% a year but the rate of increase has fallen slightly. The government has tried a string of stimulus measures: interest rates have been cut six times in the past year. These enabled China to avoid a hard landing whose effects would resonate around the world, but the economy is dogged by excess capacity. This is as high as 30% in steel, leading to cheap exports that hammered another nail into the coffin of Britain\u2019s steel industry. In the past, economic policy was run by bureaucrats under the gaze of the Politburo. China is the last big Leninist state in which the party is more powerful than the government and ever more so under Xi, whose position as party head is far more important than that of president. But now, the politicians have moved into economic policy. This summer\u2019s attempt to create a strong stock market was their doing and killed equities. There are a lot of Chinese bureaucrats who understand markets, but the political leaders, nurtured in the party cocoon, do not. Xi Jinping is trying to craft a more expansive foreign policy, and Britain is useful in this. The People\u2019s Republic can hope to see the UK abstain if it comes under criticism in the UN Security Council, and to argue against EU anti-dumping schemes while backing the free trade pact China is seeking. Beijing will expect investment in Britain to translate into contracts for Chinese companies. China first rolled out this policy among its western neighbours with its one belt, one road policy for Pakistan and central Asia. Now it\u2019s Britain\u2019s turn. The rationale is simple \u2013 give countries money from China\u2019s abundant foreign exchange reserves, and they will reciprocate with contracts that help mainland companies suffering from declining domestic demand. As the Chinese economy slows, Xi Jinping\u2019s gift-giving comes with a powerful motive.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s been nearly 50 years since Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper rode out on their custom Harley-Davidsons in Easy Rider. Fonda and Hopper live on in American culture \u2013 long-haired, wild-eyed expressions of bad boy cool. The motorcycles they rode? Not so much. If the 100-year-old company\u2019s recent financial results are any indication, the image of Harley-Davidson bikes as the quintessential American two-wheeler may be fading. The US motorcycle manufacturer\u2019s market share slid nearly 4% last quarter. To make matters worse, it also announced that it would scale back production and cut jobs. The problem may well rest with Easy Rider \u2013 or at least the generation that spawned it. Those old enough to remember the movie may snap up the T-shirts, keychains, lawn flags and various other consumer products festooned with Harley-Davidson logos, but the Milwaukee-based manufacturer doesn\u2019t seem to have the reach it once did. \u201cThe younger generation has no interest in Harley-Davidson as far as I can tell,\u201d Michelle Krebs, an analyst for Kelley Blue Book, said in an email. \u201cUnless you ride a motorcycle or scooter in a city as your transportation, motorcycles are a splurge millennials can\u2019t afford and have no interest in \u2013 especially Harley-Davidson, which seems like a old white-guy brand.\u201d Old school still has its appeal. But other brands have been gaining traction with retro looks at Harley\u2019s expense. Polaris Industries \u2013 a company best known for manufacturing snowmobiles and ATVs \u2013 revived the once-celebrated Indian brand. Indian seems to have upped the Americana ante, offering fringed leather saddle bags and classic 1940s styling aimed at direct competition with Harley. Ducati unveiled a retro model called the Scrambler last year, increasing the Italian manufacturer\u2019s sales by 22%. But there may be something else \u2013 a deeper cultural issue \u2013 that\u2019s at the root of Harley\u2019s trouble. The company\u2019s bikes, which have always been a platform for customization, have become more available in \u201ccustom\u201d trim straight from the factory, complete with dealer-supplied financing packages. \u201cIt\u2019s not cool if everyone else has the same stuff as you,\u201d Carlos Dos Santos, owner of Brooklyn Motorworks, a New York motorcycle repair and customization shop said. \u201cThey\u2019re flooding the market with these cookie-cutter bikes, and it\u2019s not special any more if everyone can just buy instant cool.\u201d Brian Robbins, a longtime Harley enthusiast and one of Dos Santos\u2019 customers, said that personal expression was important to many in the motorcycle crowd. \u201cIf I\u2019m going to spend my disposable income on a bike, I want it to be unique,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to drop $40,000 on my bike and have some guy roll up at a light riding the same thing. Ever.\u201d Dos Santos suggested that Harley\u2019s strong sales in the past may have led to over-production. He also explained that as Harley has begun offering directly from the factory trick wheels, louder exhausts and other accessories that were once the purview of aftermarket companies, aftermarket innovators like Roland Sands Design have focused their efforts on other manufacturers\u2019 motorcycles. \u201cThere was a time when there was a waiting list to get a Harley-Davidson,\u201d he said. \u201cNow you can roll up with a scooter and walk out of the dealership with a financing deal on a new bells-and-whistles Harley. It\u2019s almost too easy.\u201d He also said the more well-heeled of his customers were going for older machines than Harley\u2019s gleaming mechanical odes to a bygone era. \u201cI worked on more Honda CBs and other 70s bikes in general this year than any other platform,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve had more high-dollar vintage rebuilds this year than ever before.\u201d Chalk the vintage craze to hipsters, but with the baby boomer wave breaking \u2013 Easy Rider generation motorcyclists are getting too old to ride \u2013 perhaps it\u2019s time for Harley to consider its next move. Accordingly, the company announced this week that it would increase its marketing budget by 65%. It has also begun selling its most basic motorcycles in India. While neither move guarantees success, Harley has been through worse. American Machine and Foundry nearly ruined the company and its reputation in the 1970s (ask any Harley aficionado about the infamous \u201cAMF years\u201d and watch them cringe), but the brand rose from the ashes and once more became a top-seller known for high-quality loud bikes. It remains to be seen whether Harley has enough gas in the tank to pull that trick off one more time.",
