      "bodyText": "Shares in the City suffered their biggest fall in more than four months today as global financial markets were unnerved by a fresh flare-up in Europe's debt crisis and hints that America's central bank is reluctant to pump more cash into the world's biggest economy. Ignoring the upbeat UK economic news, London's benchmark FTSE 100 index took its cue from jittery European bourses and closed 134.57 points lower at 5703.8, a drop of 2.3%. In America, the Dow Jones industrial average closed down 124.80, a fall of just below 0.95%, at 13074.75. Markets had opened lower after the minutes of the US Federal Reserve's policy-making committee appeared to rule out a third bout of quantitative easing, the programme of bond purchases by the central bank that has twice before boosted the American money supply. The mood further darkened on news of a deepening slump in the eurozone's services sector, which was shortly followed by a disappointing bond auction in Spain. Amid growing concerns that the respite from the debt crisis provided over the past four months by the European Central Bank (ECB) is coming to an end, Spanish 10-year bond yields rose by more than 0.25 points to 5.7%, after the government in Madrid struggled to sell new issues of debt. Spain sold \u20ac2.6bn (\u00a32.15bn) of bonds, at the low end of the government's target range and, to placate fears that it might eventually become the fourth eurozone country to require an international bailout, had to offer investors an interest rate of 5.338% on debt maturing in 2020. This was higher than the 5.2% forecast and the 5.156% offered when the debt was last sold in September 2011. Spanish economy minister Luis de Guindos admitted on Wednesday that the biggest risk facing the country was the belief that Madrid would not be able to bring down its budget deficit. In an interview with Reuters, de Guindos said Madrid was determined to reduce the budget deficit to 5.3% of national output in 2012 and to the European Union ceiling of 3% in 2013. \"The main negative effect, the main risk for the Spanish economy, is the perception that public accounts are not sustainable \u2026 the 5.3% commitment is very important but the 3% commitment is very, very important,\" he said. The ECB kept its key interest rate unchanged at 1% on Wednesday, with the bank's president, Mario Draghi, publicly resisting German pressure to begin preparing an exit strategy from the emergency funding operations that have been used to support Europe's banks. Since the late autumn, the ECB has announced two long-term refinancing operations in an attempt to provide cheap credit for banks struggling to obtain credit, but the president of the German Bundesbank, Jens Weidmann, has expressed concerns that the \"wall of money\" released by Draghi will lead to higher inflation. After a survey showed the eurozone's services sector moving deeper into recession last month, Draghi said: \"Given the present conditions of output and unemployment, which is at a historical high, any exit strategy, talking for the time being, is premature.\" He added bluntly: \"I think the president of the ECB is the one who has the last word on this.\" Draghi said the bank had not discussed changing interest rates, although some analysts believe a double-dip recession in the eurozone will lead to lower borrowing costs later this year. Draghi also sought to reassure the Bundesbank that the ECB was not going soft on inflation. \"All our non-standard policy measures are temporary in nature,\" he told the regular post-meeting news conference. \"All the necessary tools are available to address upside risks to medium-term price stability in a firm and timely manner.\" This rise showed financial markets expected governments on the eurozone periphery to deliver reforms, Draghi said, putting pressure on those countries to shape up rather than looking to the ECB to act further. \"Markets are asking these governments to deliver,\" he said. Following the falls in Europe, shares on Wall Street were down by 1% in morning trading, while the price of crude oil fell to $124 a barrel. The eurozone economy shrank 0.3% in the fourth quarter and indicators for future growth remained weak, raising the likelihood that the economy shrank again in the first quarter. Unemployment is at a record 10.8% for the 17 eurozone countries, while youth unemployment has reached unprecedented levels of 50% in Spain and Greece. Annual inflation of 2.6% remains stubbornly above its 2% target. The ECB blames higher oil prices rather than inflationary pressures from the economy.",

      "bodyText": "Tesco has ditched its blue-and-white striped Value label in favour of a new softer brand, as it tries to relieve consumers of the embarrassment of buying the cheapest products on its shelves. Rivals Asda and Sainsbury's have already given their \"no frills\" ranges a makeover and report strong growth as shoppers seek out bargains. The supermarket own-label budget market is growing at more than 9% a year, according to Kantar Worldpanel, with Tesco Value achieving annual sales of \u00a31bn. Launched in the depths of the early 1990s recession, the Value brand was Tesco's answer to the baked bean price war triggered by the now defunct Kwik Save, which was selling 3p cans of beans and 7p loaves of bread. Tesco UK's marketing director, David Wood, said:\"Tesco was the first supermarket to launch a Value range back in 1993, the blue-and-white striped brand giving customers a down-to-earth option. Almost 20 years on, affordable quality is more relevant than ever, but customer needs have changed. Everyday Value will provide products that taste better, look better and are healthier.\" The new label looks more upmarket, with colourful packaging featuring 1950s-style line drawings of kitchen equipment and food. Tesco has revamped some of the 550 products in the range, taking out MSG and hydrogenated fats, and promises they will taste better with the lemon curd \"more lemony\" and 33% more apple in the apple sauce. Tesco's chief executive, Philip Clarke, is trying to reinvigorate its UK business, which has been losing ground to rivals for several years. Kantar retail analyst Bryan Roberts said the brand \"was long overdue a facelift\" but the revamp was not \"bursting with originality\" as it was similar to both Morrisons' M Saver brand and Waitrose Essentials.",

      "body": "<p>Tesco has ditched its blue-and-white striped Value label in favour of a new softer brand, as it tries to relieve consumers of the embarrassment of buying the cheapest products on its shelves.</p> <p>Rivals Asda and Sainsbury's have already given their \"no frills\" ranges a makeover and report strong growth as shoppers seek out bargains. The supermarket own-label budget market is growing at more than 9% a year, according to Kantar Worldpanel, with Tesco Value achieving annual sales of \u00a31bn.</p> <p>Launched in the depths of the early 1990s recession, the Value brand was Tesco's answer to the baked bean price war triggered by the now defunct Kwik Save, which was selling 3p cans of beans and 7p loaves of bread.</p> <p>Tesco UK's marketing director, David Wood, said:\"Tesco was the first supermarket to launch a Value range back in 1993, the blue-and-white striped brand giving customers a down-to-earth option. Almost 20 years on, affordable quality is more relevant than ever, but customer needs have changed. Everyday Value will provide products that taste better, look better and are healthier.\"</p> <p>The new label looks more upmarket, with colourful packaging featuring 1950s-style line drawings of kitchen equipment and food. Tesco has revamped some of the 550 products in the range, taking out MSG and hydrogenated fats, and promises they will taste better with the lemon curd \"more lemony\" and 33% more apple in the apple sauce.</p> <p>Tesco's chief executive, Philip Clarke, is trying to reinvigorate its UK business, which has been losing ground to rivals for several years.</p> <p>Kantar retail analyst Bryan Roberts said the brand \"was long overdue a facelift\" but the revamp was not \"bursting with originality\" as it was similar to both Morrisons' M Saver brand and Waitrose Essentials.</p>",

But perhaps there is some - albeit short and sharp - economic upside after all. It appears the rush to the petrol pumps by panicked motorists has delivered a big boost to consumer spending. UK spending rose 0.4% in March on the month and 0.3 percentage points of that increase was as a result of spending at petrol pumps, according to the latest Visa Europe UK Expenditure Index compiled with data specialists Markit. Steve Perry, commercial director at Visa Europe commented: \"Last week's petrol panic had a tangible impact on overall consumer spending in March as drivers sought to stockpile fuel ...

It is a rare occurrence when one consumer trend has such a sizeable effect on overall spending and it highlights the scale of the spending that took place in the last few days of the month.\" But before anyone gets too excited, even with the petrol panic, the underlying trend in consumer spending remains subdued. Economists will also be quick to point out that last week's fuel rush is unlikely to have constituted a net boost to overall spending given it was simply people moving the timing of a purchase they would probably eventually make anyway. Also, any extra money spent on fuel took away from household budgets for spending on other items. The Visa Europe index, based on card transactions that account for \u00a31 in \u00a33 of all UK spending, still shows spending fell 1.7% in annual terms in March. The three-month on three-month trend improved, but remained negative at -0.4% compared with -1.2% in February.

No one has been charged with an offence.</p> <p>Hope, who was at his flat in east London's Docklands with friends and family, refused to comment on the reports of his arrest. \"I can't talk,\" he said. \"I've got no comment whatsoever, to be honest with you ... I don't want to comment on anything.\"</p> <p>Hope, who claims a typical working day for him stretches from 7am until midnight, generated much publicity last month after reputedly spending more than \u00a3200,000 on Britain's most expensive round of drinks at a Liverpool nightclub. He is said to have spent \u00a3125,000 on a 99lb double Nebuchadnezzar bottle of Armand de Brignac champagne as well as further bottles of champagne and vodka.</p> <p>In the same week, Hope financed the inaugural Fast Growth Entrepreneurs Club networking event at the Westbury Gallery in Mayfair, London. The London Stock Exchange authorised the use of its name as a sponsor of the event, attended by about 60 entrepreneurs and investors, but is understood not to have provided funding.</p> <p>In a video interview at the event, featured on Hope's blog, he said: \"How I got started in foreign exchange markets was I read a book called Profiting with Forex and also another book How to Get Started in Currency Trading \u2013 this was the age of 19 on my journey to work for my old job.\"</p> <p>Hope said he studied sports science at university and was barred from switching to economics because he did not have an A-level in maths. Undeterred, he taught himself. \"In two to three months, I managed to teach myself what I would have learnt from a three-year course,\" he said.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RyMEefFzHH8&amp;feature=youtu.be\" title=\"\">Hope has created his own YouTube showreel</a> in which he says: \"You don't see a lot of people my age in the City doing what I do. And I feel I have got a lot of good opinions of the markets which you don't hear from people my age.\"</p> <p>He featured prominently in a sponsored supplement about spread-betting in the Daily Telegraph last May. \"Who would have thought I would become a trader in the City? Certainly not me,\" he told the paper. \"In a year or two, I'd like to set up my own mini hedge fund.\"</p> <p>Hope said that before discovering his interest in currency trading, he earned \u00a321,000 a year working in catering management at Wembley stadium. He claims to have briefly worked \"as an FX and commodity trader\" for the Forex Academy, a Slough-based website that provides courses in currency trading. Last year, he said he had taught \"nearly 100\" of his friends the elements of currency trading.</p> <p>Several companies have been aggressively advertising foreign exchange trading books and courses in recent years, making bold claims about the opportunities on offer in some of the most high-risk financial markets. Offering tuition for a fee, rather than managing other peoples money, is not an activity regulated by the FSA.</p> <p>On Tuesday, regulators and City of London police officers searched an address in east London \"in connection with an investigation into a suspected unauthorised foreign exchange trading scheme.\"</p> <p>Hope last year set up a company called Short Sterling Limited. He and the company's registrars, Caterham-based AML Benson, are the only directors and no accounts have been filed. He gives his address as a block of flats close to the ExCel Centre by Victoria Dock in east London. According to Land Registry filings, he is not the owner of the lease on that flat.</p> <p>There is only one Alexander Hope on the FSA's authorised persons register \u2013 a 48-year-old independent financial adviser in Gloucester, with no connection to the Hope believed to be at the centre of the FSA's inquiries.</p> <p>It is not illegal to deal on the foreign exchange markets without FSA authorisation.

Alex Hope, formerly a Wembley stadium catering manager, has sought considerable publicity, setting up his own website \u2013 alexhopefx.com \u2013 and making a number of media appearances. The Financial Services Authority (FSA) said a 23-year-old had been arrested on suspicion of committing offences under the FSA Markets Act 2000 and the Fraud Act 2006. No one has been charged with an offence. Hope, who was at his flat in east London's Docklands with friends and family, refused to comment on the reports of his arrest. \"I can't talk,\" he said. \"I've got no comment whatsoever, to be honest with you ... I don't want to comment on anything.\" Hope, who claims a typical working day for him stretches from 7am until midnight, generated much publicity last month after reputedly spending more than \u00a3200,000 on Britain's most expensive round of drinks at a Liverpool nightclub. He is said to have spent \u00a3125,000 on a 99lb double Nebuchadnezzar bottle of Armand de Brignac champagne as well as further bottles of champagne and vodka. In the same week, Hope financed the inaugural Fast Growth Entrepreneurs Club networking event at the Westbury Gallery in Mayfair, London. The London Stock Exchange authorised the use of its name as a sponsor of the event, attended by about 60 entrepreneurs and investors, but is understood not to have provided funding. In a video interview at the event, featured on Hope's blog, he said: \"How I got started in foreign exchange markets was I read a book called Profiting with Forex and also another book How to Get Started in Currency Trading \u2013 this was the age of 19 on my journey to work for my old job.\" Hope said he studied sports science at university and was barred from switching to economics because he did not have an A-level in maths. Undeterred, he taught himself. \"In two to three months, I managed to teach myself what I would have learnt from a three-year course,\" he said. Hope has created his own YouTube showreel in which he says: \"You don't see a lot of people my age in the City doing what I do. And I feel I have got a lot of good opinions of the markets which you don't hear from people my age.\" He featured prominently in a sponsored supplement about spread-betting in the Daily Telegraph last May. \"Who would have thought I would become a trader in the City? Certainly not me,\" he told the paper. \"In a year or two, I'd like to set up my own mini hedge fund.\" Hope said that before discovering his interest in currency trading, he earned \u00a321,000 a year working in catering management at Wembley stadium. He claims to have briefly worked \"as an FX and commodity trader\" for the Forex Academy, a Slough-based website that provides courses in currency trading. Last year, he said he had taught \"nearly 100\" of his friends the elements of currency trading. Several companies have been aggressively advertising foreign exchange trading books and courses in recent years, making bold claims about the opportunities on offer in some of the most high-risk financial markets. Offering tuition for a fee, rather than managing other peoples money, is not an activity regulated by the FSA. On Tuesday, regulators and City of London police officers searched an address in east London \"in connection with an investigation into a suspected unauthorised foreign exchange trading scheme.\" Hope last year set up a company called Short Sterling Limited. He and the company's registrars, Caterham-based AML Benson, are the only directors and no accounts have been filed. He gives his address as a block of flats close to the ExCel Centre by Victoria Dock in east London. According to Land Registry filings, he is not the owner of the lease on that flat. There is only one Alexander Hope on the FSA's authorised persons register \u2013 a 48-year-old independent financial adviser in Gloucester, with no connection to the Hope believed to be at the centre of the FSA's inquiries. It is not illegal to deal on the foreign exchange markets without FSA authorisation. However, there are circumstances where traders investing other people's funds are required to be registered with and overseen by the regulator. In a recent interview, Hope said: \"I use my own money not other people's.\" Asked for his top tip for investors hoping to make the most out of currency trading, he said: \"Sell the euro and buy safe haven currencies (US dollar, Japanese yen, Swiss franc).\" \u2022 This article was amended on 19 April 2012 to remove an incorrect reference which suggested that Joe Hart was a guest of Alex Hope.",

      "bodyText": "A spring revival for British businesses has bolstered hopes that the economy is picking up and overcoming the troubles engulfing the eurozone. The latest in a clutch of business surveys to beat expectations indicated that the UK's dominant services sector, which includes hairdressers, banks and transport, enjoyed a jump in activity in March. The resurgence came as new business growth improved and prompted companies to take on staff, according to the latest Markit/Cips UK Services PMI. The survey followed similar reports from the smaller construction and manufacturing sectors this week that have helped cement the view that Britain will avoid recession. They contrasted with reports of falling activity across the eurozone, where businesses are suffering from lacklustre demand on the back of the sovereign debt crisis and the threat of recession spreading across the currency area. In Britain, the upbeat figures prompted forecasters to suggest economic growth may have rebounded strongly to as much as 0.5% in the first quarter, undoing the 0.3% drop in GDP at the end of last year. \"Faster growth of services activity in March indicates that the economy is on the up again, skirting recession as business continues to bounce back from the lull seen late last year,\" said Chris Williamson, chief economist at survey compilers Markit. The main indicator on the closely watched report rose to 55.3 from 53.8 in February. That was well above the 50-mark dividing contraction from expansion and higher than economists' forecasts of 53.4. Economists said the latest crop of stronger than expected data suggested that the Bank of England would delay making any changes to policy when it makes its latest announcementon Thursday. However, risks remain from high oil prices, the government's austerity drive and the eurozone debt crisis in the coming months, economists said. Bank governor Mervyn King has also warned that the extra bank holidays for the Queen's jubilee in June could hurt economic output in the second quarter. But the services report showed business confidence remains fragile. \"This is no runaway recovery. Job creation and inflows of new business continue to run well below rates generally seen in the years before the financial crisis,\" said Williamson. The recent recovery in UK activity contrasted with continued weakness in the eurozone. Services businesses there suffered their second month of falling activity, according to Markit's PMI data. That followed a drop in activity among manufacturers reported earlier this week. After the single currency union's economy shrank at the end of last year, economists warn it will have failed to bounce back in the first quarter of 2012. \"It is highly likely that the eurozone suffered further modest contraction in the first quarter of 2012 which will put it back into recession,\" said Howard Archer, economist at IHS Global Insight. \"The region is still facing major headwinds, notably including increased fiscal tightening in many countries, markedly rising unemployment overall, and increased oil prices. And while eurozone sovereign debt tensions have been eased by the European Central Bank's actions and a second bailout for Greece, the problems are far from resolved.\" In the US the picture from this week's crop of business surveys was more mixed. The manufacturing sector managed to outstrip expectations, but service sector growth slowed more than expected from February's one-year high, according to the Institute for Supply Management. Emerging markets also continue to enjoy the kind of growth that has been eluding much of the eurozone, with the latest round of PMI surveys from China, India and Brazil all showing expansion in March.",

      "body": "<p>As markets headed south for the second day running and the FTSE 100 turned in its worst daily performance in more than four months, <strong>Next </strong>was one of the day's major fallers following a \u00a33.8m share sale by its chief executive.</p> <p>On Tuesday, the same day Lord Wolfson unveiled the shortlist for his economics prize, he was also authorising the sale of 125,000 shares at \u00a330.57. Other investors decided to follow suit, and Next shares lost 123p to \u00a329.37. Simon Irwin at Liberum Capital said:</p> <blockquote> Simon Wolfson...doesn't appear to sell shares very often. According to Bloomberg the last two occasions were just before the shares peaked in 2007 and in 2004. It goes along with the rather more cautious approach taken by the company of late, particularly when they effectively cut the guidance on current year buybacks from \u00a3200m to \u00a3140m-\u00a3200m. Wolfson is publicly very bearish on the euro and the damage that it can do to the UK, but he has read the macro extremely well in the past and he has also traded his own shares equally well. Although the shares have lagged the sector year to date and over the past 6 months, we think there are macro risks for the UK retailers and company specific for Next's margins which are not discounted and would be strongly tempted to follow Wolfson's lead and sell. </blockquote> <p>There was little cheer elsewhere.

      "bodyText": "As markets headed south for the second day running and the FTSE 100 turned in its worst daily performance in more than four months, Next was one of the day's major fallers following a \u00a33.8m share sale by its chief executive. On Tuesday, the same day Lord Wolfson unveiled the shortlist for his economics prize, he was also authorising the sale of 125,000 shares at \u00a330.57. Other investors decided to follow suit, and Next shares lost 123p to \u00a329.37. Simon Irwin at Liberum Capital said: Simon Wolfson...doesn't appear to sell shares very often. According to Bloomberg the last two occasions were just before the shares peaked in 2007 and in 2004. It goes along with the rather more cautious approach taken by the company of late, particularly when they effectively cut the guidance on current year buybacks from \u00a3200m to \u00a3140m-\u00a3200m. Wolfson is publicly very bearish on the euro and the damage that it can do to the UK, but he has read the macro extremely well in the past and he has also traded his own shares equally well. Although the shares have lagged the sector year to date and over the past 6 months, we think there are macro risks for the UK retailers and company specific for Next's margins which are not discounted and would be strongly tempted to follow Wolfson's lead and sell. There was little cheer elsewhere. The market was under pressure from the start following overnight hints from the US Federal Reserve that it may not be planning further measures to stimulate the country's economy. But the falls really accelerated following a poorly received Spanish bond auction, which only went to emphasise its current financial stress. A monthly US service sector survey proved a slight disappointment, and even better than expected American jobs figures - an ADP report showed a 209,000 rise in March compared to a 206,000 forecast - failed to halt the slide. So the FTSE 100 finished 134.57 points lower at 5703.77, its worst daily performance since 21 November last year and its lowest level since 31 January. Mining and banking shares - the usual victims when investors shy away from risk - lost ground. Fresnillo, the Mexican precious metals miner, fell 138p to \u00a315.33 as silver and gold prices dropped. But that did not stop some takeover speculation in the sector, with talk that Rio Tinto, Glencore and possibly a Chinese company may be looking at First Quantum Minerals, down 39p at \u00a311.51. Canada's First Quantum recently settled a dispute with Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation over a disputed project in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Among the banks, Barclays lost 11.85p to 218.5p and Royal Bank of Scotland fell 0.79p to 26.1p. Shares in pharmaceuticals group Shire bucked the trend for much of the day before finally capitulating to the sell-off. The company has seen a number of setbacks in the past few weeks, including a failed clinical study relating to its Lialda treatment and the withdrawal of a regulatory application for its drug for Fabry disease. Its shares ended 5p lower at \u00a320.25 despite Morgan Stanley repeating its overweight rating (although the bank cut its target price from \u00a325.80 to \u00a324.30). Analyst Peter Verdult said: We continue to believe Shire is one of the best positioned companies across pharma, underpinned by its exposure to the fast growing therapeutic categories of ADHD, orphan drugs and diabetes. Despite recent disappointments, we still forecast a 2012-15 earnings per share compound annual growth rate of 17%, with our 2015 forecast 14% ahead of consensus.

Efforts to strengthen the pipeline continue and we note Shire's financial strength: net debt below $0.5bn with free cash flow of more than $1.0bn per annum. Elsewhere International Power edged 0.8p lower to 402.2p after the company rejected a takeover bid by its majority owner GDF Suez. France's GDF made an offer last week to buy the remaining 30% of International Power it does not already own. It said it would pay 390p a share in cash, valuing its target at \u00a319.9bn. But this was only marginally above the market price and the City and investors labelled the offer as too stingy.

      "bodyText": "It hardly comes as a massive shock that flows of aid were down last year. No western country has been left unscathed by the downturn of the past five years and that financial pressure is reflected in the development assistance figures released by the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Cuts to aid budgets in Spain and Greece - two countries where the belt-tightening has been severe - were of the order of 40%, but countries that have weathered the storm more easily were also less generous last year. Austria cut its aid budget by more than 14%, France by 5.6% and there was even a small reduction of 0.8% in UK financial assistance. The big picture was that aid flows fell by $3.4bn (\u00a32.14bn) in real (inflation-adjusted terms) to $133bn in 2011. According to Oxfam, once exceptional factors such as the timing of debt relief are stripped out, it was the first fall in development assistance since 1997. What do the figures tell us? In terms of the UK, not all that much. The government is still on course to hit its target of increasing aid to 0.7% of national income by 2013: the intention was always to have a big jump in assistance between 2012 and 2013. Globally, however, the OECD data does suggest that the golden era for aid is now over, for the time being at least. Pledges made at Gleneagles in 2005, when the economic outlook was benign and western countries were flush - have not been met. The financial climate is now a lot more hostile, and politicians in rich countries are finding it hard to justify spending more on poor people in poor countries when they are cutting spending on poor people at home. Apart from the budgetary pressures, there are a number of reasons why western donors are making less of an effort than they were in the middle of the last decade. One is the sense that parts of the developing world are doing fine and therefore don't need the help they once did. This is a pretty shallow argument, since what applies to China does not apply to the poorer countries of sub-Saharan Africa, which have enormous physical and human infrastructure needs. A second reason is that there is no individual or government in the west that is pushing the aid agenda in the way that Gordon Brown and Tony Blair once did. Finally, it has to be said that the fizz has gone out of the anti-poverty campaign groups. They were making a big fuss today when the OECD aid figures came out, but need to have a look at their own performance, which in recent years has been distinctly lacklustre. Even in the good years, politicians had to be pushed into action, and this was nearly always the result of public demands for change orchestrated by development groups. Until the spirit and the energy that led to Jubilee 2000 and Make Poverty History is rekindled, western politicians will be able to get away with breaking their promises.",

In Kim, a public health professor who is now president of Dartmouth University and previously led the World Health Organization's HIV/AIDS department, the United States has put forward a good candidate. But the candidate's nationality, and the nominating country \u2013 whether small and poor or large and rich \u2013 should play no role in determining who gets the job.</p> <p>The World Bank's 11 executive directors from emerging and developing countries have put forward two excellent candidates, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/theobserver/2012/apr/01/profile-ngozi-okonjo-iweala?CMP=twt_gu\" title=\"\">Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala of Nigeria</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/poverty-matters/2012/apr/02/world-bank-ocampo-president\" title=\"\">Jos\u00e9 Antonio Ocampo</a> of Colombia. I have worked closely with both of them. Both are first-rate, have served as ministers with multiple portfolios, have performed admirably in top positions in multilateral organizations, and have the diplomatic skills and professional competence to do an outstanding job. They understand finance and economics, the bread and butter of the World Bank, and have a network of connections to leverage the Bank's effectiveness.</p> <p>Okonjo-Iweala brings an insider's knowledge of the institution. Ocampo, like Kim, brings the advantages and disadvantages of being an outsider; but Ocampo, a distinguished professor at Columbia University, is thoroughly acquainted with the World Bank. He previously served not only as minister of economics and finance, but also of agriculture \u2013 a critically important qualification, given that the vast majority of the developing countries' poor depend on farming. He also brings impressive environmental credentials, addressing another of the Bank's central concerns.</p> <p>Both Okonjo-Iweala and Ocampo understand the role of international financial institutions in providing global public goods. Throughout their careers, their hearts and minds have been devoted to development, and to fulfilling the World Bank's mission of eliminating poverty. They have set a high bar for any American candidate.</p> <p>Much is at stake. Almost two billion people remain in poverty in the developing world, and, while the World Bank cannot solve the problem on its own, it plays a leading role.

      "bodyText": "Barack Obama's nomination of Jim Yong Kim for the presidency of the World Bank has been well received \u2013 and rightly so, especially given some of the other names that were bandied about. In Kim, a public health professor who is now president of Dartmouth University and previously led the World Health Organization's HIV/AIDS department, the United States has put forward a good candidate. But the candidate's nationality, and the nominating country \u2013 whether small and poor or large and rich \u2013 should play no role in determining who gets the job. The World Bank's 11 executive directors from emerging and developing countries have put forward two excellent candidates, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala of Nigeria and Jos\u00e9 Antonio Ocampo of Colombia. I have worked closely with both of them. Both are first-rate, have served as ministers with multiple portfolios, have performed admirably in top positions in multilateral organizations, and have the diplomatic skills and professional competence to do an outstanding job. They understand finance and economics, the bread and butter of the World Bank, and have a network of connections to leverage the Bank's effectiveness. Okonjo-Iweala brings an insider's knowledge of the institution. Ocampo, like Kim, brings the advantages and disadvantages of being an outsider; but Ocampo, a distinguished professor at Columbia University, is thoroughly acquainted with the World Bank. He previously served not only as minister of economics and finance, but also of agriculture \u2013 a critically important qualification, given that the vast majority of the developing countries' poor depend on farming. He also brings impressive environmental credentials, addressing another of the Bank's central concerns. Both Okonjo-Iweala and Ocampo understand the role of international financial institutions in providing global public goods. Throughout their careers, their hearts and minds have been devoted to development, and to fulfilling the World Bank's mission of eliminating poverty. They have set a high bar for any American candidate. Much is at stake. Almost two billion people remain in poverty in the developing world, and, while the World Bank cannot solve the problem on its own, it plays a leading role. Despite its name, the Bank is primarily an international development institution. Kim's speciality, public health, is critical, and the Bank has long supported innovative initiatives in this field. But health is only a small part of the Bank's \"portfolio,\" and it typically works in this area with partners who bring to the table expertise in medicine. Rumours suggest that the US is likely to insist on maintaining the perverse selection process in which it gets to pick the World Bank's president, simply because, in this election year, Obama's opponents would trumpet loss of control over the choice as a sign of weakness. And it is more important for the US to retain that control than it is for emerging and developing countries to obtain it. Indeed, the more powerful of the emerging markets know how to live within the current system, and they may use it to their advantage. They will, in effect, obtain an IOU, to be cashed in for something that is more important. The realpolitik of the moment makes fighting over the presidency unlikely; America may well prevail. But at what cost? Should America continue to insist on controlling the selection process, it is the Bank itself that would suffer. For years, the Bank's effectiveness was compromised because it was seen, in part, as a tool of western governments and their countries' financial and corporate sectors. Ironically, even America's long-term interests would be best served by a commitment \u2013 not just in words, but also in deeds \u2013 to a merit-based system and good governance. One supposed achievement of the G20 was an agreement to reform the governance of the international financial institutions \u2013 most importantly, how their leaders are selected. Since expertise on development by and large lies within the emerging and developing countries \u2013 after all, they live development \u2013 it seems natural that the World Bank's head would come from one of those countries. To maintain a cabal among developed countries, whereby the US appoints the World Bank president and Europe picks the International Monetary Fund's head, seems particularly anachronistic and perplexing today, when the Bank and the Fund are turning to emerging market countries as a source of funds. While the US, the international community, and the Bank itself repeatedly emphasise the importance of good governance, a selection procedure that de facto leaves the appointment to the US president makes a mockery of it. Okonjo-Iweala put the matter forcefully in an interview with the Financial Times: what is at stake is a matter of hypocrisy. The integrity of the advanced industrial countries, which have a majority of the votes at the World Bank, is being put to the test. Copyright: Project Syndicate, 2012.",

Now International Power's independent directors - whose approval GDF needs ahead of an August lock-up arrangement - have agreed. They said:</p> <blockquote> The members of the independent committee have unanimously concluded the indicative proposal....undervalues International Power and accordingly GDF has been notified [we are] unable to accept [it]. <br> Under the terms of the relationship agreement.. GDF and its affiliates are generally restricted from making a takeover offer for [International Power] for the period until 3 August 2012 (or earlier with the consent of all of the independent non-executive directors. </blockquote> <p>GDF has responded that it believed its offer was attractive, and said it would continue to consider its options following the rejection of the proposal.

      "bodyText": "International Power shares have dipped after the company rejected a takeover bid by its majority owner GDF Suez. France's GDF - in one of the least unexpected moves in recent corporate history - made an offer last week to buy the remaining 30% of International Power it does not already own. It said it would pay 390p a share in cash, valuing its target at \u00a319.9bn. But this was only marginally above the market price and the City and investors labelled the offer as too stingy. Now International Power's independent directors - whose approval GDF needs ahead of an August lock-up arrangement - have agreed. They said: The members of the independent committee have unanimously concluded the indicative proposal....undervalues International Power and accordingly GDF has been notified [we are] unable to accept [it]. Under the terms of the relationship agreement.. GDF and its affiliates are generally restricted from making a takeover offer for [International Power] for the period until 3 August 2012 (or earlier with the consent of all of the independent non-executive directors. GDF has responded that it believed its offer was attractive, and said it would continue to consider its options following the rejection of the proposal. This could include withdrawing the offer: Any decision by the group will be based on a strict disciplined and value-driven approach to earnings, indebtedness and returns. In the market International Power's shares are down 0.5p at 402.5p - still well above the offer price - and investors await further developments. Guillaume Redgwell at Liberum Capital said: This is not a major surprise - the shares have been trading above the indicative offer since the original announcement. Overall the market has fallen back once again, with the damage done by news of disappointing Australian exports, mixed service sector surveys and, notably, hints from the US Federal Reserve that it may not implement any further boosts to the economy such as quantitative easing. The FTSE 100 is down 32.09 points at 5806.25, with mining groups among the major fallers. Fresnillo is down 66p at \u00a316.05 and Rio Tinto is 67.5p lower at \u00a334.63. Retailers are under pressure, with Next down 83p at \u00a329.77 as Lord Wolfson - on the same day as he unveiled the shortlist for his economics prize - raised \u00a33.8m by selling 125,000 shares at \u00a330.57.
