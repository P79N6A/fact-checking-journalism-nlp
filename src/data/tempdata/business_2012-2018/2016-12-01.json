      "bodyText": "One of the students who made the life-saving medicine Daraprim in a school laboratory has accused Martin Shkreli of being \u201can attention-seeking businessman\u201d who forgets there are \u201cpeople\u2019s lives and livelihoods at stake\u201d in the row over predatory drug pricing. Former hedge fund manager Shkreli last year bought Turing Pharmaceuticals and almost immediately increased the price of the drug \u2013 which has been off-patent since the 1970s \u2013 from US$13.50 to US$750 a tablet. The drug is used to treat certain types of malaria as well as toxoplasmosis, a rare and life-threatening infection caused by the Toxoplasma parasite which particularly affects people with weakened immune systems, such as those with HIV. To show how exorbitant Shkreli\u2019s pricing of the drug was, a group of year 11 students aged 16 and 17 from Sydney Grammar aimed to recreate the drug molecule in their school laboratory under the guidance of Dr Alice Williamson and Associate Professor Matthew Todd from the Open Source Malaria consortium. They succeeded, making the drug for a mere $2 a pill. The story went global overnight, with headlines such as \u201cHigh schoolers punch Martin Shkreli in the face, figuratively\u201d in Forbes and \u201cSydney high school students \u2018show up\u2019 Martin Shkreli\u201d in the Washington Post. On Twitter Shkreli dismissed what the students achieved, saying \u201chow is that showing anyone up? Almost any drug can be made at small scale for a low price\u201d. One of the students, Leonard Milan, told Guardian Australia that Shkreli \u201csaying to us that anyone could do what we could do is certainly true\u201d. \u201cIf you follow his overpriced method using toxic chemicals in an industrial lab it\u2019s easy,\u201d Leonard said. \u201cBut the fact that we were able to substitute some really toxic gasses with simple school-available chemicals and do it so cheaply demonstrates the absurdity of some of his justifications for the price. \u201cI think Martin is an attention-seeking businessman, the way he responds to every Twitter post made threatening him, bragging about how he can do whatever he wants reflects this. \u201cWhilst there are mitigating factors, namely the percentage of returns he puts back into research and development, I think he has made it a personal matter. If he were to get \u2018pushed around\u2019 by schoolkids, it\u2019d be a bad look. \u201cI feel like Martin can forget that there are people\u2019s lives and livelihoods at stake.\u201d Williamson told Guardian Australia that showing how cheap and easy the drug was to produce was part of the point of the project, as it highlighted how unfair Shkreli\u2019s pricing of the drug was. She refused to weigh into Shkreli\u2019s Twitter tirade, saying only: \u201cI like to let the work speak for itself.\u201d Shkreli later posted a video to Twitter boasting of his own achievements when he was younger. He also reminded Twitter users that \u201cI have patents and stuff\u201d. He later tweeted that \u201clab scale manufacturing\u201d and \u201cmanufacturing costs millions to maintain\u201d. The students were undeterred by Shkreli\u2019s comments, telling Guardian Australia the project had instilled a passion in them for science. \u201cIt has made me want to do a science degree,\u201d James Wood said.",

In April, the company said on Thursday, Schultz will become \u201cexecutive chairman\u201d, and the Kevin Johnson, chief operating officer, will step up to replace him. Shares of the coffee retailer\u2019s stock took a sharp dive on the news in after-hours trading, dropping 3.3% to $56.78. Schultz, who will remain chairman of the board, will devote time to furthering a \u201csocial impact agenda\u201d, he said in a call with investors. His duties will also include developing new technologies for Starbucks stores, like the company\u2019s recent foray into carbonated \u201cnitro\u201d cold brew. In 2000, Schultz left the CEO position after running the company since 1987; in early 2008 he returned to steer it through the financial crisis after the company lost half its value on the stock market over the course of a single year. The coffeehouse chain\u2019s current situation is different from its position eight years ago, Schultz said, because the 2016 management team was better-suited to the challenges of the market than 2008\u2019s senior staff had been. The move is not entirely a surprise. Schultz stepped down from a seat on the board he will now chair in 2013, and rumors about his political aspirations have circulated for some time. A spokeswoman for the company dismissed them. \u201cHoward has long said that we need to stop looking to Washington DC for wisdom and inspiration, and instead look for it in our cities and towns, in businesses and community organizations, and in one another,\u201d she told the Guardian. Schultz \u201chas no plans to run for political office, as he has said many times, and will remain with the company\u201d, she said. In his new position, Schultz will shift focus to \u201cretail innovation\u201d, the company said in a press release.

The company overwhelmingly contributed money to the Clinton campaign \u2013 nearly $65,000 to Trump\u2019s $1,400 in contributions. Schultz wrote a downbeat memo to staff when Trump won the election: \u201c[L]ike so many of our fellow Americans \u2013 both Democrats and Republicans \u2013 I am stunned,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe cannot know what the precise impact will be on our country and the rest of the world,\u201d Schultz wrote, though he said he was \u201chopeful that we will overcome the vitriol and division\u201d of the season.

      "bodyText": "The operator of Southern rail has launched legal action in an attempt to stop industrial action by the drivers of its trains. Aslef, the drivers union, this week announced three days of strikes later this month as well a week-long walkout in the new year. Action by the drivers could cripple services on Britain\u2019s biggest commuter rail franchise, which has been disrupted throughout the year by strikes by conductors. The short-staffed rail franchise would be put under severe pressure even outside the strike dates, with an overtime ban due to start next Tuesday. The train company has admitted that it does not employ a sufficient number of drivers to cover its rosters. Southern\u2019s operator, Govia Thameslink Railway, issued proceedings at the high court on Thursday to seek an injunction to stop Aslef\u2019s industrial action which was was backed overwhelmingly by drivers. GTR previously blocked a proposed strike in 2015 by Aslef, arguing successfully that there were irregularities in the ballot. Aslef suspended the latest ballot on one occasion in an attempt to avoid any further challenge. The train operator has lodged the court application citing its belief that the union\u2019s planned action would breach customers\u2019 rights under EU law. Charles Horton, GTR\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cWe launch legal action reluctantly but now without any other choice. Obviously we would prefer to resolve this directly with Aslef. We asked the union to withdraw the industrial action and to re-enter discussions but they refused to do so, which means that we now have no choice but to go to court. \u201cWe have a responsibility to our customers to do all we can to protect their interests and maintain services for them. Passengers now face the prospect of 40 days of continuous industrial action by Aslef and, on top of months of travel misery they\u2019ve already suffered, it is totally unacceptable. \u201cThe proposed industrial action called by Aslef is unjustified, unnecessary and we believe unlawful. It will severely disrupt all our customers, including the tens of thousands of customers a day who use our services for travelling to and from Gatwick airport.\u201d The dispute, with the RMT\u2019s conductors as well as Aslef, centres on the issue of driver-only operation of trains, which GTR insists is perfectly safe and accepted elsewhere in the rail industry by drivers. However, Mick Whelan, the general secretary of Aslef, said that the union believed the practice was unsafe with growing passenger numbers and longer trains. He said: \u201cDriver-only operation was designed for three-car 317s on the Bedford to St Pancras line in the early 1980s when it was all about managed decline at the fag end of British Rail. \u201cAn increase in the number of passengers we are carrying every day means there are now 1,100 passengers on a 12-car train and a driver will have just two seconds to check 24 sets of doors and that\u2019s simply not adequate to deal safely and properly with the travelling public.\u201d A hearing and decision at the high court is expected in the coming days. Earlier, the RMT announced it would move the date of some of its planned strikes from the days immediately prior to Christmas, instead taking action on 19 and 20 December, in response to passenger feedback. Southern said the move was cynical and designed to cause maximum disruption after Aslef strikes scheduled for 13, 14 and 16 December. The RMT\u2019s conductors on Southern will also be striking from 6-8 December and from 31 December for 72 hours.",

      "bodyText": "The eurozone crisis never went away; it was just overlooked in the Brexit upheaval. But you can rely on Italy to trigger thoughts of catastrophe and, sure enough, the arrival of this weekend\u2019s referendum on constitutional reform has spooked markets. The yield on 10-year Italian debt has doubled from 1% to 2% since August, outpacing the rise in yields on most other eurozone sovereign debt. The euro has even weakened against the supposedly down-and-out pound. A euro cost 90p a month ago but now fetches 84p. In the grand scheme, these are not enormous moves. Back in 2011-12, when the Greek debt crisis was in full swing, Italian 10-year yields hit 7%; and the euro is still 10% stronger against sterling since the UK referendum. But Italian risks \u2013 for the short, medium and long-term \u2013 are real. The immediate danger will arrive if PM Matteo Renzi loses the referendum and then honours his pledge to resign. His departure would make it harder to resolve a crisis in the Italian banking system that should have been addressed half a decade ago and is now intense. It even got a special mention in the Bank of England\u2019s UK financial stability report this week. The detail is extraordinary: bad, or non-performing, loans in Italy exceed the total provision for losses and the banks\u2019 core capital. The only solid cure is a combination of fresh capital and the infliction of financial pain on some classes of bondholders. The latter is politically explosive \u2013 because so many bank bonds are held by pensioners \u2013 but demanded by new eurozone restrictions on state-sponsored bailouts. As for injections of capital, the private sector will not volunteer if the country is without a prime minister for the next two months. The medium-term risk is that the vacuum is filled by the anti-euro Five Star Movement led by comedian Beppe Grillo, currently riding high in the polls in the run-up to a general election that must be held by February 2018. Note, too, that planned electoral changes in Italy will give the largest party extra parliamentary clout in future. The overhaul is intended to prevent so many wobbly coalitions. But if Five Star is the first beneficiary, the eurozone will have a proper political crisis on its hands. The long-term risk remains the same: Italy is stuck in an economic rut. Growth has improved slightly with Renzi\u2019s market-friendly reforms \u2013 0.8% is predicted for this year \u2013 but the Italian economy is still basically sluggish. Meanwhile, public debt is 130% of GDP and unemployment stands at 11.6%, above the eurozone average of 9.8%. The employment rate is just 57.2%; the UK\u2019s is 74.4%. It is too simple to say defeat for Renzi in the referendum will unleash a fresh eurozone crisis because one should never underestimate the power of the European Central Bank to buy time by suppressing bond yields. But the ECB\u2019s powers are not unlimited and the quantitative easing programme cannot continue indefinitely. The Bank of England\u2019s stability report summed up the overall picture: \u201cRisks associated with the euro area remain elevated.\u201d You bet. And the Italian risks look acute. Glencore\u2019s dance with debt has hurt its chief Ivan Glasenberg has hauled Glencore out of its debt hole, a task that looked daunting 18 months ago. Borrowings have been reduced from $30bn to $17.5bn by selling $6bn of assets, cutting expenditure and raising $2.5bn of fresh capital at 125p a share. Glasenberg, the chief executive, dipped into his back pocket to contribute $211m to the fundraising and has made a handsome turn. The share price is now 283p. It has been an impressive act of escapology, with dividends set to resume next year. But Glasenberg\u2019s status as the all-seeing sage of the mining world is surely ruined. Glencore\u2019s dance with debt was absurdly aggressive in an industry where the next big downturn is never far away. The company has recovered through its own efforts but also through good fortune, in the form of a rapid rebound in the prices of copper, coal and zinc. Those commodities will have to keep humming along if Glencore is ever to return to its 2011 flotation price of 530p, which is a truer benchmark for success. Only an 87% improvement in share price to go, then. Asos\u2019s spirit of openness has its limits \u201cWe have nothing to hide and much to be proud of,\u201d declared Nick Beighton, chief executive of online clothing retailer Asos, in October when working conditions in the firm\u2019s warehouse in Barnsley came under the spotlight. The spirit of openness has its limits, however. Beighton initially welcomed our reporter to Asos\u2019s annual shareholder meeting on Thursday but then changed his mind and turfed him out before proceedings started. Note to Beighton: if you want promote the idea that your working conditions are splendid, don\u2019t adopt a bunker mentality.",

But if Five Star is the first beneficiary, the eurozone will have a proper political crisis on its hands.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2016/nov/30/with-its-deal-on-barrel-quotas-opec-is-back-on-the-radar-for-now\">With its deal on barrel quotas, Opec is back on the radar \u2013 for now</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The long-term risk remains the same: Italy is stuck in an economic rut. Growth has improved slightly with Renzi\u2019s market-friendly reforms \u2013 0.8% is predicted for this year \u2013 but the Italian economy is still basically sluggish. Meanwhile, public debt is 130% of GDP and unemployment stands at 11.6%, above the eurozone average of 9.8%. The employment rate is just 57.2%; the UK\u2019s is 74.4%.</p> <p>It is too simple to say defeat for Renzi in the referendum will unleash a fresh eurozone crisis because one should never underestimate the power of the European Central Bank to buy time by suppressing bond yields. But the ECB\u2019s powers are not unlimited and the quantitative easing programme cannot continue indefinitely.</p> <p>The Bank of England\u2019s stability report summed up the overall picture: \u201cRisks associated with the euro area remain elevated.\u201d You bet.

Borrowings have been reduced from $30bn to $17.5bn by selling $6bn of assets, cutting expenditure and raising $2.5bn of fresh capital at 125p a share. Glasenberg, the chief executive, dipped into his back pocket to contribute $211m to the fundraising and has made a handsome turn. The share price is now 283p. It has been an impressive act of escapology, with dividends set to resume next year.</p> <p>But Glasenberg\u2019s status as the all-seeing sage of the mining world is surely ruined. Glencore\u2019s dance with debt was absurdly aggressive in an industry where the next big downturn is never far away. The company has recovered through its own efforts but also through good fortune, in the form of a rapid rebound in the prices of copper, coal and zinc. Those commodities will have to keep humming along if Glencore is ever to return to its 2011 flotation price of 530p, which is a truer benchmark for success. Only an 87% improvement in share price to go, then.</p> <h2>Asos\u2019s spirit of openness has its limits</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1ec0486d600cb86c969a1ae518b458fcec24d892\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1ec0486d600cb86c969a1ae518b458fcec24d892/0_60_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protesters stage a \u2018catwalk of shame\u2019 demonstration outside the Asos headquarters in London about the conditions in the firm\u2019s Barnsley warehouse.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protesters stage a \u2018catwalk of shame\u2019 demonstration outside the Asos headquarters in London about the conditions in the firm\u2019s Barnsley warehouse.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hannah McKay/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe have nothing to hide and much to be proud of,\u201d declared Nick Beighton, chief executive of online clothing retailer Asos, in October when working conditions in the firm\u2019s warehouse in Barnsley came under the spotlight.

The cost of a barrel of Brent crude rose by more than $2 to just over $54 a barrel as the rally that greeted news of an agreement reached by producing nations in Vienna extended into a second day. Sam Wahab, director of oil and gas research at Cantor Fitzgerald Europe, said: \u201cWednesday\u2019s] agreement has truly changed the landscape for oil over the coming years, putting a floor of $50 a barrel under oil prices. \u201cIt means 2017 will likely see prices around the $55-$60 a barrel mark, and we may yet see further jumps in prices as soon as next week if the non-Opec members also agree a production cut at their meeting on Friday 9 December.\u201d Motoring organisations warned the Opec deal could push petrol prices up by 9p a litre, adding an average \u00a35 to the cost of filling a car. Changes in oil prices usually feed through to petrol prices in less than a fortnight. The deal triggered frenetic trading in the futures market. Activity in contracts for February and March 2017 \u2013 when the impact of the January output restrictions will be evident \u2013 hit record levels. Traders pushed prices higher after the biggest non-Opec producer, Russia, said it would also cut output \u2013 its first co-ordinated move with the cartel in 15 years. Azerbaijan, another non-Opec country, has also agreed to take part in a drive to reduce production by 1.8m barrels per day in an attempt to underpin the oil price. BP, whose shares jumped by 2.3% on the back of the rising oil price, announced it was going ahead with a $9bn expansion of its Mad Dog field in the Gulf of Mexico. Opec\u2019s deal was possible because Saudi Arabia abandoned its strategy of flooding the global market with oil in an attempt to drive US shale producers out of business. Despite the two-day rally, Brent crude is trading at less than half its recent peak of $115 a barrel reached in the summer of 2014. Dominic Rossi, of Fidelity International, said the deal may not hold: \u201cI would not get too excited by the Opec cut. Compliance will be a problem, and the Russians will pump more gas instead. In the meantime, the long-run marginal cost of US shale continues to fall. I would not chase this oil price rally too hard.\u201d Jane Sydenham, investment director at Rathbone Investment Management, said: \u201cWhile at present the news is good for the markets, it is much more difficult to say how this will play out in the longer term. \u201cWe\u2019re currently experiencing a knee-jerk reaction, unsurprising since this is the biggest co-ordinated action in eight years. It is likely that this will run on for a little while longer but how the markets price in the unexpected oil inflation is something we are yet to see.\u201d On the currency markets, the pound was up by 6% against the euro, 1.5% against the US dollar, and by 15% against the Japanese yen.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A new \u00a3310m factory in Hull that makes wind turbine blades has been hailed by ministers as proof that manufacturing has a \u201cglittering\u201d future in the UK. The first batch of 75-metre blades have emerged from the plant, part of a vast \u201cgreen port\u201d built by Siemens and partners at docks that used to export Yorkshire coal. The facility, which started operating in September, is due to employ 1,000 by the new year, up from 700. The investment is considered a huge boost for a port area that had declined into a wasteland and a city with one of the UK\u2019s highest unemployment rates. Stephen Brady, the city council\u2019s leader, said the plant, combined with Hull being named city of culture for 2017, was a positive \u201cperfect storm\u201d. \u201cThis place is proof that manufacturing in this country and in this great city has a glittering, hi-tech future,\u201d said the business and energy secretary, Greg Clark, at the site\u2019s inauguration on Thursday. Everything about Alexandra Docks is big, from the 90-metre turbine towers that stand waiting to be floated out in January to a windfarm off the coast of Cromer, Norfolk, to the blade factory itself, which spans an area the size of seven football pitches. Inside its cavernous halls sit the 28-tonne blades under construction, made of balsa wood and fibreglass. Hundreds will be built there each year, destined for bigger, more powerful offshore windfarms in deeper waters up and down the UK\u2019s coast. Surprisingly, the manufacturing process is almost entirely done by hand, rather than robots. The workforce includes former supermarket workers, aerospace industry experts on second careers and builders who learned fibreglass skills locally from fitting bathrooms and making caravan parts. The blades are precisely moulded, finely finished and then painted. \u201cIt\u2019s a million miles away from a supermarket,\u201d said Fiona Wright, 25, who used to work at Asda while studying biomedical science, and now makes the basic structure of the blades atop a mould. Like many of the new employees, she was sent for several weeks to a blade factory in Aalborg, Denmark, for training. \u201cI loved it. It was a great experience,\u201d she said of her trip. Ian Deer, 48, used to work at British Aerospace in nearby Brough, where Harrier jump jets were built. \u201cIt\u2019s a different product but the skills are still the same. It\u2019s all hand skills, reading drawings, reading instructions,\u201d said Deer, a Siemens group leader with expertise in assembly work in metal, wood and fibreglass. He called the new facility \u201cphenomenal\u201d for the city. Siemens said 97% of staff live within a 30-mile radius of the site, in a riposte to complaints in previous years that the UK wind industry was benefiting only foreign workers. \u201cFor all those people that say there is this fear that we have German and Danish people taking away jobs for British people, this has been a perfect example of German and Danish people creating 700 jobs here in the UK,\u201d said Juergen Maier, chief executive of Siemens UK. For the next two to three years, the blades built at the site will be shipped to offshore windfarms around planned or under way in the UK, which has more offshore wind power than any country in the world. But the blades from the Hull facility were originally intended for export too, for burgeoning markets in the Netherlands and Belgium. \u201cWe are not yet looking at exporting but of course as we get more successful and bring the cost down of the technology [we hope we will export],\u201d said Maier. The full order book for UK windfarms will initially insulate the plant from Brexit, but Maier said it was important that that \u201cpunitive\u201d trade tariffs were not imposed as the UK left the EU. \u201cIf there are tariffs, it is not particularly helpful.\u201d Clark echoed those sentiments. \u201cI want this plant to export,\u201d he said. \u201cThe ability to trade without tariffs is very important.\u201d There is also concern in the industry over what happens if the pipeline of British windfarms begins to dry up in coming years. Due to an overspend in recent years for renewable energy subsidies, partly because existing offshore windfarms were more productive than expected, there is little public money left for new projects in the run-up to 2020. Clarity on support into the next decade was due in the autumn statement, but to the disappointment of many it was bumped to the 2017 budget. However, Clark said investors should be reassured by the government\u2019s actions since he was appointed in July, and what he called the administration\u2019s \u201czeal\u201d for clean energy. \u201cThere\u2019s no disguising, no ambiguity whatever, about the centrality of clean energy that we see not just to our commitments on climate change, vital though they are, and the energy sector, but to industry more generally,\u201d he said.",

    "webTitle": "Oil price hits one-year high, as 'soft Brexit' hopes boost sterling \u2013 as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Right, that\u2019s all for today. A quick recap. December has got off to a lively start in the financial markets, with big moves in the commodity and foreign exchange arenas. Traders have driven the oil price sharply higher for the second day running. Brent crude has hit its highest level since October 2015, jumping by almost 5% to $54.31 per barrel. Despite questions over compliance, yesterday\u2019s Opec deal is being seen as a real game-changer that could push prices higher - meaning fresh inflationary pressures and higher prices at the petrol pumps. The pound has also romped higher today, after Brexit minister David Davis offered the tantalising prospect of the UK paying to access the EU single market. The comments, made in parliament, fuelled hopes that Britain might avoid a \u2018hard Brexit\u2019. Sterling hit two-month highs, before dipping a little -- and is currently up 0.5% at $1.257. Government bonds have also sold off today, driving up the yield on benchmark US debt. UK borrowing costs also rose, with the yield on 10-year gilts up from 1.5% to 1.51%. And European stock markets have closed in the red: FTSE 100: down 30 points at 6752, -0.45% German DAX: down 106 points at 10534, -1% French CAC: down 17 points at 4560, -0.4% Investors are fretting about Sunday\u2019s Italian referendum on constitutional reforms, and Austria\u2019s presidential election (between a far-right candidate and a Green). Get swotting up now! Over on Wall Street, machine and equipment firm Caterpillar briefly suspended its shares today so it could warn that analysts profit expectations are \u2018too optimistic\u2019. Caterpillar cited various headwinds, such as Brexit uncertainty, Europe\u2019s slow recovery and volatility in the oil price. It also warned that any infrastructure programme from Donald Trump probably wouldn\u2019t help its earnings in 2017. This is the key slide from its presentation to analysts: Caterpillar\u2019s share price has been rising for weeks, on speculation that Trump\u2019s plans to upgrade America\u2019s highways, airports and schools will mean more demand for its diggers and trucks. But Wall Street isn\u2019t too worried by today\u2019s warning; Caterpillar\u2019s shares have resumed trading, up 0.25% on the day. Now this is interesting....oil giant BP has signed off on a $9bn project to expand its Mad Dog oil field in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. The decision follows extensive work bringing the cost of the project down (at one stage, it was going to cost $20bn). And it shows that oil firms are prepared to invest in new projects, if they think the oil price makes it worthwhile. BP chief executive Bob Dudley says: \u201cThis announcement shows that big deepwater projects can still be economic in a low price environment in the US if they are designed in a smart and cost-effective way. \u201cIt also demonstrates the resilience of our strategy which is focused on building on incumbent positions in the world\u2019s most prolific hydrocarbon basins while relentlessly focusing on value over volume.\u201d But.... BP can never shake off memories of an earlier project in the Gulf, the Deepwater Horizon disaster at the Macondo oil field in 2010. Eleven workers were killed when the rig caught fire, creating one of the worst environmental disasters ever. Central Bank news! Agustin Carstens, head of the Bank of Mexico, has resigned. Carstens, one of the world\u2019s most experienced central bankers, has been appointed to run the Bank of International Settlements (BIS is basically the central bankers\u2019 central bank). He will leave the Bank of Mexico in July 2017, and start at BIS three months later. Carstens deserves a change of job, having been battling to handle the impact of Donald Trump\u2019s pronouncements on the Mexican Peso. Bloomberg\u2019s Michael McDonough says the news adds extra uncertainty, with Mexico already expected to hike interest rates next month: The top rung of central banking is a little like Formula 1 -- with a small number of candidates moving between a limited number of seats. So Carstens\u2019 appointment may have a knock-on effect on the European Central Bank; board member Beno\u00eet C\u0153ur\u00e9 could possible have got the BIS job, but is now free for other challenges... Boom! The Brent crude oil price has just hit its highest level of the year. A barrel of Brent for February delivery just changed hands at $53.79, which is the most expensive since October 2015. Opec\u2019s surprise supply cut is forcing traders to rapidly reassess their expectations. Jane Sydenham, investment director at Rathbone Investment Management, calls it a \u2018knee jerk\u2019 reaction to yesterday\u2019s deal: \u201cWhilst at present the news is good for the markets, it is much more difficult to say how this will play out in the longer term. We\u2019re currently experiencing a knee-jerk reaction, unsurprising since this is the biggest co-ordinated action in eight years. It is likely that this will run on for a little while longer but how the markets price in the unexpected oil inflation is something we are yet to see.\u201d Former cabinet minister Iain Duncan Smith, who campaigned for Brexit, has criticised the idea that Britain might make payments to the EU after leaving the bloc. He was responding to David Davis\u2019s suggestion that the UK would consider the idea. PA has the story: Prominent Brexit-backer Iain Duncan Smith claimed Mr Davis had given a \u201cconvoluted\u201d answer and may have been talking about \u201cbridging arrangements\u201d to phase out UK contributions to the EU. The former cabinet minister insisted there was no way of reaching a deal to pay the EU for access to the single market. He told BBC Radio 4\u2019s The World At One: \u201cMy sense is that I don\u2019t think that he was absolutely answering the question that was posed to him. \u201cWhat he\u2019s talking about here is how do you get a deal that allows British and Europeans to access each others\u2019 markets without the necessity of tariff barriers or artificial barriers against service etc. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any way in which you can reach a deal whereby you say \u2018I\u2019ll pay some money in and therefore you allow us access\u2019, because you might as well have tariff barriers at that point.\u201d Other Brexit supporters have also expressed disquiet about this idea in the past; but it all depends on the kind of Brexit deal that Theresa May goes for. Today\u2019s pound rally follows the currency\u2019s best month since 2009. Sterling gained 6% against the euro in November, 1,5% against the US dollar, and almost 15% against the Japanese yen. It may show that the markets are becoming less worried about the UK, following more solid economic data since June\u2019s Brexit vote. Kathleen Brooks of City Index says: Momentum is particularly strong against the yen and its recent performance has been staggering, GBPJPY is up more than 14% since the start of November! Political risks around Brexit are receding, as political risks elsewhere start to bite. The cost to insure UK sovereign debt has fallen sharply since spiking back in June. Good economic news from America: its factory sector is growing at its fastest pace since the Brexit vote. The ISM manufacturing index has jumped to 53.2 in November, from 51.9 in October, which is the fastest rate since June. Firm said they were benefitting from strong domestic demand. A rival survey, from Markit, was also just released. It\u2019s even more encouraging, showing activity rising at a 13-month high. No wonder City traders may be looking frazzled: The US crude oil price has hit a five-week high, as traders push it through the$50 per barrel mark. Oil is surging even higher, as commodity traders continue to react to the Opec supply cut deal hammered out yesterday. Brent crude is now up 3% at $53.44 per barrel, a near two-month high, and a really substantial surge from $46/barrel before the Opec meeting. Opec\u2019s decision to cut output by 1.2m barrels per day looks like a real game-changer. The group\u2019s secretary general, Mohammed Barkindo, is telling Bloomberg TV right now that it was a \u201chistoric landmark\u201d Sam Wahab, director of oil and gas research at Cantor Fitzgerald Europe, believes the price could keep rising: \u201cYesterday\u2019s agreement has truly changed the landscape for oil over the coming years, putting a floor of $50 a barrel under oil prices. \u201cPrior to this agreement, the environment of sub $50 oil was likely to persist, but this move sufficiently addresses the supply/demand dynamics, with some 3.5% of supply being cut from January. \u201cIt means 2017 will likely see prices around the $55-$60 a barrel mark, and we may yet see further jumps in prices as soon as next week if the non-OPEC members also agree a production cut at their meeting on Friday 9th December. Today\u2019s rally has pushed the pound to nearly a three-month high against the euro. That means it\u2019s just 8% below its pre-referendum levels (having been down 15% at one stage). The pound just spiked even higher against the US dollar, after the latest American unemployment figures hit the wires. Sterling hit $1.268, up 1.7 cents, as data showed that the number of Americans filing new claims for jobless benefit has hit a 5-month high. The initial jobless claims figure rose to 268,000 last week, up from 251,000. Here\u2019s some more reaction to David Davis\u2019s comments, and the bounce in the pound: Craig Erlam, chief market analyst with retail brokerage Oanda: \u201cThe idea that single market is still a priority is a move away from the \u2018hard Brexit\u2019 line. Since the two or three major selloffs we saw earlier this year, the Bank of England has changed its stance to holding rates next year, the data has been better and now the rhetoric has softened.\u201d Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital: \u201cSterling is on the tear this morning on hopes for a soft Brexit. \u201cDavid Davis said the UK could contribute to the EU budget in return for access to markets and that has fuelled a rally for the pound.\u201d Chris Saint, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown Currency Service \u201cSterling\u2019s rehabilitation is gathering steam, having broken through the \u20ac1.19 level against the euro today for the first time in almost three months. A surge of nearly 1% versus the US dollar has also lifted the pound back above US$1.26. Gains come amid signs of a more compromising approach to upcoming Brexit negotiations from the UK government, with Brexit minister David Davis saying Britain would consider contributing to the EU budget in return for retaining access to European markets. Our Politics Live blog has full coverage of David Davis\u2019s comments on Brexit: David Davis\u2019s suggestion that the UK could pay for access to European markets after Brexit have also sent the pound rallying against the euro. Sterling has gained nearly one eurocent to \u20ac1.19, its highest point since September 7th. Caxton FX analyst Alexandra Russell-Oliver says that Davis\u2019s comments are pushing the pound up. She also points out that the euro is suffering from fears of political instability, with two important votes taking place on Sunday: The pound rally, which has occurred against most major currencies has follows comments from Brexit Secretary Davis, which indicate that the UK may be willing to make trade-offs for access to the single market. The euro is currently under pressure in anticipation of the Italian Constitutional Referendum and Austrian Presidential Election, taking place on Sunday, where shock results could result in further volatility. The pound has surged by 1% this morning after Brexit secretary David Davis suggested that the UK could make payments in return for access to the European markets. The comments have fuelled hopes in the City that Britain might avoid a \u2018hard Brexit\u2019, and that Britain\u2019s financial services industry, for example, could retain access to the single market after 2019 (the likely exit date). Our political reporter Jess Elgot explains what happened: David Davis has suggested that the government would consider making contributions to the EU budget in exchange for access to the single market, saying his Department for Exiting the EU would consider all options to get the best deal with the bloc. During questions in the House of Commons, the Labour MP Wayne David asked if the Brexit secretary would \u201cconsider making any contribution in any shape or form for access to the single market\u201d. Davis said the government would look at the options during the article 50 process over the next two years. \u201cThe major criterion here is that we get the best possible access for goods and services to the European market,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if that is included in what he is talking about, then of course we would consider it. Here\u2019s her full story: This chart shows how the pound surged by one and a half cents, or 1.2%, since Davis\u2019s comments, to $1.2650. That\u2019s its highest level since the US election three weeks ago. Neil Jones, head of FX hedge fund sales at Mizuho, told Reuters that some traders have been racing to buy the pound -- or unwind bets against sterling. \u201cThese headlines suggesting Britain may be able to access the single market are generating substantial sterling demand from traders and investors looking to reduce their short positions and unwind hedges.\u201d Consumers should brace for higher petrol prices soon, warns Michelle McGrade, chief investment officer of TD Direct Investing: \u201cIt\u2019s been clear for some time that the low price of oil has been hurting producers. In my view, it was only a matter of time before OPEC decided to cut production. A higher oil price, together with a strong US dollar, makes things tougher for UK consumers because not only will petrol be more expensive, but this could fuel a stronger surge in inflation than originally expected, as inflation is highly correlated to the price of oil. The combination makes for an unwelcome gift just before Christmas. We\u2019ve checked with the AA about the report that filling up a car will soon cost an extra \u00a35. They say that\u2019s based on oil hitting $60 -- so we\u2019re not there yet. But the 12% jump in the oil price this week is still going to hurt drivers... Back to Opec.... and the oil price is clinging onto today\u2019s gains, as analysts keep kicking the tires of yesterday\u2019s deal. Brent crude is hovering around $52.50, a 1.2% gain today. That means it has surged by 12% since yesterday morning, just before Opec\u2019s members sat down and hammered out the supply cuts deal. City traders are pondering: Will Opec members actually deliver the production cuts they signed up to yesterday? Will non-Opec members support the deal by cutting supply (as Opec hopes)? Neil Wilson of ETX Capital says this uncertainty means the oil price could fall back: OPEC has suggested the deal is contingent on getting this 600,000 b/d from non-OPEC \u2013 we don\u2019t yet know if it could unravel if this doesn\u2019t happen. There are lots of pieces in the jigsaw that are yet to fall into place. If OPEC members stick to the script and if non-OPEC comes up with the goods we might be on for further gains in crude. If not this rally could easily lose momentum and fade. And.... the more the oil price goes up, though, the more incentive there is for US shale producers to turn their pumps back on. Bloomberg Gadfly writer Liam Denning reckons this issue will be crucial: Supporting the market in this way hands an opportunity to U.S. exploration and production firms to hedge future production at higher prices and expand their own drilling budgets to fill some of the gap left by Saudi Arabia, Russia and others. Over the next six months, we will see if OPEC\u2019s coalition can hold. Assume it does -- a huge assumption at this point -- and in the following six months we will see how much the frackers will do to undermine it. His full take is here: Now this really is a moment..... unemployment across the eurozone has fallen below 10% for the first time in over five years, and is now at a seven-year low. Eurostat reports that the jobless rate fell to 9.8% in October. September\u2019s figure has been revised down to 9.9% (from 10%). Eurozone unemployment hasn\u2019t been below 10% since April 2011, and October\u2019s reading is actually the lowest since 2009. Over the last year, unemployment has fallen in 24 of Europe\u2019s 28 members. The largest annual decreases were registered in Croatia (from 16.1% to 12.7%), Spain (from 21.2% to 19.2%) and Slovakia (from 11.1% to 9.1%). Italy and France have also reported falls in unemployment, as Europe\u2019s slow-but-steady recovery continues. Economists fear that British factories could hike their prices to help them handle a sharp rise in raw material costs since the summer. George Nikolaidis, senior economist at EEF, says the weaker pound is both a challenge and an opportunity for manufacturing: While the more competitive exchange rate means UK manufacturers are well positioned to capitalise on the recovery in demand in key export markets, higher input costs are coming through the manufacturing supply chain thick and fast to put the squeeze on profit margins. Manufacturers are inevitably looking to pass these costs on to customers adding to the inflationary pressures already building up in the UK economy.\u201d Mike Rigby, head of manufacturing at Barclays also believes consumers will be hit by higher prices next year: Exporters continue to take advantage of a weak sterling but it is increasingly looking like a case of having to take the rough with the smooth as businesses start to pass on higher import costs, which could accelerate inflationary pressures as we enter 2017.\u201d And Jeremy Cook of World First fears that the recent jump in output could be slowing: Breaking: Growth in Britain\u2019s manufacturing sector slowed last month, despite the weak pound helping firms export abroad. The UK factory PMI, which measures activity across the sector, has fallen to 53.4, down from 54.4 in October. That\u2019s weaker than the City expected, but it does still show that the sector has expanded for four month running -- as the initial Brexit shock quickly ebbed away. Firms reported that output and new orders both expanded at a solid date. Markit, which compiles the figures, also warns that the weak pound is driving up import costs -- as well as making UK goods more attractive to overseas buyers. The effects of the weak sterling exchange rate continued to be felt by manufacturers during November. On the plus side, the boost to export competitiveness led to a further increase in new business from abroad. Companies reported improved demand from the USA, mainland Europe and the Middle East. The negative impact of the exchange rate was felt on the cost side. Average purchase prices rose at a pace close to October\u2019s near six-year record and again at one of the fastest rates in the survey history. The Financial Times has a good piece about how some Opec members are paying a higher price than others to get the deal through: Here\u2019s a flavour: Saudi Arabia and its Gulf Arab allies, including Kuwait, United Arab Emirates and Qatar, have agreed to shoulder the bulk of the cuts. They are banking on a quick recovery in price to ensure they do not lose revenues or surrender market share to other suppliers. Iran and Iraq, which sit outside the Gulf bloc in the Middle East, have sacrificed less. Most oil analysts see the limited concessions they made to let the deal succeed as largely face-saving technical measures to placate the Saudis. Other members from Venezuela to Angola, which have agreed to cut part of their output in support of a 1.2m barrel-a-day reduction, have a patchy record of compliance with past deals. Despite Wednesday\u2019s price surge, they may need an ongoing recovery to be convinced to do their share. Newsflash: Europe\u2019s factor sector has posted its strongest growth in close to three years. Data firm Markit\u2019s monthly manufacturing PMI has risen to 53.7, up from 53.5 in October. Any reading over 50 shows an expansion, and this is the best reading since January 2014. The sector was driven by the Netherlands, Austria and Spain - while poor old Greece suffered its biggest contraction in a year. Factories also reported that cost pressures are rising sharply, meaning they\u2019re paying more for raw materials. Opec\u2019s production cut may make that worse.... Dominic Rossi, global CIO equities at Fidelity International, urges caution: \u201cI would not get too excited by the Opec cut. Compliance will be a problem, and the Russians will pump more gas instead. In the meantime, the long-run marginal cost of US shale continues to fall. I would not chase this oil price rally too hard.\u201d City experts are a little sceptical that Opec\u2019s deal will actually push oil prices much higher. Spanish banking group BBVA suggest warn that \u201cimplementing and monitoring\u201d the deal could be constrained by \u201cgeopolitical factors\u201d (for example, Saudi Arabia and Iran are already backing rival sides in the Yemen conflict) Australia\u2019s ANZ bank point out that US shale producers could boost their own output, keeping a lid on prices. City analyst Louise Cooper questions suggests Iraq can stick to the deal: (Some of Iraq\u2019s oil fields are based in Iraqi Kurdistan, to the north of the country, where the peshmerga military forces are based) The Wall Street Journal has created an excellent graphic, showing how Opec has created the current oil glut by pumping harder, while US shale producers have cut back: The WSJ also explains how Saudi and Iran managed to settle on a deal: The member countries were faced with a \u201cvery deep\u201d abyss of low oil prices, and that won out over politics, said Daniel Yergin, vice chairman of IHS Markit and a longtime oil-market watcher. \u201cOPEC is back in business,\u201d Mr. Yergin said in an interview. \u201cThis will rank as one of their historic decisions.\u201d Saudi Arabia and Iran, whose differences blocked a deal that aimed to freeze production earlier this year, made the deal possible by coming to a tortured compromise on production figures. Iran was allowed to increase its production by 90,000 barrels a day, a significant victory for the Islamic Republic as it tries to rebuild its economy after the end of Western sanctions. But the deal allows both Iran and Saudi Arabia to claim a win, by pointing to different sets of numbers. Iran, using production figures generated by OPEC, can say it is raising output, while Saudi Arabia can point to the Islamic Republic\u2019s output figures and say that Iran is agreeing to a cut. \u201cIt\u2019s a good day for the oil market, it\u2019s a good day for the oil industry,\u201d Saudi Arabian Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said after the deal was reached. Shares in energy companies are jumping today too. In London, Royal Dutch Shell and BP are leading the risers on the FTSE 100; a higher oil price should mean higher profits. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets says trader are ignoring concerns that the deal may not stick (especially if non-Opec members don\u2019t agree their own cuts). Long-term apprehension surrounding the deal (and the potential for a pick-up in US shale production) will be thrown to the back of investors\u2019 minds as Brent regains a $52 handle and US Crude fast approaches $50 per barrel. How long can the post-deal rally last? Opec\u2019s deal is bad news for motorists, as higher crude prices will swiftly lead to more expensive petrol. The front page of today\u2019s Times declares that it could mean a litre of fuel costs 10p more, which swiftly adds up: Motorists face paying \u00a35 more to fill up an average family car after a Saudi-led cartel struck a rare deal to boost the price of oil. Oil prices jumped by 8.9 per cent to $50.45 a barrel yesterday after the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec), which pumps a third of the world\u2019s oil, agreed to limit output for the first time in eight years. Motoring groups warned that the agreement was likely to create an \u201cunwelcome Christmas present\u201d for families by sharply pushing up prices on the forecourt. Petrol fell to 101p a litre in February after oil plunged to $27 a barrel as Iran increased production when sanctions were lifted. Some analysts now predict that oil could rise to $60 a barrel. According to estimates, this could push petrol to a two-year high of 123p a litre, from 114p today. The oil price has extended its gains this morning as the financial markets continue to digest Opec\u2019s output cut deal. US crude oil smashed through $50 per barrel for the first time in a month this morning. Brent crude - oil sourced from the North Sea - jumped by another 1% to $52.73. Yesterday, oil surged by over 8% as it became clear that Opec had, for once, come up with a plan to tackle the oil glut. Traders are genuinely surprised that Opec members put their differences behind them in Vienna this week, and agreed to cut 1.2m barrels off their daily output, to 32.5m. Russia also caught the experts out; it is backing Opec\u2019s deal by promising to trim its own output by 300,000 barrels per day. That means that non-Opec members may, as Opec hopes, chip in with a 600,000bpd reduction. Chris Weston of IG explains that this could give the deal extra teeth: The consensus was that we would get some sort of loose agreement from the collective that kept oil supported, but left the market asking many more questions. What we have seen however has been real meat on the bone, not just from gaining an understanding around production cut allocations from the more tricky OPEC members, including Iran and Iraq, but it seems Russia was so enthused by what they heard that they have increased their own production cut levels from 200,000 to 250,000 to 300,000 a day through the first half in 2017. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Opec members are still in celebratory mood after agreeing their first output cut in almost a decade. The oil cartel defied the sceptics yesterday, by announcing it would slash production by 1.2m barrels per day, in an attempt to tackle the glut of crude oil in the market. As we covered yesterday, this sent the oil price soaring - and we\u2019re seeing further gains this morning. Analysts are now wondering if the deal will hold, and what it means for other producers, consumers, and the global economy. Also coming up today... Data firm Markit is publishing its latest manufacturing PMI reports, showing how factories around the globe fared last month. The big news overnight is that China\u2019s manufacturing sector beat forecasts, expanding at its fastest rate in over four years. This may signal that China is, once again, relying on traditional smokestack \u201cindustries\u201d industries for growth, rather than transforming into a consumer-driven economy. We find out how Britain, and Europe, performed in the next couple of hours: Here\u2019s what to watch out for: 9am GMT: eurozone manufacturing PMI 9.30am GMT: UK manufacturing PMI 2.45pm GMT: US manufacturing PMI And there are also signs today that Britain\u2019s housing market is slowing. The Nationwide building society has reported that prices only rose by 0.1% in November, meaning prices were just 4.4% higher than a year ago.",

      "bodyText": "The new chief executive of the Daily Mail &amp; General Trust, the parent of the Daily Mail and Mail Online, has refused to rule out a potential sale of the newspaper, saying there are \u201cno sacred cows\u201d in his strategic review of the business. Paul Zwillenberg, the Boston Consulting Group senior executive who took over at DMGT in June, said that if the right price was offered he would have to consider a sale. \u201cThere are no sacred cows,\u201d he told a City analyst who asked at DMGT\u2019s full-year results presentation if the titles could be sold off. \u201cWe are, have been, and continue to be an active portfolio manager. If someone values our business significantly greater than we value it ourselves, we will listen.\u201d However, analysts believe that DMGT will never sell the print titles, although the digital future of Mail Online could be less certain. DMGT can trace its roots to the launch of the Daily Mail in 1896, and Lord Rothermere, the current chairman, whose family is the controlling shareholder, is the great-grandson of one of the newspaper\u2019s co-founders. \u201cA sale of the Daily Mail is a very low-probability outcome of the strategic review,\u201d said Alex DeGroote, analyst at Peel Hunt. \u201cIt is part of the DNA of the group and it is not performing that badly.\u201d He added that DMGT\u2019s move earlier this year to enter talks with private equity companies interested in bidding for Yahoo pointed to the potential for a strategic deal to boost Mail Online in the US. \u201cThe Yahoo move tells you where their thinking is at,\u201d he said. \u201cIt means they could be open to partnering with a US internet property to create more scale. It is the only way they are going to crack it. They have a foothold, but need to scale up.\u201d DMGT profits fell by a quarter at its newspaper operation following a double-digit fall in print advertising revenues and investment in Mail Online in the year to the end of September. The company reported a 23% fall in operating profits, to \u00a377m, at its consumer division, DMG Media, which takes in the Daily Mail, Mail on Sunday, Mail Online and freesheet Metro. The group also took a \u00a325m writedown on US millennials site Elite Daily. Total revenues for the Mail businesses fell by 2% to \u00a3577m in the financial year to September, offsetting a 12% fall in print advertising income. Mail Online increased its revenues 19% year on year, to \u00a393m, up on the 16% growth rate in 2015. Revenues at Mail Online\u2019s US operation, a huge focus for the media group, grew by 28% to \u00a324m, as the company said it began to gain real traction as a brand among advertising buyers. \u201cWe have been increasing our digital investments to build the critical scale required internationally and I expect Mail Online to continue on its path to profitability,\u201d said the DMGT chief executive, Paul Zwillenberg. Operating profits at the Mail businesses fell by 17% to \u00a369m. Metro saw revenues fall 9% to \u00a365m and profits drop 12% to \u00a315m. About 200 jobs were cut at DMG Media over the year. The company said that losses at Elite Daily, the \u201cvoice of generation Y\u201d, which it acquired in January last year, had \u201cexceeded expectations\u201d. It has completely written down the value of the business, incurring a \u00a325m impairment charge. Revenues at Elite Daily grew 44% to \u00a310m. DMGT said the performance of its consumer division, together with declines at Euromoney, dragged the businesses\u2019 total adjusted operating profits down 11% to \u00a3277m. Its business-to-business portfolio, which includes events, information and the RMS division, helped keep total revenues stable at \u00a31.9bn. Total revenues, profits and earnings per share beat analysts\u2019 expectations, leading to a 7% jump in DMGT\u2019s share price in early trading. \u201cOverall, we expect the earnings per share and solid guidance to drive a positive share price reaction, in the context of cheap valuation and perceived kitchen-sinking risk with the new chief executive,\u201d said William Packer, the executive director of media equity research at Exane BNP Paribas. On Thursday morning, Zwillenberg outlined the details of a new strategy to analysts and investors that \u201cfocuses on improving operational execution, increasing the portfolio\u2019s focus and enhancing financial flexibility\u201d. Zwillenberg has been conducting a review of the DMGT business since his arrival in June. The company indicatedthat it may sell off or exit some areas of its business. \u201cWhen we look at our businesses, we recognise that fundamentally some have more potential than others,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are some businesses where we are the best owner and others that we may not be. We are not a forced seller of any assets. We will sell when the time is right, when [specific] businesses are worth more to other people than to us.\u201d Some analysts have argued that DMGT should be split into media and business-to-business operations. In September, DMGT said it had cut more than 400 jobs in the past year, with \u201cjust less than half\u201d coming from DMG Media, which employs 2,700 staff, while the company employs 10,000 globally. It has taken \u00a355m in exceptional charges, \u00a337m of which relates to organisational and headcount reduction costs. In May, DMGT issued a profit warning driven by a double-digit decline in its print advertising business in the first half.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Nestl\u00e9 says it has found a way of slashing the amount of sugar in some of its chocolate bars by 40%, without compromising the taste. The Swiss food company, whose products include Kit Kats, Aeros and Yorkies, said it has achieved the reduction by discovering a way \u201cto structure sugar differently\u201d. The new process is said to make sugar dissolve faster so that even when less is used, the tongue perceives an identical level of sweetness. It plans to patent the process, discovered by its scientists, which it says will enable it to significantly decrease the total sugar in its confectionery products. Sugar has been blamed for fuelling the obesity epidemic crippling the NHS in the UK and health campaigners have urged confectionery companies to cut unnecessary sugar from their products. In 2014, Action on Sugar was launched with the goal of encouraging government and manufacturers to cut sugar in food by 30%. In that context, Nestl\u00e9\u2019s self-proclaimed breakthrough is likely to be welcomed, should it live up to its claims, and be potentially lucrative to the company. It says it will begin to use the faster-dissolving sugar in its confectionery products from 2018. A four-finger milk chocolate Kit Kat currently contains 23.8g of sugar, a plain (milk chocolate) Yorkie contains 26.9g and a medium peppermint Aero has 24.9g of sugar. If the amount of sugar in each of these products was cut by 40% the new amounts would be 14.3g, 16.1g and 14.9g respectively. Dietary sugar should account for no more than 5% of daily calories consumed, which equates to 30g for those aged 11 and over, according to the UK\u2019s official nutrition advisers. Figures published in September showed that in 2012-14 the average was 13.4% for those aged between four and 10, 15.2% among 11- to 18-year-olds, 12.3% for adults under 65 and 11.1% for those aged 65 and over. Nestl\u00e9\u2019s chief technology officer, Stefan Catsicas, said: \u201cThis truly groundbreaking research is inspired by nature and has the potential to reduce total sugar by up to 40% in our confectionery. \u201cOur scientists have discovered a completely new way to use a traditional, natural ingredient.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "British Gas has become the second leading energy supplier to freeze its standard prices this winter. The company, the UK\u2019s biggest energy firm, said the move would bring some peace of mind to more than 6 million customers. But consumer organisations said energy companies needed to do more than just freeze prices and warned that price rises of up to 10% were likely after the end of the winter. Two weeks ago SSE, one of Britain\u2019s \u201cbig six\u201d energy suppliers, froze its standard tariffs, putting pressure on rivals to follow suit. Wholesale gas and electricity prices have risen sharply since June, prompting some smaller energy firms to raise their prices. Many bigger companies have already bought gas and electricity for delivery during the winter at lower prices. In a Christmas message, British Gas said it was keeping the price of its standard variable energy tariff unchanged through this winter. A spokeswoman said prices had been frozen until at least the end of March. The company has also launched a deal that allows households to fix their energy prices for three winters, until March 2019. Its standard variable energy tariff paid by direct debit is \u00a31,044 \u2013 \u00a340 more than its cheapest deal, a one-year fix at \u00a31,004. Consumer organisations gave a guarded response. Citizens Advice welcomed the winter price freezes from British Gas and SEE, and called on other big energy firms to follow suit. Joe Malinowski, of TheEnergyShop.com, said: \u201cThat\u2019s not a big deal, it\u2019s only a few months. It\u2019s a nice gesture but, call me cynical, the already expensive standard tariffs are going to stay expensive for this winter.\u201d Gillian Guy, the chief executive of Citizens Advice, agreed, saying: \u201cEnergy customers on the standard tariff are already paying a premium \u2013 their bills are as much as \u00a3380 more than for those on cheaper fixed deals.\u201d Martin Lewis, the founder of MoneySavingExpert.com, said the huge increase in wholesale prices and the weaker pound would soon enough affect household bills. \u201cCome the end of winter, expect to see hikes of up to 10% by many of the big six companies,\u201d he added. Consumer organisations urged energy companies and the government to take further action. Guy said: \u201cIt\u2019s also important that the government looks at a more permanent way to bring down costs for people on the standard tariff. One way to do this would be to automatically switch low-income customers who have been on the standard tariff for years to a cheaper deal.\u201d The chief executive of British Gas, Mark Hodges, sought to address concerns by making a \u201ccommitment that all British Gas customers will always get access to our best deals\u201d. He promised an annual health check for customers on the standard rate to ensure they are on the right tariff. There has been mounting criticism from politicians about the treatment of loyal customers by the large energy firms. When the business secretary, Greg Clark, met representatives from the industry earlier this month, he vowed to take action to ensure it treats customers properly. A recent report commissioned by industry lobby group Energy UK showed it cost the big six energy companies \u00a3844 to provide dual fuel this year. But the average household bill was more than \u00a31,000, according to campaign group BigDeal.com. Theresa May used her Conservative party conference speech in October to criticise the high number of customers on standard contracts, saying: \u201cIt\u2019s just not right that two-thirds of energy customers are stuck on the most expensive tariffs.\u201d Alex Neill, the managing director of home and legal services at consumer group Which?, said: \u201cWhile it\u2019s welcome that another big energy supplier is freezing its standard tariff prices, these are generally the most expensive deals on the market and customers should look to see if they can switch to a better deal.\u201d",

A reading above 50 signals expansion; a reading below points to contraction. The industry has been growing for four months, but growth has eased in output and new orders from the highs reached in September. Sterling, which has dropped sharply since the EU referendum in June, continues to push up manufacturers\u2019 costs, prompting them to raise their prices. Selling prices rose for the seventh month, and at a rate close to October\u2019s 64-month high. This is further evidence that consumers face higher prices for food and household goods in coming months. Rob Dobson, senior economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey, said overall manufacturing \u201cremained in good health\u201d. \u201cAlthough the recent growth spurt showed further signs of slowing, the pace of expansion is still solid and above its long-term trend.

The weaker pound has boosted export orders, he said, but added: \u201cThe concern is that higher costs may in time offset any positive effect of the weaker exchange rate, especially given that export order book growth has already waned markedly from September\u2019s five and a half year high.\u201d A recent survey from the Confederation of British Industry painted a similar picture.

Fairbairn expressed alarm after the prime minister\u2019s conference speech appeared to presage a hardline approach to Brexit and the home secretary, Amber Rudd, appeared to criticise firms employing a large proportion of foreign workers. But she pointed to a change of tone more recently and welcomed May\u2019s decision to row back from her proposal to put workers on company boards, to the dismay of trade unions. \u201cWe are sensing a stronger desire to engage with business: stronger than it was at the time of the conference,\u201d Fairbairn said, describing May\u2019s emollient speech to the business group\u2019s annual conference last week as an \u201cimportant moment\u201d. Labour accused May of caving in to corporate lobbying after the corporate governance proposals were published earlier this week. Fairbairn said: \u201cWe have been having conversations with Number 10 and BEIS [Department for Business, Energy &amp; Industrial Strategy] \u2013 very productive conversations.\u201d",
