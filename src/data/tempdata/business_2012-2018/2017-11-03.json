      "bodyText": "The scandal-ridden 2 Sisters Food Group chicken factory in West Bromwich is to resume production next week after \u201csignificant changes\u201d at the plant and the introduction of full-time Food Standards Agency (FSA) officials to oversee its procedures. The move comes after the country\u2019s largest supplier of supermarket chicken temporarily shut the plant five weeks ago, following undercover filming by the Guardian and ITV News that revealed poor hygiene standards and food safety records being altered. Marks &amp; Spencer, Tesco and Aldi said they would resume taking supplies from the factory, where a team of M&amp;S technologists had been working on site and as \u201cthe FSA will have a full-time presence at the site to support the 2 Sisters management team\u201d. Marks &amp; Spencer said: \u201cWe have assessed the changes made at the site by 2 Sisters and are confident it can meet our high production standards. We will work closely with the site\u2019s management team and the FSA in the coming weeks.\u201d Tesco added: \u201cFollowing the retraining programme carried out by 2 Sisters at its West Bromwich site, we can confirm we will begin to receive orders from the site again in the coming days. \u201cWe are satisfied the issues have been addressed and work will now be carried out to our high production standards. We\u2019ll continue to work with 2 Sisters and the FSA as the site gets back up and running.\u201d Aldi said: \u201cAs a result of the remedial measures 2 Sisters Food Group have put in place we are satisfied that all issues have been resolved.\u201d A spokesman for 2 Sisters said: \u201cWe can confirm that following comprehensive retraining sessions with all colleagues during October, we are restarting production at our site D facility in West Bromwich (w/c 6 November). \u201cThis will be phased over the coming weeks, working closely with our customers in the process. \u201cWe would like to thank our colleagues at the site who have acted with understanding and professionalism during this unsettling period.\u201d The reopening is a welcome piece of news for the site\u2019s 850 workers, who have been retrained following the scandal and whose jobs were at risk without changes being made to the running of the plant. The announcement is also timely for the food company, which is scheduled to announce its financial results to investors on Tuesday. The closure of the plant was costing the company \u00a3500,000 a week. In September, Marks &amp; Spencer, Aldi and Lidl all announced they had suspended deliveries from the West Bromwich factory immediately after the airing of the undercover footage, and they were followed over the next two days by Sainsbury\u2019s and Tesco. M&amp;S said the video showed \u201cunacceptable\u201d standards and also pulled chicken sourced from the plant from its shelves. Sainsbury\u2019s said it had no plans to resume supplies from the West Bromwich factory. Lidl said its position had not changed. The scandal also led to the group\u2019s founder and chief executive, Ranjit Singh Boparan, being grilled in front of a parliamentary select committee last month, during which he apologised for the crisis and pledged to fund the cost of independent inspectors to police all 12 of his UK chicken sites. The concessions came during a session of the Commons environment, food and rural affairs committee, in which Boparan, whose firm produces one-third of all poultry products eaten in the UK, was evasive when quizzed if the company had breached food safety regulations, and repeatedly declined to answer direct questions on the topic. The inquiry was called after the Guardian and ITV News recorded undercover footage in August showing an instance of 2 Sisters workers altering the source and slaughter date of poultry being processed at the firm\u2019s Site D plant in West Bromwich. Other 2 Sisters workers have also told the Guardian and ITV News that they have been instructed to alter \u201ckill dates\u201d. Further footage showed chicken being retrieved from the floor of the plant and returned to the production line, plus older chicken being mixed with fresher birds. Prof Chris Elliott, a food safety academic from Queen\u2019s University Belfast who led the UK government\u2019s independent review of food systems after the 2013 horsemeat scandal, said he had inspected many food businesses in the past four years and had \u201cnever seen one operate under such poor standards\u201d as the video evidence showed. While Boparan apologised for the factory\u2019s problems and admitted that the footage showing the changing of kill dates looked wrong, he contested MPs\u2019 claims that altering the labels was a breach of regulations. The entrepreneur claimed employees were actually correcting slaughter dates erroneously attached to trays of chicken crowns, although subsequent comments by his technical director, Chris Gilbert-Wood, have been more measured with him telling MPs that this was what \u201ccould be\u201d happening in the footage. The worker shown changing the kill dates has been dismissed, after the company instigated disciplinary proceedings citing allegations he had breached food safety regulations. 2 Sisters Food Group is the UK\u2019s second-largest food processing company by turnover and claims to handle about 6m chickens every week.",

      "bodyText": "Shares in Britain\u2019s top 100 companies reached an all-time high on Friday, after buoyant sales across the services sector last month showed the economy remained resilient following the post-Brexit vote slump. A flurry of orders that appeared to bolster the Bank of England move to raise interest rates this week, helped send the FTSE 100 index to 7,560, beating the previous end of day high of 7,556 on 12 October. The B&amp;Q owner Kingfisher and the drugs groups Informa and NMC Health were among the biggest gainers along with the bottling plant arm of Coca-Cola. Services firms \u201csignalled a shift in momentum\u201d, according to a survey of the sector as activity expanded at the fastest rate since May, helped by a rise in sales and a string of successful product launches. Analysts said the survey showed the services sector, which makes up almost 80% of UK economic activity, remained resilient despite Brexit uncertainty. The pound, which had come under pressure following a gloomy outlook for the economy from the Bank of England on Thursday, regained ground lost during the previous day against the dollar and the euro. Sterling hit $1.31 after falling to $1.30 on Thursday. Ben Broadbent, the deputy governor of the central bank, said on the BBC\u2019s Today programme that the BoE\u2019s monetary policy committee report \u2013 indicating that it may need to raise interest rates two more times to bring down inflation \u2013 was not a promise. While justifying an increase in the Bank\u2019s base rate by 0.25% to 0.5%, which a majority of the Bank\u2019s interest rate setters agreed despite a series of lacklustre economic surveys, he conceded that the outlook remained weak and Brexit uncertainty was weighing on the UK\u2019s economic performance. \u201cIt is clearly having some effects on the economy. We think investment is weaker than it would otherwise have been,\u201d he said. \u201cObviously consumption has been affected significantly by the squeeze on real incomes that results from last year\u2019s referendum,\u201d he said. The low value of the pound has pushed up the cost of imports and sent inflation up to 3% in September, while wages growth was stuck at 2.2%. At 55.6 in October, up from 53.6 in September, the headline purchasing managers index (PMI) for the services sector was slightly stronger than the post-crisis trend and signalled the fastest pace of business activity growth for six months, said IHS Markit. A reading above 50 indicates an expansion in activity. However, job creation in the services sector added to the picture of a weak outlook after firms reported the weakest rise in seven months. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey, said: \u201cWhile an upturn in business activity growth adds some justification to the Bank of England\u2019s decision to hike interest rates for the first time in a decade, a deeper dive into the numbers highlights the fragility of the economy and points to downside risks for the outlook. \u201cA downturn in business optimism about the year ahead, fuelled mainly by Brexit-related uncertainty, suggests that risks are tilted to the downside as far as future growth is concerned. Not surprisingly, employment growth slowed for a second successive month as the business mood grew more cautious and risk averse.\u201d Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said: \u201cSerious uncertainties over the outlook evident among services companies fuels suspicion that it is likely to be some considerable time before the Bank of England hikes interest rates again.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The FTSE 100 may have hit a closing high after a day of dithering, but it was a more mixed picture elsewhere. Germany\u2019s Dax also hit a new closing peak, while France\u2019s Cac also closed higher. But Spain\u2019s Ibex fell back, on news that members of the deposed Catalan government were being jailed. US markets moved higher following the widely watched non-farm payroll figures and bumper results from Apple. The closing scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 5.03 points or 0.07% at a new record close of 7560.35 Germany\u2019s Dax rose 0.28% to 13,478.86 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.14% higher at 5517.97 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 0.14% to 23,014.13 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 0.96% at 10,357.8 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.14% to 763.56 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 38 points or 0.16%. On that note it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back next week. The UK\u2019s leading share index has hit a new closing high - just. The FTSE 100 finished up 0.07% at 7560.35, beating the previous record of 7556.24 set on 12 October. But it is still well below the intra-day high of 7598. In a day when the index drifted from positive to negative and back again, the rise has been driven by the pound losing much of its early gains against the dollar. A weak sterling helps the many overseas earners in the index. It may be a quieter week on the corporate and economic front but markets could still press on to yet more record high, reckons Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG: Although the [US] jobs report fell short of the lofty forecasts made earlier in the week, the solid rebound from last month\u2019s number, plus strong revisions to previous two months, meant that the overall impression of a healthy US economy remains intact, and thus leaves us still expecting the Fed to raise rates once more this year. After the relentless nature of the newsflow of the past few days, investors seem to have taken the afternoon off, with some judicious profit-taking to round off the week. Sterling valiantly tried to claw its way off the lows hit yesterday, after the swan-dive following the BoE news, but despite Ben Broadbent\u2019s best efforts to say \u2018no, we really do want to keep raising rates\u2019, the deputy governor failed to dispel the impression that the MPC will now sit on its hands and await developments. With over 80% of the S&amp;P 500 having reported, and 77% of them having beaten estimates, we are now into the scrag-end of earnings season. Overall the period has been firmly supportive of equity prices, even at their current elevated levels. With the coming week seeing a notable downturn in big-ticket corporate and economic events, equities will just have to get by on bullish momentum alone. On the evidence of the past year though, this should be enough to send them to new record highs. It was a mixed day for US data, with the dollar finally deciding it was all broadly positive, says Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex: While the headline non-farm figure rocketed higher from the hurricane-hit (but upwards revised) 18k in September to 261k in October, that was markedly lower than the blockbuster 312k expected by analysts. The (arguably more important) wage growth reading also came in worse than forecast, plunging from 0.5% to 0.0% month-on-month. Yet any disappointment was tempered by the unemployment rate, which fell to a 17 year low of 4.1%. Elsewhere an underperforming Markit services PMI, which arrived at 55.3 against the initial 55.9 estimate, was countered by a stellar ISM number, at 60.1 against the 59.8 forecast. After a bit of a wobble post-jobs report that ISM services PMI seemed to swing things in favour of the dollar, which rose 0.4% against the euro and 0.3% against the yen. Only against the pound did the greenback struggle, and even then it held onto almost all of Thursday\u2019s hefty gains. As for the Dow Jones, the index was pretty flat after the bell, though is still at a 23500-plus all-time high following Apple\u2019s Q4-inspired rise. Though the pound couldn\u2019t make any great inroads against the dollar, rising just 0.1%, against the euro it had more successful, climbing half a percent to re-cross \u20ac1.125. This helped erase the FTSE\u2019s early growth, meaning the UK index may struggle to close at the record high it was promising during the morning\u2019s trading. There was more US data this afternoon, with better than expected factory goods orders. They rose by 1.4% in September, up from 1.2% in August and higher than the 1.3% increase forecast by economists. On the prospect of another Fed rate hike: On the Markit service sector survey, Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit said: The services PMI survey highlights the dilemma facing the Fed as it seeks to determine the right policy course amid signs of solid growth but soft inflation. Together with the manufacturing PMI, which rose higher in October as hurricane-related supply chain disruptions eased, the latest services survey is consistent with underlying growth in the economy of approximately 3%, as well as buoyant jobs growth. With the data for October setting the scene for another robust GDP increase in the fourth quarter, a December rate hike is very much on the cards. However, a drop in inflationary pressures adds an element of uncertainty to the picture. Having been buoyed by supply chain disruptions in prior months, input cost pressures eased at the start of the fourth quarter, and the rate of increase of average prices charged for goods and services dropped markedly. While the Fed may likely tilt towards hiking in December on the back of robust economic growth, much may depend on the data flow in coming weeks for signs that stronger growth is feeding through to higher prices. If the US jobs data presented a rather mixed package, the latest surveys of the service sector are no more clear cut. The ISM non-manufacturing index for October came in at a better than expected 60.1, up from 59.8 in the previous month and higher than the forecast figure of 58.5. This is the highest level since August 2005 and the 94th consecutive month of growth. And here are some of the comments from the survey\u2019s respondents: \u201cIncreasing commodity pricing along with rising construction cost is a concern in [the] quarter ahead.\u201d (Accommodation &amp; Food Services) \u201cBusiness is strong, driven by large upticks in business from clients in the retail industry. Seasonal surge is starting out stronger than in a normal year.\u201d (Management of Companies &amp; Support Services) \u201cThe current hurricane damage will result in a shortage of some building materials and draw labor forces away from our area.\u201d (Construction) \u201cPositive trends continue. Business activity/results good. Revenue and net profit are above plan.\u201d (Finance &amp; Insurance) \u201cWe continue to struggle with the \u2018unknowns\u2019 around Obamacare, and its impacts on our health care and insurance businesses.\u201d (Health Care &amp; Social Assistance) \u201cBusiness activity with oil companies remains flat. Oil field services, midstream, downstream and petrochemical sectors remain strong.\u201d (Professional, Scientific &amp; Technical Services) \u201cBusiness levels increased due to hurricane recovery efforts.\u201d (Real Estate, Rental &amp; Leasing) \u201cOutlook is favorable. Labor is in short supply and is constraining growth.\u201d (Wholesale Trade) \u201cUptick based on replacement vehicle activity in hurricane-impacted areas of Texas and Florida.\u201d (Retail Trade) But earlier, the rival Markit services PMI was a lower than expected 55.3, down from an initial estimate of 55.9 and the same level as in September. US markets are off to a positive start. Investors took a positive view of the jobs numbers, while Apple also helped after its positive results and upbeat comments on the iPhone X. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 23 points or 0.11% at a new record high, while the S&amp;P 500 opened up 0.05% and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.29%. As for Apple, its shares are up around 3% in early dealings. The pound continues to hold onto its gains after the better than expected service sector data: However the dollar continues its recovery against other currencies: Here\u2019s the view from Danske Bank on the non-farm numbers: Here\u2019s our report on the jobs figures: The US economy bounced back in October from a dramatic slump in hiring in the wake of two devastating hurricanes, the labor department announced on Friday. The US added 261,000 new jobs and the unemployment rate ticked down to 4.1%. In September the US shed 30,000 jobs \u2013 the first loss in seven years \u2013 as hurricanes Harvey and Irma held back hiring in Texas and Florida. The leisure and hospitality industry was hardest hit by the hurricanes in September, shedding 111,000 jobs. Employment in food services and drinking places rose sharply in October \u2013 up 89,000 \u2013 following a decrease of 98,000 in September. October\u2019s figure was still lower than analysts had expected, perhaps reflecting the continued impact of the storms. September was the second month of disappointing growth in the US jobs market. The labor department had calculated that the US had added 169,000 new positions in August, below the 180,000 that had been expected by economists. But the figures from August and September have now been revised up, to 208,000 and 18,000 respectively. And at 4.1% the unemployment rate is now at lows unseen since December 2000. Wage growth, which has been slow since the recession, stalled in October. Average hourly earnings fell by one cent in October to $26.53 an hour. Economists had expected a slight monthly gain. More here: The dollar has recovered from its initial falls in the wake of the jobs data, with traders coming round to the view that a December rate rise is still on the cards. Neil Wilson at ETX Capital: The dollar fell and Treasuries rose after the monthly US jobs report missed expectations and wages failed to grow by as much as anticipated. The dollar index dropped half a percent before coming back to pare losses. Having sunk below 113.70 on the release from above 114.10, at send time USDJPY was steadying around 113.90. EURUSD\u2019s gains have all but been erased and, at just below 1.1670, euro-dollar is almost flat for the day. Bit of a kneejerk on the misses for jobs and wages but sentiment seems to be recovering pretty swiftly as it won\u2019t stop the Fed hiking in December. Markets still see a greater than 90% chance the FOMC will raise rates at the next meeting. With tax reform now on the table we have to also assume that policymakers will start to factor that in to their projections \u2013 something they have pointedly refused to do so far \u2013 and that could lift expectations for hikes in 2018. The strong US employment data but modest wage growth backs the idea of gradual Federal Reserve rate hikes, says economist James Knightley at ING Bank: US employment has rebounded from hurricane related weakness, but wage growth is benign meaning the Fed trajectory on rate hikes remains on track. The US labour report for October has reversed the hurricane related distortions of the September release. Payrolls rose 261,000 versus the 313,000 consensus, but there were a net 90,000 upward revisions so on balance it is a strong report and backs the case for a December rate hike. If you remember, September\u2019s payrolls fell 33,000 (now reported as an 18,000 rise) largely because a significant number of people in affected areas couldn\u2019t get into work and therefore were not logged as being on the company payroll that day. This of course has unwound and on top of that we are seeing strong growth in the economy , which is creating jobs while post hurricane rebuilding and recovery work is likely to have added even more. The unemployment rate has surprisingly dropped a tenth of a percentage point and is now 4.1% - the lowest rate since December 2000. Average earnings growth has softened though, coming in flat on the month after a 0.5%MoM gain last month. This leaves pay at 2.4% YoY, which is a little disappointing. However, the fact that underemployment is now just 7.9% (down from 8.3% last month) really underlines how strong the jobs market is, meaning that the balance of risks must lie to the upside on wage growth from here. With the economy growing strongly and tax reform likely to add further fuel to the fire, the case for higher US interest rates continues to build. Barring an economically damaging government shutdown in early December we expect the Fed to hike rates on December 13 with at least two further rate rises probable under new Fed Chair Jerome Powell next year. Here\u2019s a link to the full jobs report: And here\u2019s the sector breakdown for the jobs data: Some of the hurricane related fall in September, notably in the leisure sector, seems to have been reversed in October. The Bureau of Labor Statistics says: Employment in food services and drinking places increased sharply, mostly offsetting a decline in September that largely reflected the impact of Hurricanes Irma and Harvey. In October, job gains also occurred in professional and business services, manufacturing, and health care. But Fidelity International\u2019s Anna Stupnytska believes the jobs figures are troubling for the Fed: The jobs news has sent both sterling and the euro to their highs of the day against the US dollar. But slightly weaker than expected data is unlikely to deter the US Federal Reserve from raising interest rates in December, analysts believe. Kully Samra, UK managing director at Charles Schwab, said: A rise in non-farm payroll numbers indicates that the labour market has largely brushed off hurricane-induced issues, paving the way for the Fed to hike rates in December. While some data points missed the mark, the ADP Employment Change Report showed private sector payrolls rose by 235,000 jobs in October, proving that the job market remains in fairly healthy shape with a strong bounce back in hiring from the previous disappointing month. Alongside robust job growth, third quarter earnings have been solid so far and economic growth has picked up. Along with new records being set by stocks, investor sentiment measures are demonstrating widespread optimism and the US economy has received a boost from expectations that tax reform and earnings will continue to fuel an updraft in the markets. On the earnings front, average hourly earnings were unchanged after expectations of a 0.2% rise month on month. The year on year figure fell from 2.8% in September to 2.4%, lower than the forecast 2.7% rise. The October US jobs number may have disappointed, but figures for the previous two months have been revised upwards. September saw an 18,000 increase compared to the initial estimate of a fall of 33,000. The August number is up from 169,000 to 208,000. Breaking News: The US added 261,000 jobs in October, rebounding strongly from the surprise fall the previous month in the wake of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. This compares to expectations of a rise of around 310,000. The jobless rate fell from 4.2% to 4.1%, slightly better than forecasts. Meanwhile the pound is picking up after the strong service sector numbers gave more credence to further UK interest rate rises, despite the Bank of England playing this down on Thursday. Sterling is currently up 0.26% at $1.3091 against the dollar and 0.36% better against the euro at \u20ac1.1239. Conversely this has seen the FTSE 100 lose much of the day\u2019s gains - the leading index is full of overseas earners which benefit from a weaker pound. The index is currently up just 0.02% at 7556.73 having earlier touched 7580. If it closes at this level it will still be a record high, but only just. The figure to beat is 7556.24. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: The headline payrolls figure could be huge; analysts have forecast a reading of 312k, a colossal step up from September\u2019s hurricane-hit -33k, and potentially the best number since the start of 2015. Elsewhere the jobs report isn\u2019t expected to be quite as strong, with an unchanged unemployment rate of 4.2% and a dip in wage growth from 0.5% to 0.2% month-on-month. The non-farm payrolls report is due at 12.30pm and is expected to show a strong rebound in jobs in October after major hurricane disruption triggered a sharp fall in September. Economists are expecting the report to show an additional 310,000 jobs were created, following a 33,000 drop a month earlier. Annual pay growth is expected to slip however, to 2.7% from 2.9%, with a monthly increase of 0.2% pencilled in, following 0.5% in September. The unemployment rate is expected to be unchanged at 4.2%. Fitch has said there will be no major economic impact from Thursday\u2019s rate rise, and are not expecting another one in the next 12 months. Fitch has for some time been expecting the post-referendum interest rate cut to be reversed, although in our most recent global economic outlook (September 2017), we expected this to happen in early 2018. The MPC summary said that all members agreed that future increases \u201cwould be expected to be at a gradual pace and to a limited extent,\u201d and that monetary policy \u201ccontinues to provide significant support to jobs and activity.\u201d We think another increase is unlikely in the next 12 months, given the impact of Brexit uncertainty on the outlook for investment. The decision does not alter our UK growth forecasts , which see a net trade boost partially offsetting slower domestic demand this year, enabling real GDP to rise by 1.5%, before slowing to 1.3% next year. But it remains to be seen how firms and households adjust to a shift in the monetary policy stance after such a long period without a rate rise. Alan Clarke, economist at Scotiabank, says the Bank of England might not wait a year before raising rates again, as many currently expect. He says the PMIs suggest the economy is on track to grow 0.5% in the fourth quarter, which would be the strongest rate of quarterly growth this year. Clarke adds: I think yesterday taught us that the MPC and particularly the doves want to see concrete signs that wages are picking up before pulling the trigger again. Nonetheless, if we get the fall in unemployment that I\u2019m expecting, confirmation of 0.5% growth in Q4, and signs of faster wages early in the new year, it\u2019s not going to be another year until the next hike. Howard Archer, chief economic advisor to the forecasting group, the EY ITEM Club, says the stronger-than-expected headline services PMI number (55.6) boost prospects for growth in the fourth quarter overall. The October services purchasing managers\u2019 survey showed activity improving significantly to a six-month high, thereby boosting fourth quarter growth hopes. October\u2019s rise marked the biggest monthly improvement in the index since August 2016. Overall, the October PMIs [including manufacturing and construction] suggest that the economy continued to improve gradually at the start of the fourth quarter after GDP growth improved modestly to 0.4% q/q in the third quarter from 0.3% in both the second and first quarters. Behind the headline number, the services PMI is a bit of a mixed bag. New business growth was the fastest since May, helped by more orders from the domestic market and successful new product launches according to the survey\u2019s respondents. Orders were also boosted in some cases by firms absorbing higher costs, rather than fully passing them on to customers. But jobs creation in the sector was the weakest in seven months, as companies became increasingly concerned about demand in the longer-term as a result of Brexit uncertainty. The sector accounts for about three quarters of the UK economy and includes restaurants and hotels, hairdressing, legal and accounting services, among other things Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey, explains the mixed messages coming from the October PMI. The latest PMI surveys bring mixed news on the economy. While an upturn in business activity growth adds some justification to the Bank of England\u2019s decision to hike interest rates for the first time in a decade, a deeper dive into the numbers highlights the fragility of the economy and points to downside risks for the outlook. A downturn in business optimism about the year ahead, fueled mainly by Brexit-related uncertainty, suggests that risks are tilted to the downside as far as future growth is concerned. Not surprisingly, employment growth slowed for a second successive month as the business mood grew more cautious and risk averse. Overall he says the services PMI - combined with equivalent surveys for the manufacturing and construction sectors - suggests quarterly growth of 0.5%, marking a decent start to Q4. (The economy grew by 0.4% in the third quarter.) Britain\u2019s services sector growth accelerated unexpectedly last month according to the IHS Markit/CIPS PMI survey. The headline index combining output, orders and employment rose to a six-month high of 55.6 in October, from 53.6 in September. Any number above 50 signals expansion, and economists had predicted slightly weaker growth at 53.3. This will be welcomed by Bank of England policymakers as a positive for the economy, strengthening their argument that the economy was ready for yesterday\u2019s rate rise, despite falling real wages which is putting pressure on household finances. The FTSE 100 is up 23 points this morning at 7,578.50, putting it on course for a new closing high. The number to beat is 7,556.24. The index is benefitting from a weaker pound, because so many of the companies listed have significant earnings abroad. Spain\u2019s Ibex is lagging the rest of Europe this morning, as political turmoil continues to weigh on investor sentiment. The scores so far this morning: FTSE 100: +0.3% at 7,578.50 Germany\u2019s DAX: +0.4% at 13,497.87 France\u2019s CAC: -0.01% at 5,509.95 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: +0.2% at 23,080.45 Spain\u2019s IBEX: -0.7% at 10,382.90 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: +0.1% at 395.5 Ben Broadbent\u2019s comments that the UK economy could withstand \u201ca couple more rate rises\u201d has done nothing to lift the pound. Having fallen 1.8 cents - or 1.3% - against the dollar on Thursday, to $1.3067, the pound has dipped further this morning to $1.3053. The fall suggests that as well as having already priced in the well trailed hike, markets are not convinced another one is coming any time soon. It has recovered some ground against the euro however, and is currently up 0.07% at \u20ac1.1207. Ben Broadbent, deputy governor for monetary policy at the Bank of England, has been elaborating this morning on Thursday\u2019s decision to raise rates for the first time in a decade. Commenting on the impact of the rise for UK households, he told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: There will be some [pain] and it\u2019s one part of how monetary policy works. Equally one should keep this in context. Around a third of households have owner-occupied mortgages, interest payments on debt - in aggregate - for households, are lower than they\u2019ve ever been, relative to income, and this is a moderate rise. One should also bear in mind there are people who derive income from deposits so you\u2019re right, but I think one should keep the scale of this in context. He added the Bank\u2019s current view is that two more rate hikes will be needed to bring inflation back to the 2% target: Given our outlook currently, we anticipate we\u2019ll need maybe a couple more rate rises to get inflation back on track, while at the same time supporting the economy. That is not a promise, and it never could be a promise. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It was momentous day for the UK yesterday, with the first rise in interest rates in a decade. The benchmark cost of borrowing was increased to 0.5% from 0.25%, reversing the cut implemented by the Bank in August last year in response to the Brexit vote. Ben Broadbent has admitted this morning that the hike will inflict pain on some households - those with standard variable rate mortgages - at time when real incomes are falling. But he insisted the rise was \u201cmoderate\u201d and said the economy could withstand a \u201ccouple more\u201d hikes in order to bring inflation back to the Bank\u2019s 2% target. Also coming up: 9.30am: The UK services PMI for October is expected to show growth in the sector (which accounts for about three-quarters of the economy) was broadly stable last month. 12.30: US non-farm payrolls report for October will reveal how well the jobs market bounced after taking a mighty hit from hurricane disruption in September",

Sterling valiantly tried to claw its way off the lows hit yesterday, after the swan-dive following the BoE news, but despite Ben Broadbent\u2019s best efforts to say \u2018no, we really do want to keep raising rates\u2019, the deputy governor failed to dispel the impression that the MPC will now sit on its hands and await developments.</p> <p> With over 80% of the S&amp;P 500 having reported, and 77% of them having beaten estimates, we are now into the scrag-end of earnings season. Overall the period has been firmly supportive of equity prices, even at their current elevated levels.</p> <p>With the coming week seeing a notable downturn in big-ticket corporate and economic events, equities will just have to get by on bullish momentum alone.

The (arguably more important) wage growth reading also came in worse than forecast, plunging from 0.5% to 0.0% month-on-month. Yet any disappointment was tempered by the unemployment rate, which fell to a 17 year low of 4.1%. Elsewhere an underperforming Markit services PMI, which arrived at 55.3 against the initial 55.9 estimate, was countered by a stellar ISM number, at 60.1 against the 59.8 forecast.</p> <p>After a bit of a wobble post-jobs report that ISM services PMI seemed to swing things in favour of the dollar, which rose 0.4% against the euro and 0.3% against the yen. Only against the pound did the greenback struggle, and even then it held onto almost all of Thursday\u2019s hefty gains. As for the Dow Jones, the index was pretty flat after the bell, though is still at a 23500-plus all-time high following Apple\u2019s Q4-inspired rise.</p> <p>Though the pound couldn\u2019t make any great inroads against the dollar, rising just 0.1%, against the euro it had more successful, climbing half a percent to re-cross \u20ac1.125. This helped erase the FTSE\u2019s early growth, meaning the UK index may struggle to close at the record high it was promising during the morning\u2019s trading.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-11-03T15:56:40.571Z\">at 3.56pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-59fc8998cf32fa0718a9efd5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-11-03T15:23:53.187Z\">3.23pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>There was more US data this afternoon, with better than expected factory goods orders.</p> <p>They rose by 1.4% in September, up from 1.2% in August and higher than the 1.3% increase forecast by economists.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59fc84bb9e4e3b0684a494be\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-11-03T15:01:29.035Z\">3.01pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>On the prospect of another Fed rate hike:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/jmoz62/status/926455112943505408\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Well there&#39;s a thought...courtesy <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Bloomberg?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Bloomberg</a> H/T <a href=\"https://twitter.com/zerohedge?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@zerohedge</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/L9RAGSThbe\">pic.twitter.com/L9RAGSThbe</a></p>&mdash; David Morrison (@jmoz62) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jmoz62/status/926455112943505408?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 3, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59fc7ee2cf32fa0718a9ef38\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-11-03T14:41:00.520Z\">2.41pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>On the Markit service sector survey, Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The services PMI survey highlights the dilemma facing the Fed as it seeks to determine the right policy course amid signs of solid growth but soft inflation.</p> <p>Together with the manufacturing PMI, which rose higher in October as hurricane-related supply chain disruptions eased, the latest services survey is consistent with underlying growth in the economy of approximately 3%, as well as buoyant jobs growth. </p> <p>With the data for October setting the scene for another robust GDP increase in the fourth quarter, a December rate hike is very much on the cards. </p> <p>However, a drop in inflationary pressures adds an element of uncertainty to the picture.

Barring an economically damaging government shutdown in early December we expect the Fed to hike rates on December 13 with at least two further rate rises probable under new Fed Chair Jerome Powell next year.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59fc6656e1f1970691236054\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-11-03T12:51:47.236Z\">12.51pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here\u2019s a link to the full jobs report:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BLS_gov/status/926426246581547008\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Payroll employment rises by 261,000 in October; unemployment rate edges down to 4.1% <a href=\"https://t.co/NsuHovcqn0\">https://t.co/NsuHovcqn0</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/JobsReport?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#JobsReport</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/BLSdata?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#BLSdata</a></p>&mdash; BLS-Labor Statistics (@BLS_gov) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BLS_gov/status/926426246581547008?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 3, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59fc65a2e1f197069123603d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-11-03T12:50:32.066Z\">12.50pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>And here\u2019s the sector breakdown for the jobs data:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e7b3b29a7553e2d0ea9523228991ce0018c00b9b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e7b3b29a7553e2d0ea9523228991ce0018c00b9b/0_0_1576_786/1000.jpg\" alt=\"moreusnonfarm\" width=\"1000\" height=\"499\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59fc6489e1f197069123602c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-11-03T12:46:44.669Z\">12.46pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Some of the hurricane related fall in September, notably in the leisure sector, seems to have been reversed in October.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Behind the closed doors of five-star hotels and Michelin-starred restaurants, campaigning has begun in one of the world\u2019s most secretive elections. Candidates are not allowed to officially campaign, are prevented from submitting a manifesto and nearly all of the voters earn at least $1m a year. Welcome to the race to become the next managing partner of McKinsey &amp; Company, the world\u2019s largest management consultancy firm which provides very expensive advice to multinational companies and governments across the world. While McKinsey advises its clients that transparency is \u201cthe most important driver\u201d of improved performance, the consultancy firm refused to answer any questions about the process by which its partners are electing their new leader. The election, which informally began at the five-star Grosvenor House Hotel on Park Lane last month and will not conclude until the spring, is so secretive and archaic that its described it as similar to the conclave to elect a new Pope \u2013 bar the white smoke. Whoever wins will become one of the best-connected people in the world. Dominic Barton, the current managing partner, meets two chief executive or government leaders every day and is on a plane 240 days a year. His hectic schedule, he says, gives him \u201ca unique perspective on what matters to companies, governments, and non-profits the world over\u201d. The new boss will also have to manage a lot of giant egos within the firm, which is owned by its partners and has been compared to the US marines, the Jesuits, the Roman army and a corporate Mandarin elite. \u201cOur firm is full of leaders,\u201d Barton, who known as Dom to his colleagues, said. \u201cAs managing director I set themes, make connections, and drive forward initiatives that will advance our ability to serve our clients, strengthen our firm, and develop our people.\u201d Duff McDonald, who describes the company as the \u201csingle greatest legitimiser of mass lay-offs \u2026 in modern history\u201d in The Firm, his investigative book on McKinsey, said partners openly refer to themselves as \u201cthe greatest collection of talent the world has ever seen\u201d. He reports one partner stating that: \u201cThere are only three great institutions left in the world: the marines, the Catholic Church and McKinsey.\u201d The vote comes as McKinsey, which employs 29,000 people in 65 countries, is embroiled in the \u201cstate capture\u201d controversy in South Africa. McKinsey is being investigated over allegations of bribery and corruption in relation to work it carried out for friends of the president, Jacob Zuma. It is the biggest crisis to hit the firm since former managing partner Rajat Gupta was jailed for insider dealing. McKinsey denies the bribery allegations, but has admitted \u201cviolations of our professional standards\u201d and apologised to the people of South Africa. Tom Barkin, its global chief risk officer, said the firm was \u201cembarrassed\u201d that work with a company linked to South Africa\u2019s controversial billionaire Gupta family (no relation to Rajat Gupta) \u201cfell short of our standards\u201d. Despite the denial and apology, McKinsey was this week dropped by two of its biggest South African clients \u2013 Barclays Africa and Standard Bank \u2013 as public pressure mounts on all those involved in the scandal, which has already led to the collapse of public relations firm Bell Pottinger. At a series of recent meetings and dinners arranged for partners to begin the selection to find a replacement for Barton, the South African scandal and its impact on the firm\u2019s fiercely guarded reputation was the main topic of conversation. None of the early rumoured frontrunners to replace Barton, who will have led McKinsey for the maximum permitted three three-year terms, are from the South African office or linked to the scandal. The runners and riders are said to include: Vivian Hunt, managing partner of the UK and Ireland; Gary Pinkus, managing partner for north America; Kevin Sneader, chairman of the Asia-Pacific; and Bob Sternfels, head of global functions. The nomination process will formally begin in January when partners each select seven candidates in their preferred order. All of McKinsey\u2019s senior partners can be selected bar those over age 57 or planning to retire. The results of the first round will narrow the field to 10. A second round of voting in February will whittle the field down to a face-off, with the winner announced in March and taking up the position in July 2018. It\u2019s not known how much money the managing partner or any other partner gets paid as McKinsey does not publish any financial figures, but Gupta was reportedly paid $6m a year. \u201cIt really is the most unusual and secretive appointment process in the business,\u201d said Matthew Gwyther, the recently departed editor of Management Today. \u201cThey keep the whole process very secret, it\u2019s almost a papal conclave without the smoke coming up at the end. McKinsey is more secretive than that. \u201cThey\u2019re secretive in everything they do, which from a journalistic point of view makes them maddening as they very rarely talk about anything. The most you get is the McKinsey Quarterly magazine.\u201d The magazine is not exactly a page-turner: the lead story in the most recent edition is about how \u201ca combination of survey data, sophisticated statistical analysis, and modelling\u201d explains the importance of digitisation. In his column in the latest issue, Barton says companies need a \u201cnew playbook\u201d on gender equality as companies fail to recruit enough women to high-level jobs. \u201cThe old [playbook] isn\u2019t working,\u201d he says. \u201cWe need bolder leadership and more exacting execution.\u201d His comments on gender equality, which include the admission that McKinsey itself is finding it hard to make \u201cdeep and lasting progress\u201d, has focused attention on Hunt. She is the firm\u2019s lead speaker on how increasing diversity can improve companies\u2019 performance. Hunt, who is an African American with dual British and American citizenship, is serially published on the topic including reports titled Women Matter, Diversity Matters, and The power of Parity: How advancing women\u2019s equality can add $12tn to global growth. Hunt, who has been named one of the 10 most influential black people in Britain by the Powerlist Foundation, serves on the board of the CBI London council and the mayor of London\u2019s business advisory board and advises the Tate Modern, the Southbank Centre and Teach First. Gwyther said the fight for the top job is expected to be brutal as McKinsey\u2019s partners \u201creally are the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me of the business world, and my God do they believe in themselves\u201d. He said they\u2019re right to an extent. \u201cThey really do get the best students from the best universities and the best of the crop of the business schools.\u201d The firm receives nearly 100 applications for each place on its yearly intake. But securing a place does not mean a McKinsey career for life: the firm operates a brutal \u201cup or out\u201d policy with a turnover rate of about 25%. It is suggested that if recruits do not make partner within five or six years, they might want to try their luck elsewhere. Barton though is an exception, having failed to make the grade at his first two attempts at partner. Once firmly in place, partners stay McKinsey-ites even after leaving the firm. Former partners \u2013 who populate boardrooms and parliaments across the world \u2013 are known to still refer to themselves and their former colleagues as \u201cwe\u201d. The firm is often the first port of call for expensive advice when ex-McKinsey people get a new top job, including Mark Carney, who asked the firm to review the Bank\u2019s operations shortly after he was appointed governor. Other alumni include Vittorio Colao, the chief executive of Vodafone; Sheryl Sandberg, chief operating officer at Facebook; Tidjane Thiam, the chief executive of Credit Suisse; Lord Green; Lord Turner; William Hague; and Chelsea Clinton. Not surprising then that Barton refers to the firm as a \u201cleadership factory\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "TV and mobile mast owner Arqiva and Bakkav\u00f6r, one of the biggest providers of ready meals to British supermarkets, have both pulled plans to float on the London stock exchange citing concerns over the volatility of the market. Arqiva \u2013 which just last week announced plans for a \u00a36bn flotation, in what would have been the UK\u2019s largest stock market listing so far this year \u2013 said it intended to \u201cpostpone\u201d its initial public offering until UK market conditions improve. \u201cThe board and shareholders have decided that pursuing a listing in this period of IPO market uncertainty is not in the interests of the company and its stakeholders, and will revisit the listing once IPO market conditions improve,\u201d said Arqiva, which carried the BBC\u2019s first TV broadcast in 1936 and is an investor in the YouView TV platform. Bakkav\u00f6r, which provides fresh prepared food from salad and pizza to stir fries as own-brand products to clients including Tesco, Marks &amp; Spencer, Sainsbury\u2019s and Waitrose, announced plans for a \u00a31.7bn flotation last month. The company, the UK\u2019s biggest supplier of hummus, had been expected to put a price on its shares on Friday morning. \u201cWhilst the company received sufficient institutional demand to cover the offering, the board has taken the decision that proceeding with the transaction would not be in the best interests of the company, or its shareholders, given the current volatility in the IPO market,\u201d the company said. \u201cBakkav\u00f6r will continue to pursue its proven strategy within the fast-growing fresh prepared food sector. The business continues to trade well and against this backdrop, the board remains confident in the outlook for the group.\u201d In April, the company was at the centre of the UK \u201chummus crisis\u201d after the mass withdrawal of the product from British supermarket shelves after customers complained of a metallic taste. The pulling of the flotation plans raise fresh fears about London\u2019s status as a top destination for initial public offerings, the pace of which has slowed following the UK\u2019s vote to leave the European Union. Last month, TMF Group, the Dutch business outsourcer, abandoned plans for a \u00a31bn float in London and move its headquarters to the UK in favour of going private in a \u20ac1.75bn (\u00a31.55bn) deal with private equity firm CVC. The firm had positioned its proposed listing in London as a \u201cvote of confidence for the UK\u201d. Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska\u2019s energy business En+ has priced its forthcoming flotation at the bottom of the price range it had announced. TI Fluid Systems, the car parts maker, floated for \u00a31.5bn last week, having previously pulled plans following the Brexit vote.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The US economy bounced back in October from a dramatic slump in hiring in the wake of two devastating hurricanes, the labor department announced on Friday. The US added 261,000 new jobs and the unemployment rate ticked down to 4.1%. In September the US shed 30,000 jobs \u2013 the first loss in seven years \u2013 as hurricanes Harvey and Irma held back hiring in Texas and Florida. The leisure and hospitality industry was hardest hit by the hurricanes in September, shedding 111,000 jobs. Employment in food services and drinking places rose sharply in October \u2013 up 89,000 \u2013 following a decrease of 98,000 in September. October\u2019s figure was still lower than analysts had expected, perhaps reflecting the continued impact of the storms. September was the second month of disappointing growth in the US jobs market. The labor department had calculated that the US had added 169,000 new positions in August, below the 180,000 that had been expected by economists. But the figures from August and September have now been revised up, to 208,000 and 18,000 respectively. And at 4.1% the unemployment rate is now at lows unseen since December 2000. \u201cJOBS, JOBS, JOBS!\u201d president Donald Trump tweeted shortly after the figures were released. Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics, said that while October\u2019s figure was not as robust as had been expected, the revisions to the two previous months may have accounted for the lower number. \u201cNevertheless, that still means employment increased by a relatively modest 140,000 per month over the past two months, which is a significant slowdown on the pace of employment growth in the first half of this year,\u201d he said. Wage growth, which has been slow since the recession, stalled in October. Average hourly earnings fell by one cent in October to $26.53 an hour. Economists had expected a slight monthly gain. The release of October\u2019s figures comes a day after Trump announced a new tax plan that he has pledged will create more jobs in the US. The plan, which will deliver big cuts for business and the wealthy, as well as more modest cuts for the middle class, will provide \u201cthe rocket fuel our economy needs to soar higher than ever before\u201d, Trump said. On Wednesday, ADP, the private payroll supplier, said the private sector added 235,000 positions in October. Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody\u2019s Analytics, which helps compile the report, said: \u201cThe job market rebounded strongly from the hit it took from Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. Resurgence in construction jobs shows the rebuilding is already in full swing. Looking through the hurricane-created volatility, job growth is robust.\u201d The solid rise in jobs is likely to confirm plans by the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates at its next meeting in December. On Thursday, Trump appointed Fed board member Jerome Powell as the next chair of the central bank. He will replace Janet Yellen when her term ends in February.",

      "bodyText": "Shares in Playtech, the company behind the software powering thousands of fixed-odds betting terminals and Sun Bingo, have fallen 20% after it issued a profit warning. The company said it expects to miss profit forecasts, blaming problems including a setback with its contract to provide software for Sun Bingo, a gambling website owned by Rupert Murdoch\u2019s News UK. The firm blamed technical problems moving the website on to its own software platform, after winning the contract to run the newspaper\u2019s bingo business in 2015. It also blamed \u201clengthier seasonality\u201d, which it defined as suffering quieter periods due to the weather. Although Playtech makes FOBT softwares, it did not comment on the recent government review, which concluded that the maximum stake should be reduced from \u00a3100, potentially to as low as \u00a32. Clients include William Hill, which is also likely to suffer a drop in revenues if FOBT stakes are slashed. Playtech also noted a slowdown in Asia due to \u201crecent changing market conditions\u201d, a reference to recent restrictions on online gaming in Malaysia, one of its major markets. The firm said it has given up hope of any improvement this year and warned that Asia\u2019s contribution to revenue would \u201cconsistently reduce over time\u201d. The company expects annual profitto fall 5% below the bottom end of market expectations. The company, which also makes gambling games themed around The Flintstones and comic book characters such as Batman, said in August it expected a \u201cstrong performance in 2017\u201d. But shares in the firm, founded by the Israeli billionaire Teddy Sagi, dropped more than 20% after the profit warning, cutting its stock market value by nearly \u00a3650m. It was the biggest faller on the FTSE 250. Sagi, one of Israel\u2019s richest men, has banked more than \u00a3780m by selling his shares in the firm over the past year, as he looks to fund a move into real estate investment.
