      "bodyText": "John Lewis is to axe nearly 800 jobs in its customer restaurants and store administration in its biggest ever round of redundancies. The department store chain said it was consulting 773 people about redundancy as it attempts to cut costs and become more efficient. The cuts are the first sign of change since the department store\u2019s managing director, Paula Nickolds, took the helm in late January. The cuts come just weeks after Waitrose, John Lewis\u2019s sister company, revealed plans to close six stores and remove a level of management in its supermarkets, putting nearly 700 jobs at risk. John Lewis said it planned to centralise the administration behind its curtain and carpet estimating and fitting services, moving jobs out of stores to its office in Didsbury, Manchester. It is also axing chefs, as it switches away from preparing food at in-store cafes in favour of having ready-made dishes delivered by external suppliers. The retailer said it would offer workers alternative roles, but the majority of those affected by the changes are expected to leave. It will create 386 jobs in the new central administration hub and in cafe customer service roles. Carpet estimators and fitters will not be affected by the job cuts but will now work for customers who buy online and from the high street outlets. In an effort to reduce costs, the group shut some staff canteens about a year ago and introduced longer shifts for delivery drivers. The new job cuts are the biggest since 2009 when 700 in-store call centre employees were made redundant, and will be a blow to John Lewis\u2019s benign, paternalistic image. The changes come amid falling profits at the department store group. Operating profits slumped 31% despite a 4.5% rise in sales in the six months to the end of July as the company invested heavily in equipment to support its online business and increasing pay for staff. The John Lewis group \u2013 which includes Waitrose \u2013 said last month its annual bonus for staff, known as \u201cpartners\u201d because they own the company collectively, would fall significantly this year and that staff numbers would drop after operating profits dived 58.3% to \u00a3113.7m in the six months to the end of July. Last year the staff bonus \u2013 which is the same percentage of salary for all workers, from the chairman to Saturday shelf-fillers \u2013 was 10%, the lowest for 13 years. This year\u2019s lower bonus will be unveiled on 9 March, along with the retailer\u2019s annual results. Dino Rocos, operations director at John Lewis, said: \u201cOur partners are passionate about offering the very best customer service and these proposals will allow us to modernise our business as it adapts to the changing needs of our customers and the role that shops play in their lives. \u201cThe proposed new structure will allow us to harness partners\u2019 knowledge and skills, giving them more scope to be in the right place at the right time to deliver great service to our customers when and where it\u2019s needed. We understand that for some this will mean a period of change, and we are working with affected partners over the consultation period to give opportunities for redeployment in new roles wherever possible.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Despite the positive German GDP data and a slight easing of concerns about the French presidential election, investors were in a more cautious mood all round. So most European markets slipped back, while US shares struggled for direction for a while before resuming their record breaking run. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 30.88 points or 0.42% at 7271.37 Germany\u2019s Dax dipped 0.42% to 11,947.83 France\u2019s Cac closed down 0.09% at 4891.29 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 0.35% to 18,819.49 But Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 0.17% at 9493.4 And in Greece, the Athens market added 0.37% to 649.52 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 54 points at 20,829 having earlier touched a new peak of 20,835. On that note, it\u2019s time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Over in Greece,. and finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos has said that new concessions the government has agreed to make in return for further bailout loans will not be without cost. The warning came as IMF chief Christine Lagarde also warned that Greece will have to reform before debt relief can be discussed. Our correspondent Helena Smith reports from Athens: Making his first public intervention since Monday\u2019s eurogroup meeting, Euclid Tsakalotos said it was inevitable that pre-legislation of further pension and income tax measures would bring pain for some and gain for others. \u201cSome may lose out but some will gain,\u201d he told the Greek parliament this afternoon. \u201cSome who we do not assist at present \u2013 and we should help them - will gain,\u201d he said. But he nsisted that the reforms would be \u201cfiscally neutral\u201d because they would have no \u201cnet\u201d fiscal impact. Low-income taxpayers who looked set to suffer once the reforms were enforced as of January 2019 would get something else in return, he said. Tsakalotos had been roundly criticised for not addressing the public in the wake of the Monday\u2019s eurogroup where the government, under mounting pressure to resume stalled bailout negotiations, was perceived to have caved in to demands for further measures. Following talks with the German chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin, the IMF\u2019s Christine Lagarde said it was now incumbent on Athens to implement the reforms if the IMF was to sign up to the programme. \u201cObviously, the second leg is going to be the level of debt that the country can carry out and that debt will have to be restructured appropriately and the volume of restructuring will clearly depend how much reform, how much progress, how strong the Greek economy is at the end of the program,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat will be needed is not a haircut if the reforms are done but a significant extension of maturity, a significant interest rate capping and that will have to be discussed in greater details later on as progress is made on the reform front.\u201d Stock markets appear to be pausing for breath, with all the major indices - including the Dow - in negative territory. The FTSE 100 was among the weaker markets, with a strong pound taking the shine off dollar earners and Barclays reversing earlier gains. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: With the pound having a strong afternoon - ....gains against the dollar joined by a 0.6% rise against the euro \u2013 the FTSE completely lost its way as the session wrapped up, tumbling around half a percent. The index wasn\u2019t helped by the reversal of Barclays\u2019 earlier growth; the bank, which announced this morning that it had nearly trebled its annual profit year-on-year, shifted from a 3.5% rise to a 3% loss, investors displeased at the cautious tone and conduct charge-littered outlook outlined by the bank in its full year statement. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: It finally looks as if the downside is getting some traction across markets, with the FTSE 100 breaking lower and US markets posting small losses in the early part of the session. It is probably too early to announce the demise of the rally, but at some point something had to give, and in recent days it had become clear that the risk appetite that was so unstoppable a week ago had given way to nervous selling. US crude stocks rose by less than expected last week, helping to support the rise in oil prices. Brent is currently up 2% at $57.02 a barrel. Mnuchin also talked about issuing long-term - up to 100 year - bonds. Quick: There were some market speculation yesterday that you might today announce plans for a longer term Treasury bond, a 50-year and 100-year bond because of just that, interest rates being low right now. Have you given that serious thought, and is that something we should expect to see? I\u2019ve said this before. We\u2019re in the going to make a formal -- we\u2019re not ready to make any formal announcement on whether we\u2019re going to have a 50-year or 100-year. I have said this before. I think it\u2019s something that we should seriously look at. I\u2019ve already begun to talk to the staff about looking at that. Again, we\u2019ll reach out to the market, investors, different people, but I think it\u2019s something that is a very serious issue of whether we should explore, whether we can raise 50 or 100-year money at a very slight premium. That\u2019s something that makes sense for Treasury to look at. Donald Trump of course said he would label China a currency manipulator, and Mnuchin is asked about this. Quick: Is it fair to say you\u2019re not going to be naming China a currency manipulator any time soon? Again, what\u2019s fair to say is, first of all, I\u2019ve had a terrific conversation with my counterparts there. I look forward to meeting them. We have a process within Treasury where we go through and look at currency manipulation across the board. We\u2019ll go through that process. We\u2019ll do that as we have in the past. We\u2019re not making any judgments until we continue that process. Here\u2019s some of the full quotes from Becky Quick CNBC\u2019s interview with the new US Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin. First, on the tax plan mentioned by Donald Trump ( the \u201cphenomenal\u201d tax plan at that). He said: Let me first say that our economic agenda, the number one issue is growth and the first, most important thing that will impact growth is a tax plan. So we are committed to pass tax reform. It will be very significant. It\u2019s going to be focused on middle income tax cuts, simplification, and making the business tax competitive with the rest of the world, which has been a big problem and a lot of reasons why companies are leaving and cash is sitting offshore. So that\u2019s really our focus. We want to get this done by the August recess. we\u2019ve been working closely with the leadership in the house and the senate, and we\u2019re working on a combined plan. On getting US economic growth back to 3%: I think it\u2019s very achievable. If you look at long-term growth, we have underperformed where we need to be. We believe we can be competitive and get back to sustainable growth at 3% or more. There\u2019s going to be a lot of things that will impact it. I think the first issue, as I mentioned, is going to be tax reform. I think the other issue is going to be regulatory relief. we need to cut back regulations that have prevented small and medium-sized businesses from being the engine of growth in this country. We\u2019re also focused, as you know, on Dodd-Frank and looking at Dodd-Frank and making sure banks can lend. There\u2019s an incredible amount of liquidity out there. We want to make sure that banks put it to work. Quick: If we stick to your time frame and we see something passed before the August recess, do you think -- we\u2019ve already seen regulatory reform start. Do you think we\u2019d see 3% plus GDP by next year? I think it\u2019s going to take time to get there. So i think it would be, you know, more towards the end -- seeing the growth towards the end of next year. I think by the time we pass tax reform, you see the impact on the economy, you see the impact of regulation, it\u2019s definitely going to take into next year to see an engine of growth. Quick: Obviously a lot of people are looking at this, the Fed and the CDO, and their growth projections are closer to 1.8%. What are they missing? They don\u2019t see any of this? I don\u2019t think they\u2019re missing anything. I think they\u2019re making those projections based on the status quo. That\u2019s where the economy has been. It\u2019s been actually lower than that under the Obama administration. And i think we\u2019re looking at significant economic changes...We have a great economic team, and we\u2019re going to put forth policies that are going to really create growth in this country. The full video is here. It\u2019s become a daily event, but US markets have opened at new peaks once more. A rally in oil prices and continuing hopes of a increased spending and cuts in taxes from the Trump administration are keeping investors in an optimistic mood. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has climbed 49 points to 20,824 while the S&amp;P 500 opened up 0.2% and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.04%. Growth in emerging markets and a reasonable performance from developed countries will see the global economy expand this year, according to a report from Moody\u2019s. The agency says the outlook could however be affected by US policy shifts under the new administration, notably on trade and immigration. Overall Moody\u2019s says the average rate of growth in G20 countries is expected to rise from 2.6% in 2016 to 3% this year and in 2018. Emerging markets are expected to grow by 4.8% this year and advanced economies by 1.9%. The UK is the only G20 European country where Moody\u2019s expects growth to slow significantly, from 1.8% in 2016 (as revealed this week) to around 1% in 2017, as the country negotiates its exit from the EU. As for the eurozone, Moody\u2019s has lifted its growth forecast for Germany to 1.6% in 2017 and 2018, up from 1.5% and 1.4% respectively. The risk for Europe is that anti-establishment parties make meaningful gains in elections this year, it said. Madhavi Bokil, a Vice President and Senior Analyst at Moody\u2019s, said: \u201cThe big economic risk with such an outcome, is that it could lead to anyof these countries potentially leaving the euro area. That could result in a resurgence of the European crisis.\u201d The biggest risk to the global economy is that a protectionist shift in the US could damage global trade and the economic recovery. Back in the UK, and shares in Barclays have lost all their early gains and are now down more than 3%, making them one of the biggest fallers in the FTSE 100. The turnaround in sentiment comes as analysts re-assess the prospect of further fines for the bank, which has taken the shine off the news that it had tripled full year profits. Michael Hewson at CMC Markets said: The bank has yet to settle with US authorities after rejecting an offer to settle a mis-selling claim for mortgage backed securities at the end of last year, which could provide a sting in the tail later this year. This is because Deutsche and Credit Suisse settled for $7.2bn and $5.3bn respectively, which might suggest that any potential future settlement is likely to be of a similarly high amount. Some early reaction to the US jobless claims. Paul Sirani, chief market analyst at Xtrade, said: Today\u2019s slight uptick in initial jobless claims isn\u2019t too drastic, especially as many were suggesting the number of people out of work for the first time would be much higher. Overall, the US labor market remains pretty tight. Donald Trump won\u2019t be too concerned by the slight rise, despite him placing jobs at the heart of his successful run for presidency. Anything around the 250,000 mark would suggest that the jobs market remains in good health. America is enjoying a two-year spell under the 300,000 mark \u2013 the longest since 1970 \u2013 but the real test for Trump and the economy in general is delivering substantive wage growth and quickly. Just in: The number of American signing on for unemployment benefit has risen, but remains low historically. Some 244,000 people filed an \u2018initial claim\u2019 last week, up from 238,000. That\u2019s 3,000 more than expected. Even so, these jobless claims figures suggests the US labour marker remains firm. Germany\u2019s ambassador to the UK, Peter Ammon, is tweeting about today\u2019s growth report. Donald Trump\u2019s administration are aiming to pass a \u201cvery significant\u201d tax reform plan by the summer. That\u2019s according to America\u2019s new Treasury Secretary, Stephen Mnuchin. Speaking on CNBC a few minute ago, Mnuchin said. We\u2019re primarily focused on a middle income tax cut, and simplification for business. He also promised that the administration will make sure that high-end earners don\u2019t get a free ride. If they also benefit from tax cuts, this will be \u201coffset with reduction of deductions\u201d (ie, refunds). Mnuchin also tried to play down the idea that the US might label China a currency manipulator, saying he\u2019ll keep his council until the Treasury has made an official assessment. I\u2019ve had a terrific conversation with my counterparts there. I look forward to meeting them. https://twitter.com/nasoskook/status/834736369519976448 Here\u2019s a killer line from Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight, on today\u2019s UK retail sales figures, illustrating the problem facing the UK as the post-referendum recovery peters out. The squeeze on consumers looks set to deepen markedly over the coming months as inflation likely heads towards 3% and pay growth is limited. There are many in the retail industry who believe that intense competition among supermarkets and the big high street chains will keep prices lower than expected as firms take the hit to profits rather than pass on input price rises. But still, the higher costs of IT equipment, imported cars and domestic appliances will be hard to avoid. The impact could be to encourage substitution, which means consumers buying cheaper alternatives, or not buying at all and delaying purchases until prices have settled again. Or it could mean they simply fork out the extra cost and cut back spending elsewhere. Either way, it will slow overall activity in the economy and depress GDP growth. Economist Sam Tombs reckons Britain\u2019s retailers are right to be pessimistic about prospects for 2017. He writes: The failure of the CBI\u2019s reported sales balance to recover significantly after its plunge in January provides more evidence that a consumer slowdown is under way. February\u2019s +9 reading is a clear margin below its +18 average in the previous four years when consumer spending boomed. The increase in sales volumes also was driven by the clothing sector, which perhaps benefited temporarily from unusually warm weather this month. Just in: British retail sales have picked up this month....but shop owners are increasingly worried about the future The CBI\u2019s latest \u2018distributive trades\u2019 survey found that 40% of retailers enjoyed a rise in sales volumes this month, compared to February 2016, while 31% saw them fall. That gives a balance of +9%, up from an 8% decline in January. But the deeper picture is less encouraging. The CBI also found that a majority of retailers expect the business situation to deteriorate over the next three months -- the worst reading in four years. Around 42% of retailers cited rising cost pressures as a factor driving the deterioration in the business situation, with 35% citing uncertainty over the Brexit/EU negotiations. This chart shows how rising costs are hitting most retailers: Ben Jones, CBI Principal Economist, says: \u201cThe rebound in retail sales suggests that some of the recent gloom about a slump in consumer demand at the start of 2017 may be overdone. \u201cHowever, retailers remain cautious about their prospects, expecting fairly tepid growth in sales volumes next month against a backdrop of rising inflation that is likely to erode households\u2019 purchasing power through the course of the year. \u201cAs the impact of the weaker pound feeds through supply chains, retailers are trying to absorb some of the increase in their import costs through savings.\u201d Shares in Barclays have risen by over 3% this morning after the bank nearly tripled its profits last year. The bank has admitted, though, that it still has some problems -- including legal battles over its conduct before, during and after the financial crisis. City editor Jill Treanor explains: The bank \u2013 which has been scrambling to repair its reputation since the 2012 Libor rate-fixing scandal \u2013 is fighting the US Department of Justice over a decade-old mortgage bond mis-selling scandal and awaiting the outcome of an investigation by the UK\u2019s Serious Fraud Office into the way it raised funds during the height of the banking crisis. Here\u2019s Jill\u2019s take: Some City analysts are underwhelmed by the results too, as underlying profits in the UK fell. City AM has a round-up of reaction. There\u2019s an eerie calm in the financial markets today (quite at odds with the gusts blasting between the City skyscrapers as Doris passes through). The FTSE 100 is up just 3 points, dragged down by budget airline easyJet (down 5% after going \u2018ex-dividend\u2019 this morning). Other European markets are also dull; even Germany\u2019s DAX only managed a 0.1% rise. As Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says, it\u2019s all rather muter.... The UK index lazed about under 7300 after the bell, once again failing to substantially break through that resistance level. There wasn\u2019t much excitement from the pound either, sterling sitting flat-ish at 1.245 against the dollar while flirting with 1.18 against the euro. After the mood-dampening, if superficially impressive, GDP reading yesterday the UK doesn\u2019t have anything to deal with this morning, explaining the rather snooze-worthy start to the session. A year ago, Stephen Hester, the former boss of Royal Bank of Scotland who now runs insurance company RSA, was one of 36 CEOs who signed a letter warning about the impact of Brexit on the business and the wider UK economy. So we reminded him about it today, as RSA reported its latest financial results. Hester says.... \u201cWe didn\u2019t think Brexit was the right economic course for the UK and we thought the UK would be poorer. I think the UK will be fine but it won\u2019t be as well off as it might otherwise have been.\u201d Turning to RSA, the owner of the More Than brand, Hester brushed off concerns. About 70% of profits are made outside the UK so they are boosted by the weaker pound once they are translated into sterling. He noted that the company\u2019s European subsidiaries are separately run and locally regulated, and RSA does not rely on passporting rights which allow banks to operate freely across the EU, while having most of their operations in the UK. RSA reported better than expected annual operating profits of \u00a3655m, up 25%, due to a record underwriting profit of \u00a3380m. Hester has spent the last three years selling off under-performing businesses, including in Latin America and Russia last year, and said RSA was now a \u201cturned around company\u201d focused on becoming \u201cbest in class for our markets\u201d. RSA shares were the second-biggest riser on the FTSE 100 in early trading, up more than 4% to 602p. Over in the markets, French government bonds are recovering as worries over the presidential election abate. A little. Traders are buying French debt after centrist politician Francois Bayrou threw his weight behind Emmanuel Macron yesterday, which could strengthen him in the battle against far-right leader Marine Le Pen. This means the gap between French and German borrowing costs has narrowed, having hit its widest level since 2012 earlier this week. However.... the latest polls show Le Pen extending her lead..... Not only is Germany outpacing its rivals, it is also racking up a record budget surplus. New figures show that Germany ran a net surplus of \u20ac23.7bn last year, which is the highest surplus achieved since reunification in 19990. This is only going to fuel the debate over Germany\u2019s impact on its neighbours, especially those eurozone countries struggling to bring their deficits down. Britain\u2019s looming departure from the European Union doesn\u2019t appear to have caused Germany\u2019s economy any grief. As in the UK, German consumers have taken geopolitical uncertainty in their stride. Today\u2019s report shows that household final consumption expenditure increased by 1.5%, in 2016 as a whole, and by 0.3% in the last quarter of the year. Bloomberg\u2019s Carolynn Look has a good take: Germany\u2019s performance in the fourth quarter suggests the economy is sturdy enough to cope with challenges that may arise from national elections, Brexit, and a more protectionist U.S. administration. Unemployment is at a record low and business confidence is rising, and the Bundesbank has cited a \u201cvery dynamic\u201d order intake as a factor driving future momentum. The economic situation in Germany in 2016 was \u201ccharacterised by solid and steady growth\u201d, says statistics body DeStatis. Economist Claus Vistesen of Pantheon Economics believes Germany probably grew faster than estimated in the last quarter. He disputes the idea that imports surged much more than exports (3.1%, vs 1.8%) It\u2019s official: Germany was the fastest growing major economy last year. Germany has wrestled the crown off Britain this morning, with new figures confirming that German GDP rose by 1.9% in 2016. That beats Britain, which only grew by 1.8% over the same period (as we learned yesterday), and means Westminster politicians won\u2019t be able to crow about beating the rest of the G7 last year. It also means Germany outpaced the US (which expanded by 1.6% last year, according to preliminary data). In the final three months of the year, Germany grew by 0.4% - recovering from a slowdown to just +0.1% in July-September. German government spending drove the economy, rising by 0.8% in the last quarter. That\u2019s partly the cost of housing and integrating refugees from have arrived in the country over the last couple of years. Household spending also boosted growth, rising by 0.3% in the last quarter. ING\u2019s Carsten Brzeski fears that this means the growth isn\u2019t sustainable... Net trade had a negative effect on growth in the last quarter, though - as imports rose by 3.1% while exports increased by 1.8%. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Coming up today... We\u2019ll be looking at Germany this morning, as updated growth figures for Europe\u2019s largest economy are released. We\u2019ll also have an eye on France, as its presidential election race unnerves the markets. British bank Barclays are publishing their results for the last financial year; pre-tax profits have trebled to \u00a31.74bn. At 11am, the CBI publishes its latest \u2018distributive trades\u2019 survey of retail sales in Britain. Eyes will be peeled for signs that UK consumers are cutting back, as inflation picks up. And later on, we get the weekly US jobless report (1.30pm GMT) and the latest oil inventory stats (4pm GMT).",

He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Let me first say that our economic agenda, the number one issue is growth and the first, most important thing that will impact growth is a tax plan. So we are committed to pass tax reform. It will be very significant. It\u2019s going to be focused on middle income tax cuts, simplification, and making the business tax competitive with the rest of the world, which has been a big problem and a lot of reasons why companies are leaving and cash is sitting offshore. So that\u2019s really our focus.</p> <p>We want to get this done by the August recess. we\u2019ve been working closely with the leadership in the house and the senate, and we\u2019re working on a combined plan.</p> </blockquote> <p>On getting US economic growth back to 3%:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think it\u2019s very achievable. If you look at long-term growth, we have underperformed where we need to be. We believe we can be competitive and get back to sustainable growth at 3% or more. There\u2019s going to be a lot of things that will impact it. I think the first issue, as I mentioned, is going to be tax reform. I think the other issue is going to be regulatory relief. we need to cut back regulations that have prevented small and medium-sized businesses from being the engine of growth in this country. We\u2019re also focused, as you know, on Dodd-Frank and looking at Dodd-Frank and making sure banks can lend. There\u2019s an incredible amount of liquidity out there. We want to make sure that banks put it to work.</p> </blockquote> <p>Quick: <em>If we stick to your time frame and we see something passed before the August recess, do you think -- we\u2019ve already seen regulatory reform start. Do you think we\u2019d see 3% plus GDP by next year?</em></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> I think it\u2019s going to take time to get there. So i think it would be, you know, more towards the end -- seeing the growth towards the end of next year. I think by the time we pass tax reform, you see the impact on the economy, you see the impact of regulation, it\u2019s definitely going to take into next year to see an engine of growth.</p> </blockquote> <p>Quick: <em>Obviously a lot of people are looking at this, the Fed and the CDO, and their growth projections are closer to 1.8%. What are they missing? They don\u2019t see any of this?</em></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I don\u2019t think they\u2019re missing anything. I think they\u2019re making those projections based on the status quo. That\u2019s where the economy has been. It\u2019s been actually lower than that under the Obama administration. And i think we\u2019re looking at significant economic changes...We have a great economic team, and we\u2019re going to put forth policies that are going to really create growth in this country. </p> </blockquote> <p>The <a href=\"http://video.cnbc.com/gallery/?video=3000595630\">full video is here.</a></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58aef582e4b08ddc9a5e2e34\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-02-23T14:48:24.650Z\">2.48pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Wall Street opens higher</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>It\u2019s become a daily event, but US markets have opened at new peaks once more.</p> <p>A rally in oil prices and continuing hopes of a increased spending and cuts in taxes from the Trump administration are keeping investors in an optimistic mood.</p> <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average has climbed 49 points to 20,824 while the S&amp;P 500 opened up 0.2% and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.04%.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-02-23T14:48:45.594Z\">at 2.48pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-58aef272e4b08ddc9a5e2e26\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-02-23T14:42:20.743Z\">2.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Growth in emerging markets and a reasonable performance from developed countries will see the global economy expand this year, according to<a href=\"https://www.moodys.com/research/Moodys-Global-economy-to-maintain-momentum-but-shifting-US-policies--PR_362449\"> a report from Moody\u2019s.</a> </p> <p>The agency says the outlook could however be affected by US policy shifts under the new administration, notably on trade and immigration.</p> <p>Overall Moody\u2019s says the average rate of growth in G20 countries is expected to rise from 2.6% in 2016 to 3% this year and in 2018.

      "bodyText": "The boss of PSA Group said the French carmaker\u2019s proposed purchase of General Motors\u2019 lossmaking European business could bring \u201cspeedy\u201d savings, prompting fresh fears over job cuts at Vauxhall in the UK \u2013 just hours after speaking to Theresa May. Carlos Tavares, the chief executive of PSA, which owns Peugeot, Citro\u00ebn and DS, said on Thursday morning that adding GM\u2019s German Opel and British Vauxhall brands would attract new customers and generate substantial cost savings. An outline agreement is expected to be announced as soon as next week, before the Geneva motor show starts on 6 March. May had stressed the British government\u2019s commitment to the UK car industry in a telephone conversation with the PSA executive on Wednesday evening. Tavares said he wanted to create a new \u201cEuropean car champion\u201d and pledged to work with national governments and unions worried about job losses. He is due to meet with the UK business secretary, Greg Clark, and Len McCluskey, the general secretary of Unite, Britain\u2019s biggest union, in London on Friday. However, Tavares also hinted that if the deal goes ahead he would carry out a major restructuring. At PSA, which came close to bankruptcy in 2014 but was saved by a state-backed bailout and Chinese investment, he has overseen a cost-cutting plan that involved a pay freeze, a factory closure and thousands of job cuts. Tavares told analysts and reporters: \u201cThis company needs help. What we see today with the situation of Opel ... has a lot of similarities with what we were facing four years ago.\u201d Cost savings would be achieved through measures including using the same chassis across different brands, he said. \u201cWhen you look at the product plan you see that you can in a quite speedy way implement quite significant synergies.\u201d Opel last reported a profit in 1999. Tavares said he would keep it as an independent division, as PSA hopes to benefit from the \u201chalo effect\u201d of German marques. \u201cNot only can we bring a solution and help Opel turn itself around, but we want to keep this company German.\u201d He said he plans a global push for Opel cars, which are not sold outside western Europe at present. \u201cThere is significant complementarity in terms of customer consideration between the German Opel brand and our three French brands ... In some markets in the world we have customers who, despite all the progress that we\u2019ve made, will not consider a French brand.\u201d A spokesman for the prime minister, commenting on May\u2019s conversation with Tavares, said: \u201cThe prime minister and Mr Tavares discussed the importance the UK attaches to Vauxhall\u2019s plants at Ellesmere Port and Luton and their shared desire to protect and promote the jobs it supports and what Mr Tavares referred to as the \u2018iconic\u2019 Vauxhall brand within the wider group. \u201cThe prime minister reiterated the government\u2019s commitment through our modern industrial strategy to creating and supporting the right conditions for the UK automotive industry to go from strength to strength, now and into the future. A particular shared goal was strengthening the UK\u2019s automotive supply chain.\u201d McCluskey criticised May for not meeting Tavares, \u201cas this would have been the opportunity for her to state that she will give UK plants the same, if not more, backing for the UK plants as the German and French leaders have given their workforces\u201d. PSA announced on Thursday it would resume dividend payments for the first time since 2011, after annual profits nearly doubled to \u20ac1.7bn from \u20ac899m in 2015, helped by cost cuts. Revenues were down 1.2%. The chief financial officer, Jean-Baptiste de Chatillon, said PSA took a \u201cbig hit\u201d on currency volatility, especially in Britain after the Brexit vote sent the pound plunging against the euro. The economy ministers of Germany and France were expected to discuss the deal at a meeting in Paris on Thursday. With France and Germany going to the polls in May and September respectively, jobs are a particularly sensitive issue. Opel has about 35,600 employees in Europe, including more than 18,250 in Germany. PSA would become Europe\u2019s second-biggest carmaker behind Volkswagen, with annual sales of 5m cars. Tavares said: \u201cWe believe there is an opportunity to create a European car champion, resulting from the combination of a French company and German company and without forgetting our UK friends.\u201d He said PSA would respect existing labour agreements but did not rule out job cuts. Tavares has spoken with the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and met with Opel employee representatives since the takeover discussions were announced last week. \u201cThe best way ... is to have unions and governments on your side,\u201d he said. In the UK, the job guarantees mean the production of the current Vauxhall Astra at Ellesmere Port and the Vivaro van in Luton should be guaranteed until 2020, but the company would then decide where to produce the next generation vehicles. Vauxhall\u2019s Ellesmere Port and Luton plants, headquarters and warehouse employ about 4,600 people, with a further 20,000 working in the carmaker\u2019s showrooms; a further 18,000 supply chain jobs depend on the carmaker. Vauxhall accounts for 14% of the UK car market. McCluskey said: \u201cA very concerning picture is emerging here ... Vauxhall workers and their union, Unite, have yet to be advised of General Motors\u2019 plans, but I say again to both auto makers and the UK government we will not accept any threats to UK plants and jobs. \u201cI will be reinforcing this when I meet with Carlos Tavares, the Peugeot head, this Friday. I will be saying again to him that GM has a unique place in the UK\u2019s marketplace, and that the company\u2019s share of that market has never been higher, so do not mistreat loyal UK workers and customers.\u201d",

Tavares has spoken with the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and met with Opel employee representatives since the takeover discussions were announced last week. \u201cThe best way ... is to have unions and governments on your side,\u201d he said.</p> <p>In the UK, the job guarantees mean the production of the current <a href=\"http://www.autoexpress.co.uk/vauxhall/astra\">Vauxhall Astra</a> at Ellesmere Port and the <a href=\"http://www.autoexpress.co.uk/vauxhall/vivaro\">Vivaro</a> van in Luton should be guaranteed until 2020, but the company would then decide where to produce the next generation vehicles. </p> <p>Vauxhall\u2019s Ellesmere Port and Luton plants, headquarters and warehouse employ about 4,600 people, with a further 20,000 working in the carmaker\u2019s showrooms; a further 18,000 supply chain jobs depend on the carmaker. Vauxhall accounts for 14% of the UK car market.</p> <p>McCluskey said: \u201cA very concerning picture is emerging here ... Vauxhall workers and their union, Unite, have yet to be advised of General Motors\u2019 plans, but I say again to both auto makers and the UK government we will not accept any threats to UK plants and jobs. </p> <p>\u201cI will be reinforcing this when I meet with Carlos Tavares, the Peugeot head, this Friday. I will be saying again to him that GM has a unique place in the UK\u2019s marketplace, and that the company\u2019s share of that market has never been higher, so do not mistreat loyal UK workers and customers.\u201d</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Germany overtook the UK as the fastest growing among the G7 states during 2016. Europe\u2019s largest economy expanded at the fastest rate in five years, showing growth of 1.9% last year. The expansion pushed Britain into second place among the G7 industrialised nations, after the Office for National Statistics revised down annual UK growth to 1.8%, from an initial estimate of 2%. In the final quarter of 2016 Germany\u2019s economy grew by 0.4%, improving on 0.1% growth in the third quarter. It was fuelled by domestic demand as government and consumer spending rose. Germany proved the International Monetary Fund wrong, after the Washington-based fund predicted the UK would outpace its G7 peers. Alan Clarke, economist at Scotiabank, said the economies of both countries had turned out a decent performance last year, and pointed out that UK growth of 0.7% had outpaced Germany in the fourth quarter. He said: \u201cUK economic growth in 2016 was fractionally below that of Germany \u2013 no longer the fastest growing in the G7. In the big scheme of things 0.1 percentage points between friends isn\u2019t something that anyone is going to notice. And if anyone wanted to pick a fight, you are only as good as your last game and the UK scored 0.7% growth in the fourth quarter. Both economies are doing pretty well and survey indicators for [each] suggest more good news early 2017.\u201d Germany\u2019s statistics office, Destatis, described the country\u2019s economy as \u201csolid and steady\u201d. The figures suggested German consumers had so far shrugged off the uncertainty created by Britain\u2019s decision to leave the European union. In the final quarter, government spending in Germany rose 0.8%, and household spending increased by 0.3%. Trade was a drag on GDP however, as the 3.1% growth in imports outpaced exports growth of 1.8%. Economists said growth in 2017 was likely to be slower than the 1.9% achieved in 2016. The German government is forecasting growth of 1.4% this year. Jennifer McKeown, chief European economist at Capital Economics, said: \u201cGerman GDP was growing at a healthy pace at the end of last year, driven mainly by consumer spending. While business surveys suggest that growth will accelerate further in the near term, March\u2019s dip in consumer confidence may be an early sign of a slowdown in spending to come. In all, the German economy remains in good health. But we doubt that it will go from strength to strength.\u201d A strong economic backdrop has helped Germany post a record budget surplus of \u20ac23.7bn in 2017, fuelled by higher tax revenues, rising employment and low debt costs. It was the highest budget surplus since reunification in 1990 and the third successive year the government has had a budget surplus. Olga Tschekassin, an economist at Barclays, said government and state spending would continue to be the main drivers of growth in the coming quarters. \u201cHowever, external factors such as Brexit and US trade policy, and a series of upcoming elections in the euro area, will likely increase uncertainty and could harm investment.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The boss of British Gas\u2019s parent company has defended the worst-value energy deals that two-thirds of households are on, saying they are not the \u201cevil empire\u201d. Iain Conn, Centrica\u2019s chief executive, claimed such standard variable tariffs, which are around \u00a3200 more expensive than the cheapest fixed-price deals, are good value, customers found them attractive and chose to be on them. However, ministers are concerned that too many people are paying over the odds on the tariffs. \u201cStandard tariffs are not necessarily the evil empire and they are actually offering decent energy value,\u201d Conn said. British Gas has frozen its standard variable tariff, which costs an average of \u00a31,044 per year, until August despite three of the other big six energy suppliers hiking prices. Conn\u2019s comments come as Centrica posted an operating profit for 2016 of \u00a31.5bn, up 4% on 2015, despite British Gas losing 400,000 customers in the first half of the year. The results were largely seen as positive by analysts but prompted consumer groups to accuse Centrica of making big profits while consumer bills remained high. Citizens Advice called for an extension of a recent price cap by the regulator Ofgem for 4m households on prepayment meters. But Conn suggested the government will soon rule out any such price cap on standard tariffs. \u201cThe government aren\u2019t sure they need to intervene,\u201d he said, referring to a white paper due to be published in April. He said the market was working and questioned the wisdom of a price cap, arguing it would simply shift blame from energy suppliers to ministers. \u201cIf you are going to start fixing prices, when are you going to stop? Then it becomes not our problem \u2013 if people want to complain about energy prices they\u2019ll have to blame the government.\u201d On Thursday, Co-operative Energy announced its second price rise this winter, with electricity and gas prices to increase 5% from April for nearly 100,000 customers on its standard tariff. Centrica suggested some of the newer players among the 40-plus suppliers in the market were running at a loss on their cheaper deals. \u201cSome of them appear to be offering energy at a loss to them, and I\u2019m not sure how sustainable that is,\u201d Conn said. He also welcomed a new review by Ofgem on whether to introduce stricter financial health checks and rules before new energy suppliers could get a licence. \u201cI think they\u2019re starting to realise it isn\u2019t just about setting up in a garage with a website and a couple of people on the phone. The risk that one manages in supplying energy is tangible and if large companies go bust, everyone loses.\u201d Centrica\u2019s adjusted operating profit of \u00a31.5bn, achieved partly through cutting costs, was slightly above expectations. But the \u00a3553m of operating profit brought in by British Gas was down 11% on the year before. Analysts said they were surprised by the company\u2019s decision to keep its dividend to shareholders flat this year, which Centrica said was due to to it prioritising paying down debt and an increase in pension costs after interest rates fell last year. Energy comparison sites branded British Gas\u2019s 3% decline in customers an \u201cexodus\u201d and said people on the company\u2019s standard tariff could save \u00a3210 a year. \u201cUntil British Gas can offer really cheap tariffs they will continue to lose hundreds of thousands of customers a year,\u201d said Mark Todd, co-founder of energyhelpline.",

      "bodyText": "Barclays tripled its profits last year but is still facing hefty fines and penalties and has cut its payout to shareholders. The bank\u2019s chairman, John McFarlane, said that despite the rise in profits from \u00a31.1bn to \u00a33.2bn \u2013 fuelled by a fall in provisions for legal matters from \u00a34.3bn to \u00a31.3bn \u2013 it still faced further fines and would also have to manage the fallout from Brexit. The bank is paying out \u00a3500m to investors from the 3p a share dividend \u2013 as flagged last year. However, it is still handing \u00a31.5bn to staff in bonuses. A total of 364 Barclays staff were paid more than \u00a31m last year, including 11 who received more than \u00a35m. The bank, which has been scrambling to repair its reputation since the 2012 Libor rate-fixing scandal, is fighting the US Department of Justice over a decade-old mortgage bond misselling scandal. It is also awaiting the outcome of an investigation by the UK\u2019s Serious Fraud Office into the way it raised funds during the height of the banking crisis. It has ongoing Libor investigations by the SFO and authorities in Italy. McFarlane said: \u201cA number of potentially material legacy conduct matters need to be resolved at acceptable cost.\u201d He also cited the need to \u201cmitigate the risk of the UK\u2019s exit from the EU\u201d and complete the sale of the bank\u2019s African\u2019s business as among the matters hanging over the bank. Barclays\u2019 shares initially rose by 3% but later reversed these gains to fall 3% to 227p. In 2015, when the shares were changing hands at 260p, McFarlane promised to double the share price in three years. A year ago, McFarlane had complained about the fines and taxes imposed on the bank as it cut dividends in half to pay for a scaling-back in Africa to focus on the UK and US under its new chief executive, Jes Staley. Staley, who joined Barclays 13 months ago, said he wanted to reach a deal with the Department of Justice over the residential mortgage bond securities misselling scandal on the same terms as those reached by US banks. European bank bosses believe they have been more harshly treated than their US counterparts. The annual report showed that Staley, an American recruited in 2015, received \u00a34.2m in 2016, his first full year in charge. The Robin Hood Tax Campaign, which campaigns for a tax on banks to tackle poverty and climate change, said: \u201cBarclays boasts of trebling profits and making hundreds of their employees millionaires but nothing has improved for most ordinary people since the banking crash. The harsh reality for millions is the daily struggle to make ends meet.\u201d Changes are also being proposed to the way Staley and the finance director, Tushar Morzaria, are paid. They will no longer receive a \u201csalary\u201d but instead receive \u201cfixed pay\u201d, which incorporates their salary and the role-based allowances that were introduced by major banks following the EU pay restrictions that capped bonuses. Barclays intends to give Staley \u00a32.3m of fixed pay for the next three years, half in shares and half in cash. His current pay arrangement involves a \u00a31.2m salary and \u00a31.15m in share-based fixed pay allowances. Morzaria is to get \u00a31.6m in fixed pay, compared with a \u00a3800,000 salary and \u00a3750,000 in role-based allowances.",

      "bodyText": "Andy Street quit as the boss of John Lewis last year to try to become the mayor of the West Midlands. If elected in May, he plans to turn back to his former employer in an attempt to revolutionise public services. Street is looking to bring the company\u2019s employee-owned partnership model into vital local services such as transport, social care and skills training, handing workers a stake in their performance. The Conservative mayoral candidate said he could spin off existing services into new mutually owned operations, provide funding for these and social enterprises to compete for contracts, and allow existing mutuals, enterprises and charities to take on public work. Mutuals are fully or majority owned by members, while social enterprises work to support communities or the environment. \u201cThe simple point about John Lewis is that it\u2019s been successful partly because of its model, which is all about owners [the employees] giving that extra commitment and therefore a better service experience,\u201d said Street. \u201cSo then you say, \u2018OK, where else is labour-intensive and this differential effort could make an impact?\u2019 What we want to look at is the opportunity for mutuals in the public sector here. My own view is that as councils come under more cost pressure, we will need to look at more alternative models.\u201d Street, who is the bookies\u2019 favourite to become mayor, said adult skills training, transport and mental health were specific services under his remit that could be overhauled. He added that other parts of the public sector could also benefit from the mutual model. \u201cIt is not a far cry from this sort of sharing economy to think that you could set up a mutual ownership within public transport operators,\u201d he said. \u201cSo that is something we would like to explore, possibly park-and-rides being done on a mutual basis.\u201d Having a stake in the performance of the West Midlands is a core part of Street\u2019s campaign. He has also proposed that 50% of his pay should be performance-related. His ideas appear to be going down well with voters in the region, which covers Birmingham, Coventry, Wolverhampton as well as the surrounding towns and countryside. Bookmakers have Street, who grew up in Birmingham, as favourite to become mayor ahead of Labour rival, Sion Simon, an MEP. The 53-year-old said there were three forces supporting his campaign in an area traditionally dominated by Labour. \u201cThe first is that there has been a national shift \u2013 and every local election always reflects national elections to some extent - particularly in an area that voted heavily for Brexit,\u201d he said. \u201cI like the way Theresa May is delivering Brexit \u2013 I think it is definitely finding favour. \u201cThen I think there are two local things going on. I think people are really getting the fact that this is electing one person to do one specific job. This is not a party political popularity role. So the feedback I am getting is that my background of being a businessperson who has delivered something, as opposed to a career politician, is finding favour at the moment. \u201cThe third thing is that our campaign is genuinely going down well. We are putting together a positive campaign full of ideas, and I think our opponent\u2019s [Labour\u2019s] campaign is not going down as well.\u201d Street said he had taken inspiration from other mayors who have a background in business \u2013 particularly the radical Liberal Joseph Chamberlain in Birmingham in the late 19th century \u2013 although he was keen to distance himself from another business figure who had recently moved into politics. \u201cOne or two people say to me, \u2018Are you the Trump of the West Midlands?\u2019 The Labour party are the establishment here. The majority of MPs, the majority of councils, they have run them for years and years and years. We are the challenger, we are the insurgent. It\u2019s a good place to be. I think that will help up us,\u201d he said. \u201cIs there some similarity to Trump there? Of course there is. But are my policies, values, and approach anywhere similar to Trump? No way. We have spent a lot of time talking about inclusiveness, his whole campaign was about divisiveness.\u201d Street added that he had also learned from others mayors who represented their city rather than their party - particularly Ken Livingstone and Boris Johnson in London. One of the reasons Street said he was confident about winning the election was because lifelong Labour voters had told him they would vote for him. Despite this confidence, there is still a risk that he loses, having left one of the top jobs in British business \u2013 and an annual pay package of about \u00a31m \u2013 for nothing. Street said his parents, who still live in the house where he grew up, were both mystified by his decision and at the same time full of admiration. He started thinking about leaving John Lewis after he saw other people linked with the West Midlands mayoralty. \u201cI looked at it and thought, \u2018That\u2019s my job, I can\u2019t have that,\u2019\u201d he said. After Theresa May became prime minister last summer, she pledged to give Street her full support if he stood for mayor, which was the encouragement he needed to make a final decision. \u201cThere is absolutely no plan B. You might think that is ridiculous, but it is utterly true. I have thrown everything into this. I have walked out of my job, everything that goes with it. I have just said I am going to concentrate 100% on this, give it my best shot, and that\u2019s it. \u201cOn paper this is a Labour area, but I did know this \u2013 I couldn\u2019t live with myself if it didn\u2019t give it a damn good try.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The mobile operator O2 has struck a deal thought to be worth about \u00a3125m to keep the naming rights to the London venue the O2 until at least 2027. The 10-year deal, announced the day after the venue played host to the 2017 Brit awards, means the Telefonica-owned mobile operator\u2019s relationship with what was once the ill-fated Millennium Dome will stretch to at least 20 years. Under the agreement with Anschutz Entertainment Group (AEG) \u2013 the US company that purchased the site five years after it was shut after the millennium celebrations \u2013 O2 is thought to be paying between \u00a310m and \u00a315m a year in a wide-ranging partnership deal. A key component of the deal is a doubling of the number of priority tickets that will be made available to O2 customers, giving them access to tickets to events 48 hours before they go on sale to the public. The number of tickets to be made available each year has not been disclosed. \u201cOur loyalty programme is about unforgettable live experiences and memories,\u201d said Nina Bibby, chief marketing officer at O2 UK. \u201cAt the heart of that is our sponsorship assets and the O2.\u201d Since reopening in 2007 the O2 has hosted acts and events including Prince, One Direction, Iron Maiden, Beyonc\u00e9, the annual ATP World Tour tennis finals as well as NBA basketball matches and the Ultimate Fighting Championship.
