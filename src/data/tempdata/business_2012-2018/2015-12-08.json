      "bodyText": "\u201cWe create value that lasts,\u201d proclaims Anglo American\u2019s website. Try telling that to the shareholders. The shares, down 12% on Tuesday, have fallen 90% since high points in 2008 and 2011 and are now cheaper than when the 98-year-old mining company arrived on the London stock market in 1999. By market capitalisation, Anglo \u2013 extraordinarily \u2013 has drifted to the bottom end of the FTSE 100 index. The equity is worth just \u00a34.6bn. Even Mondi, the obscure packaging and paper outfit that Anglo demerged in 2007, is more valuable these days. If the share price is a shadow of its former self, that is also the chief executive Mark Cutifani\u2019s plan for Anglo\u2019s operations. The strategy is to sell or close 60% of the assets and reduce the number of employees from 135,000 to fewer than 50,000. The plush London head office in St James\u2019s will be abandoned, as will dividends for at least 18 months. The claim of \u201cradical\u201d restructuring is justified. On paper, cutting costs and capital expenditure, while selling mines that can\u2019t prove their worth, sounds reasonable. As always happens in commodity markets, abundant demand has been followed by over-abundant supply. Prices of almost everything are crashing. So it is fair to conclude Anglo\u2019s long-term health depends on slimming down to the best assets in a broad and ragged portfolio. In practice, that means diamonds, where the De Beers unit has about a third of the world market; copper, where Anglo has some high-class mines in Chile; and platinum, where the market share is about 35%. If Anglo was starting from scratch, that collection would provide a solid core. The trouble is, Anglo is not starting afresh. Cutifani, as he unveiled his vision of a smaller but more \u201cresilient\u201d company, left some huge questions unanswered. What happens to the nickel, coal and iron ore assets, none of which are trivial in the context of Anglo? They need to show they can drive down costs and produce cash consistently, argued Cutifani. \u201cIf not, they won\u2019t be in the portfolio, it\u2019s as simple as that,\u201d he said. Is it that simple, though? For a company such as Anglo American \u2013 tangled in South African politics and history for almost a century \u2013 selling, closing or restructuring local mines is never straightforward. The government, in effect, has the final say. After long and awkward negotiations, Anglo earlier this year secured a disposal of its labour-intensive, non-mechanised platinum interests in Rustenburg. But those talks might look a tea party if Anglo produces similar plans for its coal and iron ore mines in South Africa. Whatever happens, the company will not shed its heritage quickly. Does it have the luxury of time? The finance director gave a decent account of how borrowings, forecast to be $13bn to $13.5bn at year-end, are manageable. Even if the debt is downgraded to junk status, the interest rate will not increase; and the facilities are in place to 2020. Those features are clearly helpful but borrowings are still twice as large as the current value of the equity. Would-be buyers of assets will smell desperation. Nor can Anglo be confident that commodity prices will not fall further. Cutifani, in declining to raise fresh capital via a rights issue while he has the chance, is taking a big gamble. Tesco\u2019s portfolio is withering Dave Lewis is not having much luck at Tesco. The garden centre chain Dobbies, one of those businesses the chief executive\u2019s predecessors acquired during Tesco\u2019s imperialist era, has just reported a \u00a348m loss in accounts filed at Companies House. The performance was not quite as discouraging as it sounds because a \u00a354.4m property write-down was largely responsible. On the other hand, little in Tesco\u2019s UK periphery is currently providing relief. Giraffe restaurants and Harris + Hoole coffee shops served losses; profits at the One Stop convenience chain halved; even the supposed jewel, the data firm Dunhumby, was down 9%. None of those results would matter terribly if shareholders could be confident that Tesco\u2019s supermarkets, where Lewis has understandably concentrated his efforts during 15 months at the helm, were set for a bumper Christmas. Last year\u2019s seasonal performance was vaguely encouraging as Lewis, with little time to engineer a major overhaul, caught shoppers\u2019 eyes with cheap vegetables and arrested the steep decline in sales. Expectations will be higher this year \u2013 or, rather, they were. In fact, optimism has evaporated from the share price, which rallied from 160p to 240p in the afterglow of last Christmas but has now descended to a 15-year low of 156.5p. Life is tough for middle-market grocers, as nobody needs reminding, but the share price points to the fear that Tesco has spent a year going sideways. It will not feel that way internally, and maybe Lewis will be able to produce a surprise in the New Year update. But the pre-Christmas ad campaign feels almost invisible.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The world\u2019s leading oil producers are preparing for the possibility of oil prices halving to $20 a barrel after a second day of financial market turmoil saw a fresh slide in crude, the lowest iron ore prices in a decade, and losses on global stock markets. Benchmark Brent crude briefly dipped below $40 a barrel for the first time since February 2009 before speculators took profits on the 8% drop in the cost of crude since last week\u2019s abortive attempt by the oil cartel Opec to steady the market. But warnings by commodity analysts that the respite could be shortlived were underlined when Russia said it would need to make additional budget cuts if the oil price halved over the coming months. Alexei Moiseev, Russia\u2019s deputy finance minister, told Reuters: \u201cIf oil goes to $20, we will need to do additional [spending] cuts. Clearly we have shown that we are very willing to cut fiscal spending in line with an oil price at $60, for example. In order for us to be long-term sustainable [with the] oil price at $40, we need to do additional cuts, but if the oil price goes to $20 we need to do even more cuts.\u201d Russia and Saudi Arabia \u2013 the world\u2019s two biggest oil producers \u2013 both increased spending when oil prices rose to well above $100 a barrel. The fall from a recent peak of $115 a barrel in August 2014 has left all Opec members in financial difficulty, but Saudi Arabia has refused to relent on a strategy of using a low crude price to knock out US shale producers. Hopes that Opec would announce production curbs to push prices up were dashed when the cartel met in Vienna last Friday, triggering the latest downward lurch in the cost of oil. Lord Browne, the former chief executive of BP, refused to rule out the possibility that oil could halve again in price when he was interviewed by Bloomberg TV. Asked if oil could hit $20 a barrel, Browne \u2013 who ran BP from 1995 to 2007 during a period when the cost of crude rose from $10 to $100 a barrel, said in the short term nothing was impossible. He added: \u201cIn the long run, $20 is probably wrong, but that\u2019s as far as I\u2019d go.\u201d Weak export figures from China triggered the early fall in the price of oil and industrial metals on Tuesday. Iron ore\u2019s 10-year low was accompanied by declines in zinc, lead and nickel, leaving mining companies to bear the brunt of a renewed sell-off in equity markets. In London, the FTSE 100 dropped 1.42% to close 88.3 points lower at 6135.22. Germany\u2019s Dax lost almost 2% to end the day 212 points down at 10673.6, while in early trading in New York, the Dow Jones industrial average was down just over 150 points. Connor Campbell at Spreadex said: \u201cThere is little on the horizon that looks like it can provide a salve for today\u2019s commodity burns; if anything, with a Chinese inflation figure released in the early hours of Wednesday morning, a figure that could easily underperform expectations if today\u2019s trade balance data is anything to go by, tomorrow may be even worse.\u201d Samuel Tombs, UK economist at Pantheon, said another downward lurch in oil prices could delay an interest rate increase from the Bank of England. \u201cProvided oil prices don\u2019t continue to slide, then inflation looks on track to pick up from -0.1% in October to about 1% in March, the latest number the [Bank of England\u2019s] monetary policy committee will have before its May inflation report.\u201d He said: \u201cIt\u2019s a close call, but that rate probably will be strong enough to convince a majority of MPC members that an interest rate rise is warranted. A further plunge in oil prices to below $30 probably would keep CPI inflation below 1% and likely would persuade the committee to stand pat for a few more months.\u201d The consultancy Capital Economics said: \u201cBrent\u2019s [short-lived] dip today below $40 per barrel is a further damning verdict on Opec\u2019s bungled communications after its meeting last Friday. However, it was never likely that the group would agree to cut output to boost prices. Instead, any recovery next year will depend on reductions in non-Opec supply and on stronger demand. On this basis, while we are lowering our end-2016 forecast for Brent from $60 to $55, we continue to expect oil prices to stage a partial recovery next year.\u201d",

When Wall Street opens at lunchtime, every single company on the Dow Jones slumps. Copper, that leading indicator of the state of the world economy, continues to drift lower and lower. And the cost of a barrel of Brent Crude oil has dropped so low that you can buy one, should you wish, for about the same amount as a pair of kids\u2019 roller skates. Businesses are beginning to pull in their horns too. Rio Tinto announced today that it was cutting back on its investment plans \u2013 not so surprising since it\u2019s fundamentally a mining company struggling with falling prices for the stuff it digs up. But high-street anchor Marks &amp; Spencer also announced a drop in its capital spending. And the week began with a survey of Britain\u2019s manufacturers showing they expect both output and employment to stagnate. So much for the latest headlines: let\u2019s put this in some context. China, one of the most important motors of the world economy since the crash, is beginning to sputter. Christine Lagarde, the boss of the IMF, has warned again and again that the world is heading into a \u201cnew mediocre\u201d, while the Bank of England\u2019s chief economist, Andy Haldane, talks of \u201cthe emerging markets crisis of 2015\u201d. Let us not take these predictions as bound to come true. Ask instead a more uncomfortable question: if the world economy is heading into icy headwinds, how well insulated is Britain? The answer is: not enough. David Cameron came into office talking about how he was going to \u201crebalance\u201d the economy away from London and the south-east, while George Osborne promised a historic boom in business investment and an export renaissance. The chancellor then foresaw a \u201cmarch of the makers\u201d. These were all good things to wish for, but none of them have been delivered. Infrastructure spending has poured into the same old corner of Britain, whether it be for the London Olympics, the new Crossrail, the Thames Tideway or the Channel Tunnel Rail Link. Business investment has picked up a little very recently \u2013 but has fallen far short of the 2010 optimism. And the main thing driving growth in the British economy is not manufacturing and certainly not exports but consumer spending. What\u2019s more, the Office for Budget Responsibility\u2019s forecasts \u2013 issued last month \u2013 for continued steady growth for the rest of this decade rely on British households carrying on splurging. As the OBR itself points out: \u201cAvailable historical data suggest that this persistent and relatively large household deficit would be unprecedented.\u201d Two things can be said about this. Either the UK economy is going to keep growing even as the Bank of England starts to raise interest rates and the rest of the world slows down \u2013 on the back of household spending. Or households aren\u2019t going to be spending anywhere as much as the OBR assumes \u2013 with the result that the UK economy doesn\u2019t grow that much at all. Neither outcome would give Mr Osborne much to boast about. The chancellor can argue that he has improved financial regulation from the failed light-touch regime of New Labour. True enough, but he has not split up too-big-to-fail banks, and he and his regulators have been weak on banking competition. As last week\u2019s stress tests show, the Bank of England has been far too understanding of the City\u2019s claims to be resilient. If this is what amounts to an insurance policy, let\u2019s pray we don\u2019t need to use it.",

Details of the exact tax rate, its application and the allocation of its proceeds still need to be thrashed out before a final deal is signed next summer. France, Spain and Belgium have already committed to earmark chunks of the tobin tax revenues for climate aid, a move which may help allay fears among some developing countries about the over-use of loans and private finance in a fund planned to raise $100bn a year by 2020. Pascal Canfin, the co-chair of France\u2019s presidential committee for innovative finance, said that the announcement would add to momentum for a climate deal in Paris. \u201cIt is obvious that this tax could be a tool to provide more finance to the countries in need but it depends on the willingness of the participating countries to allocate the money for climate objectives,\u201d he said. \u201cThe key issue now is for Germany to step over the line and for this decision to be translated into the paris talks in the coming hours,\u201d he added. Belgium and Italy could could also make similar pledges soon, he said. But the Robin Hood-style commitment to taxing all intra-day shares and derivatives trades provoked the Estonian finance minister to walk out of the Brussels meeting, and the British chancellor George Osborne to warn of the effect it could have on pensioners savings. \u201cWe can challenge this financial tax in the European court if this implicates other states including the United Kingdom,\u201d warned Osborne. As well as raising climate funds, the financial transaction tax is intended to curb speculative trading, harmonise bank levies across the EU and recover some of the public funds used to support banks during the economic crisis. Talks about the issue have been ongoing since 2011. David Nussbaum, the CEO of WWF UK called on Osborne to reflect on the miniscule nature of the tax rates being considered \u2013 0.1% or 0.01% - and address its competition concerns by pushing for the charge to be applied globally. \u201cIf you look at the financial crisis, some of it was caused or exacerbated by high speed trading,\u201d he said. \u201cLord Adair Turner has talked about how quite a lot of activity in the financial services sector was socially useless and if there\u2019s socially useless activity going on, that seems a pretty good thing to tax.\u201d Canfin, a former French development minister said that the proposed fund would generate a minimum of \u20ac10bn to \u20ac15bn (\u00a37.2bn to \u00a310.8bn) a year.

Environmentalists argue that the figure also counts grants that only partly cover climate-related issues, and that most of the public finance comes from existing and often stagnant development aid budgets. The United Nations environment programme projects that climate adaptation costs alone will reach $250bn to $500bn a year by 2050. \u201cWe will need to find new sources of financial support for climate action and sustainable development,\u201d said Maeve McLynn, a spokeswoman for Climate Action Network Europe. \u201cBy postponing an agreement on the financial transaction tax until next summer, leaders are just kicking the can further down the road.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The slump in oil and iron ore has sent commodity companies, and by extension stock markets, sharply lower again. Even a revival in the oil price - Brent crude is currently down 0.9% at $40.34 a barrel after earlier falling as low as $39.81 - failed to make much impact. (Although it did help BP become, surprisingly, just one of two risers in the UK market, the other being a rather more defensive stock in the form of Sainsbury). Anglo American\u2019s decision to scrap its dividend sent its shares moire than 12% lower and, with weak Chinese trade data, helped push mining shares lower. Iron ore fell for the seventh day in a row, down another 1.2% to $38.9, the lowest level since the Steel Index began in 2008. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 fell 1.42% or 88.30 points to 6135.22 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 1.95% to 10,673.60 France\u2019s Cac closed 1.57% lower at 4681.86 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB lost 2.26% to 21,538.04 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 2.04% at 9837.1 In Greece, the Athens market finished 4.43% lower at 581.90 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is now down 169 points or 0.95%. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. The FTSE 100 in the UK - dominated by commodity companies - has ended down 1.42%, its lowest level since the 6118 it reached on 13 November. Here is the damage done by the mining sector: Russia will cut spending even further if the oil price continues to fall, according to deputy finance minister Alexei Moiseev. He told Reuters in London that the government would stick to tight fiscal policies as the economy contracted. He said: If oil goes to $20, we will need to do additional (spending) cuts. Clearly we have shown that we are very willing to cut fiscal spending in line with an oil price at $60, for example. In order for us to be long-term sustainable (with the) oil price at $40, we need to do additional cuts, but if the oil price goes to $20 we need to do even more cuts. Of course, one of the reasons for the hefty fall in Anglo American\u2019s share price - down nearly 11% at the moment - is that the mining company is dropping its payout to shareholders. There is also the worry that this sets a precedent for the rest of the sectors. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG said: Today\u2019s decision from Anglo American to scrap its dividend is likely to be the beginning of a worrying trend for the miners. The attractiveness of owning oil or mining shares has been questionable of late and with the prospect of dividends also being scrapped, the sector is fast running out of reasons to invest. The selloff seen across FTSE commodities stocks highlights the flock to dividend safety with Anglo American likely to be the first of many firms sacrificing its dividend. He also highlights the forthcoming Chinese inflation figures due overnight and points out that, in a return to the old bad news is good news mantra, a weak reading could be a benefit: The commodities sector will be back in focus tomorrow, following the release of Chinese CPI data. With China firmly at the forefront of traders\u2019 minds following the overnight trade data, many will be hoping for a weak CPI reading to advance the view that China will ease once more, spurring on greater domestic consumption and investment. Mining companies continue to be the day\u2019s big losers but oil shares have edged - very slightly - higher as the crude price came back from its worst levels. Anglo American is currently 11% down while Rio Tinto is off more than 7%. But BP is 1.2p ahead at 348.8p and Royal Dutch Shell A shares have added 2.5p to \u00a315.21. Brent crude is down 0.9% at $40.36 after falling as low as $39.81. But analyst Connor Campbell at Spreadex said: There is little on the horizon that looks like it can provide a salve for today\u2019s commodity burns; if anything, with a Chinese inflation figure released in the early hours of Wednesday morning, a figure that could easily underperform expectations if today\u2019s trade balance data is anything to go by, tomorrow may be even worse. In the UK, the Bank of England is on track to raise interest rates in February after the NIESR think tank said the country\u2019s economy grew at around 0.6% in the three months to November. This is down from the 0.5% figure for the three months to October. NIESR said: This implies a year-on-year growth rate of 2.2 per cent for the three months to November 2015, compared with 2.3 from the three months to October 2015... This rate of growth is consistent with the continued absorption of spare capacity in the UK economy and our own view that the Bank of England is most likely to begin to increase rates in February 2016,\u201d NIESR said. Still in the US and monthly job openings came in lower than expected at 5.38m in October compared to 5.53m last month and forecasts of 5.5m. This is a measure that the US Federal Reserve pays close attention to, but the slightly weaker figure is unlikely to dissuade the central bank from lifting interest rates next week. The quits rate - which reflects how confident people are that they will find a new job when they resign from their existing one - was steady at 1.9% (for the seventh consecutive month). Every share on the Dow Jones industrial average is in the red. Oil giant Exxon is leading the fallers, down 3.1%, followed by major rival Chevron which has lost 2.9%. Caterpillar is next, down 2.5%. It makes mining and construction machinery and vehicles, meaning it is very exposed to the ups and downs of the global economy. US oil companies are dropping sharply in early trading, dragging Wall Street down. Investors are reacting to the slump in the oil price, the iron ore rout, and weak Chinese trade data overnight (exports shrank by 6.8% year-on-year in November, while imports fell by 8.7%) The opening bell is ringing on the New York stock market, and trading is underway..... ...and shares are falling, fast, as investors respond to the latest twists in the commodity market. The Dow Jones industrial average has swiftly shed 201 points to 17530 points. That\u2019s a drop of 1.1%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq index lost 0.99%. And the broader S&amp;P 500 is also down 1%, putting it in the red for 2015. This matching the losses in Asia and Europe already today (see earlier post for full details). At the risk of drifting into domestic politics, the oil price rout would be posing serious questions for an independent Scotland. Over in the City, the FTSE 100 index has shed 88 points or 1.4% as shares are buffered by the commodity crunch. Anglo American is ploughing new lows, down 11.4% as investors reacts to its plan to cut thousands of jobs and suspend its dividend (covered earlier in the blog) Glencore, the mining and commodity giant, has tumbled by 10%. And Antofagasta, the copper producer, is down almost 7%. Conner Campbell of SpreadEx sums it up: Both oil and mining sectors are in dire straits at the moment. There are now only three risers on the FTSE 100 -- the other 97 blue-chip companies are in the red. They include EasyJet and IAG (British Airway\u2019s parent company) are bucking the trend, both up around 0.5%. They should benefit from cheaper oil prices. Here\u2019s confirmation that Brent crude has slumped into the $39/barrel region for the first time since the global downturn in 2009, via Bloomberg: Brent crude has crashed through the $40 per barrel mark for the first time since February 2009. A barrel of Brent crude, sourced from fields in the North Sea, for delivery in January is changing hands for just $39.95 today. That\u2019s a fall of over 1.5%, or 78 cents, adding to yesterday\u2019s 5% tumble. Brent crude has now lost almost 8% since last week\u2019s OPEC meeting, where cartel members were unable to agree production quotas. It\u2019s a roller coaster ride, as this oil chart deftly shows: Hold on tight, Calvin! The Canadian dollar is a casualty of today\u2019s swings. The \u2018Loonie\u2019 has fallen to a new 11-year low against the US dollar, dropping below 74 cents for the first time in 11 years. Canada is the sixth-largest oil producer in the world, so will suffer from the slump in crude prices. Ipek Ozkardeskaya of London Capital Group says: \u201cThe prospects of cheaper oil should keep the pressure on the downside despite the deepening oversold conditions in the loonie.\u201d Why is oil falling again? Analysts says the oil price is still suffering from Opec\u2019s failure to agree production cuts, which means its members are free to pump merrily away. As Amrita Sen, chief oil analyst at consultants Energy Aspects Ltd, puts it: \u201cOPEC countries will continue to pump as much as possible for now....\u201cSo the crude market remains oversupplied.\u201d Oil is also susceptible to \u201cflash crashes\u201d, in which the price can suddenly plummet when high-speed computer trading software kicks in. Back in October, regulators said there had been 35 oil flash crashes this year alone. The FT explained at the time that: Such so-called \u201cflash events\u201d have become linked with the growing popularity of high-speed, computerised trading, which has been criticised by institutional investors for fuelling volatility. Where US oil leads, Brent crude may follow.... Oil has suddenly dropped almost 2% to fresh six-year lows, surprising and alarming analysts: The selloff in the oil price is accelerating, sending crude down to fresh lows. US crude just crumbled through the $37/barrel mark, for the first time since early 2009. And Brent crude, sourced from the North Sea, is on the brink of dropping through $40/barrel, having hit new near-seven year lows yesterday. Global stock markets are all falling today, as a sea of red electronic ink sweeps across the City and beyond. Europe\u2019s major equities indices are all down, following losses overnight in Asia. And Middle East markets are also weaker. with Egypt\u2019s EGX 30 losing almost 2.4% Energy and mining companies are, predictably leading the selloff. Here\u2019s the damage: The Saudi stock market (not pictured above) has also been hit: And Wall Street is expected to follow, when trading begins in under two hours time. After a calm start, the oil price is dipping as US traders reach their desks. US crude has dipped into the red, touching new near-seven year lows. Anglo American is planning to lose around 85,000 workers, under the restructuring plan announced by the troubled miner today. That\u2019s on top of the dividend freeze that will last 18 months. My colleague Sean Farrell explains: In a presentation to investors, Anglo American said it would reduce its number of mines from 55 to about 20 and cut employee numbers from 135,000 to less than 50,000 after 2017. It will halve the number of business units from six to three: the De Beers diamond operation, industrial metals and bulk commodities. The company, which mines iron ore, manganese, coal, copper and nickel, said it would cut capital spending by a further $1bn (\u00a3670m) to the end of 2016, taking the reduction in capital spending to $2.9bn by the end of 2017. It increased the amount it plans to raise from asset sales to $4bn from $3bn.... Iron ore is slipping further below $40/tonne to new 10-year lows.... Britain\u2019s factories could face a tough winter, as the challenging global economy hits demand for exports. New data shows that UK manufacturing output shrank by 0.4% in October, meaning the sector is still below its peak in 2008. My colleague Heather Stewart explains: Official figures showed that while George Osborne has pledged to unleash a \u201cmarch of the makers\u201d, manufacturing output in October stood 0.1% lower than the same month in 2014 \u2014 and remains 6.1% below its pre-recession peak. Overall industrial production, which includes mining and utilities, as well as manufacturing, increased just 0.1% in October on the previous month, and 1.7% higher than a year earlier; but economists pointed out that the rise was driven by a sharp swing in gas output. Here\u2019s Heather\u2019s story: It\u2019s a blow to attempts to rebalance the UK economy away from the ever-dominant service sector. And economists at Royal Bank of Scotland suggest it could be an impossible task.... Bloomberg\u2019s commodity index, which tracks every significantly traded commodity (coal, oil, gas, coffee, hog futures...) has been dragged down to a 16-year low. Mining giants could be in serious trouble if the iron ore price keeps falling. John Kovacs, senior commodities economist at Capital Economics in London, says producers will be desperate to see the price rise back over $40 per tonne pronto. He reckons that the most expensive operations at the four largest suppliers are on the verge of making losses at rates below $40 a metric ton Kovacs warned: \u201cThe big four will find it hard to maintain output at below $40. \u201cIf prices remain weak, output from the highest-cost mines of the big four will be under pressure.\u201d Bloomberg has more details: The slump in the iron ore price reflects falling demand for steel in China. And that could become a bigger problem - as surveys suggests that China\u2019s factory sector is still struggling, pushing prices down. Paul Bartholomew, Platts managing editor of steel and steel raw materials, has warned that it could be a bleak winter for the industry: \u201cSteel market conditions in China continue to deteriorate and weak domestic demand has been exacerbated by the onset of cold winter weather, which heralds a slowdown in construction activity.\u201d Iron ore has hit its lowest level in a decade, according to new industry data today. Reuters has the details: Benchmark 62-percent grade iron ore for delivery to China\u2019s Tianjin port fell 1.3% to $38.90 a tonne on Monday, according to The Steel Index (TSI), falling for a seventh straight day. It was the lowest on record by TSI since it began collecting data in 2008. Under the annual pricing regime that preceded the spot-based system, it was the lowest since 2005, based on data compiled by Goldman Sachs. This chart shows prices going back to 2008, confirming that prices are lower than in the financial crisis: Today\u2019s selloff follows the 6.8% decline in Chinese exports reported today; a sign that global demand is weak. And it is reflected in today\u2019s slump in mining shares, with many firms tumbling around 5%. It also highlights why the cutbacks announced today are needed (with Anglo American is suspending its dividend, and Rio Tinto slashing capital expenditure). The crash in iron ore is even more severe than in oil. Iron ore was trading at $190 per tonne in early 2011, so has lost 80% of its value since. Kit Juckes, currency strategist at French Bank Societe Generale, believes iron ore could remain in the firing line. Once the post-OPEC concern about a lack of storage and on-going excess supply fade, there\u2019s a good chance that oil will continue to out-perform iron ore, which is obviously more tied to the (soggy) Chinese economic outlook. Lord Browne, the former boss of BP, is discussing the situation on Bloomberg TV (who are all over the commodities story today) He says he wasn\u2019t surprised that Opec failed to agree any production cuts at its acrimonious meeting last Friday. Opec is being consistent with the view that it will continue to maintain market share, keep producing, and see what other people do, explains Lord Browne, adding: In the end it is about Opec. It is the only swing producer, and it\u2019s looking to protect its market share. John Browne (as he then was) ran BP from 1995 to 2007, during which time he saw oil rise from $10 per barrel over $100 per barrel. And that taught him that it \u201creally is impossible\u201d to predict how the price of crude will change. It is a foolish business to be in. The problem, he continues, is that when the price of oil goes up, people think that everything is possible. So they stop thinking about the price of a barrel of oil and start fixating on the volume of a barrel of oil, trying to get as much out as fast as possible. So, could oil hit $20 per barrel, asks host Jonathan Ferro: Nothing is impossible, in the short term, Browne replies. In the long run, $20 is probably wrong, but that\u2019s as far as I\u2019d go. Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, also reckons that more mining giants may suspend shareholder payments, following Anglo\u2019s lead today. Commodity prices continue to fall, looking like they\u2019d prefer to be back in the ground themselves and Anglo American (AAL) is the latest of the mining majors to capitulate and suspend dividends. Following hot on the heels of Glencore (GLEN) which is racing to cut debt and also decided to deprive loyal investors of income for a while, the question is whether we are set to see a rush of others doing the same to protect balance sheets in the face of tanking material prices and much reduced demand. With AAL and GLEN shares -70% YTD, is BHP Billiton (BLT), down 47% over the same period, next in the firing line? How bad could the commodity crunch get? Claus Vistesen, economist at Pantheon Economics, reckons that we could see some energy companies actually collapse: Andy Lynch of Schroder is more optimistic - he believes this might be a good moment to start buying into mining shares. But be cautious! He\u2019s not calling the bottom of the market. He says: The pain is now widespread, with lots of shares down 60 to 70% this year. The world is still going to need some iron ore, we\u2019re still going to want some gold, and these are the companies who are going to produce it for us. So, if you start \u2018layering in\u2019 by buying small amounts of shares, regularly, then over the next 12 to 18 months you\u2019ll find the bottom of the market, Lynch argues. The London stock market\u2019s mining sector is now at its lowest level in over 10 years, as every company is hit by the deepening selloff: Oil companies could be forced to follow Anglo American\u2019s lead and cut their own payments to shareholders. That\u2019s according to Andy Lynch of Schroder Investment Management, who is discussing the commodity crash on Bloomberg TV now. He says that oil producers will have to rethink their plans if the oil price remains around $40 per barrel. Some of them will have to start looking at whether the dividend is sustainable, or try the old trick of moving to paying the dividend partly in cash and partly in shares. Sheesh... Anglo American\u2019s shares have now tumbled by over 8% this morning to a fresh record low. The slump in iron ore and oil prices could deliver a new dose of deflation to advanced economies. Jeremy Cook, economist at World First, warns that prices may have further to fall. He writes: Both oil and iron ore prices took a substantial beating yesterday, dragging commodity currencies lower and increasing the fears of additional deflationary pressures through developed economies in the coming year. OPEC\u2019s decision to hold production at current levels on Friday, keeping the supply glut in essence, alongside continually poor economic data from the developing world has maintained the double-whammy of disappointment for commodities in general. Demand is weak and supply is massive; prices are coming lower with some business pages talking about oil at $20 a barrel. It is currently trading at $37. The outlook for commodities is predicated on growth; grow and demand picks up. The weak growth of the global economy alongside the huge inventory will maintain prices at these low levels for a while one would have to think. We do not where the bottom is, but it is not here. Bad news for mining companies, and countries with large natural resource sectors (such as Australia\u2019s iron ore sector, or Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil interests) But it\u2019s surely welcome for consumers, particularly in countries that are net importers of commodities. It could even give a pre-Christmas boost to household budgets, if cheaper prices are passed on. After yesterday\u2019s tonking, the oil price has gained around 0.5% today. A barrel of US crude oil is trading at $37.86, up 21 cents. And Brent crude, which hit near seven-year lows yesterday, is up 34 cents at $41.07. That\u2019s still 20% lower than two months ago. Mining shares are dragging the London stock market down in early trading. Anglo American has lost 2.7%, as investors digest the news they won\u2019t get a dividend until 2017 (at the earliest). Other companies are being hit harder, as they feel the impact of relentlessly falling metals prices, which has driven iron ore below $40/tonne. China\u2019s weak trade data is also denting the mood. The steep drop in Chinese imports and exports last month suggests demand for commodities will remain weak. Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct, says iron ore has replaced oil as the number one cause of woes in the City. Reports are circulating suggesting that iron ore spot prices have fallen to the lowest level ever recorded despite a marked jump in Chinese imports and this sentiment is certainly being priced in with the heavyweight miners scattered across the foot of the index. The iron ore price has fallen further today, losing another 1% to $39.06. It has shed almost 40% this year, which is one reason that Anglo American has been forced to announce such drastic cuts. Kieron Hodgson, mining analyst at City firm Panmure Gordon, has told Bloomberg TV that he expects other mining companies to follow Anglo American\u2019s lead and suspend their dividends too. Another troubled mining company is making major changes, in an attempt to ride out the commodity slump. Anglo American, which produces iron ore, manganese, coal, copper and nickel, has just announced details of a \u201cradical portfolio restructuring\u201d, which will cut costs and boost productivity. Here\u2019s the statement. It will see Anglo cut its number of assets by around 60%. Mark Cutifani, Anglo American\u2019s CEO, calls it \u201can accelerated and more aggressive strategic restructuring of the portfolio\u201d. Anglo will now focus on assets that are \u201cbest placed to deliver free cash flow through the cycle\u201d and provide long-term value. In a blow to investors, the company is also suspending its dividend for the second half of this financial year, and for 2016 too. Here\u2019s the key points from its statement: Focus on Priority 1 assets to deliver free cash flow and greater returns through the cycle - number of assets to be reduced by ~60% Corporate structures and overhead to be aligned to future portfolio Consolidate from six to three businesses: De Beers, Industrial Metals, Bulk Commodities There is one piece of good news this morning - Japan isn\u2019t in recession after all. Updated GDP data shows that the Japanese economy expanded by an annualised rate of 1% in the last quarter. Encouragingly, business investment was stronger than expected, suggesting prime minister Shinzo Abe\u2019s plan to end deflation and spur growth may not be failing. The commodity crash has forced Rio Tinto to slash its spending plans, in a signal that the sector is hunkering down. Rio, which is the world\u2019s second-largest miner after BHP Billiton, is cutting up to $1bn off its capital expenditure bill for 2016, in the face of falling metals prices. It has also lopped off around $500m off this year\u2019s bill. The FT\u2019s Peter Campbell explains: It expects total capital expenditure in 2016 will be around $5bn, compared to previous forecasts of less than $6bn. It previously cut this year\u2019s budget from $5.5bn to $5bn. Chief executive Sam Walsh said the company \u201cremained focused on investing in only the best quality projects\u201d. Shares in the world\u2019s largest mining companies have slumped to their lowest levels since the financial crisis, or even earlier. The latest falls in the prices of iron ore, oil, copper, zinc and other commodities is further bad news to a sector that has already suffered a year to forget. Shares in BHP Billiton tumbled by over 5% in Australian trading, to their lowest point since summer 2005. Fellow Anglo-Australian miner Rio Tinto shed over 4.2%, to levels last seen in 2009 after the collapse of Lehman Brothers. This wiped 3.5% off the value of Australia\u2019s basic materials index, while the energy sector lost 6%. New trade data from China has reinforced fears over its slowing economy. Chinese exports shrank by 6.8% year-on-year in November. That\u2019s a bigger fall than expected, and the fifth monthly decline in a row. Imports also fell, by 8.7%, for the 13th straight month running. It indicates weak domestic demand in China. The news hit stock markets in Asia, driving indices down to three-week lows. China\u2019s Shanghai index led the rout, down almost 2%. Chinese manufacturing is struggling as Beijing attempts the tricky job of rebalancing towards a more service-driven economy. Kinger Lau, chief China strategist at Goldman Sachs, told a briefing in Hong Kong that: \u201cInvestors will remain quite sceptical about the true growth conditions of China which will mean that sentiment will remain quite fragile going into 2016.\u201d (via Reuters) Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Today, we\u2019ll be tracking the commodity rout that began in Europe yesterday. The oil price is currently bobbing around its lowest level since early 2009, after Monday\u2019s rout send Brent crude down towards $40/barrel. With iron ore prices also falling steeply, there are growing concerns about the Michael Hewson of CMC Markets sets the scene: Iron ore prices slipped further below $40 a ton yesterday and with no evidence of a base in sight, this in turn is likely to turn the screws further on a highly leveraged mining sector. At the beginning of this year Sam Walsh CEO of Australian giant Rio Tinto asserted that the prospect of $30 a ton iron ore was in the realms of fantasy land, and would never be reached. Given that we are now $9 away this fantasy could well be about to turn into a nightmare. We have new economic data from the UK and the eurozone today: 9.30am: UK manufacturing and production output for October 10am: Eurozone GDP for the third quarter, final estimate (likely to confirm the eurozone grew by 0.3%) 3pm: The NIESR thinktank will publish its estimate for the UK\u2019s GDP in September-November quarter And European finance ministers are gathering in Brussels for an Ecofin meeting. Last night, the eurogroup of eurozone ministers did their best to chivy Greece along to keep implementing its bailout programme: We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day...",

Even a revival in the oil price - Brent crude is currently down 0.9% at $40.34 a barrel after earlier falling as low as $39.81 - failed to make much impact. (<em>Although it did help BP become, surprisingly, just one of two risers in the UK market, the other being a rather more defensive stock in the form of Sainsbury).</em></p> <p>Anglo American\u2019s decision to scrap its dividend sent its shares moire than 12% lower and, with weak Chinese trade data, helped push mining shares lower. Iron ore fell for the seventh day in a row, down another 1.2% to $38.9, the lowest level since the Steel Index began in 2008. The final scores showed:</p> <ul> <li><strong>The FTSE 100 fell 1.42% or 88.30 points to 6135.22</strong></li> <li><strong>Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 1.95% to 10,673.60</strong></li> <li><strong>France\u2019s Cac closed 1.57% lower at 4681.86</strong></li> <li><strong>Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB lost 2.26% to 21,538.04</strong></li> <li><strong>Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 2.04% at 9837.1</strong></li> <li><strong>In Greece, the Athens market finished 4.43% lower at 581.90</strong></li> </ul> <p>On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is now down 169 points or 0.95%.</p> <p><em>On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening.

There is also the worry that this sets a precedent for the rest of the sectors. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Today\u2019s decision from Anglo American to scrap its dividend is likely to be the beginning of a worrying trend for the miners. The attractiveness of owning oil or mining shares has been questionable of late and with the prospect of dividends also being scrapped, the sector is fast running out of reasons to invest. The selloff seen across FTSE commodities stocks highlights the flock to dividend safety with Anglo American likely to be the first of many firms sacrificing its dividend.</p> </blockquote> <p>He also highlights the forthcoming Chinese inflation figures due overnight and points out that, in a return to the old bad news is good news mantra, a weak reading could be a benefit:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The commodities sector will be back in focus tomorrow, following the release of Chinese CPI data.

      "bodyText": "Anglo American has suspended its dividend and announced plans to cut its workforce by 85,000 and dispose of more than half its mines in response to the plunging price of iron ore and other metals. The UK mining company said it would not pay a dividend for the second half of this year and all of next year. The last time Anglo American cut its dividend was during the worst of the financial crisis in 2009. In a presentation to investors, Anglo American said it would sell or close up to 35 mines, leaving it with about 20 sites and cutting employee and contractor numbers from 135,000 to fewer than 50,000 after 2017. It will halve the number of business units from six to three: the De Beers diamond operation, industrial metals and bulk commodities. The company, which mines materials such as iron ore, manganese, coal, copper and nickel, said it would cut capital spending by a further $1bn (\u00a3670m) to the end of 2016, taking the reduction in capital spending to $2.9bn by the end of 2017. It increased the amount it plans to raise from asset sales to $4bn from $3bn. The plan is the biggest restructuring by a mining company in reaction to the commodities rout. Prices have plunged because of slowing world economic growth and falling demand from China, the world\u2019s biggest consumer of iron ore, copper, nickel and most other commodities. Anglo American\u2019s shares, which have lost almost three-quarters of their value this year, fell more than 12% to a new all-time low of 323p. Its announcement sent all other mining shares down in London with the sector at a 10-year low. The biggest mining companies are slashing spending and cutting costs to protect their financial strength as metal prices plunge. Glencore, the British miner and commodities trader, has suspended its dividend and is selling assets to cut its debt in an effort to rebuild investor confidence. Anglo American has been affected more severely by the commodities crash than some of its rivals because of its reliance on iron ore, whose value has fallen by almost 40% this year as demand from China has fallen. The iron ore price fell 1% on Tuesday to $39.06 a metric tonne \u2013 the first time it has gone below $40 since real-time pricing started in 2008. Analysts said most producers\u2019 iron ore operations would become loss making if prices stayed below $40 for long. Rio Tinto, the British-Australian miner, also announced a near-$1bn reduction in capital spending for next year, slashing planned investment to $5bn from $8bn in 2014. Its shares fell 5% to \u00a319.60. The companies are responding to a widespread fall in commodities that sent the price of oil to a seven-year low on Tuesday. Mark Cutifani, chief executive of Anglo American, said: \u201cTogether with the additional material capital, cost saving and productivity measures announced today, we are setting out an accelerated and more aggressive strategic restructuring of the portfolio to focus it around our priority one assets. \u201cWhile we have continued to deliver our business restructuring and performance objectives across the board, the severity of commodity price deterioration requires bolder action.\u201d Anglo American\u2019s biggest business is in Africa, where it had about 76,000 permanent employees last year, followed by Latin America with more than 11,000 workers. The company did not say where the asset sales or job cuts would fall but Cutifani said Anglo American would focus on diamonds, platinum and copper, which have better long-term returns. \u201cAssets in nickel, coal and iron ore will have to compete and demonstrate their ability to drive down the cost curve, with the ability to deliver cash through the cycle. If not, they won\u2019t be in the portfolio. It\u2019s as simple as that,\u201d Cutifani said. He said Anglo American would spell out details of its plans in February when it publishes its annual results. Mike van Dulken, head of research at the spread-betting firm Accendo Markets, said other miners could follow Anglo American\u2019s lead by cutting or scrapping their dividends. \u201cThe question is whether we are set to see a rush of others doing the same to protect balance sheets in the face of tanking material prices and much reduced demand.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Imperial Tobacco shares have been supported in recent weeks by renewed talk of a possible bid for the cigarette company. Rivals BAT and Japan Tobacco have been mentioned as possible predators but analysts at Barclays, while agreeing there are strategic attractions in such a move, have concluded that a bid may not happen in the short term. They said: The current speculation follows recent consolidation in global beer and has reignited a debate that has been around for a number of years, namely: will the multi-national tobacco industry consolidate from four to three. We [conclude] that despite the longer-term strategic rationale, a short-term move is unlikely. After the strong 26% and 14% outperformance against the market and staples [sector] in the year to date, a tough first quarter trading print ahead and concerns around plain packaging regulation in France and the UK likely to intensify in the near-term, Imperial shares may be due a pause for breath. However, with many investors suffering from FoMO syndrome (fear of missing out), M&amp;A share price support is unlikely to be extinguished any time soon and we reiterate our equalweight on Imperial Tobacco. As far as the reasoning behind a bid is concerned, Barclays said: The industrial rationale for Imperial being acquired is strong: with a 5% or so global share, the group is the smallest of the big international tobacco companies and is just half the size of global number three Japan Tobacco. Imperial also over-indexes in the still fragmented European region, providing scope for a potential acquirer (or acquirers) to benefit from in-market consolidation synergies and more effective route-to-market leverage. Previous tobacco industry M&amp;A has driven cost savings of between 6% and 15% as a percentage of acquired sales and our analysis suggests earnings accretion of 3% to 16% in year three if BAT were to take over the group. Moreover, many investors highlight that when it comes to consolidation, although it is impossible to predict the exact timing, there is \u201cno smoke without fire.\u201d In staples, Scottish &amp; Newcastle, Allied Domecq and Gallagher were subject to up to a decade of take-over speculation, but eventually all were acquired. So the question remains, why now? A number of factors point against a deal being imminent in our view: 1) Imperial\u2019s share price is at all- time highs; 2) Imperial\u2019s \u00a34.6bn acquisition of US assets is arguably a hindrance rather than attraction to potentially interested parties like BAT and Japan Tobacco; 3) Structuring a deal may be complex, with anti-trust issues likely to require the divestment of individual markets and/or brand licenses; 4) Both BAT and Japan Tobacco have actively pursued their own M&amp;A agendas over the past 12 months. BAT has spent $7.9bn reinforcing its ownership of Reynolds and buying out the Souza Cruz minorities in Brazil, while Japan Tobacco recently spent around $5bn on the international rights to Natural American Spirit. As a result, balance sheet leverage is now 2.6 times at BAT, above the top-end of its 1.5 to 2.5 times target range; 5) Although earnings accretion on a deal may be attractive for BAT, sizeable accretion could simply be derived from reinstating a share buyback programme; 6) Our analysis suggests generating returns above weighted average cost of capital could take 6 to 7 years. Economic value added factors have not stopped consolidation in beer, but a BAT/Imperial deal is hardly compelling on this metric. Imperial shares are currently up 5p at \u00a335.63.",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s manufacturers cut back output by 0.4% in October, partly reversing a strong performance the previous month, and underlining warnings of a tough winter for the sector. Official figures showed that while George Osborne has pledged to unleash a \u201cmarch of the makers\u201d, manufacturing output in October stood 0.1% lower than the same month in 2014 \u2013 and remains 6.1% below its pre-recession peak. Overall industrial production, which includes mining and utilities, as well as manufacturing, increased just 0.1% in October on the previous month, and 1.7% higher than a year earlier; but economists pointed out that the rise was driven by a sharp swing in gas output. \u201cIndustrial production only edged up in October due to erratic movements in its volatile components,\u201d said Samuel Tombs, UK economist at Pantheon Macro. \u201cThe 0.4% month-to-month fall in core manufacturing output is another sign that the strong pound is starting to stifle the economic recovery, and the continued weakness of the manufacturing surveys suggest further falls lie ahead.\u201d Manufacturing body the EEF has warned that conditions in the sector are tough, with the recent appreciation of sterling, and the slowdown in emerging economies, including China, undermining demand. The continued weakness of commodity prices has also hit industry, with many firms reliant on supplying or servicing the North Sea oil sector. Zach Witton, deputy chief economist at EEF, the manufacturers\u2019 organisation, said: \u201cLooking forward, industry will remain under pressure from the low oil price and weak export demand flowing from slower growth in emerging markets.\u201d The ONS said manufacture of some machinery and equipment had been the biggest contributor to the decline in output; while other sectors, including pharmaceuticals, had performed more strongly. Howard Archer, of IHS Global Insight, said the renewed weakness of industry suggested Britain\u2019s recovery would continue to rely on the dominant services sector. \u201cWhat is clear is that fourth-quarter GDP growth is once again going to be highly dependent on the services sector,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "Leading shares are on the slide as the commodity rout continues, but supermarket shares are bucking the downward trend. Sainsbury is up 9.8p at 251.5p, Tesco is 5.75p better at 162.75p and Morrisons is up 3.6p at 149.3p despite Exane BNP Paribas cutting its target price on all three. Investors are taking heart from slightly better food sales in the latest British Retail Consortium figures. Analysts at Jefferies said: Food sales are still in decline as customers shop around. Food like for like sales in November saw some marginal improvement but still fell 1.1% we estimate, an improvement on the -1.4% three month and year to date trend. But competitive pressures show little signs of letting up, with seven out of ten shoppers saying they would do their Christmas shopping at the discounters, Jefferies said. However Stifel analysts were positive on the big four supermarkets (the three quoted companies plus Asda): UK food retail share prices are back near relative lows, with the first half\u2019s optimism eroded by second half macro industry data showing very weak spending trends and Big 4 recovery efforts stalling. We think there is some room for shorter-term optimism as a number of the structural pressures driving Big 4 share loss should ease over the key Christmas trading period. Moreover, sector share prices look well-underpinned by free cash flow metrics. The slump in oil prices after Friday\u2019s disappointing and inconclusive Opec meeting has lifted airline shares, on the basis that they should face cheaper fuel costs. Even though Brent crude has recovered 0.7% to $41.02 after Monday\u2019s slide, British Airways owner International Airlines Group is up 11p at 598p and easyJet is 18p better at \u00a317.23. Overall though, shares are dropping again, with the FTSE 100 down 33.15 points at 6190.37. Mining shares are leading the fallers after disappointing Chinese trade data, and continuing declines in the price of iron ore. Anglo American is down 29.35p or 7% at 339.65p after it unveiled a restructuring and suspended its dividend payments to shareholders. BHP Billiton has dropped 40.3p to 724.9p as it faced a civil lawsuit following a dam burst in Brazil last month. Glencore has fallen 4.68p to 80.68p while Rio Tinto is down 103p at \u00a319.63. But GlaxoSmithkline has edged up 0.5p to 313.24, shrugging off reports of a delay to a Japanese launch. Dr Tara Raveendran at Shore Capital said: Glaxo has delayed the launch of its hair loss drug Zagallo (dutasteride) in Japan following the closure of a French plant by its supplier Catalent, amidst concerns around product tampering. US-based Catalent manufactures Zagallo, a treatment for alopecia, which is approved only in Japan. Catalent halted production at the plant last month following a request from US regulators after evidence suggested that someone in the plant had purposely mixed the wrong capsules into batches. This is second time Glaxo has suffered supply issues in Japan in recent months - earlier in the year Glaxo had issues with the supply of its hepatitis B treatment Tenozet in Japan, after an explosion in a nearby chemical warehouse in September damaged the production plant in China. Among the mid-caps TV distributor Entertainment One continued to fall in the wake of a successful \u00a3285m bond issue on Friday, down nearly 10% at 159.1p. Investec remained positive, saying: Shares are down on possible short and stop loss activity after what looks an expensive debt refinance. However, our Investec debt analysts suggest this is not an unreasonable rate for a B+ credit rating. The refinance also extends term and financing visibility in a rising interest rate environment with more balance sheet flexibility for growth. But Peel Hunt cut its rating from hold to reduce, saying: It doesn\u2019t seem long ago that the company commentary on funding was that senior debt would be extinguished in the near future. Here we are with the creation of a seven-year \u00a3285m senior note. The cost of this is significantly above the debt it replaces. This refi package follows on from the rights issue that funded the additional Peppa Pig acquisition and raised an additional \u00a360m on top. And still we expect Entertainment One to be free cash flow negative in aggregate over the next three years.",

The group, whose products include Corgi Cars and Airfix kits, also struggled to get products into European stores from its Chinese supplier. The pre-tax loss for the six months to the end of September widened from \u00a3520,000 a year earlier as sales fell to \u00a322.3m from \u00a324.2m. Excluding exceptional items, Hornby swung to a \u00a33.4m loss from a \u00a3250,000 profit a year earlier. Hornby has been upgrading its computer and stock management systems in the UK and Europe while bringing in new managers. The revamp caused UK sales to fall sharply over the summer and affected Hornby\u2019s European business, which was also hit by problems getting products made in China on to shelves. The group has had trouble with its Chinese suppliers for many years after moving production from the UK in the late 90s. After extricating itself from a long-running contract, it had further problems this year and issued profit warnings in September and November. Hornby said it was looking for additional manufacturers in China and elsewhere and that it would open a new warehouse in China to give it greater control over suppliers. In the UK, business has recovered from the summer disruption and sales are rising, Hornby said.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The accelerating rout in commodity prices has piled pressure on energy and resources shares in Asia Pacific amid more signs of slowing demand from China. Although oil prices pushed back on Tuesday from seven-year lows, stock markets around the region felt the pain from uncertainty about global growth and the likely rise in US interest rates later this month. The Nikkei index in Japan was down almost 1% on Tuesday and the Shanghai Composite and Hang Seng indices were down more 0.9% and 1.6% respectively. In resource-rich Australia, the ASX/S&amp;P200 benchmark had a volaltile day but bears had the upper hand by the afternoon with the index off 0.91% at the close with the big oil and gas and mining companies bearing the brunt. \u201cBeyond the December hike, investors are concerned about the lack of Chinese demand which is acting as a millstone around the neck of risky assets and most investors will stay away until they see a clearer direction on rates,\u201d said Cliff Tan, east Asian head of global markets at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ in Hong Kong. Data showed on Tuesday that China\u2019s exports fell by a more-than-expected 6.8% in November from a year earlier, their fifth straight month of decline. Imports fell 8.7%, which was not as much as expected but enough to signal continued weak demand from the world\u2019s second biggest economy. Analysts were unsure if the numbers signalled a possible improvement in Chinese domestic demand, which has been a key factor in driving world commodity prices to multi-year lows. \u201cThe big picture hasn\u2019t really changed that much. The US is doing okay, but the problems with emerging markets are really quite big,\u201d said Kevin Lai, chief economist Asia Ex-Japan at Daiwa Capital Markets in Hong Kong. \u201cImports have been slumping for more than a year now, so the year-on-year figures are benefiting from a much lower base, which statistically we should expect. But I\u2019m not so sure the number today reflects a real fundamental change for the better in import demand.\u201d Brent crude futures were up 27c at $41 a barrel on Tuesday morning, lifting from the seven-year lows reached on Monday. US crude was trading at $37.77 a barrel at 0300 GMT, up 12c from its last settlement. Opec\u2019s decision to keep production at near-record levels in an oversupplied market has spooked investors grappling with reduced demand from China, the world\u2019s biggest energy consumer. The decline in oil has spilled over into other industrial commodities with iron ore continuing its fall below the $40 per tonne barrier to $38.90. Copper steadied its slump thanks to the slightly better China import numbers but nickel and aluminium prices were weaker. Underlining the cautious outlook for China, a Reuters poll of Japanese firms showed deep pessimism about near-term Chinese growth prospects, with 79% saying they do not expect to expand business there next year. Japan\u2019s Nikkei had earlier bucked the trend ojn other markets, rising 0.3% before turning lower on the day, after revised data showed Japan had dodged a recession in the third quarter, with GDP up an annualised 1%, compared to a preliminary reading of a 0.8% fall. Australia, whose three biggest exports are iron ore, coal and natural gas, felt the pain sharply in its large resource sectors. BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto, who along with the Brazilian company Vale, dominate the iron ore trade to China, were sold. BHP, which is also listed in the UK, fell more than 5% to a fresh 10-year low of $17.05. Rio was off more than 4%. \u201cThe selling has really turned up and the energy and materials sectors are getting slammed,\u201d said Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist at trading firm CMC Markets. The strengthening of the US dollar ahead of a likely Fed rate hike put pressure on the Australian dollar which fell 0.5% to US72.22c.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Owners of heavily polluting diesel generators stand to make \u201csky-high\u201d profits under a government energy regime that has slashed subsidies for wind and solar, a report warns. The annual capacity market auction \u2013 under which power suppliers bid for contracts to feed electricity into the grid \u2013 is due to begin on Tuesday. Calculations by the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) suggest \u201cdiesel farm\u201d owners can expect to make millions if they succeed with bids to supply 1.5 gigawatts. They could be awarded subsidies of up to \u00a3434m in the capacity market, up from \u00a3109m last year, which the IPPR said would trigger a \u201crapid proliferation\u201d of diesel farms. In a report entitled Mad Maths, the thinktank said a typical 24MW diesel installation could deliver a pre-tax profit of nearly \u00a31m a year, thanks to the subsidies and their low costs of operation. That spells a return on investment of about 23%, the IPPR said, or up to 38% for firms that have already qualified for tax relief. It warned that this meant taxpayers would be subsidising profits for \u201cthe dirtiest form of energy generation available, worse even than coal\u201d. The riches on offer are in sharp contrast to the treatment of renewable power sources such as wind and solar. The Department of Energy and Climate Change deems returns of between 5% and 8% appropriate for renewable energy. The energy secretary, Amber Rudd, has slashed subsidies for solar power \u2013 known as the feed-in tariff \u2013 by 87%, instead throwing her weight behind gas. Criticism of the government\u2019s stance on polluting power sources comes as the UK joins other major economies in Paris to thrash out a global climate settlement. The IPPR warned further support for diesel would hamper the UK\u2019s role in reducing CO2 emissions. \u201cIn the same week that world leaders are in Paris negotiating a climate deal, the UK government is handing out new subsidies to the most polluting form of electricity generation available,\u201d said IPPR\u2019s senior research fellow, Jimmy Aldridge. \u201cThis is allowing sky-high returns for diesel investors but terrible value for money for consumers. In the long term it is also damaging UK energy security because it is preventing investment in the smarter, cleaner technologies that we really need to keep the lights on.\u201d The IPPR recommended that diesel generators be excluded from future capacity market auctions, under which contracts can last up to 15 years. It also urged the government to place restrictions on emissions by those companies that have already secured subsidies. This would include forcing them to fit new technology to mitigate air pollutants and restricting the running hours of the most polluting generators. Greenpeace lashed out at the direction that the Conservative government\u2019s energy policy has taken. \u201cThe same ministers purporting to help consumers by slashing support for the cleanest energy sources are forcing them to pay millions to one of the dirtiest,\u201d said Greenpeace\u2019s head of energy, Daisy Sands. \u201cSubsidising highly polluting diesel generators to keep the lights on doesn\u2019t add up to an energy policy. Ministers need to come up with a long-term plan to help build a smart, clean, flexible energy infrastructure that\u2019s fit for a 21st-century advanced economy like Britain.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "UK retailers suffered a drop in sales in November as record take-up of online shopping and a late Black Friday boost failed to make up for slow trade in the rest of the month. Retailers will be hoping Christmas food and gift shopping will turn things around after sales in stores and online were down 0.4% in like-for-like terms in November when compared with a year earlier, according to the British Retail Consortium (BRC). For non-food products, one in every five pounds was spent online in November, the BRC said. At 22.4% the online penetration rate for non-food was the highest since the group started publishing internet sales data in late 2012, up 2.1 percentage points on November 2014. Online record Early indications from the Black Friday shopping weekend, when UK retailers follow the US tradition of flash sales, suggest it was an online event this year. The BRC said online sales of non-food products for the month as a whole grew 11.8% on a year earlier. The pattern appears to have extended into December, separate data released on Monday shows. Footfall in UK stores in the week to 6 December was down 2.7% on the year, according to the research firm Springboard. \u201cLeading into Christmas, we expect to see online shopping continue to make dents in footfall activity,\u201d said Diane Wehrle, Springboard\u2019s marketing and insights director. \u201cHowever, as most last-order dates for online Christmas shopping occur on 18 and 19 December, it is possible we will see that traditional spike in footfall on 23 December as consumers head in-store for last-minute Christmas buying.\u201d The BRC said unseasonably warm weather added to pressures in November. Mild temperatures hurt sales of clothing, winter foods and thick duvets but it boosted the gardening and DIY category. Other segments of the market struggled to grow their sales values as prices continued to fall. Web sales of appliances soar The BRC\u2019s chief executive, Helen Dickinson, said the furniture and home categories were the main drivers of growth in November, with electrical appliances doing particularly well from Black Friday offers, but that the month was slow overall. The rise of online sales was disrupting traditional pre-Christmas patterns, she added. \u201cThis buildup to Christmas is one of the hardest to read in years,\u201d said Dickinson. She also echoed economists in warning that after years of squeezed household budgets, a recent recovery in wages would not necessarily translate into higher spending. \u201cThe conversion of people\u2019s higher disposable income into retail sales shouldn\u2019t be taken for granted,\u201d Dickinson added. The BRC\u2019s suggestion that people held off spending ahead of Black Friday on 27 November was echoed by figures from Barclaycard showing a slowdown in the first three weeks of the month. The number of purchases made in the period slowed in all categories, compared with the previous month, with the exception of cinema and theatre sales, according to company, which processes nearly half of all UK card transactions. The sharpest slowdowns were in categories widely expected to see big Black Friday discounts, including clothing, DIY, electronics and furniture. Reports from the retail industry have repeatedly highlighted pressure on margins as shoppers grow accustomed to discounts following the downturn and supermarket price war. The BRC\u2019s own figures on shop prices published last week showed record deflation last month. November had again seen consumers and retailers engaging in a game of chicken, said David McCorquodale, head of retail at KPMG, the co-authors of the BRC report. \u201cNovember\u2019s relatively flat sales figures are a reality check for the retail sector with consumers holding off for a Black Friday bargain pitted against retailers determined to hold onto their hard-earned margins,\u201d he said. With the figures unadjusted for store openings and closures during the year, sales were up 0.7% in November, below the average growth rate for the last 12 months of 1.7%, the BRC said. Trade could yet bounce back in December, said Howard Archer, economist at the consultancy IHS Global Insight. \u201cThere still seems to be a fair chance that this will end up being a decent Christmas for retailers given consumers\u2019 improved purchasing power,\u201d Archer said before the BRC figures were published.",

At 22.4% the online penetration rate for non-food was the highest since the group started publishing internet sales data in late 2012, up 2.1 percentage points on November 2014. </p> <h2>Online record</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9e2226a170c868faf73d598c34d32d687583a364\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/12/7/1449505711860/90f1f009-673d-4d58-bc82-1f71bf686fc3-460x278.png\" alt=\"Total Non-Food sales: weighted Online penetration\" width=\"460\" height=\"278\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The chart shows the rising proportion of non-food sales that were online, with a record 22.4% for November 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: BRC-KPMG RSM</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Early indications from the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/04/john-lewis-black-friday-record-sales-online\">Black Friday shopping weekend</a>, when UK retailers follow the US tradition of flash sales, suggest it was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/nov/30/cyber-monday-black-friday-online-shopping\">an online event this year</a>. The BRC said online sales of non-food products for the month as a whole grew 11.8% on a year earlier.</p> <p>The pattern appears to have extended into December, separate data released on Monday shows. Footfall in UK stores in the week to 6 December was down 2.7% on the year, according to the research firm Springboard.</p> <p>\u201cLeading into Christmas, we expect to see online shopping continue to make dents in footfall activity,\u201d said Diane Wehrle, Springboard\u2019s marketing and insights director. \u201cHowever, as most last-order dates for online Christmas shopping occur on 18 and 19 December, it is possible we will see that traditional spike in footfall on 23 December as consumers head in-store for last-minute Christmas buying.\u201d</p> <p>The BRC said unseasonably warm weather added to pressures in November. Mild temperatures hurt sales of clothing, winter foods and thick duvets but it boosted the gardening and DIY category. Other segments of the market struggled to grow their sales values as prices continued to fall. <br></p> <h2>Web sales of appliances soar</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"54eb4113c616181eacbc91766b711c4bf615d10c\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/12/7/1449505547863/6d843e63-3210-4144-a66a-d20e0113bb8c-460x274.png\" alt=\"Online penetration rates \" width=\"460\" height=\"274\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Two in every \u00a35 spent on household appliances in November came from online sales.

The rise of online sales was disrupting traditional pre-Christmas patterns, she added.</p> <p>\u201cThis buildup to Christmas is one of the hardest to read in years,\u201d said Dickinson.</p> <p>She also echoed economists in warning that after years of squeezed household budgets, a recent recovery in wages would not necessarily translate into higher spending. \u201cThe conversion of people\u2019s higher disposable income into retail sales shouldn\u2019t be taken for granted,\u201d Dickinson added.</p> <p>The BRC\u2019s suggestion that people held off spending ahead of Black Friday on 27 November was echoed by figures from Barclaycard showing a slowdown in the first three weeks of the month. The number of purchases made in the period slowed in all categories, compared with the previous month, with the exception of cinema and theatre sales, according to company, which processes nearly half of all UK card transactions. </p> <p>The sharpest slowdowns were in categories widely expected to see big Black Friday discounts, including clothing, DIY, electronics and furniture.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/ng-interactive/2015/nov/19/christmas-gift-guide-2015-shopping-buy-online\">Christmas gift guide 2015</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Reports from the retail industry have repeatedly highlighted pressure on margins as shoppers grow accustomed to discounts following the downturn and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jun/08/supermarket-price-war-britain\">supermarket price war</a>. The BRC\u2019s own figures on shop prices published last week showed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/02/uk-shop-prices-fall-by-record-amount-in-november\">record deflation last month</a>.</p> <p>November had again seen consumers and retailers engaging in a game of chicken, said David McCorquodale, head of retail at KPMG, the co-authors of the BRC report. \u201cNovember\u2019s relatively flat sales figures are a reality check for the retail sector with consumers holding off for a Black Friday bargain pitted against retailers determined to hold onto their hard-earned margins,\u201d he said.</p> <p>With the figures unadjusted for store openings and closures during the year, sales were up 0.7% in November, below the average growth rate for the last 12 months of 1.7%, the BRC said.</p> <p>Trade could yet bounce back in December, said Howard Archer, economist at the consultancy IHS Global Insight. \u201cThere still seems to be a fair chance that this will end up being a decent Christmas for retailers given consumers\u2019 improved purchasing power,\u201d Archer said before the BRC figures were published.</p> <p></p>",
