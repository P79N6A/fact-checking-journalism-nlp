      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all for today. Thank you for following the blog and for all your comments. Please join us again tomorrow. AM With the press conference over, Anna Stupnytska, global economist at Fidelity International, says Powell struck a more doveish tone than expected: The US Federal Reserve hiked rates at the September meeting, as widely expected. The overall tone of the statement was upbeat, although Chairman Powell chose to strike a relatively dovish tone at the press conference, presumably making room for more flexibility around the future policy path given the multitude of uncertainties. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to see much happening at this point\u201d, Powell says, when asked about the impact of trade tensions between the US and China. He says there are areas of concern however: loss of business confidence, which doesn\u2019t appear to gave materialised yet, and financial market reaction over the longer term. The main worry, Powell says, is \u201cwhere is this going?\u201d Powell says the Fed is constantly weighing up the risk between moving too quickly to raise rates and therefore snuffing out the recovery, and moving too slowly, therefore allowing the economy to overheat. That\u2019s why the central bank is moving gradually, he says. Jerome Powell, chairman of the Federal Reserve is giving a press conference. He begins by outlining the strength of the US economy. He says the financial system is now stronger and better placed to deal with a shock than it was pre-crisis. The Fed\u2019s latest growth projections show the US economy continuing at a steady pace through 2019, with GDP growth forecast at 2.5% next year before it slows to 2% in 2020 and to 1.8% in 2021, as the impact of the recent tax cuts and government spending fade. David Herrick, chief executive of Moneycorp\u2019s US business, says the markets had priced in today\u2019s rate hike: The dollar and wider financial markets have had a muted reaction to today\u2019s second straight quarter of dollar-supportive rate rises from the Fed. The market outlook is for these to continue through the final quarter of this year and into 2019 as the economy strengthens. Reaction to the Fed decision by Kully Samra, UK Managing Director of Charles Schwab: This hike follows strong GDP figures for the first half of the year and yet again demonstrates the Fed\u2019s faith that it can continue to raise rates gradually without slowing economic growth. Trade concerns are being counter-balanced by wage inflation, with average hourly earnings rising 2.9% year-over-year as of August. These numbers were welcomed in the latest jobs report and crucially do not suggest over-heating, meaning the Fed has little need to crimp economic growth. A December hike seems likely, but the likelihood could ebb and flow depending on incoming economic data between now and then. Here is what the Fed policymakers had to say: Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in August indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been rising at a strong rate. Job gains have been strong, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate has stayed low. Household spending and business fixed investment have grown strongly. On a 12-month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy remain near 2 percent. Indicators of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance. The Committee expects that further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate will be consistent with sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee\u2019s symmetric 2 percent objective over the medium term. Risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced. In view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation, the Committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 2 to 2-1/4 percent. The Fed has removed the key term \u201caccommodative policy\u201d from its accompanying statement, signalling more rate hikes to come. The central bank\u2019s dot plots show 12 of 16 officials favour four rate hikes in 2018, making another US rate rise in December likely. The Federal Reserve has raised US interest rates by 0.25 points, to a range of 2-2.25%, as expected. In other news, the chancellor, Philip Hammond has announced the budget date, which is Monday 29 October. Budgets traditionally take place on a Wednesday, but the chancellor has selected a data to make sure it does not clash with the final stage of Brexit negotiations in November. Investors on both sides of the Atlantic await the US Fed decision tonight, but most will be more interested in the Fed\u2019s \u201cdot plot\u201d, showing where policymakers thinks rates are going in future months. Neil Wilson at markets.com explains: The Federal Reserve will raise rates today \u2013 that much is certain. There is a roughly 95% chance of the fed funds rate moving up to the 2-2.25% target, which means the decision itself is well baked in to market pricing. This would be the third interest rate rise this year and indicators still point firmly towards a fourth by December. Therefore, market attention is on a number of other elements contained in both the projections (dots) and the monetary policy statement. The key question is what monetary policy in 2019 looks like. Currently the median dot plots point to three hikes in 2019 but there are a number of factors that might tempt the Fed to slow its pace next year. The fiscal put should start to lessen, while tariffs could impact on its forecasts for growth. However a lot depends on the extent to which the Fed sees tariffs pushing up prices as well. Similarly, quite why the Fed would slow up its pace of tightening from its June projections seems unclear. The question really is what has changed in the intervening months to make it beat a more dovish drum. The answer is, with the exception of further concerns about trade, precious little. US markets edged higher on the opening bell: Dow Jones: +0.1% at 26,521 S&amp;P 500: +0.1% at 2,918 Nasdaq: +0.1% at 8,017 Carolyn Fairbairn, CBI director-general, says that Labour is thinking up policies that work on paper but not in reality because the party lacks business experience. Responding to Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s closing speech at the Labour Party Conference, Fairburn said: Much of Labour\u2019s vision for a more sustainable and fair country is absolutely right. Business not only supports it but holds many of the keys to making it a reality. From onshore power to affordable childcare, the Labour leader\u2019s speech echoes calls from firms for more action on climate change and to unlock productivity. But this will only happen if Labour invites business into the tent. Continual public barbs and backward-facing policy are deterring entrepreneurs and investors, at a time when we need them most. Profit and enterprise are the basis of jobs and growth, with firms paying enough tax to fund the NHS every year and much more besides. Too often lack of business experience in the Labour Party fuels ideas that are appealing on paper or conference platforms, but unworkable in reality. Far better to take up business\u2019 open offer to work together. Far better to recognise and build on strides already made, from cutting emissions in the power sector by half since 2010 to employee ownership schemes already operating in almost 9 out of 10 FTSE 350 firms. Policy built collaboratively will help build a fair, progressive and pro-enterprise Britain. Policy built on ideology and diktat will do the opposite. They will harm those who can least afford it by driving down investment, productivity and pay. US futures are higher ahead of tonight\u2019s expected Fed rate hike, with bank shares among the gainers. Shares in JP Morgan, Citigroup, Wells Fargo and Bank of America were all up as policymakers prepare to announce what would be the third US rate rise in 2018. Here is how markets look across Europe: FTSE 100: -0.1% at 7,499 Germany\u2019s DAX: -0.2% at 12,346 France\u2019s CAC: 0.3% at 5,493 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: -0.3% at 21,593 Spain\u2019s IBEX: -0.2% at 9,511 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: flat at 384 More on the AA, which has blamed a UK \u201cpothole epidemic\u201d caused by the \u201cbeast from the east\u201d and low road maintenance spending for a sharp fall in half-year profits. The roadside assistance service had to deal with 1.91m breakdowns in the six months to July, up 8% from a year earlier. The AA estimates that potholes are costing drivers and their insurers at least \u00a31m a month due to big car repair bills. The Local Government Association says councils are fixing a pothole every 21 seconds but it will still take more than \u00a39bn and more than a decade to clear the local roads repair backlog completely, after decades of underfunding. The government\u2019s austerity programme since the financial crisis made things worse. Councils have had their real spending power (government funding plus council tax) reduced by 29% between 2010/11 and 2017/18. Simon Breakwell, the AA chief executive, said this morning: We\u2019ve had a 15-year high in breakdowns, we had the worst winter back to back with the hottest summer, all of which causes everyone to drive their cars and more cars on the road generally means more breakdowns. Sometimes you have a rubbish winter and sometimes you have a really hot summer but it\u2019s rare that you have a rubbish winter back to back with the hottest summer. Oil prices have eased off today, but are still on course for a fifth consecutive quarterly gain as Iran sanctions keep prices at near late 2014 highs. Brent crude is down 0.3% or 24 cents at $81.63 a barrel, having risen to $82.55 on Tuesday. Retail sales growth slowed less than expected in September, according to the CBI\u2019s monthly survey of the sector. Of the retailers surveyed, a balance of +23% said sales were up compared with a year ago. That was down from +29% in August, but better than the +16% predicted by City economists. However, the business lobby group cautioned the outlook for retailers was tough in the months ahead, as consumer finances remain under pressure and business costs rise. Anna Leach, CBI head of economic intelligence, said: As we head into Autumn, retailers have seen the run of decent sales figures continue. But underlying conditions are clearly tougher, with the sector facing significant challenges \u2013 from squeezed household incomes, changing consumer habits to digital disruption. So, policymakers must be conscious that times are harder for retailers than recent data suggests. With the burden of business rates stifling investment \u2013 against the backdrop of an already tough trading environment \u2013 the Government must deliver a review of the system over the coming year. A Fed rate hike this evening is already old news before it\u2019s happened, with investors pricing it in as a certainty. Instead they will be turning their attention to the months ahead, with traders listening out for clues on whether or not the next hike will come in December. The pound is lower this morning as investors remain cautious about prospects for Brexit negotiations between the UK and the EU. It had recovered in recent sessions after the biggest one-day loss since 2016 on Friday, when Theresa May said talks were at an \u201cimpasse\u201d. The pound is currently down 0.1% against the dollar at $1.3163 and down 0.1% against the euro at \u20ac1.1187. Britain\u2019s high street banks approved 42,581 mortgages for house purchase in August, which was 4.3% fewer than the same month last year. It was also down on July, when 43,967 mortgages were approved according to the figures from the banking trade body, UK Finance. Remortgaging increased however, by 9.2% to 32,457, as home owners took advantage of a competitive market with some decent deals. Mark Harris, chief executive of mortgage broker SPF Private Clients, said lenders were competing for customers as potential home movers become more cautious ahead of Brexit: With many would-be buyers holding off making a decision until Brexit is resolved one way or another, lenders are battling for a relatively small pool of borrowers and are having to reduce rates accordingly. Barclays, HSBC, Halifax and TSB are among the big names to have reduced the cost of fixed-rate mortgages recently, and we expect this trend to continue as lenders try to boost business before the end of the year. In case you missed it... the governor of Argentina\u2019s central bank, Luis Caputo, resigned unexpectedly on Tuesday after just three months in the job. Caputo quit just as Argentina is negotiating emergency financial support from the IMF, initially sending the peso down 7%, before trimming some of the losses. Investor concern over economic prospects and debts in Argentina have sent the peso down more than 50% this year, and inflation is expected to top 40%. The central bank said in a statement: This resignation is due to personal reasons, with the conviction that a new agreement with the International Monetary Fund will reestablish confidence in the fiscal, financial, monetary and exchange rate situation. However, Paul Greer at Fidelity was not convinced: The timing could not be worse for Argentina. Caputo\u2019s resignation will only add to investor uncertainty. The FTSE 250 index, which tends to include firms that are more focused on the domestic market in the UK than those in the FTSE 100, is also down this morning, by 0.2% at 20,422. It\u2019s biggest faller is the AA, with shares down 8.4% at 109p after it blamed a plunge in first-half profits on Britain\u2019s \u201cpothole epidemic\u201d. Major markets across Europe are down this morning, after Wall Street closed lower on Tuesday. Investors will be cautious ahead of the Fed decision and more importantly its signals for future policy decisions, but markets are also subdued after President Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d message at the UN. The latest scores: FTSE 100: -0.1% at 7,500 Germany\u2019s DAX: -0.1% at 12,365 France\u2019s CAC: -0.1% at 5,474 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: -0.4% at 21,586 Spain\u2019s IBEX: -0.02% at 9,492 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: -0.1% at 383 The AA has said this morning that the \u201cbeast from the east\u201d earlier in the year triggered a \u201cpothole epidemic\u201d in the UK, and contributing to the highest number of vehicle breakdown call outs in 15 years. The breakdown recovery service said the trend drove pre-tax profits down 65% in the six months to 31 July, to \u00a328m. Simon Breakwell, AA chief executive, said: The first half of the financial year has seen exceptional weather conditions, from extreme cold and snow in February and March to the hottest summer in recent memory, with the severe winter also creating a pothole \u201cepidemic\u201d on the UK\u2019s roads. All this led to a 15-year high in the number of breakdowns we serviced. Against this backdrop, I am extremely proud of our achievements and to be reporting results in line with our guidance as we continue to build resilience throughout the business. Full story here: A rate hike from the Federal Reserve today would be the eighth one since December 2015, Michael Hewson from CMC Markets notes. The only G7 central bank that has come anywhere close to this level of tightening of monetary policy has been Canada which has seen four rate rises over the same period. Despite these rate rises, US and Canadian markets have managed to remain close to recent record highs, despite concerns over a break down in the NAFTA trade deal and the start of a fresh round of tariffs this week in the current trade stand-off between the US and China. If the FOMC is particularly aggressive in terms of its rate outlook, and in terms of its assessment of the health of the US economy, then we could well see further US dollar strength in emerging market currencies. If on the other hand they are more cautious and signal it may be time for a pause then the US dollar could come under additional pressure, given recent weakness. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u2019s Fed decision day, and investors are pricing in the third US rate hike of the year, as the central bank\u2019s chairman Jerome Powell and his colleagues continue to displease President Trump who has said he is not happy with the rate rises. The decision will be announced at 7pm UK time, and anything other than a rate hike will come as a major shock to markets. The dollar index, which measures the US currency against a basket of other major currencies, is edging higher ahead of the decision. What investors really want to know is, what does the Fed have planned next? Jasper Lawler, from London Capital Group, explains: The Fed are widely expected to hike 25 basis points to 2.25%, in the 3rd hike of the year. Whilst this hike is almost completely priced in and another in December over 76% priced in, investors will be turning their attention to next year. In June, the Fed indicated 3 hikes across 2019 and these are expected to be carried out one per quarter, for the first three quarters. This leaves traders wondering what the Fed have planned thereafter? A hawkish plan could re-ignite the dollar rally, whilst suggestions of a slow down in the pace of hiking or that the Fed is coming to the end of its cycle next year, could bring the dollar tumbling lower.

There is a roughly 95% chance of the fed funds rate moving up to the 2-2.25% target, which means the decision itself is well baked in to market pricing. This would be the third interest rate rise this year and indicators still point firmly towards a fourth by December.<br></p> <p>Therefore, market attention is on a number of other elements contained in both the projections (dots) and the monetary policy statement.</p> <p>The key question is what monetary policy in 2019 looks like. Currently the median dot plots point to three hikes in 2019 but there are a number of factors that might tempt the Fed to slow its pace next year. The fiscal put should start to lessen, while tariffs could impact on its forecasts for growth. However a lot depends on the extent to which the Fed sees tariffs pushing up prices as well.</p> <p> Similarly, quite why the Fed would slow up its pace of tightening from its June projections seems unclear. The question really is what has changed in the intervening months to make it beat a more dovish drum. The answer is, with the exception of further concerns about trade, precious little. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5bab8a05e4b072dfb217d1c0\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-09-26T13:34:07.177Z\">2.34pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Wall Street opens (slightly) higher</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>US markets edged higher on the opening bell:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Dow Jones: +0.1% at 26,521</strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>S&amp;P 500: +0.1% at 2,918</strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Nasdaq: +0.1% at 8,017</strong></li> </ul> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5bab8497e4b0a71b5946cffc\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-09-26T13:19:48.830Z\">2.19pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">CBI: Labour lacks business experience and workable policies</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Carolyn Fairbairn, CBI director-general, says that Labour is thinking up policies that work on paper but not in reality because the party lacks business experience.</strong><br></p> <p>Responding to Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s closing speech at the Labour Party Conference, Fairburn said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Much of Labour\u2019s vision for a more sustainable and fair country is absolutely right.

      "bodyText": "Lack of business experience in the Labour party too often \u201cfuels ideas that are appealing on paper or conference platforms but unworkable in reality\u201d, said Carolyn Fairbairn, director-general of the CBI, after hearing Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s conference speech in Liverpool. She has a point, of course. Exhibit A this week would be the plan to make large companies give 10% of their shares to workers, as unveiled by the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell. The flaws are obvious. If you are going to cap employees\u2019 dividends on those shares at only \u00a3500 a year and allow the Treasury to bag the rest of the proceeds, the big idea is a really a big tax-raising measure, as financial projections demonstrate. UK pension funds would be also be heavy losers if their investments were diluted by a tenth. And companies might just try to flatten wages. So, yes, more business experience might have produced a better designed plan, especially as most large quoted companies run employee share schemes already, as Fairbairn noted. But Fairbairn and the CBI, before they accuse Labour of having a tin ear, should examine their own record and consider why trust in business has fallen so sharply. Where is the aggressive business-led campaign to shame corporate tax avoiders into paying their fair share? Where is the outrage over boardroom pay excesses? It is possible to hear CBI folk give virtuous speeches on these subjects \u2013 but usually only in vague terms. \u201cWe\u2019ve got much more to do on trust, on transparency and on gender pay,\u201d the then president Paul Drechsler said in May. But then you get absurdly defensive statements from the CBI such as the one that followed the damning report by two cross-party committees into the collapse of Carillion. \u201cThe language of the report suggests committee members think business in general is greedy and reckless,\u201d opined the CBI, which was a complete mis-reading of what was said. MPs had stated: \u201cMost companies are not run with Carillion\u2019s reckless short-termism.\u201d The CBI has subsequently tried to sound angry about Carillion but, really, if the first reaction on reading a 100-page evidence-based report into a collapse of a major outsourcer is to see an attack on business in its entirety, one wonders whether minds are truly open. Or try a subject that Corbyn didn\u2019t mention yesterday but could have done \u2013 the big auditors. A debate currently rages about whether the Big Four auditors should be broken up to address conflicts of interests, declining standards and scandals that extend further back than Carillion. What\u2019s the CBI\u2019s take? The audit profession \u201cmust continue to evolve\u201d, it says, which is meaningless. You do not have to be a cynic to suspect the CBI\u2019s reticence may be connected to the fact that all four big auditors are among its leading members. As with Labour, we\u2019d be surprised if the CBI didn\u2019t look out for its members\u2019 interests. But there\u2019s a wider point here, and Jim O\u2019Neill, the former Goldman Sachs executive cited by Corbyn, made it well when he referenced lack of awareness, or indifference, in boardrooms. \u201cChief executives need to realise that rising profits are, at some point, supposed to make markets more competitive and [deliver] greater benefits for employees,\u201d he wrote in the FT. That\u2019s a fair analysis. There is more lip service to inclusive capitalism than actual delivery. Big business, if it really wants to build on \u201ccommon ground\u201d with Labour, as Fairbairn suggests, could also usefully remove a few blinkers itself. Outsiders\u2019 frustration has not arisen out of thin air. Surrender is the right choice for Murdoch Sky was possibly Rupert Murdoch\u2019s most daring business investment and it\u2019s the asset, he once said, he\u2019d be saddest to see go. But the sale of the 39% stake to Comcast will happen. In practice, Disney, which is set to inherit 21st Century Fox\u2019s holding in the UK broadcaster, was probably the prime mover in the decision to sell. But, whoever had the final say, surrender is the right cool-headed choice. First, Comcast is paying a pretty price for Sky, as the damage to its own share price suggests. The takeover price of \u00a317.28 a share is way beyond expectations, even after Comcast turned up as a rival bidder to Fox. Second, companies generally hate being minority investors. Continuing to hold the 39% would have irritated Comcast but the business rationale was thin. Third, Disney could use the \u00a312bn proceeds from flogging the shares. It is in the process of buying the bulk of Murdoch\u2019s US empire for $71bn and needs cash to keep debt under control and to invest. Common sense has prevailed, as always seemed likely.",

Big business, if it really wants to build on \u201ccommon ground\u201d with Labour, as Fairbairn suggests, could also usefully remove a few blinkers itself. Outsiders\u2019 frustration has not arisen out of thin air.</p> <h2>Surrender is the right choice for Murdoch</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c5a91829af1e1c2f28af6b27509761ca6273cd5a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c5a91829af1e1c2f28af6b27509761ca6273cd5a/45_114_3434_2061/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rupert Murdoch\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rupert Murdoch once said Sky was the asset he would be saddest to see go.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Segar/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sky was possibly Rupert Murdoch\u2019s most daring business investment and it\u2019s the asset, he once said, he\u2019d be saddest to see go. But the sale of the 39% stake to Comcast <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/sep/26/rupert-murdochs-sky-reign-to-end-as-fox-sells-all-shares-to-comcast\">will happen</a>. In practice, Disney, which is set to inherit 21st Century Fox\u2019s holding in the UK broadcaster, was probably the prime mover in the decision to sell. But, whoever had the final say, surrender is the right cool-headed choice.</p> <p>First, Comcast is paying a pretty price for Sky, as the damage to its own share price suggests. The takeover price of \u00a317.28 a share is way beyond expectations, even after Comcast turned up as a rival bidder to Fox. Second, companies generally hate being minority investors. Continuing to hold the 39% would have irritated Comcast but the business rationale was thin.</p> <p>Third, Disney could use the \u00a312bn proceeds from flogging the shares. It is in the process of buying the bulk of Murdoch\u2019s US empire for $71bn and needs cash to keep debt under control and to invest. Common sense has prevailed, as always seemed likely.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Uber and courier firms including CitySprint are to be called to give evidence to a parliamentary inquiry into gig economy companies that have continued to deny workers employment rights despite tribunal rulings. Frank Field MP, chair of the work and pensions committee, is to see if changes to legislation and enforcement are needed to ensure workers have their legal employment rights. The new inquiry comes after a string of tribunal rulings against companies, including Uber, eCourier and CitySprint, which ruled that couriers and taxi drivers should be classified as workers and be entitled to holiday pay and the minimum wage. The companies failed to deliver those rights across their workforce, and argued that their drivers and riders were self-employed contractors. \u201cThe inquiry will, I hope, shine a bright light on the extent to which justice is being evaded in the gig economy,\u201d said Field, who resigned the Labour whip late August. \u201cWe will be looking to suggest any immediate changes that are required, both to the law itself as well as its enforcement, to ensure no company is able to evade justice.\u201d The inquiry launches as Uber continues to fight a 2016 tribunal ruling that said its drivers were workers and not self employed. The latest round is expected to be heard at the court of appeal late in October. Since the tribunal ruling Uber has offered some improved conditions for UK drivers, including limited insurance, limits on working hours and a 24-hour phone line for support. Uber has repeatedly insisted that most of its drivers wanted to retain the flexibility to choose their own hours. However, the firm continues to face criticism over conditions. Couriers working for its Uber Eats takeaway delivery service this week protested outside the company\u2019s London head office over a change in pay structure, which they said left them out of pocket. In November 2017 CitySprint was accused of making a mockery of Britain\u2019s employment rights system after changing couriers\u2019 contracts rather than giving them the minimum wage and holiday pay, despite losing an employment tribunal case on the issue. In May 2017, eCourier, a subsidiary of Royal Mail specialising in same-day deliveries, admitted it had incorrectly classified a London-based bicycle courier as an independent contractor and had wrongly denied him standard employment benefits. The company immediately announced a review into how it could implement the same worker status \u201cfor colleagues where it reflects their actual working arrangements with us\u201d. Ian Oliver, chief executive of eCourier, said: \u201cWe did carry out a review of our fleet of drivers and identified a group who we felt could be \u2018workers\u2019. Accordingly we changed their contracts to provide benefits such as holiday pay. They were also offered a workplace pension.\u201d But the Independent Workers\u2019 Union of Great Britain said it was frustrated that there had been no sign of significant change. Jason Moyer-Lee, general secretary of the union, which has been involved in a number of tribunal actions on workers\u2019 status, said: \u201cFor a couple of years now we have been winning tribunal claims against courier and private hire companies. Yet despite this somehow these workers are still not getting the rights they\u2019re entitled to. The enforcement system is clearly broken and this inquiry will shine a welcome spotlight on its abject failure.\u201d Field will be gathering evidence from individual workers, legal experts, enforcement specialists, trade unions and companies, with a view to publishing his findings alongside a series of recommendations before Christmas. The government\u2019s director of labour market enforcement, Sir David Metcalf, will also be invited to contribute to the inquiry.",

After a two-day meeting the Fed announced a quarter percentage point rise in its benchmark rate to a range of 2% to 2.25%. The rate is used to set credit card, mortgage and loan rates and will trigger rises across the board for consumers. The increase is the third rate rise this year and comes as US unemployment has hit new lows. In August the US added 201,000 new jobs \u2013 a record-breaking 95th consecutive month of jobs growth \u2013 as the unemployment rate remained steady at 3.9%. The rise pushed the Fed\u2019s rate above 2% for the first time since 2008, when the central bank stepped in and cut rates to close to zero as it sought to tackle the recession triggered by the last financial crisis. In a statement the Fed signaled more rate hikes were imminent. \u201cThe committee expects that further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate will be consistent with sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee\u2019s symmetric 2% objective over the medium term. Risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced,\u201d the statement read. The rate hike came despite Donald Trump\u2019s explicit \u2013 and unprecedented \u2013 criticism of the Fed\u2019s decision to increase interest rates. \u201cI\u2019m not thrilled with his raising of interest rates, no.

    "webTitle": "Keeping the facts hidden will do nothing to improve the gender pay gap | Greg Jericho", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The latest compilation of gender indicators by the Australian Bureau of Statistics is a report card that reads: improvement made but there is still a long way to go. The indicators come as the Labor party has announced a policy for companies with more than 1,000 employees to publicly reveal how much they pay women compared with men \u2013 a policy, which the prime minister, Scott Morrison, has suggested might lead to \u201cconflict in the workplace\u201d. As I noted last week when the ALP announced its superannuation policy, women\u2019s lifetime incomes are significantly much lower on average than men\u2019s, and the main reason is that women are the ones who leave the workforce to raise children. The gender indicators released by the ABS provide further evidence of this with a breakdown of labour force data for parents of dependent children. Over the past decade the participation rate of men with a dependent child aged 0-5 has barely changed and remains around 94%. By contrast the participation rate of female parents has increased significantly since 2007-08. But the rise from 54% to 62% still sees them well behind that of men and also behind the 73% participation rate for all women aged 15-64: While the gap between men and women remains large, the data also reveals the big jump in participation for women once their children reach school age. While the participation rate for male parents is virtually the same regardless of the age of their children, for women, their children starting school makes a huge difference. In 2017, 62% of women with a child aged 0-5 were in the labour force but 80% of those with children in the school ages of 6-14 were in the labour force: This jump reflects an impact that having a child has on women that is not at all experienced by men. But it is wrong to assume it cannot be improved. The belief that women must always stop work once they have a child has undergone serious changes in the past few decades and has meant that the working life for women born in 1982, for example, is greatly different to those born 20 years earlier: Women born in 1962 experienced a massive drop in employment once they entered their mid-20s, and they did not return in large numbers to the workforce until their 40s. Women born in 1982, however, experience only a small drop in employment once they reach their 30s \u2013 an indication of women having children later in life and also being more likely to stay in work. But those women are most likely to be working part time in a manner that their male partners are not. Only about 8% of men with a child aged 0-5 work part-time compared to 17% of men aged 15-64, while 61% of women with such aged children do so, compared to 46% of all women aged 15-64: The higher rates of women leaving the workforce \u2013 and thus losing both income and promotional opportunities \u2013 coupled with the higher rates of women working part-time not surprisingly sees women across all industries earning less than men: While some industries have seen some closing of the gender pay gap, overall the ratio of women\u2019s weekly earnings to men has not really changed since 2006. In 2006, women\u2019s median earnings were 72% of men, this fell to 71% in 2008, rose to 73% in 2010, then down again to 72% in 2012. It fell further in 2014 to 69% before improving in 2016 to 71%. The pay gap exists as well across all occupational types, from managers through to labourers: And of course you can argue this is because women have chosen to work less, or that because they have stayed home to raise children, they will of course likely earn less. But when you consider that more women are now university graduates than men and yet the average starting salaries for women graduates in almost every field is lower than that of men, it is rather less able to be explained away as being due to choice: That, for example, the starting salaries of women law and paralegal graduates are on average 8% lower than male graduates suggests the issue of a gender pay gap starts rather a bit earlier than women in their 30s deciding to stay home to have children. And of course it all leads to women ending up with a lower level of superannuation \u2013 some 42% less than men \u2013 a figure that has not improved over the past decade: While this data is good for shining a light on the issue, the paucity of the data (some of the latest figures only go up to 2016) suggests the ALP\u2019s policy of companies needing to reveal their gender pay differential would provide not only more information but also an incentive for companies to promote women and seek to achieve equal employment. Certainly in the public sector this is being achieved. The data reveal that there is now a near parity of men and women at the executive level (generally manager of a section or branch), while 43% of senior executive service positions (secretaries of departments, deputy secretaries and the like) are women: This compares very favourably to the private sector where in 2016 just 30% of key management positions were held by women and a mere 17% of CEOs were women: In both categories this is an improvement on the past (although only marginally so for CEOs) but still sees them lagging well behind the public sector and highlights just how far they have to go. Morrison might be concerned about the truth causing conflict in the workplace, but keeping the facts hidden will do nothing to improve the gender pay gap and will only serve to entrench poor hiring and promotional practices. And as the gender indicators highlight, when it comes to pay, women certainly are used to getting the minimum. \u2022 Greg Jericho is a Guardian Australia columnist",

By contrast the participation rate of female parents has increased significantly since 2007-08. But the rise from 54% to 62% still sees them well behind that of men and also behind the 73% participation rate for all women aged 15-64:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Participation rate of parents with a child aged 0-5 years\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/35UDw/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>While the gap between men and women remains large, the data also reveals the big jump in participation for women once their children reach school age. While the participation rate for male parents is virtually the same regardless of the age of their children, for women, their children starting school makes a huge difference.</p> <p>In 2017, 62% of women with a child aged 0-5 were in the labour force but 80% of those with children in the school ages of 6-14 were in the labour force:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Participation rate of women by age of dependent child\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/KVyKS/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>This jump reflects an impact that having a child has on women that is not at all experienced by men.</p> <p>But it is wrong to assume it cannot be improved. The belief that women must always stop work once they have a child has undergone serious changes in the past few decades and has meant that the working life for women born in 1982, for example, is greatly different to those born 20 years earlier:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Average employment rates of women by year of birth and age\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/zegvt/5/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Women born in 1962 experienced a massive drop in employment once they entered their mid-20s, and they did not return in large numbers to the workforce until their 40s.

The New Nuclear Watch Institute warned against what it called the \u201cfolly of technological tribalism\u201d of pursuing a future powered by renewables and gas-fired power stations, rather than any new nuclear plants. Excluding nuclear would cause the UK to emit millions of extra tonnes of carbon dioxide and put the country\u2019s carbon targets out of reach, the group concluded in a report due to be published on Thursday. Tim Yeo, the institute\u2019s chairman, said: \u201cAbandoning nuclear power leads unavoidably to a very big increase in carbon emissions, which will prevent Britain from meeting its legally-binding climate change commitments. It also raises the cost of electricity.\u201d The claims will be seen as a direct riposte to recent suggestions from the government\u2019s infrastructure advisers, who urged ministers to cool their ambitions for as many as six new nuclear projects and prioritise renewables instead. The National Infrastructure Commission suggested the UK back only one more nuclear plant after the two reactors being built at Hinkley Point in Somerset. However, the New Nuclear Watch Institute, which is supported by nuclear industry firms including the South Korean company eyeing a nuclear project in Cumbria, said \u201ctechnological zealots\u201d were trying to restrict the range of options for cleaning up electricity generation.

The \u201cno nuclear\u201d world would lead to the cost of managing the UK\u2019s energy system being 15% higher and result in an extra 35m tonnes of CO2, around a tenth of today\u2019s annual emissions. However, the comparison is based on an extreme scenario \u2013 few expect Hinkley Point C will be axed, given the billions EDF Energy has already poured into it.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The government has appointed a minister to oversee the protection of food supplies through the Brexit process amid rising concerns about the effect of a no-deal departure from the European Union. The MP David Rutley, a former Asda and PepsiCo executive, was handed the brief at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs earlier this month. Defra said that Rutley, who once ran home shopping and e-commerce businesses at Asda, was merely taking on responsibilities already held by other ministers. He said: \u201cIt is an honour to join the Defra ministerial team at such an important time. I am determined to ensure that we fully realise the opportunities of leaving the EU.\u201d Food industry insiders welcomed his appointment after warnings that delays of only half an hour at UK ports and the Irish border would risk one in 10 British firms going bankrupt. One food industry business leader said: \u201cThe issue at the ports is a big threat. The UK always has been a net importer of food. If the ports don\u2019t work then exporters will be struggling and importers will have a challenge too.\u201d The executive said that while some food manufacturers were already setting aside additional supplies, stockpiling was not possible for products with a short shelf life, such as milk or vegetables. Another industry insider said the appointment of Rutley was \u201ctotally welcome\u201d. They added: \u201cThere has been a level of naivety that people can stockpile food which is completely impossible and shows a misunderstanding of how the supply chain works. We would welcome someone genuinely informed and engaged.\u201d Fears have risen amid the increasing likelihood of Britain crashing out of the EU without a deal in little more than six months time, after Theresa May failed to win support for her Brexit plan from European leaders and said both sides had reached an impasse. Ministers have attempted to downplay concerns by suggesting they could relax efforts to collect border taxes to maintain the free movement of imports and exports in the event of no deal. However, food retailers have said such plans could still lead to a logjam on the UK side of the border as trucks get stuck trying to head back into the EU to pick up their next load. Several major UK firms have warned of the risks from tougher border controls, including the retail chain Next. The short shelf life of food products, which could be rendered inedible by just a few hours\u2019 delay, makes them particularly vulnerable.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The AA has blamed a \u201cpothole epidemic\u201d caused by the \u201cbeast from the east\u201d and low road maintenance spending for a drop in half-year profits, after it was forced to deal with the highest number of vehicle breakdown callouts in 15 years. The roadside vehicle recovery firm said core earnings fell 17% to \u00a3161m in the six months to the end of July, owing to the increased expenditure and higher costs needed to use third-party garages to house the much higher number of vehicles that had broken down. The number of breakdowns rose by 8% to 1.91m in the six-month period. This contributed to a 65% decline in pre-tax profit, from \u00a380m to \u00a328m. Investors were spooked, with AA shares down about 12% at 105p by lunchtime on Wednesday, the biggest fall on the FTSE 250. Simon Breakwell, the AA chief executive, said: \u201cWe\u2019ve had a 15-year high in breakdowns, we had the worst winter back to back with the hottest summer; all of which causes everyone to drive their cars \u2013 and more cars on the road generally means more breakdowns. \u201cSometimes you have a rubbish winter and sometimes you have a really hot summer but it\u2019s rare that you have a rubbish winter back to back with the hottest summer.\u201d Chris Grayling, the transport secretary, said in May that the winter had been \u201cparticularly bad\u201d for local roads and that some had twice as many potholes as last year. Councils received an additional \u00a3100m to fix potholes since the winter but he told the Times: \u201cWe probably haven\u2019t spent enough on roads in this country since the 1980s.\u201d A survey published by the AA in May showed nearly nine out of 10 drivers said roads were worse compared with a decade ago while two-thirds said they had \u201cconsiderably deteriorated\u201d in that period. More than half of motorists in Scotland said residential streets were poor and a third of main roads in the east Midlands were considered to be in a bad condition. One in 10 drivers in the north-east said their motorways were riddled with potholes, although motorways were generally rated the roads in the best overall condition, while local roads were the worst affected, with less spending per mile. Despite the \u201cpothole epidemic\u201d, the AA stuck to its full-year forecast of \u00a3335m and \u00a3345m for core earnings, before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation. According to the Annual Local Authority Road Maintenance (Alarm) survey 2018, \u00a39.3bn needed to be spent to bring roads back into reasonable condition in England and Wales. Councils were fixing a pothole every 21 seconds but it would still take more than a decade to clear the repair backlog on local roads, according to the Local Government Association. After decades of underspending, the government\u2019s austerity programme following the financial crisis made things worse. Councils have had their real spending power \u2013 government funding plus council tax \u2013 reduced by 29% between the financial years 2010-11 and 2017-18. Local authorities have reported an increase in average highway maintenance budgets to \u00a320.6m this year from \u00a317.1m in 2017, although budgets have barely kept in line with inflation over the past decade, according to the Alarm survey. This year\u2019s figures also hid a wide disparity, with some councils spending \u00a3100m and others less than \u00a31m. Between the financial years 2010-11 and 2016-17, spending on local roads declined by 13%, whereas spending on motorways and major A roads maintained by Highways England went up by 5.5%, according to the Department for Transport. The AA was formed by a group of motoring enthusiasts in 1905 and provides roadside help as well as motor insurance policies. It has been investing heavily in its roadside business to increase the number of company-owned patrols and improve its mobile-app-based services for car breakdowns under Breakwell, who took over the top job last year.",

In the face of increasing pressure to reduce overcharging, Ofcom has called on the big mobile phone operators to be fairer and more transparent with customers who bought their handset on a fixed-term contract that has ended. Consumers opting for a new, high-end handset typically agree to pay \u00a337 or more for two years. The deal includes the mobile phone\u2019s purchase and a monthly calls, text and data package. However, the operator will usually continue to charge the same amount each month, long after the contract has finished. Sim-only deals that offer the same amount of calls and data can cost less than \u00a310 per month but consumers have to ask to be moved on to the cheaper tariff. Last week, Citizens Advice warned that up to 4m mobile users were being overcharged for phones they already own. It said the overpayment could amount to as much as \u00a3490m a year. Prompted into action, Ofcom has said it will consult on how consumers should be better protected. It has already required mobile operators to advise customers that their contract has finished \u2013 telling them to shop around \u2013 but is concerned too few users act on this.

Gillian Guy, the chief executive of Citizens Advice, said this was the obvious solution. \u201cThis move has the potential to make a real difference to consumers.

      "bodyText": "Taxpayers are on course to pay more than \u00a3150m following the collapse this year of Carillion after it was revealed the bill for redundancy payments is expected to hit \u00a365m. A freedom of information request by the Unite union showed an arm of the Insolvency Service has already made \u00a350m of redundancy payments to former Carillion workers and expects to hand over a further \u00a315m. The cost of lawyers and accountants handling the liquidation of the construction and services companies is expected to be more than \u00a370m and other costs are expected to escalate above \u00a320m, taking the total beyond \u00a3150m. Earlier this year the National Audit Office said the cost would hit \u00a3148m, prompting condemnation from opposition MPs who accused the government of mishandling the company\u2019s collapse and leaving taxpayers to foot the bill. Considered one of the most spectacular corporate collapses of modern times, Carillion filed for bankruptcy in January after its stock market value slumped 90% on the news it had racked up debts of about \u00a31bn and was struggling to fill a \u00a3600m hole in its pension fund. At the time, the Wolverhampton-based company had more than 19,000 employees, many of them working on Whitehall-commissioned contracts to build roads, schools and hospitals. Ministers were accused of realising too late that the company was in financial difficulties and then making matters worse by offering fresh contracts in an attempt to boost investor confidence. Several contracts were taken over by rivals after the collapse, but the \u00a3335m Royal Liverpool hospital will be finished with government money, the hospital\u2019s chief executive said on Tuesday, while the \u00a3550m Aberdeen bypass will be completed by the joint venture partners Balfour Beatty and Galliford Try. Labour\u2019s shadow cabinet spokesman, Jon Trickett, said he had received pledges from ministers in response to questions in the Commons that the costs associated with Carillion\u2019s downfall would be met by shareholders. \u201cWe were assured that shareholders, who have taken hundreds of millions out of the company over the years, would bear the burden, not the taxpayer,\u201d he said. \u201cNow it feels like the taxpayer has been skinned twice. First by contracts ministers signed with Carillion that were a bad deal and then by picking up the tab for the company\u2019s failure.\u201d The Redundancy Payments Office said: \u201cThe total amount we may pay out is approximately \u00a365m, of which \u00a350m has been paid so far based on actual claims received.\u201d Unite said ministers were to blame for allowing Carillion to file for compulsory liquidation with only \u00a329m in the bank, rather than enter a managed form of administration. It said the decision meant thousands of staff that transferred to other employers could not claim continued employment and fell outside the transfer of undertakings (protection of employment) regulations (Tupe) that protect a worker\u2019s pay, terms and conditions. \u201cThe lack of continuation of service means that the affected workers are considered new starters and have also lost many of their employment rights for a two-year period,\u201d Unite said. \u201cThe taxpayer will also have to pick up the bill for the work to complete several of Carillion\u2019s key strategic projects including the Royal Liverpool hospital and the Midland Metropolitan hospital in Sandwell, West Midlands. The cost of concluding these projects is expected to be in excess of \u00a3100m.\u201d Speaking at Labour\u2019s annual conference in Liverpool, Unite\u2019s assistant general secretary, Gail Cartmail, said: \u201cWhile the directors and senior executives of Carillion have largely slithered off into lucrative new roles, it is the taxpayers who have been left to pick up the pieces from their mess. \u201cThese revelations further underline why the government must order a full public inquiry into Carillion\u2019s collapse to not only understand who was responsible for the greatest corporate failure in UK history, but also the total cost to the taxpayer.\u201d A Cabinet Office spokesperson said: \u201cSince Carillion\u2019s insolvency, our approach has ensured the smooth continuation of public services and safeguarded over 13,000 jobs. \u201cThis government is committed to getting the new Royal Liverpool hospital built as quickly as possible for the benefit of patients across Merseyside and we expect to have an update on the next steps shortly.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Unilever\u2019s board is clearly rattled. You could hear its finance director, Graeme Pitkethly, on the Today programme defending the corporate plan to head to the Netherlands, and you could read the chairman Marijn Dekkers\u2019 opinion piece in the Telegraph. These public pleas wouldn\u2019t be necessary if the lobbying campaign \u2013 more than 200 meetings with investors over the past six months, says Dekkers \u2013 had guaranteed the \u201chuge support\u201d the company claims before next month\u2019s vote. In fact, it\u2019s effectively two votes in the UK, and it\u2019s hard to know which is more frightening for the board. On the conventional tally, Unilever needs a 75% majority among the plc shares. That already looks tight since Aviva and M&amp;G are committed to vote against and Lindsell Train will be voting at least some of its shares the same way. Legal &amp; General, the tracker fund supremo in the UK, will have to come up with a very good explanation if it doesn\u2019t join the rebellion. Tracker funds are among those most affected by the plan since a Dutch-incorporated Unilever would drop out of the FTSE 100 and other UK indices. In the second tally, though, Unilever needs a simple majority among shareholders who vote. In other words, individual votes count equally regardless of whether the holder has one share or 1m. There are reckoned to be 36,000 UK retail investors and 8,500 UK institutions, so a patriotic rebellion in the former camp could win the day on its own. That explains the belated media blitz by the directors. But Dekker is going to have to do better. From a technical perspective it should be as easy for Unilever to \u201csimplify\u201d into a single entity in the UK as in the Netherlands. So, if two out of three of Unilever\u2019s divisions will be based in the UK, a fact the chairman offered to pacify the UK audience, why put the head office elsewhere? Dekker brushed over the point as if the answer is somehow obvious. It\u2019s not. Next moves to soften the Brexit blow Next boss Lord Wolfson, it could be said, has more reason than most chief executives to offer investors an explanation of how a no-deal Brexit would affect the business. He was, after all, a prominent Vote Leave campaigner. In fact, Next\u2019s 10-page \u201cimpact analysis\u201d is exactly the type of document all large quoted companies should be producing if they\u2019re serious about keeping investors informed. It was free of political point-scoring and contained genuinely useful information, such as the maximum potential additional duties to be paid by Next: \u00a320m. Any wider lesson relates to Next\u2019s biggest fear: snarl-ups at UK ports. That\u2019s not because most of its imported goods, most of which come from outside the EU, would require much heavier customs checks. Rather, it\u2019s because other companies would have to make increased customs declarations. The worry is that the government is simply unprepared for a heavier workload. Wolfson makes three suggestions, all of which could be summarised as \u201cbe flexible\u201d. First, raise import thresholds for goods brought to the UK by small importers. Second, since business is trusted to collect \u00a3125bn in VAT every year, let it collect \u00a33.5bn in duty the same way, thereby relieving some of the pressure at ports. Third, extend \u201ctrusted trader\u201d status to more businesses so that checks on vehicles and documents could take place inland. In short, it\u2019s dull stuff that could prove very important next March. Being polite, Wolfson says it would be \u201chelpful to know\u201d if the government is considering such changes. In other words, get a move on. Fair point. It\u2019s alarming that Next seems better prepared than ministers. John McDonnell must rethink share ownership John McDonnell\u2019s \u201cinclusive ownership trust\u201d scheme would yield \u00a35.9bn for the Treasury in its 10th year, an FT analysis calculates. The numbers sound legit. The example was given here on Monday of Lloyds, where employees would have got \u00a334m in dividends last year but the Treasury would have collected \u00a3185m. Similar ratios would apply at other big dividend-payers with relatively few workers. McDonnell needs to rethink. His idea looks more like a tax-raising measure than a genuine attempt to increase employee share ownership. A chancellor can pursue both goals if he wishes \u2013 but the blurring of lines is underhand.",

These days, he has an easy distraction \u2013 navigating the international attention on his life. The father of three and former school groundskeeper has been learning to live with the gift and burden of being in the spotlight in the month since a California jury ruled that Monsanto caused his terminal cancer. The historic verdict against the agrochemical corporation, which included an award of $289m, has ignited widespread health concerns about the world\u2019s most popular weedkiller and prompted regulatory debates across the globe. Johnson, who never imagined he would be known as \u201cdying man\u201d in dozens of news headlines, is still processing the historic win. \u201cGoing against a company like this, becoming a public figure, it\u2019s intense,\u201d he told the Guardian in a rare interview since the 10 August verdict. \u201cI felt an enormous amount of responsibility.\u201d Johnson, who goes by the name Lee, was the first person to take Monsanto to trial on allegations that the global seed and chemical company spent decades hiding the cancer risks of its herbicide. He is also the first to win. The groundbreaking verdict further stated that Monsanto \u201cacted with malice\u201d and knew or should have known that its chemicals were \u201cdangerous\u201d. The legacy of the extraordinary ruling could be felt for generations, and Johnson said he is working to make the victory as impactful as possible while he still has time. Monsanto, meanwhile, filed papers last week seeking to throw out the verdict \u2013 and prevent Johnson\u2019s family from receiving the money. \u2018Safe enough to drink\u2019 The chemical that changed Johnson\u2019s life is glyphosate, which Monsanto began marketing as Roundup in 1974. The corporation presented the herbicide as a technological breakthrough that could kill nearly every weed without posing dangers to humans or the environment. Roundup products are now registered in 130 countries and approved for use on more than 100 crops, and glyphosate can be found in food, water sources and agricultural workers\u2019 urine. Research over the years, however, has repeatedly raised concerns about potential harms linked to the herbicide, and in 2015, the World Health Organization\u2019s international agency for research on cancer classified glyphosate as \u201cprobably carcinogenic to humans\u201d. Johnson said he knew nothing of the risks in 2012 when he began working as a groundskeeper for a public school district in Benicia, a suburb 30 miles east of San Francisco. Johnson liked his job, located near his hometown of Vallejo, where he was born and raised and still lives with his wife, Araceli, and their two young sons. In one social media video he posted from work one day, he was energetic about his duties, telling his followers, \u201cTo have a job, I feel real good, man.\u201d He added that one of his animal traps had caught a mouse, saying, \u201cMickey got snatched!\u201d His main role at the district was working as an integrated pest manager, responsible for spraying Roundup and Ranger Pro (another Monsanto glyphosate herbicide) at a handful of schools and sports fields in the area. Some days, he would spray 150 gallons worth over several hours. Johnson said he wasn\u2019t concerned about health hazards, given that Monsanto\u2019s labels had no warning. In a training session, he was told it was \u201csafe enough to drink\u201d. He also followed the label instructions diligently, he testified, reading them every time he sprayed. He compared the process to the way he followed recipes when he worked at a restaurant. He wore protective gear while spraying to be extra cautious. But there were occasional leaks, and one time his skin accidentally became drenched. In 2014, after about two years of regular use, he started to experience rashes and other forms of skin irritation, and he knew something was wrong. \u201cI used to have flawless skin,\u201d he recalled. \u201cIt was very noticeable to me and to other people. This wasn\u2019t normal.\u201d Soon, he had marks on his face and frightening lesions throughout his body, and doctors struggled at first to understand what was happening to him. Eventually, he learned the truth: it was cancer, and it was killing him. When they received the news, Araceli broke down weeping while he remained stoic, he recalled. \u201cI\u2019m not the type of person that\u2019s scared to die,\u201d he said. He wanted to figure out why he was sick \u2013 and what he could do to fight it. \u2018I felt totally betrayed\u2019 Johnson and Araceli met in a pre-algebra class in community college about 14 years ago. She was immediately drawn to him, but too scared to talk to him. Her sister, who was in the same class, eventually approached Johnson for her. At the highly watched trial in San Francisco this summer, the husband and wife both testified lovingly of their marriage. But they also described how cancer changed everything. Johnson said he used to do most of the household chores, including cooking and cleaning, but couldn\u2019t keep up once he got sick. Johnson was so ill at one point he could barely get out of bed for a month. He said he had missed a lot due to cancer, including the funeral of his uncle and various activities with his sons, who are now aged 10 and 13. Johnson has non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), a blood cancer that affects the immune system and caused his skin lesions. At times, the cancer has been so painful and debilitating, he couldn\u2019t walk or be outside in the sun. On some occasions, it hurt to have fabrics touching his skin, he testified. There have been periods where intimacy with his wife was simply not possible. In court, he expressed gratitude that she had stayed by his side through all of his suffering. Araceli had to start working two jobs at a local school district and nursing home, sometimes leading to 14-hour days, she testified. Sometimes, Johnson would cry at night when he thought she was asleep, she added. Their 10-year-old son, Kahli, wants to be a chemist, according to Johnson, and he once made a \u201cpotion\u201d to try and cure his father. It was a random assortment of kitchen ingredients in a small blue bottle. \u201cIt was salty, sweet, lemony,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIt was not good.\u201d At one point when his skin was getting worse, Johnson called a Monsanto hotline to discuss his illness. He spoke to a woman who sounded like she was reading from a script and told him someone would follow up with him. He never heard back and for a while continued spraying herbicide at work. But he started to do some of his own research: \u201cI wanted to know the facts.\u201d Eventually, he learned that there were studies linking glyphosate to cancer \u2013 a fact a supervisor at work later mentioned to him. \u201cI felt totally betrayed,\u201d he said. \u201cI lost everything. I was at rock bottom.\u201d Johnson eventually arrived at a place where he felt a lawsuit was his only hope \u2013 and the only way to uncover the truth. \u2018I\u2019m hoping that it snowballs\u2019 Regardless of the outcome, Johnson v Monsanto was always going to be a newsworthy trial, because the judge allowed the cancer patient\u2019s legal team to bring scientific arguments to the courtroom. The proceedings further shone a light on internal Monsanto emails over the years that Johnson\u2019s attorneys said showed how the company had repeatedly rejected critical research and expert warnings. Some evidence suggested that Monsanto had also strategized plans to \u201cghostwrite\u201d favorable research. Monsanto, which was bought by the pharmaceutical giant Bayer earlier this year, has continued to argue that Roundup does not cause cancer and that critics are \u201ccherrypicking\u201d studies while ignoring research that showed its products were safe. The jury disagreed. They ruled that Johnson also deserved $250m in punitive damages and $39.2m for losses. When the verdict was announced, Johnson said his body briefly went into a kind of shock. \u201cI felt like all the fluids went out of my body and rushed back in,\u201d he recalled. The jury\u2019s unanimous decision said Monsanto\u2019s products presented a \u201csubstantial danger\u201d to people and the company failed to warn consumers of the risks. \u201cThey have been hiding for years and getting away with it,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThey have to pay the price for not being honest and putting people\u2019s health at risk for the sake of making a profit.\u201d Before the verdict, Johnson said he had no expectations about the outcome. \u201cI never really discussed winning or money or amounts with the legal guys,\u201d he said, adding that he did fear the implications of a Monsanto win: \u201cIf we lose, the facts won\u2019t keep coming out. That would be the worst part.\u201d Pedram Esfandiary, one of Johnson\u2019s lawyers, said he was consistently impressed with Johnson\u2019s ability to remain optimistic and focused on exposing the facts and protecting others from Roundup hazards. \u201cThis guy is dealing with the reality of his mortality,\u201d he said. \u201cHis life is on the line because of what happened \u2026 He was concerned about getting the truth out.\u201d Johnson said he wanted to use the platform he has been given to continue raising awareness about glyphosate. He is now advocating to get the product off every school campus and playground in California. The Benicia school district, his former employer, already said it would stop using glyphosate. He considers that a start. The case could encourage consumers to change their habits and explore alternative ways to manage weeds, he said: \u201cI\u2019m hoping that it snowballs and people really get the picture and they start to make decisions about what they eat, what they spray in their farms.\u201d Johnson is currently undergoing regular chemotherapy and said he is feeling better than he has in a long time. Doctors have said he could have at most two years left to live. He is also focused on his music and has plans to release an EP of rap songs, including one titled Not My Time about his cancer struggle and pushing forward despite the \u201cearly death sentence\u201d. For Johnson, the case was never about \u201ccrumbling a company or taking down an empire\u201d. \u201cI hope [Monsanto] gets the message that people in America and across the world are not ignorant,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have already done their own research.\u201d He would now like to see Monsanto add cancer warning labels so that people can make informed decisions. He also hopes the legal process does not drag on for years, but expects Monsanto to continue aggressively fighting until the end. \u201cThat\u2019s what big companies like that do.\u201d He had one other request for Monsanto, something he knows he will never receive. Johnson would like an apology.",

He considers that a start.</p> <p>The case could encourage consumers to change their habits and explore alternative ways to manage weeds, he said<strong>:</strong> \u201cI\u2019m hoping that it snowballs and people really get the picture and they start to make decisions about what they eat, what they spray in their farms.\u201d</p> <p>Johnson is currently undergoing regular chemotherapy and said he is feeling better than he has in a long time. Doctors have said he could have at most two years left to live.
