      "bodyText": "Fresh details on price rises and wage growth this week are expected to underline the rising pressures on UK household budgets as the pound\u2019s sharp fall since the Brexit vote continues to stoke inflation. The Bank of England has warned the economy\u2019s main engine of growth, consumer spending, will lose momentum this year as rising living costs eat into people\u2019s budgets. Economists expect official figures on Tuesday will vindicate those worries, with inflation forecast to have reached its highest level for more than three years in March. The consumer prices index (CPI) measure of inflation is forecast to be 2.3% for the second month running, according to the consensus in a Reuters poll of economists. There was a broad range of views in the survey, with the lowest forecast at 1.9% and the highest at 2.5%. Labour market figures on Wednesday will offer new insights into whether looming Brexit negotiations have started to affect hiring decisions and will shed light on whether pay growth is keeping pace with inflation, or if incomes are in fact falling in real terms. Economists forecast average pay growth slipped to 2.2% in the three months to February, compared with a year earlier. \u201cWorrying for UK growth prospects, the fundamentals for consumers look odds-on to weaken markedly further over the coming months as rising inflation eats further into purchasing power with the squeeze reinforced by muted earnings growth,\u201d said Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at the consultancy IHS Markit. \u201cWe expect inflation to reach 3% before the end of 2017 and it could well rise further, to a peak around 3.3%, in the early months of 2018.\u201d The sharp fall in the pound since the referendum last summer has raised the price of imported goods such as fuels, metals and food ingredients. That has sparked some high-profile price tussles between suppliers and retailers, such as the row over Marmite last year. There have also been moves by food manufacturers to shrink their products while holding the price. Doritos, Peperami and Coco Pops were the latest products to be affected by \u201cshrinkflation\u201d. While economists agree that the underlying trend in inflation will be upwards this year, as higher oil prices add to pressure from the weak pound, some see a good chance the measure will fall back in March\u2019s figures. Economists at HSBC forecast inflation dipped to 2.2% year on year from 2.3% in February. \u201cIn March, inflation pressures should ease a touch, with oil and petrol prices having fallen over the month. Moreover, Easter fell in March in 2016 but is not until April in 2017, which will favour the comparison \u2013 although obviously this effect will go into reverse in April,\u201d they wrote in a preview note. Alan Clarke, an economist at Scotiabank, expects inflation to drop to 2.1%, thanks to the Easter impact on airfares being delayed until April this year, as well as softer fuel prices and a reversal of February\u2019s \u201clettuce crisis\u201d, when bad weather hit harvests in southern Europe and pushed the price of an iceberg up 67%. But economists at Investec predict inflation will nudge up to 2.4%, taking it further beyond the Bank\u2019s 2.0% target. \u201cWe anticipate further upward pressures from food, clothing and utilities \u2013 the latter reflecting the fact that two major utility companies raised prices, electricity prices in particular, on the month,\u201d said Investec\u2019s Chris Hare. A separate report from Lloyds added to evidence that companies were passing on some of their rising costs to customers. The bank\u2019s regular health check on businesses in England and Wales found activity rebounded in March, helped by improving order books. But hiring slowed and average prices charged for goods and services rose at the fastest pace for almost six years. The weaker pound also has benefits for UK businesses, because it makes their goods and services significantly cheaper in overseas markets. The forecaster EY Item Club predicted a revival in the UK\u2019s overseas markets will support the economy\u2019s readjustment away from consumer spending towards trade, and help smooth the impact of Brexit on economic growth. The group\u2019s spring forecast, released on Monday, notes consumer spending provided all the UK\u2019s growth last year, while overseas trade subtracted 0.4% from GDP. But the balance of economic activity in 2017 would be different. It expects the pound\u2019s drop, along with improving fortunes for the UK\u2019s big trading partners, to spur exports growth, with net trade forecast to add 0.2% to GDP this year and another 0.6% in 2018. The UK economy will grow 1.8% this year, matching last year\u2019s performance, but then growth will ease to 1.2% in 2018, the group predicted. Against that backdrop, the Bank of England is forecast to hold interest rates at their record low of 0.25% until the autumn of 2018. \u201cAlthough the starting gun for Brexit has just been fired, the UK economy has been adjusting to life outside the EU since the referendum,\u201d said Peter Spencer, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club.",

The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said diesel cars could play an important role in helping improve air quality in towns and cities and in tackling climate change. A government report published in April 2016 showed that diesel cars being sold in the UK emit an average of six times more nitrogen oxide in real-world driving than the legal limit used in official tests. Since then, a number of schemes have been mooted to encourage drivers to give up diesel vehicles, including the possibility of a government-run scrappage scheme. Last week, the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, announced a new charge on diesel cars driving into the city. Under the plans, drivers of diesel cars that are more than four years old in 2019 and petrol cars that are more than 13 years old will pay \u00a312.50 a day on top of the congestion charge in an attempt to cut air pollution. In a list entitled \u201c10 facts you need to know about diesel\u201d, the SMMT said that some recent reports had failed to differentiate between older diesel cars and those on sale today, which comply with Euro 6 emissions standards, adding: \u201cThis is unfair and dismissive of progress made.\u201d The organisation said the latest vehicles featured special filters and technology that converted most of the nitrogen oxide (NOx) from the engine into harmless nitrogen and water before it reached the exhaust. These cars will be exempt from the new London charges. It added: \u201cContrary to recent reports, diesel cars are not the main source of urban NOx. In London, gas heating of homes and offices is the biggest contributor, responsible for 16%. While road transport as a whole is responsible for around half of London\u2019s NOx, diesel cars produce just 11%, although concentrations will vary at different times depending on congestion.\u201d It said British car buyers registered almost 250,000 new diesel cars in March, more than in any month in history. Mike Hawes, the SMMT\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cEuro 6 diesel cars on sale today are the cleanest in history. Not only have they drastically reduced or banished particulates, sulphur and carbon monoxide but they also emit vastly lower NOx than their older counterparts \u2013 a fact recognised by London in their exemption from the Ultra Low Emission Zone that will come into force in 2019.\u201d He added: \u201cIn addition to their important contribution to improving air quality, diesel cars are also a key part of action to tackle climate change while allowing millions of people, particularly those who regularly travel long distances, to do so as affordably as possible.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A Senate crossbench majority is in favour of reforming the petroleum resource rent tax (PRRT) because taxpayers are not receiving a fair share of revenue for gas resources \u2013 a situation the Labor senator Sam Dastyari has called a \u201ccomplete fucking rort\u201d. One Nation, the Nick Xenophon Team and senators Jacqui Lambie and Derryn Hinch told Guardian Australia that they would be urging the government to change the system that had allowed multinational gas companies to avoid paying tax on some offshore Australian resources at a time when gas exports are booming. One Nation, Lambie and Hinch support a 10% flat tax to replace the PRRT to ensure adequate royalties are paid to the commonwealth. Xenophon would not discuss a specific figure but said Australians needed a fair return on resources and an increased supply of gas. On Sunday, the left-leaning McKell Institute, the Tax Justice Network and Dastyari launched a report that called on the Turnbull government to apply a flat rate resource royalty to all offshore gas projects \u2013 a move that would deliver taxpayers $28.4bn over 10 years. \u201cThere is no other way of framing what is going on at the moment with the offshore gas industry without saying the whole thing has become a complete fucking rort,\u201d Dastyari said. \u201cIt really is. The idea that you are paying more tax in a beer than they are paying on billion-dollar projects shows how ridiculous the system has become. You will get industry and government saying \u2018but nothing we are doing is illegal\u2019 but that is exactly the point. The fact that they can get away with this is the problem.\u201d A spokesman for One Nation said the party favoured an imposition of a royalty to ensure that, no matter how large resource companies structured their affairs, Australia would receive some tax revenue. \u201cWe favour imposition of a royalty so we get a drip of money all the time,\u201d the spokesman said. \u201cThose companies can then arrange their affairs any way they like but at least Australia is going to get something.\u201d The spokesman said One Nation senators would be discussing the issue but a royalty proposal would be taken to the government as the Coalition began discussions to gain the party\u2019s support in the Senate for budget measures. \u201cThe government has been very good at engaging with us, they are aware we don\u2019t horse trade and we think they would be mad to reject this,\u201d the spokesman said. \u201cEveryone wants the multinationals to pay their fair share of tax.\u201d Hinch said that while he was suspending final judgment until the government review reports later in the month, 10% would be fair and reasonable. \u201cI think a 10% tax/royalty would be fair and reasonable,\u201d Hinch said. \u201cReportedly, Exxon\u2019s paying no company tax at all. Neither is Chevron. I\u2019m told that Qatar is expected to raise about $26bn in revenue from royalties by 2021. \u201cCompare that to Australia. The forecast is that we\u2019ll raise less than $1bn under the current system \u2013 even though Australia may soon become the world\u2019s biggest gas exporter thanks to projects exploiting vast reserves off WA and in Queensland.\u201d In the last sitting week, Lambie argued against the government\u2019s company tax cuts on the grounds that Australia was \u201cgiving away\u201d its resources. She said multinational companies needed to pay more tax if the government wanted budget repair. \u201cAustralians are missing out on billions of dollars in royalties when Australia is experiencing a gas boom,\u201d Lambie told Guardian Australia. \u201cSince revealing how little gas companies pay in royalties to Australia in the Senate more than a week ago, the public response has been overwhelming. I will make sure the government looks at this as a matter of priority for the budget in May.\u201d Xenophon said he would not discuss a specific figure but warned the PRRT needed to be part of the solution to solve the gas crisis because businesses would not survive without an increase in domestic gas supplies. \u201cThe policy objective has to be fair return on the natural resources of Australia,\u201d Xenophon told Guardian Australia. \u201cSecondly, the prices paid for gas is increasing, which has seen domestic gas being double the price of Australian gas sold into Japan. The PRRT needs to be part of the solution.\u201d The treasurer, Scott Morrison, admitted last year that revenues from the PRRT had halved since 2012-13 and crude oil excise collections had fallen by more than half. At that time, he announced a formal review of the PRRT regime in November after a rapid decline in revenues from the tax. The government review, headed by the former executive director of treasury Mike Callaghan is due in April and recommendations were to be taken into the budget process. In November, Morrison said, \u201cIt is important these companies pay their fair share when it comes to these issues.\u201d But last week Morrison appeared to walk away from significant changes to the PRRT regime in the May budget, notwithstanding the government\u2019s own review. He rejected suggestions that Australia was missing out on tax revenue and warned that any changes needed to ensure investment projects were not effected. \u201cWhat I\u2019m saying is, if there are improvements that need to be made in this tax then you need to be very careful about how you do it because the last thing we want to see is go and scuttle a major investment project in this country by making changes to a tax arrangement which is critical to the yes-no decisions of those boards,\u201d Morrison said. \u201cThat would cost jobs.\u201d In spite of Dastyari\u2019s strong words, Labor has not committed to change the policy. It referred the issue to an inquiry by the Senate standing committee on economics before the government announcing its review but that committee will not report until September. Labor faced a fierce industry campaign against its mining tax under the Rudd and Gillard governments as did the former WA National party leader Brendon Grylls, who lost his seat in the recent state election. But the resource industry is split on the royalty debate. If Labor were to support change, there would be a majority in the Senate favouring PRRT reform, including the Greens and the majority of the crossbench. The McKell report found the PRRT was extremely generous towards major oil and gas companies, \u201cwho poorly compensate the Australian public for the publicly owned resources they are extracting from the ground and selling for profit\u201d. The report found PRRT tax revenue continues to decline. In 2014-15 the commonwealth received $1.8bn in PRRT and the report predicts this will decline to a predicted $880m by 2020. \u201cAt the same time, gas and oil companies in Australia are making significant profits, with the industry turning over $67bn in 2014-15,\u201d the report says. The report, written by professor of economics Richard Holden, of the University of New South Wales business school, and Marieke D\u2019Cruz, of the McKell Institute, found the PRRT had become increasingly inadequate in delivering economic benefits for Australians. At present, LNG projects located in commonwealth waters are not subject to any royalties. \u201cThe introduction of a royalty-based regime is both conceptually more appropriate and economically more beneficial to the commonwealth, and could deliver up to $11.361bn in revenue over the four-year forward estimates, or up to $28.4bn over 10 years,\u201d the McKell report says. \u201cSimply, the current system based solely around the PRRT, the system that applies to the majority of projects in commonwealth waters, results in significant portions of Australia\u2019s gas reserves being extracted with no compensation to the Australian owners of these resources. This is unacceptable.\u201d The report found the Australian tax regime was not in line with other countries, including Qatar, which has been the world\u2019s biggest exporter of LNG.",

The idea that you are paying more tax in a beer than they are paying on billion-dollar projects shows how ridiculous the system has become. You will get industry and government saying \u2018but nothing we are doing is illegal\u2019 but that is exactly the point. The fact that they can get away with this is the problem.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesman for One Nation said the party favoured an imposition of a royalty to ensure that, no matter how large resource companies structured their affairs, Australia would receive some tax revenue.</p> <p>\u201cWe favour imposition of a royalty so we get a drip of money all the time,\u201d the spokesman said. \u201cThose companies can then arrange their affairs any way they like but at least Australia is going to get something.\u201d</p> <p>The spokesman said One Nation senators would be discussing the issue but a royalty proposal would be taken to the government as the Coalition began discussions to gain the party\u2019s support in the Senate for budget measures.</p> <p>\u201cThe government has been very good at engaging with us, they are aware we don\u2019t horse trade and we think they would be mad to reject this,\u201d the spokesman said. \u201cEveryone wants the multinationals to pay their fair share of tax.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The whole thing has become a complete fucking rort.</p> <footer> <cite>Labor senator Sam Dastyari</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Hinch said that while he was suspending final judgment until the government review reports later in the month, 10% would be fair and reasonable.</p> <p>\u201cI think a 10% tax/royalty would be fair and reasonable,\u201d Hinch said. \u201cReportedly, Exxon\u2019s paying no company tax at all.

The forecast is that we\u2019ll raise less than $1bn under the current system \u2013 even though Australia may soon become the world\u2019s biggest gas exporter thanks to projects exploiting vast reserves off WA and in Queensland.\u201d</p> <p>In the last sitting week, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/mar/31/company-tax-cuts-deal-struck-with-xenophon-in-return-for-pension-boost\">Lambie argued against the government\u2019s company tax cuts</a> on the grounds that Australia was \u201cgiving away\u201d its resources.

I will make sure the government looks at this as a matter of priority for the budget in May.\u201d</p> <p>Xenophon said he would not discuss a specific figure but warned the PRRT needed to be part of the solution to solve the gas crisis because businesses would not survive without an increase in domestic gas supplies.</p> <p>\u201cThe policy objective has to be fair return on the natural resources of Australia,\u201d Xenophon told Guardian Australia. \u201cSecondly, the prices paid for gas is increasing, which has seen domestic gas being double the price of Australian gas sold into Japan.

The online lender said it was \u201curgently investigating illegal and unauthorised access\u201d to the personal data of some of its customers in the UK and Poland. It is understood that the breach could affect up to 270,000 current and former customers, including 245,000 in the UK. The company would not disclose where it had taken place. The lender, which offers loans at interest rates starting at 1,286% a year, became aware of a problem last week but did not realise until Friday that data could be accessed externally. It alerted the authorities and started to contact borrowers on Saturday to make them aware of the problem, and give details of a dedicated customer services phone line for those affected. Customers who are thought to have been affected have received a message from the payday lender telling them: \u201cWe believe there may have been illegal and unauthorised access to some of your personal data on your Wonga.com account.\u201d The message said that Wonga was working to establish the full details but data breached \u201cmay have included one or more of the following: name, email address, home address, phone number, the last four digits of your card number (but not the whole number) and/or your bank account number and sort code.\u201d It went on to say that the lender believed Wonga accounts and passwords had not been compromised, but customers were advised to look out for unusual activity across their accounts. In a statement the firm said: \u201cWe are working closely with authorities and we are in the process of informing affected customers. We sincerely apologise for the inconvenience caused.\u201d The breach will be a blow to Wonga, which has in recent years attempted to improve its reputation following a series of controversies. The lender, which advertised heavily on TV and through football sponsorships, was found by the financial regulator to have made loans to customers who could not afford to repay them and to have chased bad debts with letters from a fake law firm. New directors have replaced the firm\u2019s original founders, a three-month loan launched alongside the short-term payday loan, and marketing has been changed to appeal to a better-off audience. However, it has been hard hit by tougher rules on lending, introduced when the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) took on stewardship of the sector. The latest set of results showed that the firm made a pre-tax loss of \u00a380.2m in 2015, up from \u00a338.1m the year before. There was no sign of the breach on the lender\u2019s website, which carried its usual information on how to apply for its loans. It has alerted the police, the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office (ICO) and the FCA. The ICO regulates firms\u2019 use and care of people\u2019s personal details, although financial services companies are not obliged to inform it of any breach. A spokesperson for the organisatio said: \u201cAll organisations have a responsibility to keep customers\u2019 personal information secure. Where we find this has not happened, we can investigate and may take enforcement action.\u201d Wonga is the latest in a long line of companies to discover that information they hold on their customers has been compromised. In November, Tesco Bank suspended online transactions after \u00a32.5m was stolen from 9,000 customers, while mobile phone operator Three said information from 130,000 users had been compromised when its systems were breached. A cyber attack on phone company Talk Talk in 2015 resulted in a \u00a3400,000 fine from the ICO after it found the firm \u201ccould have been prevented if TalkTalk had taken basic steps to protect customers\u2019 information\u201d. On Twitter, some of Wonga\u2019s customers were expressing concern about the breach and complaining that they were struggling to get onto Wonga\u2019s website to change their account passwords.

      "bodyText": "Tesco will this week reassure investors that its crisis years are behind it by reporting a bigger than expected jump in annual profits. The chief executive, Dave Lewis, has alarmed some of the supermarket\u2019s biggest shareholders by mounting a surprise \u00a33.7bn takeover of Booker. But on Wednesday he will be able to provide some reassurance about the company\u2019s financial health, with underlying profits set to exceed the \u00a31.2bn figure pencilled in by City analysts. Macquarie analyst Sreedhar Mahamkali thinks Tesco is on track to bank \u00a31.3bn for the year to the end of February thanks to cost-cutting and a more benign pricing environment after two years of falling food prices came to an end. \u201cWe expect a beat and look for a confident outlook,\u201d said Mahamkali. Last year Tesco made an operating profit of \u00a3944m but five years ago that figure was \u00a34bn, which is why some investors are worried the purchase of Booker, the cash and carry company behind the Londis and Budgens convenience stores, will derail its recovery. Last month Schroders and Artisan Partners, which between them own 9% of Tesco, revealed they had both written to the Tesco chairman, John Allan, to ask him to pull out of the deal. Lewis took the helm at Tesco in 2014 after a string of profit warnings under his predecessor, Philip Clarke. But the subsequent discovery of accounting irregularities forced him to embark on a major restructuring of the business, including the disposal of its South Korean chain Homeplus for \u00a34bn. The shakeup culminated in a \u00a36.4bn loss two years ago after the group slashed the book value of its property and stock. Tesco is now close to drawing a line under the accounting scandal. Last month the company agreed to pay a fine of \u00a3129m to settle the Serious Fraud Office investigation. It also struck a \u00a385m deal with the Financial Conduct Authority to compensate affected shareholders. On Monday Tesco\u2019s lawyers will attend Southwark crown court to seek judicial approval for the deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) reached with the SFO. The proposed DPA relates to false accounting at its subsidiary Tesco Stores Limited between February and September 2014. Agreeing to pay a fine as part of a DPA is not an admission of wrongdoing but enables a company to avoid prosecution. While analysts believe profits from Tesco\u2019s overseas chains will miss expectations, that will be countered by a recovery in the UK, which is the retailer\u2019s biggest and most lucrative market. The retailer has won back disillusioned British shoppers by focusing on lower prices, improving customer service and making sure its shelves are full. It has also fought back against discounters Aldi and Lidl with the introduction of a budget range of own-label \u201cfarm\u201d brands. Satisfied that the UK\u2019s biggest supermarket chain is no longer in freefall, Lewis has set a target that by 2020 it will earn between 3.5p and 4p of operating profit for every \u00a31 customers spend. The group currently makes 2.2p in the \u00a31. To get there, Lewis is slashing \u00a31.5bn from the company\u2019s running costs by seeking to make its stores and distribution network more efficient. There was evidence of this programme last week when Tesco said 3,000 jobs were at risk as part of a shakeup that involves cutting night shifts for shelf stackers in some of its biggest supermarkets. On Wednesday investors will also be looking for an update on the retailer\u2019s pension fund after last autumn\u2019s admission the deficit had ballooned to \u00a35.9bn due to the collapse in bond yields after Britain voted to leave the EU. Bernstein analyst Bruno Monteyne estimates that favourable market movements have wiped at least \u00a31bn off that figure. But the scheme will undergo a triennial pension valuation this year that could lead to its trustees asking for more than the \u00a3270m a year they already receive to fund the scheme.",

      "bodyText": "Early investors in \u201cpunk\u201d beer firm BrewDog will be able to bank a hefty profit this week. An injection of cash from a private equity house valued the company at \u00a31bn, 10 years after it began life in its co-founder\u2019s mother\u2019s garage. San Francisco-based TSG Consumer Partners agreed to buy 22% of BrewDog, whose idiosyncratic beers and international network of bars have won it a cult following, in a deal worth \u00a3213m. Some \u00a3100m will be invested in the business while TSG, which also owns US brewer Pabst, also spent \u00a3113m buying shares from existing investors, according to the Sunday Times. Founders James Watt and Martin Dickie are understood to have made \u00a3100m between them as a result of the deal, a decade after they used a \u00a320,000 bank loan to start brewing in Fraserburgh, Aberdeenshire. BrewDog\u2019s army of nearly 50,000 \u201cEquity Punks\u201d, its name for investors in four previous rounds of crowdfunding, will be able to sell up to 15% of their shares from this week, the company said. Watt told investors that they stand make a return of 2,800% if they were among those who bought in at the first opportunity in 2010. That fundraising effort valued the company at just \u00a326m, but the brewer has grown rapidly since then by capitalising on the growing popularity of so-called \u201ccraft\u201d beers, tending towards strong hop flavours and higher alcohol content. It now employs 800 staff, is opening BrewDog bars across the world and has begun building a brewery in Columbus, Ohio, as a launchpad for a bid to conquer America. TSG\u2019s investment values the company, which posted a \u00a37m pre-tax profit on \u00a371m of revenues last year, at \u00a31bn. The valuation means that even late-stage investors who bought equity last year could make a 177% return if they choose to sell. Shareholders cleared the way for the investment by approving changes to BrewDog\u2019s capital structure at a meeting on 29 March, the company said, with 95% voting in favour. The changes include the award of preference shares to TSG, which confer the right to an annual return of 18% if the company is bought or lists on the stock market, according to reports. \u201cEver since we first started this journey in Martin\u2019s mum\u2019s garage, BrewDog has existed to make other people as passionate about great craft beer as we are,\u201d said Watt, adding: \u201cWe remain more laser focused on that goal than ever before. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to let the deal go to our heads, but Martin did buy himself a new jumper.\u201d The company also told its annual meeting that turnover rose 60% last year and predicted even better growth for 2017. BrewDog\u2019s decision to accept investment from a private equity group drew some comment in the light of its repeated efforts to cast itself in the role of a \u201cpunk\u201d upstart sceptical of major corporations. The brewer has also recently battled allegations of behaving just like the big businesses it claims to scorn, after the Guardian revealed that it threatened legal action against two small businesses it said were infringing its trademarks. Dozens of punk rock bands recently signed an open letter questioning the firm\u2019s right to use the term. Craft beer\u2019s top dogs: James Watt and Martin Dickie James Watt and Martin Dickie have said that they started brewing because \u201cbasically, we couldn\u2019t find anything we really wanted to drink\u201d. The pair, who were at school together in Aberdeenshire, started Brewdog in 2007 with the help of a bank loan, savings and a grant from the Prince\u2019s Trust. Ten years later they are a household name, thanks to tie-ups with major retailers and a series of headline-making controversies. It was Dickie who had the technical beer-making nous at the outset \u2013 he is a graduate of the International Centre for Brewing and Distilling at Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh and spent two years working at a brewery in Derbyshire called Thornbridge. Meanwhile, Watt studied law and economics at the same university before a stint as a fisherman. In their spare time they brewed and in 2006 they were advised to give up the day jobs by beer writer Michael Jackson. The next year, at the age of 24, they took on the lease of a building in Fraserburgh and invested in some equipment to launch their brand. Dickie has told how in the beginning all they did was work: \u201cSeven days a week and in the brewery \u2013 probably 18 to 20 hours a day. It was nothing but a lot of hard work and belief.\u201d After realising the power of publicity they responded to criticism of their stronger beers with the 1.1% ABV Nanny State, and produced another, The End of History, at a staggering 55% ABV, which was presented inside dead animals. In 2016 the Queen\u2019s birthday honours list included MBEs for the pair. Profiles by Hilary Osborne",

      "bodyText": "Ready to go house hunting? Tradition has it that no sooner have the hot cross buns been buttered on Good Friday than potential buyers start the search for a new home. Estate agents look forward to Easter the way retailers relish Christmas, but perhaps with less exuberance this year than is customary. As things stand, 2017 looks set to be the weakest year for housing transactions since 2013. The latest surveys from Nationwide and Halifax show house prices are no longer rising. In a sense, the lack of oomph in the property market is curious. Home ownership is still much sought after in Britain, where there is a strong feeling that bricks and mortar are a more reliable long-term investment than any other asset. What\u2019s more, it has never been cheaper to borrow. Even before the Bank of England cut interest rates to a record low of 0.25%, lenders were vying with each other to offer the most attractive home loan packages. Competition has driven down mortgage rates to ultra-low levels. Home ownership has fallen sharply, since peaking in the early 2000s, and is now at its lowest level in 30 years, yet there is no surge of prospective buyers seeking to take advantage of attractive deals. One explanation is that Brexit has made people wary about taking on financial commitments. Another is that rising inflation has made individuals feel worse off and is having a dampening effect on the housing market. Neither argument looks entirely convincing. Robust car sales suggest consumers are happy to buy big-ticket items, while the recent rise in the cost of living has been modest by historic standards. Inflation stands at just over 2%; within the past half decade, it has been above 5%. The likeliest explanation for the muted state of the property market is that houses are simply too expensive for first-time buyers, even with mortgage rates as low as they are. According to the Office for National Statistics, the average house price is 7.6 times the average annual salary, more than double the figure two decades ago. The Bank wants to prevent the sort of excessive lending that took place before the financial crisis of a decade ago and has told lenders not to offer loans that are more than 4.5 times a borrower\u2019s income. In those circumstances, only one of three things can happen. Earnings growth can pick up while house prices remain steady. Earnings growth can remain modest while house prices fall. Or prices remain high and income growth remains low, in which case stasis ensues. There seems little prospect of an acceleration in wage growth, currently running at little more than 2%. Equally, the conditions that would normally prompt a sharp fall in house prices \u2013 high and rising interest rates and increasing unemployment \u2013 are not present. The market will go sideways until such time as demand drops, the supply of homes increases or the Bank relaxes its lending conditions. While the economy has certainly slowed since the turn of the year, it is not about to plummet into recession. Sharply higher interest rates from the Bank would certainly kill off demand for property, but that doesn\u2019t look likely either. Meanwhile, a good chunk of the homes that are being built appear to be going to overseas buyers who have found their money goes further as a result of the depreciation in sterling. In short, the economy has reverted to the state it was in before George Osborne gave the housing market a boost halfway through the last parliament. Two policies, Funding for Lending and help to buy, got mortgage lending going again and led to stronger growth. But this was a sugar rush. There was a limit to how far house prices could rise and that limit has been reached. Many of those who are ostensibly gaining from rising house prices are opening branches of the bank of mum and dad so their offspring can buy their first home. The prospect now is a period in which house price inflation hovers around zero, but this is to be welcomed rather than feared. All the major recessions in the economy over the past four decades have come after unsustainable housing booms; the periods when the economy has rebalanced towards manufacturing and investment, such as the mid 1990s, have been when house price inflation has been weak. Growth in 2017 will rely less on the strength of the housing market and more on the ability of UK exporters to take advantage of a more competitive currency and pickup in global demand. Britain could learn something from other countries, namely that you don\u2019t need rising house prices or even high levels of owner occupation to be rich and successful. Germany has done just fine, even though it has a far bigger rented sector than Britain and has had much lower levels of house price inflation. Research by Andrew Oswald and Danny Blanchflower shows rising home ownership leads to a subsequent increase in unemployment, because owner occupation affects labour mobility, increases congestion costs and encourages Nimby-style behaviour that means fewer new businesses. The correlation holds true across the developed countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and in individual US states. There is no evidence that buying a house means you personallly lose your job a couple of years down the line, which suggests Britons will not easily be turned on by the idea of becoming a nation of renters. But the idea that high levels of renting can be associated with a dynamic local economy is supported by the evidence of London, which is thriving even though buying a home is a distant dream for most young people. It may also explain why unemployment was so low in the 1950s and 60s, when councils were building homes to rent. Sooner or later, a politician is going to be brave enough to say Britain has got housing policy completely wrong. They will say, quite correctly, that there is no future in an economy so heavily reliant on a housing market that lurches from boom to bust. They will demand that the shackles be taken off local authorities so they can tackle a homelessness crisis. They will accept that Britain\u2019s taxation system encourages demand for housing, while the planning system discourages supply, and act accordingly. That would mean reform of a property tax system that manages to stimulate demand, encourage land hoarding and be regressive all at the same time. It would also mean taking on the biggest vested interest in Britain: owner occupiers who, through luck rather than skill, have amassed considerable wealth as a result of soaring housing prices. Which is why it is not going to happen any time soon.",

Compared to its rival Sports Direct, JD Sports Fashion is the explorer wearing the trainers. Both have seen their reputations savaged by reports of poor working conditions at their warehouses. But while Mike Ashley\u2019s Sports Direct has also suffered the pain of watching its profits fall faster than stretched tracksuit bottoms whose elastic has gone, JD Sports Fashion has been fighting fit. It has benefited from expansion in Europe, coupled with a focus on what it called the more \u201caspirational\u201d end of the market. The difference in the two companies\u2019 fortunes will be all the more galling for Ashley, who sold \u00a312.5m shares in JD nearly a year ago, only to see it prosper. After \u201cexceptional\u201d Christmas trading, JD promised that annual profits would be up again, a year on from reporting a 45% rise in earnings. The company will reveal detailed figures on Tuesday, when it is likely to show Sports Direct a clean pair of heels once again. Sales boost smartens WH Smith outlook In what is shaping up to be a relatively quiet week for results, WH Smith is due to release profit figures for the first six months of the year on Wednesday. There\u2019s no word from the company as yet on whether it will be offering a discount jumbo-sized bar of Dairy Milk to go with the figures.

Its stores may not be to Daunt\u2019s taste but, after a streak of declining sales and underinvestment that lasted more than a decade, the chain has been looking rather less dog-eared lately. Shares in WH Smith, which can trace its history back to 1792, have been rising steadily in 2017 since it recorded the strongest sales figures in 14 years last October. In January it raised annual profit forecasts, citing a boost from sales of spoof children\u2019s books such as Five on Brexit Island, a nod to Enid Blyton.

      "bodyText": "There is nothing one can do to avoid natural disasters, or \u201cacts of God\u201d as they used to be called. But the prospect of Brexit is a man-made disaster. I say prospect because it hasn\u2019t happened yet and could still be avoided, despite the fact there seem to be a lot of people around who think it has already happened. The \u201cbest face\u201d and rationalisation process has already begun. Last week saw inspired reports that, on her trip to Saudi Arabia, Theresa May was softening her tone from the earlier approach towards a \u201chard Brexit\u201d. As more evidence becomes apparent of the consequences of abandoning the single market that the heroine of the Tory right, one Margaret Thatcher, did so much to help create, the unfortunate truth must have dawned on May that no deal is the worst possible outcome. Our counterparts on the continent have known this all along. As the European council president, Donald Tusk, has pointed out, they do not need to \u201cpunish\u201d us: by rashly accepting the result of an unbinding, consultative referendum, our leaders are inflicting on this nation enough punishment on their own. They are also running the risk of fomenting centrifugal forces in Europe that threaten to undo the good work of the post-second-world-war settlement. As Guy Verhofstadt of the European parliament said last week, the referendum was the result of \u201ca catfight in the Conservative party that got out of hand\u201d. By calling the referendum in the first place, Cameron was offering a sop to the Cerberus of the Tory Brexiters. But in Greek mythology Cerberus was never satisfied, and demanded more. Cameron seems to be coming out in his true colours, blithely declaring on a trip to Kiev that he never much cared for certain things \u201cEuropean\u201d anyway. His view is that the poison that was infecting the health of the Tory party had to be removed somehow. Personally I don\u2019t think the rampant Brexiters, whose views on Europe are chronically poisonous, will ever be satisfied. Meanwhile the poison will spread to the entire British economy. It is not good enough to derive comfort from the way reality is dawning and concessions are already in the diplomatic pipeline over the phasing of \u201ctransitional arrangements\u201d. To anyone with eyes to see and ears to hear, it is abundantly clear that many expats, both continental and British, are extremely worried about their future status and freedom to travel around Europe \u2013 as, for that matter, are many of us who are not expats. And multinational firms and banks are making strategic decisions now: they cannot afford to wait, and rely on promises and statements from the government which seem to change tone with remarkable rapidity. In an article in the Observer last week, Ed Miliband and Hilary Benn wrote that, for those who voted Leave, the result represented \u201ca deep sense that the country wasn\u2019t working for them, and that politics hadn\u2019t been providing good enough answers for a long time\u201d. Well, one can agree with that. The irony is that the protest vote should have taken place in the general election, which took place after five years of unjustifiable austerity \u2013 a policy and outcome which contributed hugely to that feeling that the country was \u201cnot working\u201d for so many. But my impression is that the swing vote in the referendum was determined by comfortably off people \u2013 of whom I have met many \u2013 well into their late middle and old age, who swallowed all that misleading, indeed lying, propaganda about the evils of regulation attributed to Brussels but almost always approved, and often initiated, by British governments. The same goes for all that nonsense about regaining sovereignty, which we have never lost. Alas, the British electorate was hardly assisted by years and years of anti-EU attitudes manifested by both major political parties. When Cameron went to Brussels for a \u201clast supper\u201d after the referendum, it was put to him rather forcibly: what did you expect after all that hostility? All right. The positive case for the EU was never made strongly or widely enough, and it is no use crying over spilt milk. But the positive case for European cooperation and reconsideration of Brexit may be made as the rather frightening implications of the world views of Putin and Trump become more evident. When Harold Macmillan, prime minister 1957-63, made his famous remark that what he feared most was \u201cthe opposition of events, dear boy\u201d, he was also having a go at the weakness of the divided Labour opposition at the time. It is a commonplace that Jeremy Corbyn was lukewarm at best in support of the Remain campaign, and one can hardly move in this country without people complaining that \u201cthere is no opposition\u201d. So what hope is there, other than \u201cevents\u201d \u2013 which may not be welcome in themselves, but which might provoke a rethink about this colossal waste of time and resources being devoted to Brexit? (I should much rather be writing about something else, by the way, but I regard this as the biggest crisis of my journalistic career.) Well, one hope is that there might be a revolt of the young, who stand to lose far more than the comfortably off \u201csovereignty\u201d brigade. It is part of the democratic process for losers in an election to start fighting back the day after the result. Nigel Farage did not accept the people had spoken in 1975, and was on the rampage for decades. If there is a sufficient movement of the young against Brexit, and if it is sufficient to sway the opinion polls, than perhaps there may be a groundswell for the nation to have a rethink. I have not given up hope, and am heartened by the number of people I meet who haven\u2019t either!",

      "bodyText": "Forget the warm handshake. Take with a pinch of salt Donald Trump\u2019s talk of his \u201cvery, very, great relationship\u201d with Xi Jinping. The idea that Washington has ceased to harbour deep suspicions of Beijing just because the presidents of the world\u2019s two biggest economies shared pleasantries over steak in Florida is fanciful. Xi will certainly be hoping Trump\u2019s cordial welcome was for real, because China has much more to lose economically from a trade war than America does. This might sound counter-intuitive given that Beijing can deploy the economic nuclear option if Trump makes good on his campaign pledge to slap whopping tariffs on Chinese imports. The US owes China more than $1 trillion and Xi could send America\u2019s economy into a tailspin by sanctioning a dumping of US Treasury bonds. But the problem with nuclear missiles is that they are never really intended to be fired, and if they are, there are no winners. Sure, China could cause enormous damage to the US, but only by damaging itself. Indeed, the US-China relationship is a classic example of the old saw: if you owe the bank a thousand dollars, you have a problem; if you owe the bank a trillion dollars, the bank has a problem. Trump holds the important cards and it is simply a case of whether he wants to play them. As Brian Davidson of the US\u2019s Fathom consultancy has pointed out, the Chinese leadership is keen to avoid the social and political unrest a trade war with the US would inevitably bring. Beijing\u2019s willingness to pump the economy full of credit to finance unprofitable investment demonstrates its determination to avoid a sharp rise in unemployment. China depends on the US in a way the US does not depend on China. Nearly 4% of China\u2019s GDP comes directly from exports to the US, while the equivalent figure for the US is less than 1%. There are several other countries that could provide the US with the manufactured goods it gets from China, but China would have real trouble finding an alternative to the US as an export market. Trump has expressed in blunt, often bellicose, terms his unhappiness with the way China conducts its trade, but according to Davidson he has a point. \u201cThe US position in these trade negotiations is strengthened by international trade law, and by China\u2019s systematic violation of obligations under World Trade Organisation rules. The US has scope to open, and win, lawsuits against China at the WTO, a point not lost on both leaders.\u201d Xi clearly hopes that Trump can be talked down from the aggressively anti-Beijing stance he adopted on the campaign trail, and arrived for his talks armed with a few vague promises about future Chinese investment in the US. This is not going to be enough to satisfy Trump, who has made action on America\u2019s $350bn a year trade deficit with China a touchstone of his presidency. It was a coincidence that the Florida t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate took place on the night the White House launched airstrikes on Syria, but the message will not have been lost on the Chinese president: Trump\u2019s impetuosity makes him hard to read. Beijing has been left guessing about what it will actually take to stop Trump slapping a 45% tariff on all Chinese exports. The answer is that it will probably require Xi to remove the barriers that make it hard for hi-tech US companies to export to China. Even then, there is likely to be some US protectionism in sectors \u2013 such as steel \u2013 that are politically sensitive in the rust-belt states that carried Trump to victory. There will be less talk in the months ahead of China \u201craping\u201d the US, but that simply means the current occupant of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue has learned from one of his predecessors, Teddy Roosevelt, to speak softly and carry a big stick. Unilever is safe. But it won\u2019t forget its own naivety Unilever, the maker of Magnum, Dove and Persil, has unveiled its strategic overhaul after fighting off a hostile takeover bid from Kraft Heinz worth $143bn (\u00a3115bn). The consumer goods group is to sell or spin off its margarine business \u2013 which includes Flora \u2013 accelerate its cost-cutting plans, spend \u20ac5bn (\u00a34.3bn) buying back its own shares and review its Anglo-Dutch structure. This last point could have political ramifications, given the review is being conducted against a backdrop of Brexit: it could eventually lead to Unilever leaving its UK tax base and moving jobs, although company insiders insist that is not on the table at the moment. Unilever\u2019s announcement, however, was reactionary. The big question for chief executive Paul Polman and the board is why these changes have come after an aggressive takeover approach that they ridiculed and picked apart. Polman has not been shy about promoting the importance of a long-term strategy and major companies contributing positively to the world. But he now looks to have been naive about the environment in which he was operating. To be fair, Polman has been frank about the bid being a \u201cnear death\u201d experience from which the company has learned. Furthermore, he has been decisive in making changes. The bid from Kraft Heinz was revealed on 17 February, and withdrawn two days later. But less than seven weeks after that, Unilever had announced the review and completed it. The changes also look sensible. The sale of the underperforming margarine division has been under consideration for some time, while the proposed cost-cutting and share buybacks are small relative to the size of the company. Together, the measures send a message that Unilever will never be an easy takeover target for the likes of Kraft Heinz or anyone else considering a debt-laden, slash-and-burn strategy. Nonetheless, the aura surrounding Polman and his team has been greatly reduced by this saga. Investors and MPs try to corral runaway pay at last Could it be that we are finally reaching peak executive pay? The business select committee has just recommended that long-term incentive plans \u2013 the schemes behind so many egregious pay awards \u2013 be axed. It is LTIPs that produce the worst excesses \u2013 like the lion\u2019s share of the \u00a3210m handed to WPP\u2019s Sir Martin Sorrell since 2012. They dish out an average of \u00a31.5m to each FTSE 100 boss a year, often reward pedestrian performance and can produce huge payouts as result of nothing more than luck \u2013 like a rise in commodities prices. Other loud voices are also demanding change, finally recognising that runaway executive pay is eroding trust in business. BlackRock, the world\u2019s biggest fund manager, wants an end to directors\u2019 pay that grows faster than ordinary employees\u2019. On Friday the world\u2019s biggest sovereign wealth fund \u2013 Norway\u2019s $910bn oil fund \u2013 also demanded an end to LTIPs. Remuneration committees must, surely, start to take note.",

Even then, there is likely to be some US protectionism in sectors \u2013 such as steel \u2013 that are politically sensitive in the rust-belt states that carried Trump to victory.</p> <p>There will be less talk in the months ahead of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/may/02/donald-trump-in-indiana-accuses-china-of-raping-the-us-over-trade-video\">China \u201craping\u201d the US</a>, but that simply means the current occupant of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue has learned from one of his predecessors, Teddy Roosevelt, to speak softly and carry a big stick.</p> <h2>Unilever is safe. But it won\u2019t forget its own naivety</h2> <p>Unilever, the maker of Magnum, Dove and Persil, has unveiled its strategic overhaul after fighting off a hostile takeover bid from Kraft Heinz worth <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/feb/19/kraft-heinz-unilever-shareholders-lobbies-uk-government-takeoverbid\">$143bn (\u00a3115bn).</a></p> <p>The consumer goods group is to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/apr/06/unilever-flora-stork-kraft-heinz-bid\">sell or spin off its margarine business</a> \u2013 which includes Flora \u2013 accelerate its cost-cutting plans, spend \u20ac5bn (\u00a34.3bn) buying back its own shares and review its Anglo-Dutch structure. This last point could have political ramifications, given the review is being conducted against a backdrop of Brexit: it could eventually lead to Unilever leaving its UK tax base and moving jobs, although company insiders insist that is not on the table at the moment.</p> <p>Unilever\u2019s announcement, however, was reactionary. The big question for chief executive Paul Polman and the board is why these changes have come after an aggressive takeover approach that they ridiculed and picked apart.</p> <p>Polman has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/25/unilever-ceo-paul-polman-the-optimistic-pessimist\">not been shy about promoting the importance of a long-term strategy and major companies contributing positively to the world.</a> But he now looks to have been naive about the environment in which he was operating.</p> <p>To be fair, Polman has been frank about the bid being a \u201cnear death\u201d experience from which the company has learned. Furthermore, he has been decisive in making changes. The bid from Kraft Heinz was revealed on 17 February, and withdrawn two days later. But less than seven weeks after that, Unilever had announced the review and completed it.</p> <p>The changes also look sensible. The sale of the underperforming margarine division has been under consideration for some time, while the proposed cost-cutting and share buybacks are small relative to the size of the company.</p> <p>Together, the measures send a message that Unilever will never be an easy takeover target for the likes of Kraft Heinz or anyone else considering a debt-laden, slash-and-burn strategy. Nonetheless, the aura surrounding Polman and his team has been greatly reduced by this saga.</p> <h2>Investors and MPs try to corral runaway pay at last</h2> <p>Could it be that we are finally reaching peak executive pay? The business select committee has just recommended that long-term incentive plans \u2013 the schemes behind so many egregious pay awards \u2013 be axed. It is LTIPs that produce the worst excesses \u2013 like the lion\u2019s share of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/mar/09/sir-martin-sorrell-earnings-wpp-chief-executive-ftse-100\">\u00a3210m handed to WPP\u2019s Sir Martin Sorrell</a> since 2012. They dish out an average of \u00a31.5m to each FTSE 100 boss a year, often reward pedestrian performance and can produce huge payouts as result of nothing more than luck \u2013 like a rise in commodities prices.</p> <p>Other loud voices are also demanding change, finally recognising that runaway executive pay is eroding trust in business. BlackRock, the world\u2019s biggest fund manager, wants an end to directors\u2019 pay that grows faster than ordinary employees\u2019. On Friday the world\u2019s biggest sovereign wealth fund \u2013 Norway\u2019s $910bn oil fund \u2013 also demanded an end to LTIPs.</p> <p>Remuneration committees must, surely, start to take note.</p>",
