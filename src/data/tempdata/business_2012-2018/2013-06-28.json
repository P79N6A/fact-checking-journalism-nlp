      "bodyText": "An inquiry into racism in British banks' lending practices, ordered by Nick Clegg 19 months ago, is still to be published even though it is understood a draft was completed more than a year ago. The deputy prime minister called for action in a landmark speech in November 2011 designed to coincide with the 30th anniversary of the Scarman report into the Brixton riots. He said the government needed to find out what was preventing ethnic minorities accessing loans and told banks that they had more responsibility than anyone to unleash ethnic minority talent. Chuka Umunna, the shadow business secretary on Friday expressed concern at the extraordinary delay, pointing out that unemployment among some ethnic minorities in the meantime has reached 60%. He said: \"The fact that a draft report written by officials at public expense has been gathering dust on a ministerial desk for over a year is a terrible indictment of a government that has consistently failed to deliver for British business.\" Clegg promised to bring the then minister for race and cohesion, Sir Andrew Stunell, together with \"some of the best experts in finance\" to look at the barriers facing ethnic minorities. Sir Andrew was dismissed from the communities department last summer, and has been forced to resort to tabling questions to his successor and fellow Liberal Democrat Don Foster to ask whether the report is due to be published. Clegg's office said the report has taken longer than hoped, but it is very nearly ready and will be published at the end of the summer or early autumn. Sir Andrew did hold discussions with the British Bankers Association and, in talks with an ethnic minority advisory group on 23 April 2012, minutes referred to a draft report being completed. In a written reply in June, Sir Andrew said the report would be published shortly. The report was due to look at whether small or medium-sized enterprises run by ethnic minorities were being blocked from loans, or lacked the confidence to apply. Clegg at the launch of the inquiry said figures on how many ethnic minority applications for loans are successful were scarce.

      "bodyText": "Leading shares suffered their worst monthly fall for more than a year in June, wiping \u00a394bn off the value of Britain's top 100 companies, while the price of gold recorded its biggest quarterly decline for 45 years, on continuing concerns the US Federal Reserve may wind down its huge stimulus package for the American economy this year. Worries about a credit crunch in China added to the volatility after the country's central bank acted to curb speculative lending during the week, while a scandal over Anglo Irish bank traders joking about its \u20ac30bn (\u00a325bn) bailout and talk of derivatives losses in Italy reminded investors the eurozone crisis was far from over. The FTSE 100 closed at 6215.47 on Friday, down 27.93 points on the day and 5.6% since the start of June. That marked its biggest monthly percentage loss since May 2012. So a volatile quarter which saw the index come within 90 points of its all time high at 6840 ended with a 3% decline, its worst three month drop since this time last year. Even so, it has still recorded a 4.5% rise so far this year. Meanwhile gold hit its lowest level for three years on Thursday, falling to $1,180 before recovering to $1,210 on Friday. Its 25% decline over the three months from April to June marks the precious metal's worst quarterly performance since 1968. The shine has rapidly come off gold since it hit highs of $1,895 an ounce in 2011, buoyed by its status as a safe haven for investors. Gold is used by investors as a hedging bet against rising inflation, but fears of a reduction in quantitative easing are damping concerns about higher prices because less central bank cash will ultimately flow into financial institutions. The strengthening dollar also makes the metal more expensive for non-US currency investors. Chinese traders have stopped buying gold, while demand in India has also been muted. \"Everything that had been driving gold up has gone into reverse,\" said Julian Jessop, chief economist at Capital Economics. \"Gold's own status as a safe haven has been undermined by the recent weakness and volatility in prices, at the same time as the markets are regaining confidence in the US dollar.\" The recent rout has hit not just equities and precious metals, but also base commodities, bonds, oil and most currencies apart from the dollar. US bond investors are set for their worst quarterly performance since 1994. The initial catalyst for the turmoil came on 22 May \u2013 just at the FTSE 100 hit a near 13 year peak \u2013 when US Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke first signalled he might start reining in the bank's $85bn (\u00a356bn) a month bond buying programme, and accelerated when he repeated the comments just over a week ago. Markets had been strongly supported by central bank actions to stimulate the global economy and took fright at the idea the money taps could be switched off. Over the past few days a number of Federal Reserve members tried to suggest the reaction to Bernanke's comments had been exaggerated, helping to stem some of the decline. But with mixed economic data from America on Friday, investors were looking ahead nervously to the US non-farm payroll figures next week for further clues to the Fed's thinking. The People's Bank of China \u2013 which sparked talk of a credit crunch in the country by letting short term borrowing costs jump to record highs to discourage banks from reckless lending \u2013 also weighed in to calm markets. After soothing if gnomic comments from officials earlier in the week that they would act if necessary, the central bank's governor Zhou Xiaochuan said on Friday: \"We will use all kinds of tools and methods to appropriately adjust liquidity and to maintain the overall stability of markets.\" The plunge in gold prices has taken analysts by surprise. Judging where gold would sink to was \"like catching a falling knife\", said Jessop. \"Now is perhaps not the best time to try to call the bottom in the price of gold. Nonetheless, it seems premature to write gold off completely.\" Capital Economics is predicting gold will be at $1,320 an ounce by the end of the year, down from an earlier forecast of $1,700, while Goldman Sachs recently predicted that gold prices would fall to around $1,050 by the end of 2014.",

      "bodyText": "After another turbulent week, European shares have recorded their first monthly loss in just over a year, writes Nick Fletcher. The main impetus for the fall continues to be the worries that central banks will turn off the money taps, following recent comments from US Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke. No matter how many Fed officials step up to say the reaction to the comments has been exaggerated, the genie is really out of the bottle now and further market volatility is likely. Here are the daily movements across the markets: \u2022 The FTSE 100 fell 27.93 points or 0.45% to 6215.47 \u2022 Germany's Dax is down 0.39% to 7959 \u2022 France's Cac closed 0.62% lower at 3738 \u2022 italy's FTSE MIB fell 1.24% to 15,239 \u2022 Spain's Ibex was 1.04% down at 7762 \u2022 But the Athens market bucked the trend, up 2.5% at 847.5 Meanwhile on Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 61 points or 0.41% lower. On that note, it's time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments and we'll be back again on Monday morning. Leaders are heading back to their home nations after the Summit, so here's a summary of what was achieved, and what wasn't. \u2022 Today's talks began after EU leaders had agreed to commit up to \u20ac8bn to fight youth unemployment. The deal was hailed as a key step forward by Commission president Jose Manuel Barroso... but European Parliament president Martin Schulz said it was only a 'drop in the bucket'. (see 8.38am onwards for details) \u2022 David Cameron also warned that the youth unemployment commitment wasn't enough. The UK PM told reporters after the two-day summit ended that money alone couldn't get young people into work. Only growth would do that. \u2022 Cameron also took a pop at French negotiators who he accused of trying to reopen the issue of Britain's EU rebate. There was little sign of cordial relations between the two counties - perhaps Britain's plan to fund the restoration the battlefield of Waterloo didn't go down well in Paris. \u2022 Cameron also revealed he was organising an anti red-tape business task force. They would find examples of European legislation that could be snipped out to help businesses grow. See 12.46pm onwards for highlights of Cameron's press conference. \u2022 During today's meeting, EU leaders also agreed to allow Latvia to join the eurozone, and welcomed Croatia to the EU (see 11.36am). They also agreed to open accession talks with Serbia (see 12.29pm) \u2022 Irish PM Enda Kenny admitted that the Ango Irish tape scandal which broke this week, showing top bankers laughing and making anti-German jokes as they haggled for a bailout, had hurt Ireland. Kenny said the tapes showed a 'toxic nexus' had existed between the banking industry and politicians during the 'tiger years'. Highlights here: 1.18pm and video of Kenny here: \u2022 Elsewhere... Angela Merkel suggested Europe might need treaty changes before a single authority to handle failed banks could be created (see here), while Francois Hollande admitted that France needs to do more to tame its deficit (see here). So, not a disaster of a Summit. But perhaps a missed opportunity to do more. With the threat of a euro break-up diminished, and the financial markets more interested in when America's stimulus package might end, EU leaders may feel under less pressure. And that can easily translate into less progress..... Here's a video clip of Irish PM Enda Kenny speaking at the EU Summit this afternoon, when he laid into the former bosses of Anglo Irish bank over the secret recordings which emerged this week (see 1.18pm) Luxembourg's Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker argued that more should have been achieved during the two-day summit. Speaking to reporters as he left Brussels, Juncker said that leaders \"have bid farewell to the somewhat further reaching ideas.\" Juncker added: I would have wished for a little more forward-looking dynamic, not a dynamic of stagnation. The feeling in and around Brussels is that the Summit really fell short on the issue of unemployment. The \u20ac8bn youth unemployment commitment isn't terribly new -- and as David Cameron argued, it won't create the economic growth that's needed. A new book was launched to coincide with the EU summit, which takes European leaders and top officials to task for their blunders since the crisis began. Snappily titled Basta! An end to Austerity, it analyses the policy mistakes since 2008, and calls for a new push from the progressive left - through initiatives like a social pact, stronger democratic control. It's particularly scathing about European Commissioner Olli Rehn, saying \"Olli\u2019s folly\" was to believe that tough austerity measures were needed to drive down public spending. In a nutshell, the European Commission and the centre-Right majority of EU governments have adopted a \u201cfallacious diagnosis\u201d that \u201c\ufb01scal pro\ufb02igacy\u201d or excessive state spending is to blame for Europe\u2019s continuing problems in escaping from the economic mire induced in 2008-09 by the original sin of the banking crisis. They took a sledgehammer \u2013 extreme austerity across the entire and very fragile EU \u2013 to crack the wrong nut. It's written by Hannes Swoboda, president of the socialist and democratic group in the European Parliament, and our former European business editor David Gow. You can read more, download a digital copy, or order a print version, here. Francois Hollande admitted that France's national debt is a serious challenge. He told his press conference that the blame lies with former French leaders, having already suggested this morning that the 2013 deficit could breach Paris's target of 3.7% of GDP (see 10.17am). Our former European business editor, David Gow, was there and tweeted the highlights: David Cameron also rejected a Tory MP's calls for an amnesty for illegal immigrants, warning it would send out a \"terrible signal\". The PM showed little enthusiasm for backbencher Nadhim Zahawi's proposal that the Conservatives could 'reconnect' with voters from ethnic minorities by bringing in an amnesty, and also stimulate growth. Press Association has the details: The Prime Minister insisted that while he considered Mr Zahawi a \"very bright MP\" with a \"lot to offer\", this was \"not a good idea\". The premier, asked at a Brussels press conference about the call for the party to consider the move, said an amnesty would send a \"terrible signal\" that Britain was a \"soft touch\". \"It is not a good idea... I have never supported an amnesty,\" he told reporters. German chancellor Angela Merkel may have set up a roadblock in front of Europe's march towards banking union, telling her press conference that Treaty changes may be needed first. Reuters has the story: German Chancellor Angela Merkel insisted on Friday that a single European authority to deal with failed banks would require a change in the European Union's treaty, raising an obstacle to the planned next step towards EU banking union. European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said the EU executive will issue proposals for such a banking resolution mechanism in the next two weeks. EU officials dispute the need to amend the treaty, but Berlin is sensitive because of the scrutiny of its constitutional court. \"Germany has made clear that under the current treaties the Commission does not have the competence to run such a central authority or act as a resolution body. If we want new competencies then they must be linked to treaty changes,\" Merkel said. Talk of treaty changes may get David Cameron's ears twitching, given his push to repatriate some powers from Brussels.... Herman Van Rompuy also gave a press conference, and the European Council president has helpfully tweeted a link. It's all terribly upbeat: Last night we decided two key sets of actions: First, to promote jobs for youth, not least by scaling up our Youth Employment Initiative to \u20ac8bn euro, with most of the money concentrated in the first two years. As the budget unrolls, any funds left unspent will go in priority to employment. Also, to help millions of SMEs, the biggest employers in our countries, get through the credit crunch in some countries, we will combine funds from the EU budget and the European Investment Bank. That was yesterday. And today marks two historic milestones: for Croatia and the Balkans, but also for the eurozone, with Latvia set to join. Van Rompuy also claimed leaders were steadily building bridges towards banking union. But elsewhere in the EU headquarters, Germany's Angela Merkel sounded less positive.... (stay tuned!). Associated Press's Jurgen Baetz has the Cameron quote on youth unemployment: David Cameron's team have now tweeted about the PM's new assault on EU red tape (which sounds a little Yes Ministerish) As explained at 12.46pm, Cameron has asked a team of UK business leaders (who he didn't name) to come up with new ideas of superfluous regulations in time for the next summit. Irish PM Enda Kenny has admitted that the discloses of secret tapes of executives at Anglo Irish bank laughing, joking, and mocking Germany during its bailout talks have damaged Ireland's reputation. Kenny said the tapes, disclosed by the Irish Independent this week, were a \"thunderbolt\", adding that they showed \"the contempt and the arrogance and the insolence\" of senior people in the bank towards everyone. (update: just watched a video clip again and it's 'insolence' not 'indolence' as first written. Apologies) Kenny added that it shows there had been a \"toxic nexus\" between the banking industry and Irish politicians during the 'tiger years' days before the financial crisis. He said the tapes \"have damaged our reputation\", but that EU leaders understood that these incidents occured in the past. He also spoke about the need for those individuals who know the full inside story of the collapse of Ireland's banking sector, triggering the country's bailout, to come forward. Kenny's comments, at his press conference following today's EU summit, come after Angela Merkel called the tapes 'contemptible'. The revelation that Anglo Irish top executives sang Deutschland, Deutschland, \u00fcber alles\" after winning a state guarantee for their deposits has clearly caused offence both at home and abroad. Jose Manuel Barroso, president of the European Commission, is also attending Enda Kenny's press conference. He's asked about comments from French officials that he has delivered nothing for Europe (details here). Barroso tries to shrug it off, saying: There are some comments that deserve no comment. Other press conferences are taking place across the EU headquarters. Ireland's Enda Kenny, in his final role as the EU presidency, is speaking now (livestream here). Kenny says the two-day summit has delivered real progress, citing the EU budget deal, the agreement on how to deal with failing EU banks, and the \u20ac8bn plan to fight youth jobless. Questions -- does David Cameron support the plan to spend \u20ac8bn fighting youth unemployment, which leaders agree last night? And how much impact will it have? The PM says the scheme will help, but on its own it won't do enough to reverse Europe's jobless challenge. You won't solve youth unemployment just by spending money. Instead, businesses need more help to take on more staff, he adds (which goes back to his crusade on EU red tape) Some background on the UK rebate issue -- French government officials argued last night that the agricultural grants to new EU members should not be included in calculations for the UK rebate. This would have trimmed Britain's annual \u00a33bn rebate by as much as 10%. UK negotiatiors, though, fought back hard -- thus Cameron's fighting talk in his press conference (see 12.46pm) Open Europe tweets Cameron's tough talk on the rebate: In Brussels, David Cameron is holding his press conference now. He begins by telling reporters that some progress has been made on cutting red tape, but not enough. So he is announcing a new taskforce of six British business leaders who will look at ways of cutting unnessary legislation. They will report back with recommendations in time for the next EU summit, he says. Cameron also blasts the other EU countries (ie France) who tried to cut Britain's rebate last night. Cameron insists that he had defended the deal made in February, saving UK taxpayers a total of \u00a31.5bn over the lifetime of the next budget. He also expressed bafflement that the issue had even been raised again, declaring: I have defeated this latest attempt to cut the rebate Interesting news in Britain. UKFI, which manages the taxpayers interests in Britain's financial sector, has invited banks to pitch for the privatisation of its stakes in Lloyds and Royal Bank of Scotland. It looks like another step closer to the formal privatisation of our stakes in one, or even both, banks. UKFI wants banks to declare their interest by next Monday. Here's the statement. Our banking expert, Jill Treanor, is on the case.... In a model of European efficiency, the summit is over -- now for the press conferences.... More news from the summit - leaders have decided to begin talks with Serbia over its future entry to the Euroean Union. Herman Van Rompuy tweeted the news: This comes hot on the heels of the decision to put an extra seat around the table for Latvia at future eurozone meetings (see 11.36am). Official talks with the Belgrade government should begin by next January. It's seen as a reward for the progress Serbia made towards better relations with its neighbours since the end of the Yugoslav Wars. As EU finance ministers stated last week: [Serbia\u2019s] continued visible and sustainable progress in the normalization of relations, including the implementation of the agreements reached so far, remains essential so Kosovo and Serbia can continue on their respective European paths. In the financial markets, the gold is looking increasingly tarnished after falling through the $1,200 per ounce mark. Gold has lost around 25% of its value over the last three months, and is now at its lowest level since August 2010. As my colleague Jennifer Rankin reports: Everything that had been driving gold up has gone into reverse,\" said Julian Jessop, chief economist at Capital Economics. Demand for safe havens was diminishing as the worst of the crisis in the eurozone appeared to be over, he said. At the same time, commodities were out of favour, Chinese and Indian demand for gold had dropped after a spring surge, while demand for protection against rising prices had faded amid falling expectations of inflation. \"Gold's own status as a safe haven has been undermined by the recent weakness and volatility in prices, at the same time as the markets are regaining confidence in the US dollar.\" More here: Gold price tumbles to three-year low EU leaders have approved Latvia's entry to the eurozone, and welcomed Croatia to the EU, as they rattle throught the agenda in Brussels. Latvia is now all set to join the euro on 1 January 2014, expanding the eurozone's membership to 18. Croatia's prime minister, Zoran Milanovi\u0107, is attending the summit and was presented with a special Union-warming present -- a signed photo of yesterday's family photo. Every house should have one. Latvia is one of the fastest-growing EU members, and its entry to the euro will push the single currency into the Baltic states. And as Ian Traynor explained earlier thls month: For Valdis Dombrovskis, Latvia's prime minister, joining the euro makes economic sense. It will bring budget savings, promote foreign direct investment and underpin the recovery from an economic collapse in 2008-9 that foreshadowed calamities to come elsewhere, especially in Ireland and Spain. But it's not all finance and economics. For the Baltic states, long at the mercy of an imperial Russia, whether tsarist or communist, and perennially wary of Vladimir Putin, the euro is also intensely political. Latvia: the eurozone member-elect whose growth is the envy of them all A couple more photos from the Summit have arrived: It's not clear what Italy's Enrico Letta, Francois Hollande and Spain's Mariano Rajoy find so fascinating. Presumably not the latest French economic data? Elsewhere in the room, Germany's Angela Merkel and Herman van Rompuy, EC president, have been going through another document - and appear to be giving officials a grilling as EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton looks on: Back in Brussels, Francois Hollande has admitted that his government could miss its deficit target for this year. Speaking to reporters, the French president blamed weak tax receipts for pushing up French borrowing requirements. Reuters has the details: \"There is a risk that we will have less revenue than expected,\" Hollande said, adding that this would result in \"a little more deficit\" at the end of the year. The admission came a day after the country's auditor issued a blunt warning that the French deficit will probably be closer to 4% than the 3.7% official target. The Court of Auditors warned on Thursday there was no chance of France getting its deficit down to 3% of GDP \u2013 the EU's target \u2013 without significant spending cuts. Hollande argued this morning that Paris must stimulate economic growth, while keeping spending on a tight leash. He said: First, everything possible for there to be more growth in the second half of the year...But what France must do for 2013 is contain public spending. Spending in 2013 must be strictly equal to 2012 spending. China's top central banker has pledged to keep the country's financial markets running smoothly. In his first public speech since the panic over the squeeze on its shadow banking sector began, governor Zhou Xiaochuan said the People's Bank of China would not neglect its responsibilities. Zhou said: We will use all kinds of tools and methods to appropriately adjust liquidity and to maintain the overall stability of markets. The Xinhua News Agency, the official press agency of the People's Republic of China, said Zhou had promised to maintain \"prudent\" monetary policy (more here). Gordon Brown would approve.... Over in Brussels, a group of EU civil servants are protesting against pay cuts and job losses, in the final day of a three-day walkout (details here). The FT's Peter Spiegel reports that they're inside the security cordon: Francois Hollande would be forgiven for having his mind on domestic issues today, with the latest economic news underlining the challenge he faces back home. France's national debt has hit a new record high of \u20ac1.87 trillion euros, or 91.7% of GDP, the INSEE statistics office reported - up from 90.2% three months earlier. Paris is budgeting for the debt stock to peak at 94.3% in 2014, but with the country in recession there are growing fears that targets could be missed. INSEE's report (details here) showed how French national debt has swelled, as a percentage of national output, since the crisis began: Can Hollande turn it around? Other data released this morning offers some hope -- with consumer spending rising by 0.5% in May versus April. That's surprising, given French consumer confidence is at an all-time low (as revealed yesterday). And the latest producer price data is somewhat alarming too -- the prices of goods leaving French factories fell by 1.2% month-on-month in May, suggesting suppliers are having to trim prices due to lack of demand. The prices levied for energy, manufactured goods, and imported industrial products all fell, creating what INSEE dubbed a \"significant decline in industrial prices on the French market\". More here. Reuters flags up that the total funding for Europe's new youth employment drive could reach \u20ac8bn, as leaders also agreed to use unspend funds from other projects to fight the crisis. Here's their take: Europe's youth jobless drive meets with scepticism While AP points out that a classic Anglo-French spat over the British rebate distracted attention from cleaning up the economic mess in Europe: British Prime Minister David Cameron had held out for the same financial conditions already promised him months ago, overshadowing a summit meant to focus on the continent\u2019s youth unemployment problems. However, in the end, all 27 nations backed the budget deal. EU President Herman Van Rompuy said \u2018\u2018it is a quite clear \u2018yes\u2019,\u2019\u2019 when it came to unanimous backing of the 2014-2020 spending plan. More here: EU leaders win breakthrough on budget deal Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the latest events across the eurozone, the global economy and the financial markets. European leaders are gathering in Brussels for the second day of their economic summit, after agreeing new funding for youth unemployment and funding for small firms. Overnight, the 27 members of the EU agreed to spend \u20ac6bn between now and 2015 to fund training, apprenticeships and other job creation schemes for young people. Leaders also rubber-stamped the details of the next seven-year EU budget. And with yesterday's deals on bank bail-ins (details here) also in the can, there was a mood of calm optimism in Brussels. European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso was particularly bullish, telling reporters: The last 24 hours have been a great success. Today we have agreed the money to back up our words. But with youth unemployment running at over 50% in the worst affected countries, some eurocrats admitted that the \u20ac6bn scheme wouldn't be enough. Certainly without getting the eurozone back to growth. Martin Schulz, president of the European Parliament, was unimpressed, Deutsche Welle reports, pointing out: We spent 700 billion euros on the bank rescue system and now, after much hesitation, \u20ac6bn to fight youth unemployment. These 6 billion euros, we should be clear about it, are a drop in the bucket. Leaders should be arriving soon, where journalist are already being revived after another late-night session. Today will see David Cameron, UK prime minister, take on Brussels red tape after fighting off French attempts to trim Britain's precious rebate. PA has the details: Mr Cameron is taking the opportunity to urge looser labour market rules and deregulation to help small and medium sized companies. The premier has staked Britain's continuing membership of the EU on his ability to negotiate fundamental reform of it - with an in-out referendum due to be held in 2017 if the Tories win the general election. Mr Cameron could also face questions at the summit from German Chancellor Angela Merkel and others after it emerged that eavesdropping agency GCHQ has been mass-monitoring global phone and internet traffic. I'll be watching events in Brussels, along with other developments across the eurozone and beyond through the day....",

      "body": "<p>Until the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/marketforceslive/2013/jun/20/mining-ftse-slump-bernanke-china-manufacturing\" title=\"\">recent bout of financial-market turbulence</a>, a variety of risky assets (including equities, government bonds, and commodities) had been rallying since last summer. But, while risk aversion and volatility were falling and asset prices were rising, economic growth remained sluggish throughout the world. Now the global economy's chickens may be coming home to roost.</p> <p>Japan, struggling against two decades of stagnation and deflation, had to resort to Abenomics to avoid a quintuple-dip recession. In the UK, the debate since last summer has focused on the prospect of a triple-dip recession. Most of the eurozone remains mired in a severe recession \u2013 now spreading from the periphery to parts of the core. Even in the United States, economic performance has remained mediocre, with growth hovering around 1.5% for the last few quarters.</p> <p>And now the darlings of the world economy, emerging markets, have proved unable to reverse their own slowdowns. According to the IMF, China's annual GDP growth has slowed to 8%, from 10% in 2010; over the same period, India's growth rate slowed from 11.2% to 5.7%. Russia, Brazil, and South Africa are growing at around 3%, and other emerging markets are slowing as well.</p> <p>This gap between Wall Street and Main Street (rising asset prices, despite worse-than-expected economic performance) can be explained by three factors. First, the tail risks (low-probability, high-impact events) in the global economy \u2013 a eurozone breakup, the US going over its fiscal cliff, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2013/jun/25/china-stock-market-credit-crunch\" title=\"\">a hard economic landing for China</a>, a war between Israel and Iran over nuclear proliferation \u2013 are lower now than they were a year ago.</p> <p>Second, while growth has been disappointing in both developed and emerging markets, financial markets remain hopeful that better economic data will emerge in the second half of 2013 and 2014, especially in the US and Japan, with the UK and the eurozone bottoming out and most emerging markets returning to form. Optimists repeat the refrain that \"this year is different\": after a prolonged period of painful deleveraging, the global economy supposedly is on the cusp of stronger growth.</p> <p>Third, in response to slower growth and lower inflation (owing partly to lower commodity prices), the world's major central banks pursued another round of unconventional monetary easing: lower policy rates, forward guidance, quantitative easing (QE), and credit easing. Likewise, many emerging-market central banks reacted to slower growth and lower inflation by cutting policy rates as well.</p> <p>This massive wave of liquidity searching for yield fueled temporary asset-price reflation around the world. But there were two risks to liquidity-driven asset reflation. First, if growth did not recover and surprise on the upside (in which case high asset prices would be justified), eventually slow growth would dominate the levitational effects of liquidity and force asset prices lower, in line with weaker economic fundamentals. Second, it was possible that some central banks \u2013 namely the Fed \u2013 could pull the plug (or hose) by exiting from QE and zero policy rates.</p> <p>This brings us to the recent financial market turbulence. It was already evident in the first and second quarters of this year that growth in China and other emerging markets was slowing. This explains the underperformance of commodities and emerging-market equities even before the recent turmoil. But the Fed's recent signals of an early exit from QE \u2013 together with stronger evidence of China's slowdown and Chinese, Japanese, and European central bankers' failure to provide the additional monetary easing that investors expected \u2013 dealt emerging markets an additional blow.</p> <p>These countries have found themselves on the receiving end not only of a correction in commodity prices and equities, but also of a brutal re-pricing of currencies and both local- and foreign-currency fixed-income assets. Brazil and other countries that complained about \"hot money\" inflows and \"currency wars,\" have now suddenly gotten what they wished for: a likely early end of the Fed's QE. The consequences \u2013 sharp capital-flow reversals that are now hitting all risky emerging-market assets \u2013 have not been pretty.</p> <p>Whether the correction in risky assets is temporary or the start of a bear market will depend on several factors. One is whether the Fed will truly exit from QE as quickly as it signalled. There is a strong likelihood that weaker US growth and lower inflation will force it to slow the pace of its withdrawal of liquidity support.</p> <p>Another variable is how much easier monetary policies in other developed countries will become. The Bank of Japan, the European Central Bank, the Bank of England, and the Swiss National Bank are already easing policy as their economies' growth lags that of the US.

      "bodyText": "Until the recent bout of financial-market turbulence, a variety of risky assets (including equities, government bonds, and commodities) had been rallying since last summer. But, while risk aversion and volatility were falling and asset prices were rising, economic growth remained sluggish throughout the world. Now the global economy's chickens may be coming home to roost. Japan, struggling against two decades of stagnation and deflation, had to resort to Abenomics to avoid a quintuple-dip recession. In the UK, the debate since last summer has focused on the prospect of a triple-dip recession. Most of the eurozone remains mired in a severe recession \u2013 now spreading from the periphery to parts of the core. Even in the United States, economic performance has remained mediocre, with growth hovering around 1.5% for the last few quarters. And now the darlings of the world economy, emerging markets, have proved unable to reverse their own slowdowns. According to the IMF, China's annual GDP growth has slowed to 8%, from 10% in 2010; over the same period, India's growth rate slowed from 11.2% to 5.7%. Russia, Brazil, and South Africa are growing at around 3%, and other emerging markets are slowing as well. This gap between Wall Street and Main Street (rising asset prices, despite worse-than-expected economic performance) can be explained by three factors. First, the tail risks (low-probability, high-impact events) in the global economy \u2013 a eurozone breakup, the US going over its fiscal cliff, a hard economic landing for China, a war between Israel and Iran over nuclear proliferation \u2013 are lower now than they were a year ago. Second, while growth has been disappointing in both developed and emerging markets, financial markets remain hopeful that better economic data will emerge in the second half of 2013 and 2014, especially in the US and Japan, with the UK and the eurozone bottoming out and most emerging markets returning to form. Optimists repeat the refrain that \"this year is different\": after a prolonged period of painful deleveraging, the global economy supposedly is on the cusp of stronger growth. Third, in response to slower growth and lower inflation (owing partly to lower commodity prices), the world's major central banks pursued another round of unconventional monetary easing: lower policy rates, forward guidance, quantitative easing (QE), and credit easing. Likewise, many emerging-market central banks reacted to slower growth and lower inflation by cutting policy rates as well. This massive wave of liquidity searching for yield fueled temporary asset-price reflation around the world. But there were two risks to liquidity-driven asset reflation. First, if growth did not recover and surprise on the upside (in which case high asset prices would be justified), eventually slow growth would dominate the levitational effects of liquidity and force asset prices lower, in line with weaker economic fundamentals. Second, it was possible that some central banks \u2013 namely the Fed \u2013 could pull the plug (or hose) by exiting from QE and zero policy rates. This brings us to the recent financial market turbulence. It was already evident in the first and second quarters of this year that growth in China and other emerging markets was slowing. This explains the underperformance of commodities and emerging-market equities even before the recent turmoil. But the Fed's recent signals of an early exit from QE \u2013 together with stronger evidence of China's slowdown and Chinese, Japanese, and European central bankers' failure to provide the additional monetary easing that investors expected \u2013 dealt emerging markets an additional blow. These countries have found themselves on the receiving end not only of a correction in commodity prices and equities, but also of a brutal re-pricing of currencies and both local- and foreign-currency fixed-income assets. Brazil and other countries that complained about \"hot money\" inflows and \"currency wars,\" have now suddenly gotten what they wished for: a likely early end of the Fed's QE. The consequences \u2013 sharp capital-flow reversals that are now hitting all risky emerging-market assets \u2013 have not been pretty. Whether the correction in risky assets is temporary or the start of a bear market will depend on several factors. One is whether the Fed will truly exit from QE as quickly as it signalled. There is a strong likelihood that weaker US growth and lower inflation will force it to slow the pace of its withdrawal of liquidity support. Another variable is how much easier monetary policies in other developed countries will become. The Bank of Japan, the European Central Bank, the Bank of England, and the Swiss National Bank are already easing policy as their economies' growth lags that of the US. How much further they go may well be influenced in part by domestic conditions and in part by the extent to which weaker growth in China exacerbates downside risks in Asian economies, commodity exporters, and the US and the eurozone. A further slowdown in China and other emerging economies is another risk to financial markets. Then there is the question of how emerging market policymakers respond to the turbulence: will they raise rates to stem inflationary depreciation and capital outflows, or will they cut rates to boost flagging GDP growth, thus increasing the risk of inflation and of a sudden capital-flow reversal? Two final factors include how soon the eurozone economy bottoms out (there have been some recent signs of stabilisation, but the monetary union's chronic problems remain unresolved), and whether Middle East tensions and the threat of nuclear proliferation in the region \u2013 and responses to that threat by the US and Israel \u2013 escalate or are successfully contained. A new period of uncertainty and volatility has begun, and it seems likely to lead to choppy economies and choppy markets. Indeed, a broader de-risking cycle for financial markets could be at hand. \u2022 Nouriel Roubini is chairman of Roubini Global Economics and professor of economics at NYU's Stern School of Business.

The advert, placed by UK Financial Investments (UKFI), the body set up to look after the taxpayer stakes in the bailed-out banks, comes after the chancellor said he was ready to sell off Lloyds but was commissioning work on whether RBS should be broken up. In a Mansion House speech this month, George Osborne said he was \"actively considering options for share sales in Lloyds\", in which the taxpayer has a 39% stake. But he appeared to delay any sell-off of 81%-owned RBS by saying he would look at whether a bad bank should be hived off. The stake in Lloyds is unlikely to be sold before the bank's interim results on 1 August but Osborne has been careful not to put a timescale on any sell-off despite speculation he is eyeing a sale before the May 2015 general election.

UKFI, which is also seeking a new chief executive to replace Jim O'Neil who has resigned to return to the City, appears to expect to appoint a number of bankers. It is seeking bookrunners \u2013 the name for the lead banks on any sell-offs \u2013 co-lead managers, capital markets advisers and financial advisers who could take part in the team to oversee a share sale. Osborne told the Mansion House audience that he expected the first tranche of the Lloyds stake to be sold to big City institutions but indicated that the public would be given the chance to buy shares at a later stage. He did not give any clues as to how RBS might be sold off other than to say it was \"some way off\", despite the resignation of the bank's boss, Stephen Hester, in a move intended to speed up a sell-off.

Nonetheless, it seems premature to write gold off completely.\" Capital Economics is predicting gold will end the year at $1,320 per ounce, down from an earlier forecast of $1,700. Goldman Sachs recently predicted that gold prices would fall to around $1,050 by the end of 2014. The Standard &amp; Poor's rating agency also cut its price forecast for gold earlier this week, although it is banking on higher prices, with a long-term forecast of $1,200. The gloom about gold was not mirrored on Japan's stock market, with Asian shares up for the third consecutive day, following positive data about the expanding jobs market. The Nikkei index rose 3.5% on Friday, putting it on course to end the first half of the year 31% higher. The rally may be seen as a vote of confidence in the plan of the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, to restore the economy to health with a radical \u00a57tn (\u00a346bn) stimulus programme.",

It added it was on track to meet full year expectations with a modest improvement in organic revenue growth and margins maintained at the 2012 level. David Brockton at Espirito Santo issued a buy note, saying: Serco is steadily building a balanced portfolio of international outsourcing businesses serving business process outsourcing, defence, transport, health and the justice markets.

Mike Allen at Panmure Gordon was also fairly positive: First half organic growth is trending ahead of our full year expectations, although margins are likely to be slightly below those of last year due to bidding costs, which is slightly disappointing. However, we think there is scope for Serco to close the valuation gap versus Capita and Babcock and are likely to maintain our forecasts and target price of 700p. Overall the FTSE 100 is up 5.51 points at 6248.91. But on the last trading day of the month, it still means the index has lost nearly 340 points or more than 5% since the beginning of June. That would be the first monthly loss for more than a year and the biggest monthly percentage fall since June 2010. A quarter which saw the index come within 90 points of its all time high at 6840 is ending with a more than 150 point loss over the three months. Markets have been boosted by central bank action to stimulate global economic growth, but hints that this might be coming to an end, along with fears of a credit crunch in China, have led to the recent tumultuous falls. Recent comments from US Federal Reserve members and China's central bank have served to calm some of these fears, but the situation is still fairly volatile. Rebecca O'Keeffe, head of investment at Interactive Investor, said: Markets have stabilised after what has been a fraught few weeks - calmed by comments from both Fed officials and China. With the global liquidity produced by QE and the huge withdrawals we've seen in recent weeks - particularly from bond investors, there is a wall of cash waiting to find the right time to invest. However, we've been here before and whilst it may appear as if all the major macro issues have disappeared, there remain concerns about whether there will be another leg down.

And thus he continues with the usual boiler plate rhetoric such as: \u201cThe solution is not more government, it is less,\u201d and that the budget needs to be \u201crepaired\u201d.</p> <p>The best thing about austerity is its rhetoric. It sounds great: the whole, \u201clive within your means\u201d type of stuff plays really well. The problem is when politicians actually start believing it.&#xa0;</p> <p>Ronald Reagan was one smart enough to know that the key to austerity was the talk, not the action. During his government, which still bizarrely is thought of as a champion of austerity, general government expenditure rose. Moreover, the structural balance of government budget went steeply into deficit before returning to surplus during the good times of the 1990s:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-e30544db-dd2d-46cd-8044-d3a75192654f\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/6/28/1372380481593/f14890ed-0091-491f-aa9a-46d35297dcba-460x253.jpeg\" alt=\"US general government structural budget balance\" width=\"460\" height=\"253\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">US general government structural budget balance</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Hockey explained that any future stimulus would not be like the last one, which, given that it worked, is not all that heartening.</p> <p>He noted: \u201cYou won\u2019t see the Coalition sending $900 cheques to dead people. We will not be spending billions of dollars installing pink batts and then millions more removing them. And we will not be spending billions of taxpayer dollars on overpriced school halls that schools don\u2019t want and which do nothing to raise the standard of education.\u201d</p> <p>These lines have been spouted so long it has gone beyond tiring to correct them. But let\u2019s just note for example that the \u201coverpriced school halls\u201d argument works so long as you don\u2019t read <a href=\"http://deewr.gov.au/ber-implementation-taskforce\">the Orgill report</a> which found that stimulus spend achieved its aims remarkably well. Moreover, the report also provided policymakers with a strong guide for how to ensure even better performance next time.</p> <p>The school halls stimulus was never primarily about improving education standards; it was about keeping construction going. Schools were picked because pretty much every town has one and there would be the additional benefit of providing much needed capital works in many of the schools.</p> <p>And it worked. You only need to look at the growth in public and private construction during the period to see the Building the Education Revolution spend filled a massive gap that stopped construction falling about 10% in 2009:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-d24c9ceb-295f-4e8c-9c82-4e1b5a20df4d\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/6/28/1372380612845/3d473bc5-2995-402c-aaa4-6411bb30e547-460x275.jpeg\" alt=\"Annual growth in construction\" width=\"460\" height=\"275\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Annual growth in construction</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Moreover, the lack of an increase in prices during this period also suggests the government was merely filling the gap left by the private sector, and not competing for labour and resources or \u201ccrowding out\u201d.</p> <p>Those who believe the stimulus didn\u2019t work, generally fall into the camp of \u201cit might have worked in practice but not in theory\u201d crowd. They like to look overseas and ask how the stimulus could have worked when it didn\u2019t work in America or the UK? This is a bit like asking why did the Australian cricket team not do as well as the English team when it also hired a coach from southern Africa?</p> <p>The reality is ours did work, the others didn\u2019t (or mostly didn\u2019t work as well). Instead of bemoaning that, we should perhaps boast about it a bit, because from the mid-1980s right though even our mining boom period, Australia GDP growth followed that of the US and UK quite clearly. Then 2008 and 2009 happened:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-32a66e40-5a6b-4ed1-ba8f-e310ad3c3b95\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/6/28/1372389336749/049d524a-cc4c-4ab2-b4fd-2e45fea71102-460x246.jpeg\" alt=\"Annual GDP growth\" width=\"460\" height=\"246\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Annual GDP growth Photograph: /IMF world economic outlook</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Bizarrely, the desire for austerity remains in vogue in some circles. This week the <a href=\"http://www.bis.org/publ/arpdf/ar2013e.htm\">Bank of International Settlements</a> (sort of the central banks\u2019 central bank) released its annual report, suggesting that governments need to start reducing their debt, <em>and</em> central banks need to start raising interest rates.</p> <p>As <a href=\"http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/06/24/dead-enders-in-dark-suits/?_r=0\">Paul Krugman notes</a>, this is great advice if you\u2019re seeking a global depression.</p> <p>But while it is good that Hockey has acknowledged the need for government stimulus in downturns, it remains to be seen if he thinks austerity and cutbacks are the solution regardless of levels of growth.

And it is heartening to hear him say that during an economic downturn, when lower interest rates, a lower dollar or the normal increase in government spending through welfare payments for example, have not worked, something else needs to be done. His view was that in such a case, \u201cadditional well-considered government action could be appropriate.\u201d This is good news, because it acknowledges reality, but unfortunately he still remains rather fixed to the view of austerity for its own sake. And thus he continues with the usual boiler plate rhetoric such as: \u201cThe solution is not more government, it is less,\u201d and that the budget needs to be \u201crepaired\u201d. The best thing about austerity is its rhetoric. It sounds great: the whole, \u201clive within your means\u201d type of stuff plays really well. The problem is when politicians actually start believing it. Ronald Reagan was one smart enough to know that the key to austerity was the talk, not the action. During his government, which still bizarrely is thought of as a champion of austerity, general government expenditure rose. Moreover, the structural balance of government budget went steeply into deficit before returning to surplus during the good times of the 1990s: Hockey explained that any future stimulus would not be like the last one, which, given that it worked, is not all that heartening. He noted: \u201cYou won\u2019t see the Coalition sending $900 cheques to dead people. We will not be spending billions of dollars installing pink batts and then millions more removing them. And we will not be spending billions of taxpayer dollars on overpriced school halls that schools don\u2019t want and which do nothing to raise the standard of education.\u201d These lines have been spouted so long it has gone beyond tiring to correct them. But let\u2019s just note for example that the \u201coverpriced school halls\u201d argument works so long as you don\u2019t read the Orgill report which found that stimulus spend achieved its aims remarkably well. Moreover, the report also provided policymakers with a strong guide for how to ensure even better performance next time. The school halls stimulus was never primarily about improving education standards; it was about keeping construction going. Schools were picked because pretty much every town has one and there would be the additional benefit of providing much needed capital works in many of the schools. And it worked. You only need to look at the growth in public and private construction during the period to see the Building the Education Revolution spend filled a massive gap that stopped construction falling about 10% in 2009: Moreover, the lack of an increase in prices during this period also suggests the government was merely filling the gap left by the private sector, and not competing for labour and resources or \u201ccrowding out\u201d. Those who believe the stimulus didn\u2019t work, generally fall into the camp of \u201cit might have worked in practice but not in theory\u201d crowd. They like to look overseas and ask how the stimulus could have worked when it didn\u2019t work in America or the UK? This is a bit like asking why did the Australian cricket team not do as well as the English team when it also hired a coach from southern Africa? The reality is ours did work, the others didn\u2019t (or mostly didn\u2019t work as well). Instead of bemoaning that, we should perhaps boast about it a bit, because from the mid-1980s right though even our mining boom period, Australia GDP growth followed that of the US and UK quite clearly. Then 2008 and 2009 happened: Bizarrely, the desire for austerity remains in vogue in some circles. This week the Bank of International Settlements (sort of the central banks\u2019 central bank) released its annual report, suggesting that governments need to start reducing their debt, and central banks need to start raising interest rates. As Paul Krugman notes, this is great advice if you\u2019re seeking a global depression. But while it is good that Hockey has acknowledged the need for government stimulus in downturns, it remains to be seen if he thinks austerity and cutbacks are the solution regardless of levels of growth. The rhetoric of austerity always sounds sweet; the practise is rather more cacophonic.",
