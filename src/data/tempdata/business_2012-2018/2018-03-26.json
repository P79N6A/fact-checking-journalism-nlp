      "bodyText": "The Chinese company behind House of Fraser will inject about \u00a315m into the department store chain this week as part of a plan to allay concerns about the 169-year-old firm\u2019s financial health. The retailer, which employs 6,000, has been under the spotlight over fears it could become the next victim of torrid trading conditions for the UK retail sector that have already claimed well-known high street names such as Toys R Us and Maplin this year. It is trying to slash the floorspace of its 59-strong store chain by 30% and reduce its rent bill after dismal Christmas trading figures, while its bank lenders have hired accountancy EY to review the firm\u2019s finances. The chain has also held talks with Alteri \u2013 a turnaround firm that specialises in struggling retailers \u2013 fuelling speculation that is looking to refinance its \u00a3400m debts. House of Fraser has since protested that it only agreed to a meeting at Alteri\u2019s request and could not have sought fresh finance in any case, given the terms of its existing loans. The picture has been further complicated by suggestions that China\u2019s Sanpower, which owns 89% of the company, is seeking to offload the majority of its stake to fellow Chinese leisure firm Wuji Wenhua. But the Guardian understands that Sanpower, which bought House of Fraser in 2014 in a deal worth \u00a3450m, will reaffirm its commitment to the business, starting with an expected \u00a315m cash injection as soon as this week. The Sanpower chairman, Yuan Yafei, reassured the trade minister, Liam Fox, that he wants to own House of Fraser for the long term, in a discussion last Friday at Hong Kong\u2019s Great Festival of Innovation. The entrepreneur, who started his business in 1993 with $2,000 (\u00a31,415) and is now worth an estimated $12bn, is thought to have promised further investment, coupled with a wider overhaul and modernisation of the company and House of Fraser brand. A spokesperson for Sanpower confirmed that Yafei will inject more money into House of Fraser via Nanjing Cenbest, Sanpower\u2019s Shanghai-listed subsidiary. \u201cWe at Sanpower continue to support House of Fraser as it embarks on a year of significant transformation in 2018,\u201d he said. \u201cSanpower, through the listed company, has invested \u00a345m in House of Fraser and plans to inject further capital.\u201d With the money on its way, the chief executive, Alex Williamson, wrote to House of Fraser\u2019s suppliers on Monday to say that the company was continuing with business as usual. The long-term puzzle for Sanpower is that business as usual is not exactly a high bar, at least not lately. After buying House of Fraser four years ago, Yafei laid out ambitious plans to create an international retailer with 50 Chinese stores. Today it has just two Chinese outlets, while its main UK operation is feeling the pinch from flagging revenues and cripplingly high costs. \u201cThey\u2019ve got too much space, inflexible leases, upward-only rent reviews and are also facing pressure from the national living wage,\u201d said Richard Lim, the chief executive of Retail Economics. \u201cIt\u2019s all putting significant cost pressures on operating their stores, so operating costs are up 3% year on year, which outstrips the sales rise.\u201d Lim said rising costs had been accompanied by weak consumer spending as real wages have stagnated or fallen, due to the rise in inflation sparked by the fall in the value of the pound after the Brexit vote. \u201cOne of the biggest issues around inflation is that it\u2019s mainly coming from food, transport and housing costs,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you take those three components, that takes up about 50% of the least affluent households\u2019 expenditure and it\u2019s non-discretionary. \u201cPeople are worried about Brexit, about personal finances, about job security, so they\u2019re holding back on purchasing non-essential items.\u201d One way retailers have stripped out costs is to migrate sales to the web, where overheads are far lower. But House of Fraser has struggled to wean itself off traditional bricks-and-mortar stores, largely because it is saddled with expensive and lengthy leases signed decades ago, when it seemed large retailers could never have too much floorspace. The business is now asking its landlords for help to reduce its \u00a3140m-a-year rent bill. David Fox, the head of retail agency at real estate group Colliers, said: \u201cWhen you have surplus space that still costs you money it\u2019s just a drain on resources. \u201cI\u2019m guessing they\u2019ll be exploring options to release space and come up with an economic answer.\u201d He said House of Fraser could look to bring in other businesses to help share the cost of floorspace, pointing to steps taken by struggling rival Debenhams, which has rented space to gyms and a hot-desking firm. But Fox warned that if landlords could not find tenants willing to match the generous rents House of Fraser is paying, the chain will have to make up the difference. Lim pointed to House of Fraser\u2019s difficulties in relaunching its website as another factor in its recent poor performance. He said the issues were behind poor Christmas sales figures, when store sales were down 2.9% but online revenues plunged 7.5%. \u201cWe estimate online is about 18% of total retail spending and they\u2019ve had quite a lot of difficulty in implementing a new online platform last year. They invested a lot of money but it didn\u2019t go very well and there were lots of problems with it.\u201d House of Fraser\u2019s website woes are thought to have been ironed out now but pressure on margins remains, prompting the company to sell \u00a330m of brands, identify \u00a316m in cost savings and invest \u00a310m in more up-to-date warehouse technology. From Scotland to Chinese ownership The department store group dates back to 1849, when Hugh Fraser and James Arthur opened a drapery shop, called Arthur &amp; Fraser, on the corner of Argyle Street and Buchanan Street in Glasgow. In 1909 the company, now Fraser &amp; Sons, started using the stag\u2019s head logo. The firm went on to acquire more than 70 companies, including Harrods and shoe retailer Kurt Geiger. Renamed House of Fraser, the firm made its first appearance on the London Stock Exchange in 1948. A takeover bid by Tiny Rowland\u2019s conglomerate Lonrho was blocked by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission in 1981. HoF was bought by the Al-Fayed family for \u00a3615m in 1985, and its stag\u2019s head logo was replaced by a stag leaping from a triangle. In 1994, it floated on the London Stock Exchange with a market value of \u00a3484m. A major store refurbishment and closure programme followed with the loss of 1,000 staff. HoF went on to launch its house brands including womenswear, menswear, and homeware by Linea. In 2006, the company was taken private again in a \u00a3351m deal by a consortium led by Icelandic investor Baugur, which collapsed three years later. Baugur\u2019s stake passed to the administrators to failed Icelandic bank Landsbanki, with the HoF chairman, Don McCarthy owning a further 20%. In 2014, HoF was sold to Chinese conglomerate Sanpower for \u00a3480m, despite efforts by Sports Direct owner Mike Ashley, who had acquired a sizeable stake, to derail the deal. HoF\u2019s owner could change again \u2013 Sanpower is in talks to sell a 51% stake to Chinese tourism firm Wuji Wenhua. Additional reporting by Julia Kollewe",

    "webTitle": "Harry Goodman obituary", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Harry Goodman made the American dream a reality for thousands of British people by selling two-week holidays to Miami Beach for \u00a3199 when the air fare alone was usually much more than that. He also created a pan-European low-cost airline, Air Europe, before Ryanair and easyJet became household names. I first met Harry, who has died aged 79, in the mid-1970s while a reporter for Travel Trade Gazette. His company, Intasun (later International Leisure Group), was starting its rapid rise to challenge Thomson Holidays, the UK\u2019s biggest tour operator, and like many observers I thought he was brash, flashy and possibly heading for a fall. By the time ILG went bust in 1991 he was one of the most recognisable names in British business, but his raucous private life had made him a target for tabloid expos\u00e9s. He embraced a playboy lifestyle to the full with a Rolls Royce convertible, private yacht and private jet, but along with that came drugs and wild parties where he surrounded himself with pretty girls. The collapse of ILG was not the end of his career in travel, and when I contacted him again in 2015 as I researched my book Let\u2019s Go: A History of Package Holidays and Escorted Tours, he was a very different man \u2013 humble, reflective and very appreciative of all the opportunities life had given him. Harry\u2019s rise to industry leader, tabloid character and donor to charity was all the more remarkable considering that he was born into poverty in the East End of London, orphaned at 13 and left school at 16 to work in a travel agency. He was the son of Rebecca Aaronovitch, from a Latvian Jewish immigrant family, but he did not know his father, who died before he was born. His mother married Charles Goodman, with Harry taking that name when he was adopted. The couple had two more boys, but when Charles abandoned the family and Rebecca died, Harry went to live with uncles while the younger boys went to an orphanage. He never forgot his origins and charities in the East End were to benefit as he became wealthy. When Harry set up his first tour company, Sunair, in the early 60s, package holidays were in their infancy. He described the business as \u201ccowboy country, like the beginning of a gold rush\u201d, with little regulation but plenty of customers keen to discover the newly developed beach resorts of Spain and Italy. He sold holidays door to door while the first of the big, cheap package holiday companies, Clarksons, grew rapidly. The Thomson Organisation of Canada had set up Thomson Holidays in competition, but Sunair remained small and had been taken over and closed down by 1972. The following year Harry set up a lookalike company called Intasun, and when Clarksons went bust in 1974 he had a team of people ready to contract Clarksons hotel rooms for as little as \u00a31 per person per day, including breakfast and dinner. The battle for supremacy between Thomson and Intasun dominated the travel industry for 17 years \u2013 Thomson being corporate, well-managed but sometimes slow to act, with Intasun, in Harry\u2019s own words, \u201clike a Jack Russell snapping at a big dog\u2019s heels\u201d. In 1979, a milestone year, Intasun set up a charter airline, Air Europe, and announced bargain holidays to the US using planes chartered from Laker Airways. Harry was flamboyant, extrovert and impulsive, but brought in expertise from other companies to help run Intasun. Not even his closest confidantes knew what he was planning in Florida, but the first season\u2019s holidays to Miami Beach sold out so quickly that the volume of calls put the telephone exchange in Bromley, Kent, where Intasun was based, out of action. That success made Intasun very profitable, and it was floated on the stock exchange in 1981. By 1985 it had acquired several other tour operators and was renamed International Leisure Group, but this rapid growth was taking its toll on Harry, who had become addicted to cocaine, receiving a conviction for possession in 1981. The following year, while in rehab, he bought the beach party tour operator Club 18-30. The battle with Thomson raged on as both companies put millions more holidays on sale, with prices slashed. ILG was brought back into private hands and Harry became chief barker of the Variety Club of Great Britain, his charity work bringing him into contact with royalty and the then prime minister, Margaret Thatcher. But he was looking beyond package holidays, and Air Europe became a scheduled as well as a charter airline in 1988. It flew to destinations such as Paris, Rome \u2013 where VIPs on the first flight were greeted by Pope John Paul II \u2013 and Munich, in competition with British Airways before the deregulation of air travel in the EU in 1993 created a free for all. He also found partners to set up Air Europe in several other European countries. The airline, though, proved to be ILG\u2019s downfall. The Gulf war of 1990-91 devastated travel as Saddam Hussein threatened to shoot down western planes, and hit Air Europe particularly hard. The group collapsed a few days after the war ended, owing \u00a3500m, though industry safeguards meant that no package holiday customer lost any money. Harry returned to travel in 1998 with TV Travel Shop, selling holidays through cable TV, making more money when it was sold to venture capitalists in 2002. His final venture, 1st4cruising and its holding company Totally Travel, ended in failure in 2012. \u201cIf you play to win, don\u2019t be surprised if you lose,\u201d he once told me. \u201cI came from the slums to meeting royalty and I\u2019m grateful, not bitter.\u201d Harry is survived by his third wife, Yvonne, whom he married in 1986; Debra and Jonathan, the children from his first marriage, to Helen Ross, which ended in divorce; and his daughter Naomi, from his second marriage, to Joy Rosendale, which also ended in divorce. \u2022 Harry Goodman, tour and airline operator, born 12 November 1938; died 12 March 2018",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The US markets have made a bright start after last week\u2019s rout following news that the US planned to impose $60bn of tariffs on Chinese imports. Investors have turned slightly more positive on hopes that the US and China could resolve the row before it turned into a full blown trade war, following positive comments over the weekend from US treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin. S&amp;P said we were not in a trade war yet but much would depend on China\u2019s plans for retaliation to the $60bn worth of sanctions announced by Donald Trump last week. So on Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 430 points or 1.83% higher, while the S&amp;P 500 has climbed 1.6% and the Nasdaq Composite is up 1.98%. In Europe Germany\u2019s Dax is 0.4% better while France\u2019s Cac has climbed 0.34%. The FTSE 100 had added 0.3%. Earlier there was better than expected growth from the French economy but in the UK, mortgage approvals showed an 11% month on month fall in February. Elsewhere IMF managing director Christine Lagarde said the eurozone should set up a rainy day fund to cope with any future financial difficulties member states might get into. On the corporate front, UK retailer JD Sports stepped into the US market, while packaging group Smurfit Kappa rejected an increased bid from rival International Paper. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Ahead of the US market open, a positive bit of economic data. The Chicago Fed\u2019s national activity index has jumped from +0.02 in January to +0.88 in February. January\u2019s figure was however revised down from +0.12. Speaking of Brexit, Moody\u2019s Investors Service says the agreement between the UK and the EU on the terms of a transition arrangement is positive but there is still much uncertainty. In a report just published, it said: The agreement provides clarity that is credit positive for a broad range of UK issuers because it extends the narrow time frame that is available to shape and implement a new trade agreement and regulatory regimes with the EU until existing common rules cease to apply. It also buys the UK limited time to negotiate free trade agreements (FTAs) with other countries. However, the agreement remains conditional on the UK and the EU overcoming other challenges, such as the need to find a solution that prevents the creation of a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. Until a conclusive final agreement is reached, uncertainty over the terms of the UK\u2019s future long-term relationship with the EU will persist, weighing on the operating environment for UK issuers and hampering corporate investment With a year to go until Britain leaves the European Union, there are a host of unresolved issues facing business. Dan Roberts has been taking a look: In the currency markets, the pound is edging higher against both the dollar and euro. Against the dollar it is up 0.6% at $1.4223 while against the euro it is up 0.17% at \u20ac1.1458. The single currency is also benefiting from dollar weakness. All this is helping limit the gains in European stock markets, says Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets: Equities have started the week on the front foot, with reports of US-China talks helping ease the trade war fears which pushed equities lower last week, as well as Trump signing rather than vetoing a US government spending bill. That said, US dollar weakness, and thus pound and euro strength, is keeping equity bullishness in check, holding indices from breaking back above key levels, to inspire confidence in a turnaround. Europe should create a rainy day fund to help any countries that get into financial difficulties in the future, said IMF managing director Christine Lagarde. In a speech in Berlin she said: [A new IMF paper] proposes creating a \u201crainy-day fund\u201d that countries contribute to each year to build up assets in good times. Then, depending on the depth of a downturn countries would receive transfers to help them offset budget shortfalls. In extreme circumstances, the fund would be allowed to borrow, however any borrowing would be repaid by members\u2019 future contributions. By itself, the capacity may not be enough to solve the next crisis \u2014 but it certainly would help. Eurozone officials have been considering such a fund since last year, with France in particular backing the idea. European markets are managing to hold onto their early gains. The FTSE 100 is currently up 0.4%, Germany\u2019s Dax is 0.5% higher and France\u2019s Cac has climbed 0.24%. On Wall Street, the futures are suggesting the Dow Jones Industrial Average will open more than 300 points higher. Here\u2019s the latest update from the receivers at collapsed construction giant Carillion. Another 123 employees have lost their jobs and will leave the business later this week. But 481 jobs have been saved, with the staff transferring to new suppliers. That means so far 9,073 employees have now found secure ongoing employment, said the receivers, while 1,705 jobs have been axed. They added: More than 6,400 employees are currently retained to enable Carillion to deliver the remaining services it is providing for public and private sector customers until decisions are taken to transfer or cease these contracts. Talks to sell the remaining businesses are still going on, said a spokesperson for the receivers: Discussions with potential purchasers continue. I am continuing to engage with staff, elected employee representatives and unions to keep them informed as these arrangements are confirmed. Back in the corporate world, and excitement in the paper and packaging realm. Ireland\u2019s Smurfit Kappa has seen its shares drop by nearly 4%, making it the biggest faller in the FTSE 100, after it rejected an increased \u20ac9.5bn offer from US rival International Paper. Smurfit said the offer undervalued its business and made no strategic sense. Its chairman Liam O\u2019Mahony said: The revised proposal does not offer Smurfit Kappa shareholders much more than compensation for the fall in International Paper\u2019s share price since [the first offer] and again entirely fails to value the group\u2019s true intrinsic business worth and future prospects. Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, said: Today\u2019s [share price] reaction suggests concern among Smurfit holders (sitting on still handsome 20% profits versus 2018\u2019s average) that IP\u2019s new 15% higher cash component is merely aimed at offsetting the now lower valued share component, and that the meagre 3% boost to the aggregate offer means it is unprepared to go much if any higher. The other worry is that Smurfit will continue to hold out for improved terms which may never materialise. In which case, shareholders are cashing out as close to the top as they can. Those hanging on may be expecting a second revision from IP before it gives up. And history tells us this could well happen. The second bid does, after all, show willingness to maintain the bid\u2019s 67% cash value to Smurfit shareholders. However, given Smurfit\u2019s second rejection, and unless any third offer is for something closer to recent record highs (10% higher), it may not prove enough to convince management and shareholders alike to agree to tender. Especially given the risk that the value of the 32% share component worsens further, assuming the deal requires at least some anti-trust approval. Apart from the hopes that the US and China can avert an all out trade war, markets have also been buoyed by news that South Korea has been granted an indefinite exemption from steel and aluminium tariffs. The US has already given the European Union a temporary extension, something the bloc is hoping to make permanent. But if the US and China cannot resolve their differences, investors are likely to take fright once more. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: It is a calm morning after the stormy atmosphere of last week. US futures have raced higher on weekend reports that the US and China are working towards a possible deal that improves access for US firms. With equity markets so heavily beaten down last week, a rebound was a definite possibility, the only questions are how long it lasts and how far it goes. Churchill\u2019s observation that \u2018to jaw jaw is better than to war war\u2019 applies to these tariff battles as well. The decision to exempt key US allies from the tariffs is a sign that the White House is not as dogmatic as the rhetoric appears, and should give negotiators room for manoeuvre. Still, given how badly equities reacted last week a failure of negotiations would likely prompt another ugly sell-off. A new snapshot of the UK housing market shows mortage approvals fell by 11% in February to 38,120 compared to January, but were up 4.9% on a year ago. But according to UK Finance, net mortgage lending rose by \u00a31.643bn compared to \u00a31.038bn in January. Credit card borrowing grew by 6.3% compared to a year ago. Eric Leenders, managing director of personal finance at UK Finance said: There has been an increase in remortgage approvals compared to last year, as borrowers look to lock in to attractive deals amid speculation of further interest rate rises later this year. We are also seeing a continuing rise in credit card spending, reflecting the growing number of transactions carried out using cards, while other forms of borrowing such as overdrafts continue to fall. Meanwhile real wages continue to be squeezed by inflation, impacting on consumer confidence and retail sales. This pressure on household incomes should ease in the coming months, as the effect of the fall in sterling begins to fade and the strong labour market leads to a better outlook for wage growth. Despite the US tariffs to be imposed on Chinese products, we are not in a trade war - yet. That\u2019s the view of S&amp;P Global Ratings: President Trump\u2019s long-threatened package of trade sanctions on China has landed, but a trade war isn\u2019t yet inevitable. In general, the threatened tariffs and investment restrictions on China won\u2019t likely cause deep pain to the Chinese economy, nor will they have a material impact on corporate borrowers in either country. However, S&amp;P Global Ratings believes China\u2019s response will be the key determinant on what happens next. So far China\u2019s response has been relatively measured, indicating potential tariffs on about $3 billion of U.S. imports. But will China take additional retaliatory action? \u201cMore aggressive moves could escalate into a full-blown trade war between the world\u2019s two largest economies--with spillover effects on global business confidence, investment, and growth,\u201d said managing director Terry Chan.... Preliminary analysis shows that the overall impact on Chinese corporates and banks will be contained because the US represents only about 15% of China\u2019s exports, and China\u2019s domestic activity now drives its economic growth rather than exports. The $50 billion-$60 billion targeted by potential tariffs could affect up to 10%-12% of Chinese imports to the US. The trade dispute appears to be about technology and intellectual property, so products subject to the tariffs could include computers and cell phones. However, it\u2019s unclear whether the tariffs will focus on just one or two product categories or be more widespread. \u201cThe near-term effects on corporate credit will likely be muted--barring an immediate escalation of retaliatory measures--but there will still be some impact for certain sectors, depending on their reliance on the Chinese market,\u201d said managing director of corporate ratings David Tesher. However, our base case for limited ratings impact doesn\u2019t factor in a Sino-US trade war. China has so far flagged that it may impose tariffs on 128 US product imports, including pork, recyclable aluminum, fruit/nuts, wine, and steel pipes. However, these products represent a relatively modest portion of trade from the US. If China\u2019s response is more retaliatory, we would re-analyze the impact on industry sectors in both countries. Back in the corporate world, and the US has proved a step too far for many UK retailers, even such big names as Marks &amp; Spencer and Tesco. Still, this has not stopped highly rated JD Sports from taking the plunge. Reuters has the details: British sports and fashion retailer JD Sports Fashion said on Monday it has agreed to buy US firm The Finish Line for $558m (\u00a3396m), boosting its presence in the world\u2019s largest sportswear market. JD Sports has exploited growing demand for branded sports shoes and clothes to overtake Sports Direct as Britain\u2019s leading sportswear retailer by market value and in recent years has also been expanding overseas. It said it has agreed to pay $13.50 per share for Finish Line, one of the largest retailers of premium multi-branded athletic footwear, apparel and accessories in the US. The firm trades from 556 Finish Line branded retail stores across 44 U.S. states and Puerto Rico and also has an online presence. Finish Line is also the exclusive retailer of athletic shoes, both in-store and online, for Macy\u2019s, operating 375 branded and 188 unbranded concessions within Macy\u2019s stores. \u201cThe acquisition offers the company the opportunity to expand its market leading elevated proposition into the most significant global market,\u201d JD said. \u201cIt immediately gains the benefit of a significant physical and online retail presence and increases the importance of the company to its major international brand partners.\u201d JD Sports said it would fund the deal through a new revolving credit facility and a new asset backed lending facility secured against Finish Line\u2019s inventory and receivables. It forecast the acquisition would make a small incremental positive contribution to its results and earnings per share in the year to Feb. 2 2019. Despite the moves higher in Europe, markets remain edgy, says Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM: US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin commented over the weekend that he is cautiously optimistic that an agreement would be reached between the U.S. and China, and this would likely calm the markets when the U.S. trading session kicks off. However, the longer the \u201cwait and see\u201d mode lasts, the more pressure will be felt in the equities market. After all, many companies will need to adjust their expansion and capital spending plans according to the new developments. This will certainly impact investor\u2019s confidence and risk global economic growth, which has been the key pillar of the nine-year-old bull run. Positive signs from the French economy are also giving some support to European markets. The country\u2019s GDP grew by 0.7% in the fourth quarter compared to the previous three months, better than the 0.6% originally estimated. The estimate for 2017 as a whole remained at 2%, according to the INSEE statistics agency. It\u2019s a nervy start to trading in Europe, but markets have managed to edge higher despite the continuing tariff tensions. Investors are hoping the suggestion that the US and China are in discussions behind the scenes might avoid a full blown trade war between the two. So the FTSE 100 is up 0.21%, Germany\u2019s Dax has added 0.3% and Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB is 0.29% better. In Asia there has been a turnaround from early losses, with the Hang Seng 0.13% higher while the Nikkei 225 is now up 0.72%. The US futures are suggesting a gain of more than 200 points on the Dow Jones Industrial Average at the open, although this would mean it recovers only half the losses experienced on Friday. Uber has announced a deal to regroup its operations in south-east Asia: Ride-hailing firm Uber has agreed to sell its south-east Asian business to bigger regional rival Grab, marking the US company\u2019s second retreat from an Asian market. The deal is the industry\u2019s first big consolidation in south-east Asia, home to about 640 million people, and puts pressure on Indonesia\u2019s Go-Jek, which is backed by Alphabet\u2019s Google and China\u2019s Tencent. A shake-up in Asia\u2019s fiercely competitive ride-hailing industry became likely earlier this year when Japan-based SoftBank\u2019s Vision Fund made a multi-billion dollar investment in Uber. SoftBank also invested in Grab. As part of the transaction, Uber will take a 27.5% stake in Singapore-based Grab and Uber\u2019s CEO, Dara Khosrowshahi, will join Grab\u2019s board. Here\u2019s the full report: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Donald Trump\u2019s plans to impose $60bn worth of tariffs on China - on top of wider sanctions on steel and aluminium - raised fears of a trade war between the world\u2019s two largest economies and sent shivers through global stock markets. Those tensions are not going away quickly, and despite signs that China and the US may be attempting to resolve the issue behind the scenes, investors remain nervous. After Wall Street endured another tough day on Friday in the wake of the tariff announcements - the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped another 424 points or 1.77% - Asian markets have also been under pressure. Here is our latest report: So European markets are expected to open in a rather mixed fashion: Michael Hewson at CMC Markets UK said: As we come to the end of this first quarter of 2018 all of the optimism that we saw at the end of January now appears to be an almost distant memory, and it will need a significant change of tone to prevent stock markets finishing this quarter lower, despite this year\u2019s record highs. China\u2019s initially measured response to last week\u2019s announcement of tariffs to the US administrations announcement does appear to offer some hope in terms of a possible stabilisation this week, but sentiment is likely to remain volatile, particularly if Chinese authorities follow up with further large scale measures which target, larger US corporations like Boeing or Apple. US treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin\u2019s comments at the weekend that he was cautiously optimistic that a US agreement with China could be reached also offers hope that some form of accommodation can be reached in the coming days or weeks. At the beginning of the month President Trump indicated that he would implement tariffs in a \u201cloving way\u201d, maybe in an attempt to suggest that he didn\u2019t want to spook equity investors. If recent price action is any guide markets are clearly not \u201cloving\u201d what is happening right now, which is also being exacerbated by rising concerns that the tech sector, which has driven most of the gains in US equity markets, could be on the cusp of being clobbered by increasing regulation, as well as possible taxation changes. On a pretty quiet day for corporate and economic news, GKN continues to try and persuade its shareholders to back its management rather than be tempted by the \u00a37.8bn offer from turnaround specialist Melrose. Investors have until Thursday this week to decide, and ahead of that GKN has just announced an improvement in the terms of its deal to merge its Driveline business with US group Dana. Dana has added another $140m (\u00a3100m) in cash, making a total of $1.77bn in cash after deducting $1bn for the transfer of the pension deficit to the combined group. GKN plans to return \u00a3700m to shareholders as soon as possible after the Dana deal is down, the first part of a \u00a32.5bn cash return programme.

Its chairman Liam O\u2019Mahony said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The revised proposal does not offer Smurfit Kappa shareholders much more than compensation for the fall in International Paper\u2019s share price since [the first offer] and again entirely fails to value the group\u2019s true intrinsic business worth and future prospects. </p> </blockquote> <p>Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, said:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Today\u2019s [share price] reaction suggests concern among Smurfit holders (sitting on still handsome 20% profits versus 2018\u2019s average) that IP\u2019s new 15% higher cash component is merely aimed at offsetting the now lower valued share component, and that the meagre 3% boost to the aggregate offer means it is unprepared to go much if any higher. The other worry is that Smurfit will continue to hold out for improved terms which may never materialise. In which case, shareholders are cashing out as close to the top as they can.</p> <p>Those hanging on may be expecting a second revision from IP before it gives up. And history tells us this could well happen. The second bid does, after all, show willingness to maintain the bid\u2019s 67% cash value to Smurfit shareholders. However, given Smurfit\u2019s second rejection, and unless any third offer is for something closer to recent record highs (10% higher), it may not prove enough to convince management and shareholders alike to agree to tender. Especially given the risk that the value of the 32% share component worsens further, assuming the deal requires at least some anti-trust approval.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"521299dad29829431f496585fdc4559260155639\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/521299dad29829431f496585fdc4559260155639/0_30_3308_1985/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Water vapour billows from smokestacks at the Smurfit Kappa Cellulose du Pin plant in Facture, southwestern France.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Water vapour billows from smokestacks at the Smurfit Kappa Cellulose du Pin plant in Facture, southwestern France.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Regis Duvignau/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2018-03-26T09:56:04.184Z\">at 10.56am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5ab8ba17e4b034ce54aa95b5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-03-26T09:19:52.963Z\">10.19am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Apart from the hopes that the US and China can avert an all out trade war, markets have also been buoyed by news that <a href=\"https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-southkorea-trade-usa/u-s-south-korea-revise-trade-deal-korean-steel-faces-quota-idUKKBN1H206N\">South Korea has been granted an indefinite exemption from steel and aluminium tariffs</a>.</p> <p>The US has already given the European Union a temporary extension, something the bloc is hoping to make permanent.</p> <p>But if the US and China cannot resolve their differences, investors are likely to take fright once more.

That\u2019s the view of S&amp;P Global Ratings:</p> <blockquote> <p>President Trump\u2019s long-threatened package of trade sanctions on China has landed, but a trade war isn\u2019t yet inevitable. In general, the threatened tariffs and investment restrictions on China won\u2019t likely cause deep pain to the Chinese economy, nor will they have a material impact on corporate borrowers in either country.</p> <p>However, S&amp;P Global Ratings believes China\u2019s response will be the key determinant on what happens next. So far China\u2019s response has been relatively measured, indicating potential tariffs on about $3 billion of U.S. imports. But will China take additional retaliatory action?</p> <p>\u201cMore aggressive moves could escalate into a full-blown trade war between the world\u2019s two largest economies--with spillover effects on global business confidence, investment, and growth,\u201d said managing director Terry Chan....</p> <p>Preliminary analysis shows that the overall impact on Chinese corporates and banks will be contained because the US represents only about 15% of China\u2019s exports, and China\u2019s domestic activity now drives its economic growth rather than exports. The $50 billion-$60 billion targeted by potential tariffs could affect up to 10%-12% of Chinese imports to the US.</p> <p>The trade dispute appears to be about technology and intellectual property, so products subject to the tariffs could include computers and cell phones. However, it\u2019s unclear whether the tariffs will focus on just one or two product categories or be more widespread.</p> <p>\u201cThe near-term effects on corporate credit will likely be muted--barring an immediate escalation of retaliatory measures--but there will still be some impact for certain sectors, depending on their reliance on the Chinese market,\u201d said managing director of corporate ratings David Tesher. However, our base case for limited ratings impact doesn\u2019t factor in a Sino-US trade war. China has so far flagged that it may impose tariffs on 128 US product imports, including pork, recyclable aluminum, fruit/nuts, wine, and steel pipes. However, these products represent a relatively modest portion of trade from the US. If China\u2019s response is more retaliatory, we would re-analyze the impact on industry sectors in both countries.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5ab8a4fde4b01a4d38bab087\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-03-26T07:52:02.502Z\">8.52am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">JD Sports steps into US footwear market</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Back in the corporate world, and the US has proved a step too far for many UK retailers, even such big names as Marks &amp; Spencer and Tesco.

      "bodyText": "The courier company DPD is to offer all of its drivers sick and holiday pay and will abolish its controversial \u00a3150 daily fines for missing work, as part of wholesale reforms to its gig-working model sparked by the death of a driver it charged for attending a medical appointment to treat his diabetes and who later collapsed. The announcement came six weeks after the Guardian exposed the case of Don Lane, who was delivering parcels for the company on behalf or retailers including Marks &amp; Spencer and John Lewis. The retailers raised concerns with the company over how it was treating couriers. Lane\u2019s treatment caused anger in Westminster, with Labour describing it as \u201cheartbreaking\u201d and the business secretary, Greg Clark, labelling it \u201ca terrible tragedy\u201d. DPD said on Monday it would offer its 6,000 couriers the right to be classed as eitherworkers, an interim status that includes paid holiday, sick pay and access to a pension scheme with the possibility to still be paid per delivery, as a fully-fledged employee or to remain a self-employed franchisee. At present more than 5,000 of the drivers are self-employed and are paid per delivery but enjoy no employment rights. Drivers who choose direct employment will be paid less per parcel delivered to offset the cost of paid holiday, sick pay and pensions. Lane, 53, from Christchurch in Dorset, missed three appointments with specialists to treat kidney damage from his diabetes because he felt under pressure to cover his round and faced DPD\u2019s \u00a3150 daily penalties if he did not find cover, his widow told the Guardian. He collapsed at the wheel of his van while on deliveries a few months before he died in January. Responding to DPD\u2019s announcement on Monday, Lane\u2019s widow, Ruth, said: \u201cIt would have been lovely if it had been sooner. This won\u2019t bring Don back. If this had happened a few years back I might not have lost him.\u201d Dwain McDonald, chief executive of the company, which made \u00a3100m in profits last year, said: \u201cWe recognise that we need to improve the way we work with our drivers. While the self-employed franchise scheme has benefited thousands of drivers over the past 20 years, it hasn\u2019t moved with the times and needs updating. Our plan is to completely transform our overall driver offer, as well as the day-to-day working relationship we have with our drivers.\u201d DPD is one of several courier companies that rely on armies of self-employed drivers. Others include Hermes, UK Mail and Yodel. It is the first to propose such fundamental reforms amid growing concern at the instability caused by the spread of the gig economy model in the UK, under which an estimated 1.1 million people are employed. The Labour MP Frank Field, chair of the Commons select committee on work and pensions, said: \u201cIt is awful that it took the death of Don Lane to prompt DPD to make this move. But having now responded in this way, the company has set a totally new direction for every other company in the gig economy to follow. Banish worker exploitation from these shores, and halt the race to the bottom by both getting rid of punitive fines against sick workers and offering basic protections such as the national living wage, sick pay and holiday pay. \u201cThe risks and rewards being generated by the gig economy must be shared more fairly between companies and their workers, many of whom comprise the vulnerable human underbelly of the labour market. The elimination of bogus self-employment, as DPD seems to be undertaking with these reforms, will have a key role to play in that rebalancing.\u201d DPD appointed David Watts, the former chair of the parliamentary Labour party, and Iain Wright, the former chair of the House of Commons business, energy and industrial strategy select committee, as external advisers on the reforms. Thirty-six DPD drivers in Scotland have so far filed grievance cases, claiming they are owed annual leave from when they started delivering for the company, according to the GMB trade union. \u201cWe have to wait and see what the pay rates will be before we decide whether this is a good deal,\u201d said Cal Waterson, the regional organiser for GMB in Scotland. The changes are expected to be introduced in July as part of a new driver code.",

      "bodyText": "The UK\u2019s big six energy companies have been warned that they face going out of business if they drag their heels on the nationwide switch to smart meters. While large energy suppliers publicly support the \u00a311bn government scheme to offer the meters to every home and business by the end of 2020, some are installing them slowly and privately complain of the cost. Sacha Deshmukh, the chief executive of Smart Energy GB, the body behind the Gaz and Leccy adverts, said energy firms must change to survive. \u201cSome legacy companies, of the old large six, have really embraced the fact that the only choice they have for the long term is to embrace this. You can either embrace this or fight it and find your business will be gone in less than five years,\u201d he said. Deshmukh said that the meters would help lower barriers to entry in the energy market and give consumers more choice. Companies such as Tesco and Sky would soon offer energy as part of a bundle of services, he predicted. \u201cAlmost anyone who\u2019s in any retail market will have energy as part of their package.\u201d In an interview with the Guardian, Deshmukh admitted the programme had been delayed but disagreed with Lord Teverson\u2019s warning that ministers are \u201cliving in la la land\u201d about hitting the 2020 deadline. \u201cYes it\u2019s been delayed. Now we\u2019re getting back on track,\u201d he said. The causes of those delays \u2013 establishing the national communications infrastructure for the meters \u2013 were now in the past, he claimed. More than 8m meters have been fitted in homes, and new installations are currently running at 13,000 a day or 400,000 a month. Consumer group Which? has calculated that installers will need to fit 24 meters a minute, 24 hours a day, every day, to meet the 2020 goal. Deshmukh said the installations would peak at 1.2m per month, but would not be drawn on when the industry would reach that rate. He also insisted there are enough installers to fit them all. Unions have raised this as a concern. The first-generation meters that account for almost all the installations so far have also come under fire for going \u201cdumb\u201d after customers switch supplier, a problem which industry chiefs say has tarnished the scheme. But Deshmukh said such interoperability issues were limited, and he was confident they would be fixed by an upgrade this autumn. He also defended the government extending a deadline for fitting the older meters, saying it was \u201cimportant to keep the pace going\u201d. The government\u2019s spending watchdog is reviewing the economic case for and rollout of smart meters. Smart Energy GB said the rollout costs accounts for \u00a320 of an average \u00a31,1000 bill. Deshmukh said that not only was the economic argument overwhelming, but the meters were essential to bring forward more green energy.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The UK engineering company GKN has been forced to retract statements suggesting it has backing from shareholders to fend off a hostile \u00a37.9bn takeover bid from the turnaround specialist Melrose. At the weekend, GKN executives gave bullish interviews in which they expressed confidence that investors would back the industrial group, including pointed references to long-term shareholders supporting its strategy. Short-term investors, including hedge funds, control about 25% of GKN. GKN rowed back on those interviews on Monday. In a statement to the London Stock Exchange, it said: \u201cThese statements of shareholder support in respect of GKN were not verified and are hereby retracted.\u201d The Sunday Telegraph had quoted Anne Stevens, the GKN chief executive, as saying she was \u201cconvinced investors will back [GKN]\u201d. The Sunday Times quoted Jos Sclater, the finance director, as saying that \u201clong-only shareholders are mostly supportive of existing management, and understand that the Dana deal and becoming a pure play aerospace company has, longer term, significantly more value than the Melrose bid\u201d. As the battle heated up, GKN on Monday sought to persuade shareholders to back an alternative deal with Dana by saying it would receive more cash from the US company and would return \u00a3700m to shareholders as soon as possible. GKN shares rose 0.4% to 430.6p in early trading, with the Melrose bid valuing GKN at 460.7p. Investors have to decide by 1pm on Thursday whether to support the offer from Melrose or the GKN management plan to spin off its automotive business and merge it with Dana, leaving GKN focused on aerospace. Shareholders are divided, with those officially backing Melrose accounting for nearly 10% of the shareholder base, compared with 9% for those supporting the GKN board. Elliott Advisors and Aviva Investors support the Melrose takeover, while Columbia Threadneedle and Jupiter Asset Management are backing GKN\u2019s plan. GKN\u2019s statement prompted Melrose to make a further appeal to shareholders. Christopher Miller, the Melrose chairman, urged GKN investors to accept its offer: \u201cThe alternative is the reckless dismemberment of a business and needless value destruction for all stakeholders. \u201cToday\u2019s tweak of terms on the sale of Driveline to Dana does not offset the 7% reduction in equity value since the announcement. The last-minute attempts of claiming shareholder support that then had to be retracted [are] a sign of desperation.\u201d Melrose promised to more than double shareholders\u2019 investment by creating additional value of more than \u00a36.5bn, or 220p per GKN share. But Mike Turner, the GKN chairman, reiterated to investors that the company\u2019s true value was more than \u00a35 a share and that Melrose\u2019s final offer \u201cfundamentally undervalues your company and should be rejected\u201d. GKN said on Monday that Dana had increased the amount of cash payable by $140m (\u00a3100m). GKN will now receive $1.77bn in cash after deducting $1bn for the transfer of the pension deficit to the Dana-GKN Driveline group. GKN shareholders will continue to own 47.25% of the combined company, which would be listed on the New York and London stock exchanges. GKN plans to return up to \u00a3700m of cash to shareholders \u201cas soon as practicable\u201d after the deal with Dana \u2013 the first instalment of the up to \u00a32.5bn cash return programme was announced previously. Turner said: \u201cGKN has reinvented itself numerous times in its 250-year history. We are confident that, following the Dana transaction and the non-core disposals, GKN will become a pure play aerospace company with a strong balance sheet, our pension challenges behind us and a clear plan for delivering leading margin performance.\u201d Analysts at Numis said the Dana transaction was the right deal, but at the wrong price and the wrong time. \u201cThe combination of Dana and GKN Driveline to create a world leader in auto driveline has significant strategic merits. The issue we have is that the business is being sold too cheaply and too early.\u201d",

Short-term investors, including hedge funds, control about 25% of GKN. </p> \n<p>GKN rowed back on those interviews on Monday.

By the mid-19th century it had become the largest ironworks in the world, producing almost 90,000 tonnes of iron a year.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>1900</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>A reverse takeover pushed through by entrepreneur Arthur Keen created Guest, Keen &amp; Co. Two years later, Keen drove through the takeover of a reluctant Nettlefolds Ltd and the enlarged company became Guest, Keen &amp; Nettlefolds. It was the largest iron, steel and coal group in the country.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>1914-45</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>During the first half of the 20th century GKN became heavily involved in wartime production, while also making its first move into the emerging motor industry. It produced Spitfires, a specialised tank for the D-day landings and millions of steel helmets.</p>\n    <p>GKN emerged from the second world war as Britain\u2019s biggest steel producer but was virtually bankrupt.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>1960s-70s</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Faced with the Labour government\u2019s drive to nationalise the steel industry, GKN gradually withdrew from steel over the next 20 years. It pushed into the automotive industry.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>1980s</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The group made the first loss in its history; it soon expanded globally.

The last-minute attempts of claiming shareholder support that then had to be retracted [are] a sign of desperation.\u201d</p> \n<p>Melrose promised to more than double shareholders\u2019 investment by creating additional value of more than \u00a36.5bn, or 220p per GKN share. </p> \n<p>But Mike Turner, the GKN chairman, reiterated to investors that the company\u2019s true value was more than \u00a35 a share and that Melrose\u2019s final offer \u201cfundamentally undervalues your company and should be rejected\u201d.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.investegate.co.uk/gkn-plc--gkn-/rns/statement-re-gkn-driveline-and-dana/201803260705018432I/\">GKN said on Monday</a> that Dana had increased the amount of cash payable by $140m (\u00a3100m). GKN will now receive $1.77bn in cash after deducting $1bn for the transfer of the pension deficit to the Dana-GKN Driveline group. GKN shareholders will continue to own 47.25% of the combined company, which would be listed on the New York and London stock exchanges. <br></p> \n<p>GKN plans to return up to \u00a3700m of cash to shareholders \u201cas soon as practicable\u201d after the deal with Dana \u2013 the first instalment of the up to \u00a32.5bn cash return programme was announced previously.</p> \n<p>Turner said: \u201cGKN has reinvented itself numerous times in its 250-year history. We are confident that, following the Dana transaction and the non-core disposals, GKN will become a pure play aerospace company with a strong balance sheet, our pension challenges behind us and a clear plan for delivering leading margin performance.\u201d</p> \n<p>Analysts at Numis said the Dana transaction was the right deal, but at the wrong price and the wrong time. \u201cThe combination of Dana and GKN Driveline to create a world leader in auto driveline has significant strategic merits. The issue we have is that the business is being sold too cheaply and too early.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "The gender gap in UK retirement incomes has widened dramatically over the last decade, with the average single woman now \u00a385 a week behind her male counterpart, according to new data. The findings come as companies and organisations continue to report the difference between what they pay male and female staff ahead of the 4 April deadline set by the government, and suggest that gender pay inequalities do not stop after people retire. Steve Webb, the former Lib Dem pensions minister, said the figures revealed a shocking surge in the gap between older men and women. \u201cMuch more needs to be done to tackle the disadvantages faced by women in the later-life jobs market, as well as doing more to ensure women are building up better pensions in their own right in the future,\u201d he said. Webb is the director of policy at the mutual insurer Royal London, which issued the figures after a detailed analysis of newly published statistics from the Department for Work and Pensions. It said that in 2006-07, the average retired single woman had a gross income of \u00a3294 per week, while her male counterpart received \u00a3325 \u2013 a gap of \u00a331 per week. But by 2016-17, the gap had nearly trebled to \u00a385, with the average woman on \u00a3316 per week and the average man on \u00a3401, the company said. The data showed women\u2019s incomes had risen by 7% in real terms over the period, compared with a 23% increase for men, it added. Webb said his team looked at a 10-year period to iron out year-to-year fluctuations in the data, but the deterioration had all been concentrated in the last two years. The widening gap appears to be driven by two factors. One is that the real earnings of women over pension age have been pretty flat, while those of men have more than doubled. Over the last decade, according to the data, the real earnings of single women in retirement actually fell slightly \u2013 from \u00a321 per week in 2006-07 to \u00a319 in 2016-17. But for men, the average increased from \u00a317 per week to \u00a337. Meanwhile, occupational pension incomes have risen for both men and women \u2013 but with a particularly sharp increase for men. Women\u2019s average workplace pension income has risen from \u00a358 per week to \u00a381 over the decade, but men\u2019s workplace pensions have shot up from \u00a383 per week to \u00a3125, stretching their lead over women. Insurer Prudential has previously said that women could end up losing out when it came to retirement incomes because they took career breaks and changed their working patterns to look after dependants. As a result, many women will end up with smaller pension pots and some are likely to receive a reduced state pension too.",

      "bodyText": "Fears of a full-blown trade war between the United States and China have battered Asian shares again despite signs that Washington is prepared to negotiate deals around the region. South Korea announced on Monday that it had won an exemption from US duties on steel imports, easing some anxieties about damaging tariffs for one of Asia\u2019s biggest economies. Futures trading on Wall Street pointed to a rise in the markets later on Monday after the Wall Street Journal reported the US and China have started behind-the-scenes negotiations to improve American access to Chinese markets. The Dow Jones industrial average is on course to jump 0.8%, according to online trader IG Markets, while the E-Mini futures for the S&amp;P 500 leapt 0.6% on the news, an unusual move during early Asian hours. The US treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin, said at the weekend that Trump was not ready to back down but added that he had \u201cvery productive conversations\u201d with Chinese officials on the issue. However, the news was little consolation for Asian shares which were left nursing their wounds. Japan\u2019s Nikkei was down 0.4% percent after falling to a near six-month trough at the open. The Australian ASX200 was off 0.7% and Hong Kong was down 0.8%. Shares in mainland China were down 1.6%. One brighter light was South Korea\u2019s benchmark Kospi index, which was up 0.1% after news of the country\u2019s exemption from the steeel tariffs, although it has accepted quotas on its steel exports to the US and given ground on car industry regulations. Donald Trump signed a memorandum on Friday that could impose tariffs on up to $60bn of imports from China, although the measures have a 30-day consultation period before they take effect. The tariffs are on top of additional duties on steel and aluminium on a number of countries including China, which has already hit back with its own plans to slap duties on up to $3bn of U.S. imports. U.S. shares were also hit hard last week, with the Dow falling 1.8% on Friday, the S&amp;P 500 declining 2.1% and the Nasdaq off 2.4%. \u201cA faltering US stock market would be contagious, which it has been since Wednesday,\u201d Capital Economics said in a note. \u201cStocks in emerging market countries with close to ties to China remain especially vulnerable, as do companies around the world which could be affected by Chinese retaliation,\u201d it added. But Stephen Innes, head of Asia-Pacific trading at Oanda in Hong Kong, said that China\u2019s reaction to the planned tariffs was the key. \u201cHow China escalates will determine the pace of play, but Chinese retaliation so far has been more genial than initially thought, and they have made efforts for a diplomatic solution,\u201d he said. \u201cAlthough China is willing to negotiate and is likely to offer compromises, uncertainty and the fear of escalation will likely hold back market sentiment in the short run.\u201d Amid continued uncertainty and volatility, investors piled into the Japanese yen, traditionally a safe haven asset thanks to the country\u2019s massive current account surplus. The yen held at 104.90 to the US dollar after last week going below 105 for the first time since November 2016. The euro, another perceived haven for nervous investors, was up 0.1% at $1.2367. The dollar index tracking the greenback against six other major currencies, was near a one-month low at 89.423. In commodities, international Brent crude futures opened above $70 per barrel for the first time since January.",

Shares in mainland China were down 1.6%. </p> <p>One brighter light was South Korea\u2019s benchmark Kospi index, which was up 0.1% after news of the country\u2019s exemption from the steeel tariffs, although it has accepted quotas on its steel exports to the US and given ground on car industry regulations.</p> <p>Donald Trump signed a memorandum on Friday that could impose tariffs on up to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/22/eu-expects-escape-trump-steel-aluminium-tariffs-talks\">$60bn of imports from China</a>, although the measures have a 30-day consultation period before they take effect. <br></p> <p>The tariffs are on top of additional duties on steel and aluminium on a number of countries including China, which has already hit back with its own plans to slap duties on up to $3bn of U.S. imports. </p> <p>U.S. shares were also hit hard last week, with the Dow falling 1.8% on Friday, the S&amp;P 500 declining 2.1% and the Nasdaq off 2.4%. </p> <p>\u201cA faltering US stock market would be contagious, which it has been since Wednesday,\u201d Capital Economics said in a note. \u201cStocks in emerging market countries with close to ties to China remain especially vulnerable, as do companies around the world which could be affected by Chinese retaliation,\u201d it added. </p> <p>But Stephen Innes, head of Asia-Pacific trading at Oanda in Hong Kong, said that China\u2019s reaction to the planned tariffs was the key.</p> <p>\u201cHow China escalates will determine the pace of play, but Chinese retaliation so far has been more genial than initially thought, and they have made efforts for a diplomatic solution,\u201d he said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/25/is-it-time-to-break-up-the-tech-giants-such-as-facebook\">Is it time to break up the tech giants such as Facebook? | Larry Elliott</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cAlthough China is willing to negotiate and is likely to offer compromises, uncertainty and the fear of escalation will likely hold back market sentiment in the short run.\u201d</p> <p>Amid continued uncertainty and volatility, investors piled into the Japanese yen, traditionally a safe haven asset thanks to the country\u2019s massive current account surplus. </p> <p>The yen held at 104.90 to the US dollar after last week going below 105 for the first time since November 2016. The euro, another perceived haven for nervous investors, was up 0.1% at $1.2367. </p> <p>The dollar index tracking the greenback against six other major currencies, was near a one-month low at 89.423. In commodities, international Brent crude futures opened above $70 per barrel for the first time since January.</p>",
