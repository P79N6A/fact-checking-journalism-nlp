      "bodyText": "Overdraft fees and an easier system of moving personal and small business accounts are expected to be at the centre of measures intended to bolster competition in the banking sector. After a two-year investigation into the banking sector, the measures to be published on Tuesday will focus on how customers can switch accounts away from the high street \u201cbig four\u201d. Lloyds Banking Group, Royal Bank of Scotland, Barclays and HSBC hold more than 70% of the current account and small business sectors that generate \u00a314bn of revenue for the industry a year. The inquiry, first announced in July 2014 at a time when Labour was promising to create new banks, has been conducted by the Competition and Markets Authority. In its provisional findings, the watchdog backed off from creating new banks and instead focused on switching \u2013 although some challenger banks have complained that it is hard to compare \u201cfree\u201d accounts, as charges for going into the red are unclear. One idea is to allow customers to force banks to publish their maximum charges for unauthorised overdrafts. Consumer bodies have complained the provisional remedies did not go far enough, while manufacturers are calling on the CMA to foster more competition among high street banks. The manufacturers\u2019 organisation, the EEF, says companies need more confidence to approach banks for loans to fuel growth in the wake of the Brexit vote. The EEF\u2019s call came as it published the findings of a survey of manufacturers \u2013 conducted in February \u2013 which found companies are shunning bank loans, with 55% holding more cash than in the past. This would leave them exposed if banks adopt charges for holding deposits in the event of negative interest rates \u2013 a situation highlighted after Royal Bank of Scotland and its NatWest arm wrote to small businesses to warn them it might charge to hold deposits. RBS, however, has insisted it has no intention of doing so. The problems RBS has had in carving out the Williams &amp; Glyn branches \u2013 mandated by the EU to create a new competitor bank \u2013 illustrates the problems with creating new banks. Last week, the bank abandoned plans to float the Williams &amp; Glyn branch network, after a long-running process that has already cost \u00a31.5bn. The supply of credit to business has been closely monitored since the 2008 crisis, when lending dried up. The EEF\u2019s survey found that eight in 10 (85% of) manufacturers were confident of securing finance for a new business opportunity. But while 35% said they were more likely to use external finance than they were two years ago 65% disagreed. Lee Hopley, EEF\u2019s chief economist, said this was a \u201cpersistent hangover from the credit crunch, where trust and confidence in the banks stalled and never quite recovered\u201d. \u201cBut with the Brexit vote dampening investment intentions and adding to uncertainty, this pre-existing condition could now become further aggravated, posing a risk. This makes the CMA\u2019s package of reforms even more important,\u201d she said. \u201cThe CMA cannot prevent a fall in investment intentions, but it can help to strengthen supply dynamics in the market and resolve some of these long-term issues by providing swift and firm remedies that pack enough punch to stop the rot.\u201d The banks are insisting that the supply of credit is no longer a problem; when the Bank of England\u2019s governor, Mark Carney, announced the cut in interest rates to 0.25% on Thursday he made clear that banks should be ready to lend to viable businesses. One of the recommendations made by the CMA targeted at small businesses is a \u00a35m challenger prize for financial technology companies to create ways for small businesses to move accounts. The project, funded by the banks, will be overseen by the innovation charity Nesta and should be completed in mid-2018. Some of the provisional remedies were \u201ca step in the right direction\u201d, the EFF said. But it suggested banks should specialise along sector lines and develop more specialist products.",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s vote to leave the EU has had little immediate impact on people\u2019s spending habits, according to new figures that suggest more money was splashed out on clothes, meals out and day trips in July. Consumer spending picked up in July as the warm weather provided an incentive to eat out and buy new summer clothes, figures from Visa showed, contrasting with signs of a drop in business activity following the June vote to leave the EU. But releasing its first post-referendum spending report, the payments company said growth was still slower than at the start of the year. The monthly index, compiled with the financial data company Markit, showed consumer spending rose 1.6% year-on-year in July, up from a growth rate of 0.9% in June. Kevin Jenkins, UK &amp; Ireland managing director at Visa, said: \u201cJuly\u2019s data suggests that UK consumer spending is holding up despite the ongoing uncertainty following the referendum, albeit at lower levels of growth than we\u2019ve seen in the last couple of years. \u201cLooking at the last three months, the index indicates that consumers remain cautious with their spending. Overall growth is hovering nearly one percentage point below the average seen over the past two years.\u201d The hotels, restaurants and bars sector saw the steepest year-on-year rise in spending, at 8.9%, continuing a trend of people spending on experiences over things. The amount spent on recreation and culture, which includes trips to the cinema and theme parks, rose by 5.2%. Spending on clothing and footwear rebounded from a fall in June to be up 3.9% on the year in July. Annabel Fiddes, economist at Markit, said the outlook for spending was clouded by fragile consumer confidence. \u201cAlthough the July data point to signs of improvement, anxiety around Brexit and a slowing private sector economy may pose further downside risks to expenditure growth for the rest of 2016,\u201d she said. Against that backdrop the Bank of England cut interest rates to a new record low of 0.25% last week as part of a package of measures to ward off a post-referendum recession. It predicted economic growth would slow sharply in the second half of this year and hinted there would be more cuts to official borrowing costs. Other indicators on the economy since the Brexit vote show business confidence has deteriorated as companies fret over the UK\u2019s future trading relationships and ability to attract overseas investment. A monthly health check of firms in England and Wales, released on Monday, suggests most regions recorded declines in activity in July and a three-year run of employment growth came to a halt. Order books deteriorated and a weaker pound, which makes UK imports more expensive, raised cost pressures. The Lloyds Bank regional PMI report, also compiled with Markit, signalled the sharpest drop in activity for businesses in England since April 2009, when the global financial crisis was buffeting the UK economy. London suffered the biggest drop in activity while the east of England and the east Midlands defied the broader downturn. In Wales, business activity remained little changed from the month before, according to the poll of purchasing managers at more than 1,200 private manufacturing and services companies. Tim Hinton at Lloyds Banking Group said: \u201cAs expected, business activity has slowed on the back of the EU referendum result. While the impact has been felt across the UK, companies in the south-east and London were hit particularly hard. \u201cUK firms will likely face challenges in the short-term but the Bank of England\u2019s decision to cut interest rates could help crystallise important investment decisions and in turn support the economy.\u201d A separate report from accountants BDO suggested that business confidence had dropped to a three-year low based on a collation of existing surveys taken in recent weeks. However, the drop was \u201cnot yet as dramatic as may have been predicted\u201d, the authors said. The next indicator on spending since the referendum vote comes on Tuesday from the British Retail Consortium. There is fresh news on the housing market on Thursday, with a report from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS). Economists at Daiwa Capital Markets in London said the reports are \u201cexpected to confirm that activity in the retail sector and housing market declined in the weeks following the vote to leave the EU\u201d. Chris Hare, an economist at Investec, said the improved weather may have supported retail sales in July, as measured by the BRC figures. However, he highlights pressure on spending in future months. \u201cWe see consumer demand softening over time as households face a double hit from slowing employment growth and a real income squeeze from higher imported inflation, due to falls in sterling,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "The satirist Peter Cook had a famous skit in which he played a second world war RAF officer sending a pilot on a suicide mission to Germany. \u201cI want you to lay down your life, Perkins,\u201d Cook\u2019s character says. \u201cWe need a futile gesture at this stage. It will raise the whole tone of the war. Get up in a crate, Perkins, pop over to Bremen, take a shufti, don\u2019t come back.\u201d There are some among Mark Carney\u2019s critics who think the actions taken by the Bank of England last week fall into the \u201cfutile gesture\u201d category. They dispute the governor\u2019s assertion that the package of stimulus measures agreed by the monetary policy committee was \u201ctimely, coherent and comprehensive\u201d. On the contrary, they have argued that the Bank is being over-hasty and is over-confident in its ability to make a difference to the economy as it adjusts after the Brexit referendum. Most of this criticism is unfair. As Carney made clear last week, there are limits to what the Bank can do with the tools at its disposal. It can cut the cost of borrowing marginally, take steps to keep credit flowing from the commercial banks to households and businesses, and it can drive down the level of the pound. But it can\u2019t cut VAT or exploit ultra-low interest rates to invest in long-term public spending projects. These are matters for the Treasury. Nor can the Bank solve the deep structural problems that have held back the economy for decades: an over-reliance on the property market as a source of growth; an undersized productive sector that results in a chronic trade deficit; a lack of skills and investment that manifests itself in a poor productivity record. The truth is that monetary policy \u2013 which is what the Bank does \u2013 has been overburdened ever since the financial crisis erupted nigh on a decade ago. It was then assumed by finance ministers that they could leave most of the heavy lifting to central banks. The first line of defence would be cuts in interest rates. The second line of defence would be quantitative easing: measures that would pump money into the economy and drive down long-term interest rates. The third line of defence would be incentives to persuade the banks to lend money. As a result of all this, growth would pick up to its old pre-crisis levels; tax receipts would come rolling in and governments could set about reducing the big budget deficits that had been amassed during the crisis. There have been times when this approach has worked well. In the aftermath of Britain\u2019s departure from the exchange rate mechanism in 1992, monetary policy was loosened aggressively and rapidly. Official interest rates came down from 10% to 6% in a matter of months, and the pound fell by 15%, boosting exports. At the same time, the then Conservative government led by John Major, introduced a couple of tough tax-raising budgets that sucked demand out of the economy. The result was a strong and balanced recovery in which consumer spending was held in check by the tax increases but where investment and exports were stimulated by lower interest rates and the weaker pound. So why did the same recipe not work after the financial crisis? One reason was that the crisis was deeper and more widespread. World trade growth collapsed and has never really recovered to its pre-2007 levels. That has made it harder for countries to generate export-led growth, even when their currencies had fallen in value. Similarly, those firms motivated by lower interest rates to borrow for new investment projects found that banks \u2013 badly damaged by the crisis \u2013 were unable or unwilling to lend. Finally, the 15 years between Black Wednesday and the start of the financial crisis saw household indebtedness rise sharply, especially in the Anglo-Saxon countries, and there was less appetite for fresh borrowing even at historically low rates. Monetary policy, in other words, was not nearly as potent as central banks and finance ministries thought it would be. So, when finance ministers such as George Osborne raised taxes and curbed spending, it did not lead to the balanced growth seen in the mid-1990s; it brought the economy to a standstill. The upshot has been that interest rates have remained lower for longer than envisaged back in early 2009, when they were cut to what was considered the emergency level of 0.5%. And the failure of monetary policy to deliver a sustained, balanced recovery has meant deficit-reduction plans have had to be torn up too. Between them, the Bank of England and the Treasury did manage to generate a pick up in growth from early 2013 onwards, but only by pumping up the housing market with cheap money and government subsidies. By late last year, even before a date for the EU referendum was known, there were signs that the recovery was running out of steam. The obvious downside of the Brexit vote is that it threatens to turn a slowdown into a recession. The upside is that it provides the opportunity \u2013 available when the economy has been hit by a profound shock \u2013 to rethink policy. Criticism of the Bank for adopting the \u201csledgehammer\u201d approach favoured by its chief economist, Andy Haldane, is wide of the mark. The argument is that households and businesses will think things must be really bad if Threadneedle Street feels the need to act with such force. But it seems more likely that the Bank will have provided reassurance that it is doing its best to limit the fallout from Brexit. It seems wholly appropriate to try to shore up confidence. At the same time, it needs to be recognised that there are potential side-effects to the Bank\u2019s stimulus package. By signalling so clearly that official interest rates are likely to be cut again before Christmas, the Bank is inviting investors to sell pounds. A lower exchange rate will make imports dearer, pushing up inflation. At present, wages are rising slightly faster than the cost of living, leading to rising real incomes. But living standards could start to fall if inflation picks up at the same time as slower growth leads to less generous pay awards. In reality, Carney has bought Philip Hammond a bit of time. The Bank can only really generate a more modest version of the muted and unbalanced recovery seen after the great recession of 2008-09. A cut in VAT would do more to boost confidence and demand than a quarter point bank rate cut, and would bear down on inflation. Borrowing for long-term capital projects has never been cheaper. The Treasury could issue infrastructure bonds and get the Bank to buy them. There is little more that Threadneedle Street can do. It is now up to the new chancellor to seize his moment.",

They dispute the governor\u2019s assertion that the package of stimulus measures agreed by the monetary policy committee was \u201ctimely, coherent and comprehensive\u201d. On the contrary, they have argued that the Bank is being over-hasty and is over-confident in its ability to make a difference to the economy as it adjusts after the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">Brexit </a>referendum.</p> <p>Most of this criticism is unfair. As Carney made clear last week, there are limits to what the Bank can do with the tools at its disposal. It can cut the cost of borrowing marginally, take steps to keep credit flowing from the commercial banks to households and businesses, and it can drive down the level of the pound. But it can\u2019t cut VAT or exploit ultra-low interest rates to invest in long-term public spending projects. These are matters for the Treasury. Nor can the Bank solve the deep structural problems that have held back the economy for decades: an over-reliance on the property market as a source of growth; an undersized productive sector that results in a chronic trade deficit; a lack of skills and investment that manifests itself in a poor productivity record.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/06/observer-view-on-the-economy\">The Observer view on the economy | Observer editorial</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The truth is that monetary policy \u2013 which is what the Bank does \u2013 has been overburdened ever since the financial crisis erupted nigh on a decade ago. It was then assumed by finance ministers that they could leave most of the heavy lifting to central banks. The first line of defence would be cuts in interest rates. The second line of defence would be quantitative easing: measures that would pump money into the economy and drive down long-term interest rates. The third line of defence would be incentives to persuade the banks to lend money. As a result of all this, growth would pick up to its old pre-crisis levels; tax receipts would come rolling in and governments could set about reducing the big budget deficits that had been amassed during the crisis.</p> <p>There have been times when this approach has worked well. In the aftermath of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/sep/13/black-wednesday-bad-day-conservatives\">Britain\u2019s departure from the exchange rate mechanism in 1992</a>, monetary policy was loosened aggressively and rapidly. Official interest rates came down from 10% to 6% in a matter of months, and the pound fell by 15%, boosting exports.</p> <p>At the same time, the then Conservative government led by John Major, introduced a couple of tough tax-raising budgets that sucked demand out of the economy. The result was a strong and balanced recovery in which consumer spending was held in check by the tax increases but where investment and exports were stimulated by lower interest rates and the weaker pound.</p> <p>So why did the same recipe not work after the financial crisis? One reason was that the crisis was deeper and more widespread. World trade growth collapsed and has never really recovered to its pre-2007 levels. That has made it harder for countries to generate export-led growth, even when their currencies had fallen in value. Similarly, those firms motivated by lower interest rates to borrow for new investment projects found that banks \u2013 badly damaged by the crisis \u2013 were unable or unwilling to lend.

      "bodyText": "In lots of ways, comments about UK banks not competing aggressively seem overly harsh. For years now, they have all been battling to disgrace themselves in increasingly outrageous ways, while also pioneering more and more creative ways in which to further irk their shareholders. We saw it again last week, when Royal Bank of Scotland slumped to a \u00a32bn half-year loss and HSBC reported a 29% fall in first-half profits to $9.7bn \u2013 both of which came with a string of legal and regulatory warnings. But this week, prepare for the focus to switch \u2013 when we\u2019ll ask whether these institutions have been striving so hard to win in the humiliation stakes that they\u2019ve forgotten to compete for the benefit of their customers. The Competition and Markets Authority has been investigating the supply of personal current accounts and of banking services to small- and medium-sized enterprises \u2013 and on Tuesday it will publish a summary of its final report. The CMA has shown only slightly more appetite for addressing these questions than the bankers \u2013 having previously stated that banks must cap overdraft charges, while still allowing them to decide where to set the cap. Cynics have suggested that there may be a slight flaw in that plan. Rival suggestions could be sought. Pru set to dent low strike numbers As you may have read last week, the number of workers that went on strike in Britain last year was the lowest recorded in more than 120 years. Official figures show that 81,000 workers were involved in strike action in 2015, down from 733,300 in 2014 and the smallest number since records began in 1893 (the previous low was 93,000 in 1998 and 2005). When statisticians first began noting down those records, the insurance firm Prudential was in middle age, having already been operating for 45 years. It hasn\u2019t troubled the industrial action scorers massively since then but, as we approach its results this week, the company is threatening to get its name on the scoresheet later this year after devising one of those schemes to outsource jobs to India. Prudential employees based in Reading are now being balloted by the union Unite on strike action over the plans, which will see 75 jobs dealing with annuities being filled in Mumbai. Prudential says demand for annuities has slumped while Unite reckons the plan will save around \u00a32m \u2013 which seems neat: new Pru UK boss John Foley can earn a maximum yearly salary and bonus of about, er, \u00a32m. Dinner party topic going flat Is the south-east of England\u2019s favourite dinner party conversation topic about to crash? This is, of course, the most pressing concern for a chunk of the population post Brexit: can they deflect attention from how they\u2019ve messed up the latest Yotam Ottolenghi recipe by bragging about how much their property portfolio has soared? The evidence is beginning to come in \u2013 albeit in ways that frequently allow each side to see whatever they wish. Last week a survey by Halifax, Britain\u2019s biggest mortgage lender, suggested that house prices fell 1% last month after the vote to leave the EU, which followed figures from its rival Nationwide a week earlier, showing prices rising 0.5% in July. Meanwhile, economists at French bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale have said London prices could fall 30% and halve in the most expensive boroughs; Foxtons and other estate agents have warned that business has slowed sharply since the referendum (every cloud and all that); while the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) has predicted a slump in property transactions, with its members more gloomy about prospects than at any point since the late 1990s.

      "bodyText": "So farewell, Kevin Roberts. The Saatchi &amp; Saatchi executive chairman resigned last week after giving an interview to Business Insider that was so riddled with sexism and complacency it is difficult to pick out a particular soundbite. To summarise, Roberts said that there was no problem with sexual discrimination at Saatchi &amp; Saatchi and that some women, and men, were looking just to be happy in life rather than climb up the ranks of a company. He also accused a female campaigner of \u201cmaking up a lot of stuff to create a profile\u201d. Roberts was put on leave by Saatchi &amp; Saatchi at the weekend before resigning on Wednesday, apologising for \u201cmy miscommunication on a number of points\u201d. This should not be the end of the matter, however. For a start, it was noticeable that Roberts apologised for \u201cmiscommunication\u201d rather than the views that were expressed, while Saatchi &amp; Saatchi also allowed him to resign rather than firing him, allowing the Lancastrian to protect what is left of his reputation. But more importantly, chasing Roberts out of his job and celebrating his departure does not mean that all is well again in the advertising industry and beyond. To put it simply, all businesses are failing to put male and female workers on an equal footing. While some are heading in the right direction, there is so much more to do. The Women\u2019s Equality party in Britain wants quotas to be introduced so that 50% of a company\u2019s board and 50% of its executive committee are made up of women within the next 10 years. It has also made proposals about how British companies can get there, including overhauling maternity and paternity policies so that there is shared parental leave of six weeks at 90% pay for both partners, and free childcare from nine months. Companies should also be forced to publish the average pay of male and female employees, and the gender balance at each level of management. Despite the efforts of campaigners and the government-backed report by Lord Davies, the situation in Britain is shocking. Among leading companies there appears to be a mixture of those doing the minimum amount acceptable and those not bothering at all. The Female FTSE Board Report, produced by Cranfield University, showed that less than 25% of boardroom recruits to FTSE 100 firms were female in the six months to March 2016, the lowest level since 2011. This drop in recruitment is not because FTSE 100 boardrooms are overflowing with female voices. Just 26% of FTSE 100 directors are women \u2013 and the vast majority of these female directors are non-executives with no day-to-day power. When you just consider executive directors \u2013 such as chief executives or finance directors \u2013 the proportion falls to just 9.7%. It is far easier for a company to increase its proportion of female directors by appointing an established businesswoman as a non-executive, rather than developing its own female employees and encouraging them through the ranks so they become executives. Perhaps Roberts, who was also \u201chead coach\u201d for Saatchi &amp; Saatchi\u2019s parent, Publicis, should now be charged with helping firms elevate their female employees to the upper echelons of management? After all, he seems to understand their mindset. On second thoughts, the Lancastrian should be left to enjoy holidays in his property in the Lake District. Britain has someone else far better placed to ensure gender equality in the boardroom and in business: Theresa May, the new prime minister. May has already spoken about tackling executive pay and corporate governance at Britain\u2019s biggest companies. This must include dealing with the imbalance between men and women in the boardroom. No one should celebrate Roberts\u2019s departure from Saatchi &amp; Saatchi. It does not solve anything. The important lesson from the saga must be that all businesses have a long way to go to improve the opportunities available for women \u2013 not that male executives should learn to keep their thoughts to themselves. Rest of world shrugs off Brexit These are early days in the post-referendum economy as far as solid data goes. Unsurprisingly then, commentators are divided over quite how serious the hit to demand and output has been. Surveys suggest confidence and activity tumbled in the wake of the vote to leave the EU, emboldening those who predicted a Brexit recession. Others, who think the UK can ride out this phase of uncertainty, say those early readings overplay firms\u2019 and consumers\u2019 kneejerk reactions to the vote. That debate will rumble on for some time. But here is one prediction that has not yet come true: that a vote for Brexit would send shockwaves through the global economy. So said the International Monetary Fund, so warned the Bank of England. Yet now it seems these observers fell into the trap of overestimating the UK\u2019s role on the world stage. Global fallout from the vote has yet to transpire. When it cut interest rates to a new record low last week, the Bank predicted the UK economy would suffer a sharp slowdown. As for global effects, there was less to be said: policymakers noted instead that there was \u201clittle evidence so far\u201d of any \u201csizeable adverse economic impact\u201d. Business polls since the referendum signal a drop in output for the UK, but readings from equivalent surveys for the eurozone were little changed from before the historic vote. It is a similar story from the US, where the latest jobs report showed strong employment growth and a pick-up in earnings in July, putting an interest rate rise from the US Federal Reserve in play for as soon as September. None of that is to say that a global economy that was febrile before the UK\u2019s referendum is out of the woods. European banks, notably in Italy, still look vulnerable. China\u2019s debt-fuelled economy continues its struggle to rebalance. The US faces its own uncertainties as the election nears. Brexit contagion comes low down on this list of global risks. So far it seems the UK is taking the big hit. Britain voted to stand alone, and now it does. Big money will be on small screens Adults now spend an average of one day in seven online \u2013 a whole 25 hours a week. This year\u2019s state of the nation report from telecoms watchdog Ofcom also finds that two-thirds of Britons credit the internet with inspiring them to try new things, such as recipes, restaurants, travel destinations and cultural events. Google and Facebook may count their profits in multiples of billions but they are barely scratching the surface. Smartphones, the most widely owned internet device, are where the greatest advertising opportunity lies. The majority of laptops now use ad-blocking software, but commercial messaging is harder to shut out from smartphone social media apps, which people check between 10 and 50 times a day. In the UK, the mobile ad market is worth \u00a32.6bn, but the smallest screens account for just 30% of all spending on digital ads. Expect that balance to shift.",

      "body": "<p>So farewell, Kevin Roberts. The Saatchi &amp; Saatchi executive chairman resigned last week after giving an interview to <em>Business Insider</em> that was so riddled with sexism and complacency it is difficult to pick out a particular soundbite.</p> <p>To summarise, Roberts said that there was no problem with sexual discrimination at Saatchi &amp; Saatchi and that some women, and men, were looking just to be happy in life rather than climb up the ranks of a company. He also accused a female campaigner of \u201cmaking up a lot of stuff to create a&#xa0;profile\u201d.</p> <p>Roberts was put on leave by Saatchi &amp; Saatchi at the weekend before <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/aug/03/saatchi-saatchi-boss-kevin-roberts-resigns-amid-sexism-row\" title=\"\">resigning on Wednesday,</a> apologising for \u201cmy miscommunication on a number of points\u201d.</p> <p>This should not be the end of the matter, however. For a start, it was noticeable that Roberts apologised for \u201cmiscommunication\u201d rather than the views that were expressed, while Saatchi &amp; Saatchi also allowed him to resign rather than firing him, allowing the Lancastrian to protect what is left of his reputation.</p> <p>But more importantly, chasing Roberts out of his job and celebrating his departure does not mean that all is well again in the advertising industry and beyond. To put it simply, all businesses are failing to put male and female workers on an equal footing. While some are heading in the right direction, there is so much more to do.</p> <p>The Women\u2019s Equality party in Britain wants quotas to be introduced so that 50% of a company\u2019s board and 50% of its executive committee are made up of women within the next 10 years. It has also made proposals about how British companies can get there, including overhauling maternity and paternity policies so that there is shared parental leave of six weeks at 90% pay for both partners, and free childcare from nine months. Companies should also be forced to publish the average pay of male and female employees, and the gender balance at each level of management.</p> <p>Despite the efforts of campaigners and the government-backed report by Lord Davies, the situation in Britain is shocking. Among leading companies there appears to be a mixture of those doing the minimum amount acceptable and those not bothering at all.</p> <p>The Female FTSE Board Report, produced by Cranfield University, showed that less than 25% of boardroom recruits to FTSE 100 firms were female in the six months to March 2016, the lowest level since 2011.</p> <p>This drop in recruitment is not because FTSE 100 boardrooms are overflowing with female voices. Just 26% of FTSE 100 directors are women \u2013 and the vast majority of these female directors are non-executives with no day-to-day power. When you just consider executive directors \u2013 such as chief executives or finance directors \u2013 the proportion falls to just 9.7%.</p> <p>It is far easier for a company to increase its proportion of female directors by appointing an established businesswoman as a non-executive, rather than developing its own female employees and encouraging them through the ranks so they become executives.</p> <p>Perhaps Roberts, who was also \u201chead coach\u201d for Saatchi &amp; Saatchi\u2019s parent, Publicis, should now be charged with helping firms elevate their female employees to the upper echelons of management? After all, he seems to understand their mindset.</p> <p>On second thoughts, the Lancastrian should be left to enjoy holidays in his property in the Lake District. Britain has someone else far better placed to ensure gender equality in the boardroom and in business: Theresa May, the new prime minister. May has already spoken about tackling executive pay and corporate governance at Britain\u2019s biggest companies. This must include dealing with the imbalance between men and women in the boardroom.</p> <p>No one should celebrate Roberts\u2019s departure from Saatchi &amp; Saatchi. It does not solve anything. The important lesson from the saga must be that all businesses have a long way to go to improve the opportunities available for women \u2013 not that male executives should learn to keep their thoughts to themselves.</p> <h2>Rest of world shrugs off Brexit<br></h2> <p>These are early days in the post-referendum economy as far as solid data goes. Unsurprisingly then, commentators are divided over quite how serious the hit to demand and output has been. Surveys suggest confidence and activity tumbled in the wake of the vote to leave the EU, emboldening those who predicted a Brexit recession. Others, who think the UK can ride out this phase of uncertainty, say those early readings overplay firms\u2019 and consumers\u2019 kneejerk reactions to the vote.</p> <p>That debate will rumble on for some time. But here is one prediction that has not yet come true: that a vote for Brexit would send shockwaves through the global economy.</p> <p>So <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/14/imf-chief-issues-impassioned-plea-for-britain-to-stay-in-eu\" title=\"\">said the International Monetary Fund</a>, so <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/16/bank-of-england-economy-will-be-hit-hard-if-britain-leaves-eu\" title=\"\">warned the Bank of England</a>.
