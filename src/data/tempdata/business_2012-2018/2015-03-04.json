Let\u2019s put the Australian economy on the table, get it to open, say ahhh, and find out just what is going on. </p> <h2>1. <strong><strong><strong><strong>Weak growth; getting weaker</strong></strong></strong></strong></h2> <p>You don\u2019t mind the occasional weak quarter of growth, but we\u2019re making a habit of it. Six of the past 10 quarters have seen the economy grow by 0.5% or less.<br></p> <p>When you consider that we need the economy to grow by around 3.1% just to stop the unemployment rate from rising, quarterly growth of 0.5%, which annualises out to just 2%, means grim times for jobs:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"graph 1\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/wnxGW/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The December <a href=\"http://www.budget.gov.au/2014-15/content/myefo/html/02_part_2-02.htm\">Mid-year economic and fiscal outlook</a> (Myefo) predicted real GDP would grow by 2.5% in the 2014-15. In the first six months of that period it grew by just 0.87% - on track for annual growth of just 1.7%. </p> <p>And nominal GDP, which is the better for estimating taxation revenue, grew by just 1.6% in 2014 \u2013 the worst result since during the midst of the GFC. The Myefo estimated nominal GDP in 2014-15 would grow by 1.5%, at the moment it is on track to grow by just 0.8%. If that weak growth remains, it\u2019s very likely Joe Hockey will see a revenue shortfall in the May budget from what was anticipated in December.</p> <h2>2. <strong>Exports prices down, but volume is up</strong></h2> <p>Some goods news within the figures is that despite slumping prices of commodities, our exports volumes are still doing well:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"graph 2\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/pQgqT/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Exports grew by 7.2% on seasonally adjusted terms in the past year, and by a slightly less exuberant 5.3% in trend terms. </p> <p>And while our terms of trade \u2013 which measures the price of our exports compared with our imports \u2013 fell nearly 10% in trend terms over the past year, the fall was not as bad as might have been expected due to the fall in the price of oil, which we import.</p> <p>And thus our net exports (exports minus our imports) contributed a solid 1.4 percentage points to annual growth. This was not as strong as in the last quarter, but overall the contribution of net exports looks be holding quite steady:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"graph 3\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/PkhEf/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>And yet, it was not the biggest driver of growth ...<br><br></p> <h2>3. <strong>Ching! Ching! Ching! We\u2019re spending big</strong></h2> <p>Yes, the economy is weak, but Australians are spending quite impressively. I honestly have no explanation. Consumer confidence is low, wages growth is pitiful, unemployment is rising, and retail sales data is pretty limp \u2013 and yet household final expenditure grew by 2.7% in the past year \u2013 the strongest growth since 2011:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"graph 4\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/BTzAo/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Household consumption actually contributed the most to trend growth in the past quarter and year \u2013 more than that of net exports:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"graph 5\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/M1k5K/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>And what are we spending on? Would you believe it is recreation and culture? </p> <p>In the past year, growth of spending in that area contributed 0.5 percentage points towards the 2.7% overall consumption growth. It was effectively tied with spending on rents and that spent in hotels, cafes and restaurants: </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"graph 6\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/xOtZ6/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"600\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Going by these figures we\u2019ve all decided to go out to the movies and concerts, stay a night at a hotel, have a meal at restaurant before going home to our house \u2013 the rent for which seems to be climbing more than we would like. </p> <p>One thing we\u2019re not doing is smoking. Consumption of cigarettes and tobacco fell by 8.9% in trend terms. That ties with the third biggest fall ever in smoking consumption (the two biggest falls occurred back in 1983 when Paul Keating linked the excise on tobacco to the inflation rate):</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"graph 7\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/sp3B7/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>We\u2019re also spending a lot more on communications than we used to \u2013 up 7.6%. But because we don\u2019t spend as much on that as other items, growth in that spending only contributed 0.2 percentage points to overall household consumption growth.</p> <h2><strong>4. Mining boom: thanks for coming</strong></h2> <p>Does the December 2014 quarter mark the real end of the mining boom? In trend terms gross value added in the mining industry did not grow at all. As a result, despite still contributing the most to economic growth over the past year, in the last quarter it contributed nothing:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"graph 8\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/tKbu8/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"600\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Within the mining industry, the big fall in the past quarter was coal mining and the oil and gas extraction sector \u2013 both of which saw gross value added decline in the December quarter:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"graph 9\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/LIUjl/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>But even the iron ore sector saw slowing growth and is coming off the boil quickly \u2013 quarterly growth of just 1.7% compared with the 5.6% growth observed in the March 2014 quarter.</p> <p>For the future, it appears any joy from the mining sector will come via exports rather than production and investment. </p> <h2><strong>5. Investment down; housing construction up, but not by enough</strong></h2> <p>Maybe you have heard about the housing boom going on in Sydney and other parts of the country?</p> <p>Well, yep, it\u2019s a thing alright. Investment in private dwelling construction grew by 5.6% in 2014 \u2013 although it is down on the annual growth of 7.9% observed six months ago:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"graph 9\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/LUOJT/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>But while more dwellings being built is great for the economy \u2013 and vital given the end of the construction phase of the mining boom \u2013 at the moment it isn\u2019t enough to offset the fall in investment in the mining sector.</p> <p>Private dwelling investment is only around 60% the amount of non-dwelling construction investment (i.e. engineering construction). So while a 5.6% increase in dwelling construction is pleasing, it can\u2019t make up for the 10.9% fall in investment in non-dwelling construction. </p> <p>That fall took one percentage point off of GDP growth over the past year, whereas investment in dwellings added just 0.3 percentage points:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"graph 10\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/ntzFN/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <h2><strong>6. As goes mining, so goes demand in Western Australia and Queensland</strong></h2> <p>In 2011 and 2012, Western Australia was the big driver of economic growth in the nation. State final demand in WA contributed a whopping two percentage points to annual growth in the 12 months to March 2012. Only NSW had ever contributed that much growth \u2013 and that was back in 1994. </p> <p>But in 2014, the state final demand in WA took away 0.4 percentage points from Australia\u2019s GDP \u2013 it was a drag on the rest of the economy. So too was Queensland: </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"graph 11\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/tnuTm/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>But we shouldn\u2019t get too down on those states. Final demand does not include exports, and clearly our exports are massively important for generating growth in the whole economy. </p> <h2><strong>7. Labour isn\u2019t working as much, but still as hard</strong></h2> <p>The productivity and labour cost figures were a bit of a mixed bag. In the past quarter there was a fall in the number of hours worked (although oddly a rise in the number of hours worked in the market sector). It meant that GDP per hours worked grew by 1.7% in 2014 \u2013 up a bit from the previous quarter, but still down on where it was in 2012 and 2013.</p> <p>The average over five years (which gives us a better indicator of how productivity is really growing) was 1.6% \u2013 just below the long term average of 1.7%. So it\u2019s doing ok, but not much more than that.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"graph 13\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/rqdLC/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>When it comes to labour costs, the picture is also a bit mixed. Real unit labour costs rose in the past year. While this might suggest Australia is becoming less competitive because our wages and other labour costs are growing too fast, wages are growing by next to bugger all.</p> <p>The issue is that according to the index used to measure inflation for the GDP figures, prices actually fell by 0.8% in the past year. It meant for real labour costs to fall, the nominal labour costs needed to fall by more than that. They didn\u2019t \u2013 nominal labour costs fell by 0.1%:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"graph 14\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/GusA4/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>That 0.1% fall is itself amazing. Over the past 15 years, nominal labour costs grew on average 2.8% each year. </p> <p>The lack of growth in nominal labour costs in 2014 as much as anything reveals how weak the economy is going at the moment. There may be exports, but there is a lack of investment which is in turn leading to a lack of demand for labour. </p> <p>It\u2019s why the growth in consumption is so surprising, and why it would also be surprising were it to continue. There\u2019s only so long you can keep increasing your spending, if your wages and hours working aren\u2019t growing. </p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Bank of England is facing an unprecedented criminal investigation by the Serious Fraud Office over emergency lending measures it took at the height of the credit crisis to inject cash into financial markets. In late 2007 and early 2008, as the authorities struggled to prevent financial markets from freezing up, banks were invited to bid to borrow funds from the Bank of England in exchange for collateral in a series of so-called \u201cauctions\u201d. It is the conduct of these liquidity auctions that is now being investigated by the SFO, which confirmed it has opened an official investigation. In a statement, the SFO said it was \u201cinvestigating material referred to it by the Bank of England concerning liquidity auctions during the financial crisis in 2007 and 2008\u201d. In response, Threadneedle Street said: \u201cThe Bank can now confirm that it commissioned Lord Grabiner QC to conduct an independent inquiry into liquidity auctions during the financial crisis in 2007 and 2008. Following the conclusion of that initial inquiry, the BoE referred the matter to the SFO on 20 November 2014.\u201d The Bank refused further comment. It remains unclear why the investigation was not made public before now. Mark Carney, the Bank\u2019s governor, had refused to comment when asked about the investigation by MPs earlier this week. It was also unclear whether the Bank\u2019s employees are suspected of involvement in any attempt to rig the auctions, which were used to ensure that banks were able to function effectively even as liquidity dried up in many parts of the financial markets, before full-blown quantitative easing was launched in 2009. A spokeswoman was unable to say whether any Bank employees had been suspended while further inquiries were carried out. Andrew Tyrie, chairman of the Treasury select committee \u2013 which holds the Bank accountable \u2013 said he had been informed about the referral to the SFO on 21 November. He added: \u201cWe must now await the outcome of the SFO\u2019s work. The sooner their findings are published the better.\u201d The SFO investigation is expected to last for a matter of months. Grabiner had previously made a separate investigation into the Bank\u2019s role in the rigging of foreign exchange markets. While he largely gave the Bank a clean bill of health, Threadneedle Street announced last week a series of reforms to make its contacts with City traders more transparent, and ensure that any future suspicions about activity in the markets are referred up the management chain.

News of this new criminal inquiry will underline fears that the Bank\u2019s relationship with the City was sometimes too cosy.

      "bodyText": "Food safety experts and campaigners questioned plans by McDonald\u2019s to stop serving chickens fed and injected with antibiotics at its 14,000 US restaurants on Wednesday and pointed to a similar, failed, pledge from the fast-food giant. The world\u2019s largest restaurant chain has announced it will stop selling chicken raised with antibiotics that are important to human health. The move comes following pressure from US government bodies and others who fear the practice is contributing to the rise in antibiotic-resistant infections. Food chain experts hailed the move and said it would pressure rivals to make similar changes \u2013 but they also highlighted that McDonald\u2019s had yet to fulfil a similar pledge made in 2003. McDonald\u2019s, which is suffering one of the biggest crises in its 75-year history as its customers defect to more ethically sourced rivals such as Chipolte and Shake Shack, said it would phase out the use of chicken raised with antibiotics \u201cimportant to human medicine\u201d within two years. \u201cOur customers want food that they feel great about eating \u2013 all the way from the farm to the restaurant \u2013 and these moves take a step toward better delivering on those expectations,\u201d McDonald\u2019s US president, Mike Andres, said on Wednesday. Chipotle, Panera Bread and Shake Shack only sell antibiotic-free products. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have long called on McDonald\u2019s, and the food industry in general, to end the practice of routinely using antibiotics in livestock rearing, which contributes to widespread antibiotics resistance in humans. The CDC said more than two million Americans a year develop bacterial infections resistant to antibiotics, which it said leads to 23,000 deaths a year. The Guardian has learned that this is not the first time that McDonald\u2019s has made \u2013 and failed to keep to \u2013 a similar antibiotics-use pledge. In 2003 McDonald\u2019s introduced a \u201cglobal policy on antibiotic use in food animals\u201d, which said: McDonald\u2019s prohibits the use of antibiotics belonging to classes of compounds approved for use in human medicine when used solely for growth promotion purposes. Growth promotion is defined as the use of antibiotics for any purpose other than disease treatment, control or prevention. McDonald\u2019s refused to answer questions from the Guardian about its previous antibiotics policy, nor how it would ensure it meets its pledge this time. The company also did not respond to questions about what percentage of its chickens are currently reared with antibiotics. In a statement, McDonald\u2019s said its new policy would continue to allow chickens used in its supply chain to be given antibiotic ionophores \u2013 those that are not used in human medicine. Antibiotics are routinely fed and injected into chickens to encourage them to grow bigger and stronger. The process starts in the hatchery, with antibiotics injected directly into chicks when they are still in the egg. In 2001 McDonald\u2019s pledged to reduce antibiotic use in its chickens in the UK and Europe. The company confirmed on Wednesday that it still uses antibiotics in chickens in the UK and Europe 14 years later. McDonald\u2019s did not respond to questions about the percentage of chickens that are still raised with antibiotics. In a statement, McDonald\u2019s said: \u201cAlongside today\u2019s announcements from McDonald\u2019s USA, McDonald\u2019s Europe announced plans to phase out the use of those antibiotics that play a crucial role in the human treatment of specific and serious infections and diseases in our poultry supply chain.\u201d Pamela Clough, the organiser of Public Interest Research Group\u2019s Stop the Overuse of Antibiotics campaign, said: \u201cIt\u2019s a great step forward that McDonald\u2019s has made this pledge, but its extremely worrying that they made similar promises more than 10 years ago and haven\u2019t kept to them. \u201cCan consumers trust that they can make this change now? It will require tracking, it will require that we keep tabs on what they\u2019re doing.\u201d Jonathan Kaplan, director of food and agriculture at the National Resources Defense Council, said McDonald\u2019s decision could have a \u201ctransformative impact\u201d in changing antibiotic misuse but warned that the new policy did little to improve on the 2003 pledge. \u201cAs the world\u2019s largest and most iconic restaurant chain, the McDonald\u2019s announcement sends a tsunami of a market signal, putting antibiotic-reliant producers of chickens on notice that times are changing,\u201d he said. \u201cUnfortunately, the company also published a disappointing \u2018Global Vision for Antimicrobial Stewardship in Food Animals\u2019 that sadly does little to improve the company\u2019s 2003 policy.\u201d Kaplan also warned that McDonald\u2019s continuing to allow antibiotics for \u201cdisease prevention\u201d allowed for a \u201cgiant loophole\u201d with \u201cno real limit on how much or how often these drugs can be administered\u201d. The new antibiotics policy was the first big McDonald\u2019s announcement under its new chief executive, Steve Easterbrook, who officially took over from previous boss Don Thompson on Monday. Easterbrook, the former head of McDonald\u2019s in Europe, was given a 69% increase in his base salary to $1.1m and his potential bonus was raised from 100% to 160% of his base salary. In recent weeks Easterbrook told analysts that he sees himself as an \u201cinternal activist\u201d who wants to create a \u201cmodern, progressive burger company\u201d.",

    "webTitle": "Standard Chartered's cop-out on bonuses", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Mystery number one at Standard Chartered is why chief executive Peter Sands was awarded a bonus in the first place. Sands, in common with all executives apart from new-ish finance director Andy Halford, has waived his award to \u201cshow leadership\u201d. Very sporting, but surely the role of leadership on bonuses falls to the pay committee. Relying on the bosses do the decent thing is a cop-out, particularly for a bank that has suffered a few rebellions over pay in the recent past. Let\u2019s hope Ruth Markland, Standard Chartered\u2019s remuneration chief, explains all in the upcoming annual report. In last year\u2019s she set out the main measures for executive bonuses in 2014 but Standard Chartered flunked on all counts. The share price fell 29% in the year, so even a same-again dividend couldn\u2019t rescue the total return to shareholders. Earnings per share were down 28% on a \u201cnormalised\u201d basis. And return on risk-weighted assets plunged from 2.2% to 1.6%. How are the waived bonuses meant to have arisen? Mystery number two is the status of Sands\u2019 assertion that \u201cthere are no plans to raise new capital\u201d. On the face of it, it\u2019s what shareholders wanted to hear, and Sands, to be fair, described how a rights issue can be avoided. Some $1.8bn of costs are being removed and the asset base is being derisked, thus there is a credible target to improve the core capital ratio from 10.7% to 11%-12% this year. But Sands will be chief executive only until June. Is Bill Winters, the new boss, tied by the same strategy? \u201cWe didn\u2019t have time to wait for Bill,\u201d said Halford. \u201cIt\u2019s full pedal to the floor.\u201d That was a diplomatic answer. Sands\u2019 final revving of the engine is commendable as far as it goes, but the reality is that all is uncertain until Winters has looked under the bonnet. Ups beat downs at ITV It\u2019s hard to find fault in ITV\u2019s fifth year in a row of double-digit profit increases, but let\u2019s try. Share of viewing was down 5% in 2014. ITV Studios, the production division, saw a 4% fall in revenues in the UK on an \u201corganic\u201d basis. And aren\u2019t those big entertainment formats \u2013 the likes of I\u2019m a Celebrity and Ant and Dec\u2019s Saturday Night Takeaway \u2013 looking a little long in the tooth? But that\u2019s about as far as the nit-picking goes after a 23% rise in pre-tax profits to \u00a3712m. Indeed, there are semi-explanations on the points above. On viewing, ITV merely gave back what it gained in 2013 under pressure from a strong BBC. Studios in the UK were affected by a year of World Cup football but the overseas revenues still motored. And those old formats still get good audiences and still sell overseas; even the Australians are taking Celebrity, although it is filmed in South Africa, oddly. In other words, ITV\u2019s remarkable progress continues. One of chief executive Adam Crozier\u2019s challenges is how to distribute the winnings. For the third year in a row there is a special dividend (worth \u00a3250m this time) on top of an ordinary that was lifted by a third with the promise of increases of at least 20% in the next two years. The series of specials has not strained the balance sheet. Far from it. There was net cash at the year-end of \u00a341m, even after spending \u00a3214m on acquisitions. ITV even finds itself wanting more balance sheet \u201cleverage\u201d \u2013 meaning debt \u2013 in the interests of financial efficiency. Don\u2019t expect fireworks, however. The leverage will arrive \u201cgradually\u201d and Crozier reserves the right to tweak the mix between acquisitions and special dividends as he wishes. Talks with Talpa, the Dutch production company behind The Voice, continue, for example. The only real cloud is that audience share figure. For now, though, it\u2019s having little impact on advertising revenues, probably because ITV maintains a stranglehold on shows with mass audiences on commercial TV. Ad revenues in the first quarter should rise a handy 11%. Liberty Global paid \u00a3481m, or 185p a share, for its 6.4% stake in ITV last July.

      "body": "<p>Mystery number one at Standard Chartered is why chief executive Peter Sands was awarded a bonus in the first place. Sands, in common with all executives apart from new-ish finance director Andy Halford, has waived his award to \u201cshow leadership\u201d. </p> <p>Very sporting, but surely the role of leadership on bonuses falls to the pay committee. Relying on the bosses do the decent thing is a cop-out, particularly for a bank that has suffered a few rebellions over pay in the recent past. </p> <p>Let\u2019s hope Ruth Markland, Standard Chartered\u2019s remuneration chief, explains all in the upcoming annual report. In last year\u2019s she set out the main measures for executive bonuses in 2014 but Standard Chartered flunked on all counts. The share price fell 29% in the year, so even a same-again dividend couldn\u2019t rescue the total return to shareholders. Earnings per share were down 28% on a \u201cnormalised\u201d basis. And return on risk-weighted assets plunged from 2.2% to 1.6%. How are the waived bonuses meant to have arisen?</p> <p>Mystery number two is the status of Sands\u2019 assertion that \u201cthere are no plans to raise new capital\u201d.</p> <p>On the face of it, it\u2019s what shareholders wanted to hear, and Sands, to be fair, described how a rights issue can be avoided. Some $1.8bn of costs are being removed and the asset base is being derisked, thus there is a credible target to improve the core capital ratio from 10.7% to 11%-12% this year.</p> <p>But Sands will be chief executive only until June. Is Bill Winters, the new boss, tied by the same strategy? \u201cWe didn\u2019t have time to wait for Bill,\u201d said Halford. \u201cIt\u2019s full pedal to the floor.\u201d</p> <p>That was a diplomatic answer. Sands\u2019 final revving of the engine is commendable as far as it goes, but the reality is that all is uncertain until Winters has looked under the bonnet.</p> <h2>Ups beat downs at ITV</h2> <p>It\u2019s hard to find fault in ITV\u2019s fifth year in a row of double-digit profit increases, but let\u2019s try. Share of viewing was down 5% in 2014. ITV Studios, the production division, saw a 4% fall in revenues in the UK on an \u201corganic\u201d basis. And aren\u2019t those big entertainment formats \u2013 the likes of I\u2019m a Celebrity and Ant and Dec\u2019s Saturday Night Takeaway \u2013 looking a little long in the tooth?</p> <p>But that\u2019s about as far as the nit-picking goes after a 23% rise in pre-tax profits to \u00a3712m. Indeed, there are semi-explanations on the points above. On viewing, ITV merely gave back what it gained in 2013 under pressure from a strong BBC. Studios in the UK were affected by a year of World Cup football but the overseas revenues still motored. And those old formats still get good audiences and still sell overseas; even the Australians are taking Celebrity, although it is filmed in South Africa, oddly.</p> <p>In other words, ITV\u2019s remarkable progress continues. One of chief executive Adam Crozier\u2019s challenges is how to distribute the winnings. For the third year in a row there is a special dividend (worth \u00a3250m this time) on top of an ordinary that was lifted by a third with the promise of increases of at least 20% in the next two years.</p> <p>The series of specials has not strained the balance sheet. Far from it. There was net cash at the year-end of \u00a341m, even after spending \u00a3214m on acquisitions. ITV even finds itself wanting more balance sheet \u201cleverage\u201d \u2013 meaning debt \u2013 in the interests of financial efficiency.</p> <p>Don\u2019t expect fireworks, however. The leverage will arrive \u201cgradually\u201d and Crozier reserves the right to tweak the mix between acquisitions and special dividends as he wishes. Talks with Talpa, the Dutch production company behind The Voice, continue, for example.</p> <p>The only real cloud is that audience share figure. For now, though, it\u2019s having little impact on advertising revenues, probably because ITV maintains a stranglehold on shows with mass audiences on commercial TV. Ad revenues in the first quarter should rise a handy 11%.</p> <p>Liberty Global paid \u00a3481m, or 185p a share, for its 6.4% stake in ITV last July. The share price now is 233p, so that\u2019s a \u00a3125m profit so far. Maybe Liberty\u2019s John Malone wasn\u2019t on the prowl for a bid and just spied an investment opportunity.</p> <h2>Tesco diversity</h2> <p>You don\u2019t have to be a Unilever man to work at Tesco, but it seems to help.

      "bodyText": "The Bank of England\u2019s top regulator has told MPs that bosses at HSBC should take personal responsibility for the scandal at its Swiss private bank, saying he had made it clear to the bank for years that it was too unwieldy to manage. HSBC\u2019s chief executive, Stuart Gulliver, and chairman, Douglas Flint, told the Treasury committee last week that the Swiss revelations had inflicted horrible damage on the bank but refused to take personal responsibility for its failings, including enabling tax evasion. Flint, who was finance director at the time HSBC took over the Swiss business, infuriated members of the committee on Wednesday by blaming the failings on local managers in Switzerland and saying secrecy surrounding Swiss banking made it difficult for him to see what was going on there. Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the Prudential Regulatory Authority, told the Treasury committee: \u201cI find it difficult and frankly inimical to live in a world where there isn\u2019t any allocation of responsibility. We all delegate work but you can\u2019t delegate responsibility.\u201d He said: \u201cIt is very clear to me... that this question of being too complex to manage has to be dealt with. We\u2019ve been very clear with HSBC over a number of years about this. \u201cAs a prudential regulator, we are holding Stuart Gulliver and Douglas Flint responsible for delivering that process. I don\u2019t think they are in any doubt that they as senior management are responsible personally for delivering the change that has to happen. I will hold them responsible, hold their feet to the fire, put their noses to the grindstone, whatever.\u201d Bailey said Gulliver and Flint, who was finance director from 1995 to 2010, were open with the committee about the need to put HSBC right but less clear about where responsibility lay for the Swiss affair. He said it was reasonable to ask who would have been responsible for the Swiss scandal under today\u2019s rules. Lord Stephen Green, chief executive and then chairman of HSBC from 2003 until 2010, has refused to answer questions about the Swiss revelations, published in the Guardian and other news organisations. Bailey said HSBC\u2019s federal organisation had worked well until the bank went on an acquisition spree from the late 1990s onwards. Under the chairmanship of Sir John Bond, HSBC bought Republic National Bank of New York together with its scandal-hit Swiss arm; Bital, a Mexican bank that was used by drugs gangs to launder money; and Household, the subprime lender whose losses cost HSBC billions of pounds. \u201cThey grew by acquisition very rapidly from the late 1990s to 2002-2003 time. It was contrary to the culture, bringing things in, and it was at odds with the federal structure,\u201d Bailey said.",

      "bodyText": "Shoppers across the eurozone went on a new year spending spree in January, raising hopes that the 19-member single currency area is bouncing back from the brink of a deflationary downturn. Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank (ECB), announced in January he would start a \u20ac60bn ($43bn)-a-month programme of quantitative easing in a bid to prevent the eurozone sliding into deflation, with the money due to start flowing this month. But with plunging petrol prices providing a boost to consumers\u2019 spending power and the weakness of the euro against the dollar helping exporters, there are hopes a recovery may already be under way. Retail sales across the eurozone expanded by 1.1% in January, according to official figures, beating investors\u2019 forecasts by a wide margin. Compared with year earlier, sales were 3.7% higher. A separate survey of eurozone businesses showed that output in the key services sector expanded strongly last month. \u201cThere were clear signs of the eurozone economy reviving in February, with stronger inflows of new business and rising business confidence suggesting growth should continue to pick up in March,\u201d said Chris Williamson, chief economist at data provider Markit. Markit\u2019s monthly purchasing managers index for services hit a seven-month high, of 53.7, well above the 50 mark that signals expansion. The composite index, which covers both services and manufacturing, hit 53.3 in February, pointing to the fastest economic growth since July last year. Williamson said Ireland and Spain were showing the strongest expansion; but all of the \u201cbig four\u201d eurozone economies \u2013 Germany, France, Spain and Italy \u2013 were registering growth. However, the breakdown of the official retail sales figures revealed sharp differences between countries. Consumers in bailed-out Portugal led the way with a 6.8% monthly rise in sales volumes; Germany saw a 2.9% increase in sales; Lithuania, Bulgaria and Ireland suffered declines. Draghi is expected to announce the details of how it will carry out its \u20ac60bn-a-month bond-buying programme at a press conference after the ECB\u2019s monthly policy meeting in Cyprus on Thursday. Draghi will also reveal the ECB\u2019s latest forecasts for inflation and GDP growth. QE could start as soon as next week. The controversial policy, which has been openly opposed by the German Bundesbank president, Jens Weidmann, is aimed at underpinning confidence and boosting asset prices. After the radical Greek government secured a four-month agreement to extend its bailout loan, companies may also feel more confident about investing. Williamson said: \u201cConcerns about \u2018Grexit\u2019 and contagion to other countries have eased, the weaker euro should help boost exports and, perhaps most importantly, the commencement of quantitative easing by the ECB should stimulate the economy as we move through the year.\u201d However, fears that Greece may run out of money were kept alive on Wednesday when the Spanish economy minister, Luis de Guindos, repeated his claim that Athens would eventually need a third emergency rescue. \u201cWe have given ourselves these four months to one, see what the real situation is, to see how Greece has met conditions and to try and establish what happens next ... which is fundamentally a third rescue,\u201d he told a conference in Barcelona. Eurozone finance ministers are due to meet next Monday, but a spokeswoman for the eurogroup chief, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, insisted that finance ministers were not discussing a third bailout. One key impact of the announcement of QE has been to weaken the euro on foreign exchanges. In a separate report published on Wednesday, ratings agency Moody\u2019s pointed to a number of sectors that it predicts will receive a boost from the cheaper currency. \u201cContinental automakers like BMW and Daimler with cheaper European cost bases and high non-European sales could see a benefit from the euro slide, while hotels and tourist companies enjoy more overseas visitors. On the other hand, airlines could bear the brunt with fewer people choosing to travel outside Europe,\u201d said Anke Rindermann, Moody\u2019s vice president and senior analyst.",

    "webTitle": "Spain insists Greece will need a third bailout - as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Before closing up for the day, here is a summary of the main events. Spain\u2019s economy minister has seriously ruffled eurozone feathers by suggesting a third Greek bailout is inevitable His comments put pressure on other ministers to respond to the suggestion. Germany\u2019s Angela Merkel said the focus should be on the current bailout The latest PMI surveys suggested the eurozone is on track to grow by about 0.3% in the first quarter UK services sector growth slowed in February but was strong nevertheless Eurozone consumers went out and shopped in January, triggering an unexpected surge in retail sales Greece pushed through a \u20ac1.138bn (\u00a3825m) T-bills sale In the US the ADP jobs numbers disappointed, but the ISM non-manufacturing PMI survey came in stronger than expected George Osborne won a significant victory in Europe Thank you, as always, for reading the blog today and for commenting. Have a good evening, and do come back tomorrow. AM George Osborne has secured a major victory over the European Central Bank after a court ruled that clearing houses should not be forced to move from London to the eurozone. The ruling by the general court of the EU is significant for the City of London and it\u2019s status as a major financial centre. The ECB had argued that clearing houses such as LCH Clearnet, which step in between major banks and financial firms on big deals to guarantee the transactions, should be based in the eurozone as they handle euro-denominated deals. Jill Treanor has been busy today and writes: The chancellor took action against the ECB in 2011 and this decision is the first time a European court has ruled in his favour on a significant case. The general court of the EU ruled that the ECB did not have the power to demand such a move. \u201cThis is a major win for Britain and a major win for all those who want to see a European economy that is both open and successful,\u201d said Osborne. The European court did not scrutinise the legal argument put forward by the UK that the ECB was discriminating against a member country, as it concluded that the ECB did not have the power to make a decision in the first place. \u201cWe have been consistently clear there needs to be a level playing field for all countries in Europe\u2019s single market, whether they are in the eurozone or not. That\u2019s why we brought a legal challenge against the European Central Bank\u2019s utterly discriminatory location policy, and why we welcome today\u2019s ruling from the European court of justice which strikes this policy down,\u201d Osborne said. The decision comes weeks before the general election on 7 May. If Osborne\u2019s Conservative party wins, it has promised to hold an in-out referendum on continued membership of the EU \u2013 which has worried many business leaders. Yet experts said the ruling made a \u201cBrexit\u201d less likely. \u201cIf the ruling had gone against the UK it would have seriously undermined the single market and significantly increased the power of the ECB \u2013 and probably would have made \u2018Brexit\u2019 more likely,\u201d said the thinktank Open Europe. Andrew Bailey, a deputy governor at the Bank of England responsible for prudential regulation has been giving evidence to House of Commons Treasury Select Committee. He has told MPs that HSBC\u2019s chief executive and chairman will be held \u201cpersonally responsible\u201d for making the scandal hit bank less complicated. I am going to hold their feet to the fire, noses to the grindstone. Bailey has also told the committee that no banks have come to him asking for advice on a British exit from the EU. In a separate development, the Bank of England is at odds with Europe over the bonus cap. As the Guardian\u2019s Jill Treanor reports: The Bank of England remained on collision course with Europe over the bonus cap as a consultation was launched that would rule out the use of top-up payments to side step the clampdown on City pay. The European Banking Authority ruled in Ocotober that these extra payments should be regarded as variable components of pay, like a bonus, and that banks using them are breaching the ratio set out by the EU to limit bonuses to one times salary or twice if shareholders if approve. The pan-European banking regulator has begun a three-month consultation that would turn this opinion into formal guidelines. All banking regulators in the EU would then have to comply or risk being taken to the European court of justice. But the Bank of England\u2019s Andrew Bailey has spoken out against the bonus cap, saying it forces up fixed pay. There is no evidence that his views have changed. The UK\u2019s major banks are among those using these allowances as third payments alongside salaries and bonuses. European markets are mainly up this afternoon. FTSE 100: flat at 6,889.88 Germany\u2019s DAX: +0.3% at 11316.57 France\u2019s CAC: +0.5% at 4893.9 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: +0.3% at 22051.4 Spain\u2019s IBEX: -0.2% at 10,997 More US data. In contrast to the earlier ADP jobs numbers, the ISM non-manufacturing PMI survey came in stronger than expected, at 56.9 in February. Economists polled by Reuters were forecasting 56.5, following 56.7 in January. Over in Athens, Guardian correspondent Helena Smith reports that EU commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker has caused a stir with comments made to Spanish newspaper El Pais. Helena writes: There are some long faces among officials in Syriza after EU commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker warned that Greece\u2019s new prime minister should tell voters he will never be able to fulfil the promises he has made to them. Juncker appears increasingly to be taking the carrot and stick approach to Greece. When he met the young Alexis Tsipras in Brussels last month, he took the new leader by the hand welcoming him profusively to the European family. But in an interview with the Spanish daily El Pais today he took an altogether new line, speaking bluntly about the need for Tsipras to come clean with Greeks over his inability to stick with the anti-austerity programme he had pledged to them. \u201cHe must explain that some of the promises upon which he was elected will not be honoured,\u201d Juncker told the paper. \u201cThe elections don\u2019t change the EU treaties. We could be more flexible, but Tsipras\u2019 victory doesn\u2019t give him the right to change everything.\u201d Syriza isn\u2019t commenting on it - officially, yet - but insiders are clearly upset. Juncker, a self-declared philhellene who has frequently said Greece will never leave the eurozone under his stewardship, is widely seen as Athens\u2019 greatest ally. \u201cWe are learning to take the criticism on the chin but it still hurts,\u201d said one. Wall Street has opened down following those disappointing ADP jobs numbers. Dow Jones: -0.7% at 18,066.39 S&amp;P 500: -0.4% at 2,098.62 Nasdaq: -0.7% at 4,428.12 Spain\u2019s economy minister Luis de Guindos has set the cat among the pigeons with his comment that Greece will need a third bailout. German chancellor Angela Merkel and EU commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker have been forced to bat away suggestions of another rescue at a press conference in Brussels. Merkel: I think we now have all our hands full to make this [second Greek bailout] succeed. Juncker: We are going to focus on implementing what was agreed in the eurogroup. It is premature to talk about a third programme. That is speculation that is best avoided. Something tells me de Guindos might be in the dog house at Monday\u2019s meeting... Over in the US, the ADP jobs report has disappointed expectations. Private sector employers created 212,000 jobs in February, lower than the 220,000 forecast in a Reuters poll. The figure for January was revised up however, to 250,000 jobs from 213,000 jobs. Paul Dales, senior US economist at Capital Economics said the disappointing number for February did not necessarily mean the closely watched non-farm payroll figures would be similarly disappointing on Friday. The 212,000 rise in US ADP private employment in February, down from 250,000 in January, suggests that the risk to our forecast that official payrolls rose by 230,000 are tilted towards the downside. This survey isn\u2019t reliable enough, however, to lead us to revise our forecast. In recent months ADP\u2019s initial estimate has underestimated the increase in official payrolls. Admittedly, in months when the weather has been worse than normal, the ADP survey usually overestimates payrolls. This is because while workers only make it into the official payroll count if they were paid in the working week containing the 12th of the month, they are still recorded as employed by the ADP if weren\u2019t paid. The harsh weather in recent weeks therefore means there is a chance that the official payrolls figure will be lower than the ADP reading. But since the weather wasn\u2019t too bad in the week containing the 12th February, we think this risk is small. We\u2019re sticking with our forecast that official payrolls rose by a healthy 230,000 last month. Eurozone finance ministers will not be discussing a third rescue package for Greece when then meet on Monday, a spokesman for the German finance ministry has said. A discussion about a third bailout package for Greece is not on the agenda for the eurogroup meeting on Monday. Not that anyone has actually said it will be on the agenda at Monday\u2019s meeting ... but Spain\u2019s economy minister Luis de Guindos said earlier today that ultimately, Greece will need a third bailout. Germany is clearly keen to play down the prospect of another Greek rescue, which would not be a popular prospect in Europe\u2019s largest economy. Greek PM Alexis Tsipras is drumming up some publicity ahead of next week\u2019s eurogroup meeting: Back in the UK, the outgoing chief executive of Standard Chartered has described a 30% slide in profits as \u201cclearly disappointing\u201d. Peter Sands is waiving his bonus for 2014 and the bank has announced plans to further cut costs. Shares in the bank are up 3.7% this afternoon, on the news that Standard Bank did not cut the dividend. The Guardian\u2019s Jill Treanor reports: Profits fell to $4.2bn (\u00a32.7bn) \u2013 due in part to a 32% rise in bad debt charges, extra compliance costs, a $300m (\u00a3196m) fine from the US authorities for breaches of money-laundering rules and continuing problems with its Korean arm. The emerging markets-focused bank issued its results after last week\u2019s dramatic boardroom clearout which will also see the chairman, Sir John Peace, and four other directors leave. After 13 years at the bank, Sands moved to allay fears that it needed to embark on a major fundraising exercise to bolster its capital levels and said that despite the fall in profits, the bank held its dividend at last year\u2019s level of 82 cents a share. Sands and four other executive directors on the board will forgo their bonuses, but Andy Halford, who became finance director in August, will take his payout. Details will be released on 16 March and Sands said the size of payments was irrelevant. He declared that the executive directors were not taking bonuses in order to \u201cshow leadership\u201d. However, the total bonus pool is only down 9% \u2013 less than the fall in overall profits. Sands said 98% of Standard staff were based outside the UK and working in markets where they risked being poached by rivals. Read the full story here. Greece could learn a thing or two from Ireland, according to Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny. Ireland left its bailout package behind in 2013 and has been hailed as a poster-child for reform and economic recovery. Speaking to CNBC on the sidelines of a conference in Dublin, Kenny said Ireland had gone beyond the demands of its creditors. For Greece, there\u2019s a lesson from Ireland. Obviously, we respect and understand the difficulties that apply in Greece from a humanitarian point of view. Greece needs time and space and Europe is giving Greece that time and space. We didn\u2019t stick by the rules in the sense that we built a relationship with the troika and actually made better propositions than they were making themselves. We made progress. Now, we\u2019re able to buy out the IMF loans and borrow money in the international markets at historically low rates. Difficult though it has been for our country, the benefits are starting to be seen after a four-year period. I\u2019ve said that to the Greek prime minister myself - here\u2019s a lesson from one small country that you can take some reflection on in terms of building your own economy for the future. Spain\u2019s economy minister is happily wading in on the Greek debate again today after getting in to a bit of hot water earlier in the week. Luis de Guindos is sticking to his guns, repeating his comment that Greece will need a third rescue in the region of \u20ac30-50bn. De Guindos told a conference in Barcelona that Europe would use the four-month bailout extension secured by Greece to assess what progress has been made, and what the next move should be. We have given ourselves these four months to one, see what the real situation is, to see how Greece has met conditions and to try and establish what happens next ... which is fundamentally a third rescue. He added that ministers at next week\u2019s eurogroup meeting would consider Greece\u2019s liquidity needs and debt maturities. De Guindos comment earlier in the week that the eurozone was working on a third rescue package for Greece ruffled a few feathers. In response, a spokeswoman for eurogroup chief Jeroen Dijsselbloem insisted that finance ministers were not discussing a third bailout. Athens has managed to sell \u20ac1.138bn (\u00a3825m) of six-month Treasury bills, allowing it to refinance a maturing issue. It was a test of the county\u2019s ability to raise funds as at critical time for Greece. It passed the test, but the funds came at a higher cost. At 2.97%, the yield was up from 2.75% in a previous sale in February. Consumers in the eurozone did their bit to boost the flagging economy in January. The volume of retail sales jumped 1.1% in the single currency bloc in January compared with December according to statistics office Eurostat. It was a much bigger increase than the 0.1% growth predicted by economists. The bumper month pushed the annual rate of growth in sales to 3.7%, again much stronger than the 1.9% forecast. Yesterday\u2019s surprisingly strong number out of Germany had given a hint the eurozone figures would be good, but it\u2019s welcome nevertheless. The strongest growth in retail sales in January was in Portugal (+6.8%) and Germany (+2.9%). More reaction to the UK services PMI now, which revealed a slight slowdown in growth in February. The detail of the survey was more positive than the headline number suggested, with employment, new business and optimism among firms all up at a stronger rate than January. Vicky Redwood, chief UK economist at Capital Economics: The slight deterioration in February\u2019s CIPS/Markit report on services is a bit of a disappointment, but hardly a disaster. Contrary to expectations of a rise, the headline business activity index dipped from 57.2 in January to 56.7. But this reversed only part of the previous month\u2019s rise and left the index still consistent with decent quarterly growth of services output of just below 1%. And the drop looks likely to be temporary, given that the new business, business expectations and employment indices all rose. What\u2019s more, there has been plenty of other evidence that the economic recovery has been gaining pace again, such as the rises in February\u2019s manufacturing and construction PMIs already released. Rob Wood, chief UK economist at Berenberg bank: Despite a small dip, the UK services PMI points to strong growth. The services PMI fell to 56.7 in February from 57.2, below consensus expectations for a rise. Some correction had been on the cards given the large jump in the index last month, so it is hardly anything to start worrying about or pinning \u2018UK slowing\u2019 statements on. At 56.7, the survey continues to point to strong, probably above trend growth. That reading is above the pre-crisis average, pointing to a rapid pace of expansion. Notwithstanding today\u2019s headline disappointment on the PMI, the economy seems to be growing faster and tightening more than the Bank of England had factored in. For that reason, we look for the first BoE rate hike in Feb 2016 and we expect them to hike rates faster than the market expects, with rates reaching 1.5% by the end of 2016, which would still be an extremely low level and supportive of growth. Jeremy Cook, chief economist at World First: Data from the UK services sector remained solid in February and continues the belief that any dip in fortunes seen towards the end of last year was merely a blip. The services sector continues to add jobs, with February\u2019s additions coming at the second highest rate on record. Higher wages are also being seen for sector participants which is a necessary and welcome reaction to tightness in the labour market and competition between companies. This competition is also helping rebuild inflation - albeit slowly - within the sector. Should this continue, then the pressure on the Bank of England to raise rates will only increase from the UK\u2019s largest and most valuable sector. Taking the recent run of PMIs together, Q1 GDP is forecasted at 0.6% with potential for an upside surprise. Continued growth in the UK services sector - accounting for three quarters of the economy - suggests the chancellor is not in store for a nasty shock in the run-up to the election. According to Markit, it puts the economy on course for solid growth of 0.6% in the first quarter, following 0.5% growth in the fourth quarter of 2014. The first estimate of first-quarter growth will be published by the Office for National Statistics on 28 April. At that point there will only be a little over a week until the general election - nice timing for George Osborne to shout about accelerating growth (and that long-term economic plan of his). The Markit/CIPS PMI survey for the UK has disappointed City forecasts. The headline index came in at 56.7 in February, down from 57.2 in January. But with anything above 50 signalling growth, it is still a pretty decent result. The detail of the February composite services PMI for the eurozone shows that bailout countries Spain and Ireland continue to enjoy the fastest expansion. Ireland: 60.7 Spain: 56 Germany: 53.8 Eurozone: 53.3 France: 52.2 Italy: 51 Howard Archer, chief European economist at IHS Global Insight, says a number of factors are helping to breathe some life into the eurozone\u2019s stuttering economy. The much more competitive euro, sharply reduced oil prices and ECB stimulus seems to be increasingly fostering a more favourable growth environment, and it is notable that overall business and consumer confidence across the eurozone rose for a second successive month in February to be at seven-month high. The marked retreat in the euro to recently hit an 11-year low of US$1.1098 is very helpful for eurozone competitiveness and growth prospects while much reduced oil prices are helping companies\u2019 margins as well as consumers\u2019 purchasing power. Furthermore, markedly lower oil prices should be helpful overall to global growth prospects, which would benefit eurozone exports in tandem with the weaker euro. The eurozone services sector PMI increased to 53.7 in February from 52.7 in January. Markit\u2019s composite PMI for the eurozone - measuring services and manufacturing activity across the region - indicates the fastest economic growth in seven months in February. The composite headline index increased to 53.7 in February from 52.7 in January. Markit\u2019s chief economist Chris Williamson says this puts the eurozone economy on course for 0.3% growth in the first quarter. The remaining eurozone services PMI\u2019s are starting to roll in and reveal mixed fortunes. Headline indices: Italy drops to 50 in February from 51.2 in January France rises to 53.4 in February from 49.4 in January Germany rises to 54.7 in February from 54 in January Investors across Europe have a spring in their step this morning, with all major indices up slightly. FTSE 100: +0.1 at 6,897 Germany\u2019s DAX: +0.2% at 11,308.95 France\u2019s CAC : +0.6% at 4,897.36 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: +0.2% at 22,024.76 Spain\u2019s IBEX: +0.5% at 11,068.4 Greece\u2019s ATG index is up 0.4% at 864.99. Bosses at Standard Chartered have revealed they will not take a bonus following a sharp fall in profits at the Bank last year. Shares have jumped in early trading despite the profit fall, as the dividend was held at the 2013 level rather than cut. It is top of the FTSE 100 leader board, up 5%. Last week Standard Chartered revealed a boardroom clearout, with the chairman, chief executive, and four other directors heading for the door. (Read our full story here). We will have more on the results soon. The detail of Markit\u2019s Spanish services PMI survey shows that despite the drop in the headline number, there were some positives. New orders rose at the fastest pace in seven months, while jobs in the sector were created at the fastest rate since November 2007, before the eurozone\u2019s meltdown. Andrew Harker, senior economist at Markit and author of the report said: The Spanish service sector maintained its recent run of growth in February, and there were several causes for optimism within the underlying data. Companies took on extra staff at a solid pace, and one that was the strongest since November 2007. Moreover, business sentiment improved to the highest in 11 years, signalling that companies expect recent growth to be sustained in the near- term at least. Chris Williamson, Markit\u2019s chief economist, said the survey suggested the Spanish economy overall is on course for growth of 0.7% in the first quarter. The headline index measuring acticvity in Spain\u2019s services sector fell to 56.2 in February from 56.7 in January. It\u2019s not a big fall, and still indicates the sector is growing (anything above 50), but the number is lower than economists were forecasting. Meanwhile overnight in China, the HSBC/Markit services PMI suggested activity grew modestly in February. New orders rose at the fastest pace in three months. The headline index picked up to 52 from 51.8, where anything above 50 indicates expansion, so no horror stories there. Concerns over the health of the world\u2019s second largest economy persist however, after growth in 2014 of 7.4% was the slowest in 24 years. A further slowdown to about 7% growth is expected this year. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial market, the eurozone, and business. The main data out this morning are the February services PMI surveys from around Europe. Spain will get us out of the blocks at 8.15am (UK time), followed by Italy, France, Germany and the eurozone overall. At 10am, we will get January\u2019s eurozone retail sales figures, which follow surprisingly strong numbers from Germany yesterday. Michael Hewson, chief market analysts at CMC Markets, is optimistic: We have seen some silver linings in this week\u2019s European economic data so far and today\u2019s services data could well add to those with improvements expected in the latest Spain, Italy, France and Germany services PMI\u2019s for February. In the wake of yesterday\u2019s blow out German retail sales numbers, we are expecting a similarly positive improvement from the broader eurozone January retail sales numbers as well, with a rise of 2.5% expected. At 9.30am Markit will publish the UK services PMI, and markets will be looking for a strong performance for a sector that accounts for about three quarters of the UK economy. Later on in the US we have the latest ADP employment survey and ISM non-manufacturing index. And of course, we will bring you all the latest developments from Greece, ahead of next week\u2019s eurogroup meeting.",

The services PMI fell to 56.7 in February from 57.2, below consensus expectations for a rise. Some correction had been on the cards given the large jump in the index last month, so it is hardly anything to start worrying about or pinning \u2018UK slowing\u2019 statements on. </p> <p>At 56.7, the survey continues to point to strong, probably above trend growth. That reading is above the pre-crisis average, pointing to a rapid pace of expansion. </p> <p>Notwithstanding today\u2019s headline disappointment on the PMI, the economy seems to be growing faster and tightening more than the Bank of England had factored in.

      "bodyText": "High street baker Greggs has reported a 41% rise in annual profits after coming up with a successful recipe of meal deals, sandwiches and soups. In the first 12 months of a five-year plan to revamp the Newcastle pasty and sausage roll-maker, profits excluding tax and one-off items climbed to \u00a358.3m, with like-for-like sales up 4.5%. The company\u2019s new chief executive, Roger Whiteside, is remodelling the company as a coffee shop chain, with renovated stores offering extra seating and healthier products. It now sells \u00a31m of coffee a week after unveiling a smoother blend a year ago, while offering sandwiches containing fewer than 400 calories and less salt and sugar.

Household spending power has risen owing to a big drop in inflation and a steady fall in unemployment, the thinktank said.

CBI director-general John Cridland says the UK\u2019s equivalent of Germany\u2019s widely praised group of companies known as the Mittelstand, are the \u201cbackbone of the UK economy\u201d and should be allowed to grow further with investment support, export help and a simpler tax system. The CBI\u2019s big requests from the 18 March budget include: \u00b7 Greater availability of long-term growth capital with a market for privately placed debt. \u00b7 More to encourage wider research and development (R&amp;D) activity, by enhancing the R&amp;D tax credit to include the final manufacturing of prototypes. \u00b7 A commitment to reduce the supplementary charge on North Sea oil producers. \u00b7 Free childcare (currently 15 hours) extended to one- and two-year-olds \u201cif funds are available\u201d. Cridland commented: This is a good opportunity for the chancellor before the election to support growth and investment well beyond the election, providing stability, certainty and simplicity for the UK\u2019s Mittelstand to get themselves on the front foot. \u201cSo the chancellor must reward growing, ambitious firms with the tools to get on with the job of rebalancing the economy and lift productivity. There has been good progress on this front from the government, and the chancellor can now take further action to boost investment and innovation.\u201d On R&amp;D, Cridland added: Innovation is fundamental to long-term growth and creating more high-skilled jobs in the economy. If we want to really get the full benefit of the great work going on in labs and workshops up and down the country, we need to encourage more firms to build their prototypes here in the UK. There is a growing pattern of re-shoring production back home and a super-charged tax credit could help keep that ball rolling. The CBI is calling for a fiscally neutral budget, expecting further austerity to pay for any extra help for business. The business group said its package costs \u00a30.6bn in 2015-16, before rising to \u00a31.6bn in 2019/20 \u2013 excluding the cost of the childcare proposals. \u201cThese policies should be funded through efficiency savings in the short run and reform of public services over the course of the next parliament,\u201d it said.

The sale price is higher than was expected when the government announced that it was inviting offers for its stake, in October 2014. George Osborne described it as a \u201cfantastic deal for UK taxpayers that exceeds expectations\u201d. The government has agreed to sell its 40% stake in the profit-making rail service for \u00a3585m to a consortium of the Canadian institutional investor Caisse de d\u00e9p\u00f4t et placement du Qu\u00e9bec (CDPQ) and UK based Hermes Infrastructure. Eurostar has also agreed, as part of the sale of the government stake, to redeem the Treasury\u2019s preference share, providing a further \u00a3172m to the UK taxpayer. French and Belgian railway firms SNCF and SNCB are retaining their stake in Eurostar and still have the option to buy the UK government\u2019s 40% stake for a 15% premium to the agreed price. They have 20 business days to decide whether to exercise the option, but are not expected to do so.The French are already partners with the Canadian pension fund in a separate rail venture. Ministers said the sale price is significantly ahead of expectations and reflects the value of the asset. Competition for the UK share had included the private equity firm 3i and Predica, a division of French bank Credit Agricole. Ministers are trying to secure \u00a320bn from corporate and financial asset sales by 2020, and believe the Eurostar sale can be complete by the second quarter of this year. Since services began in 1994, Eurostar has carried more than 150 million passengers, with over 10 million in 2014 alone, while sustaining traffic growth every year for the past decade. La Caisse de d\u00e9p\u00f4t et placement du Qu\u00e9bec is a long-term institutional investor that manages funds primarily for 33 public and pension and insurance plans.
