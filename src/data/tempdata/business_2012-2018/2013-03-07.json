      "bodyText": "The US's top aviation safety investigator is to hold hearings on the safety of lithium-ion batteries similar to those used in Boeing's now grounded 787 Dreamliner jets. The hearings are likely to put more pressure on Boeing as it fights to get its jets back in the air. Transport secretary Ray LaHood has said plans to fix its battery issues will face \"a lot of questions\". On Thursday, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) released its interim report into the fire that broke out in the battery of a 787 parked at Boston's Logan airport in January. Releasing the findings, Deborah Hersman, the NTSB chairman, said she planned to hold a meeting next month to explore lithium-ion battery technology and transport safety. It would help the industry \"better understand the risks and benefits associated with lithium batteries, and illuminate how manufacturers and regulators evaluate the safety of new technology,\" Hersman said. She has already criticised the certification process for the battery. \"The expectation in aviation is to never experience a fire aboard an aircraft,\" she said in January. Robert Mann, founder of consultant RW Mann, said: \"It's pretty tough to come up with a solution if you haven't found the cause.\" He said the investigation could now widen beyond the battery. Mann said that the cargo industry had serious concerns about lithium-ion technology and was likely to raise those concerns at the NTSB meeting. A fatal fire broke out on UPS flight in Dubai in 2008 that had been carrying large quantities of lithium ion batteries. Lithium-ion batteries have caused fires in cars, computers and mobile phones as well as small aircraft. The Dreamliner is the first large passenger jet to use the lightweight technology on such a scale. As well as the Boston fire, a battery in an All Nippon Airways 787 set off a smoke alarm while in flight, triggering an emergency landing. That incident is now being investigated by Japanese authorities. The delays to 787 deliveries led Boeing rival Airbus to ditch plans to use lithium-ion batteries on its wide-body jet, the A350-XWB.The 499-page report is the most detailed yet into what went wrong. The NTSB report makes clear it has yet to find a root cause for the fire. The board is still early in the investigation into the cause of the blaze on the Boston battery and experts said investigators may never determine a root cause because the battery was so badly burned. \"With the grounding of the 787 fleet, concurrent international incident investigations, redesign and re-certification activities taking place simultaneously, it is essential to provide the aviation community, policy makers and the public with the factual information we are developing,\" said Hersman. \"Releasing an interim report provides a window into the significant investigative work that has been accomplished so far.\" Boeing had delivered just 50 of its Dreamliner jets when the issue emerged and faces penalties if future deliveries are not made on time. It delivered a plan to address the battery issues to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on 22 February. That plan is believed to involve a stronger casing for the batteries, reinforced separation between its eight cells and a venting system that would direct potentially hazardous gases outside the jet. LaHood told the Wall Street Journal that Boeing's plans would come under intense scrutiny. \"I have made it very clear that I want a thorough review\" of the Boeing plan, LaHood said. \"I am going to ask a lot of questions\" before a final decision is made.",

      "bodyText": "The John Lewis retail chain has handed its 84,700 staff an annual bonus worth 17% of their salary \u2013 the equivalent of nine weeks' pay \u2013 as the employee-owned company continues to outperform its rivals. Staff at John Lewis's Oxford Street store whooped and clapped as the better-than-expected bonus \u2013 which is handed to all employees, from cashiers to chairman Charlie Mayfield \u2013 was revealed on Thursday against a gloomy backdrop for some other retailers. The bonus for an employee on average salary would be \u00a34,000. But the John Lewis Partnership warned it was reviewing its pension, one of the few non-contributory final-salary schemes left in the country. It said: \"During the next year the partnership will be undertaking a review of the pension scheme to ensure that it can remain fair to partners and sustainable from a business perspective.\" The \u00a3210.8m bonus payout, up from \u00a3165.2m last year, followed a 9.1% rise in sales to \u00a38.47bn. Profits for the group, which owns the Waitrose supermarket chain as well as 39 department stores, were up 15.8% on last year to \u00a3409.6m, before accounting for tax and the bonus. The latest burst of growth brings the partnership within a whisker of Marks &amp; Spencer's UK sales of \u00a38.9bn for the year to March 2012. A big part of that growth came online, with sales up 40.8% at Johnlewis.com. Waitrose's online business rose 49%, compared with 19% for the grocery market as a whole. Both the group's chains have gained market share over the year. Natalie Jempeji, section manager in lingerie at John Lewis Oxford Street, said: \"It's a bit more than I was expecting so I'm happy with that. I'm going to spend the money on a holiday to Turkey for my birthday later in the year.\" George Young, section manager of furnishing fabrics, who has been in the partnership for 45 years and helped open the outsized envelope containing the bonus figure, said: \"This is the last bonus before I retire. I'm going to take my wife to Cornwall to enjoy a nice holiday that will set me up for retirement.\" The company said it had reaped the benefit from its investment in technology and lower prices, as well as shoppers' trust in its brands during the horsemeat scandal and tough times on the high street that have seen the demise of rivals. Mayfield, whose most recently disclosed salary was \u00a3825,000, said: \"These results have been achieved against a market that remains subdued, but we believe the market is stabilising and there are some opportunities out there.\" The chairman added that the outlook for the economy was becoming clearer as fears about the collapse of the eurozone subsided. This year, John Lewis will be investing over \u00a3200m, more than ever before, in store refurbishments, a new warehouse and future stores, although no new outlets will open this year. Waitrose, meanwhile, is planning to open 20 stores this year and a new distribution centre in Lancashire to support growth in the north of England and Scotland. The two sides of the partnership will also be looking at more ways to work closer together after launching a service that allows shoppers to pick up goods ordered at Johnlewis.com at Waitrose stores. Andrew Murphy, director of retail operations, said the group would be opening another Waitrose inside a John Lewis, as it has done in Oxford Street and Bluewater, and was looking for at least two more sites where John Lewis and Waitrose could open neighbouring stores. In Ipswich, where such co-location is already operating, sales are running 30% above expectations four months after the stores opened. Neil Saunders, managing director of retail analyst Conlumino, said: \"One of the most impressive features of John Lewis over the past year has been its ability to keep many plates spinning simultaneously. The pace and quality of innovation and initiatives has been extremely strong and is one of the central reasons for its outperformance.\" A 29% surge in sales of electrical goods such as iPads and TVs boosted sales at John Lewis last year as major high street rival Comet collapsed. Waitrose saw its market share rise from 4.7% to 4.9% after it opened 19 new stores and promised to match Tesco's prices on branded goods and expanded its Essential range of low-price basic foods. Mark Price, managing director of Waitrose, said the chain's prices were now on average 1% cheaper than Sainsbury's. He said the Little Waitrose convenience store chain made a profit for the first time in 2012, its third year in existence, and he plans to open at least 10 more of the small shops this year. Both Waitrose and John Lewis experienced a gradual rise in the pace of growth over the year and that momentum has continued in 2013. Gross sales rose 10.5% in the first five weeks of the year, with like-for likes sales up 13.7% at the department stores and 6.4% at the supermarket compared with the same period in 2012. Overseas plans John Lewis is seeking partnerships with overseas department stores after a successful trial in South Korea. Andy Street, its managing director, said the company wanted relationships with \"other prestigious department stores around the world on a wholesale or licence model\". He said John Lewis had no intention of opening its own stores abroad but is planning dedicated websites in France and Germany this year. It launched a version of its English site in 33 countries in 2011. The Waitrose chain is also expanding abroad. It now has seven licensed shops in the Middle East and plans four more this year. The supermarket's exports rose 20% in 2012 as it expanded into South Korea, Taiwan, Gibraltar and Trinidad, making a total of 30 countries. This year, Waitrose has started delivering to Ibiza and several Caribbean islands.",

    "webTitle": "Seven strange ideas the Bank of England could try to boost growth", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Bank of England resisted pressure to inject billions of pounds into the economy on Thursday, amid mounting speculation that its remit could be changed to encourage policymakers to focus on growth rather than inflation. The monetary policy committee (MPC) voted against expanding its \u00a3375bn quantitative easing (QE) programme and kept interest rates at their historic four-year low of 0.5%. The MPC announcement suggests outgoing bank governor Sir Mervyn King has been outvoted two months running for the first time in his 10 years at the helm of the Bank. At the February MPC meeting, King and two others voted to increase QE by \u00a325bn to \u00a3400bn. Speculation that the arrival of Mark Carneyin the summer to replace King will be accompanied by a broader remit for the MPC has gathered pace since the Canadian central bank chief made it clear he favours adopting unorthodox measures to stimulate growth. The MPC is currently required to keep inflation at 2% over the \"medium term\". This phrase has been interpreted as meaning between two and three years. The committee must also pay regard to employment and growth. The Treasury is currently conducting its annual review of the remit, and it is possible that inflation, which is expected to remain above 2% for the next couple of years, will be de-emphasised in favour of a growth target, in a victory for the \"market monetarists\" \u2013 successors to Milton Friedman who believe that anchoring the market's expectations of long-term interest rates should be the MPC's main aim. For now the committee's main tool is QE and the decision over whether to increase the money-printing has probably been delayed rather than abandoned completely; many predict an expansion of the programme in the next two or three months. Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight said: \"The Bank of England's decision to hold off from stimulative action was highly likely the result of a tightly split vote and we strongly suspect that the MPC will act in the second quarter and very possibly as soon as April.\" Other commentators were wary of any increase. David Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce, said: \"We believe this would be misguided, as more QE would provide only marginal benefits for the real economy, while heightening risks of financial distortions, bubbles and higher inflation.\" But last month the MPC discussed embracing a broader set of policy tools, seven of which are discussed below: Riskier QE The Bank of England has \"printed\" \u00a3375bn of extra money since March 2009 and spent all of it on buying government bonds from banks and insurers in the hope they will lend the proceeds to other private sector companies. The Bank could follow the example of the US Federal Reserve and buy other, more risky, assets, such as home loans. There are commercially traded bundles of mortgages, known as mortgage-backed securities, sitting in bank reserves; the central bank could relieve lenders of these mortgages, allowing them to lend more to ordinary customers. Capital Economics believes that under the current remit QE could rise to \u00a3500bn by the end of next year. A growth target, or a target to achieve a set level of GDP, could accelerate that process. Funding for Lending The Treasury has backed an \u00a380bn scheme that offers high street banks and building societies access to money at 0.5% as long as they lend it to customers at a discounted rate. Some banks, like Barclays, have lent money, while others have stashed the cash \u2013 Royal Bank of Scotland, Lloyds and Santander being the largest. Funding for Lending could be expanded and made even cheaper. Non-deposit-taking lenders could be included. But when only a quarter of the \u00a380bn has so far found its way into the system, it still has some way to go before a top-up is needed. A cut in interest rates A move from 0.5% to 0.25% would mimic the Federal Reserve. Or a 0% rate would create a clear gap between the UK and continental Europe, where base rates are 0.75%. Base rate tracker mortgages would come down in price. However, the suspicion is that most mortgage products would stay the same and the only beneficiary would be the profit margins of high street lenders. Negative interest rates Both Funding for Lending and QE are carrots. A negative interest rate is a big stick. Deputy governor Paul Tucker is tempted to make banks pay to deposit money at the central bank because too many of them are adopting a safety-first policy rather than lending to businesses. Unfortunately, lots of mortgage products track the 0.5% base rate, so if the base rate became -0.5%, banks would be forced to cut the mortgage rate and lose money. Tucker believes it may be possible to apply the -0.5% to some high street bank reserves and set aside the cash that supports existing mortgage lending. Complex and tricky. Working capital instruments Tucker also says that big corporations, which are sitting on piles of unspent profits, could make loans to their suppliers. The loans, which he calls \"working capital instruments\", would support investment by small and medium-sized firms and be underwritten in some form by the central bank. Tucker is looking around for money that businesses can access, which is logical, but maybe small businesses would benefit more from big firms simply paying them on time. Helicopter money Lord Turner, the outgoing chairman of the Financial Services Authority who lost out to Carney in the governor race, has floated the idea of the Bank directly funding the government. The plan would allow chancellor George Osborne to announce multibillion-pound spending on infrastructure projects. Like a helicopter dropping cash from the sky, the central bank would supply the funds rather than the Treasury running up bigger current accounts deficits \u2013 an off-balance-sheet exercise that could keep the ratings agencies at bay. Commercial bills Once there was a thriving commercial bill market, but it died out. It could be revived to provide an avenue for the private sector to access loans. It works like this: two businesses are trading; one owes the other money. The debtor might give the other a bill saying they will pay in three months. This bill can then be traded.",

      "body": "<p>The Bank of England resisted pressure to inject billions of pounds into the economy on Thursday, amid mounting speculation that its remit could be changed to encourage policymakers to focus on growth rather than inflation.</p> <p>The monetary policy committee (MPC) voted against expanding its \u00a3375bn quantitative easing (QE) programme and kept interest rates at their historic four-year low of 0.5%.</p> <p>The MPC announcement suggests outgoing bank governor Sir Mervyn King has been outvoted two months running for the first time in his 10 years at the helm of the Bank. At the February MPC meeting, King and two others voted to increase QE by \u00a325bn to \u00a3400bn.</p> <p>Speculation that the arrival of Mark Carneyin the summer to replace King will be accompanied by a broader remit for the MPC has gathered pace since the Canadian central bank chief made it clear he favours adopting unorthodox measures to stimulate growth.</p> <p>The MPC is currently required to keep inflation at 2% over the \"medium term\". This phrase has been interpreted as meaning between two and three years. The committee must also pay regard to employment and growth.</p> <p>The Treasury is currently conducting its annual review of the remit, and it is possible that inflation, which is expected to remain above 2% for the next couple of years, will be de-emphasised in favour of a growth target, in a victory for the \"market monetarists\" \u2013 successors to Milton Friedman who believe that anchoring the market's expectations of long-term interest rates should be the MPC's main aim.</p> <p>For now the committee's main tool is QE and the decision over whether to increase the money-printing has probably been delayed rather than abandoned completely; many predict an expansion of the programme in the next two or three months.</p> <p>Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight said: \"The Bank of England's decision to hold off from stimulative action was highly likely the result of a tightly split vote and we strongly suspect that the MPC will act in the second quarter and very possibly as soon as April.\"</p> <p>Other commentators were wary of any increase. David Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce, said: \"We believe this would be misguided, as more QE would provide only marginal benefits for the real economy, while heightening risks of financial distortions, bubbles and higher inflation.\"</p> <p>But last month the MPC discussed embracing a broader set of policy tools, seven of which are discussed below:</p> <h2><strong>Riskier QE</strong></h2> <p>The Bank of England has \"printed\" \u00a3375bn of extra money since March 2009 and spent all of it on buying government bonds from banks and insurers in the hope they will lend the proceeds to other private sector companies.</p> <p>The Bank could follow the example of the US Federal Reserve and buy other, more risky, assets, such as home loans. There are commercially traded bundles of mortgages, known as mortgage-backed securities, sitting in bank reserves; the central bank could relieve lenders of these mortgages, allowing them to lend more to ordinary customers. Capital Economics believes that under the current remit QE could rise to \u00a3500bn by the end of next year. A growth target, or a target to achieve a set level of GDP, could accelerate that process.</p> <h2><strong>Funding for Lending</strong></h2> <p>The Treasury has backed an \u00a380bn scheme that offers high street banks and building societies access to money at 0.5% as long as they lend it to customers at a discounted rate. Some banks, like Barclays, have lent money, while others have stashed the cash \u2013 Royal Bank of Scotland, Lloyds and Santander being the largest. Funding for Lending could be expanded and made even cheaper. Non-deposit-taking lenders could be included. But when only a quarter of the \u00a380bn has so far found its way into the system, it still has some way to go before a top-up is needed.</p> <h2><strong>A cut in interest rates</strong></h2> <p>A move from 0.5% to 0.25% would mimic the Federal Reserve. Or a 0% rate would create a clear gap between the UK and continental Europe, where base rates are 0.75%. Base rate tracker mortgages would come down in price. However, the suspicion is that most mortgage products would stay the same and the only beneficiary would be the profit margins of high street lenders.</p> <h2><strong>Negative interest rates</strong></h2> <p>Both Funding for Lending and QE are carrots. A negative interest rate is a big stick. Deputy governor Paul Tucker is tempted to make banks pay to deposit money at the central bank because too many of them are adopting a safety-first policy rather than lending to businesses.</p> <p>Unfortunately, lots of mortgage products track the 0.5% base rate, so if the base rate became -0.5%, banks would be forced to cut the mortgage rate and lose money. Tucker believes it may be possible to apply the -0.5% to some high street bank reserves and set aside the cash that supports existing mortgage lending. Complex and tricky.</p> <h2><strong>Working capital instruments</strong></h2> <p>Tucker also says that big corporations, which are sitting on piles of unspent profits, could make loans to their suppliers. The loans, which he calls \"working capital instruments\", would support investment by small and medium-sized firms and be underwritten in some form by the central bank. Tucker is looking around for money that businesses can access, which is logical, but maybe small businesses would benefit more from big firms simply paying them on time.</p> <h2><strong>Helicopter money</strong></h2> <p>Lord Turner, the outgoing chairman of the Financial Services Authority who lost out to Carney in the governor race, has floated the idea of the Bank directly funding the government. The plan would allow chancellor George Osborne to announce multibillion-pound spending on infrastructure projects. Like a helicopter dropping cash from the sky, the central bank would supply the funds rather than the Treasury running up bigger current accounts deficits \u2013 an off-balance-sheet exercise that could keep the ratings agencies at bay.</p> <h2><strong>Commercial bills</strong></h2> <p>Once there was a thriving commercial bill market, but it died out. It could be revived to provide an avenue for the private sector to access loans. It works like this: two businesses are trading; one owes the other money. The debtor might give the other a bill saying they will pay in three months. This bill can then be traded.</p>",

He went into the election at a time when the economy was deep in recession with an unemployment rate of 11.2% and, most troublingly, a debt to GDP ratio of 126.1%.</p> <p>A populist politician loves statistics like these. He can claim that austerity hasn\u2019t worked and that a new path is needed. He can say he will stand up against Angela Merkel and the rest who are imposing their draconian will on the economy and its people.</p> <p>Nevermind that excessive debts shackle the economy to years of stagnation. People will point to the Japanese experience but <br>Italy\u2019s own history is just as pertinent, if not more. For over a decade, successive governments have tried in vain to <br>stimulate the economy through fiscal policy and all this has achieved is higher debt \u2013 economic growth has remained <br>stubbornly weak. Furthermore, we forget that surging bond yields in 2011 were pushing Italy ever closer to a default <br>and a bailout.</p> <p>Unfortunately, the austerity debate is difficult to couch in black and white terms, which makes it such an easy tool for political gain.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-656feb61-df16-4aa6-a054-64423ff913c6\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/3/7/1362675077684/-460x294.png\" alt=\"Italian 10-year bond yields since January 2011\" width=\"460\" height=\"294\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Photograph: GAM/Bloomberg</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Italian debt have continued to strengthen today, pushing the yield on its 10-year bonds down to 4.6%.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-03-07T16:57:43.615Z\">at 4.57pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5138bfb0b57967939bf515e1\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-03-07T16:26:24.587Z\">4.26pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Greek PM sees fragile recovery</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Greek prime minister <strong>Antonis Samaras</strong> has declared that Greece is finally on the road to recovery.

There's coverage of the Bank of England's decision to leave interest rates and QE unchanged from 12.00pm.... ....and highlights of the ECB press conference from 1.30pm ....with a summary of the key points here. (including new lower eurozone growth forecasts, the fact the ECB considered cutting rates, and Mario Draghi's views on Italy and Cyprus. Thanks, and goodnight. Not a dramatic day on the stock markets. Here are the closing prices: FTSE 100: up 11 points at 6439, +0.18% German DAX: up 20 points at 7937, +0.25% French CAC: up 20 points at 3793, +0.5% Spanish IBEX: up 30 points at 8389, +0.36% Italian FTSE MIB: up 47 points at 15947, + 0.3% Investment management firm GAM has published a research note on Italy that sums up how the austerity debate rebounded on Mario Monti. It also warns that the uncertainty created by last week's general election could derail the eurozone's recovery (which certainly isn't the picture Mario Draghi was trying to paint at today's press conference). You can download it here (pdf) Here's a flavour: The thing with reforms is that the pain is felt now while the benefits are in a hazy and politically unsellable place called the future. Mario Monti inherited an economy heading into recession with an unemployment rate of 8.8% and a debt to GDP ratio of 120.1%. He went into the election at a time when the economy was deep in recession with an unemployment rate of 11.2% and, most troublingly, a debt to GDP ratio of 126.1%. A populist politician loves statistics like these. He can claim that austerity hasn\u2019t worked and that a new path is needed. He can say he will stand up against Angela Merkel and the rest who are imposing their draconian will on the economy and its people. Nevermind that excessive debts shackle the economy to years of stagnation. People will point to the Japanese experience but Italy\u2019s own history is just as pertinent, if not more. For over a decade, successive governments have tried in vain to stimulate the economy through fiscal policy and all this has achieved is higher debt \u2013 economic growth has remained stubbornly weak. Furthermore, we forget that surging bond yields in 2011 were pushing Italy ever closer to a default and a bailout. Unfortunately, the austerity debate is difficult to couch in black and white terms, which makes it such an easy tool for political gain. Italian debt have continued to strengthen today, pushing the yield on its 10-year bonds down to 4.6%. Greek prime minister Antonis Samaras has declared that Greece is finally on the road to recovery. But coalition ally Evangelos Venizelos, who leads the Pasok party, doesn't sound so sure \u2026 Samaras told a meeting of the European People's party (EPP) in Athens that the Greek turnaround was real, but still fragile. As he put it: For the first time since the crisis began, we have the foundations of a success story Of course, we are not out of the woods yet. Our turnaround is very real, but still fragile Samaras was in bullish mood, declaring that his coalition had made more progress on structural reform than any of his predecessors since Greece returned to democracy, adding: A Greek success story will be a relief for Greece and solid proof that the eurozone has the strength, depth and capacity to surpass its worse problems. Reassuring stuff. Except that a planned meeting between Samaras and Troika official has been cancelled until next week. This is leading to speculation that Greece is falling behind, again, on the targets demanded by its international lenders. Venizelos has also put his oar in, telling the Troika today that his party will not support any extra fiscal measures being pushed onto Greece. Kathimerini has the details: In a meeting with troika officials in Athens Thursday, Evangelos Venizelos said if the targets of the Greek program are not met, then growth-inducing measures should be introduced instead. The socialist leader also presented a \u20ac1bn plan to deal with rampant unemployment in the debt-wracked country. The programme could be financed with European Union structural funds, Venizelos said. Meanwhile, Greek students continue to demonstrate against plans to restructure the Greek higher education sector, merging or abolishing hundreds of departments in an effort to cut costs. Well, that was a lively session with Draghi. Here's a summary of the key points \u2022 The European Central Bank's governing council considered cutting interest rates today, but concluded that the medium-term prospects for the eurozone economy did not merit it (see 1.55pm) \u2022 The ECB has also lowered its economic forecasts, and now predicts the eurozone GDP will be down by -0.1% to -0.9% (see 1.34pm). \u2022 Draghi remains convinced that growth will return before the end of during this year. \u2022 Work is still continuing on the legal framework behind the ECB's programme to offer support to a eurozone country, the Outright Monetary Transactions (OMT) plan (see 2.34pm). Draghi also explained that the plan would only be offered to a country who could still access the financial markets. \u2022 The ECB is not worried by the situation in Italy (officially anyway). Draghi pointed out that markets have recovered from their initial alarm, and argued that the country should not leave its current path of structural reforms (see 2.47pm). \u2022 Draghi rubbished reports this week (see here) that the ECB might quit the troika, claiming that it was just the latest \"angst\" to strike Europe (see 2.04pm). \u2022 He also fired a shot at Cyprus, saying it should allow the international community to check whether anti money-laundering legislation was being correctly applied (see 2.23pm). Draghi appeared in good spirits generally, repeating favourite lines about the need for governments to make structural reforms now, and pointing to the awful youth unemployment statistics. A steady as she goes performance? And that's the end of the press conference. The euro has gained almost one and a half cents against the US dollar, to $1.313. Against the pound, the euro is up 0.7p at 87.04p - so one pound is worth \u20ac1.148. Draghi is also asked is he worried that Italy, his native land, will leave the path of austerity. Or even the single currency? The ECB president won't speculate over the election results, but is adamant that the country must stick to the path of structural reforms. Channel 4's Faisal Islam suggests Draghi was looking at Spain when he spoke about youth unemployment a few minutes ago: A question about negative interest rates - did the European Central Bank consider cutting its deposit rate (levied on the deposits held by commercial banks at the ECB) below its current rate of 0.0% Draghi replies: We've looked at the idea of a negative deposit rate, but unintended consequences could be serious. We'd be in uncharted waters. Is the ECB worried that the euro is too high? Draghi won't be lured into firing a salvo in the currency wars - pointing out that the G8 released a statement last month in which they pledged not to talk down their currencies. I won't be the first person to break it, he says. Michael Steen of the Financial Times just stepped into the lion's den. He explains to Draghi that, contrary to what the ECB president has said during the press conference, we do not all understand how the Outright Monetary Transactions programme would work in practice. All we've seen, says Steen, is a 440-word statement released last summer. It's not clear whether a country needs to still have access to the borrowing markets, for example, to sign up to OMT (at which point the ECB would start buying their bonds). Draghi replies that countries \"should be on the market by themselves\", but even admits that the ECB is \"still working\" on the legal documentation. Tweet of the day: Asked about Cyprus's bailout (still not agreed), Draghi warns that while Cyprus is small, the systemic risk is poses is not. He adds that it is important that Cyprus accepts \"international oversight\" over how effectively its anti money-laundering legislation has been implemented in practice. A question about the slow march towards a single eurozone banking supervisor (at the ECB). Is Draghi worried that the pace is too slow? Apparently not. Progress in building the single supervisory mechanism (SSM) is continuing, says Draghi, adding that: People underestimate amount of political capital that European leaders have invested in the euro. Draghi is asked about the recent nationalisation of Dutch bank SNS Reaal after it was unable to find private investors. Isn't that a reason for angst? Draghi says No: Next question - is the ECB worried that recent optimism over the crisis has pushed stock markets too high, which could lead to a crash? Draghi replies that it is \"very hard to say\" whether stock prices are correct, but suggests that the rally is driven by hopes that the situation in the world economy is improving. Mario Draghi's \"Angst of the Week\" joke (which didn't actually split any sides in Frankfurt) has split opinion: Draghi is asked about reports that the European Central Bank might quit the Troika (the group made up of the ECB, the IMF and the EU). He starts with a joke -- telling the press conference that: Each week we have an angst. citing recent fears over the Long Term Refinancing Operations loans. New angst, every week or two. And usually the fears are misplaced. My suggestion to you is that, once you get gossip from friendly fire.... come and check with us before you write something that doesn't exist. Draghi goes on to point out that the ECB, like the IMF, predeced the Troika - which was created to tackle the 'emergency' in Europe. We believe the ECB has some added value, and competence, in its sector, which it can provide to the Troika, Draghi says. And he ends by insisting that the ECB remains free of political interference. Draghi continues to explain that the ECB sees weak consumption, weak demand, and high unemployment, but in the medium term \"we see the start of a recovery.\" Thus, no rate cut today. INTERESTING: Draghi tells the room that the ECB governing council considered cutting rates. Asked about the weakness in the eurozone economy, the ECB president explains that the possibility of a rate cut was discussed. but the \"prevailing consensus\" was to leave borrowing costs unchanged. On his OMT bond-buying programme: Draghi also says that it is there if a eurozone country decides it needs more help. The rules are what they are... the ball is in the governments' hands Mario Draghi's opening statement is now online here: Introductory statement to the press conference QUESTION TIME: and the first inquiry is based on the Italian election. Draghi responds that markets have calmed down after their initial wobble, and have recognised that elections are a regular feature of the European landscape (he suggests that around 34 elections take place over a four-year cycle). Markets understand that we live in a democracy.... adding that democracy and elections are very precious to everyone. Draghi also suggests that much of the fiscal adjustment in Italy will continue, regardless of the election. And he cracks a rather good joke - that the markets were less impacted by the Italian results than the journalists in the room (and beyond!) Draghi ends by repeating his line that European leaders must take decisive action to mend the imbalances in the region - and cites youth unemployment as a top priority. Draghi says inflation risks are broadly balanced, with the risk of higher inflation (perhaps from oil prices) balanced by the downside risk of weaker economic growth. Here are the ECB's new inflation forecasts, 2013: between 1.2% and 2% (from 1.1% to 2.1%) 2014: between 0.6% to 2.0% (from 0.6% to 2.2%) The ECB has also cut its growth forecast for 2014, to between 0.0% to 2.0% (down from +0.2% to +2.2% back in December). The ECB has revised down its economic forecasts, Draghi confirms. It now expects eurozone GDP in 2013 to shrink, by between -0.1% and -0.9% (from a previous range of +0.3% to -0.9%). So no hope that the region will avoid contracting through during the year. Draghi repeats his line that it is \"essential\" for governments to implement structural reforms. He also points to evidence that banks have repaid around \u20ac200bn to the ECB, by repaying their LTRO loans (made just over a year ago when the ECB pumped more liquidity into the euro economy) Our monetary policy stance remains firmly accommodative, Draghi states. So no plans to tighten yet. Mario Draghi starts by confirming that the ECB voted to leave interest rates unchanged at 0.75%. He cited the latest inflation data, and evidence that inflation expectations remain firmly anchored. However, there is also evidence that the 'economic weakness' (ie the recesssion) has extended into early 2013 Adjustments in the public and private sector will continue to weigh on the economy, he adds -- but Draghi still sees a recovery later this year. And we're off. You can watch the European Central Bank press conference streamed live on its website, just click here. Among other issues, Mario Draghi should release the ECB's latest economic forecasts.... Incidentally, Portugal has warmly welcomed S&amp;P's decision to raise its rating outlook from negative to stable (see 11.40am), calling it \"excellent\". It's a change to see rating agencies getting some love.... And across the City traders, economists, and pundits race to grab some lunch before Mario Draghi's press conference at 1.30pm GMT, or 2.30pm local time. As well as leaving the main refinancing rate unchanged at 0.75%, the ECB will continue to charge commercial banks a 'marginal lending rate' of 1.5%, and also pay zero interest on its deposit facility*. * - money left with the ECB by commercial banks. The euro has risen a smidgen - to $1.3036, on the back of that news (reflecting the small chance of a rate cut). The European Central Bank has voted to leave its benchmark interest rate unchanged, at 0.75%. No other shocks either. The euro has been rising today - can the ECB rate decision (due in one minute) change it?... UK prime minister David Cameron is giving a major speech on the British economy now. My colleague Andrew Sparrow has been live-blogging it here: Politics live blog. He's been defending his economic strategy, and criticising calls for him to relax his deficit reduction targets: Andrew reports: Cameron says there is no choice between tackling debts and promoting growth. As the independent Office for Budget Responsibility has made clear\u2026 \u2026growth has been depressed by the financial crisis\u2026 \u2026the problems in the Eurozone\u2026 \u2026and a 60% rise in oil prices between August 2010 and April 2011. They are absolutely clear that the deficit reduction plan is not responsible. In fact, quite the opposite. Tackling the deficit is the first essential step for growth. And if we don\u2019t do it, we\u2019ll end up facing even greater austerity. Moody\u2019s rating agency says \u201cthe UK's creditworthiness remains extremely high\u201d\u2026 \u2026thanks in part to a \u201cstrong track record\u201d of dealing with our debts and our \u201cpolitical will\u201d. But they also make it absolutely clear that they could downgrade the UK\u2019s credit rating further in the event of \u201creduced political commitment to fiscal consolidation More here. Here's some early reaction to the Bank of England's decision to leave interest rates at 0.5%, and the quantitative easing programme at \u00a3375bn. Stephen Gifford, CBI Director of Economics. reckons the vote on QE was very close: A combination of mixed economic data and the MPC\u2019s recent tilt in a more dovish direction, is likely to have made this decision a close call. With only a modest pick-up in growth expected, the possibility of further QE will remain a live issue. Capital Economics suspects we'll see more QE soon: We expect that it will not take much to swing a majority of members in support of more stimulus in the near future Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight believes the Bank is feeling the pressure to do more to help the UK economy. We expect the Bank of England to deliver one \u00a325bn portion of QE in the second quarter (taking the stock up to \u00a3400 billion) with another \u00a325bn portion (taking the stock up to \u00a3425 billion) occurring shortly after Mark Carney takes over as Bank of England Governor in July. It is also evident that the Bank of England is looking for other ways of helping the economy, particularly in trying to get more working capital through to smaller companies. Further measures seem highly likely in this area. Jeremy Cook, chief economist at foreign exchange company, World First, reckons the Bank might now wait for Mr Carney. \u201cData coming out of the UK has not got materially worse since the most recent decision, but the relative weakness of the Funding for Lending Scheme had prompted many to forecast that the BOE would \u2018pull the lever\u2019. However, I think the Bank will now hold on policy until Mark Carney takes the reins of the MPC in July\u2026\u201d Just to clarify the situation with quantitative easing. \u2022 The Bank of England has already created \u00a3375bn of \"new\" electronic money, in a programme dating back four years. \u2022 This money (known as the asset purchase scheme) has been used to buy British government bonds from UK banks. \u2022 The funds, the Bank of England says, should then flow into the wider economy through increased lending, stimulating economic growth. Critics question whether that actually happens in practice \u2013 but it has certainly helped push down UK borrowing costs. \u2022 The MPC could have decided to increase the programme again, most likely in a \u00a325bn slug of new money. The minutes of today's meeting will be released on Wednesday 20 March, which by delicious timing is also Budget Day. That's when get the details of the voting, and find out how many doves pushed for more QE. The pound has jumped by half a cent, to $1.505, while UK gilts are falling in value. That's pushed the yield on 10-year gilts up to 1.98%, from 1.95% this morning. There's no further statement from the Bank of England - but you can see the decision itself here: Bank of England maintains Bank Rate at 0.5% and the size of the Asset Purchase Programme at \u00a3375 billion BREAKING: The Bank of England has voted to leave its quantitative easing budget unchanged at \u00a3375bn. Interest rates remain at their record low of 0.5% More to follow! Standard &amp; Poor's has just revised UP its outlook on Portugal, from negative to stable. It issued the vote of confidence after concluding that Portugal is likely to persuade its lenders to give it more time to pay its bailout loans. Here's S&amp;P's logic: \u2022 We expect Portugal's official European lenders to lengthen the maturity profiles of their loans to Portugal. In our view, this should reduce Portugal's public sector refinancing risks. \u2022 We also expect the \"Troika\" to adjust Portugal's fiscal consolidation path to allow for weaker-than-previously-assumed economic performance. In our opinion, this makes Portugal's adjustment process more sustainable, both economically and socially, and reduces the risk that it will not comply with the program. \u2022 We are therefore revising our outlook on the rating on Portugal to stable from negative. This leaves Portugal with a junk rating of BB, though (two notches below investment grade). Greece's unemployment rate has actually fallen, for the first time since its economic downturn began five years ago. In what could be a much-needed encouraging sign, the country's jobless rate dropped to 26.4% in December, from 26.6% in November. It appears that Greek companies may have been encouraged to take on more workers as the long saga of Greece \u20ac34bn aid tranche was finally resolved at the end of 2012. It's only a glimmer of hope, at best \u2013 Greece still has the highest jobless rate in the eurozone (ahead of Spain's 26.2%), and it's economy is still shrinking. Speaking of Silvio Berlusconi \u2026 he's just been sentenced to a year's imprisonment following a trial for leaking the contents of a wiretapped phone call to his brother's newspaper. Berlusconi had denied pushing Il Giornale to publish the transcript of the call to damage a political opponent, but the court has just issued its ruling. However, the handcuffs are not coming out. Berlusconi can't actually be jailed until the appeal's process has been concluded \u2013 so this doesn't appear to have a major impact on the political situation in Italy. Albert Edwards, the notoriously bearish City analyst, isn't impressed to see the Dow Jones industrial average at record levels - and reckons it means trouble ahead: In a new note sent to his Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale clients, Edwards said: As the Dow surges to all time highs it feels eerily similar to the prior mid-2007 peak. Exactly the same jitters abound of a bond bear market and true to form Ben Bernanke is making the same complacent comments. (mind you, Edwards was predicting a 70% stock market tumble in July 2011, and that forecast remains unfilled) Edwards also touches on the Italian election: I believe the electorate were right to reject further austerity. There will be more such electoral revulsion on the way, but for Italy it doesn't really matter anyway. They can remove the horse-hair shirt forced on them by the ECB/Germany/European Commission and these dreary architects of depression can be told to take a very large running jump. Buy Italy! We've explained before that the motives behind Beppe Grillo's rase were more complex than a simple austerity backlash, but it's true that Silvio Berlusconi's popularity was swelled by his airy promises to cut taxes. Edwards also produces a graph of on and off-balance sheet liabilities to illustrate that Italy's debt problems as less alarming then other countries. Such as the UK: Reassuring news for Spain - it successfully sold \u20ac5bn of bonds at auction this morning, its maximum target. It also paid lower borrowing costs, with investors accepting yields of 4.917% on Spanish 10-year debt, down from 5.2% in February. It suggests calm is returning to the bond markets after the excitement caused by the Italian election. France's finance minister has warned of a social crisis and a surge in popularity for extremist political groups unless Europe ends its focus on austerity and fiscal cuts. Speaking in Brussels this morning, Pierre Moscovici said continuing on the current course would ultimately \"nourish a social crisis that leads to populism\". His solution \u2013 \"more Europe\" \u2013 with closer ties between its members to help each other back to growth. He argued that the \"existential\" eurozone crisis is over (ie, the risk of the euro breaking up), but a crisis remains with the single currency region. Moscovici conceded that countries couldn't simply ignore their debt levels, saying that national debts were \"a challenge for any country\" regardless of their situation. But he argued that measures such as eurobonds, and a new fund to tackle Europe's jobless crisis, would be a much better approach. France isn't expected to hit the EU's target of a deficit no bigger than 3% of GDP this year. But with French unemployment over 10%, the view in Paris is that growth is more important then debt levels. Moscovici was speaking at a conference called Failed austerity in Europe \u2013 the way out (so I don't expect he was heckled!). My former colleague David Gow is attending the event, and tweeted the main highlights: The pound is weakening this morning, dropping below the $1.50 mark (seen a test of the nation's economic virility) again. Traders say sterling is being pushed down by speculation that the Bank of England will announce more QE, as well as the FT's report that its mandate will be widened (see 9.35am) The Bank of England could be about receive sweeping new powers to help drive the UK out of its economic stagnation. The Financial Times has splashed on the news that the new Bank of England governor will be given a new brief, to help stimulate growth in the UK. It claims that George Osborne will announce a new era of looser monetary policy in the budget in two weeks time, by changing the Bank's mandate. This could mean a new inflation target (currently 2%), or asking the Bank to also target unemployment (as the US Federal Reserve now does). Another option is to get the Bank to target nominal GDP (the cash value of the economy). Carney himself hinted last December that it could make more sense to get central banks to push for economic growth rather than just encouraging a low-inflation environment (in which growth would bloom). The story goes on to say that Treasury officials are \"discussing proposals\" \u2013 so it's not clear that Osborne has made his mind up (and, to be fair, the \"dual mandate\" issue has been kicked around in economics circles for some time). Something for the MPC to get their teeth into this morning as they discuss the state of the UK economy. With the eurozone recession continuing, some members of the European Central Bank may be pushing for a rate cut in Frankfurt today. Most economists expect them to be outvoted, though. Just four out of 76 economists polled by Reuters reckons we'll see a cut today, with 22 expecting borrowing costs to be cut from their current level of 0.75% at some stage. Eurozone inflation has fallen to 1.8%, which is bang in line with the ECB's target of just below the 2% mark. City economists are split over whether the Bank of England will take the plunge and increase its QE budget by another \u00a325bn, to \u00a3400bn. A Reuters roll last week found that 40% of economists expected an increase, but since then there's been growing speculation of action. So it's too close to call. Michael Saunders of Citigroup is in the 'more QE' camp: A majority of the MPC have reached the point where they agree that the economy needs more stimulus...Now they have to agree on how to do it. The MPC does appear to be divided over the way forward, though. Last month deputy governor Paul Tucker caused a storm by discussing imposing 'negative interest rates' on commercial banks to force them to lend - an idea swiftly shot down by colleague Charlie Bean. This gives the impression of two camps in the Bank - one who thinks the existing levers of monetary policy are sufficient, and one which believes more radical action is needed. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the latest developments in the eurozone financial crisis and across the global economy. It's a big day for central banking, with the Bank of England and the European Central Bank holding their monthly meetings to debate monetary policy and set interest rates. Both meetings promise to be really rather interesting. In the Bank of England's case, there's a real chance that the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) will vote to pump another dose of electronic money into the system through its quantitative easing programme. Last month the MPC was split 6-3 over QE - so can the three doves (which including governor Sir Mervyn King) persuade at least two more colleagues over to their perch? The ECB isn't expected to cut its interest rates (but, as with the BoE, you never know). The excitement could come Mario Draghi holds his press conference this afternoon. Expect a grilling on the situation in Italy -- where the political deadlock has raised questions over the effectiveness of Draghi's pledge to buy unlimited government bonds if a country seeks help. How, reporters in Frankfurt will doubtless ask, could the ECB take the risk of loading itself up with, par exemple, Italian debt when a maverick like Beppe Grillo is calling the shots? Not to mention Silvio Berlusconi.... That Outright Monetary Transactions (OMT) programme isn't full-blown QE, but it's the best weapon in the ECB's locker to control, tame and fix the crisis. Draghi's comments will also be scrutinised for signs that the ECB might cut interest rates in the coming months -- which would bring some relief to struggling firms and households across the eurozone. Timings: Bank of England rate/QE decision: noon GMT European Central Bank rate decision: 12.45pm GMT European Central Bank press conference: 1.30pm GMT ....... We'll also be tracking other events across the eurozone and the wider economy. That will include the situation in Greece, where Troika officials continue their latest visit to Athens to check the country's progress against its bailout targets.",

    "webTitle": "Aviva's supposed restructuring still isn't paying dividends", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "\"One Aviva\", says the cheerful corporate slogan. Two dividend cuts in four years is the reality for suffering shareholders, who must now face the fact that their troubles did not end when Andrew Moss was ejected from the chief executive's office last spring. The thought then was that plain-speaking chairman John McFarlane could perform some emergency surgery on Aviva and save the dividend. His operations, culminating in a sale of the US business, seemed to go well. Yes, the scar was horrible in the shape of \u00a33.3bn of impairments and writedowns, but at least Aviva could boast a substantially healthier capital surplus. New boss Mark Wilson, however, has arrived to point out that Aviva's woes run a lot deeper. Financial gearing is too high and the sums of cash being generated are too low to justify a \u00a3700m dividend bill. In the past, the problem has been dodged thanks to those shareholders who (foolishly) took their dividend in shares. Enough of that nonsense, Wilson has said, in effect: we'll cut the dividend by 44% so that it can be covered by cash and we'll cancel the scrip option. The clearing of the decks is justified. As Wilson says, the insurance sector has made an industry out of complexity and it's probably best to start from a position where investors have a dividend they can believe in. All the same, the cut is a crushing blow to the idea that Aviva's problems required only one step backwards; no wonder the shares went 12% lower on Thursday. What has been exposed \u2013 yet again \u2013 is that the company was disgracefully undermanaged by overpaid and complacent directors in the decade since it adopted its Aviva monicker. The company was born a couple of years earlier, in effect, from a three-way combination of Norwich Union, Commercial Union and General Accident. A Commercial Accident waiting to happen, said the sceptics, and they have been proved correct. The priority should have been a much harder attack on costs and a rigorous debate on where Aviva should concentrate its resources and capital. Instead, as McFarlane pointed out when he became chairman, Aviva was still perceived as bureaucratic and inefficient even after taking \u00a31.3bn in restructuring charges over five years; he and Wilson think at least \u00a3400m of annual savings can now be achieved. And the US adventure, starting with the \u00a31.6bn acquisition in 2006 of AmerUS, was a blunder born of a misguided ambition to be everywhere. Good luck to Wilson, who can hardly fail to do better than his predecessors. In the meantime, survey the extraordinary scale of 10 years of failure. First, the dividend will be now be set at the lowest level during the Aviva era. Second, remember that Aviva and Prudential's shares were roughly neck-and-neck at 750p-800p when the former made its vainglorious and doomed offer for the latter in 2006; Aviva's share price now is 319p while Prudential passed \u00a310 this week. Third \u2013 and most remarkable \u2013 consider that Aviva's market capitalisation (\u00a39.25bn) has almost converged with that of Standard Life (\u00a38.8bn), a company that a decade ago was in the midst of deep crisis after being over-exposed to equities (and zealous regulators) during 2003's stock market plunge. On Thursday, Standard Life increased its ordinary dividend by 6.5% and handed out a \u00a3300m special dividend. The difference? Standard Life cut costs earlier, has a simpler business model and decided to stick to what it does best, like fund management. In other words, unlike Aviva, it had a strategy.",

      "body": "<p>\"One Aviva\", says the cheerful corporate slogan. Two dividend cuts in four years is the reality for suffering shareholders, who must now face the fact that their troubles did not end when Andrew Moss was ejected from the chief executive's office last spring.</p> <p>The thought then was that plain-speaking chairman John McFarlane could perform some emergency surgery on Aviva and save the dividend. His operations, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/nov/08/aviva-us-division-selloff\" title=\"\">culminating in a sale of the US business</a>, seemed to go well. Yes, the scar was horrible in the shape of \u00a33.3bn of impairments and writedowns, but at least Aviva could boast a substantially healthier capital surplus.</p> <p>New boss Mark Wilson, however, has arrived to point out that Aviva's woes run a lot deeper. Financial gearing is too high and the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2013/mar/07/aviva-no-bonuses-executive-pay-freeze\" title=\"\">sums of cash being generated are too low to justify a \u00a3700m dividend bill</a>. In the past, the problem has been dodged thanks to those shareholders who (foolishly) took their dividend in shares. Enough of that nonsense, Wilson has said, in effect: we'll cut the dividend by 44% so that it can be covered by cash and we'll cancel the scrip option.</p> <p>The clearing of the decks is justified. As Wilson says, the insurance sector has made an industry out of complexity and it's probably best to start from a position where investors have a dividend they can believe in. All the same, the cut is a crushing blow to the idea that Aviva's problems required only one step backwards; no wonder the shares went 12% lower on Thursday.</p> <p>What has been exposed \u2013 yet again \u2013 is that the company was disgracefully undermanaged by overpaid and complacent directors in the decade since it adopted its Aviva monicker. The company was born a couple of years earlier, in effect, from a three-way combination of Norwich Union, Commercial Union and General Accident. A Commercial Accident waiting to happen, said the sceptics, and they have been proved correct. The priority should have been a much harder attack on costs and a rigorous debate on where Aviva should concentrate its resources and capital.</p> <p>Instead, as McFarlane pointed out when he became chairman, Aviva was still perceived as bureaucratic and inefficient even after taking \u00a31.3bn in restructuring charges over five years; he and Wilson think at least \u00a3400m of annual savings can now be achieved. And the US adventure, starting with the \u00a31.6bn acquisition in 2006 of AmerUS, was a blunder born of a misguided ambition to be everywhere.</p> <p>Good luck to Wilson, who can hardly fail to do better than his predecessors. In the meantime, survey the extraordinary scale of 10 years of failure. First, the dividend will be now be set at the lowest level during the Aviva era. Second, remember that Aviva and Prudential's shares were roughly neck-and-neck at 750p-800p when the former made its vainglorious and doomed offer for the latter in 2006; Aviva's share price now is 319p while Prudential passed \u00a310 this week.</p> <p>Third \u2013 and most remarkable \u2013 consider that Aviva's market capitalisation (\u00a39.25bn) has almost converged with that of Standard Life (\u00a38.8bn), a company that a decade ago was in the midst of deep crisis after being over-exposed to equities (and zealous regulators) during 2003's stock market plunge.</p> <p>On Thursday, Standard Life increased its ordinary dividend by 6.5% and handed out a \u00a3300m special dividend. The difference? Standard Life cut costs earlier, has a simpler business model and decided to stick to what it does best, like fund management. In other words, unlike Aviva, it had a strategy.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The insurance firm Aviva will pay no executive bonuses this year and is freezing pay for senior management after crashing into the red with a \u00a33.1bn loss after tax. The company also reduced its full-year dividend by 27%, sending the shares down by 15% in early trading on Thursday, and wiping more than \u00a31.5bn off its stock market value. After selling a string of businesses, Aviva said cashflows from the remaining assets could not sustain the dividend. Mark Wilson, who took over as chief executive in December, said: \"It's like walking up an escalator that is going down; today we have stopped the escalator.\" He said the company intended to increase the dividend over time, with reference to cash flow and earnings. He said the pay decision had been made after discussions with Aviva's shareholders. \"We've had continuing and ongoing and appropriate discussions with investors on pay. The reason is simple, it's a tough economic market. Given our results it was not appropriate that we pay bonuses to our executives, or pay rises to the top 400 people in the group.\" The company said it would not claw back bonuses previously awarded. Wilson said: \"When it comes to bonuses, it has to be looked at in terms of legal obligations.\" Aviva made about 2,500 job cuts in 2012 and there may be more to come this year. Wilson said: \"Undoubtedly there may be some. It's not like last year. We have more expense reduction to go. The next round is on things like insolvency costs, IT costs, real estate costs.\" The insurer swung from a \u00a360m pre-tax profit in 2011 to a \u00a33.05bn pre-tax loss, dragged down by a \u00a33.3bn writedown when it sold its US business. An activist group of existing and former policyholders, the Norwich Union Policyholders' Action Group (NUPAG), said on Thursday: \"[The] results suggest that at the end of 2011 some balance sheet values were massively overstated.\" Ignoring one-off items, Aviva's profits for 2012 decreased by 4% to \u00a31.8bn, which Wilson blamed on foreign exchange movements. He said the immediate issues facing the insurer have been addressed. \"We now need to take Aviva to the next stage of its turnaround. The insurance sector has made an industry out of complexity. We need to be simple and as predictable as a Swiss clock. That is my promise.\"",

Mark Wilson, who took over as chief executive in December, said: \"It's like walking up an escalator that is going down; today we have stopped the escalator.\" He said the company intended to increase the dividend over time, with reference to cash flow and earnings.</p> <p>He said the pay decision had been made after discussions with Aviva's shareholders. \"We've had continuing and ongoing and appropriate discussions with investors on pay. The reason is simple, it's a tough economic market. Given our results it was not appropriate that we pay bonuses to our executives, or pay rises to the top 400 people in the group.\"</p> <p>The company said it would not claw back bonuses previously awarded. Wilson said: \"When it comes to bonuses, it has to be looked at in terms of legal obligations.\"</p> <p>Aviva made about 2,500 job cuts in 2012 and there may be more to come this year. Wilson said: \"Undoubtedly there may be some. It's not like last year. We have more expense reduction to go. The next round is on things like insolvency costs, IT costs, real estate costs.\"</p> <p>The insurer swung from a \u00a360m pre-tax profit in 2011 to a \u00a33.05bn pre-tax loss, dragged down by a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/nov/08/aviva-us-division-selloff?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">\u00a33.3bn writedown when it sold its US business.</a></p> <p>An activist group of existing and former policyholders, the Norwich Union Policyholders' Action Group (NUPAG), said on Thursday: \"[The] results suggest that at the end of 2011 some balance sheet values were massively overstated.\"</p> <p>Ignoring one-off items, Aviva's profits for 2012 decreased by 4% to \u00a31.8bn, which Wilson blamed on foreign exchange movements.</p> <p>He said the immediate issues facing the insurer have been addressed. \"We now need to take Aviva to the next stage of its turnaround. The insurance sector has made an industry out of complexity. We need to be simple and as predictable as a Swiss clock. That is my promise.\"</p>",
