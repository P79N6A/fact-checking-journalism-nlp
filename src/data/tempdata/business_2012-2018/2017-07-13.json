If a foreign government, in this case Saudi Arabia\u2019s royal family, doesn\u2019t like the rules in London, the UK is happy to be flexible. For some, the Financial Conduct Authority\u2019s proposed rewrite of the listing rules to woo state-backed companies is a fuss about nothing. Aramco is an enormous beast that will shower fees on bankers and lawyers, and maybe also burnish London\u2019s standing. It could easily float here under a so-called \u201cstandard\u201d listing if it wished. But, if the price of keeping it away from New York is a tweak to the definition of a prestige \u201cpremium\u201d listing, so be it. After all, it will be argued, nobody will be compelled to buy shares in this $1tn, or possibly $2tn, monster. If only 5% of Aramco\u2019s shares are made available to outsiders, the company won\u2019t qualify for inclusion in FTSE indices and tracker funds will have to stay away. The problem with this relaxed view is that the FCA\u2019s proposed change makes London look ridiculous. The definition of a \u201cpremium\u201d listing is well understood and was established by hard experience of how outside investors can be abused by a single controlling shareholder. Two conditions of a \u201cpremium\u201d listing are seen as fundamental protections. First, tight controls must apply when the company and the controlling shareholder are conducting deals with each other. Second, outside shareholders should get a say on the appointment of independent directors. The FCA\u2019s proposal, in essence, is that sovereign-controlled companies can ignore both conditions but still qualify for a premium listing. They\u2019ll have to follow the other premium rules, just not those two. The FCA\u2019s thin justification is that \u201csovereign owners tend to be different from private sector individuals or entities in both their motivations and their nature\u201d. Is that really true, though? Some will be different, some won\u2019t, and it\u2019s hard to know in advance. That is the point of applying rules across the board. The current set-up works perfectly well and is popular. Whatever the FCA says about adapting and updating markets, this exercise seems to be driven by short-term considerations: get Aramco through the door, and worry later about the long-term hit to London\u2019s status as a high-class financial centre. Politicians, obsessed by Brexit, will cheer if the Saudis do indeed choose London. The rest of us should deplore a grubby little arrangement. AstraZeneca \u2013 a Soriot state of affairs Come on, Pascal Soriot, don\u2019t be shy. Are you staying or going as chief executive of AstraZeneca? It is astonishing that Soriot and his employer left this question hanging in the air all day on Thursday. Israeli newspaper Calcalist reported on Wednesday that Soriot is about to quit to join Israeli outfit Teva Pharmaceuticals and seemed confident about the details of his new remuneration package, down to the signing-on fee of $20m. The stock market thought, or feared, there\u2019s something in the tale. AstraZeneca\u2019s share price fell 3.5%, a mighty move for a firm worth \u00a365bn. Soriot\u2019s silence didn\u2019t help. If the tale is rubbish, it would be easy for the company to knock it down without breaching its pedantic policy of never commenting on rumours. At this stage, all that can reasonably be said is that Soriot\u2019s departure would be extraordinary. At AstraZenca, he\u2019s running one of the world\u2019s finest pharmaceutical companies with a multibillion-pound budget to pursue pioneering research and development. Teva is half the size and most of its business is concentrated in copycat generic medicines, which are surely less interesting for a rounded individual such as Soriot who is genuinely in love with science. AstraZeneca has also showered him with riches. Last year his package was worth \u00a313m, which ought to be enough to secure his loyalty. Then there\u2019s the fact that 2017 is supposed to be the pivotal year for AstraZeneca. The results of a critical trial on a potential blockbuster lung cancer treatment are due soon, setting the stage for the company to prove it was right to reject Pfizer\u2019s takeover bid in 2014 and back its long-term standalone prospects. For all those reasons, Soriot is probably staying put. But the shareholders \u2013 and, more importantly, his colleagues \u2013 deserve to be told. This is not a sensitive takeover situation. You are allowed to apply common sense and speak. The odd value in RBS Good news: the National Audit Office says the Treasury\u2019s sale of \u00a32.1bn worth of shares in Royal Bank of Scotland in 2015 was \u201cwell planned and organised and represented value for money\u201d. The last virtue is almost unarguable, since the Treasury bagged 330p a share versus RBS\u2019 current share price of 257p. With the benefit of hindsight, one wishes the chancellor had flogged a few more. There\u2019s one oddity in the report, however. It is how UKFI and its advisers, Goldman Sachs and Rothschild, established the \u201cfair value\u201d range for RBS shares. The process would not have been straightforward, since the bank faced so many litigation, conduct and regulatory issues. A view had to be taken on all, and a conservative bias then applied. Even against that confusing backdrop, however, the valuation range was remarkably wide \u2013 between 177p and 488p per share. That\u2019s not useful advice. It sounds more like well-paid advisers covering their backs.",

The scheme would reward users of lighter, cleaner vehicles and ensure a steady stream of revenue to the exchequer (pdf), with the \u00a327bn received annually from fuel duty now jeopardised by electric vehicles. Gergely Raccuja, 27, said that allocating 20% of funds directly for road repair would raise enough money to eradicate the UK\u2019s potholes in five years, persuading the judges of the 2017 Wolfson Economics Prize, which asked for proposals for funding better, safer roads in a fair way while benefitting the economy and the environment. Raccuja\u2019s proposal argued that abolishing fuel duty and vehicle excise duty in favour of a simple distance-based charge, with heavier and more polluting vehicles paying more, would be fairer and restore trust between government and motorists. It would also ensure revenues in an era of electric and autonomous vehicles. The charge would be collected by insurers, based on mileage and model, potentially monthly using telematics or as an annual charge. The founder of the prize, Next fashion chain boss Lord Simon Wolfson, said it was a \u201cgroundbreaking, yet simple\u201d solution. Raccuja beat competition including a proposal for tradeable road miles from the economist Deirdre King and her husband Edmund, head of the AA motoring organisation. Other shortlisted entries suggested rewarding people for changing their driving habits to beat congestion, and using different technologies to impose variable charges for journeys. Raccuja said: \u201cThe key to our entry was to keep things simple, yet come up with an answer that was sophisticated enough to deal with an upheaval in cars and road transport which hasn\u2019t been seen since the introduction of the motor car well over a century ago. I hope I can persuade our politicians too that everything to do with our roads could be better.\u201d Steve Gooding, the director of the RAC Foundation, which provided input to Raccuja\u2019s final submission, said the clock was ticking for policymakers as existing models of tax and spending on roads faced becoming redundant: \u201cThe common themes of several entries have been both the pressing need for change and the belief there is a better option to balance what drivers contribute to the finances of the country and what they get in return.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "City regulator plans rule change to allow Saudi oil giant's $2tn float in London", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The City regulator is proposing to water down stock market rules in a move regarded as an attempt to attract the world\u2019s biggest ever flotation \u2013 of Saudi Aramco, the Gulf kingdom\u2019s state oil company \u2013 to London. The proposals by the Financial Conduct Authority come as Aramco weighs up which financial centre to pick for the sale of 5% of its shares. The company could be valued at $2tn \u2013 a huge price tag that would also generate hundreds of millions of dollars in fees for investment bankers, lawyers and other professional firms involved in stock market flotations. However, investors immediately warned that the FCA\u2019s proposal to create a new category for firms controlled by a shareholder that is a sovereign country could damage London\u2019s reputation for protecting shareholders in companies that have dominant owners. While its consultation document did not name any companies, the FCA\u2019s proposal was widely regarded as being framed to address some of problems that Saudi Aramco faces in seeking a listing on the London Stock Exchange. The UK is keen to lure the Saudi company. The prime minister, Theresa May, and Xavier Rolet, the head of the LSE, visited Riyadh in April to meet Aramco\u2019s chief executive Khalid al-Falih, who is also the kingdom\u2019s energy minister. The FCA\u2019s proposals would allow state-owned companies to qualify for a premium listing \u2013 which has more onerous corporate governance rules \u2013 without having to meet two criteria. One relates to how the company and the controlling shareholder conduct deals with each other, and the second allows investors a vote on independent directors. Chris Cummings, the chief executive of the Investment Association, which represents the City\u2019s biggest fund managers, said: \u201cInvestors believe a premium listed segment without these investor protections is not a premium segment and will not provide the protections that investors expect.\u201d But Andrew Bailey, the chief executive of the FCA, justified the changes on the basis that sovereign owners behave differently to other sorts of companies. \u201cSovereign owners are different from private sector individuals or companies \u2013 both in their motivations and in their nature. Investors have long recognised this and capital markets are well adapted to assess the treatment of other investors by sovereign countries,\u201d Bailey said. This explanation did not convince everyone. Nicholas Holmes, the equity capital markets partner at law firm Ashurst, said that while sovereign owners may have different motivations, this is did not reduce the need for proper scrutiny. \u201cThe risk is a dilution of the premium listing brand,\u201d said Holmes. Ashley Hamilton Claxton, the corporate governance manager at Royal London Asset Management, said: \u201cIf the proposals in this consultation document are implemented, it will be bad news for London and will reverse the progress we have made in recent years to uphold strong governance and protect minority shareholders,\u201d she added. The proposals are being made at a time when London is keen to promote its status as a leading financial centre in the wake of the Brexit vote. Miles Celic, the chief executive of lobby group TheCityUK, said: \u201cIt is positive that our regulator takes an open-minded approach to regulatory change. This will become ever more critical as we come closer to Brexit and beyond.\u201d A spokesperson for LSE also welcomed the changes: \u201cWe support initiatives that enable UK markets to function well and in an orderly and internationally competitive manner, with a high level of investor protection, meeting the demands of both issuers and global investors for a range of options to realise their capital raising and investment needs\u201d. Despite its size, Saudi Aramco would not quality for an entry in the FTSE 100 stock market index, which would require major City investors to buy the shares to enable them to run their tracker funds. Chris Woods, a managing director at FTSE Russell, said: \u201cThe index ground rules include the requirement to have a premium listing in London, an assigned nationality of UK, and minimum free floats of 25% for UK incorporated companies and 50% for non-UK incorporated companies. All these requirements will remain unchanged.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>The City regulator is proposing to water down stock market rules in a move regarded as an attempt to attract the world\u2019s biggest ever flotation \u2013 of Saudi Aramco, the Gulf kingdom\u2019s state oil company \u2013 to London.</p> <p>The proposals by the Financial Conduct Authority come as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/16/saudi-aramco-10-trillion-dollar-mystery-heart-of-gulf-state\"> Aramco </a>weighs up which financial centre to pick for the sale of 5% of its shares. The company could be valued at $2tn \u2013 a huge price tag that would also generate hundreds of millions of dollars in fees for investment bankers, lawyers and other professional firms involved in stock market flotations.</p> <p>However, investors immediately warned that the FCA\u2019s proposal to create a new category for firms controlled by a shareholder that is a sovereign country could damage London\u2019s reputation for protecting shareholders in companies that have dominant owners.</p> <p>While<a href=\"https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/consultation/cp17-21.pdf\"> its consultation document</a> did not name any companies, the FCA\u2019s proposal was widely regarded as being framed to address some of problems that Saudi Aramco faces in seeking a listing on the London Stock Exchange.<br></p> <p>The UK is keen to lure the Saudi company. The prime minister, Theresa May, and Xavier Rolet, the head of the LSE, v<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/apr/05/theresa-may-lse-saudi-aramco-uk-london-stock-exchange-oil\">isited Riyadh in April </a>to meet Aramco\u2019s chief executive Khalid al-Falih, who is also the kingdom\u2019s energy minister.<br></p> <p>The FCA\u2019s proposals would allow state-owned companies to qualify for a premium listing \u2013 which has more onerous corporate governance rules \u2013 without having to meet two criteria. One relates to how the company and the controlling shareholder conduct deals with each other, and the second allows investors a vote on independent directors.</p> <p>Chris Cummings, the chief executive of the Investment Association, which represents the City\u2019s biggest fund managers, said: \u201cInvestors believe a premium listed segment without these investor protections is not a premium segment and will not provide the protections that investors expect.\u201d</p> <p>But Andrew Bailey, the chief executive of the FCA, justified the changes on the basis that sovereign owners behave differently to other sorts of companies. \u201cSovereign owners are different from private sector individuals or companies \u2013 both in their motivations and in their nature. Investors have long recognised this and capital markets are well adapted to assess the treatment of other investors by sovereign countries,\u201d Bailey said.</p> <p>This explanation did not convince everyone. Nicholas Holmes, the equity capital markets partner at law firm Ashurst<strong>, </strong>said that while sovereign owners may have different motivations, this is did not reduce the need for proper scrutiny. \u201cThe risk is a dilution of the premium listing brand,\u201d said Holmes.</p> <p>Ashley Hamilton Claxton, the corporate governance manager at Royal London Asset Management, said: \u201cIf the proposals in this consultation document are implemented, it will be bad news for London and will reverse the progress we have made in recent years to uphold strong governance and protect minority shareholders,\u201d she added.</p> <p>The proposals are being made at a time when London is keen to promote its status as a leading financial centre in the wake of the Brexit vote. </p> <p>Miles Celic, the chief executive of lobby group TheCityUK, said: \u201cIt is positive that our regulator takes an open-minded approach to regulatory change. This will become ever more critical as we come closer to Brexit and beyond.\u201d<br></p> <p>A spokesperson for LSE also welcomed the changes: \u201cWe support initiatives that enable UK markets to function well and in an orderly and internationally competitive manner, with a high level of investor protection, meeting the demands of both issuers and global investors for a range of options to realise their capital raising and investment needs\u201d.</p> <p>Despite its size, Saudi Aramco would not quality for an entry in the FTSE 100 stock market index, which would require major City investors to buy the shares to enable them to run their tracker funds.</p> <p>Chris Woods, a managing director at FTSE Russell, said: \u201cThe index ground rules include the requirement to have a premium listing in London, an assigned nationality of UK, and minimum free floats of 25% for UK incorporated companies and 50% for non-UK incorporated companies. All these requirements will remain unchanged.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Philip Morris, the multinational company best known for Marlboro cigarettes, has developed a corporate strategy to undermine a global treaty and fight tobacco regulation around the world, leaked documents reveal. A slide presentation from 2014 entitled \u201cCorporate Affairs Approaches and Issues\u201d details a plan to counter plain packaging \u2013 the standardised packs and labelling that have recently been introduced in the UK. A World Health Organisation treaty urges their adoption. Tobacco companies have fought them through the courts in a number of countries, as a major Guardian investigation this week revealed. The document lists the \u201ccomponents of a preventive packaging plan\u201d including challenging the introduction of plain packs as unconstitutional and in breach of trade agreements and copyrights. The Guardian investigation revealed letters and court papers to eight governments in Africa from multinational tobacco companies that used some or all of those arguments to oppose regulations, including plain packaging. The Philip Morris International (PMI) presentation suggests \u201cpotential process-based roadblocks\u201d to hold up plain packaging and urges staff to \u201ctake command over media reporting\u201d. The document, part of a cache passed to Reuters, makes it clear that a PMI priority is to keep the issue of tobacco taxes out of the hands of the ministry of health and within the remit of the minister of finance in countries where it is doing business. \u201cEnsure that tobacco taxation policy remains driven by MoFs,\u201d it says. The fear of the tobacco industry is that health ministers will be persuaded by public health campaigners and agencies such as the WHO to hike tobacco taxes \u2013 a move that has been proven to reduce smoking. Finance ministers, however, can potentially be persuaded that there is a risk of losing revenue. The document shows PMI is also alarmed by the possibility of countries getting together to agree a higher tax, which prevents smuggling \u2013 the main argument the industry uses against tax hikes by single governments. The strategy is to \u201cprevent regional tax initiatives (tax harmonization, earmarking)\u201d. PMI\u2019s corporate affairs staff must \u201cplay the political game\u201d, moving tobacco issues away from the ministry of health and finding allies that cannot be ignored. \u201cAllow for political cover and political wins,\u201d it says, and \u201croadblocks are as important as solutions\u201d. The documents reveal the tobacco giant\u2019s opposition to the WHO\u2019s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC), which underpins the anti-smoking interventions such as plain packs and raising taxes that governments globally are trying to introduce. At meetings of ministers and officials from governments that have signed the treaty, PMI has done its best to lobby, even though the tobacco companies and their advocates are excluded from the conferences. During the 2014 FCTC meeting in Moscow, the documents show, PMI set up a \u201ccoordinating room\u201d outside the conference. At the end of the meeting, on 18 October 2014, Chris Koddermann, the executive in charge, sent an email congratulating his 33-strong team on their success in diluting or blocking measures intended to strengthen tobacco controls and reduce cigarette sales. Overall, the company achieved its \u201ctrade-related campaign objectives\u201d, including \u201cavoiding a declaration of health over trade\u201d and \u201cavoiding the recognition of the FCTC as an international standard\u201d, wrote Koddermann. The achievements were the culmination of a two-year effort, his email said. Philip Morris International says there is nothing improper about its executives engaging with government officials. \u201cAs a company in a highly regulated industry, speaking with governments is part of our everyday business,\u201d said Tony Snyder, PMI\u2019s vice-president of communications. \u201cThe fact that Reuters has seen internal emails discussing our engagement with governments does not make those interactions inappropriate.\u201d Deborah Arnott, the chief executive of action on Smoking and Health, said: \u201cYet again the appalling hypocrisy and dishonesty of the tobacco industry has been revealed for all to see. On the one hand, Philip Morris executives talk about the end of smoking, and a new world of reduced-harm nicotine products. On the other hand, they\u2019re making enormous efforts to subvert and undermine the key world treaty on tobacco control. \u201cPMI\u2019s actions make clear that it plans to continue to sell its lethal products to as many people as possible, particularly in developing countries. Nothing this company says about its positive intentions can be taken at face value.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "UK public finances face twin threat from Brexit and downturn, says OBR", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s public finances are in worse shape to withstand a recession than they were on the eve of the 2007 financial crash a decade ago and face the twin threat of a fresh downturn and Brexit, the Treasury\u2019s independent forecaster has warned. The Office for Budget Responsibility \u2013 the UK\u2019s fiscal watchdog \u2013 said another recession was inevitable at some point and that Theresa May\u2019s failure to win a parliamentary majority in last month\u2019s election left the public finances more vulnerable to being blown off course than they were in 2007. In its first in-depth analysis of the fiscal risks facing Britain, the OBR said its main message was clear: \u201cGovernments should expect nasty fiscal surprises from time to time \u2013 because policy can only reduce risks, not eliminate them \u2013 and plan accordingly. \u201cAnd they have to do so in the context of ongoing pressures that are likely to weigh on receipts and drive up spending and a variety of risks that governments choose to expose themselves to for policy reasons. This is true for any government, but this one also has to manage the uncertainties posed by Brexit, which could influence the likelihood or impact of other risks.\u201d The OBR said the size of the UK\u2019s Brexit divorce bill \u2013 currently a matter of dispute between London and Brussels \u2013 would have little impact on the public finances. But it noted that even a small fall in Britain\u2019s underlying growth rate after departure from the EU would lead to a big increase in the country\u2019s debt burden. If a knock to trade with the rest of Europe caused productivity to slip by just 0.1 percentage points over the next 50 years, tax receipts would be \u00a336bn lower. With spending growth left unchanged, the debt-to-GDP ratio would end up around 50 percentage points higher, the OBR added. The campaign group Open Britain said the OBR\u2019s report showed \u201ca hard Brexit poses a real threat to our economy. People voted for \u00a3350m a week for the NHS, not a \u00a336bn black hole in the public finances that could mean severe cuts to the NHS\u201d. The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, said years of austerity and the decision to gamble on a general election victory had left Britain in a weaker position going into the Brexit talks. \u201cThe Tories want to blame Brexit for their failures on the economy. But what this report really reveals is that one of the biggest risks to our economy is Theresa May\u2019s weak government and the last seven years of economic failure,\u201d he said. The Liberal Democrat spokesman Vince Cable warned that the underlying weakness of government tax receipts and a \u201creckless approach to Brexit\u201d were a toxic recipe likely to damage the economy. \u201cEven a small deterioration in growth could mean billions of pounds less funding for our public services in the long term,\u201d he said. The OBR noted that Brexit was not the only threat to the government\u2019s aim of eliminating the UK\u2019s budget deficit. It said a hung parliament and \u201causterity fatigue\u201d, alongside longer-term developments such as a rapidly ageing population, were also factors putting upward pressure on the deficit. The almost inevitable likelihood of a recession in the years ahead, along with higher interest rates and inflation, also posed significant risks to the public finances, threatening to put them on an \u201cunsustainable path\u201d. Robert Chote, the OBR\u2019s chairman, explained that government could be landed with a higher interest bill on its debt mountain after selling billions of pounds worth of bonds with an interest rate linked to the retail prices index. A rise in inflation would add billions of pounds to the cost of financing the UK\u2019s debts, he said. The warning comes as the chancellor, Phillip Hammond, prepares the ground for his autumn budget, which he has already said should stick to current plans to bring down the deficit by the mid-2020s. Ministers are known to have begun lobbying for more funds to give additional support to creaking services and offset the most painful cuts in welfare spending. The deficit is due to rise from 2.4% last year to 2.9% this year following a deterioration in the economic outlook and could go higher if pressure on the Treasury to open the spending taps is successful. The OBR said: \u201cOngoing challenges must be faced while negotiating Brexit and in an environment of \u2018austerity fatigue\u2019. [The government] also faces them from a starting fiscal position that is more vulnerable than that which prevailed on the eve of the crisis 10 years ago.\u201d Hammond described the report as a \u201csober analysis\u201d and a \u201cstark reminder of why we must deliver on our commitment to deal with our country\u2019s debts\u201d. He added: \u201cThe Labour party would ignore these warning signs from the OBR, adding to the bill that our younger generation will have to pay.\u201d To judge the sensitivity of the public finances to shocks, the OBR replicated the Bank of England\u2019s stress tests earlier this year on high street banks, which checked their finances were sound and they were holding sufficient reserves to guard against nasty shocks. A stress test of the government\u2019s plans to manage the public finances revealed that the annual deficit could rocket back to 8.1% and the debt to GDP ratio could match Italy\u2019s at 114%. The annual deficit for the last financial year was 2.6% of GDP \u2013 the lowest since 2007-08 \u2013 and the debt-to-GDP ratio is 85%. Compared with the OBR\u2019s forecast in March, the risks add \u00a366.2bn to the deficit in 2017-18, rising to \u00a3158.5bn higher by 2021-22. It said that extra spending by the government would account for almost all the shortfall. A series of measures dropped from the recent finance bill also played a part, the OBR said. The government scrapped 17 measures that were designed to yield \u00a33.5bn for the Treasury. \u201cIt is no longer clear when they will return to parliament to be legislated,\u201d it said.",

A rise in inflation would add billions of pounds to the cost of financing the UK\u2019s debts, he said.</p> <p>The warning comes as the chancellor, Phillip Hammond, prepares the ground for his autumn budget, which he has already said should stick to current plans to bring down the deficit by the mid-2020s.</p> <p>Ministers are known to have begun lobbying for more funds to give additional support to creaking services and offset the most painful cuts in welfare spending.

[The government] also faces them from a starting fiscal position that is more vulnerable than that which prevailed on the eve of the crisis 10 years ago.\u201d</p> <p>Hammond described the report as a \u201csober analysis\u201d and a \u201cstark reminder of why we must deliver on our commitment to deal with our country\u2019s debts\u201d. He added: \u201cThe Labour party would ignore these warning signs from the OBR, adding to the bill that our younger generation will have to pay.\u201d</p> <p>To judge the sensitivity of the public finances to shocks, the OBR replicated the Bank of England\u2019s stress tests earlier this year on high street banks, which checked their finances were sound and they were holding sufficient reserves to guard against nasty shocks.<br></p> <p>A stress test of the government\u2019s plans to manage the public finances revealed that the annual deficit could rocket back to 8.1% and the debt to GDP ratio could match Italy\u2019s at 114%.

It said that extra spending by the government would account for almost all the shortfall.</p> <p>A series of measures dropped from the recent finance bill also played a part, the OBR said.

      "bodyText": "Our economics editor, Larry Elliott, says today\u2019s OBR report shows the shortcomings in government policy since 2010: He writes: It was one of George Osborne\u2019s most effective soundbites. Before, during and after the 2010 general election, the man who served as David Cameron\u2019s chancellor for six years blamed his austerity measures on Labour\u2019s failure to \u201cfix the roof while the sun was shining\u201d. What goes around comes around. The Office for Budget Responsibility was set up by Osborne in 2010 to keep tabs on the state of the public finances free from the clutches of politicians and has now published its first report into the long-term fiscal risks facing Britain. Its message was brutally simple. The UK has had a recession once in every decade since the 1970s and there is a 50% chance of there being another one in the next five years. Recessions play havoc with the public finances: three of those since the 1970s have seen the budget deficit \u2013 the difference between what the government spends and its income in any one year \u2013 rise to 6% or more..... Here\u2019s Larry\u2019s full analysis: If you missed this morning\u2019s report on the UK credit market, then catch up here: Here\u2019s our news story on the OBR\u2019s fiscal warnings, for anyone just tuning in: UK public finances face twin threat from Brexit and downturn, says OBR Britain\u2019s public finances are in worse shape to withstand a recession than they were on the eve of the financial crash a decade ago and face the twin threat of a fresh downturn and Brexit, the Treasury\u2019s independent forecaster has warned. The Office for Budget Responsibility \u2013 the UK\u2019s fiscal watchdog \u2013 said another recession was inevitable at some point and that Theresa May\u2019s failure to win a parliamentary majority in last month\u2019s election had left the public finances more vulnerable to being blown off course than they were in 2007. In its first in-depth analysis of the fiscal risks facing Britain, the OBR said its main message was clear: \u201cGovernments should expect nasty fiscal surprises from time to time \u2013 because policy can only reduce risks, not eliminate them \u2013 and plan accordingly. \u201cAnd they have to do so in the context of ongoing pressures that are likely to weigh on receipts and drive up spending and a variety of risks that governments choose to expose themselves to for policy reasons. This is true for any government, but this one also has to manage the uncertainties posed by Brexit, which could influence the likelihood or impact of other risks.\u201d The OBR said the size of the UK\u2019s Brexit divorce bill \u2013 currently a matter of dispute between London and Brussels \u2013 would have little impact on the public finances. But it noted that even a small fall in Britain\u2019s underlying growth rate after departure from the EU would lead to a big increase in the country\u2019s debt burden. \u201cIf GDP and receipts grew just 0.1 percentage points more slowly than projected over the next 50 years, but spending growth was unchanged, the debt-to-GDP would end up around 50 percentage points higher,\u201d the OBR said. The OBR noted that Brexit was not the only threat to the government\u2019s aim of eliminating the UK\u2019s budget deficit. It said a hung parliament and \u201causterity fatigue\u201d, alongside longer-term developments such as a rapidly ageing population, were also factors putting upward pressure on the deficit... More here: In other news.... the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefit has fallen, for the first time in a month. The initial jobless claims fell to 247,000 last week, from 250,000. That suggests the US labo(u)r market is still pretty robust. You can read the full OBR report yourself, here. Britain\u2019s economy has failed a fiscal \u2018stress test\u2019 created to see how it would cope with a new financial crisis. The test, published in the OBR\u2019s fiscal report today, models the impact of a deep recession, a tumbling stock market and a sterling crisis, which creates \u201clasting effects on potential output\u201d. And the bad news is that Britain would suffer \u2018severe\u2019 fiscal effects: The deficit would rise to 8.1% of GDP by 2021-22 (of which 7.4% would be structural, and couldn\u2019t simply be grown away) The national debt would rise to 114% of GDP (compared to 85% today) The deficit would be \u00a366.2bn higher in 2017-18, rising to \u00a3158.5 billion higher by 2021-22 And to sum up: The Government\u2019s fiscal targets would be missed by wide margins. This chart shows the full damage, and explains why the OBR fears Britain is in a vulnerable position when the next crisis strikes. Labour\u2019s shadow chancellor has also responded: The chancellor, Philip Hammond, has described the OBR\u2019s report as: \u201ca stark reminder of why we must deliver on our commitment to deal with our country\u2019s debts\u201d. The broad message from the Office for Budget Responsibility is that Britain\u2019s public finances are in a troubling state, vulnerable to nasty surprises, and with a shedload of troubles looming on the horizons. And Brexit could make this whole situation worse, as slower growth over the long term could drive the debt/GDP ratio into the danger zone, over 100%. Today\u2019s report reaches three main conclusions: 1) The government must keep \u201cendogenous risks under review\u201d. That means risks created or influenceable by government policy - everything from the pension triple-lock to the cost of cleaning up Britain\u2019s nuclear power stations. The problem, I suspect, is that there may not be many votes in dealing with certain risks.... 2) Britain must prepare for shocks. There may not be a recession this year. Or in 2018. But there will be one eventually, so future budgets need to create some fiscal space to react. According to the OBR, Britain will suffer at least one financial crisis and several recessions over the next 50 years. And even if the government avoids a classic economic downturn, the economy could be hurt by a natural disaster, a terror attack or a war. 3) Ministers must deal with many sources of slow-building pressure. Britain has a nasty habit of putting off difficult decisions or unpleasant problems (for example, social care for the elderly). But problems don\u2019t go away if you ignore them. They just build up. This chart shows how the ratio between retirees and workers will rise steadily over the next few decades. More old people will need support, and the pool of taxpayers won\u2019t grow fast enough to keep pace. Political and financial journalists and commentators are trawling through today\u2019s Fiscal Risks report, and tweeting the key points and hidden gems. Here are some of the best so far: Today\u2019s Fiscal Risks report includes this chart, showing the key threats to Britain\u2019s public finances: The cost of supporting Britain\u2019s ageing population is the biggest single pressure on public spending, says the OBR. Today\u2019s report states: Pressures on public spending abound. By far the biggest relate to health, where an ageing population is raising demand while technological advances raise costs. Ageing also creates pressures on adult social care and the state pension \u2013 which each face policy-driven cost pressures in the form of the National Living Wage and the triple lock respectively. But there are many other pressure too. The OBR suggests: The uncertain costs of cleaning up nuclear power stations, compensating victims of clinical negligence and reimbursing tax that the courts determine should not have been collected. In the near term the Government may also need to finance an extensive programme of fire safety measures in the wake of the Grenfell Tower tragedy. All these have to be considered in the context of medium-term spending plans that imply significant real terms cuts in spending per person over the next three years, on top of those implemented since 2010. And on the increasingly unpopular 1% public sector pay cap... the OBR cautions that the money would have to come from somewhere.... Lifting current limits on public sector pay increases would pose a fiscal challenge to the extent that departments had their budgets increased to pay for it, rather than simply giving them greater flexibility over how they manage their pay bills. The Office For Budget Responsibility is also critical of the state of the UK public finances. The independent watchdog warns that Britain is \u201cmuch more sensitive to interest rate and inflation surprises\u201d than in the past -- hardly a ringing endorsement of the government\u2019s handling of the economy. It says: We produce this report at a sensitive time. A decade after the outbreak of the financial crisis and recession, net borrowing is well down from its peak. But the budget is still in deficit by 2 to 3 per cent of GDP \u2013 as it was on the eve of the crisis \u2013 and net debt is more than double its pre-crisis share of GDP and not yet falling. As a result, the public finances are much more sensitive to interest rate and inflation surprises than they were. The OBR also highlights the recent turmoil in Westminster: In terms of the political backdrop, the previous Government had to abandon a number of measures to increase taxes and cut welfare spending, the new Government has just agreed a \u2018confidence and supply\u2019 arrangement that increases public spending significantly in Northern Ireland and the Chancellor of the Exchequer notes of austerity that \u201cpeople are weary of the long slog\u201d. The OBR also identifies \u2018austerity fatigue\u2019 as a threat to the government\u2019s control of the fiscal purse strings. The OBR makes a very important point about Brexit. The long-term impact of leaving the EU will have a bigger impact on Britain\u2019s long-term fiscal heath than the upfront cost of exiting the EU. And a small hit to growth over the long term would drive Britain\u2019s national debt dramatically higher. In today\u2019s report, the watchdog says: The new Government must also manage the risks posed by Brexit. These do not supplant the possible shocks and likely pressures that we have already discussed, but they could affect the likelihood and impact of many of them. A lot of attention focuses on the possible \u2018divorce bill\u2019, but, while some numbers mooted for it are very large, a one-off hit of this sort would not pose a big threat to fiscal sustainability. More important are the implications of whatever agreements are reached with the EU and other trading partners for the long-term growth of the UK economy, which we do not attempt to predict here. If GDP and receipts grew just 0.1 percentage points more slowly than projected over the next 50 years, but spending growth was unchanged, the debt-to-GDP would end up around 50 percentage points higher. Britain\u2019s debt-to-GDP ratio is currently 85%, so you can see how significant slower growth would be over half a century.... The chance of a recession in any five-year period is around one in two, says the OBR. And financial crises come along too often for comfort too. The OBR says: The chance of a financial crisis in any five-year period is around one in four, but thankfully not all are as big or as costly as the most recent one. Breaking: The Office for Budget Responsibility, Britain\u2019s fiscal watchdog, has just published its latest Fiscal Risk report. It urges the UK government to prepare for \u2018unexpected\u2019 surprises (and not the nice sort, either), given its \u201cvulnerable fiscal position and a challenging political environment\u201d. The report points out that Britain\u2019s budget is still in deficit by 2 to 3 per cent of GDP \u2013 as it was on the eve of the crisis \u2013 and net debt is more than double its pre-crisis share of GDP and not yet falling. The OBR says that Westminster should remember that recessions and financial crises are \u201calmost inevitable over a 50-year horizon\u201d, and plan accordingly. The main message is clear: governments should expect nasty fiscal surprises from time to time \u2013 because policy can only reduce risks, not eliminate them \u2013 and plan accordingly. And they have to do so in the context of ongoing pressures that are likely to weigh on receipts and drive up spending and a variety of risks that governments choose to expose themselves to for policy reasons. This is true for any government, but this one also has to manage the uncertainties posed by Brexit, which could influence the likelihood or impact of other risks. And for that reason, the OBR says, the Treasury should be cautious of signing off unfunded spending commitments. But new unfunded \u2018giveaways\u2019 would take the Government further away from its medium-term fiscal objective and would only add to the longer-term challenges. In many recent fiscal events, giveaways today have been financed by the promise of takeaways tomorrow. The risk there, of course, is that tomorrow never comes. More to follow.... AstraZeneca is the biggest faller on the FTSE 100 index, with investors unnerved by a media report that chief executive Pascal Soriot has been offered a job by Israel\u2019s Teva Pharmaceutical Industries. AstraZeneca declined to comment, saying it never comments on market speculation. Its shares fell more than 5% in early trading and were later down 4.7% at \u00a349.49. Financial news website Calcalist said Soriot would earn twice as much as his predecessor at Teva and receive a signing-on bonus of about $20m, although the financial terms were still being discussed. Teva has been without a permanent CEO since February when Erez Vigodman stepped down, and its finance chief Eyal Desheh resigned at the end of last month. Soriot has run Britain\u2019s second-biggest drugmaker since 2012 and famously fought off a takeover approach from American rival Pfizer at \u00a355 a share in 2014. He has focused on rebuilding the drug pipeline to replace lost revenues after a string of patent expiries on blockbuster medicines, by investing in areas such as immuno-oncology \u2013 drugs that harness the body\u2019s immune system to fight cancer. The Bank of England\u2019s credit survey has also found that demand for buy-to-let loans has fallen. That may show that recent tax changes, which make BTL less profitable, are hitting demand. Other mortgage lending remained solid, though. The BoE says: Lenders reported that demand for secured lending for house purchase was unchanged in Q2 (Chart 3 below). Within this, demand for prime lending increased and demand for buy-to-let lending decreased significantly. Lenders expected total demand for secured lending for house purchase to increase in Q3, driven by an increase in buy-to-let lending and a slight increase in prime lending. Demand for remortgaging was reported to have decreased slightly in Q2, but was expected to be unchanged in Q3. Back in April, the government began cutting back at the interest relief enjoyed by BTL landlords. Those changes will stop them deducting mortgage interest and other finance-related costs from their rental income before calculating their tax liability. Some landlords say their total tax bill will soar, making buy-to-let much less financially attractive.... Cambridge economics professor Victoria Bateman is concerned by the rise in credit card defaults: Economist Rupert Seggins shows why we should take the Bank\u2019s survey seriously: In an alarming development, more people are defaulting on their credit card bills and other unsecured loans. The Bank of England\u2019s survey of credit conditions has found that the default rates on both credit card and other unsecured lending to UK households have \u201cincreased significantly\u201d in the second quarter of this year. Worryingly, defaults are \u201cexpected to increase further on credit card lending\u201d in the third quarter. That\u2019s a sign that UK households are struggling to meet their financial obligations, perhaps because inflation is now outstripping wage growth. As this chart shows, there was a sharp jump in the number of lenders reporting that default rates have risen. Newsflash: The availability of credit in the UK economy is likely to fall this summer. That\u2019s according to the Bank of England\u2019s latest credit conditions survey. It suggests that banks and other lenders are becoming more cautious about making new loans, reflecting caution over Britain\u2019s economic prospects. The survey found that there will be less \u2018secured credit\u2019, such as a mortgage, on offer over the next quarter. This will particular affect people who only have a small deposit for their house. The Bank of England says: The availability of secured credit to households was reported to have increased in the three months to mid-June 2017 (Chart 1 below), driven by lenders\u2019 market share objectives. But lenders expect availability to fall slightly over the next three months to mid-September, reflecting a changing appetite for risk. Lenders expect that slight reduction in availability to affect only borrowers with loan to value (LTV) ratios of more than 75%, and in particular those with a LTV ratio of more than 90%. Lenders also told the BoE that the availability of unsecured credit (such as credit cards) dropped in the last three months. It will probably continue to decline as lending criteria are tightened up.... Lenders reported that the availability of unsecured credit to households had decreased in Q2 (Chart 2), and expected a further decrease in Q3. A changing appetite for risk was reported to be an important driver of this in Q2 and Q3, with a changing economic outlook also affecting expectations for Q3. Credit scoring criteria for granting both credit card and other unsecured loans were reported to have tightened again in Q2, with lenders expecting further tightening in Q3. Troubled construction group Carillion is having another bad day. Shares have hit fresh record lows this morning, as the shock profit warning issued on Monday continues to alarm investors. They fell as low as 51p, down another 10% today. That meant Carillion has lost almost three quarters (!) of its value this week, since shocking shareholders by taking a monster\u00a3845m provision against contract losses. Analysts believe Carillion needs to raise \u00a3500m in fresh capital to avoid collapse - or more than double its current value. My colleague Simon Goodley explains what went terribly badly wrong: For many, the morning of 8 July promised a feast of sport: the British Lions Test in New Zealand, a Lord\u2019s Test and Wimbledon. But a small group of bankers were about to have their weekend ruined by a summons to an emergency meeting in London\u2019s Maddox Street. Board papers had been delivered to the homes of the directors of Carillion, a FTSE 250 business best known as a builder that works on huge construction projects, and the documents contained disturbing news. A review of the group\u2019s finances, commissioned two months earlier from accountants KPMG, had unearthed a gaping hole in the accounts. Meetings through Saturday and Sunday produced an 800-word statement to the stock exchange, which shocked the City when it was released at 7am on Monday morning. It was a monster profit warning following an \u00a3845m writedown, of which \u00a3375m related to three large public private partnership (PPP) contracts in the UK and \u00a3470m to the cost of pulling out of several markets in the Middle East and Canada.... Over in the City, shares in home shopping group N Brown have slumped by 8% in early trading. The company has just admitted that it sold flawed insurance products for many years, and faces a \u00a340m bill to put it right. The pound is also rallying against the euro, up 0.4% at \u20ac1.133. That takes sterling away from the eight-month low of \u20ac1.119 struck yesterday. The pound has jumped after Ian McCafferty\u2019s comments about possibly unwinding QE early hit the wires. Sterling has gained more than half a cent against the US dollar, to $1.295. That adds to yesterday\u2019s gains, when the US dollar fell generally following Janet Yellen\u2019s testimony. A Bank of England policymaker has spiced up the growing debate over UK monetary policy, by calling for an early end to its huge quantitative easing programme. Ian McCafferty, who is one of the most hawkish members of the Monetary Policy Committee, argued that the BoE should rethink its current policy of not unwinding QE until interest rates have risen close to more normal levels. Speaking to The Times, McCafferty point out that the Federal Reserve is already outlining plans to normalise its balance sheet: Given that other central banks are thinking about it, I think it would be remiss of us not to at least think about it. The Bank of England currently holds \u00a3435bn of debt (mostly government bonds), bought with newly created money during the financial crisis. QE drove up asset prices, pushed down Britain\u2019s borrowing costs, and (apparently) stimulated the economy. Unwinding the programme is going to be tricky, and could easily drive up the long-term cost of borrowing - crucially important to banks, mortgage-payers and governments alike. The Bank of England has previously explained that QE wouldn\u2019t be touched until interest rates had returned to 2% (they\u2019re just 0.25% today). McCafferty also dropped a loud hint that he is planning to vote for an interest rate hike in August - as he did in June. He said: As of today, I would not be changing my position. This means that August\u2019s crunch meeting is likely to see a big split at the Bank; Michael Saunders is also expected to vote to hike borrowing costs, and there\u2019s speculation that chief economist Andy Haldane could join the hawks too. McCafferty argued that the UK economy could handle higher interest rates, pointing out that the jobless rate has hit a 42-year low. He also warned that inflation is likely to \u201cpeak at over 3 percent\u201d - well over the BoE\u2019s 2% target. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. World stock markets are pushing higher today as investors digest yesterday\u2019s testimony from Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen to Congress. Asian stock markets have hit a two-year high, following gains on Wall Street, after Yellen was more dovish than expected. The Fed chair signalled that US interest rates will continue to rise gradually, and singled out weak inflation as a key factor. As Michael Hewson of CMC Markets explains: Equity markets jumped sharply yesterday with the Dow hitting a new record high, while the US dollar slumped after Fed chief Janet Yellen caught investors by surprise by leaning back from the prospect of multiple rate hikes in the coming months. Market reaction was also reinforced by her comments that inflation was running below target and that rates wouldn\u2019t need to rise much further to get back to neutral. This comment in particular suggests that the Fed believes that a lot of the heavy lifting on rates may well have been done in the short term, which may help explain why we saw long term yields slip back down to a one week low, and certainly takes a September rate rise off the table. European markets romped ahead during Yellen\u2019s testimony, and are expected to hold onto those gains this morning But the mood could change at 9.30am, when the latest UK consumer credit figures are released. They will show whether Britons have been hitting their credit cards, to cope with the fact wages aren\u2019t keeping up with prices. The data could also show whether lenders have been more cautious about extending credit. RBC Capital Markets say: Last time the survey indicated that lenders were anticipating tightening conditions on unsecured household lending so this edition will reveal whether or not that intention came to fruition. We also get the latest US weekly jobs report, while Janet Yellen will head back to Capitol Hill for a second day of testimony. Here\u2019s the agenda: 9.30am: Bank of England credit conditions survey 1.30pm: US weekly initial jobless claims figures 3pm: Janet Yellen testifies to the Senate banking committee",

This is true for any government, but this one also has to manage the uncertainties posed by Brexit, which could influence the likelihood or impact of other risks.\u201d</p> <p>The OBR said the size of the UK\u2019s Brexit divorce bill \u2013 currently a matter of dispute between London and Brussels \u2013 would have little impact on the public finances. But it noted that even a small fall in Britain\u2019s underlying growth rate after departure from the EU would lead to a big increase in the country\u2019s debt burden.</p> <p>\u201cIf GDP and receipts grew just 0.1 percentage points more slowly than projected over the next 50 years, but spending growth was unchanged, the debt-to-GDP would end up around 50 percentage points higher,\u201d the OBR said.</p> <p>The OBR noted that Brexit was not the only threat to the government\u2019s aim of eliminating the UK\u2019s budget deficit.

The owner J&amp;F, part of the business empire of Brazil\u2019s disgraced Batista family, said it had sold an 86% stake in the sandal maker for R3.5bn (\u00a3844m) to a consortium of wealthy investors. The Batistas were fined R$10.3bn (\u00a32.5bn) in May after brothers Joesley and Wesley Batista confessed to bribing almost 1,900 politicians to obtain cheap government loans for their businesses. The scandal has reached the top of Brazilian politics with President Michel Temer among those accused of corruption. Made by the S\u00e3o Paulo-based Alpargatas, Havaianas turned what had previously been overlooked as functional footwear into a fashion phenomenon with Gywneth Paltrow and Jennifer Aniston among the celebrity fans. The brand was launched in the early 1960s, with the name \u201cHavaianas\u201d derived from the Portuguese word for Hawaiians.

    "webTitle": "RBS to pay $5.5bn penalty over US loan misselling scandal", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Royal Bank of Scotland has been ordered to pay $5.5bn (\u00a34.2bn) to US regulators for misselling toxic mortgage bonds in a \u201cstark reminder\u201d of its behaviour in the run-up to the financial crisis. The penalty from the Federal Housing Finance Agency is one element of a multibillion-pound bill that the 71% taxpayer-owned bank faces to resolve long-running disputes with authorities in the US over the sale of mortgages packaged into bonds more than a decade ago. Ross McEwan, chief executive of RBS, said: \u201cThis settlement is a stark reminder of what happened to this bank before the financial crisis, and the heavy price paid for its pursuit of global ambitions. This bank and British taxpayers have paid a high price for these poor decisions. \u201cToday\u2019s announcement is an important step forward in resolving one of the most significant legacy matters facing RBS and is further evidence of the determination of the bank\u2019s leadership to put our remaining issues behind us.\u201d Since its bailout in 2008, RBS has incurred penalties and legal costs of \u00a315bn. The Edinburgh-based bank is facing another punishment from the US Department of Justice for the same activities, which could cost a further \u00a39bn, and admitted it had not yet engaged in talks about a settlement in this matter. The FHFA penalty relates to the way that $32bn of mortgages were packaged up and sold as residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) between 2005 and 2007, when RBS was the largest non-US bank engaged in this practice. The bonds were sold to US housing agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac \u2013 the linchpin of the housing market as they buy mortgages from lenders to allow them to grant more home loans \u2013 before the market collapsed during the financial crisis, leaving the buyers nursing heavy losses. The settlement does not include any admission of wrongdoing by the bank, which shut down the bond-selling operation \u2013 once known as Greenwich NatWest \u2013 three years ago. McEwan said the team involved in selling these RMBS had left by then. Analysts at Jefferies said the FHFA bill was $1bn more than they had been expecting, although it is largely covered by existing provisions. RBS shares ended 2% lower at 251.5p \u2013 below the 500p at which taxpayers break even on their stake. McEwan said: \u201cIt\u2019s never a great experience as a CEO to be writing such a large cheque ... Unfortunately, this is the price we\u2019re paying to get this organisation into a much better shape.\u201d Ahead of the FHFA settlement, the bank had put aside \u00a36.6bn to cover the cost of RMBS misselling and the penalty from the FHFA accounted for \u00a33.6bn of this. The total bill for RBS falls to \u00a33.6bn because of indemnity agreements but the bank admitted it will need to take another \u00a3151m provision to cover the rest of the FHFA settlement. FHFA filed 18 lawsuits in 2011 in relation to RMBS misselling and the settlement with RBS is the 17th and one of the largest. It is not clear how much of the remaining \u00a33bn of provisions is in preparation for any settlement with the DoJ, which McEwan has said he wants to resolve by the end of this year. \u201cAs the year progresses it gets increasingly challenging [to solve this by the end of the year],\u201d Ewen Stevenson, finance director of RBS, told analysts.

This bank and British taxpayers have paid a high price for these poor decisions.</p> <p>\u201cToday\u2019s announcement is an important step forward in resolving one of the most significant legacy matters facing RBS and is further evidence of the determination of the bank\u2019s leadership to put our remaining issues behind us.\u201d</p> <p>Since its bailout in 2008, RBS has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/feb/24/90bn-in-bills-since-2008-how-did-rbs-get-here-financial-crisis-\">incurred penalties and legal costs of \u00a315bn</a>.<br></p> <p>The Edinburgh-based bank is facing another punishment from the US Department of Justice for the same activities, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/25/rbs-braced-for-multi-billion-pound-settlement-for-loan-misselling-scandal\">which could cost a further \u00a39bn</a>, and admitted it had not yet engaged in talks about a settlement in this matter.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The FHFA penalty relates to the way that $32bn of mortgages were packaged up and sold as residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) between 2005 and 2007, when RBS was the largest non-US bank engaged in this practice. The bonds were sold to US housing agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac \u2013 the linchpin of the housing market as they buy mortgages from lenders to allow them to grant more home loans \u2013 before the market collapsed during the financial crisis, leaving the buyers nursing heavy losses.</p> <p>The settlement does not include any admission of wrongdoing by the bank, which shut down the bond-selling operation \u2013 once known as Greenwich NatWest \u2013 three years ago. McEwan said the team involved in selling these RMBS had left by then. </p> <p>Analysts at Jefferies said the FHFA bill was $1bn more than they had been expecting, although it is largely covered by existing provisions. RBS shares ended 2% lower at 251.5p \u2013 below the 500p at which taxpayers break even on their stake.</p> <p>McEwan said: \u201cIt\u2019s never a great experience as a CEO to be writing such a large cheque ... Unfortunately, this is the price we\u2019re paying to get this organisation into a much better shape.\u201d</p> <p>Ahead of the FHFA settlement, the bank had put aside \u00a36.6bn to cover the cost of RMBS misselling and the penalty from the FHFA accounted for \u00a33.6bn of this. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The total bill for RBS falls to \u00a33.6bn because of indemnity agreements but the bank admitted it will need to take another \u00a3151m provision to cover the rest of the FHFA settlement.</p> <p>FHFA filed 18 lawsuits in 2011 in relation to RMBS misselling and the settlement with RBS is the 17th and one of the largest.</p> <p>It is not clear how much of the remaining \u00a33bn of provisions is in preparation for any settlement with the DoJ, which McEwan has said he wants to resolve by the end of this year. \u201cAs the year progresses it gets increasingly challenging [to solve this by the end of the year],\u201d Ewen Stevenson, finance director of RBS, told analysts.</p> <p>McEwan said the settlement with the FHFA was a \u201cgood step forward\u201d but did not solve all the barriers facing the bank\u2019s ability to start paying dividends for the first time in a decade.</p> <p>The bank also needs to make a profit \u2013 McEwan has already warned that the bank is course to report 10 years of consecutive annual losses since its \u00a345bn bailout \u2013 and pass its annual stress test from the Bank of England.

      "bodyText": "Southern rail\u2019s owner has been fined \u00a313.4m by the government, prompting a Commons clash with Labour over whether the company or unions were primarily to blame for two years of disruption to services between London and Brighton. The long-awaited ruling over whether Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR) breached its contract by failing to run services was described as a fair outcome by the company, but denounced as \u201cless than a slap on the wrist\u201d by unions. Labour said it meant the government was \u201cfinally coming clean\u201d over GTR\u2019s role in Southern\u2019s troubles. However, Southern trains are now set to be stopped for three further days in August by a fresh drivers\u2019 strike, after members of Aslef voted to reject a pay deal, in a ballot result announced hours after GTR\u2019s fine. The fine handed down by the Department for Transport (DfT) effectively means the government holds GTR partly responsible for the past two years of cancellations and delays on Southern, but accepts its arguments that industrial action and unusual levels of staff sickness were the major reasons for failing to run an adequate service. The announcement comes on the final day of a high court-imposed deadline for Chris Grayling, the transport secretary, to respond to GTR\u2019s claim of \u201cforce majeure\u201d, prompted by legal action from the Association of British Commuters, which was seeking a judicial review of ministers\u2019 handling of the franchise. GTR\u2019s claim was lodged more than a year ago as it became clear that Southern\u2019s performance fell well short of its contractual obligations, prompting calls for the company to be stripped of the franchise. Writing to GTR, Grayling said that DfT officials had determined that, while strikes had affected Southern, \u201cthat does not fully explain the poor service that passengers received,\u201d and added that performance was still not good enough. The \u00a313.4m will be spent by the DfT and GTR on a package of improvements to its franchise, including 50 more onboard staff. Charles Horton, the company\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cWe are pleased that this issue has been concluded, and accept and are sorry that our service levels haven\u2019t been good enough for passengers.\u201d Horton added that the franchise was the most congested on the UK rail network and had been operating while stations were being rebuilt and new infrastructure and trains introduced, and the impact of such extensive work was underestimated. But he said trade union action had been the biggest cause of disruption. In the Commons, Labour\u2019s shadow transport secretary, Andy McDonald, said that the fine showed GTR and the government could no longer blame others for Southern\u2019s failures. He said: \u201cWith the record fine imposed today, such nonsense has been totally blown out of the water. \u201cMinisters ... have had to come clean and accept that Southern rail is simply not fit for purpose.\u201d He challenged Grayling: \u201cDoesn\u2019t he now accept that continuing to tolerate such ineptitude, expecting a rail service to rely on workers\u2019 overtime and compromising safety accessibility simply won\u2019t wash any longer, and he now has to call time on GTR?\u201d However, Grayling said he had for months accepted there were many reasons, but added: \u201cI\u2019m also very clear \u2013 and so was Chris Gibb\u2019s report \u2013 that the prime responsibility for the trouble on that network in the last few months has come from trade unions fighting the battles of 30 years ago.\u201d The Gibb report was written in December and belatedly released by the DfT last month under pressure from campaigners. While Gibb said union action was the \u201cprimary cause\u201d of the Southern\u2019s meltdown, he highlighted a range of problems including the need for an immediate \u00a3300m investment in infrastructure to keep services running. Grayling added that the Aslef ballot was an example of what was disrupting Southern. He said: \u201cThis is a politically motivated set of threats of action and it should stop, and the Labour party should stop supporting it.\u201d Aslef announced its drivers would strike on Tuesday 1 August, Wednesday 2 August and Friday 4 August, after rejecting a five-year pay deal. In the parallel dispute about driver-only operation of trains - the main row affecting Southern - the union has taken a total of six days\u2019 strike action, on which days none of the company\u2019s trains ran at all. It is also continuing an overtime ban. Drivers voted by 62%-38% for a strike, and by almost four to one in favour of action short of a strike. Mick Whelan, general secretary of Aslef, said: \u201cNow is the time for Chris Grayling and the Department for Transport to step in and assist in finding a resolution to a problem they caused.\u201d The RMT denounced the ruling. Its general secretary, Mick Cash, said: \u201cThis latest whitewash of the Southern rail shambles by the government is hardly a surprise when they\u2019ve been up to their necks in this fiasco right from day one. This pathetic response to the abject failure by GTR to deliver on their contract doesn\u2019t even stack up to a slap on the wrist.\u201d Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, repeated his call to take over suburban routes on Southern. He said: \u201cThis fine will be absolutely no consolation for hard-pressed commuters who have been forced to suffer a litany of appalling service and spiralling fares. \u201cMinisters need to break up this failing licence now and allow TFL to take over the suburban routes to ensure passengers are given the service they truly deserve.\u201d GTR\u2019s owner, Go-Ahead Group, which operates other rail franchises including Southeastern, said the fine was in line with its forecasts and resolved financial uncertainty. The amount could yet be increased, or softened, by up to \u00a35m as the company discusses other aspects of its \u201ccontractual variations\u201d with the DfT, including revised timetables and how quickly new trains were introduced.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A dramatic growth in electric vehicles on Britain\u2019s roads could see peak electricity demand jump by more than the capacity of the Hinkley Point C nuclear power station by 2030, according to National Grid. The number of plug-in cars and vans could reach 9m by 2030, up from around 90,000 today, said the company, which runs the UK\u2019s national transmission networks for electricity and gas. The impact of charging so many cars\u2019 batteries would be to reverse the trend in recent years of falling electricity demand, driven by energy efficiency measures such as better refrigerators and LED lighting. If electric vehicles were not charged smartly to avoid peaks and troughs in power demand, such as when people return home between 5pm and 6pm, peak demand could be as much as 8GW higher in 2030, National Grid said. Shifting the charging of cars to times when demand is lower would reduce the extra peak demand to 3.5GW, a smaller amount but still a similar capacity to the new reactors being built at Hinkley Point in Somerset. The forecasts are contained in the grid\u2019s Future Energy Scenarios report, published just days after Volvo said all its new cars would be electric or hybrid from 2019 and France pledged to ban sales of new petrol and diesel cars by 2040. \u201cElectric vehicles are coming \u2013 how quickly is the question,\u201d said Roisin Quinn, head of strategy at National Grid, adding that she expected battery-powered car sales to take off in the mid-2020s. While there was uncertainty over when falling electricity demand would be reversed, she said: \u201cIt\u2019s a big moment when demand starts to go up again.\u201d National Grid acknowledged the cars\u2019 batteries could also provide services and return power for the grid at a time when managing the network is becoming increasingly complex as variable sources of wind and solar power grow. But it cautioned that there was \u201cstill debate over whether it will become commercially viable to flow electricity from a vehicle back onto the network to provide network services\u201d. Quinn said a large share of power from renewables had \u201calready become a reality\u201d, and three of the report\u2019s four scenarios predict that solar power will have the biggest share of generation capacity by 2050. In all of the scenarios, new nuclear power stations are assumed to be built and the capacity of interconnectors that provide backup power from Europe rises from 4GW now to between 10GW and 19GW in 2030. Fracking for shale gas is expected to produce zero gas in two of the greener scenarios. However, in one scenario of high fracking, shale gas is projected to provide 32bn cubic metres by 2031, a similar amount to the 36bn cubic metres the North Sea provided last year. Regardless of how much of the UK\u2019s gas comes from fracking, National Grid sees gas as playing a key role in power and heating for decades. It is not until 2050 in some of the group\u2019s scenarios that alternative, electric heating technologies such as heat pumps begin to overtake gas for keeping homes warm. \u201cThe story around gas is that it\u2019s critical to our supply now and will continue to be in future,\u201d said Quinn. \u201cWe see it as having a long-term role as a reliable, cost effective and flexible energy source, and it will be favoured by many consumers.\u201d But with North Sea gas production declining, National Grid expects the UK\u2019s dependence on gas imports to continue for decades, to some degree. More liquefied natural gas is also expected to be shipped to the UK in the future. Climate change could also pose new challenges, with the UK forecast to get hotter. As temperatures warm, the use of air conditioning in summer could cause peak electricity demand to reach the levels normally seen in winter. National Grid did not take a view on the costs of the scenarios in the report, which was published just a day after a consumer group accused energy networks, including National Grid, of earning \u00a37.5bn in unjustified profits over an eight-year period.",

      "bodyText": "The founder of Sports Direct, Mike Ashley, has added a near 26% stake in the struggling video games retailer Game Digital to his string of high street investments. Game Digital said Sports Direct, controlled by the billionaire, had acquired 44m shares, amounting to a 25.75% stake. Game released a profit warning last month due to a supply shortage of Nintendo\u2019s Switch console and a weaker lineup of new games. Ashley has built up a business empire by buying stakes in Debenhams, French Connection and the home shopping company Findel, through Sports Direct or investment vehicles. Game said in a statement to the London Stock Exchange that it was aware Sports Direct had taken \u201csignificant strategic equity stakes in a number of retail and brand businesses across both the UK and US\u201d, and that it was \u201cpleased that the strategic value of the group has been recognised by Sports Direct\u201d. It added: \u201cThe group looks forward to working collaboratively with Sports Direct to explore the clear opportunities that a constructive partnership and collaboration can deliver for all stakeholders in the gaming, live events and rapidly growing eSports markets in which it operates.\u201d Game shares rose by more than 15% to 28p on the news, and later traded at 26.5p (up 9.3%), giving it a market value of \u00a347m. Three years ago, the retailer was floated at 200p a share by its owner, the US hedge fund Elliott Advisors, with a market value of \u00a3340m, after being rescued from bankruptcy two years earlier. Its shares dived to 21p after the recent profit warning. Game, which has 580 shops in the UK and Spain, has pushed into events and the rapidly growing eSports market, as shopping shifts online and some game developers sell directly to consumers. ESports will be an official medal sport at the 2022 Asian Games in China. The stake acquisition will fuel speculation that Sports Direct could pounce on Game with a takeover offer. Sports Direct, Britain\u2019s second-biggest sports retailer, has been under fire over its working practices since a Guardian investigation revealed that it was in effect paying warehouse staff less than the minimum wage. A report by MPs later accused Ashley of running Sports Direct like a Victorian workhouse. The tycoon, who owns Newcastle United, is also embroiled in a high court dispute, which has heard evidence about his \u201cunorthodox\u201d business practices.",

      "bodyText": "The American shale gas revolution will enjoy a second wind as rapid growth in domestic production sees the US join the world\u2019s club of top gas exporters, a leading energy authority has predicted. Fracking has already opened up US shale oil and gas deposits, leading to a fall in gas prices and a drop in greenhouse gas emissions as power generation switches from coal to gas, as well as reducing America\u2019s historical reliance on fossil fuel imports. But an increase in US gas production over the next five years will cause another revolution as the country begins liquefying and shipping gas to Asia, Europe and the Middle East, the International Energy Agency said. In a report published on Thursday, the IEA forecast the US would generate almost 40% of the rise in global gas output between 2016 and 2022. Come 2022, the US will produce more than a fifth of the world\u2019s gas, putting it on the same level as top gas exporters such as Russia and Norway, the agency predicted. As an exporter of liquefied natural gas (LNG), it would become second biggest in five years, behind Australia but above Gulf state Qatar. \u201cThe US is already the largest gas producer in the world and will increase production more than any other country over the next five years,\u201d said Keisuke Sadamori, director for energy markets and security at the IEA. \u201cUS gas production will grow by nearly 3% a year.\u201d More than half of that new production will be turned into liquefied natural gas for exports, he added. Three major LNG terminals are being built on the Texas coast by Houston-based firms, at a cost of tens of billions of dollars, to export the gas. Last weekend, the first shipment of LNG imported from the US arrived in the UK, to provide about half of the country\u2019s gas needs this summer. That came just weeks after the first US LNG shipment to central Europe, in a delivery to Poland, which is trying to reduce its reliance on Russian gas. However, the big demand growth is predicted to come from Asia. China is anticipated to account for 40% of global demand growth, driven by government policies to tackle the dangerous levels of air pollution in many cities, which is largely caused by coal power stations. \u201cEspecially in China, and more and more other Asian countries, gas is being used in order to reduce the coal and address the local pollution issue,\u201d said Fatih Birol, executive director at the IEA. India would lead growth in the rest of Asia, the report forecast. While Japan is already a big importer of LNG, the IEA said that Seoul\u2019s decision to switch away from coal and nuclear power could see South Korea increase its appetite for LNG too. The sources of demand in those countries will also change, with industry taking over from the power sector as the \u201cmain engine of demand growth\u201d. The IEA cited the examples of the growing use of gas in the chemicals sector and in fertilisers in India. By 2022, the agency said the three giant LNG exporters would be the US, Australia and Qatar, which is undergoing a blockade that the IEA said served as \u201ca reminder that security of gas supply cannot be taken for granted\u201d. Last month, a giant floating LNG vessel set off from a South Korean shipyard to work on Shell\u2019s Prelude gas field off Western Australia, where production is expected to begin in 2018. The report did not assess the impact of Qatar\u2019s recent announcement that it would increase LNG production by 30% within the next seven years. The UK relies on Qatar for nearly a third of its gas imports. Overall, Sadamori said the key factor in the gas market in coming years would be production growth in the US and its emerging role as an exporter. \u201cThe ability of the gas fields in the US to provide large quantities at competitive prices will be the most important feature [of the gas market], not only to keep gas competitive for US power generation and industry customers, but also to further increase pipelines exports to Mexico, Canada and deliver LNG to the global market.\u201d",

As an exporter of liquefied natural gas (LNG), it would become second biggest in five years, behind Australia but above Gulf state Qatar.</p> <p>\u201cThe US is already the largest gas producer in the world and will increase production more than any other country over the next five years,\u201d said Keisuke Sadamori, director for energy markets and security at the IEA. \u201cUS gas production will grow by nearly 3% a year.\u201d </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/27/fracking-digging-drilling-paris-agreement-fossil-fuels\">No fracking, drilling or digging: it\u2019s the only way to save life on Earth | George Monbiot</a> </p> </aside>  <p>More than half of that new production will be turned into liquefied natural gas for exports, he added. </p> <p>Three major LNG terminals are being built on the Texas coast by Houston-based firms, at a cost of tens of billions of dollars, to export the gas. </p> <p>Last weekend, the first shipment of LNG imported from the US arrived in the UK, to provide about half of the country\u2019s gas needs this summer. That came just weeks after the <a href=\"https://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2017/06/271637.htm\">first US LNG shipment to central Europe</a>, in a delivery to Poland, which is trying to reduce its reliance on Russian gas.</p> <p>However, the big demand growth is predicted to come from Asia. China is anticipated to account for 40% of global demand growth, driven by government policies to tackle the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/oct/10/china-pollution-levels-hit-20-times-safe-levels\">dangerous levels of air pollution in many cities</a>, which is largely caused by coal power stations.</p> <p>\u201cEspecially in China, and more and more other Asian countries, gas is being used in order to reduce the coal and address the local pollution issue,\u201d said Fatih Birol, executive director at the IEA.</p> <p>India would lead growth in the rest of Asia, the report forecast. While Japan is already a big importer of LNG, the IEA said that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jun/19/new-south-korean-president-vows-to-end-use-of-nuclear-power\">Seoul\u2019s decision to switch away from coal and nuclear power</a> could see South Korea increase its appetite for LNG too.</p> <p>The sources of demand in those countries will also change, with industry taking over from the power sector as the \u201cmain engine of demand growth\u201d. The IEA cited the examples of the growing use of gas in the chemicals sector and in fertilisers in India.</p> <p>By 2022, the agency said the three giant LNG exporters would be the US, Australia and Qatar, which is undergoing a blockade that the IEA said served as \u201ca reminder that security of gas supply cannot be taken for granted\u201d.</p> <p>Last month, a giant floating LNG vessel <a href=\"http://www.shell.com/media/news-and-media-releases/2017/prelude-flng-begins-its-journey-to-australia.html?cq_ck=1498731147117\">set off from a South Korean shipyard</a> to work on Shell\u2019s Prelude gas field off Western Australia, where production is expected to begin in 2018. </p> <p>The report did not assess the impact of Qatar\u2019s recent announcement that it would increase LNG production by 30% within the next seven years. The UK <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jun/08/qatar-crisis-highlights-rising-uk-energy-reliance-on-imports\">relies on Qatar for nearly a third of its gas imports</a>.</p> <p>Overall, Sadamori said the key factor in the gas market in coming years would be production growth in the US and its emerging role as an exporter.</p> <p>\u201cThe ability of the gas fields in the US to provide large quantities at competitive prices will be the most important feature [of the gas market], not only to keep gas competitive for US power generation and industry customers, but also to further increase pipelines exports to Mexico, Canada and deliver LNG to the global market.\u201d</p>",

But a small group of bankers were about to have their weekend ruined by a summons to an emergency meeting in London\u2019s Maddox Street. Board papers had been delivered to the homes of the directors of Carillion, a FTSE 250 business best known as a builder that works on huge construction projects, and the documents contained disturbing news. A review of the group\u2019s finances, commissioned two months earlier from accountants KPMG, had unearthed a gaping hole in the accounts. Meetings through Saturday and Sunday produced an 800-word statement to the stock exchange, which shocked the City when it was released at 7am on Monday morning. It was a monster profit warning following an \u00a3845m writedown, of which \u00a3375m related to three large public private partnership (PPP) contracts in the UK and \u00a3470m to the cost of pulling out of several markets in the Middle East and Canada. The announcement continued: chief executive Richard Howson had immediately stepped down, and a new interim boss, Keith Cochrane, had been parachuted in to conduct a \u201ccomprehensive review of the business\u201d until a permanent successor was found. Predictably, the shares reacted violently to the news \u2013 slumping 39% on Monday \u2013 but the bloodbath didn\u2019t stop there. They were down again by 33% on Tuesday, plus another 27% on Wednesday, and suddenly a business with annual revenues of \u00a35bn and 48,000 employees was worth less than \u00a3250m. The shares are now changing hands at just 57p \u2013 down from 200p a month ago and 350p two years ago. The City now expects the company will need to raise double that figure just to survive. Sam Cullen, an analyst at investment bank Jefferies, said: \u201cRealistically, we see no future for Carillion without a rights issue of at least \u00a3500m as we believe the group will find it increasingly difficult to win support services work with the balance sheet in its current state\u201d. What is Carillion \u2013 and how did this happen? The company is an intrinsic part of the UK economy, being one of the major contractors to the Highways Agency and to Network Rail, and is essentially set up around three businesses. Firstly, it is perhaps best known for construction, where it has just completed the expansion of the main stand at Anfield and is working on the conversion of Battersea Power Station. Secondly, there is a support services arm, which includes maintenance on buildings and cleaning services. And, thirdly, there is PPP, where it might fund and manage the building of a new NHS hospital. PPP is one of those financial inventions that was sold as being a win-win for both sides. The government might get some new infrastructure more quickly and without having to to pay the huge upfront costs of building it, while the private companies financing the deal gained a valuable long-term income stream - often over 20 years or so. At least, that was the theory. Just three Carillion PPP contracts \u2013 thought to be the Midland Metropolitan hospital in Smethwick, Merseyside\u2019s Royal Liverpool hospital and an Aberdeen road project \u2013 are behind the bulk of the \u00a3375m losses that relate to the UK. Industry watchers say that project delays \u2013 caused by such astonishing occurrences such as cold weather in Aberdeen over the winter \u2013 have introduced huge extra costs. Construction of the Royal Liverpool hospital has also been beset with hold-ups, most recently after after workers found \u201cextensive\u201d asbestos on site and cracks in the new building. Meanwhile, just before the profit warning, it was revealed that another Carillion project \u2013 an experimental tram-train linking Sheffield and Rotherham \u2013 has cost more than five times the agreed budget and is running almost three years late. The government has been forced to compensate tram operator Stagecoach for the delays with a \u00a32.5m payment. These types of setback are frequent complaints of investors in the sector and is one of the reasons the City has long taken a dim view of Carillion. For months, the company has been one of the UK stock market\u2019s most shorted companies \u2013 meaning that investors have been placing bets on a fall in the company\u2019s share price. The short-sellers have also been motivated by Carillion\u2019s dependence on support services, which account for about 70% of operating profits and an area where companies regularly embarrass themselves with overly optimistic profit forecasts. All of which means that City analysts are now speculating that the company could run out of cash \u2013 with those at Liberum wondering if it might breach a banking \u201cfacility\u201d, effectively the company\u2019s overdraft. Carillion also has a pension deficit of \u00a3587m to deal with. The company has outlined a plan to avert all this, including accelerating a plan \u201cto reduce net borrowing\u201d and disposals to raise up to \u00a3125m in the next 12 months. By pulling out of construction in Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Egypt, it is withdrawing from its business in the Middle East almost entirely. Further annual savings will be announced following a \u201cstrategic and operational review\u201d, while the firm also plans to get better at collecting money that it is owed. Will that be prove to be enough? Analysts at UBS say the company can potentially be recapitalised, but it is predicting more hefty share price falls in the short term. Its worst case scenario is particularly frightening: the Swiss bank reckons the shares could fall to zero.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Bank of England should resist increasing interest rates while the direction of the economy remains unclear, according to one of the central bank\u2019s senior policymakers, an announcement that reduces the chances of a rate hike this year. Ben Broadbent, a close ally of BoE governor Mark Carney, said he was not ready to raise interest rates while the the bank\u2019s monetary policy committee (MPC) found it \u201cvery difficult\u201d to judge whether there had been a significant improvement. \u201cIn my opinion, it is a bit tricky at the moment to make a decision [to raise rates]. I am not ready to do it yet,\u201d the deputy governor said. His comments contrasted with those made by the head of the US central bank, Janet Yellen, who said the US economy was strong enough for rates to continue increasing, though to a historically low natural rate, thought to be between 2% and 3%. Yellen\u2019s remarks to Congress sent global stock markets soaring, with the Dow Jones Industrial index reaching a fresh all-time high of 21,535 while the UK\u2019s FTSE 100 index jumped 83 points to 7,416. The German Dax and French CAC leapt by more than 1.5%. Joshua Mahony, a market analyst at spread betting firm IG, said Yellen\u2019s comments were seen as dampening expectations of a steep rise of US rates. \u201cStocks are back in the swing of things, with the Dow hitting new record highs in the wake of a dovish testimony from Janet Yellen in Washington,\u201d he said, in an interview with the Aberdeen Press and Journal. \u201cTo some extent Yellen provided a relatively hawkish statement given her declaration that rate hikes should continue despite falling inflation. However, in speculating that it would not take many more hikes for the Fed funds rate to be neutral, Yellen has essentially signalled that there will be a finite amount of rate rises around the corner. Markets are now looking for a December rate hike at the earliest, and crucially just one rate rise in 2018.\u201d The US and UK have experienced strong jobs growth, but relatively weak increases in average wage growth. The Federal Reserve has pushed ahead with four increases since 2015 that have raised the base rate by 1%, while the UK base rate remains at 0.25%. British policymakers came close last month to raising interest rates for the first time in a decade after three members of the MPC voted for an increase. Investors have keenly awaited Broadbent\u2019s stance on rates, after chief economist Andy Haldane, who voted to keep rates on hold, later hinted that he might switch to the hawkish camp later in the year. Several analysts have said the views of Broadbent \u2013 deputy governor for monetary policy \u2013 would be key to assessing the chances of a first BoE rate hike in a decade. Broadbent said economic growth had been \u201cOK\u201d during the last six to 12 months and pointed to rising employment and inflation. \u201cThere is reason to see the [monetary policy] committee moving in that direction [towards higher interest rates] \u2013 but there are still a lot of imponderables,\u201d he said. Broadbent said many companies would remain nervous about their prospects while they were \u201cone or two years down the road\u201d from knowing what Brexit means. On Tuesday, he said in a speech that a reduction in trade between Britain and the EU would harm both economies and causes prices to rise. New MPC member Silvana Tenreyro, who replaced rate-increase advocate Kristin Forbes this month, has yet to speak on policy.",

      "body": "<p>The Bank of England should resist increasing interest rates while the direction of the economy remains unclear, according to one of the central bank\u2019s senior policymakers, an announcement that reduces the chances of a rate hike this year.</p> <p>Ben Broadbent, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jun/28/bank-of-england-deputy-interest-rate-mpc-cunliffe-mark-carney\">a close ally of BoE governor Mark Carney</a>, said he was not ready to raise interest rates while the the bank\u2019s monetary policy committee (MPC) found it \u201cvery difficult\u201d to judge whether there had been a significant improvement. \u201cIn my opinion, it is a bit tricky at the moment to make a decision [to raise rates]. I am not ready to do it yet,\u201d the deputy governor said.</p> <p>His comments contrasted with those made by the head of the US central bank, Janet Yellen, who said the US economy was strong enough for rates to continue increasing, though to a historically low natural rate, thought to be between 2% and 3%.</p> <p>Yellen\u2019s remarks to Congress sent global stock markets soaring, with the Dow Jones Industrial index reaching a fresh all-time high of 21,535 while the UK\u2019s FTSE 100 index jumped 83 points to 7,416. The German Dax and French CAC leapt by more than 1.5%.</p> <p>Joshua Mahony, a market analyst at spread betting firm IG, said Yellen\u2019s comments were seen as dampening expectations of a steep rise of US rates. \u201cStocks are back in the swing of things, with the Dow hitting new record highs in the wake of a dovish testimony from Janet Yellen in Washington,\u201d he said, in <a href=\"https://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/fp/business/uk-and-abroad/1286655/bank-of-england-deputy-governor-not-ready-to-vote-for-a-rise-in-interest-rates/\" draggable=\"true\">an interview with the Aberdeen Press and Journal</a>. </p> <p>\u201cTo some extent Yellen provided a relatively hawkish statement given her declaration that rate hikes should continue despite falling inflation. However, in speculating that it would not take many more hikes for the Fed funds rate to be neutral, Yellen has essentially signalled that there will be a finite amount of rate rises around the corner. Markets are now looking for a December rate hike at the earliest, and crucially just one rate rise in 2018.\u201d<br></p> <p>The US and UK have experienced strong jobs growth, but relatively weak increases in average wage growth. The Federal Reserve has pushed ahead with four increases since 2015 that have raised the base rate by 1%, while the UK base rate remains at 0.25%. British policymakers came close last month to raising interest rates for the first time in a decade after three members of the MPC voted for an increase. </p> <p>Investors have keenly awaited Broadbent\u2019s stance on rates, after chief economist Andy Haldane, who voted to keep rates on hold, later hinted that he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jun/21/bank-of-england-interest-rate-rise-andy-haldane-mark-carney-mpc\">might switch to the hawkish camp</a> later in the year. Several analysts have said the views of Broadbent \u2013 deputy governor for monetary policy \u2013 would be key to assessing the chances of a first BoE rate hike in a decade.</p> <p>Broadbent said economic growth had been \u201cOK\u201d during the last six to 12 months and pointed to rising employment and inflation. \u201cThere is reason to see the [monetary policy] committee moving in that direction [towards higher interest rates] \u2013 but there are still a lot of imponderables,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Broadbent said many companies would remain nervous about their prospects while they were \u201cone or two years down the road\u201d from knowing what Brexit means. On Tuesday, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jul/11/uk-economy-living-standards-squeeze-s-and-p-interest-rates-brexit\">he said in a speech</a> that a reduction in trade between Britain and the EU would harm both economies and causes prices to rise.</p> <p>New MPC member Silvana Tenreyro, who replaced rate-increase advocate Kristin Forbes this month, has yet to speak on policy.</p>",
