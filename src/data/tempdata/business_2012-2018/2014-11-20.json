    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Nigel Cann has a big job on. A director of EDF Energy, it is his job to deliver the biggest construction project in Europe: the Hinkley Point C nuclear plant, which is needed as soon as possible to help keep Britain\u2019s lights on, and is a project with vast commercial and political capital riding on it. Experience suggests that the construction of the first nuclear reactor constructed in Britain for quarter of a century \u2013 located on the Somerset coast \u2013 will not be straightforward. Similar projects in France and Finland have run into huge delays and cost overruns. This week EDF has put back the completion date of its newbuild project at Flamanville in Normandy while Areva, another Hinkley shareholder and the designer of the reactors, has admitted it may need a financial bailout. Fortunately, Cann is a confident kind of chap. He insists he is not overly daunted by Hinkley and its \u00a325bn price tag \u2013 the equivalent of putting on almost three London Olympics. \u201cI grew up around the Channel Tunnel rail project. Everyone admired those \u2018tunnel tigers\u2019, as they were known, and I want to create the same atmosphere around here.\u201d It is, he says, \u201can honour and a challenge to have this responsibility, but I also feel humble,\u201d adding: \u201cI do not underestimate the job. This is the biggest single foreign investment in this country since world war two.\u201d So what makes him think that EDF and its partner Areva can deliver a working power station in Britain by 2023 \u2013 something they have individually or collectively failed to do on time and on budget with similar European Pressurised Reactors (EPRs) at Flamanville and Olkiluoto in Finland? \u201cWe spend a lot of time reviewing these other projects and finding out what we can learn from them. We have workshops centred on what went wrong. I admit that some of what I have read is quite ugly. \u201cThere has been a lack of attention to detail in places, some miscommunications. We do a lot of scenario-based training on issues such as the quality of concrete, which was an issue at Olkiluoto. But all the parties are sharing their experiences with us and learning is in our DNA.\u201d EDF is also taking experience gained from the 2012 Olympics and Heathrow Terminal 5 \u2013 signing early agreements with trade unions, using \u201cmock-up\u201d sites to practise construction techniques as well as utilising prefabricated and modular parts. Cann is sitting in a glorified portable cabin that acts as a viewing gallery, his shirt sleeves rolled up as if ready to start digging himself. Outside, the rain spatters down on massive yellow earthmoving equipment lumbering around mountains of chocolate-coloured earth. The French company has around 400 people already at work clearing a 175-hectare site next door to Hinkley Point A and B, the first being decommissioned, the latter still operating. Cann\u2019s team is also putting in place roads and roundabouts including a bypass round the small village of Canning so that locals will be saved some of the inconvenience of the 750 trucks a day that will go in an out of the Hinkley site. EDF spent \u00a35m during September alone on Hinkley Point C, whose generous subsidy regime has just been given the all-clear by Brussels, but EDF has yet to make a final investment decision. This will almost certainly come early in the new year. Cann, who previously ran Hinkley Point B and before that another nuclear plant at Dungeness in his native Kent, admits the new job is different. \u201cPeople think there is not very much going on here yet. But it does not feel that way to me. It is different from going into an existing plant. There is very little structure to start with, and you have got to create it. It is very important to be focused on safety, quality and control. That is really easy to talk about but much harder to do.\u201d Only 60% of the Somerset project is nuclear \u2013 the remaining 40% is conventional work, such as building a sea wall and a jetty to bring in aggregates for construction, plus drilling tunnels for cooling pipelines going out to sea. One of the key issues for Cann, he says, is to make sure the local community \u2013 and Britain more widely \u2013 takes as much as it can out of the project, especially in the way of jobs and services. Critics often suggest that these kinds of colossal projects, especially those run by foreign firms, simply suck in skilled foreign workers at the expense of local, and even nuclear experts have repeatedly warned about British skill shortages. By the end of next year, he expects to have 2,000 workers on site, moving up to 5,600 at peak time, and Cann is aiming for 24% of recruits to come from Somerset and 34% from within a 90-mile radius. So far, he says, he is beating those targets. He also hopes to train 400 apprentices while procuring nearly 60% of the entire project from a UK supply chain. \u201cWe have had fantastic support from the Somerset chamber of commerce,\u201d he says. \u201cTo give one example, we have already seen a local food co-op, the Somerset Larder, set up in preparation for feeding what we estimate to be the 25,000 people who will move through the site over the lifetime of the scheme. But we want to make sure that all this is sustainable, with a wider group of customers beyond HPC [Hinkley Point C], so that that activity continues after the project is complete.\u201d Nevertheless, Cann faces a truckload of scepticism. The Department of Energy and Climate Change is reviewing whether the project can really be built on time, while leading energy analysts, such as Peter Atherton at Liberum Capital, believe the enormous cost and appalling track record in the nuclear industry of doing things on time mean ministers should scrap Hinkley. Flamanville was meant to be completed by 2012 and yet has just been put back till 2017. The blame for this has been put on Areva, which is also seven years behind with Olkiluoto 3. Costs for these projects have soared, and while EDF argues Hinkley will cost \u00a316bn, the European commission has already predicted the cost will be closer to \u00a325bn, with much of the cash coming as a subsidy regime ultimately paid for by consumers. And before the French company gives the go-ahead to the Somerset project, it also needs to finalise shareholdings in the plant.

      "body": "<p><strong> </strong></p> <p>Nigel Cann has a big job on. A director of EDF Energy, it is his job to deliver the biggest construction project in Europe: the Hinkley Point C nuclear plant, which is needed as soon as possible to help keep Britain\u2019s lights on, and is a project with vast commercial and political capital riding on it.</p> <p>Experience suggests that the construction of the first nuclear reactor constructed in Britain for quarter of a century \u2013 located on the Somerset coast \u2013 will not be straightforward. Similar projects in France and Finland have run into huge delays and cost overruns.</p> <p>This week EDF has put back the completion date of its newbuild project at Flamanville in Normandy while Areva, another Hinkley shareholder and the designer of the reactors, has admitted it may need a financial bailout.</p> <p>Fortunately, Cann is a confident kind of chap. He insists he is not overly daunted by Hinkley and its \u00a325bn price tag \u2013 the equivalent of putting on almost three London Olympics. \u201cI grew up around the Channel Tunnel rail project. Everyone admired those \u2018tunnel tigers\u2019, as they were known, and I want to create the same atmosphere around here.\u201d</p> <p>It is, he says, \u201can honour and a challenge to have this responsibility, but I also feel humble,\u201d adding: \u201cI do not underestimate the job. This is the biggest single foreign investment in this country since world war two.\u201d</p> <p>So what makes him think that EDF and its partner Areva can deliver a working power station in Britain by 2023 \u2013 something they have individually or collectively failed to do on time and on budget with similar European Pressurised Reactors (EPRs) at Flamanville and Olkiluoto in Finland? \u201cWe spend a lot of time reviewing these other projects and finding out what we can learn from them. We have workshops centred on what went wrong. I admit that some of what I have read is quite ugly.</p> <p>\u201cThere has been a lack of attention to detail in places, some miscommunications. We do a lot of scenario-based training on issues such as the quality of concrete, which was an issue at Olkiluoto. But all the parties are sharing their experiences with us and learning is in our DNA.\u201d</p> <p>EDF is also taking experience gained from the 2012 Olympics and Heathrow Terminal 5 \u2013 signing early agreements with trade unions, using \u201cmock-up\u201d sites to practise construction techniques as well as utilising prefabricated and modular parts.</p> <p>Cann is sitting in a glorified portable cabin that acts as a viewing gallery, his shirt sleeves rolled up as if ready to start digging himself. Outside, the rain spatters down on massive yellow earthmoving equipment lumbering around mountains of chocolate-coloured earth.</p> <p>The French company has around 400 people already at work clearing a 175-hectare site next door to Hinkley Point A and B, the first being decommissioned, the latter still operating. Cann\u2019s team is also putting in place roads and roundabouts including a bypass round the small village of Canning so that locals will be saved some of the inconvenience of the 750 trucks a day that will go in an out of the Hinkley site.</p> <p>EDF spent \u00a35m during September alone on Hinkley Point C, whose generous subsidy regime <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/oct/08/european-commission-approves-hinkley-point-nuclear-subsidy-deal\" title=\"\">has just been given the all-clear by Brussels,</a> but EDF has yet to make a final investment decision. This will almost certainly come early in the new year.</p> <p>Cann, who previously ran Hinkley Point B and before that another nuclear plant at Dungeness in his native Kent, admits the new job is different.</p> <p>\u201cPeople think there is not very much going on here yet. But it does not feel that way to me. It is different from going into an existing plant. There is very little structure to start with, and you have got to create it. It is very important to be focused on safety, quality and control. That is really easy to talk about but much harder to do.\u201d</p> <p>Only 60% of the Somerset project is nuclear \u2013 the remaining 40% is conventional work, such as building a sea wall and a jetty to bring in aggregates for construction, plus drilling tunnels for cooling pipelines going out to sea.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"21e5d6349394f057b65b174c989b56f0cd89b208\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/20/1416513565518/0f4264e5-632a-4d0e-86c5-c7580524f123-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"EDF's Nigel Cann\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018This is the biggest single foreign investment in this country since world war two,\u2019 says Nigel Cann.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adrian Sherratt for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One of the key issues for Cann, he says, is to make sure the local community \u2013 and Britain more widely \u2013 takes as much as it can out of the project, especially in the way of jobs and services.</p> <p>Critics often suggest that these kinds of colossal projects, especially those run by foreign firms, simply suck in skilled foreign workers at the expense of local, and even nuclear experts have repeatedly warned about British skill shortages.</p> <p>By the end of next year, he expects to have 2,000 workers on site, moving up to 5,600 at peak time, and Cann is aiming for 24% of recruits to come from Somerset and 34% from within a 90-mile radius. So far, he says, he is beating those targets. He also hopes to train 400 apprentices while procuring nearly 60% of the entire project from a UK supply chain.</p> <p>\u201cWe have had fantastic support from the Somerset chamber of commerce,\u201d he says. \u201cTo give one example, we have already seen a local food co-op, the Somerset Larder, set up in preparation for feeding what we estimate to be the 25,000 people who will move through the site over the lifetime of the scheme. But we want to make sure that all this is sustainable, with a wider group of customers beyond HPC [Hinkley Point C], so that that activity continues after the project is complete.\u201d</p> <p>Nevertheless, Cann faces a truckload of scepticism. The Department of Energy and Climate Change is reviewing whether the project can really be built on time, while leading energy analysts, such as Peter Atherton at Liberum Capital, believe the enormous cost and appalling track record in the nuclear industry of doing things on time mean ministers should scrap Hinkley. Flamanville was meant to be completed by 2012 and yet has just been put back till 2017.</p> <p>The blame for this has been put on Areva, which is also seven years behind with Olkiluoto 3. Costs for these projects have soared, and while EDF argues Hinkley will cost \u00a316bn, the European commission has already predicted the cost will be closer to \u00a325bn, with much of the cash coming as a subsidy regime ultimately paid for by consumers.</p> <p>And before the French company gives the go-ahead to the Somerset project, it also needs to finalise shareholdings in the plant. Talks are going on with a variety of potential investors, including Saudi Arabia\u2019s electricity group, as the future of Areva remains in question.</p> <p>Cann is also aware that his project will compete for skilled British labour at a time when other huge schemes are under way, such as the Thames Tideway and Crossrail tunnels in London and the HS2 rail line, not to mention other nuclear plants planned by Gloucester-based rival Horizon, owned by Hitachi.</p> <p>\u201cIt would be naive and arrogant if we thought this was the only place in town [to work],\u201d says Cann. \u201cBut I want people to enjoy working here safely and for them \u2013 as for me \u2013 we will get a buzz out of building a huge bit of infrastructure that will be here for 100 years.

The closing scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished 17.70 points or 0.26% lower at 6678.90 Germany\u2019s Dax added 0.12% to 9483.97 France\u2019s Cac closed down 0.75% at 4234.21 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 0.88% to 19,209.22 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 1.62% lower at 10,209.2 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 10 points or 0.06% higher. A week ago, we were wondering whether Germany was in recession. Last Friday\u2019s growth figures showed it wasn\u2019t (hurrah!) but the relief has now worn off.. More disappointing news for Eurozone growth hopes -- consumer confidence has fallen to a nine-month low. The European Commission\u2019s monthly survey of consumer morale weakened to -11.6 this month, from -11.1 in October. Here\u2019s some stronger US economic data \u2013 the Philadelphia Federal Reserve\u2019s survey of manufacturing in its region has surged to its highest level in over 20 years. The Philly Fed index showed that new orders doubled month-on-month, and the employment measure also jumped. Confirmation that today\u2019s US PMI report suggests economic growth will ease up as 2014 grinds to a close. Growth in America\u2019s factory sector is also slowing this month, as export growth drops. That\u2019s according to Markit\u2019s monthly PMI survey, just released. The flash US manufacturing PMI dipped to a ten-month low of 54.7, down from 55.9 in October. That means the sector is growing at the slowest pace since January. On the upside, it does still shows growth, so America is outpacing Germany, France or China (details here) But still, it\u2019s another sign that the global economy is cooling this month. Over in New York, shares have dipped in early trading after the latest PMI surveys from Europe and China showed growth slowing. This morning\u2019s disappointingly weak eurozone PMI surveys show that the European economy is in rather worse shape than three years ago when the debt crisis began. So reckons bond expert Nick Spiro, of Spiro Sovereign Strategy, anyway. Here\u2019s his take: True to form, France\u2019s private sector continued to contract in November, with manufacturing output performing even worse than expected and at its lowest level since August. Last week\u2019s better-than-expected third quarter GDP print - which in any case was flattered by yet more government spending - is already a distant memory. France continues to flirt with recession, boding ill for the fiscal and structural reforms it\u2019s seeking to implement and playing into the hands of the National Front\u2019s Marine Le Pen. As if France\u2019s November PMI wasn\u2019t bad enough, German private sector output was particularly weak, with manufacturing activity - suffering from the sharpest decline in new orders in almost two years - narrowly avoiding an outright contraction. The services sector, moreover, which performed relatively well in October, is now slowing significantly. The two grim surveys speak volumes about the breadth and depth of the economic downturn in the eurozone which has spread deep into the core of the bloc. The eurozone economy is now in significantly worse shape than at the time of the severe escalation of the financial crisis in 2011. We also have new US jobs data. And the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefit fell by 2,000 last week, to 291,000. Economists had expected a bigger fall, to 285,000, but on the upside it\u2019s the 10th week running that initial claims has been &lt;300k. The number of \u2018continuing claims\u2019 also fell, to 2.33m -- the lowest level since December 2000. Just in -- US inflation was unchanged last month, with consumer prices unchanged compared with September. On an annual basis, the Consumer Prices Index rose by 1.7% in October, for the third month running. But there are signs that inflation pressures are building. Core inflation, which strips out food and energy, rose by 0.2% during the month, pushing the annual rate up to 1.8%. Over in Greece, finance minister Gikas Hardouvelis will shortly hold a teleconference with troika representatives. It is a bid to break the impasse in negotiations between the two. From Athens, my colleague Helena Smith reports: Officials are saying the teleconference will take place this afternoon, barely a day after prime minister Antonis Samaras\u2019 government sent the troika an email outlining the measures it plans to take to successfully exit its bailout programme. The proposals will be the focus of the talks, well-briefed sources say. The sticking point appears to be how Greece will plug a fiscal gap that the troika reckons will be no less than \u20ac3.6bn. This has led to negotiations between the two sides all but breaking down this week. Helena explains: Hardouvelis, an economics professor, believes the gap will be much smaller and is sticking by his guns arguing that prognostications of a larger-than-expected fiscal gap this year also failed to materialize. Auditors representing the EU, IMF and ECB have been examining the proposals with officials saying that today\u2019s teleconference will determine when mission chiefs return to Athens to complete their last review of the Greek economy. Much hangs on that decision. Discussions over a precautionary credit line \u2013 seen as the first step to Greece effectively exiting its bailout programme \u2013 can only begin once the review is completed successfully. Racheting up the pressure on the government, pensioners took to the streets today, demanding that they be compensated for all the cuts they have had to suffer as the price of international aid to keep the Greek economy afloat. And here are some photos of those protesting pensioners: Warwick Business School\u2019s professor of financial economics, John Thanassoulis, has suggested a way to end the clash between the UK and Brussels over bankers\u2019 pay. He reckons the UK should accept the principal of a bonus cap but lobby to have the cap reinterpreted as a bonus pool cap, based on a bank\u2019s appropriately weighted assets. That would improve financial stability, not damage it, he says, and reduce pay in the sector. \u201cIf the bonus cap becomes a bonus pool cap it has the main effect of stopping banks over-stretching their balance sheet to bid for bankers at ever more inflated levels. This hobbles poaching banks, so taking the steam out of the market for bankers and so lowering pay levels. The well run banks can then hire the bankers they would have done in any case, but more cheaply. This lowers the banks\u2019 cost base and enhances their stability. \u201cThis proposal is research based and is founded on peer-reviewed articles published in scholarly journals. Chemicals and oil producer Ineos is announcing plans to spend \u00a3640m searching for commercially viable shale gas sites in Scotland and Northern England. Ineos says it will \u201clead\u201d the shale revolution in the UK, and is promising to share the proceeds with local residents. Environmental firms are concerned, though: Chemicals giant Ineos to announce \u00a3640m UK fracking investment The opposition Labour party reckons the government was wrong to take the bank bonus tax row to the European Court of Justice. Cathy Jamieson MP, Labour\u2019s Shadow Financial Secretary to the Treasury, says: \u201cWhile working people face a cost-of-living crisis and lending to business is falling it\u2019s astonishing that George Osborne\u2019s priority has been to spend taxpayers\u2019 money fighting a cap on bankers\u2019 bonuses. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t have taken the EU to act to rein in excessive bonuses, but there has simply been no action from the Chancellor here in Britain. \u201cWe will repeat Labour\u2019s tax on bank bonuses and use the money to fund a paid starter job for every young person out of work for over a year.\u201d The Open Europe thinktank reckons that the ECJ advocate general has overlooked some important issues, as he swept aside the UK\u2019s opposition to the bank bonus rules.... ...including the impact of the caps on financial stability (ie, what happens if bankers are simply paid more?) One of the UK\u2019s main arguments is that this law will result in higher fixed pay which makes remuneration less flexible and raises fixed costs for banks, thereby undermining any attempt to improve financial stability. This issue is not addressed at all in the opinion. Furthermore, while the opinion addresses the issues of remuneration impacting risk and the fact that fixed pay can still vary it does not look at how the two can interact. It is clear that as a result of this fixed pay will increase substantially but there is no question of how this impacts stability. This may be more an economic/financial point but given the issues are discussed separately their interaction should also be examined. The Treasury has now issued a harder-hitting response over this morning\u2019s bank bonus cap \u2018ruling\u2019. They argue that the European Court of Justice\u2019s Advocate General has shown why the cap is a bad idea: The detail of the opinion also demolishes the case for the fixed ratio by pointing out that it doesn\u2019t equate to a cap on bankers pay because there is no limit on basic salaries. This is precisely the reason why we, the PRA [Prudential Regulatory Authority] and the Bank of England have been opposed to this policy.\u201d That doesn\u2019t change the fact that the ECJ is now very likely to reject the UK\u2019s case next year. The weak eurozone PMIs have hit shares across Europe. The FTSE 100 and German DAX are both down 0.7% , while the French CAC has shed 1.2%. Mining shares are leading the fallers in London, as traders calculate that weaker economic growth in Europe and China will dent demand for commodities. My colleague Nick Fletcher explains: Last night\u2019s US Federal Reserve minutes are providing little impetus, and a weak French purchasing managers report and data from China showing growth in the country\u2019s manufacturing sector had stalled this month are also pushing shares down. So with metal prices weak, Rio Tinto is down 70.5p at 2871.5p, Anglo American has lost 32p to 1290.5p and BHP Billiton has fallen 36.5p to 1588.5p. Nick\u2019s early market report has full details: FTSE falls as miners hit by weak Chinese data but Johnson Matthey shines The gloom over the global economy has darkened, with the news that the eurozone\u2019s private sector is suffered its weakest growth in 16 months. The latest deterioration in France\u2019s private sector this month (see 8.20am), and the surprise stagnation at Germany\u2019s factories (see 8.43am) has dragged back growth across the region. With Chinese factory growth falling to a six-month low, concerns over world growth look increasingly valid. Markit\u2019s headline Eurozone PMI, which measures business activity in the manufacturing and services economies, fell from 52.1 in October to 51.4, its lowest since July 2013. Firms across the single currency reported that new orders fell this month, and employment levels were flat with companies unwilling to hire. Selling prices fell, showing the eurozone continues to suffer from deflationary pressures. France is a \u201ca key area of weakness\u201d, Markit says, with business activity falling for a seventh consecutive month and job cuts continuing. Germany\u2019s slowdown, is also a worry, with business activity growing at the weakest rate since July 2013 amid a stagnation of new orders. And growth in the rest of the eurozone has \u201cslowed marginally\u201d this month.\uf0a7 Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, fears the eurozone could slip into a \u2018renewed downturn\u2019 \u201cThe single currency area is struggling to eke out any growth, with the PMI indicating that GDP is likely to have risen by just 0.1-0.2% in the fourth quarter. A drop in new orders for the first time in almost one-and-a-half years, albeit only very marginal, suggests growth could slow further in December. And this means the European Central Bank could face fresh calls for more action (even though it argues repeatedly that monetary policy can\u2019t solve Europe\u2019s problems): \u201cPolicymakers will no doubt be disappointed that recent announcements and stimulus measures are showing no signs of reviving growth. The deteriorating trend in the surveys will add to pressure for the ECB to do more to boost the economy without waiting to gauge the effectiveness of previously-announced initiatives.\u201d Lawyer Alexandria Carr of Mayer Brown (who we quoted earlier), also reckons the ECJ\u2019s Advocate General has ignored part of the UK\u2019s case against bonus caps: \u201cThe Advocate General argues that the legislation does not impose a \u201ccap\u201d or limit on pay because banks are free to raise basic pay which would permit the amount of the bonus to be increased also, as the legislation fixes the level of bonuses by reference to basic pay. This ignores the UK\u2019s main concern: that the legislation actually breaks the link between compensation and performance by driving banks to increase basic pay which, unlike bonuses, cannot be clawed back in the event of performance issues relating to the bank or individual. The UK concern is that, rather than enhance the stability of the financial system, this legislation is in danger of undermining it. It is not clear, from the press release at least, that this Opinion has paid any heed to this legitimate and fundamental concern.\u201d Back to the European Court of Justice advisor\u2019s ruling against UK over the bankers bonus cap. Tom Gosling, head of PwC\u2019s reward practice, reckons the ECJ will take the same view, in its final decision next year: It seems unlikely now that the Court will overturn the Advocate General\u2019s Opinion, so banks should continue planning on the basis that the bonus cap will still be in force next year. It\u2019s probably cold comfort for many, but at least one of the many sources of regulatory uncertainties for banks\u2019 pay seems to have been removed. \u201cThe bonus cap alone is too blunt an instrument to curb risk taking in the banking industry and brings with it many unintended consequences, particularly an increase in fixed pay and a reduction in the level of bonuses available for clawback in the event of future prudential or conduct issues. Bonus levels in the industry needed to, and have been, coming down, but in our view other remuneration reforms are more effective at curbing risk. \u201cIt\u2019s unlikely that the bonus cap itself causes existing business to up sticks and move away from London. However, it does make London somewhat less attractive as a place to build new capability, and so the impact is likely to be felt over a number of years rather than immediately. Jean-Francois Gerard, a lawyer from Freshfields, reckons Brussels will take a closer look at the \u2018allowances\u2019 which some banks have introduced to get around the cap. \u201cEBA and the EU Commission have already said they don\u2019t like \u201cfixed\u201d or \u201crole based\u201d allowances, which some banks introduced, so the debate is likely to now move from arguing about the validity of the cap to arguing about the validity of new practices such as these allowances.\u201d Paul Randall, head of incentives partner at international law firm Ashurst, reckons bankers\u2019 fixed pay will now come under scrutiny (as Mark Carney suggested this week) \u201cAs expected, it looks like the bonus cap is here to stay and that could lead to further regulation if basic, non-performance related, salaries rise as a result. The Governor of the Bank of England has suggested this week that fixed pay may itself need to be subject to clawback, leaving the whole pay package exposed.\u201d And Ashurst regulatory partner Rob Moulton suggests Britain could be chastened by the defeat: \u201cWhile this is not necessarily the end of the UK\u2019s challenge, it doesn\u2019t give the UK much hope of success when the Court hands down its decision early next year. Some may even say it\u2019s a clear indication of the likely winner in the power struggle between the EU and the UK. \u201cThe Advocate-General\u2019s view may signal the end of the UK\u2019s campaign of organised disobedience against the EU\u2019s rules on pay in banks.\u201d UK retail sales rose faster than expected last month, thanks to an increase in demand for furniture and generally lower prices, according to data just released. The ONS reports that retail sales volumes jumped by 0.8% month-on-month, after shrinking 0.4% in September. Clothing sales remained weak, as people continued to resist buying new winter clothes as the autumn was so mild. The figures also show that prices fell by 1.5% year-on-year, as firms slash prices. That\u2019s the biggest decline since 2002! Rachel Farr, employment lawyer at Taylor Wessing LLP, also believes the European Court of Justice will side with Advocate General J\u00e4\u00e4skinen and uphold bankers bonus caps. Alexandria Carr, regulatory lawyer at international law firm Mayer Brown, reckons the UK\u2019s attempt to fight EU bonus caps looks doomed, now that the European Court of Justice\u2019s advisor has recommended rejecting Britain\u2019s pleas. She says: \u201cThe Opinion of the Advocate General is not unanticipated and is in line with the general direction of travel of EU financial services regulation post financial crisis which has seen increased EU intervention in matters which were previously regarded as matters best left to the discretion of each individual country. Although this Opinion is not binding, and the Court chose not to follow this very Advocate General\u2019s Opinion in respect of the UK\u2019s challenge to the short selling regulation, it would be surprising if the Court chose to depart from the Opinion in this case.\u201d The UK Treasury has issued a brief statement: \u201cThe government notes the Advocate General of the European Court of Justice\u2019s Opinion on our legal challenge against the EU \u2018bonus cap\u2019. We are considering the Opinion and its implications in detail.\u201d The Advocate General at the European Court of Justice has concluded that European legislation limiting bankers\u2019 bonuses is valid, in a blow to the UK government. Britain had asked the ECJ to strike down EU rules which limit a bankers\u2019 bonus to 100% of their base salary, or 200% with shareholder approval. But Advocate General Niilo J\u00e4\u00e4skinen \u2013 advisor to the Court \u2013 has considered the matter, and recommended that the UK\u2019s pleas should be dismissed. That\u2019s a recommendation rather than the final verdict from the ECJ, but it does suggest that the UK will not win this fight. The UK had argued that the EU could not impose caps on bankers bonuses because this was an issue of \u201csocial policy\u201d and as such within the competence of the Member States. The ECJ explains: The UK also argued that the provisions infringe the principles of proportionality and subsidiarity, that the directive violates the principle of legal certainty, that the conferral of powers to the EBA is illegal, and that the regulation\u2019s measures requiring disclosure of remuneration infringes the right to privacy and data protection rules. But: In his Opinion today, Advocate General Niilo Ja\u0308a\u0308skinen suggests that all the UK\u2019s pleas should be rejected and that the Court of Justice dismiss the action. Ja\u0308a\u0308skinen concluded that: ..fixing the ratio of variable remuneration to basic salaries does not equate to a \u201ccap on bankers bonuses\u201d, or fixing the level of pay, because there is no limit imposed on the basic salaries that the bonuses are pegged against. (true, but opponents of the cap point out that basic salaries, unlike bonuses, cannot be clawed back easily, so it won\u2019t help fight bad behaviour in the City. And he also rejected the claim that the plan \u201cinfringes the principles of proportionality and subsidiarity\u201d. Basically, he didn\u2019t agree that national governments could create a uniform regulatory framework of risk management better than the EU. So, a disappointment for the UK. But not an unexpected one, really. Crumbs. Germany private sector growth has fallen to a 16-month low, as its factory sector stalls. Markit reports that the flash German manufacturing PMI dropped to exactly 50 this month, showing the sector stagnated, as firms report a drop in new orders. And growth in the service sector slowed too, with the flash PMI dropping to 52.1, from 54.4. Firms reported that there was no increase in new business this month, while new work fell at the steepest rate in nearly two years. This was blamed on economic uncertainty and weaker demand from both domestic and foreign markets. Oliver Kolodseike, economist at Markit, reckons the data suggests the German economy may not achieve any meaningful growth in the fourth quarter of 2014, having grown by just 0.1% in July-September. \u201cPrivate sector output growth in Germany slowed to a 16-month low in November. Moreover, it seems Germany\u2019s service sector has started to lose momentum, with activity growth in the sector the weakest since July last year, while manufacturing growth remained sluggish. Companies reported that economic uncertainty and lower demand from both domestic and foreign markets hampered stronger growth in Germany\u2019s private sector. \u201cThe combination of weak output growth, ongoing spare capacity and a lack of new order wins (despite a further reduction in charges) paints a worrying picture of the underlying health of the German economy.\u201d France\u2019s private sector has shrunk for the seventh successive month, with factories reporting another sharp fall in output in November. That\u2019s according to Markit\u2019s latest PMI surveys, which show that activity across the private sector is still falling. Here are the key points: Flash France Composite Output Index rises to 48.4 (48.2 in October), 2-month high Flash France Services Activity Index climbs to 48.8 (48.3 in October), 3-month high Flash France Manufacturing Output Index falls to 46.5 (48.0 in October), 3-month low Flash France Manufacturing PMI drops to 47.6 (48.5 in October), 3-month low Reminder, any reading below 50 shows a contraction. French companies reported a drop in new business and new export orders, and another fall in employment (although jobs were shed at the slowest rate in a year). It suggests that the French economy, which grew by 0.3% last quarter, continues to struggle. Jack Kennedy, senior economist at Markit warns that private firms aren\u2019t contributing to growth in France: \u201cNovember\u2019s Flash PMI data point to another weak performance by France\u2019s private sector economy, with output showing a further modest fall. Increased government spending helped support a 0.3% rise in third quarter GDP, but the continued softness in private sector activity signalled by the PMIs suggests an ongoing drag on growth during the fourth quarter from this area of the economy. Another round of job shedding by companies during November meanwhile provides little hope of bringing down the high unemployment rate.\u201d In the UK, Royal Bank of Scotland has been fined a total of \u00a356m over a meltdown in its consumer systems in 2012, that locked 6.5 million customers out of their bank accounts for several days. The 81% taxpayer owned bank issued an apology for the problems and said it had docked the bonuses of staff responsible for collapse of the IT systems which affected customers at RBS, NatWest and Ulster Bank . The FCA, which imposed a \u00a342m penalty (the rest comes from the PRA) says banks must improve their computer systems. But it\u2019s remembering that even the Bank of England isn\u2019t immune to IT failure. Last month the BoE\u2019s CHAPS system the handles large money transfers in the UK failed for most of the day, delaying many house purchases. The disappointing Chinese data will hit sentiment in the City, says Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets. He writes that the PMI report: ...adds to signs that more stimulus is needed to offset slowing growth in the world\u2019s number 2 economy. There is talk of China boosting banks\u2019 lending power to help spur growth, with more flexible loan-to-deposit ratios (short term boost, longer term danger?). The drop in the Chinese factory PMI shows \u201cjust how choppy China\u2019s economy is at the moment\u201d, says Stan Shamu of IG. This chart from Reuters shows how the pace of growth in China\u2019s factory sector has been slowing, pretty much, for the last few years Japanese factory activity grew at a slightly slower rate in November as new order growth dipped, in another sign that demand eased this month. Japan\u2019s manufacturing PMI fell to 52.1 in November from 52.4 in October, signalling a slight slowdown (but still in expansion territory over 50) But production output did jump at the fastest rate since March, suggesting the country\u2019s recession could be short-lived. Growth in China\u2019s factory sector has stalled this month, in the latest signal that the global economy is slowing. HSBC\u2019s survey of Chinese firms, released this morning, shows that activity across the sector was flat in November. And output is actually contracting, for the first time in six months. HSBC reports that the \u2018flash China Manufacturing PMI\u2019 came in at exactly 50, the tipping point between growth and expansion. That\u2019s a six-month low. Output fell into contraction territory, hitting a seven-month low of 49.5. Growth in new exports slowed, while employment at Chinese factories decreased at a faster rate than in October. Hongbin Qu, HSBC\u2019s chief economist for China, says the report shows that Beijing needs to do stimulate growth: Disinflationary pressures remain strong and the labour market showed further signs of weakening. Weak price pressures and low capacity utilization point to insufficient demand in the economy. Furthermore, we still see uncertainties in the months ahead from the property market and on the export front. We think growth still faces significant downward pressures, and more monetary and fiscal easing measures should be deployed.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial market, the eurozone and business. Coming up this morning... \u2018flash\u2019 estimates of how the eurozone\u2019s two largest economies, Germany and France, are performing this month. Data provider Markit is expected to report that activity in France\u2019s private sector is shrinking again this month, while German service firms and manufacturers continue to grow. Regular readers will already know that Markit\u2019s PMI reports are based on interviews with purchasing managers at a range of companies. They explains how output, employment, new orders and suchlike has changed this month, and Markit come up with a number -- where anything over 50 shows growth. Economists expect French manufacturing to come in at 48.8 (up from 48.5) and services PMI at 48.5 (up from 48.3), at 8am GMT. German manufacturing is tipped to inch up to 51.5 (up from 51.4) and 54.5 (up from 54.4), at 8.30am, A weak performance will add to concerns that Europe is teetering on recession, after growing by just 0.2% in the last quarter. We also get the latest US inflation data and weekly jobless report, (1.30pm GMT) and eurozone consumer confidence at 3pm. In the eurozone, we\u2019ll be watching Greece as it struggles to get a deal with its lenders. The latest word from Athens is that it will table the final draft of its 2015 budget in Parliament on Friday without having secured the approval of the country\u2019s creditors.

Here\u2019s his take:<br></p> <ol> <li>True to form, France\u2019s private sector continued to contract in November, with manufacturing output performing even worse than expected and at its lowest level since August. Last week\u2019s better-than-expected third quarter GDP print - which in any case was flattered by yet more government spending - is already a distant memory. France continues to flirt with recession, boding ill for the fiscal and structural reforms it\u2019s seeking to implement and playing into the hands of the National Front\u2019s Marine Le Pen.<br></li> <li>As if France\u2019s November PMI wasn\u2019t bad enough, German private sector output was particularly weak, with manufacturing activity - suffering from the sharpest decline in new orders in almost two years - narrowly avoiding an outright contraction. The services sector, moreover, which performed relatively well in October, is now slowing significantly.<br></li> <li>The two grim surveys speak volumes about the breadth and depth of the economic downturn in the eurozone which has spread deep into the core of the bloc. The eurozone economy is now in significantly worse shape than at the time of the severe escalation of the financial crisis in 2011.<br></li> </ol>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ianbremmer/statuses/535431893953822720\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Europe GDP still hasn&#39;t recovered to pre-crisis levels. <a href=\"http://t.co/xjld4BEoDd\">pic.twitter.com/xjld4BEoDd</a></p>&mdash; ian bremmer (@ianbremmer) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ianbremmer/status/535431893953822720\">November 20, 2014</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2014-11-20T14:28:53.898Z\">at 2.28pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-546dee96e4b0770f491f72ee\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-11-20T13:41:27.823Z\">1.41pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>We also have new US jobs data</strong>.

Bonus levels in the industry needed to, and have been, coming down, but in our view other remuneration reforms are more effective at curbing risk.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s unlikely that the bonus cap itself causes existing business to up sticks and move away from London.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Chris Ronnie, the former boss of JJB Sports, has been found guilty of accepting more than \u00a31m in backhanders from suppliers. The 52-year-old faces up to 10 years in jail after he was convicted of taking three cash payments from suppliers to the retail chain \u2013 which was once Britain\u2019s biggest sportswear retailer but collapsed into administration in 2012. Some of the cash was used to buy property in Florida. Ronnie was found guilty on three counts of fraud and two of furnishing false information after proceedings that lasted more than two months. He refused to give evidence in the trial, which followed an investigation by the Serious Fraud Office. In comments that appeared to suggest Ronnie would be sent to jail, Judge Nicholas Loraine-Smith said: \u201cI\u2019m granting you bail to give you an opportunity to get your affairs in order.\u201d Prosecutors will now also seek to bar Ronnie from acting as a company director. The fraud came to light after JJB executives called in the Office of Fair Trading in 2009 \u2013 in exchange for immunity \u2013 to investigate the possibility that the chain had fixed prices on football shirts with rival Sports Direct, the sportswear firm run by the Newcastle United owner Mike Ashley, when Ronnie was at the helm. Ronnie spent only 18 months as chief executive of JJB, during which time its share price collapsed from more than \u00a32 to less than 3p, feeding suspicions that he was undermining the business to benefit Sports Direct, where he had previously worked. Ashley was never implicated in any wrongdoing. The OFT asked for the SFO\u2019s assistance in its investigation and it later emerged that the inquiry had widened to suspected fraud. At the time the fraud was committed, in 2007 and 2008, Ronnie owed an Icelandic bank more than \u00a311m. He had borrowed it to acquire a 29% stake in JJB in 2007 alongside another investor. He then took charge of the company. Ronnie was sacked as chief executive in early 2009 after it emerged he had lost control of his stake in JJB during the Icelandic banking crisis but had not notified the company. At Southwark crown court on Thursday, Ronnie was found to have worked with David Ball, owner of the JJB supplier Fashion &amp; Sport, and with David Barrington, who with Ball was involved in a sports goods supplier called Performance Brands, to create false loan deals. Jurors heard that Ronnie\u2019s company Seacroft received a payment of \u00a3650,000 in February 2008 from Performance Brands and then $380,000 (about \u00a3197,000) from Fashion &amp; Sport in June of that year. A third payment, again from Fashion and Sport, was made to Ronnie later that year, this time of $250,000 (about \u00a3134,000). When Ronnie was interviewed by the SFO, he claimed that the payments were loans for him and his wife, Helen, to buy \u201ca very nice property\u201d in Florida. The court found that the loans were in fact private payments to Ronnie made without the knowledge of JJB\u2019s board of directors. Evidence of the loans emerged in emails to Ball and Barrington. They were both found guilty of perverting the course of justice. After the SFO knocked at their door, they asked a computer engineer to wipe any trace of emails crucial to the investigation and ordered a misleading report. But the engineer kept a copy of all the emails and later handed them to the SFO, giving it explosive evidence of how the two men had tried to cover their tracks. The jury cleared Ball of two counts of supplying false information and were discharged from considering a further count of the same charge after failing to reach a verdict. Miranda Moore, acting for the prosecution, said Ronnie had failed to disclose to JJB\u2019s board of directors that he had a financial interest in the deals. \u201cOn none of the three occasions did he go to his board of directors and say: \u2018Gentlemen, I know we are doing business with this company but you should know I have received this money and this money and this money\u2019. \u201cMr Ronnie had a number of opportunities to say: \u2018Look, I\u2019m going to do this\u2019 and tell them all about it. He never took that opportunity because he wanted to keep the money for himself,\u201d Moore said. All three men will be sentenced on 12 December.",

      "body": "<p>Chris Ronnie, the former boss of JJB Sports, has been found guilty of accepting more than \u00a31m in backhanders from suppliers.</p> <p>The 52-year-old faces up to 10 years in jail after he was convicted of taking three cash payments from suppliers to the retail chain \u2013 which was once Britain\u2019s biggest sportswear retailer but collapsed into administration in 2012. Some of the cash was used to buy property in Florida.</p> <p>Ronnie was found guilty on three counts of fraud and two of furnishing false information after proceedings that lasted more than two months. He refused to give evidence in the trial, which followed an investigation by the Serious Fraud Office.</p> <p>In comments that appeared to suggest Ronnie would be sent to jail, Judge Nicholas Loraine-Smith said: \u201cI\u2019m granting you bail to give you an opportunity to get your affairs in order.\u201d</p> <p>Prosecutors will now also seek to bar Ronnie from acting as a company director.</p> <p>The fraud came to light after JJB executives called in the Office of Fair Trading in 2009 \u2013 in exchange for immunity \u2013 to investigate the possibility that the chain had fixed prices on football shirts with rival Sports Direct, the sportswear firm run by the Newcastle United owner Mike Ashley, when Ronnie was at the helm.</p> <p>Ronnie spent only 18 months as chief executive of JJB, during which time its share price collapsed from more than \u00a32 to less than 3p, feeding suspicions that he was undermining the business to benefit Sports Direct, where he had previously worked. Ashley was never implicated in any wrongdoing.</p> <p>The OFT asked for the SFO\u2019s assistance in its investigation and it later emerged that the inquiry had widened to suspected fraud. At the time the fraud was committed, in 2007 and 2008, Ronnie owed an Icelandic bank more than \u00a311m. He had borrowed it to acquire a 29% stake in JJB in 2007 alongside another investor. He then took charge of the company.</p> <p>Ronnie was sacked as chief executive in early 2009 after it emerged he had lost control of his stake in JJB during the Icelandic banking crisis but had not notified the company.</p> <p>At Southwark crown court on Thursday, Ronnie was found to have worked with David Ball, owner of the JJB supplier Fashion &amp; Sport, and with David Barrington, who with Ball was involved in a sports goods supplier called Performance Brands, to create false loan deals.</p> <p>Jurors heard that Ronnie\u2019s company Seacroft received a payment of \u00a3650,000 in February 2008 from Performance Brands and then $380,000 (about \u00a3197,000) from Fashion &amp; Sport in June of that year. A third payment, again from Fashion and Sport, was made to Ronnie later that year, this time of $250,000 (about \u00a3134,000).</p> <p>When Ronnie was interviewed by the SFO, he claimed that the payments were loans for him and his wife, Helen, to buy \u201ca very nice property\u201d in Florida.

The onus is likely to remain on the dominant services sector to keep the overall economic recovery chugging along.\u201d R&amp;D spending still rising A separate report from the Office for National Statistics showed spending on research and development (R&amp;D) within UK businesses was \u00a318.4bn in 2013, 8% higher than 2012. More than half of the amount, 54%, was spent by foreign-owned businesses in the UK. The number of people employed in R&amp;D roles by UK businesses increased by 11% to 178,000 on a full-time equivalents basis, which was the largest annual increase since 1985. EEF, the manufacturing trade body, said business spending on R&amp;D had now returned to pre-crisis levels. \u201cManufacturers have continued to prioritise investment in innovation over a challenging few years, but though we\u2019re back to where we were, we\u2019re not yet where we want to be. R&amp;D expenditure remains low compared with international levels,\u201d said Lee Hopley, EEF\u2019s chief economist. Business spending on R&amp;D was 1.1% of gross domestic product in 2013, lower than the 1.6% average for member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development according to EEF. Civil R&amp;D spending in the UK increased by 8% in 2013 to \u00a316.7bn, while defence R&amp;D spending increased by 7% to \u00a31.7bn. Pharmaceutical companies spent the most on R&amp;D in 2013, at \u00a34.1bn, followed by the car industry at \u00a32.1bn and computer programming companies at \u00a32bn.",

      "bodyText": "Rolls-Royce could be in line for a boost from Delta Airlines. Reports suggest that Airbus has beaten Boeing to supply aircraft for Delta, a deal which could mean a $3bn deal for the UK aero-engine supplier. Airbus supposed won out because it could deliver the order more quickly than its rival. Analysts at Liberum said: According to trade press reports, Airbus has won the hotly-contested competition (with Boeing) for 50 wide-body aircraft to Delta. Sources say Airbus will sell Delta 25 A350-900s and 25 A330-900s. Rolls-Royce is the sole-source engine supplier.

As Lenore Taylor <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2014/nov/17/china-drops-barriers-on-australian-dairy-wine-and-beef-in-free-trade-deal\">noted in her report</a>, the $18bn figure is based on <a href=\"http://www.dfat.gov.au/fta/acfta/feasibility_full.pdf\">a feasibility study done in 2005</a> and is concerned with a theoretical agreement rather than the one agreed to this week.</p> <p>But no matter, the figure gets reported as fact, such as when the Australian <a href=\"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/in-depth/freetrade-deal-done-deal-as-tony-abbott-xi-jinping-conclude-talks/story-fnpebfcn-1227125600925\">opens its article</a> with the line that the agreement \u201cwill deliver at least at least $18bn over a decade\u201d.</p> <p>It also gets reported in odd ways. For example the <a href=\"http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/australia-signs-18-billion-free-trade-agreement-with-china-in-historic-deal/story-fni0fiyv-1227126347398\">Herald Sun reported</a> that \u201cit will drive at least $18bn in extra revenue into Australia\u2019s economy in the next decade and open a new era in economic cooperation\u201d.</p> <p>But what exactly is this \u201crevenue\u201d? </p> <p>The 2005 report did not suggest $18bn extra in export revenue \u2013 it suggested the extra growth from a China-Australia free trade agreement could \u201cboost Australia\u2019s and China\u2019s real GDP in the order of US$18bn\u201d. </p> <p>It\u2019s odd as well that the $18bn amount is never reported as being in US dollars, let alone 2005 US dollars when US$1 was A$0.75 rather than the A$0.87 it is now. The modelling actually put the benefits at A$24.4bn. </p> <p>But what does this mean? Firstly, it is over a 10-year period (from 2005-15 in the case of the modelling) and it is the \u201cnet present value\u201d \u2013 US$18bn (or A$24.4bn) in 2005 dollars. </p> <p>It is important to note that this does not mean they thought Australia\u2019s GDP would be $18bn larger by 2015. It means that over 10 years there would be a cumulative addition of $18bn of extra growth in 2005 money terms. </p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.dfat.gov.au/fta/acfta/modelling_benefits.pdf\">modelling</a>, which was used in the feasibility study, estimates that had a free-trade agreement been signed in 2005 by 2015, our GDP would have been about $3bn more than it would have otherwise been. </p> <p>Is that much? Well it\u2019s about 0.37% bigger. So no. It\u2019s not much at all.</p> <p>The feasibility study \u2013 in the very sentence that the US$18bn figure is mentioned \u2013 states \u201cthe annual average real GDP growth rate for both countries could increase by around 0.04% over the period 2005-15\u201d.</p> <p>Yep, 0.04% a year. Or, as the economist Tom Westland rather archly <a href=\"http://thomaswestland.wordpress.com/2014/11/17/how-to-read-media-analysis-of-the-china-australia-free-trade-agreement/\">describes it</a>, \u201ca rounding error\u201d.</p> <p>And bear in mind that growth figure is based on a deal that includes sugar and rice and involves immediate dropping of tariffs \u2013 something that is not in the present agreement. </p> <p>But never fear, the reporting of the game-changing boom will go forth spouting the $18bn figure. </p> <p>You might think the government would have thought to update the modelling, given our level of trade with China has changed rather drastically since 2005:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"graph 1\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/1zMj9/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>But no, they haven\u2019t. </p> <p>Despite the negotiations going on for 10 years, the trade minister, Andrew Robb, <a href=\"http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/2014/11/17/no-dollar-figure-china-free-trade-agreement-big\">told reporters</a> there was \u201cno time\u201d to do new modelling because the deal was being done at \u201cfive minutes to midnight\u201d. </p> <p>What this means is Robb and Abbott were more concerned about signing the deal on Monday so they could have a nice news story while the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, was in town, rather than wait till they had some idea whether the deal they were working towards was any good. </p> <p>The ludicrousness of citing the 2005 modelling is further highlighted by noting it estimates the 10-year benefit to <a href=\"http://econproph.com/2010/11/26/gdp-vs-gnp/\">GNP</a> (which counts production by Australians regardless of where they are, rather than GDP which counts only production in Australia) was US$22bn.
