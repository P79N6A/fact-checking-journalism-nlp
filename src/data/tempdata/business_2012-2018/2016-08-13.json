      "bodyText": "In a side street in the heart of Athens, two siblings are hard at work. For the past year they have run their hairdressing business \u2013 an enterprise that was once located on a busy boulevard \u2013 out of a two-bedroom flat. The move was purely financial: last summer, as it became clear that Greeks would be hit by yet more austerity to foot the bill for saving their country from economic collapse, they realised their business would go bust if it continued operating legally. \u201cWe did our sums and understood that staying put made no sense at all,\u201d says one sibling. \u201cIf we didn\u2019t [offer] receipts, if we avoided taxes and social security contributions, we could just about make ends meet.\u201d They are far from being alone. A year after debt-stricken Greece received its third financial rescue in the form of international funding worth \u20ac86bn, such survival techniques have become commonplace. For a middle class eviscerated by relentless rounds of cuts and tax rises \u2013 the price of the country\u2019s ongoing struggle to avert bankruptcy \u2013 the draconian conditions attached to the latest bailout are invariably invoked in their defence. Measures ranging from the overhaul of the pension system to indirect duties \u2013 slapped on beer, fuel and almost everything in between \u2013 and a controversial increase in VAT are similarly cited by Greeks now reneging on loan repayments, property taxes and energy bills. Against a backdrop of monumental debt \u2013 \u20ac320bn, or 180% of GDP, the accumulation of decades of profligacy \u2013 fatalism is fast replacing pessimism on the streets. \u201cOur country is doomed,\u201d sighs Savvas Tzironis, summing up the mood. \u201cEverything goes from bad to worse.\u201d Close to half a million Greeks are believed to have migrated since the crisis begun, thanks to the searing effect of persistent unemployment (at just under 24%, the highest in Europe) and an economy that has shed more than a third of its total output over the past six years. The nation has been assigned some \u20ac326bn in bailout loans since May 2010 \u2013 the biggest rescue programme in global financial history. Yet the fear that it is locked in an economic death spiral was given further credence last week when Eurobank analysts announced that consumption and exports had also fallen, by 6.4% and 7.2%, in the second quarter of the year. The duration and depth of the recession is such that the World Bank now compares it to the slumps seen in eastern European countries in the early 1990s. The poorest 20% of Greece\u2019s 11 million people have suffered a 42% drop in disposable income since 2009. \u201cIf we continue down this road, a fourth, even a fifth, bailout should be expected,\u201d says Aristides Hatzis, associate professor of law and economics at Athens University. \u201cI don\u2019t see any progress. The economy is stagnant, the private sector devastated, the public administration underfunded and ineffective. And there is always the spectre of Grexit at the end of the tunnel.\u201d The 14 August bailout deal was meant to have put paid to that. Announcing the agreement after months of negotiations that not only brought Athens to the brink of euro exit but provoked the continent\u2019s biggest existential crisis in recent times, EU commission president Jean-Claude Juncker chirpily announced that Greece was \u201cirreversibly\u201d part of the euro area. The 19-member currency bloc had \u201clooked into the abyss\u201d, but henceforth, he said, there was no looking back. A year on, however, there are many who would argue otherwise. In many ways, the Greek debt drama has disappeared in the folds of other crises now stalking Europe: in quick succession, fractious debate has moved from the influx of refugees through the Aegean islands to repeated terrorist attacks and Britain\u2019s shock referendum vote to leave the EU. The runaway train that was carrying Greeks downhill at the height of the crisis has slowed down to the point where loss and sacrifice have almost been normalised. The gradual relaxation of capital controls \u2013 imposed to prevent a run on banks as fears grew that Greece might crash out of the eurozone \u2013 has helped reinforce the sense that the economy has returned to a path of stability. The global lack of appetite for any more Greek drama is such that eurozone finance ministers disbursed a whopping \u20ac10.3bn in emergency loans in June and made an unprecedented promise of debt relief when the current programme finishes in 2018, on condition that Athens presses ahead with yet more unpopular reforms. The country is predicted to see growth of 2.5% next year. \u201cNo economy can withstand endless recession and stagnation,\u201d says George Pagoulatos, professor of European politics and economy at Athens University. \u201cAt some point there could be a change of preferences, with forces who would want to continue outside the euro,\u201d he adds. \u201cIt is anyone\u2019s bet what will happen if the economy doesn\u2019t [exhibit] a strong recovery in 2017.\u201d But few believe it will get better before it gets worse. After promising to eradicate austerity, the once popular leftwing prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, is now a reviled figure. Anti\u2013EU sentiment is on the rise. In October, 70% thought it better for Greece to remain in the single currency; by July those backing the euro had fallen to 50%. Real recovery can only come if the country\u2019s staggering debt burden is reduced. Without debt relief, the International Monetary Fund, which has yet to participate in the latest rescue, believes interest payments on the growing pile will account for 60% of the budget by 2060. In an excoriating review of its own role in the crisis, the IMF\u2019s internal watchdog recently admitted to a litany of mistakes, including the failure to foresee the recessionary impact of austerity on an economy curtailed by corruption and vested interests. Almost all agree that last summer\u2019s bailout simply kicks the can down the road \u2013 an art EU mandarins have mastered since Greece\u2019s ordeal by financial collapse begun. Europe\u2019s weakest link will face further tumult when the latest measures kick in this autumn and the Syriza-led government is forced to enact contentious employment reforms to secure a further \u20ac2.8bn in loans. \u201cI wish I could say Greece has been on the mend over the last year,\u201d says George Papaconstantinou, who oversaw the country\u2019s first rescue package as finance minister. \u201cInstead we are witnessing a double-dip recession that can be wholly ascribed to Syriza\u2019s first six months in office, which almost destroyed the country and certainly set it back many years.\u201d More than ever, he says, Greece needs large-scale foreign investment to kickstart growth \u2013 investment that is unlikely to happen in the face of government hostility to investors, both domestic and foreign. Papaconstantinou, who has chronicled the crisis in a memoir, Game Over, argues that last summer\u2019s lifeline was all the more tragic for being unnecessary. \u201cWhat really differentiates the latest bailout from the previous ones is that this time around, it could have been avoided,\u201d he writes in the book. \u201cIt became necessary because of a mix of ideological blindness, lack of understanding of basic eurozone rules, unforgivable brinkmanship and plain incompetence during the first six months Syriza was in power.\u201d A year on and Greece, though quiet, remains as febrile as ever on the frontline of the euro storm. Coping with crisis How other countries gripped by the eurozone\u2019s problems have fared Italy In the wake of the British referendum, Italy is Europe\u2019s most pressing problem. The country has lost competitiveness since joining the euro and has experienced two lost economic decades during which growth has barely risen. The country\u2019s banks are awash with bad debts. Prime minister Matteo Renzi has called a referendum on constitutional reform for October. Defeat on this would spark a political crisis, and probably an economic crisis as well. Spain Along with Italy, this was the country that looked to be in the most trouble in 2012, when interest rates on its bonds rose to dangerously high levels. Since then, Spain has performed the stronger, and in the second quarter of 2016, its economy grew by 0.7% compared with Italy\u2019s 0.1%. Spain has squeezed domestic costs and taken advantage of a weaker euro to boost its exports. Loose fiscal policy has also helped stimulate activity. Portugal Like Spain, Portugal\u2019s fiscal policy contravenes eurozone rules; both countries face Brussels sanctions as a result. In most respects, though, Portugal is more akin to Italy than to its Iberian-peninsula neighbour, with a recent record of slow growth, weak productivity and a shaky banking system. As in Italy, the public debt ratio is too high for comfort, and rising. Ireland Of all the countries to receive bailouts during the euro crisis, Ireland has done the best. Strong growth has resumed, albeit partly thanks to the activities of US-owned multinationals, and unemployment has come down. Two potential problems loom, however. First, the housing market \u2013 the source of Ireland\u2019s financial problems during the crisis \u2013 has started to exhibit bubble-like tendencies again. Second, Ireland is the country most exposed to Brexit. Larry Elliott",

    "webTitle": "Whole Foods arrives in Williamsburg: a marriage made in hipster heaven", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "It\u2019s clear by now that Whole Foods\u2019 march toward benevolent, organic, feel-good corporate dominance cannot be stopped. The grocery store \u2013 or \u201cAmerica\u2019s healthiest grocery store\u201d, as it prefers to be known \u2013 has more than 435 outlets across the US, Canada and the UK. And, just last month, Whole Foods plopped down its latest outlet \u2013 in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Williamsburg is a place that, depending on your point of view, is a hub of culture, music and art, or a place that is home to wealthy ad agency workers who want to live in lavish, brand-new condos while still enjoying the \u201cauthenticity\u201d of Brooklyn life. Happily, both perspectives make the neighbourhood prime feeding ground for Whole Foods, given the company\u2019s target audience: an audience that wants the farm-to-table produce and aura of philanthropy you get at a farmers\u2019 market, but with more attractive packaging and nicer shopping baskets. On Friday morning the new store was predictably awash with customers. Whole Foods prides itself on offering local produce, and the Brooklyn plant is no exception. Upon entering, the first thing I saw were some beautiful white orchids. The second thing I saw was a sign above them. \u201cGrown in New Jersey,\u201d it said. It didn\u2019t stop there. There was a cabinet labelled \u201cbaked goods\u201d. It turned out some of the baked goods had been baked right here in Brooklyn. There was even a picture of the bakers. The store features more than 800 Brooklyn-made products from more than 75 Brooklyn suppliers. As I headed downstairs, into the belly of the beast, the store opened up. It is cavernous at 51,000 square feet. As you come down the escalator there is a sign bearing Whole Foods\u2019 \u201chigher purpose\u201d: \u201cNourishing the health and well-being of people and planet by being the authentic purveyor of food for the greater good.\u201d It\u2019s certainly a noble idea, but I rather doubted the sincerity of the message, given it was displayed on one of those letter boards where you can change what it says at any given moment, like messages children craft on refrigerators with magnets. Moving forward, I encountered the fruit and veg section, where I was met by 11 different types of onion. Suffice to say, it is extremely comprehensive. Comprehensive and local. You can buy organic red onions from New York. Organic yellow onions from New York. Horseradish root from New Jersey. That said, there is foreign stuff too. Apples from Argentina. Pears from New Zealand. Sometimes two of the same products, one produced locally, and one produced abroad, are positioned next to each other, enabling shoppers to secretly vent their xenophobia. \u201cScrew you France, I\u2019m buying the New Jersey onion.\u201d \u201cGet stuffed, Holland, my Savoy cabbage is coming from Vermont.\u201d If one of the staples of Whole Foods is healthy, organic produce, another is the pricing. It is expensive. You can buy orange juice \u2013 a 16oz orange juice \u2013 for $7.99. Or 27 organic diapers for $11.99. Or 15oz of chia seeds for $13.99. If it proves anything, it\u2019s that people will pay whatever you charge them. Whole Foods could double the price of its sprouted buckwheat acai blueberry cereal and people would probably still buy it. Just as long as it still contains organic maqui, Himalayan crystal salt and coconut nectar. On Friday Manon Hallay, a 21-year-old dance student and Williamsburg resident, was among the Whole Foods patrons. \u201cIt\u2019s great,\u201d she said as she emerged from the store, blinking in the sunlight. \u201cBut it\u2019s so expensive.\u201d Hallay claimed to have been buying \u201cbreakfast food\u201d. I looked in her bag. It contained one loaf of bread and a bottle of lemonade. Nola Romano, 41, appeared to have done a more comprehensive shop. \u201cMeat and vegetables,\u201d she declared when I asked what she had purchased. \u201cBecause there\u2019s not many places to buy good vegetables round here,\u201d she said. \u201cOr meat.\u201d Romano was dressed in leggings, sneakers and a sports top. Whole Foods is perfectly placed to draw in the healthy-lifestyle crowd, given its location next door to an Equinox gym \u2013 think a normal gym, but priced like maintaining a racehorse \u2013 and many of the customers seemed to be dressed in workout gear. But appearances can be deceiving. \u201cOh it\u2019s a facade,\u201d Romano said when I noted her sporting attire. \u201cI\u2019ve done no exercise today. Except carry these,\u201d she said, motioning to her meat and vegetable bags. Romano also noted the high prices \u2013 \u201calthough if you buy their store brands it\u2019s cheaper\u201d \u2013 but a look around Brooklyn Harvest Market, a couple of blocks away, suggested Whole Foods prices aren\u2019t that different from other local options. The butternut squash was 50c cheaper in Harvest Market, sure, but then the organic diapers were $2 more. The chia seeds were $4 less in Harvest, but Whole Foods offered cheaper yellow onions. So there\u2019s competition. But it seems nobody else does the local produce thing quite like Whole Foods. Or at least nobody else assails their customers with local produce propaganda quite like Whole Foods. And it\u2019s not just that you can find \u201cover 30 cheeses made within 100 miles of here\u201d. It\u2019s that Whole Foods is really good at creating an environment where people want to spend time. In the Williamsburg store they\u2019ve created a faux neighborhood, like on a TV set where there\u2019s a precious manicured street with fake signs and fake store fronts. You can stand outside \u201cFine Cuts\u201d butchers and watch a real-life butcher handling his meat. You can sit in the \u201cN4 taproom\u201d and drink a local IPA while enjoying the sports on TV. You can flip through the New York Times style section as you drink a latte in the coffee shop. Or maybe you\u2019d like to pay a visit to the smoothie bar. Or visit Luke\u2019s Lobster \u201ctail cart\u201d \u2013 an old-fashioned wooden thing where someone who may or may not actually be called Luke sells lobster tails from Maine. You could even stop in at the vegan and paleo parfait bar for a chat over some chickpeas. The resulting atmosphere is more food hall than big-box grocery store. It is relaxing. It is homey. It is aspirational. It feels like a community. It isn\u2019t, though. \u201cAre you trying to sell me something? If you\u2019re trying to sell me something then don\u2019t fucking talk to me,\u201d said a woman leaving the store as I trotted over with my notebook. After spending an hour in Whole Foods I felt I knew how to talk to their customers. I opened my mouth to explain. \u2018I\u2019m locally sourced!\u2019 I wanted to say. \u2018I\u2019m 100% organic!\u2019 \u2018I\u2019m expensive!\u2019 I didn\u2019t get the chance. \u201cI\u2019m in a hurry,\u201d the woman called over her shoulder as she ran across the street. Not even Whole Foods can ensure every customer leaves in a good mood.",

      "body": "<p></p> <p>It\u2019s clear by now that Whole Foods\u2019 march toward benevolent, organic, feel-good corporate dominance cannot be stopped. </p> <p>The grocery store \u2013 or \u201cAmerica\u2019s healthiest grocery store\u201d, as it <a href=\"http://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/\">prefers to be known</a> \u2013 has more than <a href=\"http://media.wholefoodsmarket.com/fast-facts/\">435 outlets</a> across the US, Canada and the UK.</p> <p>And, just last month, Whole Foods plopped down its latest outlet \u2013 in Williamsburg, Brooklyn.</p> <p>Williamsburg is a place that, depending on your point of view, is a hub of culture, music and art, or a place that is home to wealthy ad agency workers who want to live in lavish, brand-new condos while still enjoying the \u201cauthenticity\u201d of Brooklyn life. </p> <p>Happily, both perspectives make the neighbourhood prime feeding ground for Whole Foods, given the company\u2019s target audience: an audience that wants the farm-to-table produce and aura of philanthropy you get at a farmers\u2019 market, but with more attractive packaging and nicer shopping baskets.</p> <p>On Friday morning the new store was predictably awash with customers. Whole Foods prides itself on offering local produce, and the Brooklyn plant is no exception. Upon entering, the first thing I saw were some beautiful white orchids. The second thing I saw was a sign above them. \u201cGrown in New Jersey,\u201d it said.</p> <p>It didn\u2019t stop there. There was a cabinet labelled \u201cbaked goods\u201d. It turned out some of the baked goods had been baked right here in Brooklyn. There was even a picture of the bakers. The store features more than 800 Brooklyn-made products from more than 75 Brooklyn suppliers. </p> <p>As I headed downstairs, into the belly of the beast, the store opened up. It is cavernous at 51,000 square feet. As you come down the escalator there is a sign bearing Whole Foods\u2019 \u201chigher purpose\u201d: </p> <p>\u201cNourishing the health and well-being of people and planet by being the authentic purveyor of food for the greater good.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s certainly a noble idea, but I rather doubted the sincerity of the message, given it was displayed on one of those letter boards where you can change what it says at any given moment, like messages children craft on refrigerators with magnets. </p> <p>Moving forward, I encountered the fruit and veg section, where I was met by 11 different types of onion. </p> <p>Suffice to say, it is extremely comprehensive. Comprehensive and local. You can buy organic red onions from New York. Organic yellow onions from New York. Horseradish root from New Jersey.</p> <p>That said, there is foreign stuff too. Apples from Argentina. Pears from New Zealand.</p> <p>Sometimes two of the same products, one produced locally, and one produced abroad, are positioned next to each other, enabling shoppers to secretly vent their xenophobia.</p> <p>\u201cScrew you France, I\u2019m buying the New Jersey onion.\u201d \u201cGet stuffed, Holland, my Savoy cabbage is coming from Vermont.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/28/whole-foods-new-york-city-overcharging-food-labels\">Whole Foods to pay $500,000 to New York City for overcharging allegations</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If one of the staples of Whole Foods is healthy, organic produce, another is the pricing. It is expensive. You can buy orange juice \u2013 a 16oz orange juice \u2013 for $7.99. Or 27 organic diapers for $11.99. Or 15oz of chia seeds for $13.99.</p> <p>If it proves anything, it\u2019s that people will pay whatever you charge them. Whole Foods could double the price of its sprouted buckwheat acai blueberry cereal and people would probably still buy it. Just as long as it still contains organic maqui, Himalayan crystal salt and coconut nectar. </p> <p>On Friday Manon Hallay, a 21-year-old dance student and Williamsburg resident, was among the Whole Foods patrons. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s great,\u201d she said as she emerged from the store, blinking in the sunlight. \u201cBut it\u2019s so expensive.\u201d</p> <p>Hallay claimed to have been buying \u201cbreakfast food\u201d. I looked in her bag. It contained one loaf of bread and a bottle of lemonade.</p> <p>Nola Romano, 41, appeared to have done a more comprehensive shop. </p> <p>\u201cMeat and vegetables,\u201d she declared when I asked what she had purchased. </p> <p>\u201cBecause there\u2019s not many places to buy good vegetables round here,\u201d she said. \u201cOr meat.\u201d</p> <p>Romano was dressed in leggings, sneakers and a sports top. Whole Foods is perfectly placed to draw in the healthy-lifestyle crowd, given its location next door to an Equinox gym \u2013 think a normal gym, but priced like maintaining a racehorse \u2013 and many of the customers seemed to be dressed in workout gear. But appearances can be deceiving.</p> <p>\u201cOh it\u2019s a facade,\u201d Romano said when I noted her sporting attire.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve done no exercise today. Except carry these,\u201d she said, motioning to her meat and vegetable bags.</p> <p>Romano also noted the high prices \u2013 \u201calthough if you buy their store brands it\u2019s cheaper\u201d \u2013 but a look around Brooklyn Harvest Market, a couple of blocks away, suggested Whole Foods prices aren\u2019t that different from other local options. The butternut squash was 50c cheaper in Harvest Market, sure, but then the organic diapers were $2 more. The chia seeds were $4 less in Harvest, but Whole Foods offered cheaper yellow onions.</p> <p>So there\u2019s competition. But it seems nobody else does the local produce thing quite like Whole Foods. Or at least nobody else assails their customers with local produce propaganda quite like Whole Foods. </p> <p>And it\u2019s not just that you can find \u201cover 30 cheeses made within 100 miles of here\u201d. It\u2019s that Whole Foods is really good at creating an environment where people want to spend time. </p> <p>In the Williamsburg store they\u2019ve created a faux neighborhood, like on a TV set where there\u2019s a precious manicured street with fake signs and fake store fronts. You can stand outside \u201cFine Cuts\u201d butchers and watch a real-life butcher handling his meat. You can sit in the \u201cN4 taproom\u201d and drink a local IPA while enjoying the sports on TV. You can flip through the New York Times style section as you drink a latte in the coffee shop. </p> <p>Or maybe you\u2019d like to pay a visit to the smoothie bar. Or visit Luke\u2019s Lobster \u201ctail cart\u201d \u2013 an old-fashioned wooden thing where someone who may or may not actually be called Luke sells lobster tails from Maine. You could even stop in at the vegan and paleo parfait bar for a chat over some chickpeas. The resulting atmosphere is more food hall than big-box grocery store.</p> <p>It is relaxing. It is homey. It is aspirational. It feels like a community.</p> <p>It isn\u2019t, though. </p> <p>\u201cAre you trying to sell me something?
