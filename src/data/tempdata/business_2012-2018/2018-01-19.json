      "bodyText": "A committee of MPs has demanded answers from the trustees of Carillion\u2019s pension scheme and regulators as it opened an investigation into how the company collapsed, leaving behind a retirement scheme with a deficit set to hit \u00a3900m. Frank Field MP, who chairs the work and pensions select committee, said the company\u2019s implosion \u201cbegs questions across government\u201d and promised to take evidence from directors and Carillion\u2019s auditor KPMG. As the committee launched its investigation, some of Carillion\u2019s former staff were thrown a lifeline by Network Rail, which agreed to continue paying contract staff until April. Royal Bank of Scotland, one of the high street banks that have offered \u00a3225m of relief for affected businesses, said it would extend support to any personal banking customers hit by Carillion\u2019s failure. As ministers and businesses counted the cost of Carillion\u2019s demise, Field wrote to Robin Ellison, the chair of the trustees of Carillion\u2019s 28,000-member retirement schemes, and Lesley Titcomb, the chief executive of the Pensions Regulator. \u201cIt beggars belief that a company can be allowed to run with such apparent recklessness \u2013 and be so lucrative for the directors and shareholders \u2013 when it has a giant pension deficit and a mountain of debt,\u201d said Field. He asked what assurances trustees sought from Carillion about its business model and what action they took after its first profit warning last July. He also asked the trustees and the Pensions Regulator if they had known that chairman Philip Green was found guilty by the pension ombudsman in 1994 of a breach of trust and maladministration regarding the pension scheme of wallpaper firm Coloroll. Titcomb was asked whether TPR was investigating Carillion and how it reacted to the company\u2019s first profit warning. Carillion\u2019s multiple pension schemes are set to be taken on by the Pension Protection Fund, the government\u2019s lifeboat for retirement schemes that are in deficit when companies go bust. While the PPF has enough of a surplus to absorb the estimated \u00a3900m liabilities, the largest it has ever taken on, pensioners are expected to see their payouts cut by 15%. A government taskforce has sought to coordinate offers of relief for affected suppliers from banks and Carillion\u2019s corporate clients. On Friday, Network Rail joined Centrica and Nationwide in offering to pay former Carillion contractors until April at least. Train company Arriva said: \u201cWe are working closely with Carillion to support their employees at this difficult time, which includes arrangements to ensure staff working on our contracts continue to be paid.\u201d RBS said on Friday that any affected staff could get refunds on overdraft charges, waivers on withdrawal fees and loan repayments holidays.",

    "webTitle": "UK retail sales fall sharply in December, US consumer confidence dips - as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Despite the stronger euro as the dollar weakens, European markets have ended the week on a positive note with the Stoxx index at its highest level for ten years. Growing hopes about company earnings and growth in the economy have combined to offset any negative concerns. In the UK the FTSE 100 has also finished higher, despite a weak performance from retailers after disappointing high street sales figures for December. In the US, early optimism has receded, as investors await news on whether the government faces a shutdown. Worse than expected US consumer confidence figures have also hit sentiment. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 29.83 points or 0.39% at 7730.79 Germany\u2019s Dax rose 1.15% to 13,434.45 France\u2019s Cac climbed 0.58% to 5526.51 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB was 0.5% better at 23,749.22 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 0.45% at 10,479.5 In Greece, the Athens market added 1.19% to 847.56 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 55 points or 0.21%. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, have a good weekend, and we\u2019ll be back on Monday. Here\u2019s our latest on Carillion. Rob Davies writes: The chair of the British Medical Association has demanded answers about the future of two major hospitals that Carillion was building when it collapsed, amid mounting concern about the impact of any delays on stretched NHS services. Patients\u2019 groups joined the doctors\u2019 trade body in calling for clarity after local NHS trusts admitted that work on the \u00a3335m Royal Liverpool University and Birmingham\u2019s \u00a3350m Midland Metropolitan hospitals is on hold. Aidan Kehoe, chief executive of the Royal Liverpool and Broadgreen University hospitals NHS trust, said Carillion\u2019s liquidation would further postpone a project that has already been delayed twice. The full story is here: Dr Harm Bandholz, chief US economist at UniCredit, agrees the impact of a US government shutdown should be modest. But given that could be the case, it might make such a move more likely. He said: The impact of a shutdown, if it happens, on the economy should be very limited as it affects only so-called \u2018non-essential\u2019 government services. Financial markets may also be inclined to discount this renewed display of dysfunctionality in Washington as the tax bill has already been passed. This could be yet another reason why Democrats as well as Republicans may be willing to take a stand and shut the government down That said, they currently still have another 13 hours to prevent such an embarrassment. How bad would a US government shutdown be. Paul Ashworth at Capital Economics said: It is still possible that Congress will reach a late deal to avoid a partial government shutdown, but the chances of agreement seem to be slipping away. That said, even if it lasted for a week or more, a shutdown would have only a modest impact on first quarter GDP growth. Oil prices are on track for their biggest weekly fall since October as a recent rally fizzles out. A rise in US production has outweighed declines in inventories, and the output cap agreed by Opec and Russia. Analysts had always expected US shale producers to ramp up their activities as the crude price recovered, providing a counterpoint to the Opec attempts to reduce supplies. The International Energy Agency said in its latest report that global oil stocks had tightened, but it pointed out that the US production increases would have an impact. Brent crude, which hit a three year peak of $70.37 a barrel on Monday, is now down 1% on the day at $68.62. Back with UK retail sales, and while the FTSE 100 might be in positive territory, the representatives from the high street are having a bad day all round. B&amp;Q owner Kingfisher is down 2.6%, the biggest faller in the leading index. It has been hit by, not only the disappointing retail sales figures themselves, but also the profit warning from Carpetright, suggesting big ticket home improvement items are off the agenda at the moment for UK consumers. Carpetright meanwhile is down a massive 43%. Also on the slide are shares in Next, down 1.9%, Tesco, 0.7% lower and - in the FTSE 250 - Dixons Carphone, off 2.6%. The survey indicated some uncertainty about Donald Trump\u2019s tax cuts, especially the timing of any benefits to consumers, but the bulk of those questioned though the reform would be positive. The survey\u2019s chief economist Richard Curtin said: While the preliminary January reading for the Sentiment Index was largely unchanged from last month (-1.5%), consumers evaluated current economic conditions less favorably (-4.6%). This small decrease in current conditions produced a small overall decline. Importantly, the survey recorded persistent strength in personal finances and buying plans, while favorable levels of buying conditions for household durables have receded to preholiday levels in early January, largely due to less attractive pricing. The Expectations Index remained virtually unchanged at 84.8. Tax reform was spontaneously mentioned by 34% of all respondents; 70% of those who mentioned tax reform thought the impact would be positive, and 18% said it would be negative. The disconnect between the future outlook assessment and the largely positive view of the tax reform is due to uncertainties about the delayed impact of the tax reforms on the consumers. Some of the uncertainty is related to how much a cut or an increase people, especially high income households who live in high-tax states, face Near and long term gas price expectations inched upward in early January but remained significantly below their peak. While long term inflation expectation remained at its 2017 average level and short term inflation expectation inched upward, consumers continued to remain very optimistic about the low national unemployment rate. Meanwhile the latest US economic indicator has come in below expectations. The University of Michigan survey of consumer sentiment came in at 94.4 in January, down from December\u2019s final figure of 95.9 and below analysts\u2019 forecasts of a rise to 97. Although of course there are contigency plans being put in place, just in case the US government does shut down...... Here\u2019s our piece earlier on the attempts to prevent a US government shutdown: As expected, US markets have made a positive start, with investors seemingly untroubled by the prospect of a government shutdown. As well as the feeling that a resolution will be found at a vote in the Senate later, the political risks are overshadowed for the moment by optimism over company results during the earnings season. So the Dow Jones Industrial Average is 12 points or 0.07% higher while the S&amp;P 500 opened up 0.24% and the Nasdaq Composite 0.32%. There are a couple of potential market moving events ahead in fact: Craig Erlam, analyst at the currency firm Oanda, says US investors are likely to shrug off fears over a US government shutdown when the opening bell rings on Wall Street: US equity markets are seen reversing Thursday\u2019s losses at the open on Friday, even as investors prepare for the first government shutdown since 2013 if the Senate doesn\u2019t pass a temporary spending bill. Investors don\u2019t appear particularly bothered about the prospect of a government shutdown, with the assumption being that one will eventually be signed and any economic impact will be minor or non-existent. While the US dollar has remained under significant pressure, there is little to suggest this is related to the budget talks while rising US yields is likely more a reflection of the general central bank tightening environment. The backdrop for UK consumers will remain tough in 2018 before easing in 2019, according to Andrew Sentance, senior economic adviser at PwC. Commenting on the weak retail sales data out this morning, the former member of the Bank of England\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee says: Taking 2018 as a whole, prices are still likely to increase more than wages, so this will be another year of consumer squeeze. As a result, we expect economic growth to be around 1.5%, not disastrous, but disappointing compared with the mid 2010s. Weak consumer spending will continue to be a drag on the UK economy in 2018, but the prospects are brighter for 2019 and beyond - as long as we get a reasonable Brexit deal with the other EU-27 countries. Greece has won rare praise today from EU commission\u2019s chief spokesperson, Margaritis Schinas, fuelling hopes that debt relief talks could soon be in the offing. Helena Smith reports from Athens: Four days after MPs endorsed more biting austerity measures and reforms in a rowdy parliamentary vote, Greece\u2019s fiscal progress was roundly applauded by the man more usually associated with tough words for the country. In an interview with state-run ERT TV, EU commission spokesman Margaritis Schinas described the bailout compliance review Athens is currently conducting with creditors as a \u201cmodel review\u201d that was \u201cgoing very well.\u201d \u201cEveryone wants Greece to stand firmly on its feet,\u201d he said, insisting it was imperative that forces inside the country supported the corrective economic adjustment reforms that had been legislated under international economic supervision under the three emergency rescue programmes Athens had received. Now that the latest bailout review was about to be concluded \u2013 with eurozone finance ministers expected to unlock up to \u20ac6bn in aid for the country when they meet in Brussels on Monday - discussion on Greece\u2019s post-bailout era could begin, he said. \u201cFrom September, the political winds in Europe have changed,\u201d Schinas said. \u201cFor the first time all of our economies are in growth \u2026 and the euro is regaining its place as an anchor of stability on the world scene.\u201d Back in 2015, Yanis Varoufakis said he Alexis Tsipras whether he was \u201ccompletely stupid\u201d* after the Greek prime minister agreed to a demand by international creditors in for large primary surpluses. Speaking to Parapolitika radio about his time as Greek finance minister, Varoufakis said: I told him: \u2018Are you completely stupid? What did you get in return?\u2019 And he said: \u2018Oh, did I do something stupid? It\u2019s OK, we\u2019ll take it back\u2019. Varoufakis criticised his successor Euclid Tsakalotos, calling him a \u201cyes man\u201d who \u201cI no longer recognise\u201d. Ouch. *Varoufakis said he did not actually use the word \u201cstupid,\u201d it was worse than that. Here\u2019s quick markets round-up from Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets: Equities are positive to close out the week, rebounding from a negative US close and ahead of a key Senate vote to stave off a government shutdown tonight. Weaker than expected UK retail sales have seen the UK\u2019s blue chip index take a leg higher, benefiting from sterling\u2019s retreat from fresh post-referendum highs earlier this morning. Interestingly, Germany\u2019s DAX is the rank outperformer, this in spite of additional euro strength after hawkish ECB comments, whilst US equities point towards a positive open this afternoon. The FTSE has climbed higher thanks to the pound\u2019s weakness...while miners are embracing the weaker dollar\u2019s fillip for metals. The FTSE 100 is currently up 0.28% at 7722 while Germany\u2019s Dax is up just over 1% and France\u2019s Cac has climbed 0.47%. Over in the US the Dow Jones Industrial Average is forecast to open around 88 points higher. As for the pound, it is down 0.12% against the dollar at $1.3875 - despite the pressures on the US currency - and 0.27% lower against the euro at \u20ac1.1317. It\u2019s that time of year again when world leaders and big thinkers prepare to head to the Swiss ski resort Davos to debate the most pressing social and economic issues. Angela Merkel, the German Chancellor, is the latest world leader to confirm her attendance at the event next week, joining Donald Trump, Theresa May, Justin Trudeau and Emmanuel Macron among others. The work and pensions select committee has written to the pensions regulator with a series of questions on Carillion. Publishing the letter, Frank Field, Labour MP and chair of the committee, said: I am pleased that the liaison committee will be investigating Carillion - the company\u2019s collapse begs questions across government. We have some specific concerns on the pensions side. It beggars belief that a company can be allowed to run with such apparent recklessness - and be so lucrative for the directors and shareholders - when it has a giant pension deficit and a mountain of debt. I will be proposing we take evidence from the company directors, the trustees, the pensions regulator and the auditors who somehow concluded Carillion was a going concern. Where our concerns overlap we will look to work closely with the business committee, as we have done successfully in the past. The dollar index, which measures the US currency against a basket of other major currencies, has hit a new three-year low today of 90.331 as fears of a US government shutdown mount. Analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch believe the dollar will recover some ground against the euro in the coming months. Support for EUR/USD from forward rate divergence may be peaking whilst markets look ahead to the European Central Bank meeting and any commentary on the euro from European Central Bank president Mario Draghi. EUR/USD could be vulnerable from a dovish Draghi. The USD has sharply weakened as a result of the recent wave of global central bank repricing, despite strong US data. EUR/USD appreciation has been supported by relative interest rate expectations, however upside potential looks limited for now. A USD rebound is likely in the first half of 2018, predicated on corporate repatriation flows and vastly underpriced Fed vs ECB expectations. More here on this morning\u2019s dismal UK retail sales data: The STOXX 600, comprising some of the biggest companies across Europe, is at the highest level since August 2015: Investors are in buoyant mood this morning, with gains in all major markets despite the strength of the euro and the pound against the dollar. The FTSE is up 15 points. Latest scores: FTSE 100: +0.2% at 7,716 Germany\u2019s DAX: +0.9% at 13,399 France\u2019s CAC: +0.4% at 5,518 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: +0.8% at 23,824 Spain\u2019s IBEX: +0.4% at 10,475 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: +0.4% at 400 Ruth Gregory at Capital Economics says the drop in December retail sales signals \u201ca disappointing end to 2017\u201d. We\u2019ll get the first official estimate of UK economic growth in the final quarter of 2017 from the ONS next week, on 26 January. As it stands, economists polled by Reuters are predicting growth of 0.4% in the fourth quarter, the same rate as the third quarter. Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown, says retail sales did little to boost the economy in the final quarter of 2017. We\u2019ve been waiting for the pay squeeze to filter through to the high street, but so far retail sales have held up better than many expected. Today\u2019s retail sales data from the ONS disappointed, however, with consumers cutting back on Christmas spending after November\u2019s Black Friday splurge. This continues the trend of bringing Christmas spending forward to take advantage of early discounts. The figures undershot expectations by some margin, falling 1.5% on the month and rising just 1.4% year-on-year. Economists had forecast the latter number at 3.0%. This means retail sales made next to no contribution to UK economic growth in the final three months of 2017. The big question now is whether this is the start of a worrying trend for the economy, or whether falling inflation and rising wages will come to the rescue. The figures from the ONS show that retail sales on 2017 overall rose by 1.9% - the weakest annual growth rate since 2013. The drop in UK retail sales in December has so far failed to hit the pound, which is still up 0.2% at $1.3918. Sterling is down 0.1% against the euro, at \u20ac1.1332, not far off where it was before the retail figures were published. The sharp fall in retail sales over the month of December (-1.5%) can partly be explained be Black Friday sales, which encouraged shoppers to bring forward some of their Christmas spending to November. But people are also finding they have less money to spend because prices are rising faster than wages. Rhian Murphy, a senior statistician at the ONS, explains: Retail sales continued to grow in the last three months of the year partly due to Black Friday deals boosting spending. Consumers continue to move Christmas purchases earlier with higher spending in November and lower spending in December than seen in previous years. However, the longer-term picture is one of slowing growth, with increased prices squeezing people\u2019s spending. Over the year the proportion of internet spending is continuing to rise, with almost one in every five pounds spent online by the end of 2017. Ouch. UK retail sales fell by 1.5% in December, more sharply than the 0.6% drop forecast by economists. It was also a lot worse than November, when sales rose 1%. More soon. The market value of Dignity, one of Britain\u2019s biggest funeral providers, has halved this morning after the company warned that it would have to cut its prices this year as a result of intense competition. Shares are down 50% at 959p, making it the biggest faller on the FTSE 250. Dignity said that while its profits for 2017 were in line with expectations, 2018 would be a different story because it planned to cut the price of some of its funeral services. While the pre-arranged and crematoria businesses are performing strongly with no change to the board\u2019s expectations for these businesses, the board is keen to address the continuing acceleration of price competition facing its funeral business. The board is therefore taking decisive action on its funeral pricing strategy with a view to protecting market share and repositioning the group for future growth. Consequently, the board believes that the results for the period ending 28 December 2018 will be substantially below the market\u2019s current expectations. Effective immediately, the group\u2019s simple funeral will be reduced by an average of approximately 25% and there will also be a price freeze for the group\u2019s traditional funerals in the majority of the group\u2019s locations. Consequently, the group is now embarking on a rigorous review to ensure that its funeral operations are organised to run more efficiently and effectively. The business secretary Greg Clark was put on the defensive when interviewed about Carillion by Nick Robinson on Today. Main points from Clark: Minsters did not meet Carillion bosses at any time after the profit warnings (which began last summer) but were kept informed by \u201cofficials\u201d. Powers are available to the Insolvency Service to claw back bonuses from Carillion\u2019s bosses. He couldn\u2019t say whether the thousands of small businesses owed money by Carillion would be paid. That is a matter for the Insolvency Service. The government was right to keep awarding contracts to Carillion. It will be held to account on these decisions in the coming months. Clark is asked by Nick Robinson why was there no contact between Carillion and senior ministers at any time after the profit warnings, which began in July 2017. Actually there was substantial contact between the crown commercial service who are responsible for the oversight of public sector contracts. That is the appropriate mechanism, you have senior officials monitoring these contracts. Officials report to ministers. So ministers did know that Carillion was in trouble? So why carry on handing them contracts? I think that everyone in the whole country could see the profit warnings that were issued. Many companies give profit warnings, that means they expect to make less money than they had previously forecast. If the government on each occasion downed tools and said we could no longer do business, that would cause difficulties for many companies that were healthy and viable. Over the months ahead there will be lots of opportunities to scrutinise the decisions that were taken. That is right and proper. On the issue of clawing back bonuses from Carillion\u2019s top executives, Greg Clark says the powers exist and will be used where necessary. The Insolvency Service have very powerful sanctions available here. I wrote to the head of the service to make sure the receiver looked not just at the conduct of the current directors, but the previous ones to see if they had contributed to this collapse. And the sanctions including the recovery of bonuses that may have been paid are very substantial and they are available to the Insolvency Service. Greg Clark has been on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme talking about Carillion and the taskforce meeting he held on Thursday. He says he is working closely with business organisations, trade unions, banks and the department of work and pensions to make sure everything is done to \u201cmaximise the continuity of these small businesses\u201d that were suppliers to the collapsed Carillion. However, he says the issue of whether these small suppliers will get the money they are owed is a matter for the receivers and not the government. The job of the official receiver is to wind the company up in an orderly way, to realise the assets, and to deal with creditors claims ... so make an assessment of how much people will get back. Our latest story on Carillion: Shares in Carpetright have plunged in early trading after a major profits warning. They are down 48% at 85p. The flooring company said post Christmas trading had been \u201csignificantly behind expectations\u201d and warned full-year profits would come in somewhere between \u00a32m to \u00a36m. The City had been expecting up to \u00a315.6m. Another sign that consumers are growing increasingly reluctant to commit to major, non essential, spending decisions at a time when inflation is outpacing wage growth. Chief executive Wilf Walsh: Despite a positive start to our third quarter, we have seen a significant deterioration in UK trading during the important post-Christmas trading period. While average transaction values were up year on year, the number of customer transactions since Christmas was sharply down, which we believe is indicative of reduced consumer confidence. The severity of the decline in footfall over this key trading period and our more cautious view of the outlook for the balance of the year leads to a significant reduction in our full year expectations. Against this background of a further deterioration in market conditions, we remain committed to driving through the improvements that are essential to the long term repositioning of the business. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The pound is holding on to its post Brexit-vote highs against the dollar, up 0.2% this morning at $1.3917. It is on course for a fifth weekly rise against the US currency. Sterling has been supported by a number of factors, including optimism over Brexit negotiations, some decent data, and dollar weakness. Michael Hewson at CMC Markets gives his view: It\u2019s been another decent week for the pound as it looks set to post its fifth successive weekly rise in a row against the US dollar. A new post Brexit vote high of $1.3943 this week has raised expectations of a move through the $1.40 area in the next few days in the hope that a more convivial tone will develop between Brussels and London as the prospect of the upcoming trade talks looms on the horizon. While that remains highly optimistic, sterling short positions have continued to get squeezed hard. The pound is down 0.1% against the euro however, at \u20ac1.1340. UK retail sales data for December, published at 9.30am, will provide insight into whether cash-strapped consumers - under pressure from falling real pay - were willing to spend over the Christmas period. Economists polled by Reuters are predicting a 0.6% fall in sales over the month, following a 1.1% increase in November. However, some analysts suspect the number might come in a touch higher after better-than expected figures from the British Retail Consortium. Also this morning we\u2019ve had profit warnings from Carpetright and the funeral provider Dignity. More on those soon.",

      "bodyText": "The chair of the British Medical Association has demanded answers about the future of two major hospitals that Carillion was building when it collapsed, amid mounting concern about the impact of any delays on stretched NHS services. Patients\u2019 groups joined the doctors\u2019 trade body in calling for clarity after local NHS trusts admitted that work on the \u00a3335m Royal Liverpool University and Birmingham\u2019s \u00a3350m Midland Metropolitan hospitals is on hold. Aidan Kehoe, the chief executive of the Royal Liverpool and Broadgreen University hospitals NHS trust, said Carillion\u2019s liquidation would further postpone a project that had been delayed twice. Dr Chaand Nagpaul, chair of the British Medical Association Council, called for more information about efforts to resume the projects, which are being built as the NHS faces its worst winter crisis in years. \u201cWe urgently need clarity on exactly what is going to happen to the hospitals in Liverpool and Birmingham,\u201d he said. \u201cWith the construction in Liverpool already delayed by more than a year, patients and staff need answers on when construction will resume and if services will be further delayed. \u201cUnfortunately, this is a classic example of what can happen when these PFI [private finance initiative] deals go wrong \u2013 construction stalls, services are delayed or collapse and taxpayers are expected to foot the bill.\u201d Carillion\u2019s collapse has fuelled criticism of PFI deals, in which the government outsources big projects to private firms. The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, vowed to end the \u201cracket\u201d in an interview with the Guardian. The two hospitals were among multimillion-pound public-private partnership (PPP) contracts that were proving far more costly than Carillion had hoped and have been cited as key contributors to the company\u2019s financial failure. While the government has agreed to keep funding Carillion\u2019s public sector staff in an effort to prevent disruption to public services, the future of the hospitals, planned to serve densely populated urban areas, is less certain. A Department of Health spokesperson said: \u201cThe government is doing everything possible to minimise the impact and along with the hospital regulator NHS Improvement we will continue to support all NHS organisations involved to ensure there are plans in place to keep any construction delays to a minimum.\u201d Jonathan Ashworth MP, Labour\u2019s shadow health secretary, said: \u201cThe collapse of Carillion has extremely serious implications for those hospital trusts with a relationship to the firm. \u201cIn the midst of an unprecedented winter crisis, the government must urgently reassure patients and staff that their meals will still be cooked, hospital wards cleaned and that construction on new hospitals will not cease.\u201d Workers were sent home earlier this week from the sites, overseen by two firms jointly owned by Carillion, both called the Hospital Company. Lenders to the two developments, which include the European Investment Bank, French bank Cr\u00e9dit Agricole and Legal &amp; General pensions, are understood to have attended emergency talks with the government this week. But local NHS trusts admitted on Friday that they did not know when new contractors would be found to resume work on the hospitals, which were running well behind schedule. The Royal Liverpool was originally due to be completed in March 2017 but has faced successive delays, after workers found asbestos in the ground and cracks in concrete beams. It was expected to open in June 2018 but the local NHS trust admitted it now does not know when the building will be finished. Aidan Kehoe, chief executive of the Royal Liverpool and Broadgreen University hospitals NHS trust said contingency plans were under way to minimise disruption but said \u201cvery little\u201d work was going on at the state-of-the-art 646-bed hospital, where patients will enjoy their own private en-suite rooms. \u201cHandover of the new Royal has already been delayed,\u201d he said. \u201cWe expect that the liquidation of Carillion will add to that delay.\u201d Kehoe said the Hospital Company, a special purpose vehicle that houses the project, run by a board composed largely of former Carillion staff, was working to find a new contractor. He said the hospital would still be built and that the Hospital Company has insurance funds to fund its resumption. The Midland Metropolitan, in Smethwick, west Birmingham, was originally scheduled for completion in autumn this year but has also been hit by engineering problems, pushing it back to June 2019. Sandwell and West Birmingham NHS trust chief executive Toby Lewis said in a video that work would be on hold for \u201csome weeks or even longer\u201d. Liz McAnulty, chair of the Patients Association, said: \u201cThe impact of the collapse of Carillion on patients is currently unclear and will vary a lot according to local circumstances. We would hope that any major NHS construction projects would have safeguards and contingency planning in place.\u201d As the future of the two hospitals was thrown into doubt, documents obtained by the Guardian under freedom of information showed that Carillion won the contract to build the Royal Liverpool University hospital after a tendering process in which cost savings were prioritised. The company was lagging behind a consortium called Horizon in the interim stage of bidding, according to a document released by the council, but leapfrogged its rival at the final stage. A separate document showing the criteria for awarding the contract revealed that this final stage, when Carillion moved ahead, put greater stress on the importance of keeping costs down. One criterion that was added reads: \u201cBidders should include detailed assumptions and calculations of the projected savings in their written submission.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "A price war in the funeral business has forced one of the UK\u2019s biggest undertakers to slash the cost of its cheapest funeral by 25%. On Friday almost \u00a3500m was wiped off the market value of Dignity, the UK\u2019s only publicly listed funeral services company, after it warned that increasingly tough competition in the budget end of the market would have a dramatic effect on the firm\u2019s profitability in the future. Dignity\u2019s hand was forced by the Co-op, which started cutting its prices in 2016. The move by its larger rival hit Dignity\u2019s sales and its 800 funeral homes suffered a near 7% drop in trade last year. The chief executive of Dignity, Mike McCollum, said the company usually relied on repeat business from families or personal recommendations, but with household budgets under strain hard-up Britons were shopping around for the best deal. \u201cThere is a growing part of the market that is price sensitive,\u201d said McCollum. \u201cPeople are going online or phoning around for a quote.\u201d More than a decade of price rises means many families are struggling to afford the send off they want for their loved one. In 2017 the average cost of a basic funeral increased by 4.7% to \u00a34,078, according to a SunLife report called Cost of Dying. It was the 14th year in a row prices had risen, with analysts pointing to examples of families using crowdfunding to cope with the cost of unexpected death. The SunLife report said one in nine families struggled with funeral costs and tried to make savings by buying a cheaper coffin, fewer flowers and in some cases not using a hearse. To win more business, Dignity has cut the price of its so called \u201csimple\u201d funeral by 25% to \u00a31,995 in England and Wales and \u00a31,695 in Scotland. It has also frozen the price of its more expensive full-service funerals \u2013 which account for 60% of its business \u2013 at \u00a33,800. The simple option includes a basic coffin whereas the more expensive plan includes the option to upgrade the casket, limousine hire and access to the chapel of rest outside normal office hours. McCollum said the simple funeral package had not been altered: \u201cIt\u2019s a straight price cut.\u201d He said the competition Dignity faced had intensified in price terms and in the number of rivals operating in the market over a period when the UK death rate was declining. There are 6,000 funeral locations in the UK today compared with 4,500 when the company listed on the stock exchange in 2004. McCollum said: \u201cThe funeral business is completely unregulated \u2026 anyone can be a funeral director. From an industry point of view the costs are fixed. \u201cOur staff need to be on call 24 hours a day and as deaths decline the cost per funeral has gone up, which has subsequently led to an increase in funeral prices.\u201d The severe share price reaction reflected analysts\u2019 predictions that the company\u2019s profits would almost halve to \u00a341.2m in 2018. Dignity shares closed down 49% at 975p; in 2016 they were changing hands for \u00a328.71. The funeral services business faces a new threat as more families opt for cheaper direct cremations, where the deceased is collected from the place of death and taken directly to the crematorium. The ashes are then returned to the bereaved, with no funeral service. There has been a growing awareness of this no-fuss route after celebrities including David Bowie, Prince and the novelist Anita Brookner had direct cremations. \u201cPeople don\u2019t like funerals, they find them depressing,\u201d said Catherine Powell, the customer experience director at Pure Cremation. \u201cIt offers a way of separating the cremation from the funeral and gives people the freedom to celebrate that person\u2019s life when and how they choose.\u201d Dignity, which operates 44 crematoria, started offering its version of the service in late 2016. At \u00a31,495, it is a cheaper option for families. The cheapest option now available costs \u00a31,095 but does not include the return of the ashes to the family. However McCollum said the direct cremations business was \u201csmall beer\u201d. The company said initial reported deaths for 2017 were 590,000 in Britain, and the group conducted 68,800 funerals, compared with 70,700 the previous year. It noted that the Office for National Statistics anticipated approximately 580,000 deaths in 2018. \u2022 This article was amended on 9 February 2018 to clarify the pricing of the direct cremations offered by Dignity. The figures for reported deaths was for Britain, not the UK as we had it in an earlier version.",

      "bodyText": "The annual meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos is attended by thousands of high-powered delegates from the worlds of politics, business and even entertainment. Here are 10 of the most high-profile figures appearing at the Swiss resort next month. Donald Trump Davos encapsulates nearly everything that the US president loves to hate, and the feeling is mutual. So, the first visit by a US president in 18 years could be an uncomfortable experience for all concerned. Trump may use his speech on Friday to push his \u201cAmerica First\u201d agenda, and savage core WEF beliefs such as free trade and globalisation. Narendra Modi The first Indian prime minister to address Davos in two decades, Modi will urge international businesses to invest in his country. He will deliver the opening speech on Tuesday morning, after hosting a group of CEOs at a dinner on Monday night. His message: India is an open economy, looking for global investments. Theresa May The British prime minister will deliver a special address on Thursday afternoon, a chance to bang the drum for Britain after Brexit. She will also meet other world leaders behind the scenes, but this may not include Trump, who has reportedly snubbed British attempts to schedule a meeting. Cate Blanchett No stranger to prizes, Blanchett will soon have a WEF crystal award to display alongside her two Oscars. The Australian actor is being recognised for raising awareness of the global refugee crisis. She will tell delegates that the world must stand in solidarity with the 65 million people forcibly displaced across the globe. Emmanuel Macron France\u2019s new president will be a big draw. He is a WEF favourite, having beaten populist Marine Le Pen to the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace last spring. Macron gives a special address on Wednesday evening, a chance to push his vision of a successful European Union based on closer integration, economic reforms and free trade. Emmerson Mnangagwa Zimbabwe\u2019s new leader is making a trip to Davos two months after succeeding Robert Mugabe. Mnangagwa hopes to mend Zimbabwe\u2019s difficult relations with the west, and show it is open for business. Winnie Byanyima The executive director of Oxfam has a well-earned reputation for harrying the rich and famous at Davos to mend their ways. This year she will be speaking on income inequality, and the battle against sexual harassment and abuse. She will also push for a renewed fight against tax avoidance, in the light of the Paradise Papers revelations. Al Gore The last three years have been the hottest on record, Swiss glaciers are melting, and the world is on track to miss its Paris climate agreement targets. So the former US vice-president will be racing around Davos warning world leaders to step up the fight against climate change. He will also screen his new documentary, An Inconvenient Sequel: Truth to Power. Sharan Burrow For the first time in its 48-year history, Davos will be chaired by an all-female team \u2013 including Burrow, the general secretary of the International Trade Union Confederation. She will use the platform to challenge \u201cDavos man\u201d on gender equality. As she told CNBC: \u201cIf you ask me whether this rise of the alpha leader has created a wave of misogyny, you know my answer is yes.\u201d Malala Yousafzai Five years after being shot by the Taliban, Yousafzai is taking her campaign for educational equality to Davos. The Oxford politics student, and youngest Nobel peace prize laureate, will tell world leaders to ensure equal access to education for girls and boys. She is appearing on a panel alongside the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau. \u2022 Sign up to the daily Business Today email here or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk.",

So, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/09/donald-trump-attend-davos-despite-criticizing-forum-during-his-campaign\">the first visit by a US president in 18 years</a> could be an uncomfortable experience for all concerned. Trump may use his speech on Friday to push his \u201cAmerica First\u201d agenda, and savage core WEF beliefs such as free trade and globalisation.</p> \n<h2><strong>Narendra Modi</strong></h2> \n<p>The first Indian prime minister to address Davos in two decades, Modi will urge international businesses to invest in his country. He will deliver the opening speech on Tuesday morning, after hosting a group of CEOs at a dinner on Monday night. His message: India is an open economy, looking for global investments.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"15f62ce719903aad20df1e34bcdc81714ebebf28\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/15f62ce719903aad20df1e34bcdc81714ebebf28/0_0_3170_2118/1000.jpg\" alt=\"India\u2019s PM Narendra Modi will deliver the opening speech in Davos\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">India\u2019s PM Narendra Modi will deliver the opening speech in Davos.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Danish Siddiqui/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>Theresa May</strong></h2> \n<p>The British prime minister will deliver a special address on Thursday afternoon, a chance to bang the drum for Britain after Brexit. She will also meet other world leaders behind the scenes, but this may not include Trump, who has reportedly snubbed British attempts to schedule a meeting.</p> \n<h2><strong>Cate Blanchett</strong></h2> \n<p>No stranger to prizes, Blanchett will soon have a WEF crystal award to display alongside her two Oscars. The Australian actor is being<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/01/meet-the-2018-crystal-awardees/\"> </a>recognised for <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/01/meet-the-2018-crystal-awardees/\">raising awareness</a> of the global refugee crisis.

      "bodyText": "Last weekend the vicar of Freie Evangelische Gemeinde, the \u201cEnglish church\u201d in the centre of the Swiss town of Davos was handing out the sacrament. This Sunday holy communion is cancelled, because the church is one of more than a dozen Davos buildings that have been rented out to multinational companies for hundreds of thousands of Swiss francs during the World Economic Forum, the annual business \u201cfestival\u201d which starts next week. As more than 70 world leaders \u2013 including President Donald Trump, Theresa May and French President Emmanuel Macron \u2013 prepare to fly to Davos, the locals are packing up and leaving town. In recent days, 20 Swiss workers have shifted the pulpit and built a stage. Danish online payments firm Tradeshift has transformed the church into \u201cthe sanctuary\u201d \u2013 a place for world leaders, business executives and celebrities to \u201cdebate the biggest challenges and opportunities\u201d. The company is tight-lipped about who will take to the stage, but last year speakers included will.i.am, Matt Damon and Forest Whitaker. Christian Lanng, Tradeshift\u2019s co-founder and chief executive, said the conference would benefit from \u201cthe quality of conversations that happen throughout four days in a tiny mountain village with global leaders and innovators. \u201cI\u2019ve connected with brilliant minds as diverse as [Alibaba founder] Jack Ma, Kofi Anan, Richard Branson and Matt Damon from every industry and nation, and look forward to doing so again this year,\u201d he said. Next door to the church, removal men are moving chairs and driers from the der Fris\u00f6r hairdressing salon. Hub Culture, a social network and digital currency firm, has rented the salon for the last eight years and converted it into an event space complete with a temporary \u201cIce House\u201d structure on its roof. \u201cWe were the first to take over a building in Davos for WEF, but now loads of companies take over shops, the library even the church for the week,\u201d said Stan Stalnaker, the founder of Hub Culture. He has brought a team of 35 people to run his events, including five chefs trained by Michelin-starred chef Alain Ducasse. \u201cWe will be holding events from 7am to midnight every night,\u201d he said. How much this will all cost? \u201cAn awful lot,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not about the money. It\u2019s about what we plan and hope to achieve here \u2013 to help change the world.\u201d So many businesses are moving out of Davos that traffic stewards are required to move on delivery trucks and help pedestrians negotiate construction sites. Lingerie store Blue Lemon is empty bar a few naked mannequins. Salesforce, a Californian cloud computing company, is moving in to host events. An outdoor clothing store is being transformed into an office for management consultancy Accenture, a shoe shop is being used for HSBC events, and a knitting store will be used to promote India. Pizza joint and night club Remix will become \u201cCrypto HQ\u201d a venue promising \u201cimmersive talks, panels and engaging workshops with the world\u2019s most cutting-edge thought leaders and innovators\u201d. One of the few shops not taking the cash and moving out next week is Stauble, the local purveyor of Rolex and Patek Phillippe watches. Manager Isabel Steinmann said she was \u201cliving in hope\u201d of big spenders from the conference suddenly needing a new timepiece, or two. \u201cOur watches are just the type that WEF people would like, we stay hoping they will pop in.\u201d A team of 11 men from Coventry are turning Guyan &amp; Co estate agent into an event space for Wipro, an Indian IT company. \u201cIt\u2019s more interesting to be working here than building a stand in the NEC [exhibition centre in Birmingham], But boy is it expensive, our bar bill last night was \u20ac300 (\u00a3265) and we only had four beers,\u201d Barry Buxton of events production company Freeman, said. Freeman\u2019s foreman Rich Strutt said Wipro had spent a \u201cfrightening amount\u201d on hiring the store and fitting it out. \u201cThe rent for here is SFr320,000 (\u00a3240,000), the rent for our apartments is \u00a334,000 for 10 days \u2013 they are not luxury and we\u2019re two to a room,\u201d he said. \u201cAll in, it will cost [Wipro] more than \u00a31m \u2013 they are happy to spend a lot.\u201d Strutt said there was a lot of media attention on Davos, but he questioned its purpose. \u201cIt seems like just a good excuse for a lot of rich people to hang out and drink champagne. Bill Gates will be here talking about climate change having flown here in a private jet.\u201d Adam Twidell, chief executive of private jet booking service PrivateFly, said he expected there to be more than 1,700 private jet flights into or out of nearby airports \u2013 the highest number ever. A flight to Zurich from London costs about \u00a310,500, and a 40-minute helicopter ride to Davos costs another \u00a33,750. Facebook has gone one step further than rent a storefront, and built its own three-storey house to hold events hosted by founder Mark Zuckerberg. Facebook is renting the land from the Kirchner Museum. Dolores Mark, the museum\u2019s spokesperson, declined to say how much Facebook had paid, only that it was \u201ca lot\u201d. While the WEF event brings in \u20ac40m to the local economy, some residents complain that the growing size of the event is putting too much strain on resources. Reto Branschi, chief executive of tourism body Destination Davos, said: \u201cIt is difficult to have all the construction work, but on the other hand WEF gives us a huge media presence and economic impact. More than 80% of residents voted in favour of having the WEF in a poll last year.\u201d There is not a single available hotel room left in town, despite prices of up to five figures a night for rooms that cost a little more than \u20ac100 last week. Many locals have rented out their chalets and apartments for thousands. Trump\u2019s late decision to attend has prompted extra problems: \u201cThe US delegation rang this morning asking for more rooms,\u201d said Tina Heide, general manager of the Grandhotel Belvedere, the fanciest hotel in Davos. \u201cThey\u2019ll be lucky to find anything \u2026 They might be able to rent trailers in the car park.\u201d The hotel will be patrolled by some of the more than 5,000 Swiss troops drafted in to secure the town next week. \u201cSecurity is paramount,\u201d she said. \u201cBut so is our guests\u2019 comfort.\u201d To that end, the hotel has drafted in 200 extra chambermaids, waiters and cocktail waitresses who will have to share rooms. More than a dozen heads of state will be staying at the hotel, together with \u201ca lot of celebrities and other VVIPs,\u201d she said. The WEF has block-booked the hotel, allocating rooms and informing the hotel who is staying on a daily basis to ensure maximum security. \u201cHeads of state can be staying in a suite or a regular single room. They don\u2019t care as long as they get to stay here, as it is close to everything.\u201d \u2022 Sign up to the daily Business Today email here or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk.",

Bill Gates will be here talking about climate change having flown here in a private jet.\u201d</p> \n<p>Adam Twidell, chief executive of private jet booking service PrivateFly, said he expected there to be more than 1,700 private jet flights into or out of nearby airports \u2013 the highest number ever.

Ministers set a target of the end of 2020 for every home to be offered one of the meters, which automate readings and display real-time energy use in pounds and pence. So far 8.6m first generation, or SMETS1, meters have been installed. This year is meant to herald the first big push to roll out more advanced SMETS2 meters, which do not have the interoperability problems of the older ones. But in a private letter to energy companies on Thursday, the government said systems designed to handle the newer meters were not ready, and so it was moving back a cutoff date for the older model by three months. The reputation of smart metering could be harmed if problems with the meters were not ironed out, an energy official warned. The extension moves the deadline from July to October and will lead to hundreds of thousands of people receiving the older devices, which can lose their ability to send readings after consumers switch supplier. Smart meters were installed at an average rate of 363,000 per month for the first nine months of 2017, suggesting at least 1.08m extra will be installed as a result of the extension. The actual figure is likely to be higher as the installation rate is accelerating. Bulb, the energy supplier, projects up to 1.7m SMETS1 will be fitted because of the rule change. The older meters\u2019 interoperability problems are expected, but not guaranteed, to be fixed by October. The government announced in December that in some circumstances energy suppliers could be permitted to install the first generation meters for a further six months, meaning they could still be going into homes until spring 2019. Hayden Wood, the co-founder of Bulb, which will use only SMETS2 models, said: \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing that ministers are letting energy companies continue to install inferior, first generation smart meters for another three months.\u201d Neither the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, nor Smart Energy GB, the body set up to promote smart meters, have been able to tell the Guardian how many SMETS2 meters have been installed.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "British shoppers sharply reined in spending over the Christmas period, as Black Friday deals encouraged them to purchase presents earlier, rounding off the weakest year for retail sales growth since 2013. According to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), spending fell by 1.5% in December after a strong November when the US-inspired discounting event appeared to boost sales. The drop was worse than expected among City economists and is likely to have dented profits for many British retailers over the key shopping month. Rhian Murphy, senior statistician at the ONS, said there had been an increase in sales over the final three months of the year as a whole, but December had been weaker as consumers pulled forward their shopping to take advantage of Black Friday deals the previous month, mirroring a trend seen in previous years. In 2017 as a whole, the quantity of products bought in retail sales increased by 1.9% \u2013 the lowest annual growth since 2013. \u201cHowever, the longer-term picture is one of slowing growth, with increased prices squeezing people\u2019s spending,\u201d Murphy said. British households have come under intense pressure from weak wage growth and rising inflation, after the sudden drop in sterling following the Brexit vote pushed up the cost of importing food and fuel to the UK. Growth in consumer spending has slowed as a consequence, denting the strength of the economy. The latest ONS figures show monthly declines in both the value and quantity of goods sold across all major retail sectors, apart from a slight increase in the value of items sold at petrol stations. Shoppers are also increasingly heading online, hurting shops on the high street, with the internet accounting for almost a fifth of all spending in Britain last month. Compared with December a year ago, there was a 1.4% increase in the amount bought by consumers overall. However, sales of food fell by 0.2% compared with Christmas 2016, which statisticians said was probably owing to rising prices in the shops. But the drop in sales from November to December \u2013 which was the biggest monthly fall since June 2016 \u2013 rounded off a difficult year on the high street. Consumers first started to pull forward their Christmas spending from December to November three years ago, when Black Friday began to gain significant traction in Britain. Amazon is credited with bringing the US Thanksgiving holiday sales event to the UK. The heavy discounting is, however, likely to have hit British retailers\u2019 profits, as well as being a likely factor behind lower revenues on Boxing Day, when the traditional post-Christmas sales period begins, according to Keith Richardson of Lloyds Bank. \u201cIt really was a blue Christmas for retailers, especially on the high street,\u201d he said. \u201cThe supermarkets managed to keep the tills ringing with sales of mince pies, prosecco and craft gins, but even this wasn\u2019t enough to hide the fact that non-food suffered a sluggish month.\u201d The weak official retail sales figures follow a string of downbeat trading updates from high street chains after a torrid Christmas, kicked off by Debenhams issuing a profit warning in the first week of January. Other retail stalwarts including Marks &amp; Spencer and House of Fraser reported disappointing Christmas figures. The clothing chain Bonmarch\u00e9 added to the gloom on Friday by reporting falling sales, prompting its share price to drop by more than 20%, while Carpetright shares plunged more than 40% after a profit warning. Economists said the pressure on consumers was likely to lessen somewhat this year, as the effect of the pound\u2019s sudden fall after the Brexit vote began to fade. Inflation eased for the first time in six months in December and is expected to fall further over the coming months.",

      "bodyText": "Ryanair has been referred to employment and tax authorities for investigation by two parliamentary committees, citing the airline\u2019s \u201crefusal to cooperate\u201d with inquiries over crew pay and conditions. Frank Field, chair of the work and pensions committee, and Rachel Reeves, chair of the business select committee, have written to HMRC and the director of labour market enforcement asking them to investigate Ryanair and the agencies that supply its cabin crew. Late last year, Ryanair declined to answer further questions about pay and employment practices, after an initial response failed to satisfy MPs. The committees sought more information after reports that cabin crew were required to work for free, pay for training and uniforms and take significant periods of unpaid leave, which suggested that agency workers were receiving less than the living wage. A letter from Ryanair\u2019s HR director, sent on 21 December, said crew earned between \u20ac24,000 [\u00a321,150] and \u20ac40,000 [\u00a335,250] a year, double the legal minimum for the work carried out. However, MPs said that the letter ignored many of their questions while the pay figures did not tally with a contract they had seen. Field and Reeves have told HMRC and Sir David Metcalf, the government\u2019s director of labour market enforcement, that despite Ryanair\u2019s assurances, it appeared that cabin crew were being paid in a confusing and opaque way, that could mask low pay and poor conditions. They wrote: \u201cWe believe it is vital that potential poor employment practices are examined not only to ensure the rights of Ryanair cabin crew are protected, but also to ensure that there is no \u2018race to the bottom\u2019 across the aviation sector.\u201d Field said: \u201cWe and the public can draw our own conclusions about Ryanair\u2019s comprehensive failure to answer allegations on its pay and employment practices.\u201d They had requested that HMRC extend its current investigation into Ryanair pilots to look at cabin crew, he said. Reeves said she hoped that HMRC would look at the airline\u2019s practices as a matter of urgency. \u201cRyanair might want to dodge our committees\u2019 questions and hide behind excuses, but the UK is the largest provider of workers to the company and we must be sure that everyone working for Ryanair is receiving fair pay and reasonable working conditions.\u201d A spokeswoman for the airline said: \u201cRyanair has already confirmed to this committee that its pilots earn between \u20ac130,000 [\u00a3114,550] and \u20ac180,000 [\u00a3158,600] per annum and our cabin crew between \u20ac24,000 and \u20ac40,000, which is more than double UK national minimum wage, and since we also comply fully with UK employment law, we have no further comment in response to this committee\u2019s inaccurate press releases.\u201d Earlier, the airline said that pilots across its 15 UK bases had voted to accept pay increases of up to 20%, while talks continued with British pilot union Balpa over recognition. Talks with Irish unions are also continuing, after the airline announced last month it would reverse previous policy and recognise unions. \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",
