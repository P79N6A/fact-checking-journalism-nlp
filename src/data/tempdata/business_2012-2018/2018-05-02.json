      "bodyText": "TalkTalk and Vodafone have been named as the UK\u2019s worst broadband and mobile providers respectively for customer service. Ofcom, the media and broadcasting regulator, has listed the broadband, landline and mobile phone providers as having the worst customer service records, based on a comprehensive survey. The study, which looked at customer satisfaction, complaints and call-waiting times, found that TalkTalk\u2019s broadband customers received the worst treatment of any provider. TalkTalk may have had the second quickest call-waiting time \u2013 at an average of 52 seconds compared to EE, which topped out at 48 seconds \u2013 but only four in 10 of those surveyed said they were satisfied with how their complaint had been handled. A breakdown of the nine metrics Ofcom looked at to determine how well a broadband provider performed showed that TalkTalk to be the worst performing in all of the factors, from willingness to help resolve a problem to courtesy and politeness of advisers. In the broadband customer service list, (ascending in quality), TalkTalk was followed by BT and its subsidiary EE in joint second; Sky and Virgin Media were joint third, and the BT-owned Plusnet ranked best. TalkTalk also rated worst for customer service relating to issues from home owners who had their landline with the company. \u201cIn the case of TalkTalk, which scores poorly in terms of a range of customer service measures, there\u2019s a feeling that the provider has struggled to redress its public image since the high-profile data breach of 2015,\u201d said Ewan Taylor-Gibson, telecoms expert at the price comparison site uSwitch.com. For mobile services, the level of satisfaction with providers was generally high, with an overall 91% satisfaction rate and an average of only 4% of customers finding a reason to complain. However, Virgin Mobile and Vodafone fared the worst in this aspect. The survey found that Ofcom received more complaints per 100,000 mobile users (48) against Vodafone than any about other provider. Overall, Virgin Mobile customers were least happy with the service they received, with less than half saying they were satisfied with the way their complaints were handled. \u201cBroadband and mobile are now essential services for many of us,\u201d Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said. \u201cConsumers deserve services that meet the demands of modern life, yet these new figures show that not all providers are delivering. Citizens Advice research also reveals that loyal customers face higher prices in the telecoms market.\u201d Among mobile companies, Tesco Mobile and Giffgaff, which is owned by O2\u2019s parent company Telef\u00f3nica, topped the table with customers most likely to recommend the providers to a friend. \u201cPeople often focus on price when they\u2019re choosing a phone or broadband provider,\u201d said Lindsey Fussell, consumer group director at Ofcom. \u201cBut there are big differences in the customer service offered by providers. We are encouraging people to look beyond the price and consider customer service, too. In such a competitive market companies simply can\u2019t afford to let their service standards slip. If they don\u2019t up their game, customers can vote with their feet.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Paul Pester, the chief executive of TSB, had three main tasks to perform at the Treasury select committee hearing on Wednesday. First, apologise with maximum contrition for the IT shambles and the hassle caused to customers. Second, declare that he definitely won\u2019t be getting any form of bonus this year. Third, say when the problem will be fixed. He failed on all three fronts. The formal apologies flowed (every chief executive knows the drill) but they were undercut by Pester\u2019s combative assertions that much of TSB\u2019s new IT system is working splendidly. The \u201cunderlying engine\u201d is doing its job, he argued, but there were still \u201caccessibility\u201d issues \u2013 a bit like a shop being too small for all the customers who want to get in, he suggested. Since he was the executive ultimately responsible for commissioning the size of the shop, this explanation fell flat. When 40,000 customers have complained in 10 days, accessibility is the problem. The bonus issue should have been an open goal since even Pester, surely, can\u2019t be expecting to collect more than his \u00a3900,000 basic salary this year. But, no, the TSB chairman, Richard Meddings, said Pester had agreed not to take any bonus \u201cfor this integration\u201d, which left open the possibility that he could receive awards for other supposed achievements. This may not be a comfort to those overworked TSB staff struggling to handle the volume of complaints, or the complainants left hanging on the phone lines. As for when TSB will get control of the situation, nobody would offer a hostage to fortune. Once Pester had conceded there is still a problem that needs to be fixed, he wouldn\u2019t set a date \u2013 although he inevitably wanted to lever in a reference to \u201cimprovements\u201d arriving all the time. Only Miquel Montes, appearing for TSB\u2019s Spanish parent, Banco Sabadell, agreed with a reference to \u201cdays\u201d \u2013 but it sounded a long way from being a guarantee. Meddings, at least, seemed to grasp the grasp the seriousness of the TSB\u2019s situation (perhaps because he saw a few crises during his executive days at Standard Chartered) but whether the postmortem by the law firm Slaughter and May will get to the heart of events is anybody\u2019s guess. The true state of relations between TSB and its Spanish parent, and how much blame should fall on each party, is a crucial issue that was barely explored in the session. Instead, the lasting impression was of prickly Pester hitting a series of wrong notes. By the end, he was on to his favourite subject of how TSB will rise as a mighty challenger to the \u201cbig five\u201d banks who enjoy too many privileges. Nicky Morgan, chair of the committee, had to remind him that, if you really want to challenge, start by running a reliable and robust operation. Quite. Bookmakers have little to moan about Damned bookmakers, they\u2019re never happy. Their marketing departments never miss an opportunity to make exaggerated claims about being cleaned out when too many heavily backed favourites romp home at Cheltenham. Now they\u2019re moaning about too many favourites losing \u2013 or, more specifically, Arsenal failing so often. A \u201csustained period of bookmaker-friendly results\u201d, says Paddy Power Betfair, contributed to a soft first quarter. When Ars\u00e8ne Wenger\u2019s heavily backed team got into the losing habit away from home, punters went into hibernation, apparently. There was \u201can adverse recycling impact\u201d, meaning fewer people had winnings to blow on the next match. From the point of view of the bookmaker, this does not sound like the worst problem to have. The customers were still separated from their money, just more quickly than usual. Paddy Power, note, reckons it has still enough spare cash to spend \u00a3500m on buying back its own shares. It will live. Let it go, Mike Sports Direct is out of the headlines but the founder and chief executive, Mike Ashley, seems determined to get it back in. He\u2019s grumbling about Iain Wright, the former chair of the business select committee that investigated working conditions at Sports Direct. Let it go, Mike: the inquiry happened two years ago, and if you didn\u2019t want MPs turning up unannounced at your Shirebrook warehouse, you shouldn\u2019t have said that they were \u201c100%\u201d free to do so. Wright isn\u2019t even an MP these days, making Ashley\u2019s stance doubly bizarre.",

      "bodyText": "Mike Ashley, the billionaire founder of Sports Direct, has resurrected the controversy over working conditions at his company\u2019s Shirebrook warehouse by filing a complaint against the former MP who led the parliamentary inquiry into the retailer. The company has complained to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards about the conduct of Iain Wright, the former Labour MP for Hartlepool, who chaired the business, innovation and skills select committee during the last parliament. The 2016 inquiry into working practices at the firm was launched after a Guardian undercover investigation exposed how the company was paying staff less than the legal minimum wage. The MPs concluded that Ashley had been running Sports Direct like a \u201cVictorian workhouse\u201d, building his success on a business model that treats workers \u201cwithout dignity or respect\u201d. Sports Direct and its employment agencies - Transline and The Best Connection - were subsequently named and shamed by the government for paying workers less than the legal minimum wage. The three companies also agreed to award the company\u2019s warehouse workers around \u00a31m in back pay. In the latest development, Sports Direct has complained that Wright, who stepped down as an MP before the last election, failed to act objectively during the select committee inquiry by not fully explaining a donation he received from the Unite trade union, which supplied evidence to the investigation. The retailer also says that Wright misled the company about when the committee would carry out an unannounced inspection of Shirebrook. The visit, in November 2016, ended in further controversy amid claims Sports Direct staff had placed a covert recording device in a room where the MPs were meeting. The transcript of the parliamentary hearing records Wright as opening proceedings by declaring his receipt of a donation from Unite. Later, when Wright asked Ashley if his committee could show up uninvited to inspect the group\u2019s controversial Shirebrook warehouse, Ashley replied: \u201c100%, 24/7\u201d. Wright, a former accountant who now works for the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW), added: \u201cI\u2019m more than happy that he is flagging up what I think was a really good piece of work. My colleagues, who were cross party, worked well together to highlight a list of appalling practices. This is obviously still eating him up and he can\u2019t let it go\u201d. Kathryn Stone, the parliamentary commissioner for standards, now has to determine whether the complaint is within her remit, and whether the evidence justifies an investigation. If she feels Sports Direct\u2019s complaint has cleared those first two hurdles, the rules state that as the complaint is about a former MP, Stone must then also consult the committee on standards, which oversees her work and is staffed by MPs and members of the public.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The chief executive of TSB will forfeit a \u00a32m bonus payment in the light of an IT failure that left thousands of customers locked out of their accounts, as MPs accused the bank boss of being \u201cextraordinarily complacent\u201d. During a bruising evidence session before the Treasury select committee, TSB chief executive Paul Pester and the bank\u2019s chairman, Richard Meddings, said they had received 40,000 complaints about the outage but did not know exactly how many of the bank\u2019s 1.9 million online customers had been affected. Meddings told MPs that Pester had volunteered to give up a \u00a32m bonus associated with the migration to a new IT system, hinting that other executives could also have their bonuses slashed. But Pester could still receive up to \u00a31.3m in other bonuses for 2018, on top of a further \u00a31.3m in basic pay, benefits and pension contributions. Pester declined to predict when the problems, which have been affecting customers for 10 days, would be fixed. The committee chair, Nicky Morgan, accused Pester of being \u201cextraordinarily complacent\u201d after he said the bank\u2019s move to a new IT system, which triggered the problems, had mostly run smoothly. \u201cWhat we are hearing this afternoon is the most staggering example of a chief executive who seems unwilling to realise the scale of the problem that is being faced,\u201d she said. Pester insisted that 95% of customers were now able to log in to the bank\u2019s mobile app and website without problems. However, MPs on the committee read out a series of emails and tweets from customers that indicated ongoing chaos. One customer said they had spent 14 hours on the phone to customer services, while another said they had been left unable to pay their gas and electricity bills and a third said they risked a house purchase falling through because they could not access bank statements. Morgan questioned the notion that the IT problems were mostly fixed, saying customers had been put in an \u201cimpossible financial situation\u201d. Simon Clarke MP said Pester\u2019s belief that most customers were now banking without problems could not be true unless there was a \u201cmass conspiracy by members of the public\u201d. Morgan added that two Treasury committee staff members had found they could not log in during the evidence session, drawing an unexpected reply from Pester. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to know we have so many customers in the room,\u201d he said. \u201cThank you very much for using TSB.\u201d He said he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d that some customers, who he admitted were being made to wait 30 minutes for their phone calls to be answered, were hanging up in frustration. TSB has marketed itself in large part on its ability to provide better customer service than larger high street lending rivals. However, customers began experiencing problems with their accounts on Monday 23 April after the bank \u2013 now owned by Spanish lender Sabadell \u2013 migrated from an IT system inherited from the previous owner, Lloyds Banking Group. Sabadell had hoped to make more than \u00a3100m in annual savings by using the new system, known as Proteo in apparent reference to Proteus, a Greek god of the sea often associated with change. Pester insisted the switch to the new system had been rigorously tested beforehand and was \u201crunning smoothly\u201d for the most part but that it was struggling to deal with high levels of demand. \u201cIt\u2019s the equivalent of having a shop that\u2019s too small to let the number of customers in,\u201d he said. He said around 50% of customers had experienced problems with their accounts on the first day of using the new system, with 40,000 complaining, compared to an average of around 3,000 during a typical 10-day period. Pester said around 22,500 have had their problem \u201cacknowledged\u201d by the banks so far. Morgan referred to a comment made by the bank\u2019s chief information officer in December 2017, who said the switch to Proteo would make TSB \u201ca digital business that just happens to be a bank\u201d. She said TSB \u201cis neither a digital business, nor a bank. In fact it\u2019s a broken bank.\u201d Pester and Meddings said customers would receive compensation from TSB, not only for any financial loss but also for emotional distress and inconvenience, adding that no customer would be left \u201cout of pocket\u201d. \u201cWe apologise profusely for the issues we\u2019ve caused our customers,\u201d Pester said, adding that it had been a \u201cterrible decision\u201d to go ahead with the switch to a new IT platform. But he said that TSB was needed to challenge the so-called Big Five high street banks and provide greater competition. The accountancy firm Deloitte is advising on the bank\u2019s compensation strategy, while TSB has recruited IBM to fix the IT problem and the City law firm Slaughter and May to investigate the cause.",

      "bodyText": "My father, Louis Calvete, who has died aged 94, worked for the chemical company ICI for 35 years. He joined its plastics division in Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire, in 1946 as an industrial chemist in the research department, where he worked on high-pressure polymerisation, including the development of glue for adhesive labels. Louis created new dyes to produce coloured perspex, which was becoming extensively used during the 1950s and 60s. He later moved into management services, where he used his knowledge of statistics to establish the new computer programming systems, and then finally to overseas sales, with responsibility for Central and South America and West Africa. Louis was born during a storm, at University College hospital, London, to Basque parents, Ramos (nee Ruiz de Galaretta) and Isidoro Calvete, and was proud of his heritage. He attended Wimbledon Park school and Emanuel school in south-west London, then Kimbolton school in Cambridgeshire. He spent the second world war years in Ecuador. His father, a pacifist and anarchist, having been influenced by his personal experience of wartorn Spain and France, decided to sell his business, which manufactured hairdressing equipment, and emigrate. The Basque government in exile in London were hoping to rehouse Basques in Ecuador and Isidoro took on the role of organising this. During Louis\u2019 time in Ecuador he worked at a pharmacy and at the British Legation as a bilingual assistant to the press secretary. On returning to postwar Britain in 1946, Louis secured work at ICI and also resumed his studies, which had been cut short when the family left for Ecuador, gaining a bachelors\u2019 degree in chemistry through part-time study at the University of London. Following his early retirement from ICI in 1980, he made full use of his language skills by working as a London Blue Badge guide, a Saga tour guide and a technical translator. He then had the opportunity to pursue his interest in walking and completed the Pennine Way, the Ridgeway and Offa\u2019s Dyke. He did not confine his interests to the sciences \u2013 his appreciation of the arts included most genres of classical music and art. He was also a huge fan of the Goons and a lifelong vegetarian. In 2006 he published Permanent Waving, The Golden Years, an account of his father\u2019s involvement in the hairdressing business during the interwar years. His wife of 60 years, Roslyn (nee Rix), died in 2016; he is survived by two daughters, Joanne and me, and two grandsons.",

      "bodyText": "House of Fraser is to close stores, potentially putting hundreds of jobs at risk, in a restructuring deal that will give control of the retail chain to the Chinese owner of Hamleys. C.banner is buying a 51% stake in the parent group of the ailing department store group. The buyout will involve the acquisition of shares from Nanjing Cenbest, part of China\u2019s Sanpower conglomerate, which will retain a minority stake. C.banner has also agreed to pay a further \u00a370m for new shares leading to a \u201csignificant capital injection\u201d in House of Fraser. That comes on top of \u00a325m of cash pumped into the company by shareholders since March this year. The deal is subject to House of Fraser closing an unknown number of its 59 stores and renegotiating rents with landlords through a company voluntary arrangement (CVA) insolvency process , which is expected to be launched in June. Industry experts suggested House of Fraser would have to consider closing at least 20 sites. The group has already been negotiating with landlords as part of plans to reduce its floorspace by 30% by slimming down a number of outlets. It is understood that deals have been struck to downsize stores in cities including Plymouth and Wolverhampton. The closures could lead to hundreds of job losses at the 169-year-old department store chain, which employs 5,000 people directly and a further 12,500 people in concessions for fashion brands including French Connection, Phase Eight and Ted Baker. The loss of such large retail tenants will also be a major blow to high streets reeling from the collapse of Toys R Us and Maplin, and the closures of 60 New Look stores under a rescue restructuring. Carpetright plans to shut 92 stores and Mothercare is expected to close dozens of outlets as it battles for survival. The switch towards online shopping is hitting all retailers but department stores are finding it particularly hard to adapt because there are few alternative tenants for their large stores, most of which are tied into long-lease agreements. In the US, hundreds of department stores closed last year, while in the UK BHS collapsed in 2016 after years of difficulties. Debenhams has closed two stores and announced plans to close up to eight more. It is also looking to find new uses for redundant space such as gyms, restaurants and hot desk offices. \u201cA CVA for House of Fraser has seemed inevitable for some time as the migration to online sales leads to a number of stores becoming unprofitable,\u201d Patrick O\u2019Brien, an analyst at GlobalData, said. \u201cIf it can get more realistic rents and get rid of weaker stores, and with investment in own ranges and the store environment it has every chance of a viable future.\u201d House of Fraser said the restructuring would \u201cprovide the business with an effective platform for future growth\u201d. Under the deal, Sanpower and C.banner will co-own the holding company that controls an 89% stake in House of Fraser\u2019s UK business. The Sports Direct boss, Mike Ashley, controls the other 11%. The investment in House of Fraser is a major step up in investment in the UK for the Hong Kong-listed C.banner, whose chairman, Chen Yixi, is the brother-in-law of Yuan Yafei, the billionaire chairman of Sanpower. C.banner, which specialises in women\u2019s footwear under brands including MIO and Sundance, bought Hamleys in 2015 for an estimated \u00a3100m. Frank Slevin, the House of Fraser chairman, said C.banner\u2019s investment was \u201ca vote of confidence in our prospects\u201d. Slevin said the management team led by Alex Williamson had made \u201csubstantial progress\u201d on a turnaround but added: \u201cWe need to go further and faster if we are to confront the seismic shifts in the retail industry. There is a need to create a leaner business that better serves the rapidly changing behaviours of a customer base which increasingly shops channel agnostically.\u201d However, House of Fraser faces a potentially rocky ride in finalising its restructuring plans, according to the British Property Federation. Ian Fletcher, director of real estate policy, said discussions with landlords were likely to be \u201cawkward and any support for the CVA given grudgingly\u201d as the company had not consulted them before going public.",

    "webTitle": "MPs slam TSB boss's complacency over IT fiasco - as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Any ambitious junior bank executives out there should watch that hearing again closely, as an example of how not to handle a select committee. In happier times, Paul Pester would challenge his staff to \u2018beat the boss\u2019 in triathlons. But today, the TSB CEO found himself on the wrong end of a beating from MPs. There\u2019s clearly a massive disconnect between TSB\u2019s view of its IT crisis, and the view which MPs hear from constituents who have been unable to get a decent banking service (or ANY, in some cases) for 12 days and counting. Although Pester did remember to apologise a few times (an essential shield on these occasions), it looked less-than-fully sincere when he then argued that many things were actually running smoothly. The correct response to being told that two of the committee\u2019s own staff can\u2019t log into TSB is NOT to joke about having so many customers. It looks arrogant, when contrition is required. No wonder Nicky Morgan accused Pester of simply not understanding the size of his mess, and the reputational damage to TSB and beyond, saying: What we are hearing this afternoon is the most staggering example of a chief executive who seems unwilling to realise the scale of the problem that is being faced. That could yet be his epitaph, if TSB can\u2019t get systems working properly, fast, and satisfy the 40,000 complaints filed in the last 12 days. Pester also failed to answer some predictable questions. For example: He couldn\u2019t say when the crisis will be over He didn\u2019t know exactly how many small firms have been hit He wouldn\u2019t say how large the compensation bill could be Pester has, finally, had the nous to give up any bonus for this IT migration - but this may be an empty gesture, as the board may well have decided that he\u2019d not earned it anyway. He could still get a bonus for his wider work (although not for today\u2019s performance, I suggest). MPs may have had some sympathy when Pester said how much he regretted the \u201cterrible\u201d decision to press on with the migration. But alas, Doc Brown wasn\u2019t waiting outside Portcullis House with a DeLorean - and with Pester\u2019s recent form, it might have stalled anyway. And on that note, we\u2019re wrapping up for the day. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW A TSB customer, Penny Simpson, isn\u2019t impressed by Pester\u2019s performance: Pester is in another world. He is producing sheets of data that tell him 95% of his customers can log on. WE CANNOT LOG ON and we have not been able to for 11 days. Is he in denial or just telling lies? Please media, help us. He is just telling people to contact him if they have problems. How? You cannot get through on the phone, you cannot log on. Nicky Morgan wraps up the session by telling TSB that the committee expects customers to be properly compensated -- including finding a replacement car for Simon Clarke\u2019s constituent. She also declares that the committee expects to see the full Slaughter and May report into what went wrong. Meddings politely protests, saying the committee can certainly see the key findings, but might not be allowed to see any commercially sensitive information. Morgan says the committee would like to see the full report...and early information on the compensation scheme. And she concludes with a fairly damning assessment of the situation at TSB: At the end of the day, this is a bank for whom many customers feel you are not saying \u201cyes\u201d...but making it as difficult as possible to get hold of the money to pay bills and putting them in an impossible financial situation. That\u2019s the end of the session. Q: With hindsight, would you do the migration again? CEO Paul Pester says he would not! If I had a time machine, I would take myself back to one minute before one o\u2019clock in the afternoon and change the decision. If there was one decision in my life I could change, it\u2019s the decision to go ahead with the migration on 1pm on Sunday afternoon Clearly it was \u201ca terrible decision\u201d for our bank, for our customers, and me personally, Pester explains ruefully. Of course I would change it. Chairman Richard Meddings concurs - but also insists that TSB didn\u2019t have any idea that the migration would go so badly. If it had seen any hint of the problems, it wouldn\u2019t have pressed on. Paul Pester can\u2019t say how many people have left TSB since the crisis began. And the committee\u2019s obvious amazement, Paul Pester thinks TSB can still win new customers in the weeks and months ahead. Nicky Morgan picks her jaw off the floor, and lashes Pester for simply not understanding the impact of this crisis: Do you recognise the reputational damage that this has caused, not just to TSB but to online banking generally? The UK needs TSB to be a challenger to the big five banks, Pester insists. Your customers need TSB to provide a good banking service, Morgan shoots back. Pester tried to pay tribute to TSB\u2019s thousands of hard working staff, saying he\u2019s confidence that his \u2018partners\u2019 can persuade customers to move to TSB in the future. Those partners have been badly let down by senior management, Morgan retorts. Quite. Pester says customers should use TSB\u2019s online complaint form to get in touch, rather than trying to phone or using social media to report problems. Everyone enjoys tweeting, but it is \u2018shouting into the void\u2019, TSB\u2019s CEO adds. Nicky Morgan won\u2019t stand for this, pointing out that TSB\u2019s own Twitter account says people should phone. They can phone if they prefer, Pester replies. After 90 minutes of evidence, Morgan has heard enough - and lays into Pester: What we are hearing this afternoon is the most staggering example of a chief executive who seems unwilling to realise the scale of the problem that is being faced. Saying that social media is \u2018shouting into the void\u2019 doesn\u2019t show much inclination to being a truly digital online presence, she adds firmly. Simon Clarke MP brings up the case of a third constituent, whose business is threatened because he can\u2019t access his banking services. Pester sounds concerned, but he is also insistent that most of TSB\u2019s services are working well. Millions of customers are using their bank cards every day, he says. There\u2019s clearly a disconnect here -- MPs (and the media) are hearing from people in a real fix, but TSB thinks problems are intermittent. Q: What is the quantum of the compensation bill? Pester sways away from this one, playing the \u201cwe\u2019ve been so focused fixing the problems that we haven\u2019t calculated it\u201d card. Conservative Simon Clarke MP now challenges Pester, citing the case of a constituent called Kerry. She has been stuck on telephone lines, paying 50p per minute. She relies on pensions credit, and is at her \u201cwits end\u201d with her gas about to be cut off. Q: who should she contact to resolve this today? Pester apologises to Kerry, and says that TSB wants to deal with complaints. Again, he encourages customers to get in touch with their problems. He also reveals that the bank is using \u2018artificial intelligence\u2019 to find vulnerable customers. (I\u2019m glad to see there\u2019s some intelligence involved in this mess). Clarke then cites another customer - Alison Wickes, who lost a non-returnable deposit on a car because she couldn\u2019t get the money to buy it out of TSB, and the dealer sold it to someone else. More reaction from irate customers.... ...and unimpressed journalists: Q: Has this shambles, or meltdown, put customers at risk of fraud? Based on experience, we know that fraudsters will be following the news, following social media and will take any opportunity to take advantage, Pester replies. That\u2019s why TSB wrote to customers this week warning them to be careful. Q: Will there be any legal action over this mess? Sabadell\u2019s Miquel Montes says not. But....TSB\u2019s chairman is more circumspect. Richard Meddings says it all depends on Slaughter and May\u2019s independent review: Q: When will this shambles be over, asks John Mann Meddings says TSB is seeing \u201cimprovement\u201d on its online services, and across its other channels. But it\u2019s still not good enough\u201d. The wrong thing to do would be to set a date, Meddings claims -- but \u201cwe are working as hard and as fast as we can\u201d. Q: Can you do better, Mr Pester? I can\u2019t give a fixed date, Pester replies. If I give one it\u2019s likely to be unfair to customers, he adds. Q: This week, next week, the week after next? Pester won\u2019t be drawn. Mann turns in exasperation to Sabadell\u2019s COO, Miguel Montes.... We are very close, Montes replies. Q: That sound like days. Could it be days? Hopefully yes, Montes replies cautiously [and not very convincingly, I fear]. John Mann turns to the issue of compensation, and the case of a TSB customer whose wedding planning thanks to the IT chaos. Q: How will TSB make things right? Meddings says TSB don\u2019t simply use a \u2018financial calculation\u2019 when assessing compensation. It will also take stress and inconvenience into account. Deloitte are helping TSB to draw up a framework to help deal with compensation claims, Meddings explains Q: What if customers aren\u2019t satisfied? They could consider appealing to a financial onbudsman, Meddings suggests. Mann turns his guns to chairman Richard Medding about the \u201cshambles\u201d at TSB. The only similar mess I can remember in my time on this committee is the Co-op Bank, says Mann. They lost their chief executive and chairman - are you going to lose yours too? No, Medding replies. Q: What about Mr Pester\u2019s bonuses? Boom! Meddings reveals that Pester has offered to give up the bonus related to the successful migration of the IT system. That\u2019s the right thing to do, Meddings adds. Q: So, no bonus for Mr Pester this year? It\u2019s not as simple as that. A decision over his total pay and bonus package will be taken at the end of the year, once the review into the IT project has been concluded, Meddings explains. Now it\u2019s Labour MP John Mann\u2019s turn. Q: How many SMEs have had problems? Pester doesn\u2019t know (again, not a good look). In percentage terms it\u2019s similar to the wider average (where around 50% of customers couldn\u2019t get online at any one time), he says. Q: How many customers have had problems speaking to your telephone helpline? We\u2019ve been very disappointed with the abandon rate -- Q:...with WHAT?!, Mann interjects. ....These are customers who decide not to wait, Pester explains Q: How long are you making them wait? The average wait time is 30 minutes, Pester says, it hasn\u2019t improved in recent days. [But as MPs realise, this wait time doesn\u2019t customers whose patience hits breaking point and hang up after a lengthy wait] Pester says that IBM experts are helping to fix the IT issues....but if it was a simple problem, we would have fixed it, he adds. Stuart Hosie now challenges Paul Pester over his claim that most of the bank is running smoothly. One of Hosie\u2019s constituents found that his standing orders had bounced yesterday (a problem TSB claims to have fixed). A second customer has an even more worrying story - he tried to pay seven cheques into his local branch, but the staff couldn\u2019t make the system work. He tried to access his balance on another account, Hosie continues, and staff couldn\u2019t get into it. This customer has been locked out of their business account since 20 April, and their complaint hasn\u2019t even been responded to. Fixing Pester with a steely look, Hosie declares: It isn\u2019t just the online, it isn\u2019t just the digital, it\u2019s the technology in the branch [too], and the complaints aren\u2019t being addressed, are they? Pester says TSB have responded to 22,290 of the 40,000 complaints received since the IT migration. It is in the process of dealing with the rest, and he apologises to this constituent. SNP MP Stuart Hosie asks if Pester understands the importance of digital services today, when a broken app is as bad as a closed branch. Pester agrees. He says TSB\u2019s busiest time is typically between 7.30am and 8.30am, as customers check balances over breakfast or on the way to work. Q: So why weren\u2019t you ready for the demand when you brought your services back online (on Sunday night, April 22nd)? Pester says the bank had assumed very high usage of its telephone services, the internet banking, and its mobile app. TSB thought that it was ready -- Slaughter and May\u2019s independent review has to discover why it wasn\u2019t. Nicky Morgan has more inside information from TSB - a worker who says they weren\u2019t actually allowed to fail things in testing, only say they had passed or need more work. Pester says TSB\u2019s testing operation will be examined as part of its review. Q: And why are people who closed accounts years ago now getting texts? Did you move too much data? Pester says TSB has to hold customer data for seven years. Q: Was your bonus contingent on getting this migration done now, Mr Pester? Pester denies it. He says there was a \u201creward\u201d for getting the operation done, but not at a particular time. [Background: in February, TSB\u2019s board decided to withholding a potential \u00a31 million-plus payment for Pester until the bank completed its delayed IT improvements.] Rushanara Ali turns to Sabadell\u2019s COO, Miquel Montes. Q: Would this migration have saved \u00a3100m per year? (on fees paid to Lloyds?) Montes confirms that this is the case Q: Did you speed the migration up because there was a financial benefit? Montes denies it. All decisions taken by the TSB board have been backed by Sabadell, he says. Q: So there was no pressure on TSB to move quickly? Pester jumps in, saying there was no pressure from TSB\u2019s parent company. Q: So why didn\u2019t the migration work? Pester says he\u2019s handled several migrations before - including bringing Alliance &amp; Leicester and Bradford &amp; Bingley onto Santander (following the financial crisis) and carving TSB out of Lloyds. Subtext: he knew what he was doing.... Now chairman Richard Meddings chips in - he confirms that TSB have called legal firm Slaughter &amp; May in to carry out a review. He\u2019s happy to share the conclusions with MPs when it\u2019s done. Labour MP Rushanara Ali takes issue with Pester\u2019s claim that TSB customers should get in touch with problems. She points out that customers have suffered long delays on its helplines, or lengthy journeys to their nearest bank. Q: What have the bank done to help? Pester says the bank have prioritised vulnerable customers, and also searched social media to find customers affected. Ali isn\u2019t impressed, saying that the tone of TSB\u2019s response hasn\u2019t been good enough. Pester isn\u2019t winning his audience over, judging by these tweets from watching journalists: CEO Paul Pester is trying to persuade the Treasury committee that the situation isn\u2019t that bad really. The engine of the bank is running smoothly, the issue is handling enough customers trying to log on simultaneously, particularly through our app and our digital channels. But Nicky Morgan has another trump card - a second member of the committee now can\u2019t into their TSB account. It\u2019s great to have so many customers, grins Pester (ill-advisedly, I think). \u201cThank you very much for using TSB\u201d Morgan shoots back that it\u2019s not clear how much longer they\u2019ll actually be TSB customers. Q: Hasn\u2019t this IT migration been a complete failure, asks Charlie Elphicke MP. It\u2019s not been a complete failure, Paul Pester insists - sticking to his earlier argument that much of the migration went smoothly (it\u2019s just that lots of customers couldn\u2019t actually do any banking). Pester reveals that TSB has received 40,000 complaints since the migration (on April 20-22nd). It would normally receive 3,000 over the same period. They are being investigated, and they will be put right. Charlie Elphicke MP takes up the cudgel, asking about TSB\u2019s senior management regime - and who take responsibility for this mess? Q: Who does the buck stop with? It stops with me, says Pester. Q: So you take responsibility? I take absolutely responsibility, Q: Have you failed in the basic duty to customers? Pester says he is proud of TSB\u2019s work since it was spun out of Lloyds in 2013. I\u2019m deeply sad that the good work of the last five years has been so damaged over the last 10 days, Pester continues, but we will come back. Q: But how can your customers ever trust you again, Mr Pester? Because I will ensure that we get TSB out of these problems, and that no customers end up out of pocket. A TSB customer has tweeted the committee about the irony of watching Paul Pester saying there are no problems logging into TSB, while \u201csimultaneously trying and failing to log into my account\u201d. How can you say that this migration went smoothly? Nicky Morgan asks. Paul Pester says he has data showing him that almost all customers are getting online,. If people are struggling, please contact us, he says. [That won\u2019t cut much ice with customers who have reported long delays on its telephone line] Nicky Morgan plays her trump card -- one of the committee\u2019s own staff are trying to log in, and they can\u2019t log in either. Nicky Morgan asks about another case, about a TSB customer who says they were let down by the bank, and has subsequently passed away. In response, chairman Richard Meddings also apologises for the IT migration failures. Nicky Morgan says Pester is downplaying the problems at TSB. She quotes an email from a TSB customer who has suffered disruption for the last two weeks. This person has seen their balance fluctuate, been unable to withdraw cash, and with no idea if their data has been compromised. How is someone supposed to cope without banking services for two weeks? Could Paul Pester cope? Pester says he doesn\u2019t recognise this situation. He says that there have been problems getting enough customers online at the same time, but that around 50% of customers who tried to log in, were able to at anyone time. Morgan isn\u2019t impressed - are you saying this customer isn\u2019t telling the truth? There\u2019s no group of customers who haven\u2019t been able to log in since the migration, Pester insists. Morgan cites another email, from a TSB customer who hasn\u2019t been able to buy a house as they can\u2019t access three months of bank statement? Isn\u2019t it complacent to say that this migration went well, when people are not in control of their bank accounts? The session is underway. Committee chair Nicky Morgan begins by quoting TSB\u2019s ambition to become \u201ca digital business that just happens to be a bank\u201d. Isn\u2019t the truth that it is actually a broken bank? CEO Paul Pester begins by apologising for the disruption suffered by customers since the IT migration last month, saying he is truly sorry. But he insists that much of the migration worked well - balances were accurately transferred \u201cto the penny\u201d and the underlying engine of the bank is running relatively smoothly But, the platform\u2019s ability to allow enough people to log in at the same time hasn\u2019t worked well enough - preventing some customers from using its internet banking service and mobile app. That has led to an unacceptable experience for some customer, Pester says, apologising again. While we wait for the hearing to begin, here\u2019s our latest news story on TSB.... The Treasury committee hearing on TSB\u2019s IT problems is due to start in five minutes. The witnesses are TSB chief executive Paul Pester and chairman Richard Meddings, plus Miquel Montes, chief operating officer of Sabadell Group (TSB\u2019s parent company). It should be streamed live here. Back in the 1980s, TSB billed itself as \u201cThe Bank That Likes to Say Yes\u201d, in a series of jaunty adverts: Satirical magazine Private Eye have now helpfully updated the slogan for today\u2019s circumstances: TSB\u2019s IT meltdown crisis has reared its head at Prime Minister\u2019s Questions. Nicky Morgan MP, chair of the Treasury committee, tells the House of Commons that the crisis has had very severe consequences for thousands of customers. It is unfair to businesses, to vulnerable customers, and it is particularly unfair when banks are closing branches, Morgan says (giving TSB a taste of this afternoon\u2019s grilling). Does the prime minister agree that \u201ca robust and reliable banking IT infrastructure\u201d is essential in the modern economy. Theres May says she certainly does agree that a \u201crobust, safe and reliable\u201d IT system is essential to underpin modern banking. She\u2019s sure the Treasury Committee will get to the bottom of what went wrong at TSB, starting with today\u2019s hearing. Another question for MPs: why has TSB\u2019s board called in a top UK law firm, Slaughter &amp; May? Sky News\u2019s Mark Kleinman has more details: Sky News has learnt that directors of the UK\u2019s sixth-biggest bank have asked Slaughter &amp; May to conduct an independent probe of the circumstances leading to the IT upgrade which has prompted a furious backlash from thousands of customers. The appointment of Slaughters, one of the so-called \u201cMagic Circle\u201d law firms, has been rubber-stamped by TSB\u2019s board and is expected to be confirmed by directors when they appear in front of MPs on the Treasury Select Committee later on Wednesday. MPs on the Treasury committee could also ask TSB about the weird and less-than-wonderful state of its online banking site. Technology expert Chris Applegate took a look under the bonnet yesterday, and recoiled after uncovering a host of errors and questionable coding work. Some of the errors suggest that stressed techies are making basic mistakes as they race to get TSB\u2019s banking services online again. Also... the site\u2019s security certificate - used to secure credit card transactions and log-in details - will soon be out of date. Not a good sign at all. This is TSB\u2019s front-end code, for the pages seen by customers, rather than the digital nuts and bolts underpinning the bank. But it\u2019s still not a reassuring sight. Oof! Britain\u2019s economy is suffering its worst run against the US and the eurozone in 12 years. So says Barret Kupelian, senior economist at PwC. He has crunched today\u2019s eurozone GDP figures (see 10.12am) and compared them to last Friday\u2019s growth data for Britain and America. And as you can see, Britain\u2019s annual growth rate started dipping at the end of 2016 -- the year of the EU referendum: It\u2019s particularly disappointing as the wider global economy has been enjoying decent growth of late, as Kupelian explains: \u201cToday\u2019s flash estimate of Eurozone GDP growth for the first quarter of 2018 shows that the bloc as a whole grew by 0.4% quarter-on-quarter. This is broadly in line with expectations but slower than the 0.7% growth rate recorded in Q4 2017. However, these preliminary Eurozone figures are likely to be revised once national authorities release their data. \u201cThis was the fifth out of seven consecutive quarters that the Eurozone grew faster than the UK following the EU referendum. This suggests that the UK has not been able to reap the full benefits of an upturn in global economic activity unlike other large economies like the Eurozone and the US. \u201cThis now means that the UK has been the slowest growing economy relative to the US and the Eurozone for the fourth consecutive quarter - something last experienced 12 years ago. Economist Rupert Seggins has also shown how Britain is lagging behind: Several TSB customers are tweeting their unhappiness that the bank has billed them their usual monthly charge, despite the disruption of the last 12 days. Although some of TSB\u2019s current accounts are free, it charges \u00a39.95 per month for its Silver account, and \u00a38.95/month for its \u2018select\u2019 option (no longer available). TSB wrote to customers this week, promised to waive overdraft fees for March and April and promising that no-one will be left \u2018out of pocket\u2019. But still, charging account fees when people haven\u2019t had the usual service clearly rankles with some customers. Another newsflash: Growth across the eurozone slowed to 0.4% in the first three months of 2018. That\u2019s down from 0.7% 0.6% in October-December 2017, and highlights how the global economy has softened in recent months. This also means the eurozone grew faster than Britain - again (as UK GDP only rose by 0.1% during the quarter). We\u2019d like to hear from TSB customers who are still suffering from the IT problems. You can get in touch anonymously here. Back to TSB, and writer Michelle Davies is still having problems with her bank account: Better news: UK construction sector returned to growth in April, as builders returned to work after the \u2018Beast from the East\u2019 disrupted activity in March. A quick economic newsflash: Growth across the eurozone\u2019s factories has slowed to a 13-month low. Data firm Markit reports that activity across Europe\u2019s manufacturers cooled in April, with growth slowing in the Netherlands, Germany, Italy, Spain and Greece. It\u2019s due to a drop in new order growth, meaning firms took on fewer new staff. Firms reported that new order growth slowed last month, as did new hirings, as the strong growth of 2017 fades. However, at least factories are still expanding. The overall eurozone factory PMI fell to 56.2 in April, from 56.6 in March (any reading over 50 shows growth). [for comparison, the UK factory PMI fell to 53.9 yesterday, a 17-month low) It\u2019s more than a week since TSB\u2019s chief Paul Pester tweeted that \u201cour mobile banking app and online banking are now up and running\u201d...and yet there are still problems. The bank\u2019s service status page warns that customers can\u2019t see their mortgage account via internet banking and the mobile app. Some business customers are still struggling to make payments online - which could be disastrous for a firm which needs to pay suppliers or staff. Replacement debit and credit cards are currently taking a little longer to process too. If customers can\u2019t get online, TSB recommends they try \u201cclosing your mobile app fully and then restarting it, or closing your internet browser and trying again\u201d. Advice straight out of The IT Crowd.... Reuters has also investigated the TBS crisis -- and confirmed that rushed and inadequate testing and poor internal communication were to blame. Reporter Lawrence White explains: \u201cThere wasn\u2019t time to test everything, digital and mobile payment testing weren\u2019t properly scoped, so it wasn\u2019t a surprise to me when it went live last week and those parts didn\u2019t work,\u201d said one source, a project manager who oversaw people working on the upgrade, referring to the testing up to the first deadline. A second source, a software tester, said tests were in some cases poorly designed or rushed in order to meet the initial project launch date. He also cited a lack of communication between IT and the business about who was managing the testing. Some background: TSB\u2019s IT meltdown was created because the bank moved from its old technology at Lloyds Bank (who sold it in 2013) onto a new system created by current owner Sabadell. Insiders have told us that the team working on the migration were set unrealistically tight deadlines that didn\u2019t acknowledge the challenge of unpicking TSB out of Lloyds\u2019 sprawling network of legacy systems. My colleague Sam Gibbs wrote about the mess on Saturday: By the summer of 2016, work on developing the new system was meant to be well under way and December 2017 was set as a hard-and-fast deadline for delivery. \u201cThe time period to develop the new system and migrate TSB over to it was just 18 months,\u201d the insider said. \u201cI thought this was ridiculous. TSB people were saying that Sabadell had done this many times in Spain. But tiny Spanish local banks are not sprawling LBG legacy systems.\u201d To make matters worse, the Sabadell development team did not have full control \u2013 and therefore a full understanding \u2013 of the system they were trying to migrate customer data and systems from because Lloyds Banking Group was still the supplier. \u201cThis turned what was a super-hard systems job [into] a clusterfuck in the making,\u201d the insider said. By March 2017, the nightmare for customers that was going to unfold a year later appeared inevitable. \u201cIt was unbelievable \u2013 hardly even a prototype or proof of concept, yet it was supposed to be fully tested and working by May before the integration work started,\u201d the insider continued. \u201cSenior staff were furious about the state it was in. Even logging in was problematic.\u201d MPs must ask Pester why the bank didn\u2019t heed these warning signs, and instead plunged on into the current mess. Some TSB customers are fuming this morning after it emerged that the bank had failed to execute their standing orders yesterday. The blunder affected important bills, such as monthly rent payments, set to be paid at the start of the new month. Scientist Stacey Bell found herself caught up in the mess, when her rent found its way back into her account: TSB says the issue has been fixed - but it has created further anxiety among its customers: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Twelve days ago, TSB pressed the button to switch its 5 million customers onto a shiny new IT platform. Later today, the bank\u2019s top brass will try to explain to MPs why they made such a botch of it. TSB chief executive Paul Pester and chairman Richard Meddings will face parliament\u2019s Treasury committee at 2.30pm today, to answer questions about why millions of customers were locked out of their internet and mobile bank services for days. They\u2019ll be accompanied by Miquel Montes, chief operating officer of TSB\u2019s parent company, Sabadell, which oversaw the move onto the Proteo4UK platform. Pester - who took personal control of the mess nearly a week ago - will be quizzed on what exactly went wrong, and why TSB hasn\u2019t been able to get back online. Was the system tested properly, and why wasn\u2019t there a contingency plan in case gremlins struck? And are customers really going to be properly compensated for their losses, and the inconvenience they have suffered? My colleague Patrick Collinson has helpfully drawn up a list of questions for the MPs to bang over the net to the trio: Why didn\u2019t the new computer system work? TSB spent, by its own admission, 2,500 human years on the IT transfer from Lloyds, with 1,000 people involved in one way or another. Why did it fail? Did TSB perform thorough testing prior to flicking the switch on the migration of user accounts? Why did the testing not uncover the issues? How thorough can it have been, given issues became apparent almost immediately? Was there a back-up? Sabadell\u2019s takeover of TSB was predicated almost entirely on the \u00a3100m savings to be made from cutting TSB free from the \u00a3214m-a-year bill it had to pay Lloyds for continuing to run the bank\u2019s accounts. Was it rushed through, without sufficient back-up? Why was the old system not still in place to mitigate customer troubles when it was clear Proteo4UK, the name given to the new platform, was not up to the task? Why were customers misinformed? The transition was scheduled from Friday evening to Sunday evening. When failures began appearing, almost immediately afterwards, TSB initially said the problems were only \u201cintermittent\u201d. Early on Wednesday, Pester said the system was \u201cup and running\u201d again but customers continued to report problems. Who was in control? Much is being made of a rift between TSB in the UK and Sabadell in Spain. Pictures on LinkedIn showed celebrating IT workers in Madrid toasting the \u201csuccess\u201d of the transfer. Pester is now paying for IBM specialists to fix the problems. Will Pester pin the blame on head office in Spain or other external contractors? Will Pester still receive a \u00a31.6m bonus? He may try to dodge this by saying bonuses are at the discretion of the remuneration committee, and nothing has been decided. But MPs are likely to press Pester on whether he think he deserves a bonus after this fiasco. How will TSB compensate customers? The bank has promised that no one will be left out of pocket. But will they receive compensation only if they complain? Will the bankcontact customers? And what does it expect the compensation bill to be? Did regulation work? MPs will want to know the extent to which the giant transfer of 1.3bn records was supervised by regulators such as the Financial Conduct Authority, and what it says about the robustness of Britain\u2019s banking infrastructure. TSB will have to tell MPs how far the debacle has exposed customers\u2019 data, and how much, if at all, any accounts have been compromised Also coming up today We\u2019ll be wading through a river of data this morning, with new surveys of the eurozone factory sector and Britain\u2019s builders. We also get the first estimate of eurozone growth in the first quarter of this year. Growth is expected to have slowed to around 0.4%, from 0.6% in the last three months of 2017 - still rather better than Britain\u2019s slothlike 0.1% expansion...

Why did it fail? Did TSB perform thorough testing prior to flicking the switch on the migration of user accounts? Why did the testing not uncover the issues? How thorough can it have been, given issues became apparent almost immediately?<br></li> <li><strong>Was there a back-up? </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/mar/20/how-will-the-takeover-of-tsb-affect-me\">Sabadell\u2019s takeover of TSB</a> was predicated almost entirely on the \u00a3100m savings to be made from cutting TSB free from the \u00a3214m-a-year bill it had to pay Lloyds for continuing to run the bank\u2019s accounts. Was it rushed through, without sufficient back-up? Why was the old system not still in place to mitigate customer troubles when it was clear Proteo4UK, the name given to the new platform, was not up to the task? <br></li> <li><strong>Why were customers misinformed? </strong>The transition was scheduled from Friday evening to Sunday evening. When <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/23/tsb-online-banking-failure-prompts-complaints\">failures began appearing</a>, almost immediately afterwards, TSB initially said the problems were only \u201cintermittent\u201d. Early on Wednesday, Pester said the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2018/apr/25/tsb-online-banking-mobile-app-paul-pester-business-live?page=with:block-5ae01a58e4b0ed4091d25a53#block-5ae01a58e4b0ed4091d25a53\">system was \u201cup and running\u201d </a>again but customers continued to report problems.</li> <li><strong>Who was in control?</strong> Much is being made of a rift between TSB in the UK and Sabadell in Spain.

Pester is now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2018/apr/26/tsb-crisis-bank-waives-overdraft-fees-paul-pester-ecb-mario-draghi-business-live?page=with:block-5ae1d4bde4b026c402d85e0f#block-5ae1d4bde4b026c402d85e0f\">paying for IBM specialists</a> to fix the problems.

But will they receive compensation only if they complain? Will the bankcontact customers? And what does it expect the compensation bill to be?</li> <li><strong>Did regulation work? </strong>MPs will want to know the extent to which the giant transfer of 1.3bn records was supervised by regulators such as the Financial Conduct Authority, and what it says about the robustness of Britain\u2019s banking infrastructure. TSB will have to tell MPs how far the debacle has exposed customers\u2019 data, and how much, if at all, any accounts have been compromised</li> </ul> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/01/tsb-crisis-the-key-questions-bank-bosses-will-need-to-answer\">TSB crisis: key questions MPs will ask bank bosses about IT crash</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Also coming up today</h2> <p>We\u2019ll be wading through a river of data this morning, with new surveys of the eurozone factory sector and Britain\u2019s builders.</p> <p>We also get the first estimate of eurozone growth in the first quarter of this year.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The first government-backed effort to revive onshore windfarms after ministers scrapped public subsidies for the technology has run into opposition in the western isles of Scotland. EDF Energy has said its plans for two major windfarms on the Isle of Lewis may need to reach heights normally the preserve of turbines at sea, prompting an outcry from residents. The French company\u2019s renewables unit said it may need higher turbines for the project to be economically viable and win millions of pounds in government subsidies. Kerry MacPhee, the head of community liaison at Lewis Wind Power, the EDF-led joint venture behind the plan, told locals this week that one of the windfarms could be 200 metres (650ft) tall, with the other 187 metres, up from 150 metres and 145 metres previously. That would be taller than the UK\u2019s largest existing onshore turbine (193.5 metres) and be on a par with some of the world\u2019s most powerful offshore wind turbines, which are 60 metres taller than the London Eye. MacPhee said the potential changes were designed to increase the project\u2019s chances of winning future auctions for low-carbon electricity and unlock \u201csubstantial benefits for Lewis\u201d. The Conservatives ended subsidies for onshore windfarms shortly after coming to power in 2015, citing public opposition to them. However, last year the government announced onshore wind could compete for subsidies if built on remote islands, where they could benefit communities and generate large-scale clean power. Claire Perry, the energy minister, has also hinted at a return for the technology on the mainland, saying she is \u201clooking carefully\u201d at supporting onshore windfarms in Scotland and Wales \u2013 but not England. EDF said it was likely, but not guaranteed, that fewer turbines would be needed for the Lewis project than the original 36 planned. Bigger turbines would also require a new application for planning approval, allowing opponents a chance to air their opinions. Critics remain unimpressed, however. Four crofting groups have been battling EDF\u2019s proposal, arguing that local people would benefit more if the island\u2019s wind resource was harnessed by community-owned turbines. Rhoda MacKenzie, a spokesperson for the crofters, said: \u201cIt\u2019s going to have a detrimental effect on tourism. The largest wind turbines in the UK? I hardly think that\u2019s going to bring people here.\u201d Calum MacDonald, a former MP who backs an expansion of community-owned wind power, said the turbine size was staggering. EDF has said there would be no case for more community windfarms without a new power cable to the mainland. The estimated \u00a3780m investment needed for such an interconnector would only be justified by electricity generation on the scale proposed by EDF. Wind power developers fighting in auctions for government subsidies across Europe are increasingly dependent on scale to win contracts by bidding with the lowest subsidy price. The next UK auction is scheduled for the spring of 2019.",

      "bodyText": "The online delivery service Just Eat served up strong revenues in the first three months of the year, while Pizza Express profits dropped due to higher costs and Britain\u2019s casual dining crunch. While takeaway food has become very popular, many restaurant chains are struggling, faced with rising costs and worsening consumer confidence. Strong order growth and a bigger proportion of higher value delivery orders propelled revenues at Just Eat 49% to \u00a3177.4m. UK orders climbed 24% to 29.7m, after the firm gobbled up the rival Hungryhouse. Just Eat was the top riser on the FTSE 100 index, with its shares up more than 4%. The firm stuck to its guidance of \u00a3660m to \u00a3700m of annual revenues, which analysts said was too conservative. Just Eat has traditionally collected orders on behalf of independent restaurants which deliver the food themselves, but has started delivering for chains such as KFC and Burger King. Pizza Express, the chain founded in London in 1965 that has been owned by Chinese investment group Hony Capital since 2014, reported an 8.9% drop in underlying profits to \u00a394.6m last year. Its chief executive, Jinlong Wang, blamed higher food prices and wage increases as well as the rise in business rates and commercial rents. However, Pizza Express, which opened 13 new restaurants and modernised 25 others last year, has fared better than rivals, many of which are in closing outlets. Like-for-like sales in the UK and Ireland edged up by 0.4% and overall turnover rose by 6.3% to \u00a3534.2m. One in three of the UK\u2019s top 100 restaurant groups are loss making, a recent study showed. Many mid-market chains such as Jamie\u2019s Italian, Prezzo, and Strada have been shutting restaurants.",

      "bodyText": "A pick-up in housebuilding helped the hard-pressed UK construction sector to bounce back last month from the harsh winter weather that led to a shutdown of building sites in March. After dropping sharply as a result of the blizzards brought to Britain by the \u201cbeast from the east\u201d, the latest health check showed construction \u2013 which accounts for 6% of the economy \u2013 returning to growth in April. However, demand for new buildings remained subdued, according to the Markit/Cips UK construction purchasing managers\u2019 index, with total new work rising only modestly on the month. The PMI rose to 52.5 last month, up from 47 in March. Economists were expecting a figure of 50.5. A reading above 50 represents growth. Tim Moore, the associate director at IHS Markit, which compiled the report, said: \u201cA rebound in construction activity was pretty well inevitable after snowfall resulted in severe disruptions on-site during March. \u201cHousebuilding led the way, with growth in April among the strongest seen over the past two and a half years. However, the picture was less positive in other areas of construction, with commercial building and civil engineering work rising only marginally.\u201d Moore added that heightened economic uncertainty was creating a risk-averse mood among clients, leading to spending plans being delayed. The barometer of construction activity slumped to 47 last month from 51.4 in February. Bad weather had a particularly heavy impact on civil engineering projects, according to the survey of more than 170 construction firms. The survey is watched by the Bank of England to gauge what is happening at grassroots level in the economy. The better-than-expected performance by construction helped lift the pound from a four-month low against the dollar, but was seen as having no impact on the Bank\u2019s interest-rate decision next week. After weak recent data, borrowing costs are predicted to remain on hold. Samuel Tombs, the chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: \u201cHousebuilding remains the standout subsector; the housing PMI jumped to 57.4 in April \u2013 its highest level since May 2017 \u2013 from 51.1 in March. \u201cBut the PMIs for the commercial and civil engineering sectors rose only to 51.2 and 51.5 respectively, from 46.4 and 43.6 in March. The long investment time horizons for commercial and civil engineering projects mean that both sectors likely will remain depressed until some clarity emerges over the UK\u2019s long-term relationship with the EU. \u201cIn addition, the construction sector will be hurt by a planned 5.4% year-over-year reduction in public sector gross investment in this fiscal year. As a result, the odds of the construction sector enjoying a sustained recovery this year still look remote.\u201d",

Horse racing fans were left with little to bet on after the heavy snowfall dumped by the \u201cbeast from the east\u201d led to the cancellation of about 400 meetings in the UK and Ireland between January and March, equivalent to 14% of all scheduled races. In the first quarter of 2017, just 4% of fixtures were called-off. In a trading update, the bookmaker said customers were also hit by unexpected results from big clubs such as Arsenal between November and February, which contributed to a 2% drop in revenue to \u00a3408m in the three months to 31 March because it put people off placing bets. The north London club won only two away matches in the Premier League during that period, at Burnley and Crystal Palace. \u201cCustomers like to win,\u201d a spokesperson for the bookmaker said. \u201cIf you have a sustained run of bookmaker-friendly results it will have a knock-on effect on customer activity.\u201d In a potential sweetener for shareholders, the FTSE 100 company announced plans to return \u00a3500m of cash to investors over the next 12 to 18 months through a share buyback programme. Its chief executive, Peter Jackson, said Paddy Power had made good progress, but the City appeared to disagree, with shares down 6%, making it the biggest faller on the FTSE 100 or 250. Underlying earnings in the first quarter fell 8% to \u00a3102m, and the company is expecting earnings for the full year in 2018 to be between \u00a3470m and \u00a3495m, below City expectations of about \u00a3500m. Greg Johnson, travel and leisure analyst at Shore Capital, said the first quarter performance was disappointing and lowered the investment group\u2019s recommendation from hold to sell. \u201cWe do not believe that this slower growth and potential headwinds are fully factored into the [share] price,\u201d he said. Revenue at Paddy Power\u2019s Australian business, Sportsbet, rose 6% in the first quarter, despite adverse sports results. \u201cSportsbet continues to perform well and is targeting further market share growth, with additional investment planned to take advantage of any disruption arising from market consolidation and the introduction of increased taxes,\u201d Jackson said.",
