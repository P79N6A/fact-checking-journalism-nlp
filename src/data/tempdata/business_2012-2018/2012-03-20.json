The labour rules have been blamed for creating southern Europe's two-tier system, where older staff monopolise protected roles and the young are either left unemployed or stranded in precarious short-term jobs.</p> <p>More than 30% of 18 to 24-year-olds in Italy are unemployed, and only about 57% of Italians have a job, giving the country one of the lowest employment rates and slowest growth in the eurozone.</p> <p>Geithner warned that eurozone policymakers would have to be \"careful to calibrate the mix of financial support and the pace of fiscal consolidation.</p> <p>\"The reforms will take time and they will not work without financial support that enables governments to borrow at affordable rates and keeps the overall rates of interest across the economy at levels that won't kill growth.\"</p> <p>The US recovery had been far stronger than Europe's, Geithner said, and the US was ahead of Europe on \"nearly every measure\". In part this was because \"Europe's financial system became much larger, much more leveraged and much riskier, even than the US financial sector,\" he said.</p> <p>But while the US had begun to recover, Europe's malaise was \"one of the most important factors that has kept growth in the US down\". Geithner said the situation was far less worrying than it had been six months ago but added: \"One should be very realistic about the challenges Europe still faces. A lot of challenges are still ahead for us and for them.\"</p> <p>Geithner and the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben Bernanke, will address Europe's financial woes and their likely impact in the US again this week at a hearing of the House committee on oversight and government reform.</p> <p>Last month Bernanke told Congress that Europe's financial crisis had slowed the US recovery. Reforms were under way, he said: \"However, critical fiscal and financial challenges remain for the eurozone, the resolution of which will require concerted action on the part of European authorities. Further steps will also be required to boost growth and competitiveness in a number of countries.\"</p>",

The labour rules have been blamed for creating southern Europe's two-tier system, where older staff monopolise protected roles and the young are either left unemployed or stranded in precarious short-term jobs. More than 30% of 18 to 24-year-olds in Italy are unemployed, and only about 57% of Italians have a job, giving the country one of the lowest employment rates and slowest growth in the eurozone. Geithner warned that eurozone policymakers would have to be \"careful to calibrate the mix of financial support and the pace of fiscal consolidation. \"The reforms will take time and they will not work without financial support that enables governments to borrow at affordable rates and keeps the overall rates of interest across the economy at levels that won't kill growth.\" The US recovery had been far stronger than Europe's, Geithner said, and the US was ahead of Europe on \"nearly every measure\". In part this was because \"Europe's financial system became much larger, much more leveraged and much riskier, even than the US financial sector,\" he said. But while the US had begun to recover, Europe's malaise was \"one of the most important factors that has kept growth in the US down\". Geithner said the situation was far less worrying than it had been six months ago but added: \"One should be very realistic about the challenges Europe still faces. A lot of challenges are still ahead for us and for them.\" Geithner and the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben Bernanke, will address Europe's financial woes and their likely impact in the US again this week at a hearing of the House committee on oversight and government reform. Last month Bernanke told Congress that Europe's financial crisis had slowed the US recovery. Reforms were under way, he said: \"However, critical fiscal and financial challenges remain for the eurozone, the resolution of which will require concerted action on the part of European authorities. Further steps will also be required to boost growth and competitiveness in a number of countries.\"",

      "bodyText": "In the clearest sign yet that the heady days of China's manufacturing boom are over, BHP Billiton, the world's biggest mining company, said iron-ore demand from China was \"flattening\". The comments fuelled fears that the engine behind the global economic recovery is slowing down, and triggered a sell-off in mining stocks. Fresnillo, Antofagasta and Rio Tinto were among the worst casualties, all trailing near the bottom of the FTSE 100 index. BHP shares ended the day down 4% at \u00a319.65. China has been hoovering up stocks of iron ore, which is used to make steel, as it undergoes a modern-day industrial revolution. Among the main beneficiaries have been iron-ore miners in Australia, which have boosted output from 80m tonnes a decade ago to nearly 500m tonnes today. But demand is starting to slow as Beijing has moved to cool its economy. The Chinese premier, Wen Jiabao, said last week that he would keep measures in place during his last year in office to deflate asset bubbles in the country. Beijing has forecast that the Chinese economy will grow by 7.5% this year, well below the 9.2% growth last year and 10.4% in 2010. Speaking ahead of the annual global iron ore and steel forecast conference in Perth, Ian Ashby, president of iron ore at BHP, said he was confident China would meet its five-year economic growth targets but said iron-ore demand would soon hit \"single digits, if it's not already there\". \"The [Chinese] economy is shifting, it's changing,\" he said. \"Steel growth rates will flatten and they have flattened.\" The country's annual steel output was still expected to rise by about 60% by 2025, he said, arguing that the drivers for growth were still in place. By 2050 nearly three-quarters of China's 1.4 billion population is expected to be urbanised, he said, compared with less than half in 2010. Car production is also forecast to shoot up by 155% by 2025 to 28m units a year. BHP said it was ready to respond to cooling demand but would still push ahead with its ambitious $10bn (\u00a36.3bn) expansion plan, mining 165m-170m tonnes of ore a year. The company is the world's third-largest iron-ore miner behind Vale and Rio Tinto. The latter is also sticking with plans to raise capacity from its mines in western Australia's Pilbara iron-ore belt, betting on a soft landing for the Chinese economy. Analysts say even single-digit growth in Chinese ore demand should be enough to soak up the planned output expansion. Iron ore sold for $130-$147 a tonne over the last four months. A report out on Monday predicted that global demand for iron ore would double to 3.5bn tonnes a year by 2030, with Chinese appetite continuing to drive the market, albeit at a slower pace than during the last decade. The report, from the Perth-based Intierra Resource Intelligence, also said that Indian iron-ore exports could decline as the country's steel companies expand. There is a tussle between Indian iron mining companies, which claim there is enough of the commodity for both exports and increased domestic steel production, and the steel lobby, which wants to see exports curbed. Paul Gray, analyst at Wood Mackenzie, said: \"Certainly the rate of growth in Chinese demand is slowing, but the growth is from an ever-increasing base so the number of iron units required continues to rise.\"",

    "fields": {
      "standfirst": "Comments from BHP Billiton about weaker iron ore demand from China hit mining sector and FTSE 100", 
      "body": "<p>As markets headed firmly south - mainly on worries about a slowdown in demand from China - <strong>Vodafone</strong> has bucked the trend.</p> <p>The mobile phone group has climbed 3.45p to 170.8p - the biggest riser in the FTSE 100 - following a positive recommendation from Morgan Stanley, in which the bank raised the prospect (again) of a possible takeover by US partner Verizon.</p> <p>It said there was a $100bn gap in the valuation of their joint venture Verizon Wireless implied by the two companies' share prices, with Vodafone the more attractively valued share of the two. It said one way of resolving this would be for Vodafone to sell its Verizon Wireless stake, but this would have tax implications. A merger would also be possible, but the bank said it was hard to see why Vodafone shareholders would accept such a deal:</p> <blockquote> <p>This leaves an acquisition of Vodafone by Verizon as the classical solution to a valuation disparity of this sort. Vodafone shareholders would likely require a significant portion of consideration in cash. A new Verizon levered at 3 times could in theory raise $100bn for such a transaction, but whether such a large amount can be raised today in practice is uncertain. Any share consideration would be subject to valuation and flow-back concerns, though this could be mitigated by a local listing.</p> </blockquote> <p>Vodafone was also lifted by news that India's supreme court had dismissed a plea from the tax office against a ruling the mobile phone group was not liable for $2.2bn tax on its purchase of assets in 2007.</p> <p>Meanwhile Vodafone's putative takeover target <strong>Cable &amp; Wireless Worldwide</strong> climbed 3.11p to 38, amid talk that rival bidder Tata Communications of India was preparing to make an offer. But it is believed nothing has changed since early March when Tata's interest first became public. The Indian company has until the end of the month to make its decision, and is not expected to act either way until closer to the deadline.</p> <p>Overall the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> fell 69.70 points to 5891.41 with mining shares leading the way lower. The catalyst was downbeat comments on Chinese demand for iron ore from <strong>BHP Billiton</strong>, down 83p to \u00a319.65. <strong>Rio Tinto</strong> lost 150p to 3464.5p while <strong>Anglo American </strong>dropped 107.5p to \u00a325.05.</p> <p><strong>Fresnillo </strong>fell 89p to \u00a316.87 as gold lost ground on fears of the effect of an Indian import duty on demand from the country's consumer.</p> <p><strong>Glencore</strong> dipped 6.65p to 413.8p after it confirmed a story here on Monday about a C$16 a share offer for Canadian grain specialist Viterra, valuing the target at C$6.1bn.</p> <p>Meanwhile <strong>Unilever</strong> fell 25p to \u00a320.64 after Investec downgraded its buy recommendation for the first time since 1995. Analyst Martin Deboo said:</p> <blockquote> <p>We move to holders, for the first time since 1995 (yes really.) Despite the symbolism, this reflects less a fundamental change of view but more a hard-nosed response to the threats of re-inflating commodities and change afoot at Procter &amp; Gamble, both of which need we think to be weighed against a still-not undemanding valuation. Fearing another of year of slow grind and risks to input cost guidance, we return to the pavilion, a little older and greyer.</p> </blockquote> <p>Among the risers <strong>Arm </strong>added 4.5p to 584.5p after both Barclays Capital and Investec issued positive notes, despite board director Mike Inglis announcing he was leaving in a year to take part in a round the world sailing race.</p> <p>Elsewhere <strong>Cairn Energy</strong> - which lost its place in the FTSE 100 as of Monday - climbed 9.9p to 341.8p. The exploration group reported a record $4.6bn profit in a year when it sold the bulk of its Indian business to Vedanta Resources and had mixed results from its Greenland programme. It said it had $1.2bn to spend - partly from the Indian proceeds - on new projects to offset its exposure to Greenland.</p> <p><strong>Babcock International</strong>, the engineering support services business, rose 29p to 772.5p following JP Morgan Cazenove raising its price target from 815p to 990p. Analyst Robert Plant said:</p> <blockquote> <p>Babcock's shares have lagged since the start of the year. In absolute terms they have risen by 2% but this means on a relative performance they have underperformed by 7%. We think some of this year's underperformance relates to switching into more cyclical stocks. We think Babcock's shares are worth looking at ahead of the fourth quarter trading statement and investor site trips on 27 March, especially given recent comments from other companies about a pick up in UK public sector outsourcing. </p> <p>UK defence is Babcock's main activity, accounting for around half of revenues. We thought one of the most interesting points from Capita's results was their comments about how opportunities in the defence market had opened up. We expect contract decisions in defence to next come from bids with the Defence Infrastructure Organisation (DIO) and Defence Equipment and Support (DE&amp;S) and this week's Sunday Times carried an article about the DE&amp;S which mentioned Babcock. International defence markets represent an interesting opportunity for Babcock and note its recent win with the Australian Navy.</p> </blockquote> <p>But <strong>Regus</strong>, the office space supplier, slipped 8.8p to 104p after full year profits of \u00a345.5m came in below expectations, despite nearly doubling. Peel Hunt said:</p> <blockquote> <p>Finals are slightly below consensus, reflecting accelerated growth costs. We do not change our bottom-end pretax profit estimates for 2012 and 2013, although a lower tax rate (20% versus 23%) pushes earnings per share slightly higher. Mature margins are better, but the price needs to recover for real upgrades and they are showing no conviction at present. We maintain our hold recommendation, but move our target price to 110p [from 75p] to reflect a more pro-cyclical attitude amongst investors.</p> </blockquote> <p>Lower down the market <strong>Mears</strong>, the social housing and care business, added 3p to 254.75p after it reported a 9% rise in pretax profits to \u00a331.5m. It also took a \u00a32m hit on its fledgling solar panels business after the government abandoned its planned photo-voltaic tariff. Chairman Bob Holt said:</p> <blockquote> <p>Whilst PV formed only a small add-on to our core social housing business, the speed of government change resulted in a disproportionate impact.</p> </blockquote> <p>The company has a record order book of \u00a32.9bn and has covered 94% of its forecast revenues for 2012.

      "bodyText": "As markets headed firmly south - mainly on worries about a slowdown in demand from China - Vodafone has bucked the trend. The mobile phone group has climbed 3.45p to 170.8p - the biggest riser in the FTSE 100 - following a positive recommendation from Morgan Stanley, in which the bank raised the prospect (again) of a possible takeover by US partner Verizon. It said there was a $100bn gap in the valuation of their joint venture Verizon Wireless implied by the two companies' share prices, with Vodafone the more attractively valued share of the two. It said one way of resolving this would be for Vodafone to sell its Verizon Wireless stake, but this would have tax implications. A merger would also be possible, but the bank said it was hard to see why Vodafone shareholders would accept such a deal: This leaves an acquisition of Vodafone by Verizon as the classical solution to a valuation disparity of this sort. Vodafone shareholders would likely require a significant portion of consideration in cash. A new Verizon levered at 3 times could in theory raise $100bn for such a transaction, but whether such a large amount can be raised today in practice is uncertain. Any share consideration would be subject to valuation and flow-back concerns, though this could be mitigated by a local listing. Vodafone was also lifted by news that India's supreme court had dismissed a plea from the tax office against a ruling the mobile phone group was not liable for $2.2bn tax on its purchase of assets in 2007. Meanwhile Vodafone's putative takeover target Cable &amp; Wireless Worldwide climbed 3.11p to 38, amid talk that rival bidder Tata Communications of India was preparing to make an offer. But it is believed nothing has changed since early March when Tata's interest first became public. The Indian company has until the end of the month to make its decision, and is not expected to act either way until closer to the deadline. Overall the FTSE 100 fell 69.70 points to 5891.41 with mining shares leading the way lower. The catalyst was downbeat comments on Chinese demand for iron ore from BHP Billiton, down 83p to \u00a319.65. Rio Tinto lost 150p to 3464.5p while Anglo American dropped 107.5p to \u00a325.05. Fresnillo fell 89p to \u00a316.87 as gold lost ground on fears of the effect of an Indian import duty on demand from the country's consumer. Glencore dipped 6.65p to 413.8p after it confirmed a story here on Monday about a C$16 a share offer for Canadian grain specialist Viterra, valuing the target at C$6.1bn. Meanwhile Unilever fell 25p to \u00a320.64 after Investec downgraded its buy recommendation for the first time since 1995. Analyst Martin Deboo said: We move to holders, for the first time since 1995 (yes really.) Despite the symbolism, this reflects less a fundamental change of view but more a hard-nosed response to the threats of re-inflating commodities and change afoot at Procter &amp; Gamble, both of which need we think to be weighed against a still-not undemanding valuation. Fearing another of year of slow grind and risks to input cost guidance, we return to the pavilion, a little older and greyer. Among the risers Arm added 4.5p to 584.5p after both Barclays Capital and Investec issued positive notes, despite board director Mike Inglis announcing he was leaving in a year to take part in a round the world sailing race. Elsewhere Cairn Energy - which lost its place in the FTSE 100 as of Monday - climbed 9.9p to 341.8p. The exploration group reported a record $4.6bn profit in a year when it sold the bulk of its Indian business to Vedanta Resources and had mixed results from its Greenland programme. It said it had $1.2bn to spend - partly from the Indian proceeds - on new projects to offset its exposure to Greenland. Babcock International, the engineering support services business, rose 29p to 772.5p following JP Morgan Cazenove raising its price target from 815p to 990p. Analyst Robert Plant said: Babcock's shares have lagged since the start of the year. In absolute terms they have risen by 2% but this means on a relative performance they have underperformed by 7%. We think some of this year's underperformance relates to switching into more cyclical stocks. We think Babcock's shares are worth looking at ahead of the fourth quarter trading statement and investor site trips on 27 March, especially given recent comments from other companies about a pick up in UK public sector outsourcing. UK defence is Babcock's main activity, accounting for around half of revenues. We thought one of the most interesting points from Capita's results was their comments about how opportunities in the defence market had opened up. We expect contract decisions in defence to next come from bids with the Defence Infrastructure Organisation (DIO) and Defence Equipment and Support (DE&amp;S) and this week's Sunday Times carried an article about the DE&amp;S which mentioned Babcock. International defence markets represent an interesting opportunity for Babcock and note its recent win with the Australian Navy. But Regus, the office space supplier, slipped 8.8p to 104p after full year profits of \u00a345.5m came in below expectations, despite nearly doubling. Peel Hunt said: Finals are slightly below consensus, reflecting accelerated growth costs. We do not change our bottom-end pretax profit estimates for 2012 and 2013, although a lower tax rate (20% versus 23%) pushes earnings per share slightly higher. Mature margins are better, but the price needs to recover for real upgrades and they are showing no conviction at present. We maintain our hold recommendation, but move our target price to 110p [from 75p] to reflect a more pro-cyclical attitude amongst investors. Lower down the market Mears, the social housing and care business, added 3p to 254.75p after it reported a 9% rise in pretax profits to \u00a331.5m. It also took a \u00a32m hit on its fledgling solar panels business after the government abandoned its planned photo-voltaic tariff. Chairman Bob Holt said: Whilst PV formed only a small add-on to our core social housing business, the speed of government change resulted in a disproportionate impact. The company has a record order book of \u00a32.9bn and has covered 94% of its forecast revenues for 2012. It is on the lookout for bolt-on acquisitions - some potentially quite large - with an emphasis on the care division. Analysts at its joint broker Investec lifted their price target from 238p to 283p with a buy recommendation. Punch Taverns put on 0.5p to 11.25p on talk of possible private equity interest, with a price of 22p a share mentioned by traders. Restore, the records management and office relocation business, rose 2p to 91p after reporting a 77% increase in full year profits to \u00a34.6m. Gareth Jones at Cenkos issued a buy note and said: Restore is currently valued at only 9.7 times 2012 earnings falling to 8.3 times 2013 earnings in relation to a sector average of 13 times.

      "bodyText": "Saudi Arabia promised to increase its oil supplies to ease worries over a shortfall from Iran, in a move that helped bring crude prices down from recent highs . The 1% drop in oil prices provided some relief to the UK government after inflation data earlier on Tuesday showed a smaller drop in overall price pressures than expected. Ministers and central bankers are hoping inflation will fall sharply this year, easing the pressure on households squeezed by meagre pay growth and rising unemployment. There were warnings that oil prices could still rise higher and stem the fall in inflation, but Saudi Arabia's assertion that it was pumping out oil at the fastest pace in decades brought Brent crude prices down to just above $124 a barrel. They had hit $127 earlier this year, fuelling fears that the fragile recovery in the global economy would be derailed. Saudi Arabia has been seeking to calm markets as tensions build between Iran, a key oil producer, and the west. The Saudi oil minister, Ali al-Naimi, declared on Tuesday that the kingdom could raise its output to a maximum capacity of 12.5m barrels a day if needed. \"I want to assure you there is no shortage of supply in the market,\" Naimi told reporters in Qatar, according to Reuters. He said supplies were outpacing global demand by more than 1m barrels a day. In the UK, however, economists were wary of revising their forecasts that inflation could prove stickier than the Bank of England expects, especially given that the effects of oil at $127 are still to be felt in some parts of the economy. The official data showed that lower energy bills for many UK homes helped bring the consumer prices index down slightly in February to the lowest level in more than a year. But at 3.4% it was still higher than forecasts of 3.3%. In coming months, high petrol prices and the threat of drought hitting crops and raising food prices are seen as likely to stall the downward trend. The Bank of England's chief economist, Spencer Dale, said last night that inflation may be slightly higher this year and next than the Bank had forecast last month, when it said the rate would drop below the 2% target by the end of the year. \"My own view is that the chances of inflation being above or below 2% by the end of this year and into 2013 are somewhat more balanced,\" he said in a speech at the University of Aberystwyth in Wales. \"One obvious worry ... is the possibility that tensions within the Middle East could escalate and put further upward pressure on oil prices.\" Alan Clarke, an economist at Scotiabank, flagged up pressures beyond oil prices and pointed out that core inflation, which excludes volatile elements such as energy, remained high. \"Higher oil prices aren't helping matters but it isn't just energy,\" he said. \"There are no longer any real excuses why core inflation is so high ... There is no longer any VAT effect to blame. In fact, the lagged effects of the rise in oil should feed through into higher air fares over the coming months. \"Similarly, higher food prices are likely to feed through into higher restaurant prices. The Olympics should exacerbate this and boost hotel prices.\" The headline rate of inflation is still well above the pace of average wage rises. The chancellor, George Osborne, presenting his budgeton Wednesday, will be hoping inflation comes down much further in coming months, boosting households' disposable incomes, reviving consumer spending and thereby shoring up the lacklustre economic recovery. The Office for National Statistics said the largest downward effects last month came from electricity and gas bills, which on average fell this year between January and February, having risen a year earlier. Inflation was also pushed down by digital camera price cuts, while dog food discounts drove a record drop in the pets components of the prices basket. The largest upward pressures came from rising alcohol prices \u2013 spirits in particular \u2013 and vegetables. With droughts predicted for areas of the UK in coming months, there are warnings that vegetable and other food prices will rise faster this year. Vicky Redwood, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said the downward trend in headline inflation could pause over the next couple of months. \"Indeed, inflation could even rise in March on the back of the continued rise in petrol prices. And a possible rise in food prices in response to the drought adds to the near-term upside risks to inflation,\" she said. But the thinktank still sees inflation coming down over the year as a whole. \"These factors should just slow the speed at which inflation falls, rather than preventing it dropping at all. We still think that inflation will be back below its target before the end of the year,\" added Redwood. There were further signs of upward pressures to come from Britain's manufacturers, with a majority reporting intentions to raise prices. The latest CBI survey of the sector also showed that orders deteriorated a little faster than expected in recent weeks but businesses were more upbeat about their future output.The CBI's chief economic adviser, Ian McCafferty, highlighted risks to the outlook, however. \"Any further rise in oil prices would be a significant concern, given the additional cost burden this would place on UK manufacturers and the knock-on effects it could have on the nascent recovery,\" he said.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Debenhams has announced good first-half results, raising hopes that consumer confidence is improving, although the new chief executive, Michael Sharp, said conditions on the high street remained \"tough\". The department store is the first of a number of retailers to post results this week, which should give a sense of how the high street has fared as government cuts take hold. Sharp said a strong January sale and a positive start to the spring helped lift like-for-like sales by 0.3% in the first half, despite the economic climate. \"There's been no material change in consumer confidence or the economic background,\" he said, \"And we're not anticipating any great changes. It remains tough.\" The company reported a \"resilient finish\" to the period, as like-for-like sales rose 2.4% in the eight weeks to 3 March. Sharp said Debenhams had fresh stock and strong marketing at just the right time, when shoppers stopped hunting for bargains and wanted something new for spring. \"The [rest of the] high street probably had a legacy of old season product during that time, so it didn't look as good.\" He said people had changed their shopping behaviour in the downturn. \"They may buy less items and buy better. They react strongly to promotional activity but they are searching for value, not just price.\" Debenhams has benefitted from the so-called lipstick effect, when consumers feeling the squeeze spend what little disposable income they have on smaller, luxury items such as expensive makeup. Health and beauty items made up a larger proportion of sales in the first half, which hit margins as they tend to be less profitable. That, combined with discounting in the January sales, led to a 0.3% drop in margins in the first half. The company still expects margins to remain unchanged over the course of the year. Online sales continued to outstrip the market, rising 35%, compared with 16% growth in e-commerce in the UK as a whole. Sharp said it was unclear what the impact of the diamond jubilee, the Olympics and the European football championships would be. \"There was a feel-good factor with the royal wedding last summer, so we hope we get the benefit of that. But we know that football can be disruptive. It distracts spending into burgers, alcohol and TVs and away from the high street.\" The company said it was comfortable with analyst forecasts for pre-tax profits of \u00a3157m for the full-year, down 2% on last year. Oriel Securities said: \"Debenhams has enjoyed a strong finish to the half, helped by a strong reaction to the new season's product and disciplined clearing of the post-Christmas sale. This is an encouraging close to the half and suggests that management's focus on improving the quality of the range is indeed paying off. This is a good start to Michael Sharp's tenure as CEO.\" The shares ticked up 1.5% to 76.85p. Looking ahead to Wednesday, Sharp said he hoped there would be more support from the government to help with youth unemployment in the budget, as that is \"vital for the longer term health of the economy\". He added: \"I'd also like to see business rates rising at the lower rate of inflation.\" Among the other retailers reporting this week, Sainsbury's is expected to post a 2% increase in like-for-like sales for the third quarter on Wednesday, as it capitalises on Tesco's woes. Zara-owner Inditex also posts results on Wednesday, followed by Kingfisher, which owns B&amp;Q, and Next on Thursday.",

It remains tough.\"</p> <p>The company reported a \"resilient finish\" to the period, as like-for-like sales rose 2.4% in the eight weeks to 3 March. Sharp said Debenhams had fresh stock and strong marketing at just the right time, when shoppers stopped hunting for bargains and wanted something new for spring. \"The [rest of the] high street probably had a legacy of old season product during that time, so it didn't look as good.\"</p> <p>He said people had changed their shopping behaviour in the downturn. \"They may buy less items and buy better. They react strongly to promotional activity but they are searching for value, not just price.\"</p> <p>Debenhams has benefitted from the so-called lipstick effect, when consumers feeling the squeeze spend what little disposable income they have on smaller, luxury items such as expensive makeup. Health and beauty items made up a larger proportion of sales in the first half, which hit margins as they tend to be less profitable. That, combined with discounting in the January sales, led to a 0.3% drop in margins in the first half. The company still expects margins to remain unchanged over the course of the year.</p> <p>Online sales continued to outstrip the market, rising 35%, compared with 16% growth in e-commerce in the UK as a whole.</p> <p>Sharp said it was unclear what the impact of the diamond jubilee, the Olympics and the European football championships would be. \"There was a feel-good factor with the royal wedding last summer, so we hope we get the benefit of that. But we know that football can be disruptive. It distracts spending into burgers, alcohol and TVs and away from the high street.\" The company said it was comfortable with analyst forecasts for pre-tax profits of \u00a3157m for the full-year, down 2% on last year.</p> <p>Oriel Securities said: \"Debenhams has enjoyed a strong finish to the half, helped by a strong reaction to the new season's product and disciplined clearing of the post-Christmas sale. This is an encouraging close to the half and suggests that management's focus on improving the quality of the range is indeed paying off. This is a good start to Michael Sharp's tenure as CEO.\" The shares ticked up 1.5% to 76.85p.</p> <p>Looking ahead to Wednesday, Sharp said he hoped there would be more support from the government to help with youth unemployment in the budget, as that is \"vital for the longer term health of the economy\". He added: \"I'd also like to see business rates rising at the lower rate of inflation.\"</p> <p>Among the other retailers reporting this week, Sainsbury's is expected to post a 2% increase in like-for-like sales for the third quarter on Wednesday, as it capitalises on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/mar/15/tesco-uk-boss-quits-profit-warning\" title=\"\">Tesco's woes</a>. Zara-owner Inditex also posts results on Wednesday, followed by Kingfisher, which owns B&amp;Q, and Next on Thursday.</p>",
