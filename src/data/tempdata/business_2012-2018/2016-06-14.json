      "bodyText": "Brexit fears stalk global markets? Only up to a point. Since the polls turned in leave\u2019s favour, the FTSE 100 index has lost 370 points, or 5.8%, but is still well above February\u2019s lows. The pound has fallen from $1.45 to $1.41 against the dollar, and from \u20ac1.28 to \u20ac1.26 against the euro. These are notable moves but they are not big enough to be called panicky. Meanwhile, Tuesday\u2019s record-breaking piece of market action \u2013 German 10-year bunds trading at a negative yield \u2013 was also being blamed on Brexit-inspired fears of a pan-European jolt to economic growth. But, again, one needs to tread carefully. German yields have been falling ever since the financial crisis of 2008. The march from 1% to zero started a year ago and (aside from low growth and low inflation in the eurozone) owes much to the European Central Bank\u2019s huge programme of quantitative easing, or buying bonds regardless of price. Brexit, to be fair, may have contributed something to the latest fall in German bond yields. But let\u2019s not overstate it. A fortnight ago, when a remain victory looked an 80% probability, investors were willing to receive 0.2% for 10 years to lend to the German government; now they are willing to pay 0.05% for the privilege. A line has been crossed, but we\u2019re talking small actual movements in prices. So, if one takes a step back from the non-existent mayhem, two conclusions are possible. First, investors are only mildly worried about Brexit and think the short-term economic consequences are either hard to predict or exaggerated. Alternatively, markets don\u2019t think it will happen. The guess here is that it\u2019s the second. Why? Cast your mind back to last summer when Greece\u2019s survival in the eurozone was in genuine doubt. The country\u2019s banks closed and financial markets fell into a proper swoon. Yet \u2013 in financial and economic terms \u2013 Greece was, and remains, a tiddler. Brexit, rather than Grexit, would represent a far bigger shock to the entire eurozone/EU project. No wonder the German political and financial establishment is pleading for the UK to remain. It would rather delay the day when the eurozone has to sign up to fiscal transfers \u2013 rich countries paying for poorer members \u2013 to ensure long-term survival. Treaty changes will be necessary and demands for referendums will only be encouraged by the UK\u2019s example. While one vote to leave the EU might be tolerable, two might lead to a deeper unravelling, especially if the next opt-out were to be a eurozone member such as the Netherlands. Have markets priced in such political risks? Almost certainly not. There has been a modest widening of bond spreads between Germany and so-called peripheral eurozone members, like Spain and Portugal, but faith remains high in the ECB\u2019s ability to do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to keep the show on the road. Maybe, in the long-run, a UK exit from the EU would have a bracing effect of the eurozone\u2019s attempts to cure its deep economic ills. That must be one possible script since eurozone politicians seem capable of collective action only when presented with a crisis. Just don\u2019t expect markets to display any such breezy confidence if they wake up to a leave vote on 24 June. If Grexit looked scary, Brexit raises bigger uncertainties. The past week\u2019s market action, one suspects, would look like a tea party. Shy Green comes out of his shell Hurrah, Sir Philip Green has \u201cgiven long and hard thought to the matter\u201d and decided to turn up to answer questions from MPs on Wednesday about \u201cthe very sad BHS story\u201d. He\u2019s still complaining about parliamentarians making up their minds before they\u2019ve heard the evidence but, never mind, he\u2019ll be there. But, please, Sir Philip, drop the parallel grumble about this being your \u201cfirst and only opportunity\u201d to tell your side of tale. You were free at any point since BHS\u2019s administration in April to give an account. You could have issued a statement, held a press conference, whatever you wished. You have never previously been shy about sharing your views. Well done, the MPs, for ensuring we hear them. Bookies need a nought to worry about Is the Gambling Commission getting tougher? Well, the financial penalties for disobeying anti-money laundering and responsible gambling rules are becoming bigger. Betfred received an \u00a3800,000 penalty on Tuesday. That \u2013 and an \u00a3880,000 hit to GalaCoral a few weeks ago \u2013 was a step up from the derisory \u00a3280,000 handed down to Paddy Power earlier in the year. All different cases, of course. But given the size of some of these firms, penalties of less than \u00a31m don\u2019t hurt. Add a zero and the commission might get noticed in boardrooms.",

      "bodyText": "Shares in London hit a fresh three-month low on Tuesday as Brexit worries swept through the City, wiping \u00a330bn off the value of blue-chip companies. The FTSE 100 index closed down 121 points at 5923, its lowest level since late February, and its fourth day of heavy falls. Across the continent investors suffered a similar fate as shares plunged on most bourses, taking losses on the Eurostoxx 600 over the last five days to \u20ac600bn. The pound also tumbled 1.2% to below $1.41, its lowest for two months, and the price of a barrel of oil fell $1 as concerns over the global economy sent investors rushing for havens. The FTSE index of top shares has now shed 378 points since last Wednesday, when Brexit fears began to mount on polls showing the leave campaign taking an unexpected lead. A survey by TNS consolidated fears that Britons will vote to quit the EU after it said leavers had a seven-point lead over those who want to remain. This came after a Guardian/ICM poll earlier in the week that gave the leave campaign a six-point lead. Mining shares were among the top fallers, reflecting fears that a demand for metals will decline in response to waning demand from a European economy hit by Brexit uncertainty Housebuilders such as Taylor Wimpey and Barratt Developments also saw their value tumble after analysts said they would be hit by a decline in the UK housing market if the Bank of England raised interest rates to prop up sterling. The pound has fallen by more than 12% since last November and could fall by anything between 15% and 30% after a vote to leave the EU, according to a range of economic forecasts. Mark Dampier, research director at the stockbroker Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \u201cThe stench of Brexit is stalking the streets of the City. The market is now at levels last seen in February, when the vote was announced. Back then the FTSE 100 bottomed at 5536.97. Given the opinion polls, the dramatic change seen in the betting odds and low sentiment in general towards world stockmarkets it seems quite possible we could see further falls as an increasing probability of Brexit is being priced in.\u201d Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, also said fear was gripping the markets \u2013 driving money into safer investments such as German bonds. \u201cYet another day in the red for European markets has seen fears surrounding a potential Brexit continue to restrain risk appetite. The flight to safety is clearly evident in the foreign exchange markets, with money moving out of European currencies and into distant havens such as the yen and dollar,\u201d he said. The yield on 10-year German bonds turned negative for the first time and the borrowing rate on British government bonds reached an all-time low. The yield for countries vulnerable to a Brexit suffered the opposite, with yields on 10-year Portuguese, Irish, Greek and Italian bonds up, increasing their borrowing costs and widening the gap between Europe\u2019s core and the periphery. \u201cYet another EU referendum poll has hammered home the increasing threat of a Brexit next week, with the TNS poll coming out heavily in favour of the UK leaving the EU today. What initially looked like an anomaly, has turned into the norm, with eight of the last 10 polls coming out in favour of a Brexit,\u201d Mahony said. The prospect of Europe being thrown into political crisis, as the EU president, Donald Tusk, hinted on Monday, has \u201cadded fuel to the fire\u201d for nervous investors, said Jasper Lawler, an analyst at CMC Markets. \u201cMarkets are already worried about slowing global growth and the inability of central bank policy to stem the decline. The 23 June EU referendum gives a specific date when all the market\u2019s troubles could come to a head,\u201d he said. \u201cShares and the pound are being shunned in favour of havens like German and British bonds, the yields of which have struck record lows. Expectations of weak global growth and ever-enduring easy monetary policy, likely to be reinforced at central bank meeting this week, is seeing a mass exit from equities and feeding demand for bonds, sending yields to record lows.\u201d",

The Competition and Markets Authority said: \u201cThe CMA is investigating a suspected breach of competition law by some price comparison websites that offer energy tariff comparisons in relation to paid online search advertising.\u201d But in a bizarre twist, the initial investigation by the industry regulator, Ofgem, has been switched to the CMA after Ofgem uncovered earlier dealings by its own staff with the comparison sites that could have called into question the impartiality of the investigation. Ofgem said it found that two or more of the comparison sites had, since 2010, \u201cbeen parties to an agreement or concerted practice relating to bidding and/or negative matching for search advertising which have as their object or effect the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition.\u201d These practices included \u201cagreements not to compete in relation to particular search terms used for the purposes of online search advertising\u201d. Negative matching is when an advertiser indicates to a search engine operator such as Google that it does not want its website to appear in the search results for specific keywords. Ofgem has not named the parties it is investigating in relation to the suspected collusion. But in a statement, comparison site uSwitch said: \u201cWe have supported Ofgem with information in relation to this matter and will provide the CMA with any further information, if asked. This case is currently at an information gathering phase as the Ofgem decision notice specifies. We have no further detail on the nature of the case.\u201d The issue was handed to the CMA after an initial investigation by the industry regulator Ofgem was at risk of being compromised by actions of Ofgem staff. Ofgem found its staff had, before the formal investigation begun, been in contact with the websites now under investigation, encouraging them to change their behaviour when it came to buying advertising on search engines such as Google. Once the investigation began, Ofgem realised its earlier activities could call into question the regulator\u2019s own impartiality. In a statement, Ofgem said: \u201cOfgem itself procured search advertising during the period under investigation in the course of publishing advice and information to promote the interests of consumers, one of our statutory functions. \u201cOfgem became aware of communications between Ofgem staff and representatives of some of the parties under investigation encouraging those parties to change their behaviour in relation to bidding on search advertising keywords relevant to Ofgem. These communications took place before the investigation was opened. \u201cOfgem considers that this could delay the progress of the case, for example if parties were to call into question Ofgem\u2019s impartiality in continuing with the case.\u201d The CMA said that it will decide in August whether to proceed with the investigation or to close it. It was revealed in June last year that Moneysupermarket and uSwitch had been asked by Ofgem to provide information regarding a separate investigation into commission rates they charge energy suppliers, but in March this year the investigation was closed with no further action. The CMA\u2019s wider investigation into energy markets \u2013 which critics fear has bowed to pressure from the \u201cbig six\u201d energy providers \u2013 will issue its final report on Friday 24 June, the day after the EU referendum.",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s stock market has hit a new three-month low as Brexit worries sweep through the City. The blue-chip FTSE 100 index has closed down 121 points at 5923, its lowest level since late February, and its fourth day of heavy falls. That wipes around \u00a330bn off its value. The Footsie has now shed 378 points since the start of trading on Thursday, when Brexit fears began to mount. That means a staggering \u00a398bn has been wiped off the value of Britain\u2019s biggest companies in four trading days. Sterling is also languishing at two-month lows; the pound has lost 1.1% against the US dollar to $1.4108 at pixel time. The TNS poll, showing a seven-point lead for the Leave campaign, sent shares down heavily in late trading. Mining shares are among the top fallers, reflecting fears about the global economy. Housebuilders such as Taylor Wimpey and Barratt Development also suffered falls; they would be hit by a decline in the UK housing market if the Bank of England raised interest rates to prop up sterling. The prospect of Britain voting to leave the EU next week also sparked big losses across Europe, sending markets to three-month lows. German DAX: down 1.5% French CAC: down 2.3% Spanish IBEX: down 1.9% Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, says fear is gripping the markets - driving money into save-havens such as German bonds. Yet another day in the red for European markets has seen fears surrounding a potential Brexit continue to restrain risk appetite. The flight to safety is clearly evident in the foreign exchange markets, with money moving out of European currencies and into distant havens such as the yen and dollar. With the news that Germany has joined the negative 10-year club, it is clear that investors are looking for a shelter from the storm that is moving in over the next two weeks. Yet another EU referendum poll has hammered home the increasing threat of a Brexit next week, with the TNS poll coming out heavily in favour of the UK leaving the EU today. What initially looked like an anomaly, has turned into the norm, with 8 of the last 10 polls coming out in favour of a Brexit. And on that note, I\u2019m wrapping up for day. Our politics liveblog has full action from the Referendum campaign. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW In other news, retail magnate Sir Philip Green has just announced that he will attend a parliamentary hearing tomorrow on the collapse of BHS. Green had threatened not to appear unless Frank Field, the chairman of the work and pensions committee, stepped down, and accused Field of trying to destroy his reputation. Now, though, Green has decided to give his side of the story. He\u2019ll have to explain why he sold BHS for \u00a31 to a man with no retail experience, how much he took out of the company during his ownership, and how he plans to help fix its pension black hole. Kick-off 9.15am sharp! The Brexit referendum has come at a tricky time for the global economy. Investors have been fretting for months about China\u2019s slowing economy, while the eurozone\u2019s weak recovery has been an ongoing sore. So the prospect of Europe being thrown into political crisis has \u201cadded fuel to the fire\u201d for nervous investors, says Jasper Lawler of CMC Markets. Markets are already worried about slowing global growth and the inability of central bank policy to stem the decline. The June 23 EU referendum gives a specific date when all the market\u2019s troubles could come to a head. Stocks and the British pound are being shunned in favour of havens like German and British bonds, the yields of which have struck new record lows. Expectations of weak global growth and ever-enduring easy monetary policy, likely to be reinforced at central bank meeting this week, is seeing a mass exit from equities and feeding demand for bonds, sending yields to record lows. The London stock market has now suffer four days of steady losses, as the City has become steadily consumed by the looming EU vote. Mihir Kapadia, CEO at Sun Global Investments, says the markets are being hit hard by Brexit uncertainty. \u2018\u2019The risk of a potential \u2018Brexit\u2019 is dominating global markets today as we enter the home straight towards the influential EU referendum vote on 23 June. Investors seem to have suddenly woken up to Brexit risk and have become nervous.... The London stock market has hit a new three-month low as it staggers towards the close with fresh losses. The FTSE 100 index of blue-chip shares just fell as low as 5944 points, a loss of 101 points today. Almost every share has lost ground. Mining group Anglo American is the worst performer, down 4.6%. Ouch. The pound just slipped below $1.41 for the first time in two months. The TNS poll, showed Leave holding a 7-point lead, is clearly weighting on the markets. Investors haven\u2019t been this worried about a sterling crisis since the aftermath of Lehman Brothers\u2019 collapse: The pound just took another knock, after the TNS polling company reported that the Leave campaign have a \u201csignificant lead\u201d in the run-up to the EU referendum. TNS says that Leave is on 47% of the vote, with Remain trailing at 40% (with 13% of voters still undecided). And sterling is now down one and a half cents, or 1%, at $1.411 - its lowest point of the day. Insiders at the European Central Bank have revealed they would publicly pledge to backstop financial markets, in partnership with the Bank of England, should Britain vote to leave the European Union. It\u2019s a clear signal that central bankers are preparing for Britain to shock the global markets and vote for Brexit. Reuters has the story. Here\u2019s a flavour: The preparations illustrate the heightened state of alert ahead of the June 23 referendum, which will help determine Britain\u2019s future in trade and world affairs and also shape the EU. The pound and euro have lost value on fears a Brexit could tip the 28-member bloc into recession. Such an announcement from the ECB would come on June 24 if an early-morning result showed that British voters had chosen to leave the EU, according to the sources. The aim is to underpin investor confidence across Europe and contain further market jitters. \u201cThere will be a statement to do whatever it takes to maintain adequate market liquidity,\u201d said one senior central bank official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The ECB\u2019s pledge would involve opening so-called swap lines with the Bank of England, allowing euros and sterling to be exchanged and effectively making unlimited funding in both currencies available to European banks, the sources said. Here\u2019s the full story: Exclusive: ECB would pledge to backstop markets after a Brexit - sources The US stock market has opened calmly, bring some order to proceedings after a volatile European session. The Dow Jones industrial average has dipped by 0.1%, or 15 points, while the Nasdaq index of tech stocks is up 0.2%. Investors may be keen to sit sight until the UK\u2019s referendum has been cleared up; and few believe the Federal Reserve could raise interest rates at this week\u2019s two-day meeting (which finishes tomorrow). Christopher Vecchio, currency analyst at DailyFX, says: With all the attention on the Brexit, the central bank meetings this week have seemed to take a back seat. This makes sense, though. If the Fed hikes, and there is a Brexit? The Fed will have to backtrack, which will cost them credibility Pro-Brexit economist Dr Gerard Lyons has written a piece for us, arguing that UK manufacturing could thrive outside the EU. Here\u2019s a flavour: In the future we can craft policy to suit domestic needs, not least the possibility of an industrial policy if we wanted it. We could directly help sectors. The US, never accused of not being free market, directly targets help to strategic sectors, like autos. So too could we if we wished. EU state aid rules prevent the ability to selectively help areas or sectors. Add in the need to abide by EU regional development criteria, and our hands are tied on regional policy too. More here: Our economics editor, Larry Elliott, says the Bank of England will be delighted that UK inflation remained at 0.3% last month. He explains: For the Bank of England, lower than expected inflation is a double bonus. On the one hand, it increases the spending power of households and so boosts growth. On the other, it provides greater wriggle room before the government\u2019s 2% inflation target comes under serious threat. With the referendum making the outlook so uncertain, the extra leeway will be extremely welcome in Threadneedle Street. Here\u2019s Larry\u2019s analysis: Here comes the US retail sales figures for May.... ...and they\u2019ve beaten expectations, with sales growing by 0.5% during the month. That suggests American consumers are continuing to spend, and haven\u2019t been spooked by the latest twists in the race to succeed president Obama, or by the Brexit campaign. However.... it\u2019s partly due to more expensive gasoline; fuel spending jumped by 2.1%, reflecting higher price at the pumps The boss of French insurance group Axa has gone public with his concerns about next week\u2019s referendum. Axa CEO Henri de Castries told a conference in Paris that the chances of Brexit are now \u201cextremely high\u201d. It would leave investors strugging to navigate \u201ca true landscape of uncertainties\u201d, he warned. De Castries added that the future is uncertain, even if Britain votes to stay in the EU (via Bloomberg): \u201cIf they remain, the situation isn\u2019t simple either, and this is underestimated by lots of people.\u201d Stresses in the financial markets have jumped to their highest level since late February: Times City hack Simon English highlights how the mood has changed: Britain\u2019s borrowing costs are also hitting fresh all-time lows today. The yield on UK 10-year gilts has slid to just 1.15% \u2013 which is the lowest borrowing rate on record. That\u2019s a sharp fall from the 1.21% yield yesterday. [yields, or interest rates, fall when the price of a bond rises] At the start of 2015, Britain was paying 2% to borrow for a decade. Leave campaigner Douglas Carswell claims that this shows that investors are relaxed about the prospect of Britain quitting the EU.... However, falling bond yields is usually a sign that the City is worried \u2013 buying bonds as a way of protecting their cash. David Miller, investment director at fund manager Quilter Cheviot, says the markets are worried about the referendum , rather than \u201clooking good\u201d.... Markets are in a strange state. Gilt yields are lower than any time since records began in 1729 and companies are issuing huge amounts of corporate debt in order to take advantage of low interest rates. Short term traders and long term investors are on the sidelines waiting for the referendum result. Referendum uncertainty is damaging confidence and there is evidence of a slowdown in economic activity. Markets and social media amplify the daily headlines created by the politicians. London\u2019s stock market is plumbing new lows as traders continue to quake in the shadow of the EU vote. The FTSE 100 has shed 77 points, or 1.3%, to 5967 \u2013 falling through the 6,000 point mark for the first time since late February. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets says stock market bulls are racing to the exits, before the UK makes its own exit decision: \u201cEquity indices are extending their losses, fearful of a now heightened prospect that the UK votes to leave the European Union, worsening an already fragile global growth situation by delivering an economic and political blow to a struggling Eurozone. And Chris Beauchamp of IG says traders are reacting to the latest polls, and the Sun newspaper\u2019s decision to back the Leave campaign. Panic appears to be gripping markets as the headlines fill up with references to a possible Brexit, with the Sun\u2019s declaration for Brexit emblematic of the worry that the Remain campaign has lost a crucial segment of the population.... The move in the polls has been matched by a noticeable shift in the IG Brexit binary, with clients now thinking that the chance of the UK voting to leave has now hit 40.5%, up from the low 30s yesterday. A Brexit isn\u2019t fully priced in, though, Beauchamp adds: What is interesting is, despite the sharp selloff in sterling in recent days, the pound is still holding on above $1.41.. Either this is a symptom of limited volumes as traders abandon the field, or a sign that the market still thinks the status quo will win out in the end. European stock markets are also deep in the red. France\u2019s CAC is down 1.2%, while the German DAX is down 0.7%, as traders continue to dump shares and buy bonds (which is why German 10-year bond yields are now negative) This chart shows why Brexit would have such an impact on the European political landscape: Breaking: The Bank of England had allocated almost \u00a32.5bn of cash to City firms to help them handle any Brexit-related panic. This is the result of the first special liquidity operation run by the BoE, ahead of next week\u2019s EU referendum. The auction was designed to prevent the money markets running dry, if panic broke out over the referendum. Banks can swap assets for ready cash, and only have to repay the funds in six months. But the take-up is actually quite modest, and the lowest for any such market operation since February. Last week, for example, firms took around \u00a33.2bn of liquidity via a regular operation. Reuters has the details: BANK OF ENGLAND SAYS ALLOTS \u20ac2.455BN IN PRE-REFERENDUM INDEXED LONG-TERM REPO BANK OF ENGLAND REPO RESULTS SHOW BIDS RECEIVED FROM BANKS AND FUNDS ALLOTTED LOWEST SINCE FEB 2016 So, this suggests the City is still operating as normal, despite the recent tumble in the pound and in share prices. Here\u2019s some instant reaction, from Sky News\u2019s Ed Conway: And from private equity firm Pegasus: The inflation report didn\u2019t have much impact on the pound, which is still down around 1% against the US dollar. Joshua Raymond of City broker XTB.com says next week\u2019s EU referendum is still dominating the markets. May\u2019s inflation reading is unlikely to have any impact at the Bank of England, who remain expected to keep interest rates on hold for the remainder of the year. As such, the reaction to this data in the pound was minimal, and the main driver for pound buyers or sellers right now continues to be the uncertainty over a potential Brexit, with the latest polls showing a strengthening in popularity for the leave camp. With inflation this low, there\u2019s no chance that the Bank of England will raise interest rates when policymakers meet on Thursday. Ian Stewart, chief economist at Deloitte, reckons borrowing costs will remain extremely low for many months: \u201cInflation is up from its all-time lows but is still way too low. The fight against low inflation continues. The era of ultra-low interest rates has much further to run. Maike Currie, investment director for personal investing at Fidelity International, has summed up today\u2019s inflation data: \u201cAfter falling to 0.3% in April, inflation remains unchanged in May, below the 15-month peak of 0.5% recorded in March this year. Rising oil prices pushing up the cost of filling up your petrol tank coupled with eating out at restaurants and the price of smartphone services were the main upward drivers. This was offset by falls in clothing and food prices. Since the beginning of the year, the pound has been markedly weaker, which is also likely to have pushed up prices. UK house price inflation has also slowed down, perhaps reflecting economic uncertainty ahead of the EU referendum. The ONS reports that the cost of average house rose by 8.2% annually in April, down from 8.5% in March. Prices rose fastest in London (+14.5%) and the East of England (13.6%), but only rose by 0.1% in the North East. And there are some stark regional differences, with the Welsh town of Merthyr Tydfil suffering the biggest fall in house prices. The inflation report also shows that UK consumers have been hit by the recent recovery in the oil price. Transport costs climbed 0.9% in May, partly due to a 3p rise in a litre of diesel. Rising sea fares also had an upward impact, picking up slightly in 2016 after falling a year ago. Clothing and footwear prices fell by 0.2% between April and May this year, helping to keep the cost of living low. The downward contribution came from a variety of clothing but particularly children\u2019s outerwear. Food and non-alcoholic beverage prices fell by 0.4% between April and May 2016. The downward contribution came from a variety of food product groups, most notably vegetables and confectionery. Recreation and culture prices, fell by 0.4%: The downward contribution came mainly from games, toys and hobbies (particularly computer games) with prices falling between April and May 2016 compared with a rise last year. At just 0.3%, Britain\u2019s inflation rate remains stubbornly low below the Bank of England\u2019s 2% target. Breaking: The UK inflation rate remained at 0.3% in May, below the 0.4% expected by the City. That matches April\u2019s reading for the consumer prices index. The Office for National Statistics says the clothing and footwear, recreation and culture and food and beverages had the largest downward pressure on the inflation rate. Transport, restaurants and hotels and communication services had the largest upward pressures. More details and reaction to follow... The deputy chief of the International Monetary Fund has warned that Brexit would damage trade and hurt the global economy. David Lipton, first deputy managing director of the IMF, told a press conference in Beijing that the referendum comes at a difficult time for the world economy. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to anticipate what those effects [of Brexit] may be, that uncertainty would be a negative factor and come at a time when the global recovery remains slow and somewhat weak. That kind of uncertainty would be unhelpful.\u201d Ouch. The FTSE 100 has now tumbled below the 6,000 mark for the first time since February 25. The index has shed 50 points this morning, or 0.8%, to 5994 points. Banks, building firms and miners are leading the selloff, while only four blue-chip shares index have risen: FXTM chief market strategist Hussein Sayed confirms that investors are racing to safe-haven assets: Markets anxiety was clearly reflected in CBOE\u2019s volatility index \u201cVIX\u201d, which climbed above 20 for the first time since late February, indicating that investors are now taking the vote more seriously than in the past couple of weeks, and accordingly are adjusting their portfolios. European stock markets have hit their lowest levels since last February, as Brexit fears stalk the trading floors. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 has shed 34 points in early trading, down 0.5% at 6010. And there are deeper losses in other markets; the French CAC has lost 1.2% and the German DAX is down 0.9%. Conner Campbell of SpreadEx says pre-referendum fears are growing. The latest Guardian/ICM survey has the Leave campaign with a 6 point advantage, with polls from the ORB/Telegraph and YouGov/Times suggesting similar leads for Boris Johnson and co. Perhaps most damning is the fact that The Sun this morning came out in favour of a Brexit with a flashy and trashy editorial on the reason why Britain should quit the EU. The Brexiters have begun to dominate the conversation at the key time, and as shown by the market reaction there is a genuine fear that Europe is on a collision course with history. Boom! Germany\u2019s 10-year bond yield has just turned negative as investors scramble to buy debt issued by Europe\u2019s largest member. This means they are effectively paying to lend to Berlin for a decade, in another sign that fear is gripping the markets today. In another sign of market angst, the interest rates on Britain\u2019s government debt has hit a record low. The price of a UK 10-year gilt has hit record highs this morning, as money pours into government debt. And that has driven down the interest rates (or yield) on the debt to just 1.187%. You could argue that this is a sign of optimism in the UK. But I think it actually shows that investors are worried, and piling into safe assets -- as other government bonds are also hitting record highs. The Bank of England is preparing to pump billions of pounds into the UK financial sector today. This is the first of three special scheduled liquidity auctions planned around the EU referendum on 23 June. It will allow financial institutions to get their hands on cash, by swapping assets such as mortgages loans. The idea is to prevent the money markets seizing up, if worried banks are reluctant to trade with each other. The BoE usually holds such auctions, called Additional Indexed Long-Term Repo operations (ILTRs), once a month. These three extra auctions are meant to avoid turmoil breaking out in the markets (as we reported earlier this month). We\u2019re expecting to get the results around 10.40am. They will show just how worried the City is about a potential Brexit. Sterling is starting the morning on the back foot, as traders digest reports of rising panic inside Downing Street about the EU referendum. The pound has dropped by over one cent against the US dollar, to $1.4149. That\u2019s close to the two-month low hit yesterday morning (before sterling curiously bounced back). Against the euro, the pound is down half a percent at \u20ac1.2561. Sterling has also hit a three-year low against the Japanese currency. It now only buys 150 yen, compared with more than 190 a year ago. The yen is strengthening generally today, as investors race into safe-haven currencies. Yesterday, a Guardian/ICM poll showed that the Leave campaign now hold a five-point lead. That has helped to spark serious alarm among remain campaigners that Britain could be on the verge of voting to leave the EU. The news that Britain\u2019s most popular newspaper (which like to pin its colours to a winning horse) is backing Brexit is also hitting the pound: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u2019s Inflation Tuesday, the time when we find out how the cost of living changed in the UK in the last month. Fuel prices probably picked up in May, due to the rise in crude oil prices. But consumers have also benefitted from falling clothing prices. The data comes at 9.30am GMT, along with house price inflation figures for April. Economists predict that the consumer prices index rose by 0.4%, up from 0.3% a month ago. That would take us a little closer to the official 2% target \u2013 and a strong reading might, usually, reignite talk of interest rate hikes. But these are not normal times, of course. The EU referendum is just nine days away, so the City is getting increasingly agitated about the prospect of Brexit. The pound is taking the brunt of this, being buffeted by the latest opinion polls which have shown a steady move towards leaving the EU. Analysts expect a lot more volatility over the next few weeks. And that\u2019s why the Bank of England is offering the City fresh liquidity today, to help them handle any turmoil (more on that in a moment). Also coming up: The latest eurozone industrial production figures, at 10am BST US retail sales at 1.30pm BST Investors are also bracing for central bank action this week, with the US Federal Reserve setting monetary policy on Wednesday, followed by the Bank of Japan and the BoE on Thursday. So it could be another volatile day....",

      "bodyText": "Sir Philip Green has confirmed he will appear before MPs investigating the demise of BHS on Wednesday despite concerns about receiving a \u201cfair hearing\u201d. The former BHS owner, who sold the retail group for \u00a31 to a little known group of investors led by serial bankrupt Dominic Chappell, about a year before it collapsed into administration, said: \u201cThis will be the first and only opportunity I have had to tell my side of the very sad BHS story and I will do my best to answer all the questions put to me in an honest and open way.\u201d On Saturday, Green said he would not attend parliament unless Frank Field, the chair of the work and pensions committee, which is investigating BHS, stepped down. It was also reported that Michael Sherwood, the joint head of investment bank Goldman Sachs in Europe would also appear before the MPs. Field, a former welfare minister, has been critical of Green and said his committee \u201cwould laugh\u201d if the billionaire were to offer less than \u00a3600m to settle the former retail chain\u2019s pension debts when he goes before the committee. BHS\u2019s pension fund has a deficit of more than \u00a3571m on one measure and requires at least \u00a3275m to keep it out of the pensions lifeboat. Scheme members who have not already retired will receive only 90% of their future pensions under the PPF and will not get more unless a deal can be struck to pump more than \u00a3275m into the scheme. The tycoon is thought to be working on a deal in which he would offer to buy out pensioners who had only worked for BHS for a short period of time \u2013 and so built up very small pension pots \u2013 and pump further funds into the scheme. Such a solution would mean he could rescue the scheme for less than the top of the range \u00a3571m. Green suggested over the weekend that Field\u2019s continued participation in the inquiry would only \u201cobstruct a resolution\u201d. He added: \u201cI am not prepared to participate in a process which has not even the pretence of fairness and objectivity and which has as its primary objective the destruction of my reputation.\u201d Field has refused to step down and his position has been backed by a number of MPs including business minister Anna Soubry, who said on Twitter: \u201cSir Philip needs to understand parliament is the boss, get a grip.\u201d In a statement issued on Tuesday, Green said: \u201cI am disappointed not to have had a reply to either of my letters sent to Mr Field. I did not think or believe that those conducting a parliamentary process would or should express concluded views in such a public way before I have had the chance to appear before the committee.\u201d But he added: \u201cHaving given long and hard thought to the matter however, I have decided I will attend tomorrow morning, hoping and trusting that the committee will give me a fair hearing.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A Goldman Sachs banker procured the services of two prostitutes for $600 a night in an attempt to win business from a cash-rich investment fund set up by the Gaddafi regime, the high court in London has been told. Further detail of the alleged involvement of sex workers in winning business for the investment bank \u2013 one of the prostitutes was said to be called Michella \u2013 was revealed on the second day of a case in which the Libyan Investment Authority is claiming $1.2bn (\u00a3847m) from Goldman Sachs over nine loss-making trades that took place between January and April 2008. Goldman is defending the case, which was first tabled in 2014, and argues that the LIA lost out on its nine trades because of \u201cunforeseen financial depression, not of any wrongdoing\u201d by the bank. The particulars of the prostitutes had been recovered from the BlackBerry of a Goldman banker, Youseff Kabbaj, whom the court had been told on Monday was a key contact with the LIA. Roger Masefield, QC for the LIA, told the court he would not read out the \u201csalacious\u201d detail in the text exchanges, in which he tries to haggle down the price and asks her to bring along an equally good-looking friend . The allegation is that the services of the sex workers were bought by Kabbaj as he attempted to get closer to Haitem Zarti, the brother of a senior official at the LIA. Masefield said Kabbaj was forming links with Zarti to win business for Goldman from the LIA. The court had been told on Monday that Goldman had agreed a paid internship for Zarti, which Masefield said was intended to influence decisions by the investment fund. Goldman said this is not the case. Robert Miles, QC for Goldman, addressing Mrs Justice Rose for the first time, said: \u201cWe say that this truly is a case of buyers\u2019 remorse.\u201d The LIA had expected to make large profits on the nine trades on companies such as electricity company EDF and US bank Citigroup. But, Miles said:\u201cThe underlying stocks tanked. What it [the LIA] seeks to do with this claim is to get its money back for an investment which turned out badly for it\u201d. Miles also said that contrary to the arguments being put forward by the LIA, officials at the fund had been shown the complexity of the transactions in which they were getting involved and had selected the companies in which they wanted exposure. He began setting out Goldman\u2019s defence after the court was shown the texts about the prostitute, which Masefield said were in the recovery file on Kabbaj\u2019s BlackBerry, and sent on 24 February 2008 when he and Zarti were in Dubai. Kabbaj is not being called to give evidence, the court has been told, because of a settlement agreement with the bank over a $4.5m bonus in 2008. Masefield said the text messages showed that Kabbaj had also forwarded the details of the prostitute to Zarti later. Zarti had replied he was \u201cgetting back to God\u2019s way and it was too late and he wanted to sleep,\u201d Masefield said. The prostitutes were hired after Kabbaj and Zarti had flown into Dubai from Morocco to attend a conference, according to Masefield. \u201cHaitem Zarti\u2019s business-class flights to Dubai were paid for by Goldman Sachs, as was his accommodation in the five-star Ritz Carlton.\u201d Even though Zarti was not an LIA official, he had been showered with corporate hospitality, Masefield said. Masefield told the court the profits being made by Goldman on the trades with the LIA were so large that Lloyd Blankfein, chief executive of the firm, had raised questions on 27 April 2008 while on a trip to Abu Dhabi. One Goldman executive emailed another: \u201cArm us my friend with the details so we can get back to Lloyd. We are seeing him again at 9am. Keep this email to yourself\u201d. Witnesses are called this week. Among those to provide witness statements are Sofia Wellesley, the wife of the singer James Blunt, who used to work as a PA at the LIA. It is not yet clear if she will be called to give evidence.",

Zarti had replied he was \u201cgetting back to God\u2019s way and it was too late and he wanted to sleep,\u201d Masefield said.</p> <p>The prostitutes were hired after Kabbaj and Zarti had flown into Dubai from Morocco to attend a conference, according to Masefield. \u201cHaitem Zarti\u2019s business-class flights to Dubai were paid for by Goldman Sachs, as was his accommodation in the five-star Ritz Carlton.\u201d</p> <p>Even though Zarti was not an LIA official, he had been showered with corporate hospitality, Masefield said.</p> <p>Masefield told the court the profits being made by Goldman on the trades with the LIA were so large that Lloyd Blankfein, chief executive of the firm, had raised questions on 27 April 2008 while on a trip to Abu Dhabi. </p> <p>One Goldman executive emailed another: \u201cArm us my friend with the details so we can get back to Lloyd. We are seeing him again at 9am. Keep this email to yourself\u201d.</p> <p>Witnesses are called this week. Among those to provide witness statements are Sofia Wellesley, the wife of the singer James Blunt, who used to work as a PA at the LIA. It is not yet clear if she will be called to give evidence.</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A UK vote to leave the EU would disrupt imports of bricks, timber and kitchens from continental Europe, the boss of the housebuilding firm Crest Nicholson has said. Stephen Stone, the company\u2019s chief executive, said ceramic tiles from Spain or a Bosch washing machine would be harder and more expensive to obtain. By harming imports of building materials and ending the flow of foreign workers, a UK exit from the EU would slow down construction, worsening the housing crisis. \u201cAs a business, we\u2019d be disappointed if Brexit were to happen,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a period where we are growing as an industry, and it would be a shame to put that at risk.\u201d During the financial crisis and recession, Crest halved its 800-strong workforce, but it now employs 850 people, including 90 apprentices. Stone said leaving the EU would put the apprenticeship programme at risk because \u201cwe would stop recruitment\u201d. He noted that a lot of building materials were imported: bricks and blocks from Belgium; ceramic tiles, bathrooms and kitchen components from Spain; and white goods come from Spain and Germany. \u201cWe have strong relationships with our European suppliers,\u201d Stone said. \u201cBelgium and Spain would still be keen to trade, but clearly Brexit is going to take a few years to negotiate.\u201d The pound is expected to fall sharply if next week\u2019s referendum results in a leave vote. This would increase the cost of building materials, bathrooms and kitchens, according to Crest\u2019s finance director, Patrick Bergin. But he highlighted the \u201cdisturbance factor\u201d as the main risk. Crest\u2019s comments came as opinion polls continued to shift towards a leave vote. Economists at Berenberg Bank rate the probability of an exit at 42%, compared with 20% in late May. Stone said: \u201cAs a prudent business we would probably pause. It means restricting investment in land and in people. We would review it in three or six months\u2019 time.\u201d Like others in the industry, Crest warned of shortages of construction workers if the leave campaign prevailed. The industry has always relied on foreign workers to plug skill gaps \u2013 from Irish labourers to Polish plumbers. In some areas, such as concrete frame construction in Suffolk and Norfolk, an estimated 40% of workers come from eastern Europe. Crest reported a 25% rise in profit before tax to \u00a372.6m in the six months to 30 April. Revenues increased 22% to \u00a3408.1m. Crest built 1,206 homes, 7% more than a year earlier. It raised its half-year dividend by 42% to 9.1p a share. However, Stone said the company was having to work much harder to sell homes priced between \u00a3750,000 and \u00a31.5m in central London, blaming Brexit fears and affordability issues. Prices have been stagnating for a year after a period of rapid growth. Jefferies analyst Sam Cullen said: \u201cCrest Nicholson has become the first UK housebuilder to voice concerns and to disclose facts suggesting a London slowdown. Overall trading (the walk) remains robust, but the talk was weighted towards London, possible Brexit and bends in the road. \u201cIn the event of a leave vote they may stop buying land for three months and then re-assess. If the \u2018bend\u2019 in the road is more severe than they currently think they will push the brake pedal somewhat harder.\u201d Crest, like others, is pushing into the \u201cbuild to rent\u201d market. The company won planning permission for its first purpose-designed, suburban private rental sector scheme. It is building 227 homes in partnership with fund manager M&amp;G at Faygate near Gatwick airport. Stone said the project was inspired by the American family housing model and that the company was considering a similar scheme in Bristol.",

    "webTitle": "Brexit would help UK manufacturing survive in a global market", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Manufacturing matters and Brexit can help. Although a service sector economy, UK manufacturing is vital in achieving balanced and regional growth and reducing the large trade deficit. Strong global influences are challenging manufacturing, not least low-cost producers led by China. These will continue, whatever the referendum outcome. But Brexit provides greater flexibility to cope and position for the future. There is a reason why our internationally competitive manufacturing companies such as JCB and Dyson support Brexit. To survive and compete the UK has to expose itself to international competition and needs to focus on selling into the fast growing markets of the future. The alternative of remaining protected behind the tariff wall and regulations of the EU makes companies flabby and less competitive in global markets. Yes, there are many big firms who want to remain in the EU. Not only do those big firms have the ability to lobby Brussels but they all too often focus on the short term and their next quarter\u2019s results. For once we need to think long term and about what positions us best for future investment, jobs and growth. Brexit would probably lead to a weaker pound and lower rates. In a low inflation global environment this would be good for manufacturing. But it is much more than this. It is not always appreciated the extent to which the UK has moved into higher end manufacturing, dependent on high value added, not low wages. This makes sense and needs to continue. We can compete either on price or on quality, and while we need to be competitive we must avoid a race to the bottom. It is no good for productivity or wages. EU membership has not helped us address our productivity challenge. High-quality production is the focus, but it requires us to compete internationally and we can only do that properly outside the EU. People often say: \u201cBut look at look at Germany.\u201d Apart from the obvious need for us to invest more like them, the reality is the euro has crippled industry elsewhere in the EU, while the EU expansion to the east has allowed Germany to hollow-out the expensive parts of their supply chains. If we stay in the EU our hands are tied. Take steel. Despite the media stories at the time about dumping and tariffs, the key issue was that this hi-tech sector with modern working practices could not be supported or protected when needed. Take energy policy. All too often firms here complain about the cost of EU energy policy and how it puts us at a disadvantage. We kid ourselves we are environmentally friendly and end up exporting the pollution, and no doubt some jobs, to Asia. Leaving the EU will allow a sensible energy policy, a key input cost for firms. Likewise, many EU regulations are seen as a big problem by many small- and medium-sized firms. Brexit also allows the flexibility to reverse poor regulations, unlike the EU, where once in place they are impossible to remove. Naturally, many regulations will stay and, sensibly, workers rights are enshrined in UK law. In the future we can craft policy to suit domestic needs, not least the possibility of an industrial policy if we wanted it. We could directly help sectors. The US, never accused of not being free market, directly targets help to strategic sectors, like autos. So too could we if we wished. EU state aid rules prevent the ability to selectively help areas or sectors. Add in the need to abide by EU regional development criteria, and our hands are tied on regional policy too. The country needs to innovate, invest and spend on infrastructure. The latter has been a failure of policy, nothing to do with the EU. Yet if we were to leave we have greater flexibility on infrastructure and could decide to award more contracts to UK firms, if we so chose. But what about trade? Within the EU it is not always appreciated how poor the EU is at conducting trade deals, and when they do the UK\u2019s demands are just one of 28 countries. It is perhaps just as well that a trade deal is not necessary to trade. This is often overlooked. Thirty-six non-EU countries have seen faster export growth than us into the single market. This highlights once again that you do not need to be in the single market to sell into it. And as the strength of our auto sector shows, many of the big future opportunities are global.

Although a service sector economy, UK manufacturing is vital in achieving balanced and regional growth and reducing the large trade deficit.</p> <p>Strong global influences are challenging manufacturing, not least low-cost producers led by China. These will continue, whatever the referendum outcome. But Brexit provides greater flexibility to cope and position for the future.</p> <p>There is a reason why our <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/10/mrs-camerons-diary-brexit-dave\">internationally competitive manufacturing companies such as JCB</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/11/sir-james-dyson-dismisses-brexit-trade-fears-as-cobblers\">Dyson support Brexit</a>. To survive and compete the UK has to expose itself to international competition and needs to focus on selling into the fast growing markets of the future.</p> <p>The alternative of remaining protected behind the tariff wall and regulations of the EU makes companies flabby and less competitive in global markets. Yes, there are many big firms who want to remain in the EU. Not only do those big firms have the ability to lobby Brussels but they all too often focus on the short term and their next quarter\u2019s results.</p> <p>For once we need to think long term and about what positions us best for future investment, jobs and growth.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/11/sir-james-dyson-dismisses-brexit-trade-fears-as-cobblers\">Sir James Dyson dismisses Brexit trade fears as 'cobblers'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Brexit would probably lead to a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/14/would-the-pound-be-weakened-by-brexit\">weaker pound</a> and lower rates. In a low inflation global environment this would be good for manufacturing. But it is much more than this.</p> <p>It is not always appreciated the extent to which the UK has moved into higher end manufacturing, dependent on high value added, not low wages. This makes sense and needs to continue. We can compete either on price or on quality, and while we need to be competitive we must avoid a race to the bottom. It is no good for productivity or wages. EU membership has not helped us address our productivity challenge. High-quality production is the focus, but it requires us to compete internationally and we can only do that properly outside the EU.</p> <p>People often say: \u201cBut look at <a href=\"https://www.asme.org/engineering-topics/articles/manufacturing-processing/how-does-germany-do-it\">look at Germany.</a>\u201d Apart from the obvious need for us to invest more like them, the reality is the euro has crippled industry elsewhere in the EU, while the EU expansion to the east has allowed Germany to hollow-out the expensive parts of their supply chains.</p> <p>If we stay in the EU our hands are tied. Take <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/20/how-the-uk-steel-crisis-unfolded\">steel.</a> Despite the media stories at the time about dumping and tariffs, the key issue was that this hi-tech sector with modern working practices could not be supported or protected when needed. Take energy policy. All too often firms here complain about the cost of EU energy policy and how it puts us at a disadvantage. We kid ourselves we are environmentally friendly and end up exporting the pollution, and no doubt some jobs, to Asia.</p> <p>Leaving the EU will allow a sensible energy policy, a key input cost for firms. Likewise, many EU regulations are seen as a big problem by many small- and medium-sized firms. Brexit also allows the flexibility to reverse poor regulations, unlike the EU, where once in place they are impossible to remove. Naturally, many regulations will stay and, sensibly, workers rights are enshrined in UK law.</p> <p>In the future we can craft policy to suit domestic needs, not least the possibility of an industrial policy if we wanted it.</p> <p>We could directly help sectors. The US, never accused of not being free market, directly targets help to strategic sectors, like autos. So too could we if we wished. EU state aid rules prevent the ability to selectively help areas or sectors. Add in the need to abide by EU regional development criteria, and our hands are tied on regional policy too.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/14/would-the-pound-be-weakened-by-brexit\">Would the pound be weakened by Brexit?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The country needs to innovate, invest and spend on infrastructure. The latter has been a failure of policy, nothing to do with the EU. Yet if we were to leave we have greater flexibility on infrastructure and could decide to award more contracts to UK firms, if we so chose.</p> <p>But <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/will-brexit-damage-trade-eu-referendum-vote-leave-a7062201.html\">what about trade?</a> Within the EU it is not always appreciated how poor the EU is at conducting trade deals, and when they do the UK\u2019s demands are just one of 28 countries. It is perhaps just as well that a trade deal is not necessary to trade. This is often overlooked. Thirty-six non-EU countries have seen faster export growth than us into the single market. This highlights once again that you do not need to be in the single market to sell into it. And as the strength of our auto sector shows, many of the big future opportunities are global.</p> <ul> <li><em>Gerard Lyons is a member of <a href=\"http://www.economistsforbrexit.co.uk/\">Economists for Brexit</a>.

      "bodyText": "So, \u201cKing\u201d Phil Green, retail wide boy, is still refusing to give evidence to MPs on the Commons business, information and skills (BIS) select committee over how he offloaded BHS on to a passing ex-bankrupt for a quid. Ahead of Wednesday\u2019s standoff the MPs are preparing sanctions. But who is bluffing? In reality both sides are engaged in brinkmanship. But King Phil is the one most likely to blink first and appear at Westminster, if not sooner, then later. He has a lot more than his mud-stained Blair knighthood to lose and has very few friends left. When the Daily Mail gets on your case it is time to start checking out options for asylum. Parts of Saudi Arabia can be lovely in the winter months. That said, the MPs have to be careful not to push their luck and stumble into deep waters that may drown them. Frank Field, Labour chair of the Commons works and pensions committee, which is cooperating over the BHS scandal with the cross-party BIS team (chair: Labour\u2019s Ian Wright), was unwise to threaten Green as he did. It gave the tax-shy tycoon an excuse to say that the committee, which wants him to fill the BHS pension hole with up to \u00a3600m of his own dubiously gotten gains, is biased against him before hearing the defence. I think that could be said of most people reading what has already emerged about the BHS sale. But most of us are not acting in a quasi-judicial capacity. In theory a British parliamentary select committee enjoys the historical right to call for \u201cpersons, papers and records\u201d and those who refuse could be guilty of contempt of parliament and punished. It\u2019s all laid out very well in this Commons library briefing paper, updated this month, which makes clear that reform of the ancient practice has been discussed \u2013 and repeatedly stalled. In the 18th century those held in contempt could be imprisoned \u2013 in a tower at the Lords end, as I recall \u2013 or fined. But both penalties died out after being challenged in the courts. The last fine was levied in 1866 and the last person summoned to explain himself at the Bar of the Commons \u2013 that white line you can see on TV in the carpet \u2013 was John Junor, editor of the Sunday Express, in 1957. Junor had accused MPs of trousering unfair amounts of petrol during the rationing caused by the Suez crisis, but handled himself so well that the MPs dropped that sanction too. Happy days! Since the reforms triggered by another expenses row in 2009, one of the few undisputed successes of parliament has been the beefed-up select committee system with more expert and independent chairmen, elected by all MPs, not by the party whips. Andrew Tyrie, the cerebral Tory who chairs the Treasury select committee (he declared for remain on Tuesday), has made bankers weep with his acerbic and probing questions. But there are others worthy of praise including Field and Wright, and Tory Sarah Wollaston, the GP who chairs health. It\u2019s a promising development on all our behalfs. Just look what the BIS team got out of those BHS executives last week! In light of their greater activism, the most recent attempt to update the committees\u2019 power of punishment \u2013 one of several in recent years \u2013 offered the Commons and the government the choice of a Parliamentary Privileges Act which would give peers and MPs the statutory power to fine recalcitrants on their collective say so, or a new criminal offence of contempt of parliament which would hand the job to the high court, on the application of someone like the attorney general. A green (discussion) paper was published in 2012 and there the issue remains. None of this is straightforward. When the Murdochs, father and son, and their henchfolk were summoned in 2012 to discuss phone hacking, they resisted but eventually buckled. Informal punishment was meted out by a pie thrower. More recently, Mike Ashley of Sports Direct also initially refused to appear and then after acquiesced. But the ever scholarly Joshua Rozenberg pointed out at the time of the Murdochs\u2019 summons, what MPs can threaten witnesses with (and even the privilege their evidence has from libel proceedings) is disputed by serious lawyers. His summary is a good read for would-be backbench grandstanders. TAKE CARE. As I understand it, much of the problem arises from process and the rights of an accused. Witnesses do not normally bring along their lawyers (as they do in the highly legalistic US Congress) and to allow them to do so would require MPs to have other lawyers to keep them in check as they struggled to prevent their client incriminating themselves. It would raise the stakes and the costs. Anything less than fairness might end up in the courts, not to mention fall foul of the You Know Where\u2019s Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). But parliament and the courts have kept a wary distance between their respective activities for 300 years, ever since the Act of Settlement (1701) which prevented politicians \u2013 they had newly deposed King James II in mind \u2013 from sacking judges they didn\u2019t like, Donald Trump style. So when the UK\u2019s supreme court was removed from the body of the House of Lords across Parliament Square to its own building \u2013 a Blair-era reform \u2013 parliament was careful not to give it the kind of power the US supreme court or Germany\u2019s constitutional court enjoy, to strike down legislation as unconstitutional. That would be going too far, chaps! Constitutional reformer Anthony Barnett has an interesting essay here on the bigger can of constitutional worms that the 23 June referendum may/not open. Let\u2019s not go there today, it\u2019s a notoriously unBritish subject. One last thought. By the time you read this King Phil may well have buckled and agreed to appear. But there remains a significant body of citizens whom select committees will still be unable to summon to give evidence on their suspected misdeeds. As MPs were sharply reminded when they tried to unpick the Iraq war shambles, ministers, civil servants and special advisers who constitute the government can\u2019t be forced to tell all. A select committee wishing to do that would have to get agreement via a vote of the full House, which (of course) usually has a government majority, so no worries, Tony, Gordon, Dave. But we live in interesting times where loyalties are fluid and majorities fragile. It would certainly make a more interesting and important test case than even King Phil. Long live backbench power.",

      "bodyText": "Brexit pursued by a bear. Traders in the City of London are not especially renowned for their cultural appreciation but Shakespeare\u2019s most famous stage direction has been adapted to sum up the mood with just over a week to go before the referendum. There was certainly a bit of A Winter\u2019s Tale feel about the financial markets as investors pored over the latest opinion polls suggesting the leave side is on course for what, only a month ago, looked like an improbable victory. Money is being moved into safe havens, with the interest rates on German 10-year bonds turning negative for the first time. This shows the extent of the nervousness, because it means investors are prepared to park their money with Angela Merkel\u2019s government for the next decade at a loss. UK bond yields also fell, which the Ukip MP, Douglas Carswell, saw as a vote of confidence. This argument does not stand up to serious scrutiny. If international investors were really upbeat about Britain, they would be buying shares in UK companies and the pound would be going up on the foreign exchanges. Yet the FTSE 100 fell below the 6,000 level for the first time since February and sterling was down against the dollar, the euro and the yen. Unsurprisingly, shares on European bourses were also down, with Frankfurt and Paris nursing similar losses to those seen in the City. There is a concern that the turbulence that some predict would follow Brexit will have a negative impact on German and French companies that export to the UK. The jittery state of the markets is helpful to the remain campaign, since it helps reinforce its core message of the economic risks associated with a vote to leave. David Cameron will probably not be unhappy that the pound is taking a thumping and that shares are struggling. As things stand, some ugly trading sessions between now and 23 June could be the prime minister\u2019s last hope of plucking victory from the jaws of defeat.",

If international investors were really upbeat about Britain, they would be buying shares in UK companies and the pound would be going up on the foreign exchanges.

      "bodyText": "Go-Ahead shares fell 15% after the rail and bus operator said its contract to run the GTR train service, which includes Thameslink, would be less profitable than expected. In a trading update brought forward from next week, Go-Ahead said the cost of extra investment in GTR would halve profit margins for the contract\u2019s duration to 2021 to 1.5% from a forecast of 3%. Go-Ahead shares fell to \u00a320.70 as investors reacted to the news on Britain\u2019s biggest rail franchise, won by Go-Ahead and its French partner, state-owned Keolis, two years ago. The GTR network takes in the Thameslink commuter service from Brighton through London, the Great Northern service from London to Kings Lynn and Southern, which includes the Gatwick Express. Go-Ahead and Keolis started operating the service in September 2014 and agreed to be paid a flat fee by the government of about \u00a38.9bn. Govia, Go-Ahead\u2019s joint venture with Keolis, took on the risk of extra costs after pledging to install new rolling stock and run more trains to win the franchise. The UK company said hiring and training hundreds of train drivers, buying new trains and installing free Wi-Fi at GTR would cost more than expected. It also highlighted fraught industrial relations at GTR where conductors and drivers are in dispute over the introduction of driver-operated trains. David Brown, Go-Ahead\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cGTR continues to work closely with industry partners and to invest in additional resources to deliver the best possible service to its customers in a very challenging operational and industrial relations environment. \u201cAs previously reported, the additional resources being invested in GTR to support service delivery are depressing margins on that contract in the current year and will also impact on next year\u2019s margins.\u201d Brown said margins would improve as the contract wears on but Go-Ahead no longer expects to make up profit shortfalls. He said overall the company would have strong profit growth in the financial year to 2 July, in line with market expectations. The London Midland and Southeastern rail franchises, also operated by Go-Ahead are trading well, Brown said. Brown said in February Go-Ahead\u2019s service had to improve after it reported a 17% rise in first-half profit as a survey showed Thameslink and Southeastern had the worst customer satisfaction results among rail users.",

    "webTitle": "Sir Philip Green's grilling by MPs: the 11 key questions", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Sir Philip Green is scheduled to appear before MPs on Wednesday for one of the most eagerly anticipated parliamentary hearings since they were first televised in 2002. The billionaire is under mounting pressure to explain his role in the demise of BHS, with MPs from all the major parties calling for Green to be stripped of his knighthood. The boss of Arcadia \u2013 which also controls fashion chains including Topshop, Dorothy Perkins, Evans and Miss Selfridge \u2013 has threatened to pull out of the hearing unless Frank Field, the Labour MP, resigns as chairman. Green has claimed that Field is biased and attempting to destroy his reputation. Field has insisted, however, that he is going nowhere. If Green does appear, these are the questions the MPs on the work and pensions committee and business, innovation and skills committee should ask: Why did you sell BHS to Dominic Chappell? The obvious question for Green and one that is at the heart of the BHS scandal, which has put 11,000 jobs at risk and left the department store chain with a \u00a3571m pension deficit. Dominic Chappell\u2019s consortium Retail Acquisitions bought BHS for \u00a31 from Arcadia in March 2015. The deal was done despite Chappell being declared bankrupt three times and having no experience in the retail industry. Michael Hitchcock, the former finance consultant of BHS, told MPs last week that Chappell was a \u201cpremier league liar\u201d. Why did Green trust this man to run BHS? Chappell himself has claimed that Green \u201cgenuinely thought\u201d Retail Acquisitions would fail to turn around BHS. Why were you in such a hurry to sell BHS? Chappell told MPs last week that Arcadia had decided it would not put any more money into BHS. As a result, Green either needed to sell the company or put it into liquidation before a \u00a350m quarterly rent bill due in March 2015. Is that correct? What profit did you and your wife make from BHS? The Guardian has calculated that Green and other investors took out more than \u00a3580m from BHS in dividends, rental payments, and interest on loans. The tycoon controlled the business between 2000 and 2015, with his wife, Tina, being the ultimate owner. MPs have accused Green of being an \u201cunscrupulous chancer\u201d and overseeing \u201cwealth extraction rather than wealth creation\u201d. In response, Green has claimed that BHS racked up years of losses that hurt Arcadia, and that his company wrote off more than \u00a3200m of loans that it had pumped into the struggling department store chain. However, BHS had been starved of investment, according to evidence from Chappell and senior management at BHS. Is Green prepared to admit that he took money out of BHS and could have done more to modernise it? What will you do to help the BHS pension scheme? MPs are likely to spend a significant amount of time in the hearing on Wednesday questioning Green on the negotiations that took place between himself, the BHS pension trustees and the Pensions Regulator about restructuring the BHS pension scheme. Why, for example, did Green say he was only prepared to put \u00a310m a year into the scheme despite it being deep in deficit? Also, why did Arcadia \u201cpause\u201d a plan to restructure the BHS pension scheme in 2014? However, what really matters is what Green does next. The BHS pension scheme is heading for the Pension Protection Fund, where workers will suffer a 10% cut to their benefits. The Pensions Regulator is exploring whether Green should be forced to contribute to the BHS pension scheme. Sources close to the situation claim Green might propose his own plan that involves creating a separate pension scheme, backed by his own money, which could mean BHS workers avoiding a cut to their benefits. How much did you know about Chappell\u2019s deal with the Dellal family? Ace, a property company owned by the Dellal family, provided \u00a335m to Chappell so he could demonstrate his financial credibility to Arcadia. However, evidence from the Dellals and Chappell shows this \u00a335m was then meant to be spent on buying Marylebone House, BHS\u2019s headquarters, which was owned by Green. This looks like it could be a roundabout way of Green effectively financing Retail Acquisitions\u2019 takeover of BHS. Also, why, after Green pulled out of the Marylebone House deal, did he pay Retail Acquisitions \u00a310m in compensation, which is what Chappell has claimed? Why did you sell Marylebone House to Arcadia when there were external buyers? Wilton Equity, the offshore vehicle that owned Marylebone House, was bought by Arcadia for \u00a353m. Wilton Equity was controlled by Lady Green, meaning the deal netted her a \u00a353m windfall and was similar to a dividend payment from Arcadia. Although the property was not owned by BHS, could Green not have used its value to help the retailer? Did you use \u00a335m of debt to unduly influence BHS in the past year? Arcadia is owed \u00a335m by BHS and is one of the company\u2019s main creditors. Green says he left this debt in place when selling BHS in order to offer security to the pension scheme. The tycoon is now under pressure to waive Arcadia\u2019s claim to that \u00a335m, and that is another question for MPs. However, Chappell\u2019s claims that he spoke to Green \u201cevery other day or every third day\u201d after buying BHS mean MPs must get to the bottom of how much influence the tycoon was still wielding over the retailer even after he sold it. Did you break a promise to arrange credit insurance for BHS? Credit insurance is vital for a retailer. It means a supplier is insured when they sell products to a retailer in case they do not get paid. Retailers without credit insurance have to pay funds upfront to suppliers, which is a heavy burden. Chappell claims that Green promised to ensure that BHS had the major credit insurers. However, it lost credit insurance, which put major pressure on the company\u2019s balance sheet. Did you block a BHS rescue deal with Sports Direct? Chappell claims Green went \u201cinsane\u201d when he found out BHS was in talks with Mike Ashley\u2019s Sports Direct about buying the company. Green allegedly blocked the deal and called in Arcadia\u2019s \u00a335m of debt, pushing BHS into administration. How much did you or your companies pay to Retail Acquisitions or Dominic Chappell? Chappell has promised to provide deals of transactions involving himself, BHS and Retail Acquisitions, so Green should reveal the deals between himself, Arcadia, and Chappell. Chappell claimed that he received \u00a310m from Arcadia and the Greens as compensation for the collapse of the Marylebone House deal, including a \u00a33.5m loan from Lady Green. However, Lady Green has already written to MPs to say in \u201cunequivocal terms\u201d that she and her husband have never had personal business dealings with Chappell or Retail Acquisitions. Do you think your conduct has been befitting of a knight? Morals and ethics are at the core of the BHS scandal. Green and Chappell had a responsibility to the 11,000 workers at BHS but let them down. MPs should just get to the point and ask Green whether he believes his stewardship of BHS was appropriate for a man who has been knighted for services to the retail industry.",

Dominic Chappell\u2019s consortium Retail Acquisitions bought BHS for \u00a31 from Arcadia in March 2015. The deal was done despite Chappell being declared bankrupt three times and having no experience in the retail industry. Michael Hitchcock, the former finance consultant of BHS, told MPs last week that Chappell was a \u201cpremier league liar\u201d. Why did Green trust this man to run BHS? Chappell himself has claimed that Green \u201cgenuinely thought\u201d Retail Acquisitions would fail to turn around BHS.</p> <p><strong>Why were you in such a hurry to sell <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/bhs\">BHS</a>?</strong></p> <p>Chappell told MPs last week that Arcadia had decided it would not put any more money into BHS. As a result, Green either needed to sell the company or put it into liquidation before a \u00a350m quarterly rent bill due in March 2015. Is that correct?</p> <p><strong>What profit did you and your wife make from BHS?</strong></p> <p>The Guardian has calculated that Green and other investors<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/25/bhs-philip-green-family-millions-administration-arcadia\"> took out more than \u00a3580m from BHS in dividends, rental payments, and interest on loans. </a>The tycoon controlled the business between 2000 and 2015, with his wife, Tina, being the ultimate owner. MPs have accused Green of being an \u201c<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/06/mps-accuse-sir-philip-green-of-being-an-unscrupulous-chancer\">unscrupulous chancer\u201d and overseeing \u201cwealth extraction rather than wealth creation\u201d.</a> In response, Green has claimed that BHS racked up years of losses that hurt Arcadia, and that his company wrote off more than \u00a3200m of loans that it had pumped into the struggling department store chain. However, BHS had been starved of investment, according to evidence from Chappell and senior management at BHS. Is Green prepared to admit that he took money out of BHS and could have done more to modernise it?</p> <p><strong>What will you do to help the BHS pension scheme?</strong></p> <p>MPs are likely to spend a significant amount of time in the hearing on Wednesday questioning Green on the negotiations that took place between himself, the BHS pension trustees and the Pensions Regulator about restructuring the BHS pension scheme. Why, for example, did Green say he was <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/25/philip-green-10m-a-year-in-bhs-pensions-scheme-mps-dominic-chappell\">only prepared to put \u00a310m a year into the scheme despite it being deep in deficit?</a> Also, why did Arcadia <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/09/pensions-regulator-says-it-learned-about-bhs-sale-in-the-papers\">\u201cpause\u201d a plan to restructure the BHS pension scheme in 2014? </a>However, what really matters is what Green does next. The BHS pension scheme is heading for the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/25/pension-protection-fund-bhs-retirement-ppf\">Pension Protection Fund</a>, where workers will suffer a 10% cut to their benefits. The Pensions Regulator is exploring whether Green should be forced to contribute to the BHS pension scheme. </p> <p>Sources close to the situation claim Green might propose his own plan that involves creating a separate pension scheme, backed by his own money, which could mean BHS workers avoiding a cut to their benefits.</p> <p><strong>How much did you know about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/01/property-investors-guy-alexander-dellal-face-mps-over-bhs-takeover\">Chappell\u2019s deal with the Dellal family</a>?</strong></p> <p>Ace, a property company owned by the Dellal family, provided \u00a335m to Chappell so he could demonstrate his financial credibility to Arcadia. However, evidence from the Dellals and Chappell shows this \u00a335m was then meant to be spent on buying Marylebone House, BHS\u2019s headquarters, which was owned by Green. This looks like it could be a roundabout way of Green effectively financing Retail Acquisitions\u2019 takeover of BHS. Also, why, after Green pulled out of the Marylebone House deal, did he pay Retail Acquisitions \u00a310m in compensation, which is what Chappell has claimed?</p> <p><strong>Why did you sell Marylebone House to Arcadia when there were external buyers?</strong></p> <p>Wilton Equity, the offshore vehicle that owned Marylebone House, was bought by Arcadia for \u00a353m. <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/09/lady-green-53m-windfall-bhs-hq-arcadia-philip-green\">Wilton Equity was controlled by Lady Green, meaning the deal netted her a \u00a353m windfall</a> and was similar to a dividend payment from Arcadia. Although the property was not owned by BHS, could Green not have used its value to help the retailer?</p> <p><strong>Did you use \u00a335m of debt to unduly influence BHS in the past year?<br tabindex=\"-1\"></strong></p> <p>Arcadia is owed \u00a335m by BHS and is one of the company\u2019s main creditors. Green says he left this debt in place when selling BHS in order to offer security to the pension scheme. The tycoon is now under pressure to waive Arcadia\u2019s claim to that \u00a335m, and that is another question for MPs. However, Chappell\u2019s claims that he spoke to Green \u201cevery other day or every third day\u201d after buying BHS mean MPs must get to the bottom of how much influence the tycoon was still wielding over the retailer even after he sold it.</p> <p><strong>Did you break a promise to arrange <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/31/bhs-ex-owner-blames-philip-green-for-retail-firms-collapse\">credit insurance for BHS</a>?</strong></p> <p>Credit insurance is vital for a retailer. It means a supplier is insured when they sell products to a retailer in case they do not get paid. Retailers without credit insurance have to pay funds upfront to suppliers, which is a heavy burden. Chappell claims that Green promised to ensure that BHS had the major credit insurers. However, it lost credit insurance, which put major pressure on the company\u2019s balance sheet.</p> <p><strong>Did you block a BHS rescue deal with Sports Direct?</strong></p> <p>Chappell claims Green went \u201cinsane\u201d when he found out <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/24/bhs-on-the-brink-of-collapse-unless-60m-pounds-funding-found\">BHS was in talks with Mike Ashley\u2019s Sports Direct</a> about buying the company. Green allegedly blocked the deal and called in Arcadia\u2019s \u00a335m of debt, pushing BHS into administration.</p> <p><strong>How much did you or your companies pay to Retail Acquisitions or Dominic Chappell?</strong></p> <p>Chappell has promised to provide deals of transactions involving himself, BHS and Retail Acquisitions, so Green should reveal the deals between himself, Arcadia, and Chappell. Chappell claimed that he received \u00a310m from Arcadia and the Greens as compensation for the collapse of the Marylebone House deal, including a \u00a33.5m loan from Lady Green. However, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/10/bhs-collapse-pressure-grows-on-sir-philip-green-to-plug-pension-deficit\">Lady Green has already written to MPs</a> to say in \u201cunequivocal terms\u201d that she and her husband have never had personal business dealings with Chappell or Retail Acquisitions.</p> <p><strong>Do you think your conduct has been befitting of a knight?<br></strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/05/the-observer-view-on-the-closure-of-bhs\">Morals and ethics are at the core of the BHS scandal. </a>Green and Chappell had a responsibility to the 11,000 workers at BHS but let them down. MPs should just get to the point and ask Green whether he believes his stewardship of BHS was appropriate for a man who has been knighted for services to the retail industry.</p>",
