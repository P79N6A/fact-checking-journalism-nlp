      "bodyText": "Warren Marvelley was in a hopeful mood on Saturday. He and his wife, Jane, have set their hearts on buying a new VW Golf and believe the time is ripe to buy one. The decision may seem odd, given the turmoil that now surrounds Volkswagen. Last week its share price plummeted after senior executives admitted that Volkswagen had disguised illegal levels of emissions produced by some diesel-engined cars. Nevertheless, the Marvelleys, from Rochdale, Greater Manchester, were buoyant during their visit to the Lookers showroom in Blackburn. \u201cI\u2019ve read all about the scandal, but it really doesn\u2019t bother me that much,\u201d said 51-year-old Warren. \u201cYes, a few of their people have cooked the figures, but I don\u2019t think we\u2019re talking drastic amounts, so I won\u2019t be holding it against them.\u201d In fact, the Marvelleys believe the scandal may play into their hands: they will be looking for a suitable discount on their car. \u201cVW have said they want to be transparent and do the right thing, and I\u2019m pretty confident they will,\u201d said Warren. \u201cThey\u2019re a good company, so I think they\u2019ll feel obliged to compensate people.\u201d The Marvelleys were not the only people moving in on Volkswagen, however. Across the globe there were signs that the trickle of action taken against the corporation was turning into a torrent. As Berthold Huber \u2013 acting head of VW\u2019s supervisory board \u2013 put it, the company is now facing a \u201cmoral and policy disaster\u201d. Switzerland gave one example by halting sales of VW diesel cars. The ban involves any vehicles in the Euro 5 category, about 180,000 cars This contains the majority of the cars VW has admitted have been fitted with defeat devices, which were installed to disguise illegal emission levels. Other countries \u2013 including Germany, the US and the UK \u2013 have launched investigations into diesel emissions since the scandal emerged and could also ban VW cars from their roads. The VW group has admitted that 11 million vehicles worldwide, including five million Volkswagen brand cars, were fitted with defeat devices. It has now set aside \u20ac6.5bn (\u00a34.8bn) to pay for the costs of the crisis. However, it also faces the prospect of fines of up to $18bn from US regulators and could find itself at the receiving end of one of the biggest legal claims in history from customers and shareholders around the world. On Friday, a week after the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) first made allegations against VW, the company blamed the emissions scandal on a \u201csmall group\u201d of people and suspended a number of staff. VW made the comments at a press conference to unveil Matthias M\u00fcller as its new chief executive, replacing Martin Winterkorn, who resigned on Wednesday in response to the scandal. The carmaker has also called an extraordinary shareholder meeting on 9 November. The German government has said that 2.8 million of the 11 million cars installed with the defeat device were sold in Germany and commercial vehicles were also involved. Documents have also emerged showing that EU offices knew two years ago that devices could skew emissions tests. The EPA also warned that it would step up emissions testing of all carmakers and that VW faces \u201cmassive fines\u201d. Not surprisingly, the story has dominated the German press. \u201cPlease clean up, Herr M\u00fcller!\u201d said the centre-left daily S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung, which warned that the new Volkswagen boss faces a \u201cHerculean task\u201d to revamp the company in the next few months. \u201cThe goal is to open up the empire which has been run for years as a centralised, insular kingdom.\u201d Der Spiegel took a broader view of the scandal, warning that the billion-dollar class action lawsuits Volkswagen faces in the US could be a serious threat to the whole company. It quoted one lawyer as saying that VW could have to sell off brands to pay its fines, just as BP had to sell some operations after the Gulf of Mexico disaster. The conservative daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung said German transport minister Alexander Dobrindt is under mounting pressure. \u201cThe fact that scores of VW executives and other unnamed staff are losing their jobs suggests that the practice of cheating and concealment is far more widespread than thought,\u201d it pointed out. \u2022 This article was amended on 27 September 2015 to remove inaccuracies introduced during the editing process.",

      "bodyText": "From a distance, it might be a temple to the German car industry. On the edge of the small town of Wolfsburg two skyscrapers of cars tower over the land. Each glass-and-steel cylinder is almost 50 metres high and packed with 400 new Volkswagens: trim little Golfs, sleek Passat sedans and boxy people carriers. From the top there\u2019s a view of the vast, red-brick, 1930s-era Volkswagen factory, which turns out 2,300 cars a day. Another direction offers a glimpse of Porsche Street, Wolfsburg\u2019s main thoroughfare, named in honour of the German car dynasty that created the VW Beetle and the eponymous sports car company. In the far distance are the autobahns where motorists are rarely troubled by speed limits. Cars are parked in the VW towers for one or two days as they await collection. Each car is rolled out of the factory on an underground track, then propelled upwards into the tower. A car can move from factory floor to tower top in less than two minutes without a human hand touching the steering wheel. Hundreds of cars glide up and down every day, their movements controlled by computer. In 15 years of operation, VW says it has not seen so much as a single smashed wing mirror. This flawless precision technology is precisely what VW is renowned for. Now its technical mastery has tipped the German carmaker into the biggest crisis of its post-second world war history. VW admitted last week that software that allowed cheating on emissions tests had been installed in 11 million cars. The defeat devices are likely to have caused almost one million tonnes of extra air pollution a year and may have triggered years of costly litigation. VW has set aside \u20ac6.5bn (\u00a34.7bn) , but the scandal is likely to cost far more. US regulators, including the Environmental Protection Agency, could levy a fine of up to $18bn. At the last count, 10 countries had launched some form of investigation, while class action lawsuits are raining down. The scandal has dominated newspaper front pages around the world for a week. The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, has demanded answers and set up a federal inquiry. The state of Lower Saxony, which owns a 20% stake in VW, has launched its own investigation amid fears that the fallout could damage the German car industry, which employs 800,000 directly with millions more jobs linked to it. One Socialist party politician, Martin Burkert, warned that the entire Made in Germany brand would be damaged, while the newspaper Die Welt speculated that VW\u2019s survival was at risk. Carsten Brzeski, chief economist at the Dutch banking group ING, went a step further: \u201cIf Volkswagen\u2019s sales were to plunge in North America in the coming months,\u201d he warned, \u201cthis would not only have an impact on the company, but on the German economy as a whole. All of a sudden, Volkswagen has become a bigger downside risk for the German economy than the Greek debt crisis.\u201d The scandal has hit a raw nerve, because VW is more than just another car company. Employing more than 592,000 people around the world, it earned a record \u20ac14.8bn in profit in 2014 and earlier this year overtook its rival Toyota to become the world\u2019s largest carmaker. But the company is more than an economic powerhouse. In a YouGov poll last month, two-thirds of Germans named Volkswagen as the country\u2019s number one national symbol, putting it before Merkel, the national football team, Goethe and currywurst. It would be a bit like the UK deciding that John Lewis was the essence of the nation, rating it more highly than Shakespeare, Churchill or chicken tikka masala. Prof Bernhard Rieger, the author of a history of the VW Beetle, says the fact that VW is seen as a symbol of German identity explains why there is \u201ca certain amount of hysteria\u201d around the scandal. In his book The People\u2019s Car, he traces how VW became the emblem of the post-second world war economic miracle: the Wirtschaftswunder. \u201cThe Federal Republic [of West Germany] for obvious reasons shied away from national symbols,\u201d he told the Observer. \u201cOne of the very few things that emerged as a unifying symbol, along with the football team and the deutsche mark, was Volkswagen. VW retains its salience in modern Germany; otherwise you wouldn\u2019t get this brouhaha.\u201d The story goes back to Wolfsburg. Although the first VW prototype was built in the Nazi era on the orders of Adolf Hitler, who wanted \u201ca people\u2019s car\u201d, mass production began in December 1945, as Germany emerged from the ruin of war. By then, Volkswagen was controlled by the British military government, which handed vehicle manufacturing back to Germany because no British manufacturer wanted to take on the plant. The VW car was \u201cquite unattractive to the average buyer\u201d, a leading British motor industry executive decided. He could not have been more wrong. Within a generation the Beetle was the world\u2019s bestselling car: in 1972 it overtook the Model T Ford as the world\u2019s most manufactured vehicle. Although production was stopped in Germany a few years after this milestone, VW\u2019s expansion continued despite the economic turmoil of the 1970s and early 1980s. In the 80s, 90s and early 2000s, the German company swept up Seat of Spain, the Czech brand Skoda, Britain\u2019s Bentley limousines and a majority share in Sweden\u2019s Scania buses and trucks. The swagger of this era is reflected in the theme park that Volkswagen built next to its headquarters. Completed in 2000, Autostadt is Disneyland for car fans. Spread over 28 acres of clinically landscaped parkland is a vintage-car museum, driving track, restaurants, a five-star hotel and the VW car towers. The park draws more than two million visitors a year, mostly from Germany, and is a testament to the country\u2019s enduring love of the car. In the entrance atrium a giant steel globe is suspended from the ceiling, with only one place marked \u2013 Wolfsburg. But now Wolfsburg is worried. For decades VW cash has kept this small, unassuming town afloat: funding everything from the yellow and red flowers planted on Porsche Street to a modern art gallery and the 37,000-capacity football stadium. (To add insult to injury, Wolfsburg FC were thrashed 5-1 by rivals Bayern Munich on the day VW admitted the rogue software was installed far more widely than previously thought.) \u201cEveryone is frightened, at Volkswagen and in the town itself, and nobody knows where this will lead,\u201d says Kevin Nobs, co-editor of the Wolfsburger Allgemeine. \u201cThe whole city is absolutely dependent on VW, whether we work there or not. My father works at VW, most of my friends work there. Everyone has a connection to VW and their suppliers.\u201d It is worse, he says, than in the 1990s when a sales slowdown resulted in job losses. At that time, trade union leaders agreed to go down to a four-day week to save jobs, but nobody knows whether this would be an option if jobs are cut this time around. \u201cNow we don\u2019t have any options. The worker in the street doesn\u2019t know what will happen.\u201d The ripples will be felt across the prosperous central German region. As several German politicians said last week, when Volkswagen sneezes, Lower Saxony catches cold. \u201cIt is a disaster,\u201d says Matthias Groote, an SPD member of the European parliament for Lower Saxony, who says he is most worried about VW\u2019s workforce and dependent suppliers. \u201c[VW] has to take moral responsibility. The new managerial team has to work really hard to regain trust.\u201d But he does not agree with speculation that VW\u2019s survival is at stake. Groote points out that other car companies have not been felled by scandals, citing General Motors, where faulty ignition switches have been linked to the deaths of at least 124 people. \u201c[GM] also has to work hard to regain its reputation and to win back trust.\u201d But in VW\u2019s heartland the story is only just beginning. \u201cThere will be lots of consequences, but the consequences will mostly be for Wolfsburg itself,\u201d Kevin Nobs of the Wolfsburger Allgemeine says. \u201cThe town lives from taxes from Volkswagen and these taxes will be reduced by a great amount for years to come.\u201d The story of the \u2018people\u2019s car\u2019 1938 Adolf Hitler inspects the \u2018people\u2019s car\u2019. After the war British carmakers turned down the chance to run the VW plant, with one executive saying the Beetle was \u2018quite unattractive to the average buyer\u2019. 1970s Hollywood comes calling as Disney makes a star out of a VW called Herbie, seen above in Herbie Goes to Monte Carlo. In 1972 the Beetle overtook the Model T Ford as the world\u2019s most manufactured vehicle. 1975 The Golf sets new standards for the family hatchback, with the GTI version, above, establishing a reputation for performance that helped to turbocharge the VW name. 1978 An advert for the Bus. By now, VW camper vans had become the go-to vehicle for a family holiday or a hippy escape. Vintage vans are still in use today, lovingly restored and with a high price to boot. 1987 Volkswagen goes stylish with its ads as the marque moves upmarket with a classic campaign, right. Far right, US hip-hop band the Beastie Boys turn the VW badge into a fashion statement. 2015 Volkswagen chief executive Martin Winterkorn resigns following the emissions-rigging scandal that has dented the company\u2019s reputation for technological excellence.",

Within a generation the Beetle was the world\u2019s bestselling car: in 1972 it overtook the Model T Ford as the world\u2019s most manufactured vehicle. Although production was stopped in Germany a few years after this milestone, VW\u2019s expansion continued despite the economic turmoil of the 1970s and early 1980s. In the 80s, 90s and early 2000s, the German company swept up Seat of Spain, the Czech brand Skoda, Britain\u2019s Bentley limousines and a majority share in Sweden\u2019s Scania buses and trucks.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"534763120b343535b74b563a7828eb7df9e17907\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/9/25/1443206340147/672f1a91-1d4b-4a46-a36b-30e807b06e0c-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"A scene from the 1977 Disney film Herbie Goes to Monte Carlo.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A scene from the 1977 Disney film Herbie Goes to Monte Carlo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Disney/Sportsphoto Ltd</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The swagger of this era is reflected in the theme park that Volkswagen built next to its headquarters. Completed in 2000, Autostadt is Disneyland for car fans. Spread over 28 acres of clinically landscaped parkland is a vintage-car museum, driving track, restaurants, a five-star hotel and the VW car towers. The park draws more than two million visitors a year, mostly from Germany, and is a testament to the country\u2019s enduring love of the car. In the entrance atrium a giant steel globe is suspended from the ceiling, with only one place marked \u2013 Wolfsburg.</p> <p>But now Wolfsburg is worried. For decades VW cash has kept this small, unassuming town afloat: funding everything from the yellow and red flowers planted on Porsche Street to a modern art gallery and the 37,000-capacity football stadium. (To add insult to injury, Wolfsburg FC were thrashed 5-1 by rivals Bayern Munich on the day VW admitted the rogue software was installed far more widely than previously thought.)</p> <p>\u201cEveryone is frightened, at Volkswagen and in the town itself, and nobody knows where this will lead,\u201d says Kevin Nobs, co-editor of the <em>Wolfsburger Allgemeine</em>. \u201cThe whole city is absolutely dependent on VW, whether we work there or not. My father works at VW, most of my friends work there. Everyone has a connection to VW and their suppliers.\u201d It is worse, he says, than in the 1990s when a sales slowdown resulted in job losses. At that time, trade union leaders agreed to go down to a four-day week to save jobs, but nobody knows whether this would be an option if jobs are cut this time around. \u201cNow we don\u2019t have any options. The worker in the street doesn\u2019t know what will happen.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/sep/25/vw-emissions-scandal-seven-days\">Volkswagen scandal \u2013 seven days that rocked the German carmaker</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The ripples will be felt across the prosperous central German region. As several German politicians said last week, when Volkswagen sneezes, Lower Saxony catches cold. \u201cIt is a disaster,\u201d says Matthias Groote, an SPD member of the European parliament for Lower Saxony, who says he is most worried about VW\u2019s workforce and dependent suppliers. \u201c[VW] has to take moral responsibility. The new managerial team has to work really hard to regain trust.\u201d</p> <p>But he does not agree with speculation that VW\u2019s survival is at stake. Groote points out that other car companies have not been felled by scandals, citing General Motors, where faulty ignition switches have been linked to the deaths of at least 124 people. \u201c[GM] also has to work hard to regain its reputation and to win back trust.\u201d</p> <p>But in VW\u2019s heartland the story is only just beginning. \u201cThere will be lots of consequences, but the consequences will mostly be for Wolfsburg itself,\u201d Kevin Nobs of the <em>Wolfsburger Allgemeine </em>says. \u201cThe town lives from taxes from Volkswagen and these taxes will be reduced by a great amount for years to come.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>The story of the \u2018people\u2019s car\u2019</strong></h2> <p><strong>1938</strong> Adolf Hitler inspects the \u2018people\u2019s car\u2019.

      "bodyText": "Lord Browne is no stranger to crises, both professional and personal. His reign as chief executive of oil giant BP was marred by the Texas City refinery explosion in 2005, in which 15 people died. And his BP career ended prematurely two years later after he lied to a court about the manner in which he had met his boyfriend. Nevertheless, Lord Browne, 67, is recognised as a wise veteran of the business world. His comeback was helped by a stint as a senior government adviser on business until last year. He has written a book, The Glass Closet, about being homosexual in the workplace. He has even re-entered the oil business, becoming executive chairman of Russian oligarch Mikhail Fridman\u2019s LetterOne group, with $10bn of Russian cash. And now he has written another book, Connect, which looks at how companies can cope with crisis by engaging more closely with society. So it was fitting that Browne found himself publicising this tome in the week that scandal engulfed German carmaker Volkswagen. Browne\u2019s thesis is that a company will recover faster from a PR disaster if it has already built up a reservoir of trust with society and consumers. He reckons that a company\u2019s relationship with society accounts for around 30% of its market value. Moving quickly and openly to make amends is also key. \u201cVW could have a faster recovery than somebody else,\u201d he says, in an answer that mixes the personal with the corporate. \u201cIf you trust someone you are more likely to forgive them when they do something wrong. The same applies to companies. VW\u2019s reputation for affordable quality will stand it in good stead, so will the speed with which it has apologised and promised to put things right.\u201d Others may differ, arguing that VW\u2019s deliberate deceit will more than wipe out the trust it has built. But there is little doubt that some firms start in a stronger position than others. Browne knows what it is like to have a crisis on one\u2019s watch: he was in charge at BP in 2005 when the Texas City refinery explosion killed 15 and injured more than 170. It was the biggest black mark against Browne\u2019s 12-year reign at BP. Five years later, three years after he\u2019d left BP, Browne found himself uncannily close to the scene of the group\u2019s most costly disaster: the Deepwater Horizon explosion in April 2010. As the scale of the catastrophe became clear \u2013 11 workers killed and the biggest oil spill in US history \u2013 Browne happened to be in Texas. \u201cI was in Fort Worth to see Before Night Falls, an opera about Aids and destitution,\u201d the businessman says. \u201cBut I was also watching in real time the oil pouring out into the Gulf of Mexico. I knew everybody that was on the television screen speaking about it. It was a real workout for me, though nothing like what it must have been for those involved or those who died. I kept thinking, how big is this going to be, what is going on? BP was scrambling a lot.\u201d Tony Hayward, the then BP chief executive, was struggling. He eventually lost any hope of keeping his job by saying he \u201cwanted his life back\u201d and was photographed on a sailing trip. He was forced to quit shortly afterwards. \u201cHe had a tough time,\u201d says Browne. \u201cCommunications were not his greatest strength. He\u2019s a very fine geologist but one thing led to another. With all these big crises, you have to overreact.\u201d That crisis cost BP more than $50bn and Browne says the damage to the firm\u2019s reputation will take time to mend. \u201cBP needs to recover step by step,\u201d he says. \u201cYou need to build a reservoir of trust so that when things go wrong, people will give you the benefit of the doubt.\u201d In his book Browne highlights how well US pharmaceuticals group Johnson &amp; Johnson coped in 1982 when seven people died after taking its market-leading painkiller, Tylenol. It dealt with the crisis swiftly, taking all the painkillers off the shelves when it was discovered that some had been tampered with. But, just as important, says Browne, the company had built up a reservoir of trust. \u201cPeople tend to treat companies as they do other human beings,\u201d writes Browne. \u201cIf we trust someone and believe them to be of good character, we are likely to forgive them when they make a mistake.\u201d The likes of Cadbury, Hershey and Johnson &amp; Johnson all score highly in Browne\u2019s opinion. He says these companies know who they are, what they are for and engage with society. And this is a job, he reckons, for management, rather than specialist corporate social responsibility (CSR) units \u2013 which he would like to see axed. \u201cSir Howard Davies [chair of the UK Airports Commission] describes CSR as something the board might look at on a Friday afternoon, and I worry that it\u2019s not at the heart of a business. Remember Enron was a big CSR winner,\u201d Browne says, referring to the giant energy trading group that collapsed after widespread fraud was uncovered. \u201cIt\u2019s important that business engages with society about the climate, pollution and education. These things are very important. Lesbian and gay rights, human rights, ethnic rights \u2013 these should all be done within the business. We should try to distribute CSR back into the business. I am not designing a recipe but I want people to think.\u201d Browne accepts that business has an uneasy relationship with society and worries that we are in \u201cdangerous territory when the majority of people don\u2019t like business\u201d. The anti-business climate is fed by social media, he adds. \u201cWhatever business has done is known in a microsecond and the debate is much more vivid \u2026 as time goes by business is liked less and kicked more.\u201d Which is all the more reason for management to engage, he says. \u201cThere will always be things that will go wrong, but by engaging with people you will go a very long way.\u201d And what about BP? Does he think his former group has recovered fully from Deepwater? \u201cI think it\u2019s too early to tell. It\u2019s taken a very long time to sort out the legal side, and the group hasn\u2019t yet been able to do what other companies might have been able to do.\u201d As if the pain of BP is still very close to his heart, he adds: \u201cLet\u2019s get through this first.\u201d Browne speaks proudly of enrolling Senator George Mitchell, who was instrumental in the Northern Island peace process, to independently assess a gas project for BP in Papua, Indonesia, in 2002: \u201cPeople trusted him and his commission more than any businessperson.\u201d But all this talk of trust and engagement is not just about improving the image of business. He reckons it is also the main route to bigger profits: \u201cEvery day there\u2019s a potential crisis. The more you engage with society, the more you have a reservoir of goodwill that will limit the risks \u2013 and the more you make money.\u201d Connect, written with Robin Nuttall and Tommy Stadlen (WH Allen, \u00a320) is out now.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "John German has barely had time to catch his breath all week between appearances on TV news channel and radio phone-in shows. He\u2019s an unlikely media star, not a pop singer or reality TV contestant, but a grey-haired automotive engineer thrust into the global spotlight after he and his colleagues were credited with helping uncover one of the biggest ever corporate scandals. \u201cWe really didn\u2019t expect to find anything,\u201d German said of his research that found Volkswagen had installed sophisticated software designed to cheat strict emission tests across the world. His simple test \u2013 checking the car\u2019s emissions on real roads rather than in lab test conditions \u2013 led to the resignation of VW\u2019s chief executive after the German company was forced to admit it installed \u201cdefeat devices\u201d in 11m cars. The scandal has wiped more than \u20ac24bn ($26.8bn) off VW\u2019s market value. Many questions remain but one thing is clear to German: \u201cIt was not an accident,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of work has gone into this.\u201d When German finally found a moment of peace this week he called his wife in Ann Arbor, Michigan. \u201cShe said: \u2018You know you\u2019ve made it now, you can retire and be very happy\u2019,\u201d German told the Guardian as he prepared to board a plane back to Michigan after a week in the spotlight in Washington DC. \u201cNo, no, no, I can\u2019t afford to yet,\u201d German told his disappointed wife. He may have helped uncover one of the world\u2019s biggest corporate scandals, but German earns a modest salary as US co-lead of the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT) a small nonprofit organisation dedicated to helping to reduce vehicle emissions and has an annual budget of just $12m. \u201cIt has been totally overwhelming,\u201d German said of the global interest in his research this week. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing nothing else [but responding to the media and politicians] for 12 hours a day since Friday,\u201d when US regulators announced their findings against VW based on German\u2019s research] \u201cWe\u2019re a small organisation that primarily deals with information on diesel filters, so this is unprecedented and overwhelming. \u201cAs an organisation that is trying to reduce emissions and improve efficiency it is always gratifying to see results from our work, but we never dreamed we would have this kind of impact.\u201d German explained that the idea to carry out the test, which he described as \u201cvery ordinary\u201d, came from Peter Mock, a colleague in Europe, who noticed discrepancies in the emissions of the diesel VW Passat and VW Jetta. He said they decided to carry out on-the-road tests in the US as the emissions regulations are much stricter than in the EU. They expected the cars to pass and they could use this as proof to show Europeans that it was possible to run diesels with cleaner emissions. German, who has a degree in physics from the University of Michigan and said he \u201cgot over halfway through an MBA before he came to his senses\u201d, sought out the assistance of the West Virginia University\u2019s Center for Alternative Fuels, Engines and Emissions. The WVU provided a portable emission measurement system that could be put in the car\u2019s boot (trunk) with an attached probe placed in the exhaust pipe. Then German sourced a Passat, Jetta and a BMW X5 (which also showed emissions discrepancies in Europe) and \u201chad a drive around\u201d. \u201cThe VWs were massively exceeding their official emissions readings in normal driving conditions, which was completely inexplicable and totally surprised us,\u201d German said. Thinking it must be a technical error, the tests were expanded and the cars were driven more than 1,200 miles from San Diego to Seattle \u2013 almost the entire length of the west coast of the US. The VWs nitrogen oxide emissions \u2013 which creates smog and has been linked to increased asthma attacks and other respiratory illnesses \u2013 still exceeded the US standards by up to 35 times. The BMW X5 was within the regulated range. Arvind Thiruvengadam, a research assistant professor at WVU, who conducted the tests said: \u201cWe were doubting ourselves and our procedures and making sure to double check that we were not doing anything wrong. We did so much testing we couldn\u2019t possibly doing the same mistake again and again. \u201cWe were like \u2018OK, we\u2019re going to write a lot of journal papers, and we\u2019ll be happy if three people read these journal papers,\u2019\u201d he told National Public Radio last week. \u201cThat\u2019s our happiness at that point.\u201d German published the research in May 2014 and handed it over to the Environment Protection Agency (EPA). \u201cThere was an expectation that they would find out what was causing the higher-than-expected emissions,\u201d he said. \u201cWe did send a courtesy copy to VW to say \u2018vehicles B and C are your vehicles and you might like to know\u2019, we had no response.\u201d There was no response from the EPA either, but keen-eyed German noticed an EPA press release in which VW agreed to recall almost 500,000 vehicles in December 2014 to reinstall software, which it said would solve the higher-than-expected emissions. However, a couple of months later the California Air Resources Board (Carb) carried out spot checks and discovered that the \u201cdefeat device\u201d software \u2013 used to dramatically reduces nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions only when the cars are undergoing strict emission tests \u2013 was still present. \u201cThat is actually the single most inexplicable thing about this whole business,\u201d German said. \u201cVW had a chance to fix the problem, and they continued to try and cheat and do what they had done. That\u2019s just amazing.\u201d \u201cOnly then did VW admit it had designed and installed a defeat device in these vehicles in the form of a sophisticated software algorithm that detected when a vehicle was undergoing emissions testing,\u201d the EPA said in a statement last week. German said it was unclear how the defeat device software worked, but the software could work by detecting periods when the steering column wasn\u2019t turning but the wheels were which would indicate the car was on dynamo-meters for testing, or could also test for the precise uniform temperature that the tests are carried out at. \u201cThe kind of software it takes to first detect when you\u2019re driving on the official test would be very hard to develop. And then you would need duplicate software to tell the car to have two different emission controls.\u201d He said it was impossible to know how far up the food chain at VW the fraudulent activity went, but said: \u201cIt would have had to be quite a few people involved. It certainly won\u2019t have just been one individual.\u201d German said VW could have continued in the deceit for the foreseeable future if no one had thought to test the cars emissions on real roads. He said there is no way to know if other car companies may also have been using similar methods to trick official emission tests, but welcomed UK, German and US regulators moves to retest cars emissions on real roads. German, who drives a 1997 Honda Accord station wagon that he says has pretty good emissions for a manual transmission, said he hopes his work will act as a wake-up call and scare the whole industry into making certain that their vehicles comply with all emissions regulations. \u201cCompanies should realise they might get away with stuff for a little while, but it will catch up with them.\u201d He refused to enter into discussion about what sort of action should be taken against VW, which is facing a fine of up to $16bn in the US alone and a possible criminal investigation. \u201cThat\u2019s really up to others, I\u2019m just an engineer from Michigan it\u2019s really beyond my field of reach.\u201d",

Cars consume as much as 5% more fuel per mile if the systems are running correctly, meaning that owners of vehicles fitted with defeat devices have been using less diesel but at the same time breaking legal limits on air pollution. They may also have to pay higher taxes because higher fuel consumption could alter their cars\u2019 carbon dioxide rating. On Friday, a week after the US\u2019s Environmental Protection Agency first made allegations against VW, the company blamed the emissions scandal on a \u201csmall group\u201d of people and suspended a number of staff. VW made the comments at a press conference to unveil Matthias M\u00fcller as its new chief executive, replacing Martin Winterkorn, who resigned on Wednesday in response to the scandal. The new VW boss did not reveal how many staff had been suspended or who they were, but the company said the scandal was the result of \u201cunlawful behaviour of engineers and technicians involved in engine development\u201d. Berthold Huber, the acting head of VW\u2019s supervisory board, called the crisis a \u201cmoral and policy disaster\u201d. The carmaker has called an extraordinary shareholder meeting for 9 November. \u201cThe supervisory board has, on the basis of current information, recommended suspending some employees immediately until the whole case is cleared up,\u201d Huber said. \u201cThis has in part already happened. \u201cThe test manipulations are a moral and political disaster for Volkswagen. The unlawful behaviour of engineers and technicians involved in engine development shocked Volkswagen just as much as it shocked the public. We can only apologise and ask our customers, the public, the authorities and our investors to give us a chance to make amends.\u201d The German government has said that 2.8m of the 11m cars installed with the defeat device were sold in Germany and that commercial vehicles were also involved. Documents have also emerged that showed EU offices knew two years ago that devices could skew emissions tests, and the US\u2019s Environmental Protection Agency warned that it would step up its emissions test against all carmakers and that VW faced \u201cmassive fines\u201d. In addition, Bloomberg reported that key parts of the faked emissions tests had been overseen by VW executives based in the company\u2019s headquarters in Wolfsburg.",
