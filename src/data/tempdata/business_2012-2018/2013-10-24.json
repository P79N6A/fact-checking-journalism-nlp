    "webTitle": "Bank of England to offer banks more help at lower cost, says Mark Carney", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Bank of England governor Mark Carney offered an olive branch to the City on Thursday night when he said properly managed and regulated banks would be able to secure more help at lower cost from Threadneedle Street if they got into financial trouble. Seeking to draw a line under what has often been a strained relationship, Carney said he wanted to be the friend of banks provided they were resilient and prepared to submit to tougher supervision. The governor announced new measures aimed at ensuring a bank in difficulties could secure sufficient working capital \u2013 or liquidity \u2013 to keep it going. Carney said the Bank would offer money over longer periods, accept a wider range of collateral and charge lower fees. He added: \"There has been a loss of confidence in banks and in the system. Institutions need to get their culture and core values right.\" Carney said it was striking that \"loathing\" of banks had replaced confidence in them. Threadneedle Street was strongly criticised by the City for its hardline approach to providing help in the early days of the financial crisis and Carney said his changes were the results of a review by Bill Winters carried out under his predecessor, Mervyn King. \"Five simple words describe our approach: we are open for business,\" Carney said in a speech to mark the 125th anniversary of the Financial Times. The governor added that the return of City supervision to Threadneedle Street and the international reforms put in place since the crisis meant it was possible for the Bank of England to relax exacting liquidity standards. \"The Bank of England today is the friend of resilient banks, continuous markets, and good collateral; and we are the enemy of taxpayer bailouts, fragile markets and financial instability,\" he said. \"Our facilities are not ornamental. They are there to be used by banks to access money and high quality collateral. We are offering money and collateral for longer terms. \"The range of assets we will accept in exchange will be wider, extending to raw loans and, in fact, any asset of which we are capable of assessing the risks. \"And using our facilities will be cheaper. In some cases the fees are being more than halved.\" UK banks were highly critical of the approach adopted by King in the early days of the financial crisis, when he expressed fears that providing too much help to banks in trouble would create a problem of moral hazard, encouraging the bad practices that had led to problems in the first place. Carney said: \"Banks can be confident that, when they want to use our facilities, they will be allowed to access them. Because we are both the supervisor and the central bank, the strong presumption is now that, if a bank meets the supervisory threshold conditions to operate and has signed up to our framework, it will be able to use our facilities. \"Our Discount Window will be open every day for those firms requiring a bespoke facility with lagged disclosure. \"Its price will be lower. We will hold monthly repo auctions to provide predictable and regular access to high-quality collateral in exchange for a very broad range of collateral. \"And in times of actual or prospective stressed conditions we stand ready to provide cheap, plentiful money through more frequent auctions.\" The governor insisted that financial institutions would not be excused from managing their balance sheets prudently. Individual banks would have to keep more of their assets in liquid form in order that the Bank of England's facilities could be less stringent and more effective. \"The UK's financial sector can be both a global good and a national asset \u2013 if it is resilient. It is not for the Bank of England to decide how big the financial sector should be. \"Our job is to ensure that it is safe. The UK can host a large and expanding financial sector safely, if we implement a reform agenda that extends well beyond domestic banking,\" Carney said. \"The Bank of England's task is to ensure that the UK can host a large and expanding financial sector in a way that promotes financial stability. \"Only then can it be both a global good and a national asset.\" Asked if Britain had turned the corner, Carney said: \"One reason to think there could be some traction in the recovery is that the core of the financial system has got a lot better.\"",

      "bodyText": "Car production in the UK has continued its upward surge with more than 1.5m vehicles built over the past 12 months \u2013 a volume unmatched since the financial crisis began. Boosted by a buoyant domestic market, as well as demand for luxury models in the far east, almost 10% more cars, 140,888, were produced last month than in September 2012. The month's tally pushes the total for the year to 1,125,433 units, nearly 4% more than were made in the first nine months of 2012. Mike Hawes, the chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), said: \"Boosted by strong domestic demand, September's 9.9% rise in car manufacturing reinforces how the sector is one of the UK's biggest success stories of recent years. \"This year alone, more than \u00a32.6bn has been committed across the UK automotive sector, from the supply chain to global car manufacturing brands. \"This long-term financial commitment and robust demand for UK-built products demonstrate the global appetite for high-quality, desirable products borne of the UK's world-class design, R&amp;D and engineering.\" Cheap financing deals and growing British consumer confidence in an economic recovery has seen the UK buck the sliding sales elsewhere in Europe with unparalleled sales growth, helping to drive up the new production figures. Nissan, the largest manufacturer among the 30 automotive brands manufacturing 70 models in the UK, recently announced that its Sunderland plant would move to 24-hour production in the new year to meet demand. The plant is also the European base for production of the all-electric Leaf car. Booming exports of luxury brands have also underpinned production, with Jaguar Land Rover, the Tata-owned carmaker whose three UK plants employ 26,000 people, recently reporting sales for the first three quarters of 2013 had already outstripped 2012's annual total. The car production figures will be a further boost to coalition hopes of sustained recovery, particularly with its stated aim of rebalancing Britain's economy back towards manufacturing. Last year's car exports, at over \u00a330bn, accounted for 10% of UK exports and that figure looks set to rise. The prime minister's office, @David_Cameron, tweeted: \"Great to see a sharp rise in car manufacturing in the UK. More than a million cars have been made so far this year. #GlobalRace\". While car production continued to rise, the SMMT reported that manufacturing of commercial vehicles was down by 27% year-on-year. Hawes said the \"subdued\" figures were down to continuing uncertainty in the EU and restructuring of UK operations, adding: \"While the overall market is striving against tough conditions, there remains cause for optimism in some areas, with the truck sector outperforming the market in September.\"",

      "bodyText": "One of the world's largest investment banks told ministers ahead of the Royal Mail flotation that they could sell the postal business for \u00a310bn, around two and a half times more than the government finally received for it. News of the valuation from JP Morgan re-ignited the huge row over the privatisation with Billy Hayes, the postal workers union leader, claiming a \"conspiracy against the taxpayer\" and demanding the sacking of Vince Cable as business secretary. The government sold shares in Royal Mail for 330p each, valuing the business at \u00a33.3bn on 11 October. But the shares rocketed in value by almost 40% that day alone and closed at 529p, making the company worth more than \u00a35bn. The official float figure excluded around \u00a3800m of debt, which included would give the state-owned business an \"enterprise value\" of \u00a34.1bn but still almost \u00a36bn lower than the price tag suggested by JP Morgan. The US bank declined to comment but well-placed sources confirmed the figure of \u00a310bn and made clear that others pitching to sell the Royal Mail on behalf of the government had also priced the mail company as high as \u00a37bn. The Department of Business said a whole range of different price tags had been put on Royal Mail at different stages of the sell-off process which was conducted in the most thorough way. \"The banks' proposals came months before any threat of strike action by the unions, financial market uncertainty in the United States and other factors which the government has already said were taken into consideration in setting a price for the company in September,\" said a spokesman. Hayes, the general secretary of the Communication Workers Union, said: \"On the opening day of the flotation Vince Cable wrote off the undervaluation as froth. A week later, we were told it was the fault of the CWU. We now have a prima facie case of a conspiracy against the UK taxpayer who were opposed to the sale and have now been robbed of billions. In any other walk of life this would be a sacking offence and we call on Vince Cable to resign. A full inquiry should be launched into the mis-handling of this unnecessary privatisation by Vince Cable. We would also like the matter to be referred to the public accounts committee to scrutinise how badly the taxpayer has been left out of pocket. Chuka Umunna, the shadow business secretary, said the development only added to fears that taxpayers have been significantly \"short-changed by David Cameron's Royal Mail fire sale\". He added: \"Vince Cable has said that taxpayer value was 'central' to the government's strategy in selling Royal Mail but given the extensive consultation with institutional investors and banks which took place, both he and the prime minister have serious questions to answer. \"Crucially, they must explain when the Government was made aware that the sale was so massively oversubscribed by major investors and why, having considered a higher price, they rejected that option. \"We have called for a full investigation into this matter so it is welcome that the National Audit Office has announced it will be looking into the deal and publishing its findings in the Spring.\"But Whitehall sources said it was not surprising that banks pitching for business might overplay the value of Royal Mail in the hope that they would win the work. They said it was like an estate agent coming round to have a look at a house and trying to persuade the owners to hire them by offering the best price available, but without the full knowledge at that point of all the circumstances. Over 21 investment banks offered their services in May and their appointment was overseen by another City institution, Lazard. The spokesman for the Department of Business added yesterday: \"The proposals included indicative valuations of the company based, in many instances, solely on information already in the public domain. Banks made their own assumptions of Royal Mail's future performance. The range was wide with the median around \u00a33.6bn taking into account [an] IPO [initial public offering] discount.\" Among the banks that did win the work were Goldman Sachs and UBS.",

    "webTitle": "Economics students aim to tear up free-market syllabus", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Few mainstream economists predicted the global financial crash of 2008 and academics have been accused of acting as cheerleaders for the often labyrinthine financial models behind the crisis. Now a growing band of university students are plotting a quiet revolution against orthodox free-market teaching, arguing that alternative ways of thinking have been pushed to the margins. Economics undergraduates at the University of Manchester have formed the Post-Crash Economics Society, which they hope will be copied by universities across the country. The organisers criticise university courses for doing little to explain why economists failed to warn about the global financial crisis and for having too heavy a focus on training students for City jobs. A growing number of top economists, such as Ha-Joon Chang, who teaches economics at Cambridge University, are backing the students. Next month the society plans to publish a manifesto proposing sweeping reforms to the University of Manchester's curriculum, with the hope that other institutions will follow suit. Joe Earle, a spokesman for the Post-Crash Economics Society and a final-year undergraduate, said academic departments were \"ignoring the crisis\" and that, by neglecting global developments and critics of the free market such as Keynes and Marx, the study of economics was \"in danger of losing its broader relevance\". Chang, who is a reader in the political economy of development at Cambridge, said he agreed with the society's premise. The teaching of economics was increasingly confined to arcane mathematical models, he said. \"Students are not even prepared for the commercial world. Few [students] know what is going on in China and how it influences the global economic situation. Even worse, I've met American students who have never heard of Keynes.\" In June a network of young economics students, thinkers and writers set up Rethinking Economics, a campaign group to challenge what they say is the predominant narrative in the subject. Earle said students across Britain were being taught neoclassical economics \"as if it was the only theory\". He said: \"It is given such a dominant position in our modules that many students aren't even aware that there are other distinct theories out there that question the assumptions, methodologies and conclusions of the economics we are taught.\" Multiple-choice and maths questions dominate the first two years of economics degrees, which Earle said meant most students stayed away from modules that required reading and essay-writing, such as history of economic thought. \"They think they just don't have the skills required for those sorts of modules and they don't want to jeopardise their degree,\" he said. \"As a consequence, economics students never develop the faculties necessary to critically question, evaluate and compare economic theories, and enter the working world with a false belief about what economics is and a knowledge base limited to neoclassical theory.\" In the decade before the 2008 crash, many economists dismissed warnings that property and stock markets were overvalued. They argued that markets were correctly pricing shares, property and exotic derivatives in line with economic models of behaviour. It was only when the US sub-prime mortgage market unravelled that banks realised a collective failure to spot the bubble had wrecked their finances. In his 2010 documentary Inside Job, Charles Ferguson highlighted how US academics had produced hundreds of reports in support of the types of high-risk trading and debt-fuelled consumption that triggered the crash. Some leading economists have criticised university economics teaching, among them Paul Krugman, a Nobel prize winner and professor at Princeton university who has attacked the complacency of economics education in the US. In an article for the New York Times in 2009, Krugman wrote: \"As I see it, the economics profession went astray because economists, as a group, mistook beauty, clad in impressive-looking mathematics, for truth.\" Adam Posen, head of the Washington-based thinktank the Peterson Institute, said universities ignore empirical evidence that contradicts mainstream theories in favour of \"overly technical nonsense\". City economists attacked Joseph Stiglitz, the former World Bank chief economist, and Olivier Blanchard, the current International Monetary Fund chief economist, when they criticised western governments for cutting investment in the wake of the crash. A Manchester University spokeman said that, as at other university courses around the world, economics teaching at Manchester \"focuses on mainstream approaches, reflecting the current state of the discipline\". He added: \"It is also important for students' career prospects that they have an effective grounding in the core elements of the subject. \"Many students at Manchester study economics in an interdisciplinary context alongside other social sciences, especially philosophy, politics and sociology. Such students gain knowledge of different kinds of approaches to examining social phenomena \u2026 many modules taught by the department centre on the use of quantitative techniques. These could just as easily be deployed in mainstream or non-mainstream contexts.\"",

      "body": "<p>Few mainstream economists predicted the global financial crash of 2008 and academics have been accused of acting as cheerleaders for the often labyrinthine financial models behind the crisis. Now a growing band of university students are plotting a quiet revolution against orthodox free-market teaching, arguing that alternative ways of thinking have been pushed to the margins.</p> <p>Economics undergraduates at the University of Manchester have formed the <a href=\"http://www.post-crasheconomics.com\" title=\"\">Post-Crash Economics Society</a>, which they hope will be copied by universities across the country. The organisers criticise university courses for doing little to explain why economists failed to warn about the global financial crisis and for having too heavy a focus on training students for City jobs.</p> <p>A growing number of top economists, such as Ha-Joon Chang, who teaches economics at Cambridge University, are backing the students.</p> <p>Next month the society plans to publish a manifesto proposing sweeping reforms to the University of Manchester's curriculum, with the hope that other institutions will follow suit.</p> <p>Joe Earle, a spokesman for the Post-Crash Economics Society and a final-year undergraduate, said academic departments were \"ignoring the crisis\" and that, by neglecting global developments and critics of the free market such as Keynes and Marx, the study of economics was \"in danger of losing its broader relevance\".</p> <p>Chang, who is a reader in the political economy of development at Cambridge, said he agreed with the society's premise. The teaching of economics was increasingly confined to arcane mathematical models, he said. \"Students are not even prepared for the commercial world.

They got a day's notice and it was: that's it - finished. Those plants are run by contractors. There are more of them than the employees of Ineos. I'm a foodie guy and most of what I do is the restaurant which is mainly locals but in the bar normally that table and that table would be contractors and they come here to watch the football.</p> <p>The industrial tourists from south of the border spend more than the locals. They're out every night of the week and they eat out every night. At an educated guess the bar business is down by about a third. If Grangemouth closed it would affect me big time. It's going into the realms of the unknown. We've just spent \u00a3350,000 renovating the place because the plant was almost a guarantee of business. And we've also got \u00a3600,000 of flats which we rent to contractors.</p> <p>What worries me is that the housing market could take another hit and we could struggle to sell them off because other people will be doing the same thing.</p> <p>All the industrial estates round here are full of businesses that work for Grangemouth.

Nobody from Unite has come to us. I'm a shop steward and I'm not happy with them. What Ineos offered them [permanent staff], I'd bite your right arm off for it.</p> <p>Contractors are already on a 30-day consultation and have been since October 11. The contracting companies here will be losing thousands because of this, or even millions for the big ones. I live day to day and contractors are used to being laid off but I've never been laid off when there's so much work we could be doing in there. We're not getting answers off Ineos and the union isn't giving us answers. I'm upset with Unite and the way they have gone about their business. Hindsight is a great thing.

      "bodyText": "Time for a summary of the situation tonight: \u2022 Politicians, unions and Ineos management have been locked in talks today in a bid to reverse the closure of the Grangemouth petrochemicals plant, and get its refinery arm working again. The future of one of Scotland's most important industrial sites remains in the balance though, with at least 130 contractors being laid off today as the plant stays shuttered. The plant was thrown a lifeline this morning when the Unite union has accepted the survival plan which had previously been rejected by its members. Its general secretary, Len McCluskey, is now leading the negotiations -- having travelled to Grangemouth after Ineos stunned Scotland by announcing the closure of the site yesterday. \u2022 McCluskey told reporters that Unite will not let the plant close, and that he was optimistic for its future. \u2022 Alistair Carmichael, the Secretary of State for Scotland, and John Swinney, the Scottish governments' finance minister, made a show of solidarity at Grangemouth. Both men said their administrations were still prepared to do everything possible to save jobs and keep Grangemouth running. However, both men warned that the plant was not yet safe -- although the situation is brighter than yesterday. Highlights start here. \u2022 The plant's future will be decided by Ineos's founder, and majority shareholder, Jim Ratcliffe. The Swiss-based firm is expected to release a statement on Friday. \u2022 The people of Grangemouth now face an uncertain future. Contractors, who outnumber Ineos staff, are in limbo. We understand that 130 Babcock workers were let go this afternoon One pub and restaurant owner explained to my colleague Sean Farrell how these temporary workers help support the local economy. Here's a flavour of PA's latest story. I don't think we're going to get a breakthrough tonight. If we do, we'll cover it on the website so keep watching for more news from Grangemouth and around the world. Goodnight. GW Sean Farrell's sources in Grangemouth confirm that some contractors were being laid off today. That includes 130 Babcock workers who were told to pack up at 3pm - such as welders and pipe fitters. There will be more tomorrow, Sean's source adds. Another contractor says close to 800 have already been laid off in the last week or so. Ineos is planning to issue a statement on the situation tomorrow, according to both the BBC and the Press Association. Here's PA's latest take: The owners of the giant Grangemouth site are considering a last-ditch offer by the union at the centre of the crisis to \"embrace\" a survival plan aimed at preventing the loss of thousands of jobs. A flurry of meetings were held throughout the day, with Unite saying it was working to persuade owners Ineos to reverse its shock decision to close the petrochemical complex. General secretary Len McCluskey said the union had decided they had to embrace the survival plan, \"warts and all\", in the wake of the closure decision. Managers were said to be discussing \"everything that has been said\", before deciding whether to reverse the decision to close the petrochemical side of its business, with the loss of 800 direct jobs and up to 2,000 contractors. An announcement from the company is expected tomorrow. Meanwhile, UK government officials admitted it would be a \"challenge\" to find another company to buy the business, which Ineos has said is losing \u00a310 million a month. The losses, scale of investment needed to upgrade the site, coupled with the industrial relations would all have to be considered by any potential buyer, officials said. But they insisted there would be no shortage of fuel supplies as a result of the dispute, which has led to the petrochemical site and adjoining oil refinery being closed for the past week. \"We don't envisage there will be shortages,\" said one official. One of the surprising things about Grangemouth is how run-down it is, writes Sean Farrell from the scene. This picture shows a discoloured, ragged Ineos flag flying behind the Scottish Saltire: A second look at a sign for the Grangemouth Business Centre shows that \"BP\" has been covered up with white tape. A look inside the building shows paintwork that could do with a refresh. Ineos bought Grangemouth from BP in 2006 and says it has invested \u00a31bn since then but its billionaire owner Jim Ratcliffe has made his money partly by hammering down on costs. This is an oil refinery and not Fortnum &amp; Mason but maybe a few quid spent here and there might cheer everyone up if the dispute gets resolved. SF From Grangemouth, Sky's correspondent James Matthews tweets that up to two hundred contractors have just been told they're being laid off: More details as we get it -- but as Sean Farrell explained at 1.27pm, many contractors were already facing an uncertain fate. They also outnumber the number of staff on the Ineos payroll. John Swinney and Alistair Carmichael are giving a clear show of solidarity here, showing that neither the governments in London or Edinburgh have lost hope that the plant can be rescued. In a brief Q&amp;A session, Swinney says that it's clear that the petrochemical site can only be saved if unions and management can reach a deal. He also says there has been \"clear acceptance\" of the Ineos plan by Unite. Asked what they said to Ineos today, Carmichael says that these are not new discussions -- politicians have been talking about the site's future for some time. Swinney reiterates this point, saying that: The discussions and the commitment are the same as we've been involved in for some time. And asked whether they share Len McCluskey's optimism, Carmichael cautions against getting carried away. \"At best there is a better prospect\" of the petrochemical plant staying open, he adds. John Swinney, finance secretary in the Scottish administration, speaks next - saying many families in the area suffered a \"very anxious night last night\" after yesterday's news. Both the Scottish and UK government stand ready to do everything we can to help reverse the closure of the petrochemical plant and to restart the refinery operation very soon, Swinney adds. Alistair Carmichael, Orkney and Shetland MP and Secretary of State for Scotland, speaks first. He says that discussions have been very open and very productive. We are clearly in different situation today, now that Unite have said they will accept the Ineos survival plan, he says. Carmichael added that both government are committed to saving the plant. Recent events have had no impact at all on that commitment. Heads-up -- the two senior politicians at Grangemouth, Alistair Carmichael and John Swinney are giving a statement to the media now, after their meeting with Ineos management. It's on BBC News 24 and Sky News Sky's correspondent in Grangemouth, James Matthews, reports that Ineos management are drafting a \"formal legal agreement\" for Unite to sign, confirming that the union will abide by the survival plan for Grangemouth (as Len McCluskey has pledged they will do). Meetings are still continuing between Ineos, Unite, the Scottish finance minister, John Swinney (who spoke earlier) and Secretary of State for Scotland, Alistair Carmichael. The nearest pub to the Grangemouth site is the most hospitable Abbotsich bar and restaurant about three-quarters of a mile up the Bo'Ness Road as you head into town. The owner, Gary Horne, has his finger on the pulse and he told my colleague Sean Farrellabout the importance of contractors to the local economy: \"Most of our customers are workers [at Grangemouth] but also we have property to let solely for contractors and it's my job to know what's going on. The flats are easy to get into and easy to get out of for people working short term. Most of my contractors are at the BP Kinneil terminal and one or two from the Grangemouth refinery who are hanging on. There were hundreds and hundreds of guys laid off in the last week or so. They got a day's notice and it was: that's it - finished. Those plants are run by contractors. There are more of them than the employees of Ineos. I'm a foodie guy and most of what I do is the restaurant which is mainly locals but in the bar normally that table and that table would be contractors and they come here to watch the football. The industrial tourists from south of the border spend more than the locals. They're out every night of the week and they eat out every night. At an educated guess the bar business is down by about a third. If Grangemouth closed it would affect me big time. It's going into the realms of the unknown. We've just spent \u00a3350,000 renovating the place because the plant was almost a guarantee of business. And we've also got \u00a3600,000 of flats which we rent to contractors. What worries me is that the housing market could take another hit and we could struggle to sell them off because other people will be doing the same thing. All the industrial estates round here are full of businesses that work for Grangemouth. They have to be within radio distance because no one's allowed a mobile phone so they have to be within a mile or two. Everyone works for the BP [Grangemouth].\" Back to the Grangemouth dispute, and Labour leader Ed Miliband said he had discussed the crisis with Unite. He said the union officials \"fully understand the gravity of this situation\". I've taken the quotes from PA: I have spoken to them, and I think they fully understand the gravity of this situation. They want to represent their members, and rightly so, and they're concerned about their members' jobs and livelihoods. I have a concern about that but also making sure that we have proper energy supplies for this country. That's why it's a national asset. I think we've seen very significant movement on the union side, rightly calling off the industrial action - the strike - and now looking like they're open to changes on the terms and conditions. Now that is a matter for them but I think that is encouraging because I want to see this dispute settled, I want to see those jobs saved. I think that's what the union wants to see, and I hope that's what the employer wants to see. Over in America, we've just seen the first sign of the damage caused by its government shutdown earlier this month month. Markit, the data firm, reported that factory output shrank in October for the first time since the end of 2009, while overall activity grew at its weakest rate in a year. Its preliminary US manufacturing PMI fell to 51.1, the lowest since October 2012, from 52.8 in September, indicating slower growth. The output subindex dropped for the first time in more than four years, to 49.5 from 55.3. Any reading below 50 indicates a contraction. Markit chief economist Chris Williamson said it was impossible to disentangle the impact of the shutdown from other economic factors, but added: [it] suggests that the disruptions and uncertainty caused by the crisis hit companies hard. Not great news for the US, or the wider global economy. We learned earlier today that the eurozone private sector is growing less quickly than expected, although Chinese activity hit a seven month high. Scottish Power has announced that it is hiking its domestic dual fuel prices by 8.6%. The average annual bill will rise by \u00a3113, as Scottish Power becomes the latest UK utility to hit customers with an inflation-busting tariff hike. Gas prices will increase by an average of 8.5% and electricity prices by an average of 9.0%, from 6th December 2013. It blamed the usual \"rising costs\" for the move, namely: 7% increase in the costs of the gas and electricity purchased on wholesale markets 11% increase in the costs of delivering gas and electricity to our customers\u2019 homes 16% increase in the costs of compulsory environmental and social schemes Those \"compulsory environmental and social schemes\" were criticised by prime minister David Cameron this week, after former PM John Major stirred up the debate by suggesting the government should impose windfall taxes on the industry. Cameron vowed yesterday to roll geen taxes back, while this morning deputy PM Nick Clegg suggested some could be moved to general taxation instead. Clegg also defended the warm homes discount. Here's the statement: ScottishPower To Increase Domestic Dual Fuel Prices By An Average Of 8.6% To Recover Rising Costs And here's a graphic from it: Just two days ago, Scottish Power was ordered to pay \u00a38.5m to customers after misleading them about the cost of charges, consumption and tariffs. This makes Scottish Power the fourth energy supplier to raise its prices. We're still waiting for EDF and E.ON. SSE is raising its prices by 8.2%, British Gas by 9.2%, while nPower is imposing a double-digit rise of 10.4%. Interviewed on BBC News 24, Scotland finance minister John Swinney says Grangemouth is in \" a much better place than yesterday... but we've not crossed the line yet\". Speaking before heading for meetings with Ineos and Unite, Swinney said he hopes to make progress today towards an agreement on the future of the plant. He said Unite had made a \"helpful step forward\" this morning, by saying it would embrace the Ineos's rescue plan. Could the Scottish government provide funds to guarantee Grangemouth's future? He said the Scottish government \"stands ready to be a part and player\" in any deal to secure jobs * Could there be a new buyer for the site? People would expect the Scottish government to be making contingency plans, John Swinney says. His priority today, though, is to make progress towards a deal to reverse the decision to shut the site. [* - for background: Ineos's chairman Jim Ratcliffe was seeking loan guarantees and grants from ministers in London and Edinburgh, as part of the \u00a3300m+ scheme to upgrade the site] John Swinney MSP, Scotland's finance secretary, has arrived at the Grangemouth site to hold talks with Ineos management and Unite officials Journalists at the scene report that Swinney said he was optimistic a breakthrough can be reached. The Grangemouth workers who feel particularly aggrieved about the plant's closure are the thousands of contract staff who work on the site, reports my colleague Sean Farrell. From Grangemouth, Sean explains: Their jobs range from cleaning through scaffolding to more specialised work. Estimates of 2,000 contractors \u2013 compared with about 1,370 permanent employees \u2013 probably fall short because many hundreds are brought in for regular projects often lasting months. Workers report that as Ineos prepared for last week's shutdown, hundreds of contractors were laid off, including manual labourers earning only \u00a3200 or \u00a3300 a week. A hotel owner who gets lots of business from putting up contract workers said that regulars have simply disappeared since last Monday as the shutdown loomed. And here's what a contract worker outside Grangemouth's plant told Sean earlier today: Everyone talks about the Ineos workers but I'm a contract worker and I've been here four years. Contractors' business is in limbo now. Nobody from Unite has come to us. I'm a shop steward and I'm not happy with them. What Ineos offered them [permanent staff], I'd bite your right arm off for it. Contractors are already on a 30-day consultation and have been since October 11. The contracting companies here will be losing thousands because of this, or even millions for the big ones. I live day to day and contractors are used to being laid off but I've never been laid off when there's so much work we could be doing in there. We're not getting answers off Ineos and the union isn't giving us answers. I'm upset with Unite and the way they have gone about their business. Hindsight is a great thing. Everybody has gone through hard times and there are hundreds of guys' jobs on the line. They should have taken [Jim] Ratcliffe's offer straight away. He's not daft - he's a billionaire. Len McCluskey has told Ineos's management at Grangemouth that he's prepared to meet with Jim Ratcliffe, the founder and chairman of the company, in a bid to save jobs at the site: Unite tweets the news: Ineos's management are due to meet with Alistair Carmichael, the UK Scottish secretary, and John Swinney, Scotland\u2019s finance secretary, and Unite representatives this afternoon. Some Twitter reaction to the latest developments: And here's Len McCluskey on Sky News earlier: The BBC has uploaded a video clip of Len McCluskey speaking at Grangemouth after his meeting with Unite's shop stewards, and Ineos representatives. As reported earlier, McCluskey explains that Unite has presented a \"positive response\" to Ineos's survival plan for the plant, adding that he is \"optimistic\" that the site can be saved. It's online here. David Watt of the Institute of Directors isn't as optimistic for the future of the Grangemouth's petrochemical site as Len McCluskey, despite Unite's offer to embrace the survival plan. Speaking on BBC News 24, Watt warns that \"there's not a long queue of people who want to buy this plant\", if Ineos were to continue with its plan to not reopen it. In the long term, he reckons that it could be transformed into a new, profitable operation after 2017, but needs to reduce its losses very quickly in the meantime. In Westminster, David Cameron's spokesman has welcomed today's negotiations between Unite and Ineos's management. A Downing Street spokesman said: The Prime Minister is keen that they are back round the table talking. Clearly, we want both sides to continue with those talks and come to a solution if possible. Grangemouth is clearly of vital importance to the Scottish economy and the Prime Minister is keen that those discussions continue and hopefully they can find a solution. Asked whether Mr Cameron might make a personal intervention in the dispute, the spokesman said: The Government in Westminster is working very closely with the Scottish Government, and the Prime Minister is clearly in charge of the Westminster Government. (quotes via PA) My colleague Sean Farrell has been speaking to workers at Grangemouth today. One shop steward told him that the union was engaged in a \"last gasp\" effort to negotiate a deal to save 800 people's jobs at the site (shortly before Len McCluskey announced that the union was embracing the rescue plan) Another accused Ineos acting in a \"shocking\" and \"unpredictable\" way, by acting so quickly to close the petrochemical operations at Grangemouth. Len McCluskey also suggested that the site's owners had been hasty, saying this morning that the proposed rescue plan had been presented \"almost as a fait accompli\". Interviewed on Sky News outside the plant, Len McCluskey reiterated that Unite has made concessions at this morning's talks with Ineos. McCluskey said he had told Ineos that: We are prepared to embrace their survival plan and get into discussions about the future of the site. He also repeated that \"this plant is too important to be allowed to close\". Asked whether Unite was agreeing to Ineos's original proposal in full, McCluskey explained that Unite had told Ineos that \"we've accepted the route you want to go down\", and would now sit down with immediate effect to discuss how to save the site. Clearly Ineos's decision yesterday to liquidate the petrochemicals' arm has shaken Unite into changing its position. Len McCluskey didn't say exactly what Unite have just agreed to, but it appears the union has now accepted that workers must accept the pay freeze and pension cuts that were rejected by members earlier this week. The Unite chief also denied that his union had been \"humiliated\" by events at Grangemouth, saying there is \"nothing humiliating\" about defending workers' jobs and the Scottish economy. And speaking on Sky News shortly afterwards, McCluskey said: I'm optimistic that the olive branch being offered to Ineos will be taken up. Big News from Grangemouth: Len McCluskey, general secretary of Unite, has announced that the union have told Ineos that they will embrace the rescue plan, at this morning's emergency talks. Speaking after meeting with Ineos management, McCluskey said that Unite \"was not going to allow this plant to close down\". We are not going to let 800 jobs go and see Grangemouth turn into a ghost town, said McCluskey, speaking live on BBC News 24. McCluskey continued that he is now \"very positive\" that the plant can stay open, and hopes Ineos's shareholders will now be prepared to invest in the plant. He said: It's now in the hands of Ineos on whether they are the ones who own the chemical plant, or whether along with the Scottish Government and the UK government we need to seek another owner. More to follow.... Ineos director Tom Crotty has denied that the firm lured unions into a trap over Grangemouth. Speaking on BBC News 24 few minutes ago, Crotty rejected the suggestion that Ineos has wanted to shut the plan all along, and used the unpalatable cost-cutting plan as a way of forcing the union's hand. If staff had voted in favour, he argued, Ineos would have invested \u00a3300m and the plant would soon be reopening. Crotty reiterated that Ineos will consult with shareholders again if the Unite union substantially alters its position and accepts major changes at the plant. It's a quiet morning in Europe's stock markets, with the FTSE 100 gaining 20 points to 6694. Here's Nick Fletcher's early market report: FTSE moves higher as miners gain ground after Chinese data Len McCluskey, the general secretary of Unite, is in Grangemouth today taking part in the last-ditch negotiations over whether the petrochemical plant can be saved. With hundreds of jobs in the balance, my colleague Sean Farrell is outside the plant and reports that union officials and management are locked in talks inside. No-one has yet come out to speak to the assembled media. The front page of today's Evening Times shows the anger in Scotland over the Grangemouth petrochemicals plant closure, and the separate loss of 140 jobs at a chemical factory run by BASF in Paisley. The Scottish Government also hasn't given up hope, and is still prepared to help keep the Grangemouth plant running. Finance minister John Swinney told Good Morning Scotland he still hoped for a breakthrough at \"this very, very, very late stage in the process\", saying: Everybody is agreed that this plant has a strong future with the necessary investment and that is why the Scottish Government is wiling to be a player in that. We are now in a position at the very late stage of having the opportunity to have a discussion about some of the substantive issues that will affect the financial future of the plant and I hope that discussion this morning is constructive and successful. Ineos would take Unite's new proposal for Grangemouth to its shareholders if it presents a \"very significant\" change of position, according to company director Tom Crotty. Crotty told BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme that management will listen to Unite at today's meeting, adding: If they believe there are substantive differences in where we are now then clearly they have a duty to take that back to the shareholders. The shareholders met after the vote on Monday and, quite understandably in my opinion, took a view that if the workforce had rejected that \u00a3300 million investment, then how were they going to go ahead and make it if the workforce were not behind that? That is why the closure announcement has been made. There's a profile of Ineos's multimillionaire chairman, Jim Ratcliffe, in today's Financial Times. which says he's \"long tired\" of running businesses in Britain. Hull-born Ratcliffe, 61, grew Ineos through an acquisition spree, and apparently recently told the FT that the UK was proving increasingly expensive. The paper also suggests that Ratcliffe feels betrayed by the unions after a strike back in 2008. Here's a flavour: \u201cIt\u2019s always been hard work for us to manufacture in the UK,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a particularly profitable place for us.\u201d The way he tells it, the business environment in Britain is bad and getting worse. Energy is expensive, logistics are costly, skills are \u201cmiddle to poor\u201d and unions resist change. Pension costs, meanwhile, are \u201coutrageous\u201d. \u201cThe UK is one of the few places in the world that has final salary pensions,\u201d he said. This gloomy assessment, in a recent interview with the Financial Times, came just weeks before Ineos formally announced it was closing its Grangemouth chemicals plant \u2013 and suggests the move had been in the works for months, and possibly years The full piece: Grangemouth owner: \u2018manufacturing in the UK has always been hard\u2019 We now have confirmation that private sector growth in the eurozone is slipping this month, defying expectations of stronger growth. It's a worrying sign for firms, individuals and policymakers in the euro area and beyond. Although there's no suggestion that the eurozone is slipping back into recession, it may mean more stimulus measures are needed. Markit's 'flash' reading of the sector shows that growth is slowing. Its composite purchasing managers' index (PMI) fell to 51.5 from September's two-year high of 52.2. Any reading above 50 suggests a rise in activity. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said the results were \"clearly disappointing\", adding that it would be \"unwise to read too much into one month\u2019s data\" (not that this stops Markit releasing PMI data twice each month - we get final data for October in a fortnight...) Today's figures suggest the eurozone will post economic growth of just 0.1% to 0.2% in the current quarter. Williamson added: The dip in the PMI will remind policymakers that a sustainable upturn is by no means assured, and adds confirmation to the ECB\u2019s view that the recovery is slow, uneven and fragile. Attention is likely to be focused on whether the region requires more policy action to boost the recovery rather than on the timing of any withdrawal of stimulus As reported earlier - France appears to be stagnating, while Germany is growing less briskly. On the upside, Europe's private firms have now been reporting growth for four months. Speaking on Radio 4's Today programme, deputy prime minister Nick Clegg warned that the Grangemouth site (whose refinery arm produces 210,000 barrels of oil each day) is an \"important part\" of the UK's economic infrastructure. Clegg added that the future of Grangemouth is simply too crucial to become a \"party political football\" Back to Grangemouth -- my colleague Haroon Siddique writes: Union leaders are to meet managers at the Grangemouth petrochemicals site in Scotland in a bid to save thousands of jobs after its owner abruptly closed the plant in a bitter industrial dispute. Unite said it had made a number of recommendations to Ineos, which announced the closure of the plant on Wednesday with up to 800 petrochemical workers set to lose their jobs. The decision, announced after the workforce failed to accept management demands for radical changes to their employment terms and conditions, also threatens the positions of at least 600 employees at the oil refinery on the same site, which Ineos has refused to rule out closing, as well as 2,000 contract staff. A union spokesman said on Thursday: \"Unite has made recommendations to Ineos as way to save jobs [sic] and prevent needless harm to this plant and the local community. \"We meet with the company today and will hear then if they share these objectives.\" Here's the full story: Grangemouth union to meet Ineos in bid to save petrochemicals plant October also hasn't been a great month for Germany's private sector - new data from Markit shows it is growing at the slowest pace in three months. Reuters sums it up: Markit's preliminary composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), which tracks growth in both the manufacturing and services sector and covers more than two-thirds of the economy, slipped to 52.6 in October from 53.2 the previous month. The reading was above the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction for a sixth straight month, but marked the lowest level since July as the services sector performed less well than expected. \"Germany's private sector started the final quarter of 2013 in a positive fashion,\" said Tim Moore, an economist at Markit. \"A slower rate of expansion in services activity meant that overall growth eased slightly from the trend recorded over the third quarter.\" And here's a handy graph showing German business activity (blue) against official economic growth (orange): But there's a sliver of good news from Spain, where the unemployment rate inched down to 26% in the last three months, from 26.3% in the previous quarter. French business activity is stagnating this month, according to the latest assessment of its private companies. Data provider Markit reported that French service sector only posted modest growth during October, while manufacturers reported a drop in activity. The amount of incoming new business fell. This 'flash' reading suggests the French economy, which posted decent data in September, is finding this month more of a struggle. More here. Sky News are also reporting that a late u-turn is possible in Grangemouth: The owner of the Grangemouth petrochemicals plant says it could reverse Wednesday's decision to close it if \"substantive\" talks today yield union concessions. The talks in Grangemouth were due to start a few minutes ago, at 8am BST. Ineos took the decision to shut the plant after around half the site's workers rejected the offer of a pay and bonus freeze until 2016, and an end to its final salary pension scheme. But overnight, news broke that the unions were reconsidering. As the BBC news website puts it, \"the Unite union appeared to be shifting its position and ready to accept the survival plan\" (more here). Here's Press Association's early take on the situation in Grangemouth this morning, where unions have made new proposals to the site's owners, Ineos: Union leaders are to meet managers at the giant Grangemouth site in a bid to save thousands of jobs following the shock decision to close the petrochemcal side of the business. Unite said it had made a number of recommendations to owner Ineos, which yesterday announced the closure of the petrochemical plant with the loss of 800 jobs and potential 2,000 more among contractors. A union spokesman said: \"Unite has made recommendations to Ineos as way to save jobs and prevent needless harm to this plant and the local community. \"We meet with the company today and will hear then if they share these objectives.\" The company insisted yesterday it had no alternative but to close the business after it failed to persuade its staff to accept a survival plan, which included a pay freeze, ending of a final salary pension scheme and other changes to terms and conditions. Ineos said white-collar workers such as admin staff had backed the plan, but workers represented by Unite had rejected it. The adjoining oil refinery at Grangemouth will stay open, although the entire site has been closed for the past week as a result of the dispute. Almost 1,400 workers are employed at Grngemouth, Scotland's biggest industrial site. Politicians have urged the two sides to resume talks to prevent the closure, while efforts are expected to be made to find a potential buyer. Ineos said it had been losing \u00a310 million a month at Grangemouth. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of events across the financial market, the world economy, the eurozone and the business world. There's lots afoot today, both at home and abroad. In Scotland, the race is on to save jobs at the Grangemouth plant. Union leaders and management will hold new talks today, following the grim news yesterday that the petrochemicals arm is to be shut. Could there be a breakthrough? There are reports this morning that unions at the plant could make concessions in a bid to reverse the closure. It's also a busy day for economic news, with new data due shortly showing how the eurozone's key services and manufacturing sectors are performing. We've already seen new data from China, where manufacturing output jumped to a seven month high in September. As Bloomberg explains: China\u2019s manufacturing strengthened more than anticipated this month, a sign the recovery is gaining momentum as leaders struggle with surging home prices and local-government debt. This graph shows the details: And later today, EU leaders will be gathering for a Council meeting. Until recently, the future of the eurozone would have topped the agenda. Not any more. Indeed, reports that US intelligence tapped Angela Merkel's mobile phone may overshadow the whole event. I'll be tracking events through the day, as usual....",

Talk of increasing liquidity in the shares cut little ice, especially since Ashley still owns 61.7% of the business he founded.

      "bodyText": "When a key figure in a company sells shares, it's hard to blame other investors when they follow suit. So confirmation that Mike Ashley had cashed in \u00a3106m worth of shares in Sports Direct International - 2.7% of the retailer - at 662.5p each made the company the biggest faller in the FTSE 100. Talk of increasing liquidity in the shares cut little ice, especially since Ashley still owns 61.7% of the business he founded. The disposal follows news of a 15.1% rise in sales in the nine weeks to September, and comes as the shares have risen nearly 60% in the last six months. Ashley's shares were bought by Goldman Sachs who then sold them on to institutional investors. Supporters of Newcastle United - which Ashley also controls - may be hoping he will splash some cash on new players, but they may be wise not to hold their breath on this. Sports Direct lost 27p to 685p, going against the grain of a rising market, with positive Chinese manufacturing figures lifting mining shares and a number of positive corporate updates. The FTSE 100 finished 38.70 points higher at 6713.18, back to a new five month high. The HSBC flash manufacturing index for October in China came in at 50.9, up from 50.4 in October, an optimistic sign for the mining sector since China is such a key customer for commodities. Analyst Cailey Barker at Numis said: The number shows expansion in manufacturing which is likely to continue into fourth quarter. Strong PMI numbers coupled with the view that the US Federal Reserve is unlikely to taper until the first quarter [of 2014] should see mining companies have a strong run into the new year. Vedanta Resources rose 23p to \u00a310.88 while Antofagasta added 8.5p to 874p. Mid-cap miner Kazakhmys climbed 13.6p to 265p after an upbeat third quarter production report. Elsewhere pharmaceuticals group Shire, best known for its hyperactivity treatments, shot to the top of the FTSE 100 after forecast-beating figures. The company reported a 12% rise in third quarter revenues to $1.24bn and a 30% increase in income to $422m, helped by lower than expected research and development costs as it simplified its three previous divisions into one business. It raised its estimates for the full year and is now looking for mid-to-high-teens earnings growth, compared to the double-digit growth it forecast in July. Chief executive Flemming Omskov said: We're confident in our prospects for the longer term as we continue to execute on commercial delivery, progress our prioritized pipeline and focus on targeted M&amp;A. The news sent its shares soaring 235p to \u00a327.60. Analysts also reacted positively to the news, with Morgan Stanley saying: The biggest contributor to the beat was lower operating expenses, which was 8% below consensus forecasts, with the absolute benefit split 60/40 between selling, general and administrative expenses and R&amp;D. Shire is our top pick in EU pharma, offering near- term earnings and pipeline momentum. Although an update on cost-savings at the third quarter was expected, we think the magnitude of the implied upgrades will positively surprise. Accelerating product sales growth (up 13% in the third quarter, up 7% for nine months) is also key. Banks recovered from Wednesday's declines in the wake of the European Central Bank stress tests, with Royal Bank of Scotland up 4.4p at 356.5p and Lloyds Banking Group up 2.21p at 80.12p. Lloyds was confirmed to be in talks to sell Scottish Widows Investment Partnership to Aberdeen Asset Management, up 24.8p at 450.4p, for up to \u00a3500m. Aberdeen plans to issue shares to Lloyds as part of the deal, giving the state owned bank a stake in the fund management group.. WPP added 12p to \u00a313.25, after a 5% rise in third quarter like for like revenues. Rolls-Royce rose 30p to \u00a311.74 after winning a \u00a322m rig contract with Samsung Heavy Industries and an overweight recommendation from JP Morgan Cazenove, although the bank has cut its target price from \u00a315.60 to \u00a314.60. British Land ended 10p higher at 623p on vague bid talk, with interest from Qatar and Abu Dhabi mentioned. Unilever confirmed its recent warning about declines in emerging markets, reporting a 3.2% rise in third quarter sales, down from 5% in the previous three months. Much of the disappointment was already in the price, and its shares edged up 13p to \u00a325.09. Martin Deboo at Investec said: We read the third quarter sales as in line with expectations, no great surprise given the 30 September warning. Of more relevance are the underlying dynamics. These reveal the anticipated big slowdown in emerging markets, a slowdown in Personal Care, flatlining in Foods and a worryingly muted performance in Refreshment. Despite the downbeat tone, Unilever are sticking to full year guidance and their expectation of a better fourth quarter. We keep faith, but continue to urge more radical action on Foods disposals. Among the mid-caps, Ophir Energy jumped more than 9% to 326.7p on news it may sell part of its stakes in three gas fields off the coast of Tanzania. The exploration group said it had started a process to sell down a part interest in the blocks but added the usual caveat: There is no certainty this process will conclude successfully nor can there be any certainty over the value of any such deal if it were to complete. An Indian report said its was talks to sell the stakes to state-run gas company GAIL, but other companies could also be interested, including the Chinese. The Tanzanian fields, which Ophir discovered with partner BG, are estimated to hold 15trn cubic feet of gas but could cost $10bn to develop, hence the need for another investor. But retailer Debenhams dropped 9.7p to 101p after disappointing full year results.",

    "webTitle": "Grangemouth crisis: Unite union now accepts plant rescue plan", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The union at the centre of the Grangemouth crisis has decided to \"embrace\" a survival plan aimed at preventing the site's closure and the loss of thousands of jobs. Unite's leader, Len McCluskey, said the union was working to persuade owners Ineos to reverse its shock decision to close the petrochemical complex. But he denied that the union had been forced into a humiliating climbdown by the plant's owners: \"My union is engaged with thousands of companies every day to negotiate plans to save jobs. There is nothing humiliating about negotiating plans to ensure jobs and communities are safe.\" The development followed a meeting at the site between general secretary Len McCluskey and union shop stewards. McCluskey said the shop stewards had decided they had to embrace the survival plan, \"warts and all\", in the wake of the closure decision. Workers at the petrochemical site, and adjoining oil refinery, had refused to sign up to the plan, which included a pay freeze, ending of the final salary pension scheme, and other changes to terms and conditions. McCluskey said: \"We are not going to let this plant close. We are encouraged by the comments of the First Minister that he too will not let this plant close. \"We have a situation whereby a company has put down an ultimatum and we have to respond. It is not how we engage in modern day industrial relations.\" Ineos is expected to wait until further meetings are held later today involving politicians before responding to the latest development. Ineos director Tom Crotty has denied that the firm lured unions into a trap over Grangemouth. Speaking on BBC News 24, Crotty rejected the suggestion that Ineos has wanted to shut the plan all along, and used the unpalatable cost-cutting plan as a way of forcing the union's hand. If staff had voted in favour, he argued, Ineos would have invested \u00a3300m and the plant would soon be reopening. Crotty reiterated that Ineos will consult with shareholders again if the Unite union substantially alters its position and accepts major changes at the plant. A Downing Street spokesman said: \"The prime minister is keen that they are back round the table talking. Clearly, we want both sides to continue with those talks and come to a solution if possible. \"Grangemouth is clearly of vital importance to the Scottish economy and the Prime Minister is keen that those discussions continue and hopefully they can find a solution.\" Wednesday's closure announcement The government reacted with dismay to Wednesday's announcement and the climate change secretary, Ed Davey, pledged that all efforts would be made to rescue the plant on the Firth of Forth. Grangemouth is Scotland's biggest manufacturing business. Its refinery supplies most of the country's fuel, and the petrochemicals plant produces plastics used in industries ranging from cars to packaging. Its closure would have far-reaching implications for Scotland and the UK. The company said it had no alternative but to shut down the business after it failed to persuade its staff to accept a survival plan. Unite said about 680 of the site's 1,370-strong workforce had rejected the company's proposals, which include a pay freeze for 2014-16, removal of a bonus up to 2016, a reduced shift allowance and the ending of the final-salary pension scheme. Ineos had said it was ready to invest \u00a3300m in Grangemouth, but only if workers agreed to the new terms. It said the plant, which has been shut down since last week because of the dispute, was losing \u00a310m a month. In an urgent question on Grangemouth in parliament on Wednesday, Davey told MPs repeatedly that the government wanted the plant to stay open if at all possible. He said it would still consider a business case to provide investment to help keep the plant running, but Downing Street dismissed speculation that the plant could be nationalised, saying it was a matter for the unions and owner to resolve. The prime minister's spokesman said it was disappointing that the petrochemicals side of the plant had closed and called on both parties to continue their dialogue over the future of the refinery. Number 10 said the closure of the Grangemouth refinery would not pose a threat to fuel supplies, after the AA warned it could hit petrol prices. A dispute over pay and conditions at the oil refinery remains unresolved. Len McCluskey explains Unite's position: \"What's different? The company's closure of the plant has led our stewards to believe the priority is to keep the plant open. We have to say to the company that the survival plan is something we are prepared to embrace and go along with if, if you like. But that includes discussions and consultation and we will see what comes out of those discussions. I wouldn't want to mislead you. Their survival plan requires us to accept certain things and our stewards' position is that we are accepting those issues. \"It's not that it's all up for negotiation. They are demanding we accept their ultimatums and we have decided to accept their ultimatums. The consultation will be around the logistics of those issues and the practicalities of those issues. There will be no doubt some alterations within the context of those discussions. What has changed is the company have closed the plant and have put it into liquidation and we are not going to allow that to happen and the stewards are now responding to the wishes of our members who may feel outraged by what has happened but the priority is to keep the plant open and we will see what the future brings.\" Sean Farrell",

Reports suggested Aberdeen would issue shares to Lloyds as part of the deal. Owen Jones at Shore Capital said:</p> <blockquote> At the current market cap of the group, that would make Lloyds a 10% shareholder of Aberdeen. Such a raise would, by our calculations, dilute earnings by around 9% and push the 2014 PE towards 14.2 times from where it currently stands at 12.9 times. If the deal were to go ahead, it would be against all recent management rhetoric and, indeed, against market expectations. Aberdeen has a long and successful track record of acquiring rival fund management groups, integrating them and stripping out costs. In this instance, we believe there to be significant potential cost savings within SWIP and, therefore, Aberdeen could well be the winner again here. <br> However, much of the money at SWIP, as we understand it, commands very low revenue margins (10-15 basis points) and would therefore be dilutive to the overall group blended yield of around 50 basis points, recent performance has been poor within SWIP and clients have been taking money out over recent periods. The success of this deal depends very much on how keenly Aberdeen are able to price it and how much Lloyds are willing to part with it. However, we would question why Lloyds would want shares in Aberdeen given that they would not help it from a regulatory perspective under Basel III. </blockquote> <p><strong>Sports Direct International</strong> is leading the fallers, down 39.5p at 672.5p after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/oct/23/sports-direct-asos-share-bonanza\" title=\"\">it confirmed founder Mike Ashley had sold 2.7% of the business at 662.5p a share</a> raising \u00a3106m.</p> <p><strong>Unilever</strong> confirmed its recent warning about declines in emerging markets, dipping 2p to \u00a324.94 as it reported a 3.2% rise in third quarter sales, down from 5% in the previous three months. Martin Deboo at Investec said:</p> <blockquote> We read the third quarter sales as in line with expectations, no great surprise given the 30 September warning. Of more relevance are the underlying dynamics. These reveal the anticipated big slowdown in emerging markets, a slowdown in Personal Care, flatlining in Foods and a worryingly muted performance in Refreshment. Despite the downbeat tone, Unilever are sticking to full year guidance and their expectation of a better fourth quarter. We keep faith, but continue to urge more radical action on Foods disposals. <br> </blockquote>",

Such a raise would, by our calculations, dilute earnings by around 9% and push the 2014 PE towards 14.2 times from where it currently stands at 12.9 times. If the deal were to go ahead, it would be against all recent management rhetoric and, indeed, against market expectations. Aberdeen has a long and successful track record of acquiring rival fund management groups, integrating them and stripping out costs. In this instance, we believe there to be significant potential cost savings within SWIP and, therefore, Aberdeen could well be the winner again here. However, much of the money at SWIP, as we understand it, commands very low revenue margins (10-15 basis points) and would therefore be dilutive to the overall group blended yield of around 50 basis points, recent performance has been poor within SWIP and clients have been taking money out over recent periods. The success of this deal depends very much on how keenly Aberdeen are able to price it and how much Lloyds are willing to part with it. However, we would question why Lloyds would want shares in Aberdeen given that they would not help it from a regulatory perspective under Basel III. Sports Direct International is leading the fallers, down 39.5p at 672.5p after it confirmed founder Mike Ashley had sold 2.7% of the business at 662.5p a share raising \u00a3106m. Unilever confirmed its recent warning about declines in emerging markets, dipping 2p to \u00a324.94 as it reported a 3.2% rise in third quarter sales, down from 5% in the previous three months. Martin Deboo at Investec said: We read the third quarter sales as in line with expectations, no great surprise given the 30 September warning. Of more relevance are the underlying dynamics. These reveal the anticipated big slowdown in emerging markets, a slowdown in Personal Care, flatlining in Foods and a worryingly muted performance in Refreshment. Despite the downbeat tone, Unilever are sticking to full year guidance and their expectation of a better fourth quarter. We keep faith, but continue to urge more radical action on Foods disposals.",
