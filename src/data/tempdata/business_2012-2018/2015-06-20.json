      "bodyText": "Britain has been attacked by a senior US official for undermining progress on a global clampdown on tax avoidance by multinationals ahead of an international agreement to be published at the G20 talks in the autumn. Efforts to establish standards that would prevent companies from shifting their profits across borders to avoid taxes are said to have amounted to a \u201ccollective failure\u201d due, in part, to self-interested moves made by David Cameron\u2019s government. George Osborne said in 2013 that Britain was committed to making international tax rules fairer and the rules are due to be finalised this summer and published in October. But US treasury official Robert Stacks has revealed deep frustration with the reality of Britain\u2019s negotiating tactics, accusing the UK of behaving as if it was entitled \u201cto more than the income from the assets, functions and risks actually in their jurisdiction\u201d. It is also claimed that Osborne\u2019s desire to look tougher than Labour on tax avoidance by multinationals before the generalelection had seen the UK \u201cgo it alone\u201d in establishing domestic legislation which undermined on-going international negotiations. The Observer has spoken to a senior official in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, given responsibility by the G20 for organising the talks on global agreements, who confirmed that some of the UK\u2019s moves had been \u201cunhelpful\u201d and that UK diplomats had \u201cpushed back\u201d against initiatives, leading to less progress being made. He said the talks had been an \u201cextremely difficult conversation because there are 44 countries on an equal footing\u201d, although he praised Cameron and Osborne for pioneering stronger rules in some key areas. There would be significant reforms from the negotiations, despite the problems. An agreement was reached in June 2013 at the G8 talks hosted by the UK at Lough Erne, in Northern Ireland, to change international tax rules to prevent multinationals from engaging in cross-border tax avoidance. It was endorsed by the G20 world leaders in the St Petersburg Declaration of September 2013, which commissioned the OECD to develop proposals for these new rules. The final package is due to be presented to the G20 finance ministers on 8 October this year.However Stacks, a Treasury Deputy Assistant Secretary for International Tax Affairs said he had become \u201cdisturbed\u201d by Britain\u2019s decision to establish its own \u2018diverted profit tax\u2019 that would hit multinationals allegedly shielding profits from the UK exchequer with a 25% levy. He said that in establishing such domestic legislation it made it impossible for the global talks to make significant progress in key areas. Talking at an international tax conference, hosted by the OECD thinktank which has been given responsibility for convening talks on a global tax agreement, Stacks further claimed that the UK appeared to have irresponsibly responded to a need to out-manoeuvre Labour on tax avoidance putting \u201ca spotlight on the degree to which political pressure can trump policy\u201d. A senior official within the OECD claimed that Stack\u2019s \u201cshouting\u201d should not detract from some significant progress on country by country reporting on multinationals\u2019 profits, and new guidelines on transfer pricing \u2013 the amount multinationals take out of profits channelled to tax havens for work allegedly carried out there. However the source did confirm that the UK had strenuously resisted changes that would prevent the country from benefiting in full from its low corporation tax agenda. In 2012 the UK government drastically amended its rules on the so-called Controlled Foreign Corporations (CFCs), in order to offer tax advantages for companies to choose to locate their headquarters in the UK. Under such rules profits shifted to lower tax countries are liable to the tax rate in the home country of their parent company, with a credit for foreign taxes paid, reducing any incentive to use low-tax jurisdictions. Three years ago the UK moved to a system which largely exempts foreign profits from UK taxation with the aim of attracting companies to base their parent entity in the UK. One of the objectives of the recent talks has been to achieve multilateral adoption of CFC rules, which could benefit all countries. A senior OECD official suggested that had not been possible, in part, because of the UK\u2019s hardline position. He said: \u201cThere was a lot of push back on the issue of CFC from the UK. \u201cThe UK has a pretty light approach on CFC but that is for countries to decide what they want to do there. We are providing models and best practices so that other countries can move towards them.\u201d He added: \u201cIt is true that the UK government has a very aggressive competition agenda in reducing corporation tax which lowered the CFC legislation \u2026 The UK\u2019s diverted profit tax was also smart politics but it has not been helpful to us [either] because US business community has told the US government not to engage on this with us. That has been unhelpful \u2013 but it is in their prerogative to do that.\u201d",

It shows that we\u2019re unhappy about what\u2019s going to happen, and solidarity in making sure the cuts are reduced.\u201d Only days after her last A-level exam, Fatin Guled was one of a group of young women from Bristol who were leading thousands of protesting students at Saturday\u2019s national anti-austerity demonstration in London. Guled \u2013 with her friend Rosie Simmons, 18, and five other schoolmates \u2013 was asked to head the student bloc at the End Austerity Now demo after the success of a protest they organised in their home city. They are part of a wave of young DIY activists using the internet to engage their peers in political campaigns. Simmons said: \u201cWe saw reports of the protest in London [on 9 May] and we were all on Twitter saying we wished there was a protest in Bristol we could go to. Fatin said, \u2018Well, we could just make one.\u2019 We invited all of our friends on Facebook and it just took off.\u201d About 5,000 people attended the peaceful event in the centre of Bristol on 13 May. Guled said she was astounded by the high turnout: \u201cIt was incredible to see members of our community of all ages and backgrounds.\u201d Three of the seven friends attended Saturday\u2019s demonstration, which was the start of a summer of action. Simmons said: \u201cWe\u2019re protesting against the idea that in order to fund this country we have to take away from the people who are already suffering and struggling the most.\u201d The group has scheduled another demonstration in Bristol on 8 July, the day George Osborne will deliver his new budget. They plan to collect for local food banks and to start supporting women\u2019s shelters. \u201cOur protest has given us quite a big platform in Bristol, particularly because we\u2019re so young,\u201d said Simmons. \u201cWe intend on using that platform to do as much as we can to combat and challenge the cruel effects of austerity.\u201d Young people are the least likely to vote \u2013 only 43% of those aged 18-24 did so in May \u2013 yet grassroots initiatives can have a far-reaching effect on disillusioned youth. Robbie Lee, 16, from Manchester, was dismayed by the lack of formal political education offered by his school and decided to set up his own mock election. The turnout was around 85% \u2013 higher than the actual figure nationwide. \u201cIt was surprising how much interest and engagement there was across school, with people going home and researching [politics],\u201d Lee said. It was the buildup to the Scottish referendum, in which 16- and 17-year-olds were allowed to vote for the first time, that inspired him and his friends to get involved. \u201cThere is potential on a national level for dealing with that supposed apathy,\u201d he said. \u201cAllowing 16- and 17-year-olds to vote in the EU referendum would do a lot of repair to the disillusion.\u201d Abby Tomlinson, 17, had not been involved in any political campaigning before she started the online #Milifandom campaign from her Twitter account. She and a group of like-minded teenagers created humorous graphics to protest at what they saw as unfair media representation of Ed Miliband. \u201cOnline campaigning can be more effective in a way, because it can reach more people,\u201d said Tomlinson, who thinks it is easier for young people to become directly engaged online. She has had \u201cMilifans\u201d as young as 14 showing interest in her campaign, as well as 20-year-olds telling her that it had persuaded them to vote for the first time. \u201cYou need something to grab people\u2019s attention,\u201d she said. \u201cOnce they\u2019re engaged, that\u2019s it for life.\u201d Next year, Tomlinson says, she may be able to use time gained from taking one fewer subjects in the final year of her A-level courses to devote more time to activism. She hopes to use social media to spread the word of future campaigns.",

      "bodyText": "Daniel Roman is feeling upbeat. Six months ago, the 38-year-old sommelier opened a small wine shop in the Mercado de la Cebada, a covered market in Madrid\u2019s trendy La Latina neighbourhood. \u201cI\u2019m confident,\u201d he says, as he serves two elderly customers from the counter. \u201cOpening here was the natural next step for me. I\u2019ve always wanted to build something of my own.\u201d The statistics would indicate he has every reason to feel cheerful. Spain\u2019s economy appears to be emerging at full throttle from one of the longest and deepest recessions it has ever suffered. An IMF report said growth by the end of this year will be a startling 3.1%, leading to job creation, and, in theory at least, a better standard of living for Spaniards who have suffered crippling levels of unemployment and decline over the last seven years. But like many Spaniards, Roman\u2019s optimism does not stem from a faith that Spain\u2019s economic woes are necessarily over. His working day starts at 9am and he gets home after midnight, dividing his time into four shifts between the shop and the restaurant he still works in. \u201cFor me, I\u2019m in a good place. I\u2019m breaking even in the shop and that\u2019s pretty good,\u201d he says. \u201cBut the economy has become a psychological problem. People have been in trouble for so long that they cannot find reasons to be confident. Everyone is told that the economy is improving, but they don\u2019t necessarily believe it.\u201d Crushing losses in recent local elections for prime minister Mariano Rajoy\u2019s governing People\u2019s party (PP), which has hailed the economic recovery in its pitch to voters, suggest that feeling is widespread. A double-dip recession that sent thousands of businesses to the wall, sapped lending and left millions out of work has left scars so deep that for many people in Spain the turnaround is far from complete. While the big picture is undoubtedly improving \u2013 big investors are returning to a country that barely three years ago was widely expected to need a Greece-style sovereign bailout \u2013 Spain is still mired in a period of transition. Even the IMF report that welcomed Spain\u2019s impressive growth rate \u2013 one of the strongest in Europe \u2013 also stressed the shaky jobs outlook, noting that unemployment was \u201cstill painfully high\u201d and that \u201cvulnerabilities remain\u201d. \u201cSpain has returned to about 95% of where it was in 2008,\u201d says Professor Javier Diaz-Gim\u00e9nez of the IESE business school in Madrid. \u201cThat means 2008 is still a benchmark people look back at with nostalgia. At current growth rates, the economy will get back to where it was in 2008 at the end of next year. It\u2019s a very late recovery.\u201d One of the biggest worries for those yet to see any improvements in their lives is whether even a sustained recovery will be enough to repair the damage. Jobs are starting to return, currently at a rate of 400,000-500,000 a year, but more than three million were lost during the downturn, so the new jobs represent only a small improvement in an unemployment rate, which is still runningat almost 24%. In Greece, which now finds itself on the edge of the economic precipice, the rate is 26%. Inequalities, meanwhile, are deepening, leaving some to wonder whether the crisis is even over at all. \u201cThe economy is certainly not improving for those without a job or a home,\u201d says Lotta Tenhunen, a social activist in Vallecas, a less-wealthy district of Madrid. The group she works with, PAH, campaigns on behalf of those evicted after falling into arrears on their mortgage payments, and became especially prominent at the height of the recession. In Vallecas, it still meets every week: \u201cPeople and families are still being driven out of their homes \u2013 and the rate is still rising.\u201d Prospects for the young are particularly bleak. About half of under-25-year-olds in the labour force are without a job, and this threatens to leave the country with a listless lost generation for whom unemployment is the norm. The ranks of the long-term jobless are also swelling. \u201cIt is not just the headline unemployment figure that is worrying; it is also the type of unemployment,\u201d says Antonio Barroso of consultancy Teneo Intelligence. \u201cForty per cent of unemployed people are over the age of 45, so difficult to retrain and bring back into the labour market. You also have to look at the types of jobs being created. Most new positions are temporary contracts, where people are left in a precarious position with very few rights \u2013 this does not breed confidence.\u201d For self-starters such as Roman, government attempts to cut red tape for new businesses have been one encouraging change. Thousands of Spaniards have been setting up on their own, adding to the growing numbers of the self-employed as they pin their hopes on a recovery in consumption. Near Roman\u2019s shop, gourmet bakeries and swanky bars are popping up, just beginning to replace the boarded-up outlets that plagued the neighbourhood in the downturn. Finding the means to get going as an entrepreneur is still a challenge, however, in an era of constrained bank lending. For those unable to start a business, it is still not clear where a major job recovery touted by the centre-right PP is going to come from. A tourism boom is helping as retailers and hotels take on seasonal staff, and some industrial sectors, including car manufacturing, are on the up. But going back to the growth model of the past is not an option. Spain\u2019s economy \u2013 built for years on cheap debt and a housebuilding bubble \u2013 imploded amid the credit crisis of 2008. Its banks, to that point happy to lend to all comers, later required a \u20ac40bn bailout from Brussels. Several favourable tailwinds are now helping a turnaround: the weak euro has helped exporters find new foreign markets to compensate for a lack of domestic interest; a weak oil price is keeping business costs down; and pan-eurozone policies designed to reflate the economy, such as the ECB\u2019s quantitative easing programme, have helped to stimulate demand. War in the Middle East helps the holiday industry, but the benefits are not trickling down fast enough to ordinary Spaniards. Small business owners treat any suggestion that the crisis is over with scepticism. \u201cLooking back, 2006 and 2007 seem like a mirage in the desert,\u201d says Victoria Bazaga, who runs Hotel la Encarnaci\u00f3n, a picturesque bed-and-breakfast near the Unesco-recognised town of C\u00e1ceres in the western Extremadura region. \u201cThings now are almost the same as they have been for the past few years, only now we\u2019re accustomed to a new reality. It\u2019s as if I went to live in London and spent the first few months complaining about the weather. Six years on and we have adapted to it.\u201d Even the beleaguered property market is showing signs of life, though experts say a lot of the demand is coming from overseas, as the weaker euro attracts buyers from northern Europe looking for homes in tourist resorts. \u201cThe international market is doing very well indeed, but the local market is very different. There is no domestic demand at all,\u201d says Marc Pritchard, Majorca-based sales and marketing director of Taylor Wimpey Espa\u00f1a, which builds homes in popular coastal areas. Banks are not giving mortgages to many Spanish customers, he adds, and smaller property developers are struggling to get funding after so many went bankrupt during the crisis. Others in Spain\u2019s property sector report similar trends. Martin Dell, who runs a property listing website, kyero.com, says interest from locals has collapsed: \u201cThe facts speak for themselves. In December 2007, 26% of all our inquiries came from Spanish speakers. That figure is now just 2%.\u201d The lagging recovery for many Spaniards spells trouble for the PP: a general election is due by the end of the year. Recent corruption scandals were another factor in its poor showing in the local elections. This has opened the way for new parties, such as Podemos on the left and the liberal-minded Ciudadanos. Like the Conservatives in Britain, the PP, which has been in office since the end of 2011, sticks to its message on the economy: we know it has been bad, they say, but the medicine is working and things are getting better. It argues it has held off an even worse crisis as it tries to reduce the deficit, calm investors and lower Spain\u2019s borrowing costs. Reforms, including changes to employment law to make it easier for firms to hire and fire staff, have given firms much-needed flexibility, it argues. But it will need to do more to convince many voters. \u201cSpaniards know there is a disconnect between the macro picture and what they are feeling. Usually when things are going well, people feel better. The [current] 3% [growth] is barely the start of what is needed to make up what has been lost,\u201d says Angel Talavera of consultancy Oxford Economics. Many in Spain are already resigned to the idea the boom years will never return. For individuals and businesses, the struggle looks set to continue whatever the outcome of the vote this year. Daniel Roman\u2019s new venture may well take off, and his personal situation may improve as he works all the hours available to him. But save for his shop, and a handful of grocers, butchers and fishmongers, the Mercado de la Cebada is still all but shuttered. If it is an example of an improving Spanish economy, it still has a long way to go. Fragile revival in hardest-hit countries As Greece fights for survival, four European countries have fared better over the past six years. Iceland The island became an emblem of the 2008 crisis when the failure of its bloated banking system forced it to introduce capital controls. Its three largest banks collapsed in October 2008, having amassed loans worth 10 times more than the country\u2019s annual economic output. It became the first rich nation in three decades to take a bailout from the IMF. The economy is now growing again, boosted by tourism and fisheries. This month, parliament approved measures to unwind capital controls and hopes ending the restrictions will draw a line under the financial crisis. Ireland Like Iceland, Ireland\u2019s economy was brought down by an outsize banking sector and it too was forced to seek help from the IMF. But unlike in Iceland, where there was large-scale debt forgiveness, consumers and the government were left with big piles of debt. Households saw the money tied up in their homes dwindle as property prices halved; workers had to swallow pay cuts and austerity measures introduced under Ireland\u2019s EU/IMF bailout. But Ireland exited its bailout programme in 2013 and last year enjoyed the fastest growth in the EU. Portugal Portugal was bailed out by the EU and IMF with \u20ac78bn (\u00a356bn) in 2011. It made a successful return to the bond markets in 2014 \u2013 the first auction of government debt for three years \u2013 and left the rescue programme shortly after. Now its economy is growing again and Portugal has started repaying its bailout. But with its debt-to-GDP ratio still high at more than 120%, there are fears that a disorderly Grexit could lead to contagion and send yields on its government bonds soaring. Cyprus Cyprus\u2019s near-collapse in 2013 forced it to go to the EU, the ECB and IMF for \u20ac10bn in emergency aid. In return, the government was forced to shut down the country\u2019s second-biggest lender and \u201cbail in\u201d banks that, through overexposure to debt-stricken Greece, had caused the meltdown. Capital controls were imposed and savers with more than \u20ac100,000 suffered massive losses. Two years on, Cyprus is recovering. But rating agency Fitch recently highlighted it as one of the most vulnerable countries to Grexit. Katie Allen",

      "body": "<p>Daniel Roman is feeling upbeat. Six months ago, the 38-year-old sommelier opened a small wine shop in the Mercado de la Cebada, a covered market in Madrid\u2019s trendy La Latina neighbourhood. \u201cI\u2019m confident,\u201d he says, as he serves two elderly customers from the counter. \u201cOpening here was the natural next step for me. I\u2019ve always wanted to build something of my own.\u201d</p> <p>The statistics would indicate he has every reason to feel cheerful. Spain\u2019s economy appears to be emerging at full throttle from one of the longest and deepest recessions it has ever suffered. An IMF report said growth by the end of this year will be a startling 3.1%, leading to job creation, and, in theory at least, a better standard of living for Spaniards who have suffered crippling levels of unemployment and decline over the last seven years.</p> <p>But like many Spaniards, Roman\u2019s optimism does not stem from a faith that Spain\u2019s economic woes are necessarily over. His working day starts at 9am and he gets home after midnight, dividing his time into four shifts between the shop and the restaurant he still works in.</p> <p>\u201cFor me, I\u2019m in a good place. I\u2019m breaking even in the shop and that\u2019s pretty good,\u201d he says. \u201cBut the economy has become a psychological problem. People have been in trouble for so long that they cannot find reasons to be confident. Everyone is told that the economy is improving, but they don\u2019t necessarily believe it.\u201d</p> <p>Crushing losses in recent local elections for prime minister Mariano Rajoy\u2019s governing People\u2019s party (PP), which has hailed the economic recovery in its pitch to voters, suggest that feeling is widespread. A double-dip recession that sent thousands of businesses to the wall, sapped lending and left millions out of work has left scars so deep that for many people in Spain the turnaround is far from complete.</p> <p>While the big picture is undoubtedly improving \u2013 big investors are returning to a country that barely three years ago was widely expected to need a Greece-style sovereign bailout \u2013 Spain is still mired in a period of transition.</p> <p>Even the IMF report that welcomed Spain\u2019s impressive growth rate \u2013 one of the strongest in Europe \u2013 also stressed the shaky jobs outlook, noting that unemployment was \u201cstill painfully high\u201d and that \u201cvulnerabilities remain\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cSpain has returned to about 95% of where it was in 2008,\u201d says Professor Javier Diaz-Gim\u00e9nez of the IESE business school in Madrid. \u201cThat means 2008 is still a benchmark people look back at with nostalgia. At current growth rates, the economy will get back to where it was in 2008 at the end of next year. It\u2019s a very late recovery.\u201d</p> <p>One of the biggest worries for those yet to see any improvements in their lives is whether even a sustained recovery will be enough to repair the damage. Jobs are starting to return, currently at a rate of 400,000-500,000 a year, but more than three million were lost during the downturn, so the new jobs represent only a small improvement in an unemployment rate, which is still runningat almost 24%. In Greece, which now finds itself on the edge of the economic precipice, the rate is 26%. Inequalities, meanwhile, are deepening, leaving some to wonder whether the crisis is even over at all.</p> <p>\u201cThe economy is certainly not improving for those without a job or a home,\u201d says Lotta Tenhunen, a social activist in Vallecas, a less-wealthy district of Madrid. The group she works with, PAH, campaigns on behalf of those evicted after falling into arrears on their mortgage payments, and became especially prominent at the height of the recession. In Vallecas, it still meets every week: \u201cPeople and families are still being driven out of their homes \u2013 and the rate is still rising.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f36c660c46b29df99f485dd15066c05498849302\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/20/1434800390676/80dfe28e-b5e1-4cf6-a2b4-37ed29e4f7ac-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Daniel Roman his wine shop in the Mercado de la Cebada.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Daniel Roman in his wine shop in the Mercado de la Cebada. \u2018I\u2019m breaking even and that\u2019s pretty good.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alistair Dawber</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Prospects for the young are particularly bleak. About half of under-25-year-olds in the labour force are without a job, and this threatens to leave the country with a listless lost generation for whom unemployment is the norm.
