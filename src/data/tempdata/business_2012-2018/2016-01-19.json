      "bodyText": "More than 3 million people will become unemployed worldwide in the next two years, making existing jobs vulnerable and fuelling potential social unrest as the global economy slows, a report warns. The International Labour Organization predicts unemployment will rise by about 2.3 million this year to 199.4 million, and that 1.1 million will be added to the global count in 2017, taking joblessness to more than 200 million for the first time on record. The ILO, a UN agency focused on labour standards and social protection, said the effects of last year\u2019s economic slowdown would play out in higher unemployment in 2016, particularly in Asia, Africa, Latin America and the Middle East. Developing markets in those areas will bear the brunt of increased joblessness after the prices of oil and other commodities tumbled in response to slowing growth, the ILO said in its World Employment and Social Outlook report for 2016. The ILO released the forecasts as the global financial elite gathered in the Swiss ski resort of Davos for the World Economic Forum\u2019s annual meeting. The event takes place as oil prices hover near 13-year lows below $30 a barrel, share prices tumble and analysts try to determine the impact of China\u2019s slowing economy. Raymond Torres, one of the report\u2019s authors, said market turmoil at the start of 2016 meant his already gloomy predictions could prove overoptimistic. The International Monetary Fund cut its global growth forecast on Tuesday. \u201cThere are risks and they are mainly on the downside,\u201d Torres said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know the exact dimensions of the slowdown in China. The labour market impact is one of the unknowns because we are going into uncharted territory.\u201d The ILO said oil producers such as Brazil, Nigeria and Russia could suffer social instability as unemployment rose. Brazil has experienced bouts of protest and social disorder in response to spending cuts, tax rises and joblessness. Torres said: \u201cIn these countries, there are shrinking budgets for social protection, food subsidies and so on. When measures like this are taken, it can fuel social tensions.\u201d Unemployment fell last year in developed economies, but the global total of 197.1 million remained 27 million higher than in 2007, before the financial crisis. Torres said the expected rise in unemployment to 200 million was coupled with increasing insecurity, as solid jobs are replaced by unstable work in developing and developed countries. \u201cIt\u2019s not just unemployment \u2013 underemployment is going in the same direction. There are lower participation rates in India but also in the US, where people have dropped out of the labour market, and also in the UK, where for some groups there is low participation.\u201d The ILO research showsthe UK is one of the stronger countries for employment. Britain\u2019s unemployment rate of 5.2% in October 2015 was the lowest since January 2006. The number of young people not in education, unemployment or training was at an eight-year low and prospects look positive for job creation, it concludes. But Torres said poor quality, unstable jobs remained a problem for the UK and that welfare changes needed to maintain support for people struggling to find work. Low-paid, insecure jobs weaken the economy by reducing the living standards of those most likely to spend money, he said. Guy Ryder, the ILO director general, said: \u201cMany working women and men are having to accept low-paid jobs, both in emerging and developing economies, and also increasingly in developed countries. Despite a drop in the number of unemployed in some EU countries and the US, too many people are still jobless. We need to take urgent action to boost the number of decent work opportunities or we risk intensified social tensions.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Prepare for volatility, says Unilever\u2019s chief executive, Paul Polman. If you\u2019re running a global consumer goods company, this seems a sensible basis on which to plan. The price of oil and other commodities is slippery. Some of the emerging markets where Unilever is big are sliding, as are their currencies. Last year\u2019s backdrop of \u201cintensifying geopolitical instability\u201d, as Polman puts it, remains in place. Investors, on the other hand, will be struck by the lack of volatility in Unilever\u2019s business, taken as a whole. Sales growth last year, measured at the underlying level, was 4.1%, which was within a percentage point of the average over the past decade. Price increases accounted for slightly less than half that increase, suggesting brands such as Dove and Magnum retain clout with consumers. Core earnings per share improved 11% at constant currencies, completing half a decade of steady improvements. Ask Polman how it\u2019s done and you tend to get a flow of management babble about \u201cstrengthening our innovation funnel\u201d, which seems to mean novelties such as Hellmann\u2019s mayonnaise in squeezy packs. That doesn\u2019t sound radically different from how food-to-detergent companies have always fiddled with their best sellers. The bigger difference with Polman\u2019s Unilever, perhaps, is that it is keeps costs on a tighter rein than in the old bureaucratic days. Then again, the entire consumer goods industry has upped its game. Whatever the explanation, Polman\u2019s boast that Unilever is a more resilient business seems justified. In the past three full-year figures, he has warned of tough markets, tougher markets and now volatile markets but, through it all, the Unilever ship has battled on. One of these days, a proper storm will develop. But you can also understand why, in an uncertain world, investors are willing to pay a lofty-looking 21 times earnings to own a slice of Unilever, yielding 3%, and why the shares have avoided the new year upset in stock markets. If you have to own something for the long-term, there are many worse places to hide. Bank\u2019s position on rates entirely logical Forecasting is hard, just ask Mark Carney. Back in 2014, the Bank of England governor warned that financial markets had underestimated the chances of interest rate rises. In July he told us the decision on when to raise rates would come into sharper relief at the turn of the year. And now? With the Bank rate stuck at 0.5%, Carney is declining to offer more hints on timing that could be considered a hostage to fortune. A \u201cpowerful set of forces\u201d prevented policymakers from raising rates, he said in a speech that sent sterling into a spin on Tuesday. \u201cMonetary policy will continue to depend on economic prospects not the calendar,\u201d he added, presumably regretting his previous turn-of-the-year reference. In truth, Carney\u2019s latest position is entirely logical. Core inflation is low, the oil price has been tumbling, wage pressure is weak and the UK economy overall is not gaining momentum. But the latest iteration of the governor\u2019s thinking raises the question of why he previously felt the need to get everybody so excited about the possibility of imminent rate rises. It\u2019s always good to know what the governor is pondering, of course. And, yes, we all understand that events happen \u2013 and that the low oil price and China\u2019s removal of the yuan from a firm peg to the dollar are very big financial events. But, piece by piece, Carney\u2019s much-hyped era of \u201cforward guidance\u201d appears to have dissolved. We\u2019re back to waiting and seeing, and watching the incoming data \u2013 just like the old days, in fact. The UK\u2019s nuclear white elephant? Hinkley Point \u201cis a big opportunity for UK steel,\u201d says EDF, the French constructor of the new nuclear plant in Somerset, before giving the small print. The UK doesn\u2019t have the capability to produce the very largest forgings, which will be sourced from elsewhere. As the rest of the requirement, EDF\u2019s \u201cexpectation\u201d is that a large proportion will come from the UK but this is subject to a competitive process, it says. The bottom line, then, is that EDF is not mandated to use any UK steel at Hinkley Point. The position is a national disgrace, says lobby group UK Steel. One can sympathise with steelmakers. At the current oil price, Hinkley Point is set to become the biggest white elephant to be built in the UK for decades \u2013 we could at least build it with some British steel. The get-out clause about competitive tendering is feeble when you remember that the UK government is simultaneously granting expensive 35-year guarantees (paid by consumers, naturally) on Hinkley Point\u2019s output of electricity. If value for money was the goal, the plant would not have been commissioned in the first place.",

GW Davos isn\u2019t just about greedy bankers and scheming politicians. Tonight, the press pack are hearing from Mark Pollock, who became the first blind man to reach the South Pole in 2009. The next year, he fell from a second floor window, broke his back, and is paralysed. He\u2019s currently explaining how he\u2019s been working with pioneering doctors who are working on spinal cord injuries and seeking a cure for paralysis. Impossible? Not if you listen to Pollock, whose resolve and optimism is quite, quite gripping. He believes a cure is possible, saying: The next big step for mankind is to take the first step after paralysis. And he\u2019s shown us videos of how he has worked with scientists to get his own body working again (we just saw him bend his left leg, thanks to an array of wiring). Pollock\u2019s message is that, in the 4th industrial revolution, biotechnology and genetic engineering could help a new wave of pioneers to redefine what it means to be human (I\u2019m paraphrasing him). Google him, please, and find out more about what he\u2019s doing. It sounds pretty important. An intriguing theme has emerged around this year\u2019s Davos - the Falklands Islands. Argentina\u2019s new president, Mauricio Macri, has declared that he wants to rebuild his country\u2019s relationship with the UK, more than thirty years after the Falklands War. Macri is going to meet with David Cameron at Davos; we\u2019ll be poised for that. The awards ceremony is over, and delegates are fanning out across the Congress Centre, and beyond, ready for tomorrow\u2019s action. DiCaprio announces that his foundation is making a new \u00a315m donation to help protect fragile ecosystems. This includes rainforests in Sumatro, and protecting other rainforsts from the palm oil industry. And finally, Leonardo DiCaprio is picking up a Crystal Award for his work on environmental issues and climate change. The Hollywood actor tells delegates at Davos thatworld leaders took an important first step in Paris with their agreement to reduce carbon emissions. But there\u2019s much more to do. The Paris agreement was a call to action, but it falls to all of us to help fight against the \u201cirreversible damage\u201d that climate change will cause. We simply cannot afford the greed of the oil industry to determine the future of humanity. Enough is enough, you know better, the world knows better. History will put the blame for this devastation firmly at their feet. And DiCaprio insists that fossil fuel reserves must be left where they are. Climate change cannot be stopped unless fossil fuels are left in the ground. The next Crystal award goes to Chinese actor Yao Chen. She\u2019s known as the Queen of Weibo, with 78 million followers on the social media site (there\u2019s an audible gasp in the audience). Chen is being recognised for her work raising awareness of the refugee crisis, visiting migrant communities in countries such as Philippines, Thailand, Ethiopia, Lebanon and Pakistan. Chen thanks aid organisations, the UN, and her husband for his support, and talks about how helping other people is important; it helps to meet the needs of the helper too. America\u2019s poorest communities could be changed forever if they could spawn the next technology giant, will.i.am continues. That\u2019s the long-term goal of his foundation. Hilde Schwab, who co-founded WEF with her husband Klaus, has the floor in Davos. She\u2019s announcing the winners of the Crystal Awards - WEF\u2019s annual prizes for people who have gone the extra mile to make the world better (no, they don\u2019t give them to Wall Street bankers) This year\u2019s winners are actors Yao Chen and Leonardo DiCaprio, artist Olafur Eliasson, and musician and entrepreneur will.i.am. Hilde explains that Eliasson has helped create and strengthen communities by building large-scale installations and designs. Next comes Will.i.am (of the Black Eyed Peas, younger readers) is being recognised for his work bringing educational opportunist to the underpriviliged. His I am Angel foundation has helped keep young people in education and out of Will.i.am is now on stage, joking that he grew up near gangs in the ghettos of America but he was more scared of his mother than the gangs so he kept out. But turning serious, he says he wants kids to aspire to be the next Steve Jobs, the next Bill Gates, and fix the world\u2019s problems rather than waiting for governments to do it for them. One of Davos\u2019s many curious traditions is a habit of ringing cowbells when a keynote session is about to start. And that ding-ding noise in the distance means the opening ceremony is getting underway. Back at the cancer moonshot talk, Joe Biden has called on the public to do their bit to help tackle the illness. It won\u2019t be easy, or cheap. As well as warning about the impact of automation, Axel Weber, chairman of UBS, is discussing today\u2019s latest downgrade of global growth forecasts by the IMF. It was like groundhog day, he say, as the IMF had downgraded its forecasts nine times. \u201cIt\u2019s a sign we have moved to a lower growth economy.\u201d Weber adds that the problem isn\u2019t so much cyclical as structural. The low growth, low inflation and low interest environment was likely to remain, he said. UBS chairman Axel Weber says politicians need to address the rising inequality that the robot revolution will cause: Jill is tweeting the details: While Biden was demanding more progress on cancer, Swiss bank UBS has been presenting a new report into the fourth industrial revolution. And you may be unsurprised to hear that UBS reckons the richest will benefit most from new technologies such as robots, AI, 3D printing, and all those cutting-edge systems. Why? Because firms will be able to use robots to squeeze out low-paid workers, boosting their profit margins at the expense of the poorest. Here\u2019s the story, by Jill Treanor: Joe Biden is now challenging the experts on the panel, who includes top cancer researchers from the US and beyond, to share their data better. Big data, he insists, is the key to this moonshot. What would happen if I asked all of you who have data..... to get together in one room. Could that make sense, to talk to each other?... No-one dares to object. Well, in that case I\u2019m going to do it, Biden grins. Not for the cameras, but for my own knowledge, and to make faster progress. Some reaction to Joe Biden\u2019s words: Here\u2019s another photo from the cancer moonshot talk: Data is absolutely crucial to Joe Biden\u2019s cancer moonshot: When Joe Biden talks about a cancer moonshot, he is harking back to the Apollo landings, and John F Kennedy\u2019s declaration that America would put a man on the moon before the end of the 1960s. This battle is different, though, partly because Biden doesn\u2019t think the Federal government can do all the work. Part of our role is to get out of the way, so the real experts can make the progress we need, the vice-president tells his audience at Davos. But we will also do everything we can at the federal level to help. Cancer has touched nearly all of us in some way, Joe Biden points out - few families have avoided experiencing it. And every year, 14 billion people are diagnosed with cancer, 8 million die from it. That total, of course, includes Beau Biden, the vice-president\u2019s son who died of brain cancer last year. Hello from Davos, where this year\u2019s World Economic Forum is getting underway. Not without a few hitches, though. It\u2019s bumper-to-bumper traffic out there, as business leaders, politicians, policy advocates and the media make the annual trek to WEF. And even the vice-president of the United States, Joe Biden, got caught in the jam; it made him around 30 minutes late for a meeting with top scientists to push for a \u2018moonshot\u2019 to find a cure for cancer. The vice-president apologises profusely and charmingly - but he doesn\u2019t need to; everyone here knows how Davos is a logistical nightmare this time of year. And his mission is so important that it\u2019s well worth waiting a few minutes.....\uf70f And then it\u2019s down to business, with Biden explaining why he believes the world can make huge progress in the next few years. President Obama and I don\u2019t want small change, he insists - we want a Quantum Leap. Biden says: We are at an inflection point - a lot has been achieved in the last decade or less. We have seen amazing advances in science, immunology. Genomics is being leveraged in ways that weren\u2019t possible even six years ago. VP Biden adds that it\u2019s vital to ensure that researchers have access to all the data available, as every cancer centre keeps a record of its own data. Tapping this treasure trove is vital to speeding the process towards finding a cure for cancer. The session is being streamed here. On a busy day and ahead of the start of the Davos conference, here\u2019s a quick recap of events: Chinese GDP shows a slowdown.... ...but markets move higher on hopes for further central bank stimulus UK inflation hits an 11 month high ... but Bank of England governor Mark Carney rules out early rate rise ....which sends the pound sharply lower Meanwhile the IMF cuts its global growth forecasts The oil market could drown in oversupply says the International Energy Agency On that note, we\u2019ll close for the moment. But Graeme Wearden will be back later with the first reports from this year\u2019s Davos gathering. US markets have followed the example of Europe, and are moving sharply higher in early trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 148 points or 0.9% higher, while the S&amp;P 500 has climbed around 1%. Chinese GDP figures prompted talk of further stimulus measures to support the world\u2019s second largest economy, while positive results from Bank of America and Morgan Stanley added to the upbeat mood. Here\u2019s a horrifying thought. There could be more plastic in the sea than fish in just over three decades. Ahead of Davos, Graeme Wearden reports: As a record-breaking yachtswoman, Dame Ellen MacArthur has seen more of the world\u2019s oceans than almost anyone else. Now she is warning that there will be more waste plastic in the sea than fish by 2050, unless the plastics industry cleans up its act. According to a new report issued by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation at the World Economic Forum on Tuesday, new plastics will consume 20% of all oil production within 35 years, up from an estimated 5% today. Plastics production has increased by twentytimes since 1964, reaching 311m tonnes in 2014, the equivalent of more than 900 Empire State Buildings, the report says, and it is expected to double again in the next 20 years, and almost quadruple by 2050. Despite this growing demand, just 5% of plastic goods are actually recycled effectively, while 40% end up in landfill and a third leak into fragile ecosystems such as the world\u2019s oceans. The full story is here: Mark Carney\u2019s caution on interest rates is justified, says our economics editor Larry Elliott: Mark Carney is half way through his five-year term as governor of the Bank of England. Judging by his latest remarks on the state of the economy he could go back to Canada in the summer of 2018 and still not have raised interest rates. The governor\u2019s speech was notable for its dovish tone. Six months ago, in a speech in Lincoln, he said the decision on whether to increase the cost of borrowing would come into sharper relief around the turn of the year. That was seen as an indication that a tightening of policy would be announced sooner rather than later. Well, the turn of the year has arrived, Carney has decided that the time is not yet ripe for a rate rise. Marching the markets up to the top of the interest rate hill only to march them down again has become a bit of a habit. For all that, the governor\u2019s caution is justified. Carney said a \u201cpowerful set of forces\u201d - some domestic, some global, some long-lasting, some cyclical - had combined to keep interest rates at their record low rates since the Great Recession ended in 2009. Read the full analysis here: On the pound\u2019s decline today, David Lamb, head of dealing at the forex group Fexco, said: The prospect of a UK interest rate rise hasn\u2019t been kicked into the long grass. The Governor hoofed it right out of the park. Mark Carney\u2019s prediction - made last summer - that we would have greater clarity on interest rates at the start of 2016 has been completely overtaken by events. Six months on, the prospects for UK interest rates remain as clear as mud. Even though UK inflation crept up a notch to a paltry 0.2% in December, tumbling oil prices will continue to drag down prices. Against a backdrop of extreme Chinese volatility and slipping rates of both growth and wages in the UK, none of the stars are aligned for a rate rise any time soon. With a UK rate hike now receding into the distance once again, monetary policy in London and Washington will continue to move in opposite directions. As a result the pound has tumbled against the dollar, and it is even slumping against the euro too. The combination of skittish equity markets and the vanishing prospect of a rate hike means investor appetite for sterling is eroding - and as a result the pound\u2019s gradual slide is likely to continue. And the pound is still falling: Answering questions, Carney said the Bank was picking up uncertainty around political events, but investment intentions remained robust. He also indicated that rates could rise before the consumer price index hit 2%: Spot in this chart of today\u2019s movement of the pound against the dollar when Carney started speaking and suggesting now is not the time to raise rates: The governor of the Bank of England has warned that the UK faces \u201ca powerful set of forces\u201d preventing policymakers from raising interest rates and the date of the first rise is still uncertain, writes Phillip Inman. Mark Carney said the plunge in oil prices had dragged down inflation and postponed the date of a rise from the current 0.5%, though he refused to indicate when the central bank would make its first move. Carney said: \u201cMonetary policy will continue to depend on economic prospects and not the calender.\u201d But his gloomy outlook, which also highlighted the rapid slowdown in China and the recent turmoil in global markets, is likely to be seen as delaying the first increase in rates since 2008 until at least the end of this year or possibly 2017. This will force many of the City\u2019s investment banks to tear up their own forecasts, which have pencilled in a rise in the summer or Autumn. Bank of England governor Mark Carney wants to see faster growth and stronger inflation before raising interest rates, with no set timetable for an increase. In a speech at the Queen Mary University of London, he said global and domestic growth had proved weaker than he expected in the middle of last year, when he predicted a decision on rates would come into sharper relief by early 2016. He said: Well the year has turned, and, in my view, the decision proved straightforward: now is not yet the time to raise interest rates. This wasn\u2019t a surprise to market participants or the wider public. They observed the renewed collapse in oil prices, the volatility in China, and the moderation in growth and wages here at home since the summer and rightly concluded that not enough cumulative progress had been made to warrant tightening monetary policy. You can follow his speech live here. And now oil is back over $30 a barrel, despite the International Energy Agency warning of continuing oversupply. Brent crude has jumped 5.7% to $30.18, helped by strong oil demand from China. There is also the hope of more stimulus from the Chinese authorities following the latest GDP figures, which showed a slowdown in growth. Stock markets continue to move higher following the Chinese GDP data, and despite higher than expected UK inflation and the IMF cutting its global growth forecasts. The FTSE 100 is currently up nearly 1.9%, while Germany\u2019s Dax is 2% higher and France\u2019s Cac has climbed 2.3%. In the US the futures are showing a 250 rise on the Dow Jones Industrial Average. As a reminder the US markets were closed on Monday, and fell sharply in the previous session on the tumbling oil price. Crude is now up 4.7% at $29.9 a barrel. And here are the IMF comments on markets and China, courtesy of Reuters: Global financial markets seem to be overreacting to falling oil prices and China, the chief economist of the International Monetary Fund said on Tuesday. Maurice Obstfeld also said it was critical that China is clear about its overall policy strategy, including its currency. \u201cIt\u2019s not a stretch to suggest that (markets) may be reacting very strongly to rather small bits of evidence in an environment of volatility and risk aversion,\u201d Obstfeld said in a news conference held after the IMF cut its global growth forecasts for the third time in less than a year. The IMF has commented on the prospect of Britain leaving the EU: Here\u2019s the UK Treasury welcoming the day\u2019s inflation figures: The IMF is giving more details of its global outlook. Its chief economist Maurice Obstfeld said there were clearly deflationary pressures in the eurozone, and he expected the European Central Bank to ease further as further data comes in. He added that the US recovery appeared to be weaker than the Federal Reserve was expected when it raised interest rates in December. And he played down the recent market turmoil: He said the IMF did not see some of the extreme negative scenarios that the markets seemed to be anticipating. He added that a falling oil price would help consumers, so it was not an unmitigated negative. UK house prices are at a 10 month high, according to the Office for National Statistics: Meanwhile the ZEW confidence index showed a downbeat mood among German analysts and investors in the wake of the recent market turmoil. With any slowdown in China likely to knock the German export market, the ZEW think tank said economic sentiment fell from 16.1 in December to 10.2 in January. But this was higher than a Reuters estimate of 8.2. In the eurozone, inflation has come in at 0.2% year on year in December, in line with expectations. The month on month figure was flat. November\u2019s year on year figure was revised down from 0.2% to 0.1%. That is a long was short of the European Central Bank\u2019s 2% target despite the stimulus package the central bank has instituted. Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, said: Today\u2019s inflation figures suggest that ECB President Mario Draghi\u2019s renewed stimulus plan isn\u2019t yet having the desired effect, and the two per cent target is still a long way off. Record low oil prices, alongside volatility in China and elsewhere, have taken their toll on major economies the world over and the Eurozone is no different. With a stimulus programme in effect and no real room to manoeuvre interest rates further, Draghi is running out of options. Draghi must hope that any extra cash in the pockets of consumers due to low oil prices goes straight back into the economy to spur growth. Back with UK inflation, and Howard Archer at IHS Global Insight expects a UK rate rise in August: With consumer price inflation still only 0.2% in December, there is certainly little immediate pressure on the Bank of England to start raising interest rates. We believe it is pretty unlikely that the Bank of England will raise interest rates (from 0.50% to 0.75%) until at least August \u2013 given the increased probability that inflation will stay lower for longer and a current more uncertain growth outlook. Indeed, there is a very real chance that the Bank of England could delay raising interest rates until the fourth quarter of 2016. Our current belief that the Bank of England will most likely edge interest rates up from 0.50% to 0.75% in August is based on the assumption that economic growth will be reasonable over the first half of 2016, earnings growth sees some renewed pick-up amid a tightening labour market and consumer price inflation trends gradually up. Even if the Bank of England does delay interest rates beyond August, we doubt it will delay acting until 2017 - barring a major slowdown in UK growth. The International Monetary Fund has reduced its growth forecasts in its latest update on the global economy. Our economics editor Larry Elliott reports: [The IMF] has added to concerns about the health of the global economy by cutting its growth forecasts for the next two years and warning that recovery from the financial crisis could be derailed altogether if key challenges are mishandled. The Washington-based body said world output would be 0.2 points lower in 2016 and 2017 compared with forecasts made just three months ago \u2013 and that the risks to its predictions were to the downside. In an update to its World Economic Outlook, the IMF said growth was put at 3.4% this year and 3.6% in 2017. It said central banks should continue to boost growth and that finance ministries should bolster investment spending where possible. It also warned that a \u201ctide of refugees\u201d was putting the EU under strain and that action was needed to ensure that migrants could find jobs. Full story here: The inflation figures, along higher than expected, should not put pressure on the Bank of England to raise rates, said James Knightley at ING Bank: December UK headline consumer price inflation has come in at 0.2% year on year, up from 0.1% in November and is the fastest rate of price increase since January 2015. Meanwhile the core rate of inflation (excluding food and fuel) rose 1.4% year on year versus a consensus forecast of 1.2%. This was also the highest inflation rate since January last year. The details show air fares contributed positively (up 26.8% year on year! Sea fares were up 20.3%) \u2013 note that the transportation component was the only one of 12 CPI sub components to actually increase. It showed transport prices swinging from -2.1% year on year to -0.2%. However, food prices saw intensifying deflation, as did clothing, furniture, recreation and culture. Therefore, today\u2019s pick-up in inflation (particularly core) can\u2019t really be viewed as suggesting the story regarding inflation has changed much. After all, transportation prices will fall back again next month given what has happened to fuel costs. Given that inflation remains so soft and with tomorrow\u2019s UK labour report set to show a further slowing in the pace of wage growth, the Bank of England is under no pressure to respond. Moreover, the Brexit uncertainty poses clear risks for growth, particularly through the investment and hiring channels, which will more than offset concerns about inflation risks from sterling\u2019s recent falls. As such we see little prospect of BoE action ahead of the EU referendum, which seems set for June/July. We continue to have November as the probable start point for UK rate hikes, assuming the UK votes to remain an EU member state. The pound has moved to its day\u2019s highs against the dollar and euro, as the UK inflation figures came in higher than expected. Sterling touched $1.4340, up from $1.4320 before the data, while against the euro it strengthened from 76p to 75.82p. Our report on inflation, from Patrick Collinson: There was a surprise rise in the UK\u2019s inflation rate to 0.2% in December, the first month since January 2015 in which the rate has exceeded 0.1% according to the Office for National Statistics. Transport costs, particularly air fares, and to a lesser extent motor fuels, were the main contributors to the rise, said the ONS. These were partly offset by downward pressure on prices for alcohol and tobacco along with food and non-alcoholic beverages partially offset the rise. Monthly inflation has been between -0.1% and 0.1% for the past eleven months, helped by plunging commodity prices. More here: And here\u2019s the trend for CPI: Here\u2019s a breakdown of the inflation data: This is also the first time the rate has exceeded 0.1% since January 2015, according to the Office for National Statistics. It said: Movements in transport costs, particularly air fares and to a lesser extent motor fuels, were the main contributors to the rise in the rate. Downward pressures from prices for alcohol and tobacco along with food and non-alcoholic beverages partially offset the rise. The UK consumer price index has risen 0.1% in December on a month on month basis, in line with forecasts. But the year on year figure of 0.2% is the highest since January 2015, and higher than expectations of a 0.1% rise. The crude oil market will continue to be oversupplied until at least late 2016, according to the International Energy Agency. It said the market \u201ccould drown in oversupply.\u201d With unseasonably warm weather and rising supply - not least from Iran now sanctions have been lifted - will continue to put pressure on crude prices. The IEA said global oil demand fell to a one year low of 1m barrels a day in the fourth quarter of 2015, down from 2.1m in the previous three months. In its latest monthly report the IEA left its estimate of global demand growth for 2016 at 1.2m barrels a day. The IEA said (quote courtesy Reuters): We conclude that the oil market faces the prospect of a third successive year when supply will exceed demand by 1m barrels a day and there will be enormous strain o the ability of the oil system to absorb it efficiently. Brent crude, which was earlier up 3%, is now 2.5% higher at $29.29 a barrel. A couple of positive comments on the Chinese GDP figures. Rain Newton-Smith, CBI director of economics, said: These figures paint a picture of a Chinese economy which is slowing and rebalancing, but still making a huge contribution to the global economy. In recent weeks, financial markets have struggled to digest this situation, alongside further weakness in oil prices. While direct links between the UK and China are relatively small, the spill-over effects from China\u2019s economic slowdown, alongside continued volatility in financial markets, amplify the downside risks to growth in the UK. Nevertheless, it\u2019s important not to be too downbeat about China or emerging markets more generally. With household incomes up by 7%, and online retails sales growing by 33% last year, China represents a lucrative market for British business. Meanwhile James Sinclair at corporate finance house Clearwater International said: Much will be made of the fact that this is China\u2019s weakest growth in a quarter of a century: Intense volatility in the stock market and the cycle of industrial overcapacity and sluggish external demand have had policymakers looking over their shoulder for a good while. But we don\u2019t see this as the toppling of an economic giant. Instead, there is a rapidly different business environment forming in China. The overall trend for consumer spending is far from grim, and the surging middle class is at the heart of this consumption boom. While consumers are boosting demand for imported goods, there are Chinese companies working in the opposite direction, and redefining what Chinese exporters look like. With the growth of entrepreneurism and innovation in the country, we can expect to see many other Chinese companies both threaten existing industry structures and open up new spaces. By the end of the decade, we still expect China to be one of the leading cross-border investors, and given the patterns we have seen, this is a trend we see no sign of stopping. More on UK inflation. lya Spivak, currency strategist at DailyFX, said: The core year-on-year inflation rate is expected to register at 1.2% in December, unchanged from the prior month. Leading survey data hints downward price pressures may have waned however, opening the door for an upside surprise. Such an outcome may breathe a big of life into rate hike speculation, offering a lift to the British pound. Follow-on comments from Bank of England governor Mark Carney represent a bit of wild card and may either amplify or undermine the initial post-CPI response, depending on the central bank chief\u2019s tone. Despite Bank of England governor Mark Carney saying in the middle of last year that it should be clearer by now when UK interest rates should be increased, that is not at all the case. Recent weak data and the current market turmoil that many analysts do not expect any move until much later this year, if at all. Bank of England policymaker Gertjan Vlieghe seemed to concur on Monday, saying ultra low rates could be here to stay for some years. So Carney\u2019s speech later at the University of London will be closely watched for any hints as to the timing of any rate rise. Still on the corporate front, one of the day\u2019s biggest gainers in the UK market so far is Ocado. The online grocer is up 11% following a revival of talk that Amazon could be interested in a takeover to boost its own fledgling food business. Unilever, which makes everything from Dove soap to Pot Noodle, is expecting trading condtions to be tougher and more volatile this year. The company beat analysts forecasts with full year sales up 4.1%, despite negligible growth in developmed markets and weakness in emerging markets. Full story here: As the markets hold onto their early gains, analyst Tony Cross at Trustnet Direct said: A shortfall in Chinese GDP data for 2015 \u2013 and accompanying hopes that this will be the catalyst for further stimulus measures from Beijing \u2013 is the key driver here, and it\u2019s the natural resources stocks that are leading the charge. Whilst some upside is probably warranted \u2013 not least given the protracted falls we\u2019ve accrued of late \u2013 the question as always is just how sustainable these gains will prove to be. The news of weak growth has obviously done nothing to lend support to oil prices, but bargain hunting and a mounting belief that Opec\u2019s over supply of the market will now reign in higher cost production is also helping crude edge higher. A break back above $30/barrel here could prove instrumental in cementing a degree of confidence in the wider market. David Morrison at Spreadco said it will be key to see if markets can maintain their earlyi momentum: How this now plays out could be very instructive. If equities can hold on to early gains then we could finally build some upside momentum and reverse last year\u2019s losses. But if this rally fades, as did all the attempts last week, then that could signal that we\u2019re entering a fully blown bear market. Ahead of the latest EU inflation number and the ZEW confidence figures, Germany has reported a 0.2% year on year rise in its consumer price index. Following a move below $28 a barrel on Monday in the wake of Iran\u2019s promise to increase exports now sanctions have been lifted, crude prices have regained some ground. Brent is now up 3% at $29.44 a barrel, following strong oil data from China where demand in 2015 was at a record 10.32m barrels a day, up 2.5% from the previous year. Following on from Asia, European stock markets have moved higher in early trading. The FTSE 100 has jumped 1.7% or 102 points to 5881.92 while Germany\u2019s Dax is up 2.1%, France\u2019s Cac 1.9% and Spain\u2019s Ibex 1.7%. The Chinese data is behind the moves. With the GDP figure was just shy of the government\u2019s targets, investors are betting on more stimulus from the central bank to give the world\u2019s second largest economy a lift. So mining shares are among the leading risers, with Glencore and Anglo American both up around 8%. Ahead of the World Economic Forum\u2019s annual conference which begins this evening, my colleague Graeme Wearden has looked at the eight key themes, ranging from the rise of the robots to market turmoil and medicine: For UK inflation, most analysts expect the CPI figure to come in at 0.1% but RBC Capital Markets goes a little higher: RBC forecasts CPI inflation at 0.3% year on year in December 2015, up from 0.1% year on year in November. However, as last time, we acknowledge that the risk to the forecast is to the downside as the continued decline in the petrol price has reduced the base effects that were due to kick in on the back of oil price declines at the end of 2014. For RPI inflation, we look for the annual rate to hold at 1.1% year on year. Beyond the monthly print, the message remains that even if inflation does get near 1% year on year soon, there are limited prospects in 2016 for it taking another leg up from there and moving towards the 2% target. As well as China\u2019s stock markets moving higher, the Nikkei and Hang Seng are also in positive territory, up 0.5% and 1.75% respectively. So Europe is expected to follow suit: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. On a busy day for economic news, China has kicked things off with news of the slowest GDP growth in 25 years. The figure of 6.9% growth for the year was not far from the government target but prompted talk of new stimulus measures, and gave some support to the Chinese stock market. The CSI300 index rose 2.95% while the Shanghai composite was 3.2% higher. Here is our report on the Chinese GDP numbers: Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: This morning\u2019s latest Chinese economic data hasn\u2019t really shed any new light on an economy that we know is slowing down. The latest fourth quarter GDP data came in at 6.8%, the slowest pace in 25 years and slightly below consensus expectations, while December industrial production slid back to 5.9% from 6.2% in November, no real surprise given recent weak PMI readings. Retail sales were slightly disappointing coming in at 11.1%, slipping back from 11.2% and breaking a sequence of consecutive monthly improvements since last March. While these numbers are slightly disappointing they don\u2019t point to a sharp slowdown, however it does raise the question as to what further steps to stimulate the economy policymakers will take in the coming weeks.

Six months ago, in a speech in Lincoln, he said the decision on whether to increase the cost of borrowing would <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/16/uk-interest-rate-rise-new-year\">come into sharper relief around the turn of the year</a>.

Meanwhile the core rate of inflation (excluding food and fuel) rose 1.4% year on year versus a consensus forecast of 1.2%. This was also the highest inflation rate since January last year.</p> <p>The details show air fares contributed positively (up 26.8% year on year! Sea fares were up 20.3%) \u2013 note that the transportation component was the only one of 12 CPI sub components to actually increase. It showed transport prices swinging from -2.1% year on year to -0.2%. However, food prices saw intensifying deflation, as did clothing, furniture, recreation and culture. Therefore, today\u2019s pick-up in inflation (particularly core) can\u2019t really be viewed as suggesting the story regarding inflation has changed much. After all, transportation prices will fall back again next month given what has happened to fuel costs.<br></p> <p>Given that inflation remains so soft and with tomorrow\u2019s UK labour report set to show a further slowing in the pace of wage growth, the Bank of England is under no pressure to respond. Moreover, the Brexit uncertainty poses clear risks for growth, particularly through the investment and hiring channels, which will more than offset concerns about inflation risks from sterling\u2019s recent falls. As such we see little prospect of BoE action ahead of the EU referendum, which seems set for June/July. We continue to have November as the probable start point for UK rate hikes, assuming the UK votes to remain an EU member state.<br></p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-569e0841e4b03e04102e173d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-01-19T09:57:57.006Z\">9.57am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bbf656ba8ba91f2cfe7b7818b541ca1f2e852f89\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bbf656ba8ba91f2cfe7b7818b541ca1f2e852f89/0_0_746_527/500.jpg\" alt=\"UK inflation contribution\" width=\"500\" height=\"353\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">UK inflation contribution</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Office for National Statistics</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-569e0788e4b06544a9da911f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-01-19T09:55:06.043Z\">9.55am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The pound has moved to its day\u2019s highs against the dollar and euro, as the UK inflation figures came in higher than expected.</p> <p>Sterling touched $1.4340, up from $1.4320 before the data, while against the euro it strengthened from 76p to 75.82p.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-569e06ffe4b0cdd2b1e0ce2f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-01-19T09:53:00.115Z\">9.53am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/FOREXcom/statuses/689380128820838400\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Other measures of UK inflation were also stronger than expected with RPI rising 1.2% vs. 1.0% expected and HPI +7.7% vs. 7.3% y/y <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/FX?src=hash\">#FX</a> ^FR</p>&mdash;

The figure of 6.9% growth for the year was not far from the government target but prompted talk of new stimulus measures, and gave some support to the Chinese stock market.

Retail sales were slightly disappointing coming in at 11.1%, slipping back from 11.2% and breaking a sequence of consecutive monthly improvements since last March.

      "bodyText": "Soaring sales of sparkling wine, beer and gin at bargain prices helped supermarkets to a much happier than expected Christmas, figures show. Total sales of beer, wine and spirits rose 2.2% across the grocery market in the three months to 3 January, according to analysts at Kantar Worldpanel, boosted by an 11% increase in sales of sparkling wines. Sales were driven by bargain prices, with 16 out of the top 20 spirits cheaper than a year earlier, according to Nielsen. The market research group said the grocers had used discounts to pull in shoppers. Sales of gin in the major supermarkets rose by more than \u00a314m to \u00a3121m, making it the fastest growing spirit, followed by cream liqueurs, including Bailey\u2019s Original, which was on offer at Asda and Morrisons, Nielsen said. But the researchers also marked out sparkling wine as the standout category, with nearly 16% more bottles sold as prices fell. In the four weeks up to 19 December, Sainsbury\u2019s said sales of prosecco rose 34%, while Virgin Wines described the drink as its \u201cChristmas champion\u201d. The online specialist sold 51,000 bottles in December, an eight-fold increase on 2012. Matt Harwood, an alcohol analyst at Nielsen, described sparkling wine as a \u201ckey trend\u201d, with sales of champagne bouncing back from a decline in 2014 alongside the continuing popularity of prosecco. \u201cThe grocery multiples increasingly look to use beer, wine and spirit promotions as a footfall driver for the \u2018big Christmas shop\u2019, while prices continue to come down due to price matching versus Aldi and Lidl,\u201d he said. The German discount chains have won over middle-class shoppers by offering cheap deals on alcohol, including champagne, forcing the others to react with their own price cuts. This Christmas, the major supermarkets successfully fought back. Overall sales of alcohol at the leading chains rose 3.2% in December, helping offset falling sales of fresh meat, baked goods and household essentials, according to Nielsen. Morrisons said a revamp of its alcohol department and deals on cases of wine over the Black Friday sales weekend were important contributors to a surprise 0.2% increase in sales at its established stores over Christmas. The Morrisons chief executive, David Potts, said the booze aisle had been the \u201cstandout department\u201d. Sainsbury\u2019s sales of premium own-label wines rose by 18% over the festive season, and total alcohol sales were up slightly, helping it to an unexpectedly good 0.4% fall in sales at its core stores in the three months to 9 January. Specialists also enjoyed strong trading, with Majestic Retail, owner of Majestic Wines and online off licence Naked Wines, reporting a 7.3% rise in underlying sales in the 10 weeks to 7 January. Privately owned Virgin Wines said underlying sales rose 12% in the six weeks to 2 January. Jay Wright, the chief executive of Virgin Wines, described the Christmas period as \u201cexceptional\u201d. The Christmas booze rush came ahead of new government health guidance on alcohol released earlier this month, which advises that there is no safe limit and even drinking small amounts can cause illnesses including cancer. Since then, pub landlords have complained that the dry January trend has hit their businesses. Pubs also enjoyed a boost over the festive season. Drink-led pub and bar businesses were the best performers monitored by the Coffer Peach business tracker. It said pubs and bars collectively enjoyed 3.1% sales growth at established outlets in the six weeks to 3 January. Most of that came through in the last two weeks, when many people took time off for a festive holiday. Unseasonably warm weather in many parts of the country encouraged people to head out to the pub, if not to the high street, where visitor numbers were down. Adam Spencer, an associate director at business advisory firm RSM UK, said: \u201cThe wettest December in more than a century failed to dampen [the] desire of the UK public to eat and drink out ... Our chief concern is that continued wet weather, the proliferation of \u2018dry January\u2019 and stock market turbulence will impact the current month and negate any gains made over the festive period.\u201d The British public has chosen to spend rising levels of disposable income on socialising; drinking at home, as well as in the pub, appears to be on trend.",

      "bodyText": "The like-for-like sales figures used by retailers to outline their performance at Christmas could be masking the financial problems they face and should not be used in isolation, leading auditors have warned. Auditors from the UK\u2019s six largest accountancy firms believe the figures are \u201cnot the best guide to retail success\u201d, according to a report compiled by trade body ICAEW. They said like-for-like sales ignore the cost to retailers of adapting to the online shopping revolution, introducing the \u201cnational living wage\u201d, and sharp currency fluctuations over the past year. The comments are the latest criticism of like-for-like sales, which have become the benchmark in the City for judging the performance of retailers. Like-for-like sales strip out the effects of adding new stores and space over the prior year, meaning a retailer only measures stores that were open a year ago. However, unlike many accounting rules, there is no formal industry standard. This means that some companies include new extensions to stores in their like-for-like sales, such as Sainsbury\u2019s, while others include sales generated by a customer paying with a voucher, and others strip out online sales. Some retailers, most notably Next, do not report like-for-like sales at all. The debate about like-for-like sales is more pronounced in January because it is when retailers reveal details about their performance during the vital Christmas season, normally with no reference to margins or profits. For example, Tesco has been heralded as one of the winners of Christmas after returning to like-for-like sales growth for the first time in four years, but its profit margins have been heavily eroded due to the price war with the discounters Aldi and Lidl. The ICAEW has called for new standards to be introduced for like-for-like sales. It said in the report: \u201cThe retailers who win Black Friday and Christmas are not necessarily those who have made the most like-for-like sales, but those who have made the most money. The most important information \u2013 which is sometimes overlooked \u2013 is how profitable is the like-for-like sales growth. \u201cRetailers are finding themselves squeezed between changes in consumer behaviour and expectations \u2013 such as greater demand for value and a stronger fight for the consumer pound, rising required investment in infrastructure, overall cost pressure and volatility in commodity prices, all of which are impacting on profit margins.\u201d Julie Carlyle, the chair of the ICAEW working group and head of retail at accounting and consultancy firm Ernst &amp; Young, said: \u201cLike for like is no longer the only indicator and cannot be looked at in isolation. \u201cInvestors need to focus on profit and companies need to ask how they can react to and plan for the new retail environment. What are the cost implications of the living wage, and can they increase productivity to respond? \u201cThere will be knock-on effects that they may not have considered \u2013 the [national] living wage doesn\u2019t just mean increasing pay for those at the bottom; businesses will need to adjust pay scales throughout in order to maintain morale and retain staff.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Sports Direct has \u201cabused\u201d the legal system, according to a high court judge presiding over the embattled retailer\u2019s bitter legal battle with Rangers football club. The latest denunciation came as the Sports Direct founder, Mike Ashley, said he would be inviting MPs to visit the company\u2019s depot in Shirebrook, Derbyshire, following the barrage of parliamentary criticism in December in the wake of a Guardian investigation. It found that the retailer was effectively paying thousands of temporary warehouse workers below the minimum wage. In the high court on Tuesday, Mr Justice Peter Smith took the surprising step of registering his disapproval of the company\u2019s approach in its fight with Rangers, after Sports Direct withdrew its claim for damages in the case. Previously, the sportswear chain failed to have the football club\u2019s chairman, Dave King, sent to prison over allegations that he had violated a gagging order. King has been accused of breaching a confidentiality agreement between Rangers and the FTSE 100 group after giving an interview to Sky Sports in July, during which he mentioned meetings related to contracts Rangers has with Sports Direct. Ashley, who owns 55% of the retailer, had claimed in his witness statement that the damage of the alleged breach and others ran into \u201cmillions of pounds\u201d. The company then claimed \u00a3200,000 in damages, a level that ensured the case would be heard in the high court, before reducing the claim to \u00a350,000 and then withdrawing it on Monday. Sports Direct is now asking for injunctions on the disclosure of its commercial deals with Rangers. After being told by Sports Direct lawyers that the company was no longer seeking damages, Smith said: \u201cThe whole way that the claimants have been conducting themselves [in relation to the damages] \u2026 shows that they have been abusing processes of the court.\u201d Smith also struck out sections of Ashley\u2019s witness statement that dealt with the alleged damages, which he said were not supported by a \u201cstatement of truth\u201d. William McCormick QC, for Rangers, told the judge: \u201cThey [Sports Direct] simply will not deal with us on a proper basis. I am sure it is not the lawyers. It must be because they are held by their instructions.\u201d The retailer\u2019s claim that King breached the confidentiality agreement will be heard in February. In December, when Sports Direct failed to have King sent to prison, Smith queried whether Ashley was interested in having a \u201csensible\u201d business relationship with the Rangers chairman \u201cor grinding him into the dust\u201d. The judge added: \u201cMaybe he is interested. I don\u2019t know.\u201d Gordon Dinnie, the chairman of the Rangers supporters trust, said: \u201cWe are delighted with the comments of Mr Justice Smith today. Sports Direct and Mike Ashley have been a malign influence on Rangers since they first became involved. Their treatment of the club and the fans has been nothing short of a disgrace. The type of abuse which Mr Justice Smith spoke about is precisely our experience.\u201d The high court comments follow the company being widely chastised by politicians, businesspeople and unions following the publication of the Guardian investigation last month. The coverage led to an urgent question and debate in parliament, calls for an investigation by HM Revenue &amp; Customs, and criticism from the Institute of Directors, which described Sports Direct as a \u201cscar on British business\u201d. Toby Perkins, the MP for Chesterfield, which is about 10 miles from the Shirebrook warehouse, tweeted a copy of a letter he received from Ashley, inviting him to discuss the recent controversies over working conditions at the plant. The MP later removed the tweet. The letter said that \u201ca small number\u201d of other MPs who have written to the tycoon would also be invited, although Dennis Skinner and John Mann, two of the local MPs most outspoken on Sports Direct, have yet to receive an invitation. On New Year\u2019s Eve, Sports Direct pledged \u00a310m for a pay rise for staff from the start of this year. Ashley has also promised to lead a review of all Sports Direct\u2019s temporary staff terms and conditions. The retailer did not comment.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The richest stand to gain more from the introduction of new technology than those in poorer sections of society, according to a report which warns that policymakers may be required to intervene to tackle the widening inequality. The so-called fourth industrial revolution, following on from the introduction of steam power, electricity and electronics, will have less of an impact on developed economies, such as Switzerland, Singapore and the UK. Emerging markets \u2013 notably in parts of Latin America and India \u2013 will suffer when artificial intelligence and robots become widely used, reducing the competitive advantage of their cheap labour. The report by Swiss bank UBS, published on Tuesday to coincide with the start of the World Economic Forum in Davos, warns that some skilled work is also at risk as robots become more sophisticated. Axel Weber, the chairman of UBS, said: \u201cInequality increases not just between developed and developing and emerging countries. It\u2019s also within our society. It will have an impact not only between the rich and the poor but also the young and the old.\u201d The report outlines a polarisation in the labour force and \u201cgreater income inequality imply[ing] larger gains for those at the top of the income, skills and wealth spectrums\u201d. \u201cThese individuals are likely to be best placed from a skills perspective to harness extreme automation and connectivity; they typically already have high savings rates and will benefit from holding more of the assets whose value will be boosted by the fourth industrial revolution,\u201d the report says. Last year, a report by Bank of America Merrill Lynch also pointed to the potential for a rise in inequality as a result of increased automation. That report cited research by Oxford University which said that up to 35% of all workers in the UK, and 47% of those in the US, are at risk of being displaced by technology over the next 20 years. The theme of this year\u2019s gathering of business leaders and policymakers in Davos is the introduction of new technology. The WEF organisers have already predicted that 7 million jobs could go in five years, with women losing out the most. Webber said it was up to policymakers to take steps to address any increases in inequality. The report by UBS points to downward pressure on the wages of low-skilled workers. \u201cBy contrast, the potential returns to highly skilled and more adaptable workers are increasing,\u201d the report says. \u201cMany labour-intensive firms should be able to boost profit margins as they substitute costly workers for cheaper robots or intelligent software ... For nations, the largest gains from the fourth industrial revolution are likely to be captured by those with the most flexible economies, adding a further incentive for governments to trim red tape and barriers to business. \u201cAutomation will continue to put downward pressure on the wages of the low skilled and is starting to impinge on the employment prospects of middle-skilled workers. By contrast, the potential returns to highly skilled and more adaptable workers are increasing.\u201d The US could \u201conshore\u201d work back from low-cost labour markets, the report added, putting emerging countries at a disadvantage. Workers already displaced by automation, such as those on assembly lines, could also feel the impact of the latest technology, as robots which are able to move around \u2013 so-called cobots \u2013 are able to perform more intricate tasks. \u201cThe greatest disruption, however, could be experienced by workers who have so far felt immune to robotic competition, namely those in middle-skill professions,\u201d the report says. It points to clerical work, such as customer service, being replaced by artificial intelligence. Insurance claims could also be settled without human intervention.",

Only a quarter of chief executives surveyed by PricewaterhouseCoopers were expecting global economic growth to improve this year.

      "bodyText": "The chief executive of Unilever, which makes Persil, PG Tips and Dove soap, has warned that the world could lurch from crisis to crisis this year as stock markets slump and Britain debates whether to leave the EU. Paul Polman warned of \u201chigh volatility\u201d and \u201cintensifying geopolitical instability\u201d in the world. \u201cLook at Europe. We move from the Greek crisis, to the Ukraine crisis, to the Spanish crisis, to the refugee [crisis]. Now we are creating a Polish crisis because they have different opinions, then we might get the Brexit or not,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we are basically moving from three-month crises to three-month crises. The longer-term issues that need to be addressed don\u2019t get full attention \u2013 climate change, food security, unemployment, income disparity. If we want to make this world function, we obviously have to work on those issues for the long term at the same time as we deal with the short-term issues.\u201d Polman was speaking as the Anglo-Dutch consumer goods group reported a 4.1% rise in underlying sales for 2015. This growth was driven by sales by of personal and home care products in emerging markets, as well as demand for tea and the company\u2019s ice-cream brands, such as Magnum. Unilever\u2019s operations in Europe and North America are under pressure, which it has tried to address by introducing premium versions of products including Dove. Pre-tax profits fell 6% year on year to \u20ac7.2bn (\u00a35.5bn), although Unilever said core operating profits, which strip out the profits from the sale of Ragu pasta sauce in 2014, rose 12% in 2015 compared with the previous year. This was ahead of City analyst expectations, sending shares in Unilever up 3%. However, Polman warned of more challenges ahead in 2016. Deploying a military acronym now used in business circles, he said: \u201cI believe we will live in a more VUCA world, I have used the word more than anyone else \u2013 volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous. \u201cThe financial markets have become totally interdependent, technology is adding to that, and the effects of climate change mean [that] one country\u2019s actions can affect another country. The world has become so interdependent at a time that political systems are moving away from each other to some extent. \u201cI don\u2019t think 2016 is going to be less volatile, if anything the year has started more volatile than last year.\u201d Unilever has expanded heavily into emerging markets such as China, Brazil and Russia, which now account for 60% of its sales. These once-booming economies are now struggling, with China\u2019s growth slowing, Brazil in recession and Russia struggling under western sanctions. Stock markets have struggled and the oil price has tumbled since the start of the year, raising concerns about the prospects for the global economy in 2016. Polman played down the threat of Britain voting to leave the UK to the company. Unilever was founded in 1930 by the merger of Dutch margarine maker Margarine Unie and British soapmaker Lever Brothers. It has corporate head offices in London and Rotterdam. Polman said Unilever had operations in the UK \u201cbecause the country has a size that justifies that\u201d. On the prospect of Brexit, he said: \u201cIt will mean that we carry on our business as usual because our competitive advantage will be the same to anybody else. Unilever is in 190 countries, and many of these countries are not part of Europe. So we manage that, we manage that very well. \u201cWe will have to adjust some things like any business, depending on the environment that is taking place, like we will have contingency plans if something happens with Greece. That is how you always have to be ready, there has to be something in the drawer so it is not a panic when the moment starts.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Oil market could drown in oversupply in 2016, says IEA", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The world could find itself drowning in oil this year and prices could fall further as new Iranian output cancels out production cuts elsewhere, according to the International Energy Agency. An increase in supply and weakening demand growth will ensure there is an overabundance of oil until late 2016 at the earliest, the IEA said in its January report. It said the result would be the third successive year when supply exceeded demand by 1m barrels a day, and the system would struggle to cope. The agency, which advises industrialised countries, said growth in global oil demand would be weaker in response to the slowing economy of China, whose manufacturing sector absorbs vast quantities of the world\u2019s oil output. At the same time, as a result of sanctions against Iran being lifted, the IEA estimates 285m barrels will be added to stocks this year. Production from non-Opec countries will fall by 600,000 barrels a day this year, but Iran\u2019s re-entry to the international market could fill the gap by the middle of 2016, putting further pressure on prices, the IEA said. \u201cWhile the pace of stockbuilding eases in the second half of the year as supply from non-Opec producers falls, unless something changes, the oil market could drown in oversupply,\u201d the IEA said. Brent crude oil dropped to a 13-year low of less than $28 a barrel on Monday after Iran\u2019s liberation from sanctions left it free to return to the export market. Iran\u2019s comeback threatens to increase the oversupply created by US shale drillers and Saudi Arabia\u2019s determination to keep pumping in an attempt to put smaller competitors out of business. On whether the oil price could fall further this year, the agency said: \u201cThe answer to our question is an emphatic yes. It could go lower.\u201d Warm early-winter temperatures in Europe, Japan and the US and economic gloom in China, Brazil, Russia and other commodity producers caused a sharp reversal in the oil market last year. Demand more than halved from 2.1m barrels a day in the third quarter, near a five-year high, to a year low of 1m barrels a day in the final quarter. The IEA said: \u201cMarkets were routed in December as persistent oversupply, bloated inventories and a slew of negative economic news pressured prices.\u201d The agency said it had expected demand growth to slow but the pace of the slowdown was a shock. It pointed to falling industrial usage in China, where demand for diesel plummeted in the fourth quarter. As storage space on land becomes scarce, it may become profitable to stockpile excess crude on tankers at sea to accommodate the oil glut, the IEA said. Markets had been expecting the lifting of sanctions against Iran for months but prices still fell in response because of the generally turbulent backdrop. The IEA questioned whether markets had fully understood the potential impact of the return of Iran, which has the world\u2019s fifth biggest oil reserves. \u201cThere are considerable uncertainties around the quality and quantity of oil that Iran can offer to the market in the short term and the not inconsiderable challenge of finding buyers willing to take more oil into an already glutted market. However, if Iran can move quickly to offer its oil under attractive terms, there may be more pricing in to come,\u201d the IEA said. For much of last year, the falling oil price was viewed as a benefit for the global economy because it cut costs for most companies and increased consumers\u2019 spending power. But fears have increased about the part played by weakening demand and slowing world growth in falling prices. Valeriya Vitkova, a researcher at Cass Business School, said: \u201cWhat has changed recently are concerns on the demand side of the equation, in particular from China and the US. Chinese growth has driven global oil demand in the last decade and any slowing in that growth rate, even if still growing, means the gap between supply and demand is unlikely to close.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Bank of England governor has sent the pound into a nosedive after he ruled out an early rise in interest rates, saying UK growth was still too weak and pointing to recent turmoil in the global financial markets. Speaking in London as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) downgraded its forecast for global growth this year, Mark Carney said the UK faced \u201ca powerful set of forces\u201d that prevented policymakers from raising rates. \u201cThe world is weaker and UK growth has slowed,\u201d he added. The recent plunge in oil prices and rapid slowdown in China are likely to keep inflation at or near zero. New UK inflation data on Tuesday showed prices increased by 0.2% over 2015, the smallest increase in annual inflation since the early 1960s. These factors are likely to delay the first increase in rates since 2008 from their record low of 0.5% until at least the end of this year, or possibly 2017. Many City economists had previously expected a rise this summer or in the autumn. Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said borrowing costs were unlikely to rise until the end of this year at the earliest. \u201cGiven Mark Carney\u2019s cautious tone and the increased possibility that consumer prices will stay lower for longer due to oil price weakness, limited earnings growth and growth headwinds, it is clear that the Bank of England could well delay acting until very late on in 2016, or even 2017,\u201d he said. Currency traders reacted to Carney\u2019s downbeat assessment by selling the pound to $1.42, its weakest since March 2009, and almost 5% weaker than where it was trading just a month ago. However, the FTSE 100 index closed up nearly 100 points, or 1.7%, as investors welcomed the prospect of cheap credit for a longer period than previously expected. Carney did not indicate when the Bank would make its move. \u201cThe year has turned and in my view the decision proved straightforward. Now is not yet the time to raise interest rates,\u201d he said at Queen Mary University of London. There was no timetable and the Bank would \u201cdo the right thing at the right time on rates\u201d, he said. \u201cMonetary policy will continue to depend on economic prospects and not the calendar.\u201d In the summer of 2014, Carney said a rate rise would come earlier than City economists expected, and last summer he said a decision would \u201ccome into sharper relief\u201d at the end of the year. In each case, an event outside the UK, first the eurozone crisis and then China\u2019s accelerated slowdown, has coupled with the government\u2019s austerity measures to undermine his forecasts. Carney emphasised that UK businesses were in rude health and primed to maintain their upbeat investment plans. He said the jobs market remained buoyant and the economy was expected to grow this year and next in line with the Bank\u2019s most recent forecasts. But there were many reasons for the UK to stick with low interest rates and not follow the lead set by the US Federal Reserve, which raised rates for the first time in nearly a decade in December. He said Britain was a more open economy and more susceptible to the global slowdown in demand for exports and investment. \u201cIt has always been the case that, because the economy is subject to unforeseen disturbances, the precise path for [the] Bank rate cannot be preordained,\u201d he said. \u201cFurther downside risks to the global outlook remain, reflecting the ongoing challenges in China, fragilities in other major emerging market economies and the potential for financial contagion.\u201d The IMF cut its growth forecasts for the next two years and warned that recovery from the financial crisis could be derailed if key challenges were mishandled. The Washington-based body said world output would be 0.2 points lower in 2016 and 2017, compared with forecasts made three months ago, and that the risks to its predictions were to the downside. In an update to its World Economic Outlook, the IMF put growth at 3.4% this year and 3.6% in 2017. It said central banks should continue to boost growth and finance ministries should bolster investment spending where possible. It warned that a \u201ctide of refugees\u201d was putting the EU under strain and that action was needed to ensure that migrants could find jobs. The Office for National Statistics blamed a 0.2% rise in prices during December on higher transport costs, particularly air fares, and to a lesser extent motor fuels. These were partly offset by downward pressure on prices for alcohol and tobacco along with food and non-alcoholic beverages. Monthly inflation, which has been between -0.1% and 0.1% for the past 11 months, finished the year at its lowest annual rate for 50 years. Under Carney\u2019s policy of forward guidance, falling unemployment was the key to rising inflation, as the increasing scramble for workers increased wages. In 2014, real wages began to rise for the first time since the financial crash and appeared to indicate an imminent rise in interest rates. Since last summer, however, a sharp slump in manufacturing output and a depressed construction sector have pulled down wages and heightened fears of a longer period of stagnation. Average wage rises have fallen from 3.25% to about 2.5%. Carney said he was concerned that low inflation was persuading employers to offer smaller wage rises, delaying the point at which the increasing costs of labour feed into the prices of goods on the high street. \u201cThe slowdown in the wage growth gives pause to the inference that the labour market is as tight as would be suggested by the drop in the unemployment rate,\u201d he said.",

Joanna Whittington, who joined from the energy watchdog Ofgem in 2014, has been promoted to lead the Office of Rail and Road (ORR), replacing Richard Price, who has stepped down two months before the end of his contract. During hearings into Network Rail\u2019s spending crisis last year, MPs on the public accounts committee accused the regulator of being \u201casleep on the job\u201d and demanded Price\u2019s resignation. Sources at the ORR said Price\u2019s departure was not linked to the hearings. The former chief executive had been seconded from his civil service job at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) on a five-year basis, due to end in March. However, the future shape of the ORR is in question as reviews continue into the debacle that saw promised upgrades to major rail lines cancelled due to massive overspending, including the tripling of the budget for electrifying the Great Western mainline. The ORR had insisted that Network Rail could deliver its 2014-19 programme for less than its \u00a338.3bn budget. An inquiry by Collette Bowe at the Department for Transport was heavily critical of the ORR, while an ongoing review into the financing of Network Rail by Nicola Shaw, head of the High Speed One rail line, could curb or alter the regulator\u2019s role.

The government-owned service told staff on Tuesday that it planned to close three branches in Belfast and Antrim in Northern Ireland and Barry in south Wales, and is seeking to transfer 39 outlets to franchise agreements with firms such as WH Smith. The plans are the latest step in a re-jig of the crown outlets, which are run directly by the Post Office. The Communication Workers Union (CWU) said a further 600 jobs could be at risk in the future because up to 50 more of the 314 current crown post offices could face closure over the next two years. The Post Office warned staff that it would have to make further changes over and above the closures and franchise deals announced on Tuesday, as part of plans to ensure it does not fall back into losses. It did not say how many more outlets might be affected, but unions believe the Post Office wants to reduce the crown network to 220 stores. Brian Scott, who represents Post Office workers at the Unite trade union, said: \u201cThis announcement by the Post Office is a slap in the face for Unite members, who have worked extremely hard over the past few years to eradicate losses.\u201d The CWU said: \u201cToday\u2019s announcement confirms that the government is attempting to privatise the Post Office and [is] continuing its agenda for destroying the service by diminishing its high street presence and taking away services, instead of embracing opportunities for new revenue streams.\u201d The Post Office said losses in the network of crown post office branches had been reduced from \u00a346m a year in 2011-12 and that part of its network was now breaking even. But limited opportunities for growth and high property costs in some locations meant some branches would not be able to make money, it added. Roger Gale, the general manager of the crown post office network, said: \u201cIn some locations, directly run crown post office branches work well, but in others there are alternatives, such as franchising, which can work better for the business and its customers, not just in terms of access to post office services but also in relation to long-term viability.\u201d \u201cWe have to continue to adapt to customer demands, which our network must reflect. We cannot look to the taxpayer to subsidise crown branches that lose money.\u201d Postal workers were involved in a series of strikes in protest against the franchising of crown post offices in 2013. In 2013, the Post Office proposed handing 70 crown offices over to franchises and 50 have already been put into private hands, including dozens now run by WH Smith. The high street retailer operates 109 Post Office outlets in its stores, about half of which are former crown outlets. Hundreds of long-term staff were made redundant when WH Smith took on an initial batch of post offices in 2006.",

    "webTitle": "More plastic than fish in the sea by 2050, says Ellen MacArthur", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "As a record-breaking sailor, Dame Ellen MacArthur has seen more of the world\u2019s oceans than almost anyone else. Now she is warning that there will be more waste plastic in the sea than fish by 2050, unless the industry cleans up its act. According to a new Ellen MacArthur Foundation report launched at the World Economic Forum on Tuesday, new plastics will consume 20% of all oil production within 35 years, up from an estimated 5% today. Plastics production has increased twentyfold since 1964, reaching 311m tonnes in 2014, the report says. It is expected to double again in the next 20 years and almost quadruple by 2050. Despite the growing demand, just 5% of plastics are recycled effectively, while 40% end up in landfill and a third in fragile ecosystems such as the world\u2019s oceans. Much of the remainder is burned, generating energy, but causing more fossil fuels to be consumed in order to make new plastic bags, cups, tubs and consumer devices demanded by the economy. Decades of plastic production have already caused environmental problems. The report says that every year \u201cat least 8m tonnes of plastics leak into the ocean \u2013 which is equivalent to dumping the contents of one garbage truck into the ocean every minute. If no action is taken, this is expected to increase to two per minute by 2030 and four per minute by 2050 \u201cIn a business-as-usual scenario, the ocean is expected to contain one tonne of plastic for every three tonnes of fish by 2025, and by 2050, more plastics than fish [by weight].\u201d A carelessly discarded plastic bag can break down in the sea, especially in warmer waters, but the process releases toxic chemicals that may be digested by fish and end up in the human food chain. Research released a year ago found there were more than 5tn pieces of plastic floating in the seas, many just 5mm across. Larger items can be a threat to sea life such as turtles and seals, which swallow them. Scientists have also found that countless tiny fragments drift to the bottom of the oceans, carpeting the sea bed. The environmental and health impact of this is unknown. The report concludes that the plastics industry is comprehensively failing to address these issues. Dr Martin R Stuchtey of the McKinsey Center for Business and Environment, who helped produce the report, said a wave of innovation could be transformative. \u201cPlastics are the workhorse material of the modern economy, with unbeaten properties,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever they are also the ultimate single-use material. Growing volumes of end-of-use plastics are generating costs and destroying value to the industry. After-use plastics could, with circular economy thinking, be turned into valuable feedstock.\u201d The plastics recycling industry is also reeling from the recent plunge in the price of oil. At $30 (\u00a321) a barrel, it is more expensive to recover plastics and process their hydrocarbons to recycle them than to use virgin crude. Solving the problem will not be easy, especially as the industry is under pressure to produce more to meet growing demand from emerging markets. Bioplastics are currently more expensive to make than the petro-alternative, and recycling systems are inefficient. MacArthur, who broke the record for the fastest solo circumnavigation of the globe in 2005, says fundamental reform is needed. Her vision is for a \u201cnew plastics economy\u201d in which the industry, governments and citizens work together to ensure that plastics never become waste and cut the leakage into natural systems. \u201cLinear models of production and consumption are increasingly challenged by the context within which they operate, and this is particularly true for high-volume, low-value materials such as plastic packaging,\u201d she said. One part of the solution is to rethink the way goods are packaged, cutting the demand for plastic. Water-soluble film, for example, can be used to wrap small items. Hard-to-recycle plastics such as PVC and expandable polystyrene could be phased out. Manufacturers could redesign plastic items so they can be reused better, and rethink their production methods to make recycling easier. More products could be made out of plastics which can be composted on an industrial scale, including rubbish bags for organic waste and food packaging for outdoor events, canteens and fast food outlets. The report admits, however, that a \u201cmoonshot\u201d approach is also needed, to create plastics that can be both recycled and composted. Currently it is one or the other. Other options are to develop \u201cbio-benign\u201d plastics, or chemical tagging to stop used plastics slipping through the system and into the sea.

Now she is warning that there will be more waste plastic in the sea than fish by 2050, unless the industry cleans up its act.</p> <p>According to <a href=\"http://www.ellenmacarthurfoundation.org/publications/the-new-plastics-economy-rethinking-the-future-of-plastics\">a new Ellen MacArthur Foundation report launched at the World Economic Forum on Tuesday</a>, new plastics will consume 20% of all oil production within 35 years, up from an estimated 5% today.</p> <p>Plastics production has increased twentyfold since 1964, reaching 311m tonnes in 2014, the report says. It is expected to double again in the next 20 years and almost quadruple by 2050.</p> <p>Despite the growing demand, just 5% of plastics are recycled effectively, while 40% end up in landfill and a third in fragile ecosystems such as the world\u2019s oceans.</p> <p>Much of the remainder is burned, generating energy, but causing more fossil fuels to be consumed in order to make new plastic bags, cups, tubs and consumer devices demanded by the economy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5b94bf7eecb1fae1e1e57e48743bc1b4f2c6bef2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5b94bf7eecb1fae1e1e57e48743bc1b4f2c6bef2/0_0_706_464/500.jpg\" alt=\"The oil cycle\" width=\"500\" height=\"329\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Decades of plastic production have already caused environmental problems. </p> <p>The report says that every year \u201cat least 8m tonnes of plastics leak into the ocean \u2013 which is equivalent to dumping the contents of one garbage truck into the ocean every minute. If no action is taken, this is expected to increase to two per minute by 2030 and four per minute by 2050</p> <p>\u201cIn a business-as-usual scenario, the ocean is expected to contain one tonne of plastic for every three tonnes of fish by 2025, and by 2050, more plastics than fish [by weight].\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d285812a48bb81cda0e6724e3efbab9cd7f8e0dd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d285812a48bb81cda0e6724e3efbab9cd7f8e0dd/0_0_664_443/500.jpg\" alt=\"Plastics in the sea, today and in 2050\" width=\"500\" height=\"334\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>A carelessly discarded plastic bag can break down in the sea, especially in warmer waters, but the process releases toxic chemicals that may be digested by fish and end up in the human food chain.</p> <p>Research released a year ago found there were more than 5tn pieces of plastic floating in the seas, many just 5mm across. Larger items can be a threat to sea life such as turtles and seals, which swallow them.</p> <p>Scientists have also found that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/dec/17/microplastic-deposits-found-deep-in-worlds-oceans-and-seas\">countless tiny fragments drift to the bottom of the oceans, carpeting the sea bed</a>. The environmental and health impact of this is unknown. </p> <p>The report concludes that the plastics industry is comprehensively failing to address these issues.</p> <p>Dr Martin R Stuchtey of the McKinsey Center for Business and Environment, who helped produce the report, said a wave of innovation could be transformative.</p> <p>\u201cPlastics are the workhorse material of the modern economy, with unbeaten properties,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever they are also the ultimate single-use material. Growing volumes of end-of-use plastics are generating costs and destroying value to the industry. After-use plastics could, with circular economy thinking, be turned into valuable feedstock.\u201d</p> <p>The plastics recycling industry is also reeling from the recent plunge in the price of oil. At $30 (\u00a321) a barrel, it is more expensive to recover plastics and process their hydrocarbons to recycle them than to use virgin crude.</p> <p>Solving the problem will not be easy, especially as the industry is under pressure to produce more to meet growing demand from emerging markets. Bioplastics are currently more expensive to make than the petro-alternative, and recycling systems are inefficient.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7fca255f1a403b7c7809726e0e538a4948d2ad27\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7fca255f1a403b7c7809726e0e538a4948d2ad27/0_56_2919_1753/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ellen MacArthur\" width=\"1000\" height=\"601\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ellen MacArthur has become an advocate for \u2018circular economy\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Linda Nylind for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>MacArthur, who broke the record for the fastest solo circumnavigation of the globe in 2005, says fundamental reform is needed. Her vision is for a \u201cnew plastics economy\u201d in which the industry, governments and citizens work together to ensure that plastics never become waste and cut the leakage into natural systems.</p> <p>\u201cLinear models of production and consumption are increasingly challenged by the context within which they operate, and this is particularly true for high-volume, low-value materials such as plastic packaging,\u201d she said.</p> <p>One part of the solution is to rethink the way goods are packaged, cutting the demand for plastic. Water-soluble film, for example, can be used to wrap small items. Hard-to-recycle plastics such as PVC and expandable polystyrene could be phased out.</p> <p>Manufacturers could redesign plastic items so they can be reused better, and rethink their production methods to make recycling easier. More products could be made out of plastics which can be composted on an industrial scale, including rubbish bags for organic waste and food packaging for outdoor events, canteens and fast food outlets.</p> <p>The report admits, however, that a \u201cmoonshot\u201d approach is also needed, to create plastics that can be both recycled and composted. Currently it is one or the other. Other options are to develop \u201cbio-benign\u201d plastics, or chemical tagging to stop used plastics slipping through the system and into the sea.</p> <ul> <li><em>MacArthur will be outlining the issues on Friday at the WEF\u2019s annual meeting in Davos.</em><br></li> </ul>",

      "bodyText": "Mark Carney is halfway through his five-year term as governor of the Bank of England. Judging by his latest remarks on the state of the economy, he could go back to Canada in the summer of 2018 and still not have raised interest rates. The governor\u2019s speech was notable for its dovish tone. Six months ago, in a speech in Lincoln, he said the decision on whether to increase the cost of borrowing would come into sharper relief around the turn of the year. That was seen as an indication that a tightening of policy would be announced sooner rather than later. Well, the turn of the year has arrived, Carney has decided that the time is not yet ripe for a rate rise. Marching the markets up to the top of the interest rate hill only to march them down again has become a bit of a habit. For all that, the governor\u2019s caution is justified. Carney said a \u201cpowerful set of forces\u201d \u2013 some domestic, some global, some long-lasting, some cyclical \u2013 had combined to keep interest rates at their record low rates since the Great Recession ended in 2009. And he cited three developments that had pushed back the likely date for rates to rise. Firstly, there is no sign of the economy picking up momentum. The UK grew at a robust rate in 2014 but cooled off in 2015: growth averaged around 0.5% a quarter \u2013 slightly below its long-term trend. Secondly, unemployment has continued to fall but wages pressures have been noticeable by their absence. In part, the Bank thinks this is due to the fact that job creation has been concentrated in poorly paid jobs. But Carney also believes that the low level of inflation \u2013 still only at 0.2% after its rise in December \u2013 has played a part. Employers have used zero inflation as the starting point for pay talks, and see 2% as a generous offer in the current climate. Finally, core inflation \u2013 the cost of living with items such as energy and food stripped out \u2013 remains well below the government\u2019s 2% inflation target. When the US Federal Reserve raised rates in December, there was speculation in the City that the Bank would follow suit relatively quickly. That is no longer the case, and Carney was at pains to point out that the UK was more vulnerable to tremors in the global economy and had to cope with George Osborne\u2019s austerity drive. Unsurprisingly, the pound fell as soon as Carney started speaking. A rate rise in the first half of 2016 is a non-starter. A rate rise in the second half of 2016 is becoming a more remote possibility by the month. Sentiment can change swiftly, of course, and if the global storm blows over and inflationary pressure starts to build, rates could go up more quickly than currently forecast. There has, though, been gossip recently about Carney extending his term of office. It may be only way he will ever get to announce an increase in borrowing costs.",

The result of a \u00a335m investment, it features online exclusives as well as the bestselling wines already in the shops. Shoppers will be able to order whether they live near an Aldi or not, although deliveries are not available in Northern Ireland. Delivery is free for orders over \u00a350, but smaller orders will cost \u00a33.

Barnes went on: \u201cWe regularly receive feedback from customers who are astonished by the outstanding quality of our wines and so we\u2019re particularly keen to expand into new parts of the country where we don\u2019t currently have physical stores. Selling online is an important step forward for our business.\u201d In the second quarter of the year, Aldi is to start selling non-food items, known as Specialbuys, online. These items, currently available in stores, range from cycling gear to power tools and Halloween outfits. The retailer currently operates over 630 UK stores and plans to open a further 83 this year, putting it on course to reach 1,000 by 2022.",

      "bodyText": "The International Monetary Fund has added to concerns about the health of the global economy by cutting its growth forecasts for the next two years and warning that recovery from the financial crisis could be derailed altogether if key challenges are mishandled. The Washington-based body said world output would be 0.2 points lower in 2016 and 2017 compared with forecasts made just three months ago \u2013 and that the risks to its predictions were to the downside. In an update to its World Economic Outlook, the IMF said growth was put at 3.4% this year and 3.6% in 2017. It said central banks should continue to boost growth and that finance ministries should bolster investment spending where possible. It also warned that a \u201ctide of refugees\u201d was putting the EU under strain and that action was needed to ensure that migrants could find jobs. The IMF said: \u201cRisks to the global outlook remain tilted to the downside and relate to ongoing adjustments in the global economy: a generalised slowdown in emerging market economies, China\u2019s rebalancing, lower commodity prices, and the gradual exit from extraordinarily accommodative monetary conditions in the United States. If these key challenges are not successfully managed, global growth could be derailed.\u201d It added that the downward revisions largely reflected a more pessimistic view of the prospects for some countries in the emerging world since October. Brazil\u2019s recession was proving to be deeper and more protracted than previously estimated, while the forecasts for Russian and Saudi Arabian growth have also been cut. Brazil, Russia and Saudi Arabia have been badly affected by the falling oil price, which has crashed further since the IMF updated the WEO. The forecasts assume an oil price of almost $42 a barrel in 2016, substantially higher than Monday\u2019s level of about $28. The IMF also shaved 0.2 points off its growth estimates for the US in 2016 and 2017, noting that the economy was seen as marking time rather than gaining momentum. Output in the world\u2019s biggest economy is expected to expand by 2.5%, rising to 2.6% in both of the following two years. European growth is expected to be 1.7% in 2016, an upward revision of 0.1 percentage points on October, with no change to the 1.7% pencilled in for 2017. The IMF has left its forecasts for the UK \u2013 of 2.2% in 2016 and 2017 \u2013 unchanged. The Fund has also retained its October forecasts for the Chinese economy, which it expects to slow from growth of 6.9% in 2015 to 6.3% in 2016 and 6% in 2017. \u201cWith the projected pickup in growth being once again weaker than previously expected and the balance of risks remaining tilted to the downside, raising actual and potential output through a mix of demand support and structural reforms is even more urgent,\u201d the IMF said. \u201cIn advanced economies, where inflation rates are still well below central banks\u2019 targets, accommodative monetary policy remains essential. Where conditions allow, near-term fiscal policy should be more supportive of the recovery, especially through investments that would augment future productive capital.\u201d It added that where governments did need to reduce big budget deficits, action should be \u201cgrowth friendly and equitable\u201d. The Fund said inflation had moved sideways in most countries, but noted that the renewed declines in commodity prices and a glut of cheap manufactured goods meant further downward pressure on the cost of living was now in prospect. \u201cIn Europe, where the tide of refugees is presenting major challenges to the absorptive capacity of European Union labour markets and testing political systems, policy actions to support the integration of migrants into the labour force are critical to allay concerns about social exclusion and long-term fiscal costs, and unlock the potential long-term economic benefits of the refugee inflow.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "UK inflation rises unexpectedly", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "There was a surprise rise in the UK\u2019s inflation rate to 0.2% in December, the first month since January 2015 in which the rate has exceeded 0.1% according to the Office for National Statistics. Transport costs, particularly air fares, and to a lesser extent motor fuels, were the main contributors to the rise, said the ONS. These were partly offset by downward pressure on prices for alcohol and tobacco along with food and non-alcoholic beverages. Monthly inflation has been between -0.1% and 0.1% for the past eleven months, helped by plunging commodity prices. But house price inflation, which is not in the CPI index, continues to run far ahead of general inflation. The ONS said UK house prices increased by 7.7% in the year to November 2015, up from 7.0% in the year to October 2015. The biggest rises were in the east of England. Measured by the retail prices index, which is still used to set some train ticket prices and pension payments, and is calculated to include housing costs, inflation was 1.2% in the year ending December 2015, up from from 1.1% in November 2015. Last week, the Bank of England left interest rates unchanged at 0.5%, with expectations growing that there will be no rise in base rate throughout 2016. Analysts expect inflation to remain well below the Bank of England\u2019s 2% target for the rest of the year. ONS head of CPI James Tucker said: \u201cToday\u2019s small rise in CPI was mainly down to air fares and motor fuels, partially offset by falls in alcohol and food prices.\u201d \u201cWhile this modest rise takes CPI to its highest level for 11 months, it is still at historically low levels.\u201d Sterling, which has fallen steeply in recent weeks against the euro and the dollar as expectations of rate rise have receded, rebounded following the release of the data. This morning it was up 0.6% against the euro to 1.315 and up 0.5% against the dollar to 1.432. Producer price inflation, which measures the price of goods bought and sold by UK manufactuers, continued to fall in the year to December 2015. The ONS said factory gate inflation fell by 1.2% in December, although this was slightly less than the November figure of 1.5%. Manufacturers have benefitted hugely from the fall in commodity prices, with the overall cost of \u2018input\u2019s down 10.8% in the year to December 2015. Maike Currie, investment director, Fidelity International said: \u201cToday\u2019s figures show UK prices increased incrementally to 0.2% in December, and while this is the first month since January 2015 that the rate exceeded 0.1%, the trend of near-zero inflation is expected to continue as a slowdown in the emerging world and the global manufacturing sector puts a dampener on demand. \u201cPersistently weak inflation means there is little incentive for the Bank of England to raise interest rates. Those wanting an early rise may point out that the big falls in food and petrol prices in early 2015 will soon drop out of the inflation numbers in coming months. \u201cHowever, as these temporary pressures wane, the key drivers determining the future path of inflation will increasingly be domestic costs, specifically labour costs. In this light, markets will no doubt keep a close eye on tomorrow\u2019s employment numbers. Bank of England governor Mark Carney has said he wants to see annual wage growth of about 3%, among other factors, before the time is right for the Bank of England to move on rates.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "China\u2019s economy grew at its slowest rate in a quarter of a century in 2015, data released on Tuesday showed, increasing pressure on Beijing to address fears of a prolonged slowdown and ease the jitters affecting global markets. The full-year growth of 6.9% was only just short of government expectations of 7% but by contrast, growth in 2014 stood at 7.3%. The national bureau of statistics\u2019 bulletin showed GDP growth at 6.8% in the three months to December, easing from 6.9% in the previous quarter \u2013 the slowest quarterly rate since 2009, when growth slowed to 6.2%. The slide from the previous quarter was expected, but will add to concerns about the health of the world\u2019s second-biggest economy as it confronts a range of challenges, including weak exports, high debt levels and slowing investment. China\u2019s industrial output in December rose 5.9% from a year earlier, compared with forecasts for a 6.0% increase. The lack of surprises did at least offer some respite to stock and currency markets. MSCI\u2019s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was up 0.2% on Tuesday after earlier touching its lowest level since October 2011. Australian shares added 0.8%, while Tokyo\u2019s Nikkei dropped 0.3%. In Shanghai, recent volatility gave way to a 0.2% rise, following a 13-month low on Monday. The US dollar nudged up 0.2% to 117.55 yen after slipping last week to a four-and-a-half-month low of 116.51. Analysts were cautiously optimistic about the China\u2019s fortunes following the tumult of the past few weeks. \u201cI think that at least the biggest fears about the real economy, fears that came to the surface during the stock market rout ... I think those biggest fears were overblown,\u201d said Louis Kuijs, head of Asia economics at Oxford Economics in Hong Kong. \u201cWe don\u2019t see signs of an abrupt slowdown, or something getting worse than we had expected say six weeks ago.\u201d Gordon Kwan, a Hong Kong-based analyst at Nomura Holdings, said: \u201cChina\u2019s GDP growth is not collapsing, even though the fourth-quarter figures are slightly lower than expectations.\u201d Kwan said he expected additional government stimulus, but added that the Chinese economy was \u201cin decent shape, despite the recent hype about how it is on the verge of collapse\u201d. He believed the rest of the world would take positives from Tuesday\u2019s data. \u201cJudging by what\u2019s happening in the markets now, there will be a sigh of relief that quarterly growth was 6.8% and not, say 6%,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s early days yet \u2013 the real test will be the first-quarter GDP figures.\u201d Policymakers in Beijing have struggled to arrest the slide in China\u2019s fortunes, with some analysts predicting growth of about 6.5% this year even if, as many expect, the authorities unveil fresh spending packages and cut interest rates again. Other industrialised economies would find little to complain about if they enjoyed growth figures approaching those released on Tuesday, but in the Chinese context the data are cause for concern. Having experienced double-digit growth for more than a decade \u2013 during which it replaced Japan as the world\u2019s second-biggest economy \u2013 China is now going through a painful period of readjustment as growth inevitably slows. Its structural transformation from an economy heavily reliant on industrial exports to a more service-oriented one was still in progress, the statistics bureau said in a statement. It added that China was going through \u201ca crucial period during which challenges need to be overcome and problems need to be resolved and the task of comprehensively deepening the reform is still heavy\u201d. China\u2019s uncertain handling of its transition has sent shockwaves around global markets. Shanghai stocks have plunged to 13-month lows despite a massive government rescue package. The central bank, meanwhile, has added to confusion by allowing the yuan to weaken sharply, then intervening to stop the fall. Intervention has done little to ease investor unrest. Despite six interest rate cuts since November 2014, and reductions in the amount of cash that banks must hold as reserves, high debt levels in the Chinese economy mean the measures have had limited impact. Analysts predicted more instability for the global economy for the rest of the year. \u201cRegardless of whether Q4 growth was 6.8% or 6.9%, we do not expect full-year GDP to change the evolving narrative about the weak state of global demand,\u201d analysts at PRC Macro Advisors said.",

Matt Garbutt, the chief of staff of the Business Council of Australia, said the research showed that young people recognised they would need to retrain and re-skill multiple times during their working life. \u201cIn this context it is vital young people are equipped with a broad base of skills \u2013 both technical skills and cognitive skills such as communication and the ability to work in a team, to enable them to be flexible and resilient,\u201d he said. \u201cThe council believes the education system has an important role to play in not only educating and training young people, but also providing opportunities for them to gain an understanding how businesses operate and the expectations of employers.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The world\u2019s political and business leaders, plus the usual smattering of celebrities \u2013 including Leonardo DiCaprio \u2013 are heading to Davos, the Swiss Alpine resort where the World Economic Forum\u2019s annual conference begins on Tuesday evening. The ensuing four days of debate will focus on the following themes: The rise of the robots The relentless rise of automation and ever more intelligent machines will be a key issue at the WEF. The official theme of the 2016 meeting is \u201cmastering the fourth industrial revolution\u201d. That, in WEF-speak, means the \u201cfusion of technologies that is blurring the lines between the physical, digital and biological spheres\u201d. For some Davos attendees, this means business opportunities. Top executives such as Satya Nadella of Microsoft and Facebook\u2019s Sheryl Sandberg will debate how the new industrial revolution could improve industry and society. But Davos will also look at the threat to white collar jobs, asking if the changes are \u201cfailing the middle classes\u201d. Another question is whether we are heading towards \u201ca world without work\u201d \u2013 a serious issue given that some experts reckon one in two jobs could eventually be taken by intelligent automation. More than 7m jobs are at risk in the world\u2019s largest economies over the next five years, according to a WEF report published on Monday, with women losing out more than men as they are less likely to be working in areas where the adoption of new technology will create jobs. And if the daily trudge through icy Davos does not provide enough shivers, attendees will be told the implications of smart machines going to war. Sir Roger Carr, the chairman of defence giant BAE Systems, will discuss whether robots will become soldiers and generals, along with experts such as Prof Alan Winfield of the University of the West of England. Terrorism and the migration crisis World leaders and the heads of humanitarian agencies will debate how to address the growing migration crisis and better integrate refugees into the communities who shelter them. Queen Rania of Jordon will discuss the Middle East turmoil driving millions overseas, as desperate people continue to risk the winter cold and storms by crossing the Mediterranean. The leaders of Iraq and Tunisia are also attending. The EU foreign affairs chief, Federica Mogherini, and the French minister Emmanuel Macron are to consider whether Europe has been pushed to a tipping point by the crisis and discuss recent terrorist attacks. John Kerry, the US secretary of state, is giving a keynote speech. Last year, he delivered an electrifying talk on the need to tackle violent extremism and the \u201cmonsters\u201d of Islamic State. But it is not just talk. Delegates can choose to be jolted out of their comfortable existence by spending an hour experiencing a day in the life of a refugee. This has become a regular event at Davos, with some people being moved to tears by a taste of the trauma felt by displaced people. Some former refugees are also on hand to share their stories. Angela Merkel won\u2019t be signing up, though. With criticism over her refugee policies rising by the day, the chancellor is skipping this year\u2019s event. So Germany\u2019s president, Joachim Gauck, will be carrying the black, red and gold flag instead. Market turmoil The stock market rout of 2016 has already made a small dent in the large fortunes of the Davos elite. So there will be plenty of nervous chatter about whether we are heading into a new crash \u2013 and whether it can be fended off. The big worry, of course, is China, with its slowing economy and swelling credit levels. One of the Chinese government\u2019s top market regulators, Fang Xinghai, will update the global elite on wherethe economy is heading, alongside the IMF chief, Christine Lagarde. Jack Ma, the head of Chinese online retailer Alibaba, could also be in demand for his insights. With crude prices falling below $30 per barrel, the energy ministers of the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait will talk publicly about how Arab economies can reform to handle cheap oil. Argentina\u2019s new president, Mauricio Macri, is to discuss how emerging economies could suffer from the turmoil. Macri has just experienced his own painful shock; he is nursing a cracked rib after an incident playing with his daughter. No fewer than 10 central bank governors are descending on the ski resort, a chance to consider whether they will need to do more to help the global economy this year. Climate change The WEF hopes to build on the Paris climate deal, agreed in December, by examining how governments and businesses can work together to cut carbon emissions. Its annual risk survey found that failing to deal with and prepare for climate change is the biggest single threat facing the world economy. This is the first time in more than a decade that environmental issues have topped the list of worries. A string of top scientists will be providing technical expertise on how to tackle global warming and create cleaner energy. This includes the Solar Impulse team, which broke the world record for the longest solo flight in an un-refuelled vehicle last summer. DiCaprio will also be pushing for action; his foundation helps protect threatened ecosystems and funds projects to shield wildlife from the impact of climate change. Europe Turmoil in the Middle East and in the markets has pushed the eurozone debt problems down the agenda. But it still provides hope of a verbal punch-up, when the Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, and the German finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, discuss the future of Europe. Memories of last summer\u2019s crisis, where Tsipras was forced into a painful third bailout deal, are still fresh. Tsipras is also expected to meet with Lagarde. On the agenda: debt relief and pension reforms. The European Central Bank president, Mario Draghi, will be giving his own assessment of the eurozone economy on Friday morning, fresh from a governing council meeting the day before. David Cameron is also attending; Davos could give him an opportunity to push for EU reform ahead of Britain\u2019s referendum on membership. But he could also have his ear bent by business leaders who fear a UK exit. Inequality This annual gathering of the global elite is a perfect opportunity to remind them about wealth inequality. Oxfam already got the ball rolling before some Davos attendees had even reached the ski resort, with a new report warning that wealth is becoming increasingly concentrated in the hands of a small group of billionaires. Save the Children will warn that the fourth industrial revolution risks deepening the gap between rich and poor. That is because automation can destroy job opportunities for those with few educational qualifications, hollowing out labour markets in the developing world. Medicine The US vice-president, Joe Biden, is heading to Davos to push his \u201cmoonshot\u201d initiative to find a cure for cancer. Biden, leading a heavyweight US delegation, will meet with top scientists, doctors and data researchers in an attempt to speed up the fight against the disease which claimed his son Beau in May 2015. Last week, Biden said \u201ccancer politics\u201d were holding back progress and called for more data sharing about patient information and treatment outcomes. Davos is an opportunity to push that message. Ebola will also be on the agenda. Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance is expected to announce an agreement with pharmaceuticals company Merck to help prepare for the next outbreak. Last summer, tests showed that Merck\u2019s experimental ebola vaccine was 100% effective in providing immunity to a disease that killed more than 11,000 people last year. But the world will always face new threats: Bill Gates is to lead a discussion on how to prepare for the next pandemic. Cybercrime and civil liberties Davos will see a clash between the authorities, which want closer control of our digital communications, and campaigners, who fear privacy is being eroded. The US attorney general, Loretta Lynch, and J\u00fcrgen Stock, the head of Interpol, will be pushing for closer partnerships with companies and new laws to catch cybercriminals across the globe. Salil Shetty, the secretary general of Amnesty International, is due to talk about how privacy and secrecy has changed in a world of digital communication and new terrorist threats.",
