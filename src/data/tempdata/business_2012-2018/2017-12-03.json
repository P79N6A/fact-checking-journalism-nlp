      "bodyText": "Adani Group\u2019s Carmichael coal project will not be financed by the China Construction Bank, according to a statement by a public relations firm that says it represents the bank. If true, the news could be a blow to Adani\u2019s plans to build Australia\u2019s largest coal mine. It has turned to China for finance, following difficulties in getting subsidies from the Australian government. The big Australian banks have ruled out lending to the project, and with Labor set to maintain government in Queensland, its promise to veto a potential federal loan to Adani means Australian government funding is unlikely to go ahead. In November, it was revealed that Adani was looking to work with the China Machinery Engineering Corporation (CMEC) on building the railway that would link Carmichael coalmine to the Abbot Point coal terminal, so it could ship the coal out through the Great Barrier Reef. The state-owned China Construction Bank is the second largest bank in the world, and one thought to have a strategic alliance with CMEC, which could allow the Carmichael project to access subsidised Chinese government loans. But in a statement to the financial activist group Market Forces, a representative from PR firm The Continuum Partners said the firm was representing China Construction Bank in Australia, and that it was not working with Adani on the project. \u201cChina Construction Bank is not involved with, nor considering involvement with, the Adani Carmichael Mine project,\u201d the Continuum Partner\u2019s representative said, saying she should be quoted as \u201ca spokesperson for China Construction Bank in Australia\u201d. The executive director of Market Forces, Julien Vincent, said: \u201cThis statement is a huge blow to Adani, which had turned to China as its last hope to secure finance for their Carmichael mega coal mine and had been boasting about their prospects. \u201cChina Construction Bank is one of the biggest banks in the world, over 10 times the size of Commonwealth Bank. As a lender to China Machinery Engineering Corporation\u2019s recent overseas coal projects, Adani would have been salivating at the prospect of securing finance from CCB. \u201cThe fact that CCB is actively ruling out finance for the Carmichael coal project before receiving an approach says a lot about just how toxic this project is to investors. \u201cChina Construction Bank becomes the 25th commercial bank \u2013 and by far the biggest \u2013 to rule out finance for Adani\u2019s Carmichael mega coal mine,\u201d Vincent said. China Construction Bank is just one of few big Chinese banks that could provide subsidised loans to the project. Most such loans would come with the condition that the project benefited China by relying on Chinese materials or services. CMEC is also understood to have worked with the Export-Import Bank of China, but could potentially give Adani access to Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) or the China Development Bank. On Sunday, the ICBC published a statement denying it was a possible financier. \u201cICBC has not been, and does not intend to be, engaged in arranging financing for this project,\u201d it said. \u201cICBC attaches great importance to its social responsibilities and keenly promotes \u2018green financing\u2019. In Australia ICBC has provided financing to a series of renewable energy projects.\u201d Tim Buckley, from the pro-renewables Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, said that the news, if accurate, was very significant, butdid leave open the possibility for the project to be funded by another Chinese bank. \u201cAt the end of the day, any one of these big Chinese banks could fund 100% of the project tomorrow if they wanted. They\u2019re that big,\u201d he said. Adani Group declined to comment.",

    "webTitle": "Financial markets could be over-heating, warns central bank body", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Investors are ignoring warning signs that financial markets could be overheating and consumer debts are rising to unsustainable levels, the global body for central banks has warned in its quarterly financial health check. The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) said the situation in the global economy was similar to the pre-2008 crash era when investors, seeking high returns, borrowed heavily to invest in risky assets, despite moves by central banks to tighten access to credit. The BIS, known as the central bankers\u2019 bank, said attempts by the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England to choke off risky behaviour by raising interest rates had failed so far and unstable financial bubbles were continuing to grow. Claudio Borio, the head of the BIS, said central banks might need to reconsider changing the way they communicated base interest rate rises or the speed at which they were increasing rates to jolt investors into recognising the need to calm asset markets. \u201cThe vulnerabilities that have built around the globe during the long period of unusually low interest rates have not gone away. High debt levels, in both domestic and foreign currency, are still there. And so are frothy valuations. \u201cWhat\u2019s more, the longer the risk-taking continues, the higher the underlying balance sheet exposures may become. Short-run calm comes at the expense of possible long-run turbulence,\u201d he said. The warning came as Neil Woodford, one of the UK\u2019s most high-profile fund managers, said stock markets were in danger of crashing, resulting in huge losses for millions of people. The founder of Woodford Investment Management, which manages \u00a315bn worth of assets, told the Financial Times that investors were at risk of the market experiencing a repeat of the dotcom crash of the early 2000s. Woodford said he was concerned that historically low levels of interest rates in most developed nations over the last decade were pushing asset prices to unsustainable levels. \u201cTen years on from the global financial crisis, we are witnessing the product of the biggest monetary policy experiment in history,\u201d he said. \u201cInvestors have forgotten about risk and this is playing out in inflated asset prices and inflated valuations. \u201cThere are so many lights flashing red that I am losing count.\u201d The BIS said the benign global economy, which is predicted by the International Monetary Fund to see growth accelerate next year to 3.7% from 3.6% this year, was encouraging investors to dismiss concerns about high debt levels and growing asset bubbles. Economists have become concerned that high-risk investments such as European junk bonds yield similar returns to relatively safe investments such as US government bonds. There are also concerns that some of the most popular investment vehicles such as exchange-traded funds are backed with vast sums of borrowed money. Woodford also noted that measures of volatility in financial markets had stayed low for an unprecedentedly long period, indicating that investors were betting that the current economic benign period would continue and asset prices would increase for several more years. The BIS was one of the few organisations to warn during 2006 and 2007 about the unstable levels of bank lending on risky assets such as the US subprime mortgages that eventually led to the Lehman Brothers crash and the financial crisis. The organisation\u2019s chief economist at the time, William White, who now chairs the OECD\u2019s review committee, warned last year that global debt levels had escalated to unstable levels largely in response to almost zero interest rates to create a situation that was \u201cworse than 2007\u201d. Borio was more circumspect, but said the current attempts to tighten credit with gradual interest rate rises had failed to deter risky behaviour. \u201cCan a tightening be considered effective if financial conditions \u2026 ease?,\u201d he said. \u201cEven as the Fed has proceeded with its tightening, overall financial conditions have eased. If financial conditions are the main transmission channel for tighter policy, has policy, in effect, been tightened at all?\u201d The Bank of England has repeatedly expressed concern about mounting consumer debt in the UK. The BIS has ranked the UK among the most vulnerable countries in terms of households\u2019 debt service burdens, especially if interest rates were to be raised rapidly. Last week the UK\u2019s central bank reported that consumer debt in October had grown by 9.6%, more than four times the average for wage increases of 2.2%.

      "bodyText": "Fresh details have emerged of how Ryanair cabin crew are put under pressure to boost in-flight sales, including the posting of league tables of staff performances at the airline\u2019s bases. Photographs and documents obtained by the Guardian show how staff at Ryanair\u2019s Barcelona base, one of its key European airports, are judged against strict sales targets and are named if they do not meet them. Tactics include displaying league tables of staff who have racked up the highest sales, targets for how much passengers should be spending on specific flights and figures showing how far below that target crew have fallen. Cabin crew said that if they failed to hit targets they were threatened with disciplinary measures or arbitrary changes to less convenient shift patterns. Ryanair told the Guardian last month that its recruitment agency WorkForce, which provides cabin crew to the airline, did not set targets for staff deemed to be failing in their sales skills. But internal documents, coupled with testimony from staff, suggest sales targets are at the heart of cabin crew duties. One document shows \u201cactual spend targets\u201d alongside the sales that the crew member achieved, together with a blank section inviting staff to explain any occasion when they \u201cfailed to reach \u20ac50 in revenue\u201d. Another shows a league table of cabin crew\u2019s scratchcard sales, revealing that one staff member sold \u20ac1,292 of the cards in September alone, while the leading perfume seller racked up sales of \u20ac1,891 in the same month. Other documents show rankings for junior cabin crew rating their performance based on whether they met overall on-board sales targets. The top seller pulled in \u20ac5,443.60 from May to October but still fell 14.55% short of their target. The crew room also features a noticeboard dominated by a note reading: \u201cMinimum spend to achieve in your flights.\u201d Data on the noticeboard reveals the Ryanair flights to and from Barcelona airport that are the most lucrative, with flights from the Lithuanian capital, Vilnius, listed as the most likely to yield high sales. But a crew member who has seen more recent noticeboard posts said the most money-spinning flights were from Birmingham, which has a budget of \u20ac4.37 per passenger, and Stansted (\u20ac4.33). Based on a typical Ryanair aircraft, a Boeing 737 with a capacity of 189 people, the sales target for these flights is more than \u20ac800. Ryanair operates more than 600,000 flights per year. The crew member, who is employed by Crewlink, another recruitment agency that provides staff for Ryanair, said those who failed to reach targets felt interrogated. \u201cAt the end of the day we go back to the crew room and we get a debriefing from the base supervisor,\u201d said the person, who provided credentials but asked to remain anonymous to protect their job. \u201cIf the targets are not achieved (almost always) we are asked why, what happened, how can it be that you didn\u2019t reach the target in two-hour flights. Did you pass again with the trolley? Did you make good selling announcements?\u201d The cabin crew member said staff feared demotion or having their shift patterns changed to less favourable hours if they did not meet sales requirements. The person showed the Guardian a \u201ccrew assessment\u201d form used to grade cabin crew on their performance. It features seven grades for compliance with safety routines and 13 for boosting sales, including whether all passengers were offered smokeless cigarettes. The crew member\u2019s testimony backs up evidence that staff have been warned low sales could result in disciplinary proceedings, including having their hours changed. Ryanair said in a statement: \u201cOur statement of 23 November makes perfectly clear that we do not set \u2018targets\u2019. We do monitor performance, and any crew members that consistently and markedly underperform are given time and training to improve. This is called management. Again, we ask what does the Guardian do with its underperformers?\u201d The sale of food, drink, perfume and other items such as scratchcards is a major part of Ryanair\u2019s income, providing \u00a31.5bn in \u201cancillary revenue\u201d last year. That figure made up 27% of the airline\u2019s total revenue, and it said last year that it wanted to raise the proportion to 30%. Ryanair\u2019s employment practices have come under increasing scrutiny of late amid a row with pilots after mass cancellations caused by the company\u2019s failure to roster its staff properly. Pilots formed an unofficial trade union in a battle with the chief executive, Michael O\u2019Leary, over their employment terms. Ryanair pilots are being investigated by HM Revenue &amp; Customs over complex employment structures imposed on them by the no-frills airline. Crewlink declined to comment. \u2022 This article was amended on 4 December 2017 to add a statement from Ryanair",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Ministers are expected to back the first generation of small nuclear power stations in Britain with tens of millions of pounds this week, in an attempt to give the UK a competitive edge on the technology and provide a new source of clean power. Rolls-Royce and a host of US and Chinese companies have been lobbying and waiting for the support since George Osborne first promised them a share of \u00a3250m two years ago. Now, after industry frustration at huge delays to the government\u2019s competition to find the best value \u201csmall modular reactor\u201d (SMR), funding to develop and test the power stations will be confirmed. The energy minister, Richard Harrington, is expected to announce support for the embryonic technology on Thursday, industry figures told the Guardian. The funding is likely to be up to \u00a3100m, one source said. Small modular reactors provide about a tenth of the power of a conventional large nuclear power station, such as the one EDF is building at Hinkley Point C in Somerset. But their backers pitch them as a cheaper and quicker way to generate the new, low-carbon power the UK needs. Rolls-Royce has been publicly and privately lobbying the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) over its SMR design, which it positions as an industrial opportunity for Britain that would generate thousands of UK jobs. The firm argues that with electric cars likely to drive up future energy demand, the reactors will become a vital part of national infrastructure. The BEIS announcement is long overdue, as Harrington admitted at an industry conference in June. Several sources told the Guardian that the industry had been angered by government vacillation on whether to throw its weight behind the technology. \u201cThey have blown a bit hot and cold on SMRs. There\u2019s a sense that if we\u2019re going to be part of this, we need to get on with it quite quickly,\u201d said one. Another source said: \u201cThe way this has dragged on has hacked off the better ones [SMR developers].\u201d They added that while the funding was welcome, it was expected to be a relatively small sum and they were unsure it would be enough to make a difference. \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty half-hearted, incredibly British, not-quite-good-enough approach,\u201d they said. The funding is designed to help Rolls and other consortia, including the US companies NuScale and Terrapower and the controversial Chinese firm CNNC, undertake the research and development for a small nuclear power station to be built in the UK. It is not yet clear who will win a share of public funds, or how the pot will be carved up between the 33 participants in the SMR competition. Government officials have repeatedly made it clear that developers will only get financial help if they can prove their SMR will be affordable and competitive with rival energy sources. The earliest an SMR is thought likely to be ready for deployment in the UK is around 2030. One union said the technology warranted the government\u2019s backing. Justin Bowden, the GMB national secretary for energy, said: \u201cNuclear new build is absolutely vital as part of a balanced energy mix that is safe, secure and reliable. \u201cSMRs should form part of that. Depending on who may or may not go on to build them, there is an obvious benefit in terms of UK infrastructure jobs and an economic boost.\u201d The former energy secretary Lord Howell gave his backing to the reactors at a recent House of Lords event, where advocates and critics debated the technology. \u201cThe obvious way forward is through the sequential construction of a new series of smaller modular reactors of the kind now being developed by Rolls-Royce in the UK, and also in China and in America,\u201d said Howell. However, energy experts said the case for SMRs was far from proved, especially given the falling cost of alternatives such as offshore windfarms. Paul Dorfman, a research fellow at University College London, said: \u201cThe real question the government must ask is this: given the ongoing steep reduction in all renewable energy costs, and since SMR research and development is still very much ongoing, by the time SMRs comes to market, can they ever be cost competitive with renewable energy? The simple answer to that is a resounding no.\u201d An energy industry source also questioned how credible most of the SMR developers were. \u201cAlmost none of them have got more than a back of a fag packet design drawn with a felt tip,\u201d the source said. A BEIS spokesperson said: \u201cWe are currently considering next steps for the SMR programme and will communicate these in due course.\u201d \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

But their backers pitch them as a cheaper and quicker way to generate the new, low-carbon power the UK needs.</p> <p>Rolls-Royce has been publicly and privately lobbying the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) over its SMR design, which it positions as an industrial opportunity for Britain that would generate thousands of UK jobs. </p> <p>The firm argues that with electric cars likely to drive up future energy demand, the reactors will become a vital part of national infrastructure.</p> <p>The BEIS announcement is long overdue, as Harrington admitted at an industry conference in June.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2017/12/archive-zip/giv-3902xP2lRC1GyQOG/\" data-alt=\"Inside a small nuclear reactor - graphic\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2017/12/archive-zip/giv-3902xP2lRC1GyQOG/\">Inside a small nuclear reactor - graphic</a> </figure>  <p>Several sources told the Guardian that the industry had been angered by government vacillation on whether to throw its weight behind the technology. </p> <p>\u201cThey have blown a bit hot and cold on SMRs. There\u2019s a sense that if we\u2019re going to be part of this, we need to get on with it quite quickly,\u201d said one.</p> <p>Another source said: \u201cThe way this has dragged on has hacked off the better ones [SMR developers].\u201d They added that while the funding was welcome, it was expected to be a relatively small sum and they were unsure it would be enough to make a difference.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a pretty half-hearted, incredibly British, not-quite-good-enough approach,\u201d they said.</p> <p>The funding is designed to help Rolls and other consortia, including the US companies NuScale and Terrapower and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/07/chinese-firm-with-military-ties-invited-to-bid-for-role-in-uks-nuclear-future\">controversial Chinese firm CNNC</a>, undertake the research and development for a small nuclear power station to be built in the UK. It is not yet clear who will win a share of public funds, or how the pot will be carved up between the 33 participants in the SMR competition.</p> <p>Government officials have repeatedly made it clear that developers will only get financial help if they can prove their SMR will be affordable and competitive with rival energy sources. The earliest an SMR is thought likely to be ready for deployment in the UK is around 2030. </p> <p>One union said the technology warranted the government\u2019s backing. Justin Bowden, the GMB national secretary for energy, said: \u201cNuclear new build is absolutely vital as part of a balanced energy mix that is safe, secure and reliable.</p> <p>\u201cSMRs should form part of that. Depending on who may or may not go on to build them, there is an obvious benefit in terms of UK infrastructure jobs and an economic boost.\u201d</p> <p>The former energy secretary Lord Howell gave his backing to the reactors at a recent House of Lords event, where advocates and critics debated the technology.</p> <p>\u201cThe obvious way forward is through the sequential construction of a new series of smaller modular reactors of the kind now being developed by Rolls-Royce in the UK, and also in China and in America,\u201d said Howell.</p> <p>However, energy experts said the case for SMRs was far from proved, especially given the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/sep/11/huge-boost-renewable-power-offshore-windfarm-costs-fall-record-low\">falling cost of alternatives such as offshore windfarms</a>.</p> <p>Paul Dorfman, a research fellow at University College London, said: \u201cThe real question the government must ask is this: given the ongoing steep reduction in all renewable energy costs, and since SMR research and development is still very much ongoing, by the time SMRs comes to market, can they ever be cost competitive with renewable energy? The simple answer to that is a resounding no.\u201d</p> <p>An energy industry source also questioned how credible most of the SMR developers were. \u201cAlmost none of them have got more than a back of a fag packet design drawn with a felt tip,\u201d the source said.</p> <p>A BEIS spokesperson said: \u201cWe are currently considering next steps for the SMR programme and will communicate these in due course.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BusinessDesk\">@BusinessDesk</a>, or sign up to the daily Business Today email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2017/may/16/guardian-business-today-sign-up-financial-news-email?CMP=business_footnote\">here</a>.</p>",

Politically, the chancellor was constrained by the knowledge that the minority of deranged Brexiters who seem to be running this government were out for his blood. However, he managed, with limited room for manoeuvre, to ward off the hyenas for the time being. Why, the prime minister \u2013 who had earlier contemplated sacking him \u2013 even turned up for the Treasury\u2019s post-budget drinks. One of those out for his blood, a certain Michael Gove, is on record as not believing in expertise \u2013 except, presumably, his own. Gove was not one of the Brexiters who publicly urged the chancellor to massage the official forecasts to produce a favourable outcome for Brexit: that dubious honour lies with John Redwood and Jacob Rees-Mogg. However, I expect that, privately, Gove was with them in spirit \u2013 or perhaps devilry. At all events, Gove evidently conspired with the egregious Boris Johnson to tell Theresa May to fire the non-believers in her cabinet, and strengthen the cabal that wants to crash out of the EU and pursue a low-tax, minimum-regulation programme that could make the present austerity policy look like a vicarage tea party. Meanwhile, people should not be deceived by reports of possible breakthroughs in our negotiations with the other 27 members of the EU \u2013 a union in which I, and a growing number of the public I meet, hope we shall remain. The fact is that it is still the policy of this supine government to abandon our privileged position within the customs union and the single market, and take a leap in the dark. One sometimes wonders: do the extreme Brexiters, and their fellow travellers, ever ask themselves, as most ordinary citizens do from an early age, about the company they keep? Has it not occurred to them that our friends overseas think that, by heading for Brexit, Britain seems to be having a collective nervous breakdown? Have they not noticed that our enemies thoroughly approve of Brexit? Messrs Gove and Johnson presumably paid attention occasionally to their history teachers. They must be aware of the British tradition of trying to maintain the balance of power in Europe. Quite apart from the economic considerations, can they sleep at night when considering that President Putin sees Brexit as a full-frontal attack on Nato and the cohesion of Europe? And what about my old friend David Davis? His resistance to full disclosure of the government\u2019s honest assessment of the economic consequences of Brexit sits ill with his decades-long campaign for more open government. As the economic damage of even the prospect of Brexit becomes more apparent by the week, does Davis ever look back to the wise words he uttered in the Commons on 26 November 2002? \u201cReferendums should be held when the electorate are in the best possible position to make a judgment. They should be held when people can view all the arguments for and against and when those arguments have been rigorously tested. In short, referendums should be held when people know exactly what they are getting \u2026 we should not ask people to vote on a blank sheet of paper and tell them to trust us to fill in the details afterwards.\u201d He added: \u201cReferendums need to be treated as an addition to the parliamentary process, not as a substitute for it.\u201d As Observer reader David Crawford wrote last week: the referendum ballot paper \u201cmade no mention of the single market\u201d and the guidance, probably not read by most people, merely warned of the risks of losing \u201cfull\u201d access to the single market, not of crashing out altogether. The government is trying to make the best of a bad job by recognising the need for an industrial strategy \u2013 anathema to Mrs Thatcher\u2019s governments \u2013 with the emphasis on the advanced technology in which it believes the UK has a comparative advantage. But as the veteran British industrialist Tom Brown points out in his book Tragedy and Challenge, an enthralling account of Britain\u2019s industrial decline, the best market for our advanced exports is the EU, from which the Brexiters wish to depart, not the distant, and much smaller, markets on which they waste their fantasies. Brown\u2019s book constitutes a stark reminder of how successive governments have wasted so much time in the search for the Holy Grail. After monetarism and the ERM, they saw salvation in the pursuit of inflation targets. In a seminal lecture last week on the mishandling of our relationship with the rest of the EU by both Tony Blair and David Cameron, Sir Ivan Rogers, formerly our ambassador to the EU, noted the connection between that obsession with inflation and the referendum disaster. In his previous capacity as principal private secretary to the prime minister, Rogers witnessed what proved to be a fatal misjudgment. While other countries were phasing in entry from eastern Europe into their labour forces, Tony Blair was urged by Bank of England governor Mervyn King \u201cto open the labour market without transition on the grounds that it would help lower wage growth and inflation\u201d.
