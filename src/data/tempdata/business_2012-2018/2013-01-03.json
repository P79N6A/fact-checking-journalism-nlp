      "bodyText": "A warning from the International Monetary Fund that the US lacks a long-term strategy for dealing with its budget problems dampened the euphoric mood on global stock markets on Thursday. The Washington-based Fund's view that it considered the 11th-hour deal to prevent US economy from plunging over the fiscal cliff little more than a short-term fix was followed by release of minutes from a meeting of the Federal Reserve's policy-making committee showing members split over its programme of buying bonds to inject money into the economy. The bond-buying, known as quantitative easing, has also been adopted by the Bank of England. After release of the minutes, share prices lost ground in New York, the Dow Jones industrial average closing 0.2% down. London's FTSE 100 index consolidated above the 6,000 level, rising 20 points to close at 6047.34, a fresh 17-month high. The rise in London came despite a survey showing British construction output contracted at its fastest rate in six months in December, driven by a steep reduction in house building. Bond prices continued to fall after the deal between Democrats and Republicans in Congress to make permanent the tax cuts announced by George Bush and to postpone discussions on spending cuts and raising the US debt ceiling for two months. The interest rate (yield) on US 10-year bonds traded at up to 1.87%, the highest since September, while 10-year gilt yields in the UK edged above 2%. The IMF, which feared that the US could drag the global economy back into recession without a budget deal, said: \"We welcome the action by the US Congress to avoid sudden tax increases and spending cuts, including through an extension of unemployment benefits during 2013. In the absence of congressional action the economic recovery would have been derailed.\" The IMF mirrored the view of the credit rating agency Standard &amp; Poor's and many financial analysts, however, in stressing that the accord, reached late on New Year's Eve, was merely a stopgap. \"More remains to be done to put US public finances back on a sustainable path without harming the still fragile recovery,\" the IMF said. \"Specifically, a comprehensive plan that ensures both higher revenues and containment of entitlement spending over the medium term should be approved as soon as possible. In addition, it is crucial to raise the debt ceiling expeditiously and remove remaining uncertainties about the spending sequester and expiring appropriation bills.\" The sequester (steep federal spending cuts) was put off for two months and a number of appropriation bills, which authorise government purchasing, are due to expire then. Ian Kernohan, economist at RLAM, said: \"So far so good, although there is much unfinished business, in the shape of spending cuts and debt ceiling issues, not to mention the much bigger question about how a relatively low-tax economy like the US can meet its long-term spending commitments in the face of an ageing population. Given the polarised nature of US politics at the moment, trying to sort all this out will be an uphill task.\" S&amp;P, which stripped the US of its AAA rating in 2011, said: \"While Congressional compromise designed to avoid the 'fiscal cliff' may support the still-fragile US economic rebound, the compromise doesn't affect our view of the country's credit outlook, given that we believe yesterday's agreement does little to place the US's medium-term public finances on a more sustainable footing. \"In our view, the fiscal cliff has always been more of a slope \u2013 one that the country, in many ways, has been on for some time, with businesses curbing investments and financial markets advancing and retreating in reaction to news both good and bad. We maintain our forecast for US GDP growth of 2.2% this year, climbing to 2.7% in 2014.\" Confused by the fiscal cliff? Can't quite get a grip on the trillions involved or the deal thrashed out in Washington on New Year's Eve? A simple guide to the financial problems of the US circulating in the City reduces the vast number of zeroes involved to a simple household budget. This is it: \"Fiscal cliff put in a much better perspective: 'US tax revenue: $2,170,000,000,000 Federal budget: $3,820,000,000,000 New debt: $1,650,000,000,000 National debt: $14,271,000,000,000 Recent budget cuts: $38,500,000,000 Let's now remove eight zeros and pretend it is a household budget: Annual family income: $21,700 Money the family spent: $38,200 New debt on the credit card: $16,500 Outstanding credit card balance: $142,710 Total household budget cuts so far: $38.50 Got it?\"'",

In recent times the yield has moved in a range of 1.7% to 2%. Not everyone agrees, however. Samuel Tombs at Capital Economics said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Building hopes of global economic recovery, the deterioration in the UK\u2019s inflation outlook and growing fiscal worries have combined to push 10-year gilt yields above 2% today for the first time since May. Nonetheless, there remain good reasons to think that yields will struggle to rise further.</p> <p>For a start, with bank rate set to remain on hold for the foreseeable future, there is a limit to how far yields can rise. In addition, US politicians have reached only a partial agreement [on the fiscal cliff]. Another flash point is just two months away.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the deterioration in the inflation outlook has largely reflected the influence of higher commodity prices. There is little evidence to suggest that the UK has a domestically-generated inflation problem. So, assuming no further rise in commodity prices, we think that inflation will eventually undershoot markets\u2019 current expectations, prompting a renewed fall in break-even rates.&#xa0;</p> <p>The odds also still seem to be in favour of more QE being announced.&#xa0;</p> <p>Finally, we doubt that the UK\u2019s status as a relative safe-haven is under serious threat.

      "bodyText": "European markets have closed, and in slightly mixed fashion after Wednesday's fiscal-cliff inspired rallies. \u2022 The FTSE 100 recovered from an early dip to end 19.97 points higher at 6047.34 \u2022 Germany's Dax is down 0.23% \u2022 France's Cac closed 0.34% lower \u2022 Italy's FTSE MIB finished up 0.1% \u2022 Spain's Ibex ended down 0.52% \u2022 The Athens market added 1.17% \u2022 In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up just 7 points but it had added more than 470 points in the last two trading sessions. And with that, it's time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we'll be back tomorrow. Following the better than expected US jobs data, and the continuing market rally after the fiscal cliff agreement, UK gilts are under pressure. Yields on the ten year gilt have moved above 2% for the first time since May last year, with some analysts expecting further rises to around 2.2%. In recent times the yield has moved in a range of 1.7% to 2%. Not everyone agrees, however. Samuel Tombs at Capital Economics said: Building hopes of global economic recovery, the deterioration in the UK\u2019s inflation outlook and growing fiscal worries have combined to push 10-year gilt yields above 2% today for the first time since May. Nonetheless, there remain good reasons to think that yields will struggle to rise further. For a start, with bank rate set to remain on hold for the foreseeable future, there is a limit to how far yields can rise. In addition, US politicians have reached only a partial agreement [on the fiscal cliff]. Another flash point is just two months away. Meanwhile, the deterioration in the inflation outlook has largely reflected the influence of higher commodity prices. There is little evidence to suggest that the UK has a domestically-generated inflation problem. So, assuming no further rise in commodity prices, we think that inflation will eventually undershoot markets\u2019 current expectations, prompting a renewed fall in break-even rates. The odds also still seem to be in favour of more QE being announced. Finally, we doubt that the UK\u2019s status as a relative safe-haven is under serious threat. The loss of the triple-A rating in the US in August 2011 did not prevent yields from falling thereafter. So, if concerns about sovereign default and exit in the euro-zone build again, gilts still seem well-placed to benefit from renewed safe-haven demand. We still see scope for yields to fall and think that 10-year yields could return to their record low of 1.5%. For those still uncertain about the US fiscal cliff, here's an explanation which is doing the rounds in the City. Ireland is on its way to no longer relying on the troika - the EU, IMF and ECB - to keep its public finances going, one of the country's minister has said. But Richard Bruton, the republic's minister for jobs, enterprise and innovation, would not predict if the country could regain full economic sovereignty by the end of 2013. Henry McDonald in Dublin writes: As Ireland takes over the EU presidency role, Bruton expressed confidence that the republic would receive European financial assistance relating to the country's \u20ac30bn bill on IOU's to creditors and depositors of the now defunct Anglo Irish Bank. The Irish government and in particular Taoiseach Enda Kenny have consistently claimed that fellow EU states notably the Germans have promised funds to reduce the costs of repaying the so-called Anglo \u201cpromissory notes.\u201d Much of the Fine Gael-Labour coalition's economic credibility in the next 12 months rests on obtaining a rescue deal from the EU on that banking debt. On the issue of restoring full economic sovereignty and the possible departure of the troika, the minister said: \u201cClearly Ireland has hit every financial target that it has been set and that happened even in an environment of growth under-performing. We have delivered the change but clearly the key to our recovery is to rebuild based on an exporting franchise. \u201cIreland is already in a transitionary process towards moving away from dependance on the Troika. We have already started re-entering the markets in a small way....We are not going to be putting down dates or artificial deadlines. Our record speaks for itself as we have hit every marker on the way and we are determined to do that. \u201c The French government's 75% tax rate on incomes over \u20ac1m may have been knocked back by a constitutional court, but president Francois Hollande wants to reintroduce it next year, addressing some of the objections. The tax prompted the likes of actor G\u00e9rard Depardieu to quit the country and - in his case - receive Russian citizenship from president Putin. According to Bloomberg: Hollande told a cabinet meeting today that he wants the tax in next year\u2019s budget, though the exact adjustments and how many years it will last haven\u2019t been decided, government spokeswoman Najat Vallaud-Belkacem said in a press conference. The surcharge on incomes over \u20ac1m, one of Hollande\u2019s campaign promises, was rejected by the country\u2019s top judges on 29 December because it applied to individuals and not households. As a result, two households with the same total income could end up paying different rates, contravening equal-tax treatment, the Paris-based court said. \u201cThe tax remains a part of the government\u2019s aim of reviving France with justice,\u201d Vallaud-Belkacem said. The better than expected US weekly jobless figures have had analysts rushing to revise their forecasts for tomorrow's non-farm payroll numbers, it would appear: US shares are taking a pause from their fiscal cliff rebound, with investors taking profits following record gains. The Dow Jones industrial average was 0.34% down at 13366, minutes after Thursday's opening bell. On Wednesday, the first day of trading of 2013, US shares enjoyed their best performance in more than a year. In the last two days of trading, the Dow Jones has gained over 400 points, and investors have now decided to consolidate their gains. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Index was down 0.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite Index fell 0.16%. And with that it's time to hand over to my colleague Nick Fletcher. The Economist has tweeted a preview of the front cover of its next edition, reproduced here for your amusement. Signs of recovery in the Irish jobs market, with locally owned firms in the Republic on their biggest hiring spree since the Celtic Tiger boom peaked in 2006. The Guardian's Henry McDonald reports from Dublin: Some New Year chinks of economic light from Ireland today with jobs growth in its indigenous business sector. Enterprise Ireland has announced a net gain of 3,804 jobs in locally owned firms over 2012. Ireland's Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation Richard Bruton alongside Enterprise Ireland CEO Frank Ryan made the announcement in Dublin today that this was the highest net gain for Irish companies since 2006 - the year regarded as the height of the Celtic Tiger boom. Ryan cited the example of Kerry Group food manufacturer's expansion last year with the creation of new 900 jobs in Nass, Co.Kildare as a \"game changer\" for global food production. He pointed out that this was the largest ever investment in research and development by an Irish company. In the face of the domestic recession and the eurozone crisis, the Irish indigenous sector had proved to be \"resilient and relentless in pursuit of new market opportunities\", Ryan said. Irish companies support more than 300,000 jobs in the Irish economy and constitute 15 per cent of the Republic's total workforce. However, amid all the congratulations over a net rise in jobs one sobering thought - the 15 per cent figure representing Irish-owned generated employment is almost exactly the same proportion of the overall workforce still on the dole. At the end of 2012 Irish unemployment was still stuck at a stubborn 14.6 per cent with domestic demand still in the doldrums and the indigenous construction industry amongst the weakest sectors of the economy. UK investors have taken heart from news that more jobs were created in the US in December than forecast. Having spent most of the morning in negative territory, the FTSE 100 index rose 0.1% to 6033 after data from showing American private sector employers added 215,000 jobs in December, according to figures from Automatic Data Processing. The total was well above the 133,000 forecast in a Reuters poll of economists, and beat the 118,000 jobs created in November. The jobs market boost appears to contradict a reported increase in the numbers claiming unemployment benefit in the US. The Labor Department said Thursday initial claims for state benefits increased by 10,000 to 372,000 last week. However, the holidays mean data for 19 states had to be estimated and the figures are likely to be revised. Greek media reports suggest financial crime investigators are closing the net on tax evaders named in the infamous Lagarde list. A number of Greeks holding accounts at a Geneva branch of HSBC are suspected of major tax evasion by the Financial Tax Squad (SDOE), sources told daily newspaper Kathimerini. The paper says \"a large number of the 2,062 Greeks\" figuring on the Lagarde list \"are unable to justify their deposits as legally earned income\". The amount of tax outstanding is forecast to reach dozens of millions of euros with a number of culprits facing charges once inquiries conclude. The Lagarde list is a spreadsheet naming potential tax evaders with undeclared accounts at Swiss HSBC bank's Geneva branch. Former French finance minister Christine Lagarde passed it on to Greek officials in October 2010. Citing ANT1 TV, news website Keep Talking Greece says other checks on a list of 54,000 Greeks who transferred money abroad during the crisis years from 2009 to 2011 have shown that in 1,400 cases there is a big gap between the amounts transferred and the tax declarations. Inspectors have reportedly found a 7 billion euro discrepancy. Mortgage lenders are loosening the purse strings, with my colleague Jo Moulds reporting that a record number of lenders increasing secured credit to householders according. The Bank of England's credit conditions survey, published Thursday, showed the number of lenders saying they increased credit availability rose by 26.2% in the three months to mid December, with many citing the government's Funding for Lending Scheme as a driver. The FLS scheme offers cheap loans from the BoE to lenders who in turn extend credit to housebuyers and businesses. The increase was the highest since records began in 2007, and looks set to continue into the new year with 24.7% of lenders saying they expect credit availability to rise. December's rise was even higher than in the previous quarter, which was already the highest on record. For the first time, the survey showed an improvement in the availability of credit to the corporate sector too, with 29% of lender reporting an increase in credit availability for businesses. David Tinsley, a UK economist at BNP Paribas bank said: The latest Bank of England Credit Conditions Survey provides further room for optimism that the Funding for Lending Scheme (FLS), along with a general reduction in market tensions, is facilitating an improvement in the availability of lending. According the Guardian's industrial editor Dan Milmo, demand for Italian fast cars has slumped. He writes: Italy\u2019s love affair with fast cars has become the latest victim of the eurozone crunch after figures revealed that domestic sales of the Ferrari and Maserati had more than halved. Ferrari sales slipped by 56% to 248 units in 2012, according to the Italian auto industry trade body, with Maserati slumping by 72% to 115 units. Lamborghini fared a little better, with the 60 cars it sold last year representing a decline of 16.6%. Alfa Romeo sales slipped by more than a quarter to 42,000 units. A slump in house building has forced UK construction into its steepest decline in six months. The Markit/CPS construction purchasing managers index for December fell to 48.7 last month from 49.3 in November, well below the 50 level that separates growth from contraction. The index is at its lowest since June, when poor weather and extra public holidays dented output. Residential building sank faster than at any time since December 2010, when snow caused disruption. Markit senior economist Tim Moore said: December rounded off a miserable year for the UK construction sector. Survey respondents are also relatively subdued about the 2013 outlook amid reports from their clients that budgets will be under even greater pressure over the year ahead. Unemployment in Spain fell for the first time in five months in December, bringing some cheer to an economy suffering its second recession in three years. As service industries hired staff for the holiday season, the number of people registering for unemployment benefits fell by 59,094 from November to 4.8 million, the Labour Ministry in Madrid has announced. The number of service sector workers registered as jobless fell by 49,438, but this was offset by more construction and manufacturing workers registering as unemployed. The result is the best on record for the month of December. martin Van Vliet, an economist at ING Bank in Amsterdam, said: This is quite unique for a December. The recession could end in the second hallf but I'm not holding my breath. With the sheer scale of fiscal tightening in the pipeline I'm still a bit cautious. However, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development predicts unemployment in Spain, already the highest in the European Union, reaching 27% this year. The average cost of a UK home slipped a modest 0.1% in December, says Nationwide Building Society. Prices are down 1% from a year ago, and are likely to remain \"flat or modestly lower\", the lender's chief economist Robert Gardner cautioned. The outlook remains uncertain. With the economic recovery expected to remain fairly weak, the housing market is likely to be characterized by low levels of activity again in 2013, with prices remaining flat or modestly lower. Overall in the fourth quarter, house prices rose 0.5% compared with the previous three months and were down 1.1% compared with a year earlier. Of the 13 UK regions tracked by Nationwide, 11 had annual price declines during 2012. London was the best performing area, with a 0.7% gain in December, while Northern Ireland suffered the biggest decline with an 8.2% drop. House prices are about 5.1 times average earnings, above the long-term norm of 4.2, the lender found. Gardner said: Given that the U.K. economy was in recession for much of 2012, a 1 percent decline in house prices may be seen as a relatively resilient performance,\u201d Gardner said. However, \u201cconditions remain fragile, especially since other signs of housing-market activity, such as the number of mortgage approvals, remained subdued. U.K. house prices declined last month and may fall \u201cmodestly\u201d over 2013 because of a weak economic recovery, Nationwide Building Society said. The outlook remains uncertain. With the economic recovery expected to remain fairly weak, the housing market is likely to be characterized by low levels of activity again in 2013, with prices remaining flat or modestly lower. The German unemployment figures are in, showing the number of people out of work rose of the night month running in December. However, the increase was significantly lower than forecast. Labour Office data showed the total out of work incresaed by 3000 to 2.942 million. The total had been expected to rise by 10,000, according to a Reuters poll of 23 economists. The rise was also lower than in November, when an extra 5,000 people were reported to be unemployed. 9:30 UK construction PMI for December 9:30 Bank of England Credit Conditions survey for Q4 12:30 US challenger job cuts for December 13:30 US initial jobless claims, Decmeber 29 13:30 US continuing claims, December 22 Yesterday's euphoria, which sent London shares smashing through the 6000 level for the first time in 18 months, has abated with the FTSE 100 edging down after the opening bell. Blue chip shares fell 0.07% to 6023 at 3.30am, as relief over the US Congress deal to avoid the fiscal cliff was replaced by concerns about bigger political battles ahead. President Barack Obama last night signed the temporary settlement which puts off deep national spending cuts for a further two months, but Washington politicians must now hammer out a deal to raise the national debt ceiling and set a new budget. The ratings agencies joined the International Monetary Fund Wednesday in sounding a note of caution about the fiscal deal. Steven Hess of Moody's sovereign risk group said in a statement that the package passed in Washington: does not...provide a basis for a meaningful improvement in the government's debt ratios over the medium term. The rating agency expects that further fiscal measures are likely to be taken in coming months that would result in lower future budget deficits, which are necessary if the negative outlook on the government's bond rating is to be returned to stable. Notably, yesterday's package does not address the federal government's statutory debt limit, which was reached on December 31. The need to raise the debt limit may affect the outcome of future budget negotiations. Standard &amp; Poor's, which in 2011 lowered its long-term rating on US federal debt from AAA to AA+, released its verdict Wednesday night, saying the eleventh hour deal was not enough. While Congressional compromise designed to avoid the \"fiscal cliff\" may support the still-fragile U.S. economic rebound, the compromise doesn't affect our view of the country's credit outlook, given that we believe yesterday's agreement does little to place the U.S.'s medium-term public finances on a more sustainable footing. The agency has however reduced its assessment of the risk of another recession in the next year to 10%-15%, down from 15%-20%, with more weight placed on the lower end of the range. S&amp;P concludes: In our view, the fiscal cliff has always been more of a slope--one that the country, in many ways, has been on for some time, with businesses curbing investments and financial markets advancing and retreating in reaction to news both good and bad. We maintain our forecast for U.S. GDP growth of 2.2% this year, climbing to 2.7% in 2014. Good morning, and welcome to our coverage of the key events in the global economic crisis. After a new year's rally in European and US stock markets, the International Monetary Fund has moved to temper the euphoria. The global lender has welcomed the temporary deal to avoid the fiscal cliff but says \"more remains to be done\" to avoid derailing America's fragile economic recovery. \"We welcome the action by the US Congress to avoid sudden tax increases and spending cuts, including through an extension of unemployment benefits during 2013,\" the IMF said in a statement issued late Wednesday by spokesman Gerry Rice. \"In the absence of Congressional action the economic recovery would have been derailed.\" \"However, more remains to be done to put US public finances back on a sustainable path without harming the still fragile recovery,\" Rice added. \"Specifically, a comprehensive plan that ensures both higher revenues and containment of entitlement spending over the medium term should be approved as soon as possible. In addition, it is crucial to raise the debt ceiling expeditiously and remove remaining uncertainties about the spending sequester and expiring appropriation bills.\u201d The sequester (steep federal spending cuts) were put off for two months and a number of appropriation bills, which authorise government purchasing, are due to expire.",

      "bodyText": "Retailers enjoying a boost from rising online sales in December may suffer a hit in January as shoppers return unwanted goods. Up to 40% of clothing and between 5% and 10% of electrical goods and homewares bought via the internet or catalogues are returned to stores by shoppers who change their mind. Simon Irwin, an analyst at Credit Suisse, says: \"Product returns no doubt have a small part to play in why December has been consistently stronger for retailers relative to the months after it.\" This boomerang effect has always been an issue for specialists such as N Brown, Shop Direct, which owns the Littlewoods brand, and Next, which has a long history of home shopping. Next tackles the problem by reporting its online sales excluding an anticipated level of returns, as unwanted goods are called. It also makes a profit provision for the impact.

With all the positive sentiment around, Imagination's shares jumped 31.7p to 439.7p.</p> <p>Overall, after a minor dip at the start of trading, the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> continued the rally inspired by the new year agreement to prevent the US falling off its fiscal cliff. The leading index finished 19.97 points higher at 6047.34, helped by better than expected jobs data from Germany, Spain and, ahead of Friday's non-farm payroll numbers, the US. Angus Campbell, head of market analysis at Capital Spreads, said:</p> <blockquote> Earlier it looked like the buyers had dried up but some decent employment data from the US lifted the FTSE 100 and other European indices from their lows. <br> Investors will tread carefully from here after such a big move to the upside especially when the outlook remains uncertain to say the least both in terms of the US fiscal problems and the eurozone debt crisis. In only a matter of weeks further fractious negotiations on spending cuts will take place in the US meaning more threats to the world's biggest economy.  Nonetheless, despite the headwinds and only a couple of sessions under our belts no sell off has ensued indicating that investors remain in a bullish mood. </blockquote> <p>There were contrasting fortunes for two of Britain's biggest support services companies. <strong>Serco</strong> - already lifted on Wednesday by a buy note from Liberum Capital - added another 9p to 550.5p. The catalyst this time was a positive update on the tagging and Docklands light railway from Espirito Santo. Analyst David Brockton said:</p> <blockquote> We see opportunity for Serco's shares to outperform in 2013. We expect modest improvement in organic growth and cash generation. We believe the renewal risk profile to forecasts is lower than that perceived by the market. <br> We believe the perception that 2013 is a big renewal year for Serco is no longer valid following several contract decisions through 2012: these included AWE (extended), National Physical Laboratory (lost) and Northern Rail (extended). Subject to clarification of fourth quarter wins at the final results, we would expect 2013 estimated revenue visibility to rise just above 90%, equivalent to prior years.  Finally, relative share price underperformance through 2012 has created a valuation discount to peers which we feel is unwarranted. We lift our fair value from 560p to 630p and upgrade our rating from neutral to buy. </blockquote> <p>But <strong>Compass</strong>, the catering specialist, closed 2.5p lower at 735p following Brockton cutting his recommendation:</p> <blockquote> Compass shares outperformed in 2012 (up 19% versus a 6% rise in the FTSE 100) and we now believe the rating encapsulates the near-term opportunity. Cyclical pressure in Europe will limit organic growth and impede earnings progression through 2013, despite accelerated efficiencies. The scope for using the group's balance sheet to accelerate earnings through share buy-back or acquisitions is also diminished, due to lower cash generation. While we increase our fair value from 700p to 750p, we downgrade our rating from buy to neutral. </blockquote> <p><strong>Next</strong> was the biggest riser in the leading index, up 101p to \u00a338.73 after the retailer reported a 3.9% rise in total sales in the run-up to Christmas. It also raised its full year profit guidance from \u00a3590m-\u00a3620m to \u00a3611m-\u00a3625m. In a hold note, Freddie George at Seymour Pierce said:</p> <blockquote> We believe the company was one of the winners over Christmas helped by a strong range geared to the colder weather. Next is a highly cash generative, tightly run and looks to continue to execute on the basics of giving the consumer great product and capitalising on its leading multi-channel position. However, the sector has performed strongly over the last year and sector rotation is likely to lead to a period of consolidation. </blockquote> <p>But <strong>WH Smith</strong> fell sharply for the second day running on nervousness about trading during the key Christmas period, down another 17.5p to 636p.</p> <p><strong>Experian</strong>, which runs credit checks for banks and retailers, rose 3p to \u00a310.15 on hopes of a boost from a return to lending in the US. A report suggested that Bank of America was increasing mortgage and corporate lending after two years of focusing on capital levels and cost cutting. Caroline de La Soujeole at Seymour Pierce said:</p> <blockquote> We believe this is noteworthy, showing returns to health in the US mortgage market. We believe mortgage related revenues account for around 10% of US credit bureau revenue whilst the latter represented around 20% of group sales in 2012. <br> The shares have underperformed the wider market by 6% in the past month and are now trading at what we view as more attractive levels. </blockquote> <p>The broker moved from reduce to add with an \u00a311 price target.</p> <p>But building materials companies <strong>CRH</strong>, down 17p to \u00a312.66, and <strong>Wolseley</strong>, 13p lower at \u00a329.95, were hit by concerns about their exposure to the US economy and forthcoming spending cuts, despite the tentative fiscal cliff agreement.</p> <p>Elsewhere <strong>Chemring</strong>, the defence group, climbed 15.3p to 253.6p after it announced the appointment of a new finance director, former Umeco executive Steve Bowers.

In total it expects around \u00a318m of restructuring charges for the full year, but said results overall would be in line with expectations. In a hold note, Peel Hunt said:</p> <blockquote> Menzies has issued an in-line 2012 pre-close update.

If you've got \u00a31m knocking about it won't buy you much more than a 875sq ft two-bedroom flat in Kensington . A five bedroom family home in W8 could easily set you back \u00a330m. Lawrence Hall of Zoopla said: \"The London property price rise has been driven by overseas buyers, mostly from Asia and Russia. London has a small amount of highly sought after property stock of what we might call trophy properties. It is these properties that are fuelling the boom.\" Robert Gardner, and economist at Nationwide, said the boom in super-luxury property in London had had a knock on effect in increasing prices of more modest properties across the country.",

      "bodyText": "Productivity in the private sector has dropped to its lowest level since 2005, as companies continue to employ new staff despite falling demand for goods and services. The data comes as a new report from the Bank of England suggests the weakness of Britain's recovery is due to a permanent fall in productivity as well as a shortage in demand. The output per hour of private-sector workers fell by almost 4% in the year to October 2012, according to data from the Office for National Statistics. Figures for the economy as a whole were not much better, with a 2.4% decline in productivity over the year. The figures take the sheen off supposedly buoyant employment statistics that showed companies continuing to create jobs throughout last year. Some companies have retained staff by forcing employees to accept pay freezes, or in some cases a cut in wages. But, as productivity declined, labour costs per unit of output rose by more than 3% over the year to October. John Philpott, director of independent consultancy The Jobs Economist, said workers' tolerance of pay restraint had probably reached its limit, so businesses would come under increasing financial pressure this year. He expected companies to try to boost productivity instead of shedding staff. \"The probability is that employers will look to squeeze more out of each hour by making workers work harder, rather than by cutting back on jobs, particularly if they think the economy is going to pick up,\" he said. Economists have been puzzled by the decline in productivity, particularly as it followed a financial crisis, which usually prompts a burst of productivity. Some say employers have been taking advantage of cheap labour rather than making investments in new technology that would improve productivity. Businesses have found it hard to invest in capital goods following the crisis as banks have been unwilling to lend. Paul Gregg, a labour market economist, said companies could be opting to hire more staff for extra shifts, and to delay purchases of new machinery. There are growing concerns that the decline in productivity could be long-lasting. Research published on Thursday, and co-authored by the Bank of England policymaker Martin Weale, suggested that more of the decline than previously thought would prove to be permanent. \"Both permanent labour productivity and temporary demand shocks now contribute roughly equal amounts to recent [2010 and 2011] weak output growth in the UK,\" it noted.",

      "bodyText": "All things considered, house prices proved remarkably resilient during 2012. The Nationwide building society has reported that prices fell by 1% during the year, but given that the UK suffered its first double-dip recession since the 1970s, the fall could have been a lot bigger. A number of factors explain why the cost of property stagnated. Rising employment, low mortgage rates and the leniency of lenders towards those in arrears meant there were few forced sellers. Supply of new homes has dried up, and that was the main reason why the latest snapshot of the construction sector from CIPS/Markit was weak. Moreover, the 1% drop reported by Nationwide masks big regional variations. An extra 47,000 property millionaires were created in Britain \u2013 most of them in London and the south-east, where the economy was much more buoyant last year than in the regions north of a line drawn from the Severn estuary to the Wash. Rents in and around London are high, which means demand for the limited pool of available property has remained robust. Even so, when adjusted for inflation prices fell by 4% last year and are 25% down on the peak reached in the third quarter of 2007. Since then, the average price of a home in the UK, adjusted for inflation, has dropped from \u00a3218,501 to \u00a3162,924 and, according to the Nationwide is some \u00a325,000 below its long-term trend. What is the outlook for 2013? The Bank of England's credit conditions survey suggests that more money for home loans is becoming available and at more competitive rates. Threadneedle Street always said it would take time for the Funding for Lending scheme, which offers lenders access to cheaper borrowing provided they pass the benefits on to their customers, to work after its introduction in August 2012, and so it has proved. The availability of finance has been an important factor in explaining the frozen state of the residential property market for the past two years, so it should be easier in 2013 for borrowers to get a mortgage. But perhaps not that much easier, at least not yet. Lending criteria for first-time buyers remain a lot tougher than they were in the boom years before the crash, requiring those potential buyers without financial support from their parents to save hefty amounts for deposits. An increase in the supply of mortgage credit is a necessary but not sufficient condition for a rise in property transactions. The willingness of consumers to take on more debt, the state of their finances, and the level of confidence about the future also matter. Here, there are reasons to expect any pick-up in transactions and prices to be modest and gentle because real incomes remain under pressure and households are still working off the debts built up in the previous economic cycle. Public spending cuts will hurt the northern regions more than those in the south. After the boom-bust at the end of the 1980s and early 1990s, it took house prices a decade to return to their long-term trend, and another lengthy period of adjustment looks likely now. The recovery in house prices from the mid-1990s onwards came at a time when the house price to average earnings ratio was below its long term average of 4. Despite coming down from a peak of 6.5 at the top of the boom, the ratio is still 5, and house prices will remain a stretch unless and until it falls further.",

      "body": "<p>All things considered, house prices proved remarkably resilient during 2012.&#xa0;The Nationwide building society has reported that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/2013/jan/02/house-prices-inch-up-november\" title=\"\">prices fell by 1% during the year,</a> but given that the UK suffered its first double-dip recession since the 1970s, the fall could have been a lot&#xa0;bigger.</p> <p>A number of factors explain why the cost of property stagnated. Rising employment, low mortgage rates and the leniency of lenders towards those in arrears meant there were few forced sellers. Supply of new homes has dried up, and that was the main reason why the latest snapshot of the construction sector from CIPS/Markit was weak.</p> <p>Moreover, the 1% drop reported by Nationwide masks big regional variations. An extra 47,000 property millionaires were created in Britain \u2013 most of them in London and the south-east, where the economy was much more buoyant last year than in the regions north of a line drawn from the Severn estuary to the Wash.</p> <p>Rents in and around London are high, which means demand for the limited pool of available property has remained&#xa0;robust.</p> <p>Even so, when adjusted for inflation prices fell by 4% last year and are 25% down on the peak reached in the third quarter of 2007. Since then, the average price of a home in the UK, adjusted for inflation, has dropped from \u00a3218,501 to \u00a3162,924 and, according to the Nationwide is some \u00a325,000 below its long-term trend.</p> <p>What is the outlook for 2013? The Bank of England's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2013/jan/03/more-mortgages-credit-bank-of-england\" title=\"\">credit conditions survey</a> suggests that more money for home loans is becoming available and at more competitive rates. Threadneedle Street always said it would take time for the Funding for Lending scheme, which offers lenders access to cheaper borrowing provided they pass the benefits on to their customers, to work after its introduction in August 2012, and so it has proved.</p> <p>The availability of finance has been an important factor in explaining the frozen state of the residential property market for the past two years, so it should be easier in 2013 for borrowers to get a mortgage. But perhaps not that much easier, at least not yet. Lending criteria for first-time buyers remain a lot tougher than they were in the boom years before the crash, requiring those potential buyers without financial support from their parents to save hefty amounts for deposits.</p> <p>An increase in the supply of mortgage&#xa0;credit is a necessary but not sufficient condition for a rise in property transactions. The willingness of consumers to take on more debt, the state of their finances, and the level of confidence about the future also matter. Here, there are reasons to expect any pick-up in transactions and prices to be modest and gentle because real incomes remain under pressure and households are still working off the debts built up in the previous economic cycle. Public spending cuts will hurt the northern regions more than those in the&#xa0;south.</p> <p>After the boom-bust at the end of the 1980s and early 1990s, it took house prices a decade to return to their long-term trend, and another lengthy period of adjustment looks likely now. The recovery in house prices from the mid-1990s onwards came at a time when the house price to average earnings ratio was below its long term average of 4. Despite coming down from a peak of 6.5 at the top of the boom, the ratio is still 5, and house prices will remain a stretch unless and until it falls further.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Home buyers should find it easier to get a mortgage this year, as banks increase the availability of loans, according to a report from the Bank of England. The credit conditions survey said banks intend to significantly increase mortgage lending over the next three months, helped by cheaper funding available under the Funding for Lending scheme. Banks are also seeking to boost market share and some are looking to take on more risk. The survey also showed a significant improvement in the availability of credit to companies. Economists largely welcomed the news, although they remained cautious about the outlook for the year. Vicky Redwood at Capital Economics said: \"We should not get too carried away. Whether banks actually follow through on these intentions to boost the supply of credit remains to be seen. What's more, even if banks make more credit available, firms and households may not want to borrow more. Although demand for household credit was reported to be improving, demand for corporate credit was expected to remain subdued.\" A net balance of 26% of lenders posted a rise in the availability of secured credit over the past three months. This was an even higher balance than in the third quarter of last year, which was already the highest since the survey began in 2007. The report noted that lenders had already expanded their mortgage books in the three months to mid-December, driven in part by the Funding for Lending scheme, which offers cut-price loans to banks and building societies who are expected to make the money available through mortgages to home buyers and loans to small businesses. As the availability of mortgages improved during the period, rates came down and are expected to decline further in the coming months. Lenders said this was partly due to cheaper funding, as well as growing competition from their rivals. Things are expected to improve for home movers with little equity in their property, as banks increase their maximum loan-to-value ratios. Already, at the end of last year, Nationwide launched a new range of 95% mortgages, provided borrowers commit to making regular savings for at least six months. As rates improved, demand for both home purchase and buy-to-let mortgages rose in the fourth quarter and lenders expect a further increase in the next three months. Overall lending to businesses grew significantly at the end of last year, with large and medium-sized companies the main beneficiaries. The availability of loans for small businesses, however, only increased slightly in the fourth quarter of last year and banks noted a decline in demand from these quarters. Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight said: \"There are signs that smaller companies may not benefit as much as larger and medium-sized firms, which would be disappointing given that it is a lack of available and affordable credit to smaller companies that has been of particular concern. The implication is that banks remain very cautious about lending to smaller businesses in the current difficult and uncertain environment.\" A growing number of companies, of all sizes, defaulted on their loans during the fourth quarter. The bank expects that trend to continue over the next three months.",

Sales of Ferraris, which can cost up to \u00a3250,000 for some models, slipped by 56% in 2012 when the company sold 248 cars in Italy, according to the country's auto industry trade body, with Maserati slumping by 72% to 115 vehicles.

      "body": "<p>Contrasting fortunes for two of Britain's biggest support services companies, as the overall market managed to hold onto much of Wednesday's impressive gains.</p> <p><strong>Serco</strong> - already lifted on Wednesday by a buy note from Liberum Capital - added another 7p to 548.5p. The catalyst this time was a positive update on the tagging and Docklands light railway from Espirito Santo. Analyst David Brockton said:</p> <blockquote> We see opportunity for Serco's shares to outperform in 2013. We expect modest improvement in organic growth and cash generation. We believe the renewal risk profile to forecasts is lower than that perceived by the market. <br> We believe the perception that 2013 is a big renewal year for Serco is no longer valid following several contract decisions through 2012: these included AWE (extended), National Physical Laboratory (lost) and Northern Rail (extended). Subject to clarification of fourth quarter wins at the final results, we would expect 2013 estimated revenue visibility to rise just above 90%, equivalent to prior years.  Finally, relative share price underperformance through 2012 has created a valuation discount to peers which we feel is unwarranted. We lift our fair value from 560p to 630p and upgrade our rating from neutral to buy. </blockquote> <p>But <strong>Compass</strong>, the catering specialist, has lost 11p to 726.5p following Espirito's Brockton cutting his recommendation:</p> <blockquote> Compass shares outperformed in 2012 (up 19% versus a 6% rise in the FTSE 100) and we now believe the rating encapsulates the near-term opportunity. Cyclical pressure in Europe will limit organic growth and impede earnings progression through 2013, despite accelerated efficiencies. The scope for using the group's balance sheet to accelerate earnings through share buy-back or acquisitions is also diminished, due to lower cash generation. While we increase our fair value from 700p to 750p, we downgrade our rating from buy to neutral. </blockquote> <p>Overall the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> is down just 9.36 points at 6018.01, not a bad performance after Wednesday's fiscal cliff-inspired surge.

      "bodyText": "Contrasting fortunes for two of Britain's biggest support services companies, as the overall market managed to hold onto much of Wednesday's impressive gains. Serco - already lifted on Wednesday by a buy note from Liberum Capital - added another 7p to 548.5p. The catalyst this time was a positive update on the tagging and Docklands light railway from Espirito Santo. Analyst David Brockton said: We see opportunity for Serco's shares to outperform in 2013. We expect modest improvement in organic growth and cash generation. We believe the renewal risk profile to forecasts is lower than that perceived by the market. We believe the perception that 2013 is a big renewal year for Serco is no longer valid following several contract decisions through 2012: these included AWE (extended), National Physical Laboratory (lost) and Northern Rail (extended). Subject to clarification of fourth quarter wins at the final results, we would expect 2013 estimated revenue visibility to rise just above 90%, equivalent to prior years. Finally, relative share price underperformance through 2012 has created a valuation discount to peers which we feel is unwarranted. We lift our fair value from 560p to 630p and upgrade our rating from neutral to buy. But Compass, the catering specialist, has lost 11p to 726.5p following Espirito's Brockton cutting his recommendation: Compass shares outperformed in 2012 (up 19% versus a 6% rise in the FTSE 100) and we now believe the rating encapsulates the near-term opportunity. Cyclical pressure in Europe will limit organic growth and impede earnings progression through 2013, despite accelerated efficiencies. The scope for using the group's balance sheet to accelerate earnings through share buy-back or acquisitions is also diminished, due to lower cash generation. While we increase our fair value from 700p to 750p, we downgrade our rating from buy to neutral. Overall the FTSE 100 is down just 9.36 points at 6018.01, not a bad performance after Wednesday's fiscal cliff-inspired surge. There was some positive economic news, with China's non-manufacturing PMI showing a bigger than expected rise and better than forecast German and Spanish unemployment figures.
