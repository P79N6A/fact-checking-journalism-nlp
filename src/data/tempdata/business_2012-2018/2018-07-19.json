      "bodyText": "If you are watching your weight but struggle to give up chocolate there may be some relief in view, because Cadbury is to launch a new version of its famous purple liveried Dairy Milk bars with 30% less sugar. The lower-sugar bar took a team of 20 scientists, nutritionists and chocolatiers almost two years to finesse, the company said. The recipe does not rely on artificial sweeteners, colours or preservatives but instead includes more fibre in place of some of the sugar. However, the confectionery giant is not risking the wrath of Dairy Milk aficionados and intends to sell the new bar alongside those made to the original recipe, even though it insists the diet versions taste as good. \u201cWe\u2019ve tested this with hundreds of consumers and they love it,\u201d said Glenn Caton, president of Northern Europe of Mondel\u0113z International, the US multinational company that bought Cadbury in 2010. \u201cIt\u2019s very tricky to reformulate chocolate because it\u2019s just cocoa, sugar and milk and if you take one thing out, it changes the structure,\u201d said Caton, who claimed he could barely taste the difference between the two bars. \u201cWe\u2019ve used fibre as an alternative to some of the sugar and found it doesn\u2019t have a negative impact on the taste or structure.\u201d The food industry is under growing pressure from the government to cut the sugar content of their products amid an obesity crisis that has made the UK the most overweight nation in western Europe. In April the sugar tax came into effect but before that deadline many drinks, including Irn-Bru, Sprite, Fanta and Dr Pepper had been reformulated to avoid the new tax or avoid its highest rates. Dairy Milk was launched by George Cadbury, a scion of the founding Quaker family, in Britain in 1905 and is the UK\u2019s biggest selling brand. However, despite rising levels of obesity, chocolate sales are actually in decline, due to major supermarkets moving confectionery away from their checkouts and alternative sugar hits provided by high street chains. Mondelez is also under competitive pressure from arch rival Nestl\u00e9, which claimed a world-first in March by restructuring the sugar it uses in its confectionery to produce a white chocolate bar with 30% less sugar than its usual Milkybar brand. Despite the drive to eliminate sugar, Caton said it would have been a controversial move to simply axe the current recipe. \u201cConsumers love original Cadbury Dairy Milk,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to offer this as a choice, not as a replacement to people who want to treat themselves. We think offering 30% less sugar [bars] is a more balanced approach than doing something controversial like taking Cadbury Dairy Milk away.\u201d In 2016, Public Health England (PHE) set a voluntary target for the industry to reduce the level of sugar in foods that contribute the most to children\u2019s calorie intake by a fifth by 2020. However, in May it emerged that manufacturers and retailers missed the first milestone of achieving a 5% cut in year one. \u201cWe\u2019re pleased that Mondelez is the latest household name to commit to offering healthier products,\u201d said Dr Alison Tedstone, the chief nutritionist at PHE. \u201cThis announcement shows reducing sugar in chocolate confectionary is possible and we look forward to seeing future reductions across more of its confectionary range.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Majority of investors reject pay deal for Royal Mail chief executive", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Royal Mail investors have staged one of the biggest pay revolts in UK corporate history, with nearly three-quarters refusing to support the remuneration package handed to its new chief executive. The postal service, privatised in a much-criticised process that began in 2013, handed Rico Back an annual deal worth up to \u00a32.7m if he hits bonus targets, on top of a \u00a36m \u201cgolden hello\u201d for leaving the company\u2019s European subsidiary. Trade union bosses labelled the payouts unbelievable, warning that postal workers would be angry at seeing such lavish awards handed out just months after they accepted changes in their pensions to help the company save money. Back, who is based in Switzerland and will commute from Zurich to London, will earn annual basic pay of \u00a3640,000, a 17% increase on predecessor Moya Greene. Royal Mail said this was to make up for a lower pension allowance, which will be \u00a3112,000 compared with Greene\u2019s \u00a3200,000, a sum the company admitted last year was too high. The company defended the arrangement by pointing to Back\u2019s strong performance leading Royal Mail\u2019s European subsidiary, GLS, but three-quarters of votes cast at its annual meeting in Sheffield failed to back his pay deal, while 70% actively opposed it. The revolt is thought to be the largest at a UK public company in at least a decade, outstripping the 64% who failed to back a \u00a375m payout for housebuilder Persimmon\u2019s chief executive in April, and the 60% who rejected former WPP boss Sir Martin Sorrell\u2019s \u00a37m deal in 2012. The shareholder vote is merely advisory and the company is under no obligation to change its pay arrangements. \u201cIt would appear that Rico Back has got \u00a36m moving from one job within the Royal Mail to another, a life-changing lottery win to anyone else, as well as an astronomical wage packet,\u201d said Terry Pullinger, deputy general secretary of the Communication Workers Union. \u201cThese things have drifted away from reality and it\u2019s got to the point where it\u2019s unbelievable money.\u201d He pointed to a lengthy dispute with the company over working hours, pay and pensions that ended in February, when 110,000 workers \u2013 who the CWU said were paid an average \u00a322,500 a year \u2013 accepted changes to their retirement benefits. \u201cThe business is constantly telling us that every pound is a prisoner and they\u2019re under the cosh and then you see this,\u201d he said. \u201cSo how can people believe the business is in difficult financial straits when that sort of money\u2019s being bandied about?\u201d \u201cShareholders probably just want a bigger return themselves, so for them to react like that, I\u2019d probably double that in terms of what our members would think.\u201d ISS and Glass Lewis, groups that advise City investors on how to cast their votes, had both urged shareholders to oppose the deal because of the increase in Back\u2019s basic pay. ISS had also raised a red flag over departure payouts for Greene, which include a full-year cash bonus of \u00a3774,000 and 12 months\u2019 salary, worth \u00a3547,500, after she leaves in September. Orna Ni-Chionna, chair of Royal Mail\u2019s remuneration committee, said: \u201cWe recognise and understand the reasons why our shareholders felt they could not vote in favour.\u201d She said Royal Mail had \u201calready been in contact with many of them and will reflect very carefully on their main concerns\u201d at an autumn review of the company\u2019s remuneration policy. But Royal Mail\u2019s chairman, Peter Long, who also chairs Countrywide and is vice-chairman of travel group Tui, defended Back\u2019s pay package, pointing to his record as boss of GLS. \u201cGLS has truly been a great success story for us,\u201d he said. \u201cWe bought it when we were the Post Office back in 1999. That is also when our new CEO, Rico Back, came on board. Since then, under Rico\u2019s dynamic and astute leadership, GLS has grown and grown.\u201d The company defended Greene\u2019s payoff, saying she was \u201can exceptional executive and we have made the right remuneration arrangements to reward the generation of shareholder value in the longer term and to honour our contractual obligations.\u201d Earlier this week, Royal Mail reported a 7% fall in letter revenues in the most recent three months, while UK parcel revenues rose 6%. Overall revenues in the UK division were down 1%, while overall group underlying revenues were up 2% thanks to an 11% surge in turnover at GLS, run by Back.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Profits at Sports Direct have plunged by nearly three-quarters after the retailer took an \u00a385m hit on its investment in Debenhams, the struggling department store chain. The sportswear retailer, founded by the billionaire Mike Ashley, said pre-tax profits fell 72.5% to \u00a378m in the year to 29 April, from \u00a3282m the previous year, reflecting the sharp drop in value of its near-30% stake in Debenhams. The decline was also partly the result of a one-off boost to profits in the previous year from the sale of Sports Direct\u2019s Dunlop business and shares in rival retailer JD Sports. Despite the fall in profits, the company revealed it was to pay out \u00a35m to Michael Murray, the partner of Ashley\u2019s daughter who advises the company on property transactions. It said the fee was based on the \u201cvalue created\u201d by Murray and covered his work over the three years to March. Murray has also been handed the role of \u201chead of elevation\u201d, leading Ashley\u2019s drive to move Sports Direct upmarket and become known as \u201cthe Selfridges of Sport\u201d. Sports Direct\u2019s finance director, John Kempster, said: \u201cThe group has always had a performance-related pay culture and this is very much in the same box.\u201d Shares in Sports Direct fell 7% after the statement, making the retailer one of the biggest fallers on the FTSE 250. Sports Direct\u2019s full-year results showed a 2% drop in UK sales \u2013 which make up nearly two-thirds of its business \u2013 to \u00a32.2bn and a slight dip in European sales. The rest of the world performed better and overall group revenues grew 3.5% to \u00a33.4bn. Kempster said the firm was \u201cvery happy with the results\u201d, adding: \u201cIn a tough market maintaining sales is OK.\u201d Kempster said Sports Direct had benefited from England\u2019s run in the World Cup as fans snapped up replica shirts. However, Kempster described the overall World Cup impact on trade as only \u201ca blip\u201d because the retailer was now an international business and included fashion chains such as Flannels and USC. Despite the financial blow from the Debenhams investment, Kempster said strategic punts on the shares of rival retailers were \u201cpart of our DNA\u201d. He said Sports Direct was talking to the ailing department store about initiatives that might help both retailers. However, Ashley reportedly told City retail analysts that he would be \u201csmashing into [Debenhams] about why they don\u2019t do anything Sports Direct suggests\u201d. .\u201dShares in Debenhams have tumbled 66% to 11.9p since the start of the year. The department store chain has issued three profit warnings since Christmas and came under fresh pressure this week when it emerged that credit insurers had reduced cover for suppliers to the company. In a further blow to Ashley on Thursday, shares in Goals Soccer Centres, a five-a-side football operator in which Sports Direct owns a 19% stake, slumped nearly 22%. The company issued a profits warning blaming the snowy, cold weather in March. Sports Direct said it was continuing to pay all staff, including casual workers, hourly rates above the national minimum wage, as well as commission and other rewards worth \u00a320m a year. The unusual statement followed a Guardian investigation in 2015 which found that temporary workers at Sports Direct were effectively receiving hourly rates of pay below the minimum wage. \u201cThere aren\u2019t many companies that feel the need to state compliance with the National Living Wage in their annual results \u2013 but then Sports Direct isn\u2019t renowned for diligently following corporate etiquette,\u201d said Laith Khalaf, a senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.",

Ex-Deutsche Bank trader Christian Bittar was part of a wider conspiracy to dishonestly manipulate Euribor lending rates. The 46-year-old played a leading role in the four-year fraud and his personal profit was estimated to be around \u00a32.5m. He was sentenced to five years and four months\u2019 imprisonment at Southwark crown court on Thursday after pleading guilty in March. Former Barclays trader Philippe Moryoussef, 50, was sentenced in his absence to eight years\u2019 imprisonment, having fled to his native France before being convicted at trial. Judge Michael Gledhill said Bittar was not motivated by \u201cgreed alone\u201d but also the \u201csatisfaction of being able to beat the system\u201d. He told the court that it was \u201cbeyond irony\u201d that Bittar, who earned nearly \u00a360m during the indictment period \u2013 most of it legitimately \u2013 needed to resort to dishonest manipulation. \u201cDerivatives trading is often said to be a form of betting,\u201d he said. \u201cYou took the analogy one step further, by loading the dice.\u201d He was regarded as a world-class trader who earned \u201cstaggering\u201d sums of up to \u00a347m a year, the judge said.

He said the sentence should \u201csend a clear message of deterrence to others working in the world of banking and finance that those convicted of dishonestly manipulating interest rates will face lengthy custodial sentences\u201d. Bittar and Moryoussef were both convicted of conspiracy to defraud between January 2005 and December 2009. Along with others, they manipulated the process used to set the rates in a bid to boost their employers\u2019 profits and their own pay and bonuses. Bittar\u2019s lawyer Alexander Cameron said he was described in character references as a man of \u201chumility, modesty, integrity, loyalty, charity\u201d and a \u201cdedicated\u201d father to his three children. \u201cHe will never again be able to work in the job at which he legitimately excelled,\u201d he added.

      "bodyText": "And finally, London\u2019s stock market got a small boost from the slump in the pound today. The FTSE 100 has just closed seven points higher at 7683, a gain of 0.1%. That\u2019s a pretty modest gain, but better than elsewhere today - the French and German markets both lost around 0.6%. Sterling is still weak, though, down 0.75 of a cent today at $1.2993, a ten-month low. The City is still concerned by the drop in retail sales last month. Fiona Cincotta of City Index explains why the data is a worry: Whilst hot weather can sometimes encourage consumers to hit the high street, June\u2019s heatwave, combined with the World Cup kept consumers away, resulting in non-food retailers suffering from reduced footfall. Today\u2019s results are part of a continuing trend. Retailers in general have been under intense pressure over the past 18 months as squeezed consumers hold back on spending in the face of higher prices and sluggish wage growth. Big names such as Marks and Spencer, Mothercare and House of Fraser have been closing stores in order to reduce costs. Meanwhile internet spending, continued to break news records. That\u2019s all for today. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW Over in America, the number of people filing new claims for unemployment benefit has hit its lowest level in almost half a century. The initial claims total fell by 8,000 last week to just 207,000, a level not seen since December 1969. Paul Ryan, the Republican House Speaker, has hailed the news: Donald Trump has belatedly spotted that Google has been fined (yesterday) by the European Commission for breaking competition rules in the mobile phone sector. The president reckons it vindicates his criticism of Europe (who he called a \u2018foe\u2019 last week). The International Monetary Fund has weighed in on Brexit, warning that both sides would lose out if Britain left the EU without a deal. The IMF estimate that Britain would suffer the biggest damage, losing 4% of its GDP. But Ireland would be nearly as badly hit, with the EU as a whole losing 1.5% of its economic output. A timely reminder of the dangers ahead, as negotiators struggle to resolve issues such as the Irish border, and future custom arrangements. More here: Royal Mail\u2019s shareholders have given the company a bloody nose. Around 70% of votes cast by shareholders at today\u2019s the annual meeting were against the resolution on the director\u2019s remuneration report. That\u2019s a major rebellion. Investors are unhappy that new CEO, Rico Back, has been handed a 17% pay rise compared to previous boss Moya Greene. Back on the drop in UK retail sales.... and Paul Mumford at Cavendish Asset Management argues that shops can\u2019t just blame the weather (or the football!): While hot weather and sporting events have been a great boost for sales of waistcoats, it has clearly diverted shoppers away from some areas of the high street. Other areas such as convenience stores might have seen an increase in footfall due to ice cream sales and ready-made meals. It\u2019s all too easy to use the weather as an excuse each time figures aren\u2019t as expected. Whether it\u2019s \u201ctoo hot\u201d or \u201ctoo cold\u201d, it seems that some retailers have been unable to find a climate that is \u201cjust right\u201d for them this year. Perhaps businesses would be wise to instead understand these figures as a signal of a downward trend, and adapt accordingly It\u2019s official: Britain\u2019s Gaucho restaurant chain has gone into administration. Deloitte have taken control of the Argentine-themed group, which employs 1,500 people. Hundreds of workers are being laid off immediately, as the company\u2019s Cau chain is being closed. The remaining jobs could also be lost soon, if a buyer for Gaucho can\u2019t be found. Just in: US media conglomerate Comcast has abandoned its plan to take over rival 21st Century Fox. In a statement, Comcast says it will focus on its attempt to acquire the broadcaster Sky (which 21CF is also trying to buy.) This leaves Disney clear to pursue its own deal to buy 21CF. Indeed, Comcast chief Brian Roberts has congratulated Disney on winning the race for Fox: However, the Disney-Fox deal could yet be disrupted if Comcast wins the battle to buy Sky (of which Fox owns 39%). Complicated, eh? Newsflash: Two former City traders have been sentenced to jail for conspiring to fix the Euribor interbank lending rate. Reuters has the details: Former star Deutsche Bank trader Christian Bittar and Philippe Moryoussef, who once worked at Barclays, were sentenced to jail by a London court on Thursday for plotting to rig global interest rates. The two Frenchmen, friends outside work who went skiing together, were convicted of conspiracy to defraud by dishonestly manipulating the Euro interbank lending rate (Euribor), a benchmark for trillions of financial contracts and loans, between January 2005 and December 2009 for profit. Bittar, 46, was handed a sentence of five years and four months. Once one of the world\u2019s best-paid traders, he pleaded guilty in March and has been in custody since. Moryoussef, 50, was sentenced to eight years after a jury unanimously convicted him last week. He did not take part in the trial, having skipped bail and sought refuge in France. A jury failed to reach a verdict on three other individuals; the Serious Fraud Office said earlier today it will seek a retrial. Last week, Britain was gripped by Donald Trump\u2019s working visit, including a glitzy dinner at Oxfordshire\u2019s Blenheim Palace. Some business chiefs stayed away - perhaps nervous of being seen to kowtow to the US president, or simply deterred by his views on migration, protectionism or women\u2019s rights. But others donned their evening wear to welcome Turmp. One top UK business leader, Dame Helena Morrissey, has now explained that she took part, because it\u2019s \u201cvery important\u201d to engage with the US at this time. She told Sy News: We engage with companies that we don\u2019t agree with everything they are doing. It\u2019s important that we engage with politicians and countries, particularly the US, which is such an important trading partner for the UK.\u201d More here: Here\u2019s my colleague Richard Partington on the retail sales data: The World Cup and the summer heatwave kept British shoppers away from the high street last month, despite encouraging stronger sales of food, drink and barbecues across the country. Revealing a surprise fall in retail sales in June, the Office for National Statistics said clothing stores and other non-food retailers suffered from reduced footfall amid the hot weather and football celebrations. The volume of goods sold across the whole of the retail industry dropped by 0.5% last month compared with May, missing City expectations for a rise of 0.2%. Sales at foods stores edged up 0.1% over the month. The latest snapshot from the ONS will add further pressure on the Bank of England to delay an expected rise in interest rates next month after weaker readings for growth in workers\u2019 pay and inflation, which unexpectedly stayed at a one-year low in June. The surprise fall in retail sales triggered a sell-off of the pound, which fell against the dollar to a 10-month low of just below $1.30. The Financial Times also reckons the much-anticipated August interest rate hike is now in doubt, following June\u2019s weak retail sales figures. The FT\u2019s Cat Rutter Pooley says: The pound had been hesitant to test the $1.30 level, despite testing times for Theresa May\u2019s leadership \u2014 and her control of the Brexit process \u2014 and underwhelming UK inflation data on Wednesday. The inflation data had already raised questions about the likelihood of the Bank of England being able to raise rates in August, as markets had expected, sending sterling down to $1.3008 on Wednesday before rebounding to $1.3068 at the close. But disappointing retail sales figures for June \u2014 when the current heatwave gripping the UK began \u2014 compounded the price growth figures, sending the pound down below $1.30 and suggesting politics and fundamentals are both exerting a weight. Reuters is reporting that the pound has hit an eight-month low against a basket of rival currencies. That\u2019s due to June\u2019s weak retail spending (which makes an August interest rate rise less likely) and anxiety over Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union. Brexit anxiety is on the rise today, after the European Commission warned member states to prepare for the possibility that the UK tumbles out of the EU without a deal. The pound is also losing ground against the euro, as the drop in retail sales in June disappoints the City. Sterling is down 0.35 of a eurocent at \u20ac1.12, a four-month low, and bobbing around the $1.30 mark against the US dollar. The World Cup and the long sunny spell brought cheer to some shops, but gloom to others, says Andrew Westbrook, head of retail at RSM. He explains: With record breaking weather and the England team making a stunning start to the World Cup, you might have expected the feelgood factor to translate into bumper retail sales in June but you\u2019d only be half right. \u2018Supermarkets appear to have been the big winners with the strongest three-month on three-month growth since May 2001. \u2018There\u2019s also evidence that shoppers splashed out on refreshing their summer wardrobes, upgrading their TVs, ordering in food and gambling. \u2018However, footfall on the high street was down in June versus last year, resulting in a monthly decline of 0.5 per cent in the quantity bought in non-food stores. Encouragingly for small retailers, the amount sold by specialist food stores (including butchers and bakers) was up 25.3% in June compared to a year ago. That follows a slump of 17.8% a year ago, and may be due to the growing popularity of \u2018artisan\u2019 outlets. The warm weather may also have helped here - if people headed to their local butcher for BBQ suppliers or their high street sourdough bakery for picnic treats. Not even internet spending could save the UK retail sector last month, says Kathleen Brooks, research director of Capital Index. She writes: Although retail sales figures can be volatile, there is a growing sense that the UK economy is slowing down sharply, and with the political backdrop deteriorating, the Bank of England needs to have a pretty solid reason for hiking rates when it meets next month. The details of the report are worth noting. Declines in UK sales last month were broad based with clothing and household goods leading the way. Not even the internet could boost the retail sales figures: non-store retailing saw volumes fall by 1.4%, and the annual rate for non-store or internet sales retreated to 9.8% in June, compared with 16.1% in May. Today\u2019s retail sales data shows that Brits spent 0.3% more at petrol stations last month -- due to rising fuel prices. Food spending was flat, while non-food stores suffered a chunky drop in takings. UK retail sales could remain weak if the Brexit negotiations continue to struggle, warns ING economist James Smith. Consumer spending has driven UK growth in recent years, but Simon French of Panmure Gordon reckons those days are over... Here\u2019s Jeremy Thomson-Cook, chief economist at WorldFirst, on the consumer spending slowdown: Investors are not willing to back the pound with data disappointing and the political situation becoming even more fractured. Once again, it may be easy to ascribe such a slip in sales to the recent good weather; the combination of the World Cup and the temptation of a pub garden will have kept the hospitality sub-sector buoyant but elsewhere trade will have been lacklustre. We expect a bounce back in July especially with the recent news that holidaymakers are staying home as opposed to hitting the beaches of the Med for their weeks off.\u201d We\u2019ve now learned this week that UK retail sales fell in June, inflation was flat at 2.4%, and wage growth slowed. Is the Bank of England really going to look at this data and conclude that we need higher borrowing costs? Until recently, an August rate hike looked likely. Now it\u2019s more of a coin-toss. The retail spending picture is less gloomy if you look at the last quarter. Sales are up 2.1% in the April-June period, as Britain shook off its winter gloom. Office for National Statistics senior statistician, Rhian Murphy explains: \u201cRetail sales grew strongly across the three months to June 2018 as the warm weather encouraged shoppers to buy food and drink for their BBQs. \u201cHowever, in June retail sales actually fell back slightly, with continued growth in food sales offset by declining spending in many other shops as consumers stayed away from stores and instead enjoyed the World Cup and the heatwave.\u201d June\u2019s disappointing retail sales have added to the Brexit anxiety enveloping the pound, says Naeem Aslam of City firm Think Markets: The pound has come under brutal selling pressure as the retail sales data was extremely bad. In simple words, the retail data has made the matter worst for the British pound which was already suffering from disappointing inflation number and a tumultuous week of politics. NEWSFLASH: UK retail sales shrank by 0.5% in June. This is much weaker than the 0.2% growth the City expected, and dashed hopes that the warm weather and England\u2019s World Cup campaign would boost spending. The Office for National Statistics says that football fever and the heatwave may actually have kept people out of the shops. While hot weather and World Cup celebrations increased food store sales, it was suggested by retailers that these factors resulted in a decrease in footfall in non-food stores; which, along with non-store retailing, resulted in a monthly decline of 0.5% in the quantity bought. This has hit the pound hard -- sterling has fallen by three-quarters of a cent to $1.298, its weakest level since last September. Khoon Goh, head of Asia research at ANZ Bank, has spotted that China suffered a small capital outflow last month. Not a serious level, but maybe a sign that some nervous companies or individuals are trying to move money abroad. That might intensify, if the yuan keeps falling.... Some underwhelming earnings figures are weighing on Europe\u2019s stock markets today. Advertising giant WPP has fallen almost 4% in London, after its French rival Publicis startled traders by reporting a drop in sales in the last three months. UK defence firm Babcock are also suffering, with shares down 9%. It lowering its revenue growth target for this year, partly due to delays in British government spending on submarines. Over in the City, shares in Sports Direct have slumped by almost 10% after it told investors its stake-building in department store chain Debenhams has kocked \u00a385m off its profits. Laith Khalaf, Senior Analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, says the curious \u201cstrategic investment\u201d has cost SPD dearly. Sports Direct now owns 29.7% of Debenhams, just under the 30% threshold which would require a formal takeover bid. The company has a string of such \u201cstrategic investments\u201d, which also includes House of Fraser, French Connection and Goals Soccer Centres, and it\u2019s hard to fathom the precise strategy at play here. Sports Direct is also trying to rebuild its reputation after the exposure of \u2018Victorian\u2019 working practices at its warehouse. CEO Mike Ashley was quick to flag up that SPD has been ranked \u201camong the ten companies with the most improved reputation in the UK\u201d... The Chinese media are reporting that banks are being encouraged to boost lending, and support small firms. It\u2019s a significant sign that Beijing is taking a more hands-on approach to stimulating the economy; understandably, given the disruption that new US tariffs on Chinese exports could cause. Royal Bank of Canada have summarised the key points: China\u2019s big banks are now being given cash and told to go and lend more/buy corporate bonds amid the sharp contraction in shadow banking Local news sources are reporting that the Chinese Banking and Insurance regulator (CSRC) has asked financial institutions to \u201cearnestly implement\u201d plans to help reduce financing costs for small firms (the ones with generally lower credit ratings), saying that big lenders (state banks) should \u201ctake the lead\u201d China Business News reported the People\u2019s Bank of China plans the use of its medium term lending facility (MLF) to encourage bank loans and investment in lower-rated corporate debt. These moves help to explain why the yuan is weakening today. China is easing monetary policy, at a time when other central banks are trying to unwind their stimulus programmes or raise interest rates. As Sue Trinh of RBC puts it: The Chinese central bank will be buying (more) corporate bonds and China is doing more QE as the rest of the world\u2019s major central banks march toward tightening/policy normalisation. The selloff is gathering pace, as traders spot that Beijing isn\u2019t intervening to prop its currency up again. The yuanis now down 0.6% today at 6.7876 per dollar in offshore trading, a new one-year low. Margaret Yang Yan of CMC Markets says: \u201cGravity is doing its job again as monetary policy diverges further between US and China\u201d. Gao Qi, foreign exchange strategist at Scotiabank, blames the US-China trade spat for the yuan\u2019s weakness....and predicts it will continue. \u201cMarket concerns resulting from uncertainty such as trade war continue to weigh on sentiment. Investors will keep pushing the yuan to 6.8 per dollar. The PBOC will step in, if one-sided depreciation pressures are seen. China\u2019s central bank is deliberately letting the yuan depreciate, says Hannah Anderson of J.P. Morgan Asset Management. \u201cIn contrast to earlier this year, today\u2019s weakness seems to reflect a more explicit policy decision. After signaling it would accept more volatility in the currency, the PBoC has followed up by lowering the daily fixing rate. Policy makers\u2019 responsiveness to market pressures that have been building all year is encouraging, especially as China\u2019s financial system seeks to become more globally integrated. She adds that the yuan is likely to keep weakening, given the slowdown in Chinese growth, and the strength of the US dollar. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The Chinese yuan has hit a one-year low, as trade war fears continue to loom over the global economy. The yuan, which is usually closely controlled by Beijing, has slipped to 6.784 against the US dollar in offshore trading. That suggests that Chinese policymakers are allowing their currency to weaken, in the face of anxiety over the tariffs being imposed by the US. The yuan has suffered steady losses in recent months - it was trading around 6.3 to the US dollar back in April, before Donald Trump ratcheted up the pressure on Beijing: Previously, the People\u2019s Bank of China has intervened in the markets to prevent the yuan falling through the 6.7 mark. Not any more, it seems. Bloomberg explains: The fixing \u201csignals the PBOC is not defending any line in the sand for the exchange rate and is comfortable with gradual yuan depreciation,\u201d said Tommy Xie, an economist at Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp. in Singapore. The signs of easing are \u201ccertainly not supportive to the yuan, and the currency may see another wave of selling pressures ahead.\u201d A weaker currency will help Chinese exporters to cushion the blow of US tariffs (as it makes their goods more competitive). But it will also fuel concerns that China may be heading for bumpier times, especially after growth weakened a little in the last three months.... Also coming up today Retail sales data will show whether UK shops got a much-needed World Cup boost. Economist predict that takings were 3.5% higher than a year ago in June Michael Hewson of CMC Markets says: We\u2019ve had the feelgood factor of an England football team reaching the semi-finals of the World Cup as well as some scorching weather which is likely to have prompted some decent spending on big screen TV\u2019s, clothing, food and drink and gardening paraphernalia. Consumer giant Unilever and high street retailer Sports Direct are reporting results this morning. Neither look too impressive. Unilever seems to have missed City forecasts - posting underlying sales growth of 1.9%, vs expectations of 2.2% for the last quarter. It\u2019s cited challenges in several regions, including industrial action in Brazil. Sports Direct, meanwhile, has reported a 2% drop in \u201cUK Sports Retail revenue\u201d in the last year. Pre-tax profits tumbled by 72% (from \u00a3281m to \u00a377m), partly due to buying shares in struggling rival Debenhams.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Comcast has pulled out of its pursuit of 21st Century Fox, turning its focus to trumping Rupert Murdoch\u2019s attempt to take full control of Sky. The US media and cable company\u2019s decision to end its battle with Disney will make Murdoch\u2019s long-held ambition of buying the 61% of Sky he does not already own a more difficult task. Last week, in a day of bid and counterbid, Comcast tabled a \u00a326bn offer to buy Sky, trumping Murdoch within hours of the media mogul making a new \u00a324.5bn offer. Sky\u2019s independent committee has recommended that shareholders accept Comcast\u2019s offer. \u201cComcast does not intend to pursue further the acquisition of the 21st Century Fox assets and, instead, will focus on our recommended offer for Sky,\u201d said Brian Roberts, chairman and chief executive of Comcast. Sky\u2019s share price fell 2% following Comcast\u2019s news, indicating investor fears that Murdoch might not now return with an improved bid. Under the deal that Fox has with Disney, Murdoch must gain consent to raise his bid. With Comcast out of the Fox hunt, it is not clear if Disney will decide it needs to also own the 61% of Sky not already owned by Murdoch\u2019s company. Fox owns the other 39% of Sky. While both Fox and Sky have huge strategic value to Comcast, analysts had speculated that Sky\u2019s 23 million pay-TV customers across Europe would prove to be the bigger draw. For Comcast, a Sky deal would make it the world\u2019s largest pay-TV operator \u2013 it is already the biggest in the US \u2013 and at a stroke reduce its almost total dependence on the US for revenues. Owning Sky would result in Comcast\u2019s non-US revenues rising from 9% to 25% of its total. If Comcast is successful in taking over at least 51% of Sky the company has said that it could live with the Murdochs or Disney as minority shareholders, but it hopes to engineer a full takeover. It is unlikely either company would remain a minority shareholder in the event Comcast succeeds. Comcast had also been involved in a bidding war against Disney for Fox, last month tabling a hostile all-cash $65bn bid that topped Disney\u2019s first offer. Disney subsequently sweetened its offer to $71.3bn and recently gained regulatory approval in the US, with Fox shareholders due to vote on the deal on 27 July. Given the timescale, analysts had concluded that Comcast realistically had until the end of this week to come back with a new Fox offer to top Disney. The US department of justice\u2019s decision to appeal against a court ruling on its attempt to stop AT&amp;T\u2019s acquisition of Time Warner cast doubt on whether Comcast would be able to gain approval for any deal for Fox. \u201cI\u2019d like to congratulate Bob Iger and the team at Disney and commend the Murdoch family and Fox for creating such a desirable and respected company,\u201d said Roberts. Under UK takeover rules, Murdoch has until 8 August to submit a new bid for Sky. The agreement between the two companies states that Murdoch pays up to \u00a313 a share, Disney for each \u00a31 a share above that. The deal Murdoch tabled last week valued Sky at \u00a314 a share.",

Sky\u2019s independent committee has recommended that shareholders accept Comcast\u2019s offer.</p> <p>\u201cComcast does not intend to pursue further the acquisition of the 21st Century Fox assets and, instead, will focus on our recommended offer for Sky,\u201d said Brian Roberts, chairman and chief executive of Comcast.</p> <p>Sky\u2019s share price fell 2% following Comcast\u2019s news, indicating investor fears that Murdoch might not now return with an improved bid. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8c0583921046fe7cbc0bc83a3cd64fa09e10146b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8c0583921046fe7cbc0bc83a3cd64fa09e10146b/0_377_6091_3655/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Brian Roberts, chairman and CEO of Comcast\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Brian Roberts, chairman and chief executive officer of Comcast, said his company will focus on acquiring Sky.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Drew Angerer/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Under the deal that Fox has with Disney, Murdoch must gain consent to raise his bid. With Comcast out of the Fox hunt, it is not clear if Disney will decide it needs to also own the 61% of Sky not already owned by Murdoch\u2019s company. Fox owns the other 39% of Sky.</p> <p>While both Fox and Sky have huge strategic value to Comcast, analysts had speculated that Sky\u2019s 23 million pay-TV customers across Europe would prove to be the bigger draw. </p> <p>For Comcast, a Sky deal would make it the world\u2019s largest pay-TV operator \u2013 it is already the biggest in the US \u2013 and at a stroke reduce its almost total dependence on the US for revenues. Owning Sky would result in Comcast\u2019s non-US revenues rising from 9% to 25% of its total.</p> <p>If Comcast is successful in taking over at least 51% of Sky the company has said that it could live with the Murdochs or Disney as minority shareholders, but it hopes to engineer a full takeover. It is unlikely either company would remain a minority shareholder in the event Comcast succeeds.</p> <p>Comcast had also been involved in a bidding war against Disney for Fox, last month<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/jun/13/fox-comcast-buy-offer-latest-rupert-murdoch-sale-disney\"> tabling a hostile all-cash $65bn bid</a> that topped Disney\u2019s first offer. </p> <p>Disney subsequently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jun/20/disney-raises-offer-for-21st-century-fox-to-713bn-and-outflanks-comcast\">sweetened its offer to $71.3bn</a> and recently gained regulatory approval in the US, with Fox shareholders due to vote on the deal on 27 July.</p> <p>Given the timescale, analysts had concluded that Comcast realistically had until the end of this week to come back with a new Fox offer to top Disney. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2018/jul/12/sky-independent-directors-should-learn-valuation-is-art-not-science-rupert-murdoch-comcast\">Sky's independent directors should learn valuation is art, not science | Nils Pratley</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The US department of justice\u2019s decision to appeal against a court ruling on its attempt to stop AT&amp;T\u2019s acquisition of Time Warner cast doubt on whether Comcast would be able to gain approval for any deal for Fox.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d like to congratulate Bob Iger and the team at Disney and commend the Murdoch family and Fox for creating such a desirable and respected company,\u201d said Roberts.</p> <p>Under UK takeover rules, Murdoch has until 8 August to submit a new bid for Sky.

In a practice understood to be common across the retail industry, the luxury brand burned \u00a328.6m of products, including \u00a310.4m worth of beauty items, according to its annual report. Retailers say the measure is needed to protect intellectual property and prevent illegal counterfeiting by ensuring the supply chain remains intact. Burberry said it only destroyed items that carried its trademark and only worked with specialist companies able to harness the energy from the process in order to make it environmentally friendly. It said the destruction of cosmetic items was a one-off related to a licence agreed last year with the beauty company Coty. A company spokesman said: \u201cBurberry has careful processes in place to minimise the amount of excess stock we produce. On the occasions when disposal of products is necessary, we do so in a responsible manner and we continue to seek ways to reduce and revalue our waste.\u201d The company\u2019s clothing is priced at the high end of fashion retail, with men\u2019s polo shirts selling for as much as \u00a3250 and its famous trench coats costing about \u00a31,500. According to the Times, more than \u00a390m of Burberry products have been destroyed over the past five years, and shareholders have questioned why the unsold products were not offered to the company\u2019s private investors. The group has said it takes its environmental obligations seriously, and recently joined the Ellen MacArthur Foundation\u2019s Make Fashion Circular initiative to prevent waste in the industry. However, environmentalists and social media users criticised the company on Thursday. Kirsten Brodde, who leads the Detox My Fashion campaign at Greenpeace, said Burberry \u201cshows no respect for its own products and the hard work and natural resources that are used to make them\u201d. Burberry, which is gearing up for the first collection under its new chief creative officer, Riccardo Tisci, announced last week that its same-store sales grew by 3% in the 13 weeks to 30 June, with revenues rising slightly from \u00a3478m to \u00a3479m. It warned that sales in the UK and Europe had been knocked due to weaker tourist demand, but that Chinese tourists had lifted sales in Hong Kong, Korea and Japan.",

      "bodyText": "Britain crashing out of the EU without a deal would inflict significant economic pain across Europe, leaving the region without any winners, the International Monetary Fund has warned. As the new Brexit secretary, Dominic Raab warned Europe to prepare for a no-deal exit, the IMF said such an outcome would hurt the UK most but would also have damaging economic consequences for Ireland and other EU nations. In its annual health check for the euro area, the Washington-based fund said economic growth across the 27 remaining EU states would fall by as much as 1.5% by 2030, if Britain falls back on World Trade Organisation rules for its trading relationship with the EU after leaving next year. While economic output for the UK would drop by more than twice that amount \u2013 wiping out almost 4% of GDP \u2013 Ireland would suffer by almost as much as a result of its strong ties to Britain and shared border. The Netherlands, Denmark and Belgium, with similar close proximity and trading links, would also lose around 1% of GDP. Smaller nations with deep financial links to the City of London, such as Malta, Cyprus and Luxembourg, would also be negatively affected by a hard Brexit, the fund warned. The IMF said the long-run impact from a hard Brexit would be spread across the EU as a result of the economic and financial ties spanning the region, which have grown closer by about 40% over the past quarter century. The UK ranks among the EU\u2019s three largest trading partners, accounting for 13% of trade in goods and services. There are also complex supply chain links between companies across the bloc. The Fund warned that the lack of progress between Brussels and Westminster in Brexit talks has raised the risk of a disruptive exit. It said: \u201cThe strength of euro area-UK integration implies that there would be no Brexit winners.\u201d Mahmood Pradhan, the deputy director for the European department at the IMF, said: \u201cWe are very concerned. It\u2019s quite late in the process and we don\u2019t see any clarity yet on the future relationship and we\u2019re getting near some important deadlines.\u201d While hopes remain for a deal by the time the EU Council meets in October ahead of the UK\u2019s formal departure in March next year, ministers were preparing to release more than 70 documents setting out preparations businesses would need to make were the UK to leave without an agreement. The European commission also plans to release an advisory document to the EU27 on the consequences of a breakdown in talks. The fund also warned that a free trade agreement between London and Brussels \u2013 the option preferred by Theresa May \u2013 would still have many negative consequences for both sides. Assuming the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, but strikes a broad free trade agreement, the IMF said GDP could drop by up to 0.5% across the EU. Britain and Ireland would again suffer losses above the average, at more than 2% of GDP. The IMF said a \u201crelatively benign\u201d Brexit scenario, whereby Britain remained a member of the European Economic Area \u2013 similar to the arrangement for Norway \u2013 would cause \u201cnegligible\u201d losses. This is not the first time the fund has intervened in Brexit. Ahead of the referendum two years ago, the IMF predicted that a vote to leave the EU would trigger a stock market crash and a recession in 2017, drawing angry reactions from Brexit campaigners who attacked its record on economic forecasting. The forecasts proved incorrect. The British economy avoided recession and the stock market hit a record high, however the UK has fallen to the bottom of the G7 growth league and households have lost \u00a3900 each because of higher levels of inflation, according to the Bank of England. Pradhan said the fund was open to scrutiny about its models, but added: \u201cWe believe [the latest assessments] are reasonably robust. There\u2019s always an amount of uncertainty about these estimates and we would acknowledge that.\u201d",

Accountants from Deloitte have been appointed joint administrators at the owner of the Gaucho and Cau chains. Deloitte said that Cau, which has 22 outlets in the UK and employs 540 people, will be closing immediately while 16 Gaucho outlets \u2013 the more upmarket brand in the group \u2013 will continue to trade while administrators look for a buyer. There are a further 765 staff employed in the Gaucho restaurants and the group\u2019s head office, whose jobs may be at risk if a buyer cannot be found. Deloitte made a blunt assessment of Cau\u2019s shortcomings. Matt Smith, joint administrator, said: \u201cUnfortunately the Cau brand has struggled in the oversupplied casual dining sector with rapid overexpansion, poor site selection, onerous lease arrangements and a fundamentally poor guest proposition. As such, the decision has been made to close this loss-making part of the group with immediate effect, unfortunately resulting in today\u2019s redundancies.\u201d Smith said steps were being taken to stabilise the Gaucho chain as it sought expressions of interest in a buyout. He said the chain \u201ccontinues to trade well in its market segment, is profitable and has a strong underlying brand and guest loyalty\u201d. Gaucho is the latest in a number of high street dining chains to run into trouble amid a squeeze on consumer spending and overexpansion fuelled by private equity investors. Prezzo, Byron and Jamie\u2019s Italian have shut outlets and cut hundreds of jobs while veteran restaurateur Sir Terence Conran\u2019s Prescott &amp; Conran venture called in administrators last month. The private equity firm Equistone bought the Gaucho group in January 2016 and said earlier this week that it had put forward a funded rescue plan to the restaurant\u2019s lenders. The business had looked at a number of ways to restructure but ran into crisis when it faced a tax bill of more than \u00a31m which was due to be paid last Friday. The company also owes \u00a350m to its banks. Restaurants and retailers are under pressure from rising business rates, minimum wage costs and food prices as well as a slowdown in consumer spending because inflation has outstripped wage increases. On Thursday, administrators for Poundworld said all stores and warehouses would close by 10 August, with the loss of 1,600 more jobs. Nearly 80 stores and the warehouses will close by 29 July with the last 112 shops shutting in the following weeks. Administrators have already announced the closure of 145 stores with the loss of nearly 1,800 jobs since they were called in last month.

Morrissey, the head of personal investment at Legal &amp; General, attended the black-tie event for business leaders at Blenheim Palace, hosted by Theresa May, on 12 July. She was among 150 guests, who dined on smoked salmon, steaks and strawberries. In an interview with Sky News, Morrissey said: \u201cIt was a constructive thing to do. I understand why there were protests but I do believe that we need to be discussing these issues rather than hoping they will go away.\u201d Guests included the chief executives of FTSE 100 firms such as Rolls-Royce, Barclays and BP, as well as Britain\u2019s richest man, Sir Jim Ratcliffe, but some business leaders were absent, notably Sir Richard Branson and Lord Sugar, who have had high-profile spats with the US president in recent years. Morrissey said it was a \u201cslightly surreal\u201d experience \u2013 \u201clike attending a wedding with lots of waiting around\u201d \u2013 and noted she was one of few women, although she thought \u201cthat was more of a reflection on the lack of women in senior roles in business in this country rather than any sort of protest\u201d. She added: \u201cI went because it\u2019s very important that we engage. We engage with companies that we don\u2019t agree with everything they are doing. It\u2019s important that we engage with politicians and countries, particularly the US, which is such an important trading partner for the UK.\u201d Trump\u2019s visit, which led to widespread demonstrations, came as UK and European firms grapple with the fallout from US trade tariffs on steel and aluminium. The US president also provoked controversy when he told the Sun newspaper that May\u2019s Chequers Brexit plan would make a trade deal with the US impossible but later rowed back. Talking about the trade dispute between the US and Europe, Morrissey said business dinners like the one with Trump were all about \u201csetting out your stall\u201d and relationship building, showing off Britain\u2019s \u201cfantastic\u201d technology, defence and financial and professional services.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The World Cup and the summer heatwave kept British shoppers away from the high street last month, despite encouraging stronger sales of food, drink and barbecues across the country. Revealing a surprise fall in retail sales in June, the Office for National Statistics said clothing stores and other non-food retailers suffered from reduced footfall amid the hot weather and football celebrations. The volume of goods sold across the whole of the retail industry dropped by 0.5% last month compared with May, missing City expectations for a rise of 0.2%. Sales at foods stores edged up 0.1% over the month. The latest snapshot from the ONS will add further pressure on the Bank of England to delay an expected rise in interest rates next month after weaker readings for growth in workers\u2019 pay and inflation, which unexpectedly stayed at a one-year low in June. The surprise fall in retail sales triggered a sell-off of the pound, which fell against the dollar to a 10-month low of just below $1.30. Although some of the decline in consumer spending had been anticipated after two strong months for retail sales in April and May when the royal wedding encouraged shoppers to spend, economists were surprised by the scale of retreat. Overall, sales in the second quarter of the year were the strongest since 2004, helped by the stronger spending in April and May. Retailers have been coming under intense pressure over the course of the past year as hard-pressed consumers face weak wage growth as well as higher levels of inflation triggered by the Brexit vote. Major firms including House of Fraser, Marks &amp; Spencer and Mothercare are closing hundreds of stores between them as a consequence. An increasing shift towards online shopping has also damaged the high street. Sales online as a total of all retailing remained unchanged at 18% last month, while the ONS said internet shopping for clothing and footwear continued to achieve record new proportions of online retailing. There were some early indications the hot weather created winners as well as losers on the high street. While supermarkets benefited from the rising mercury tempting consumers to buy more beer, wine and barbecue food, other retailers have suffered over recent weeks. George Brown of City bank Investec said: \u201cThe heatwave served as a blessing as well as a curse.\u201d The homeware retailers DFS Furniture and Dunelm warned of lower profits during the heatwave, while a survey from the British Retail Consortium and KPMG found furniture, footwear, household appliances and stationery sales all declined. The big six energy supplier SSE also said its first-quarter profits would be about \u00a380m lower than expected, because the recent hot weather has affected its wind turbines and reduced demand for household energy consumption. Kathleen Brooks of the financial spread better Capital Index said: \u201cIt turns out that when the weather is this good in the UK we don\u2019t go shopping and we hit the beach instead.\u201d Economists said the weak reading for consumer spending in June could suggest the bounceback recorded in April and May was only temporary, as shoppers returned to the high street to make purchases they delayed during the freezing weather caused by the \u201cbeast from the east\u201d earlier in the year. After sales dropped again in June, they said retailers might be facing several rockier months ahead. May\u2019s warm weather could also have led many consumers to buy summer clothes earlier in the year, which could be another reason for weaker sales in June. Paul Mumford at Cavendish Asset Management said: \u201cIt seems that some retailers have been unable to find a climate that is just right for them this year. Perhaps businesses would be wise to instead understand these figures as a signal of a downward trend, and adapt accordingly.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The world\u2019s biggest tobacco firm has been accused of staging \u201ca digraceful PR stunt\u201d by offering to help NHS staff quit smoking to help mark the service\u2019s 70th birthday. Philip Morris International (PMI), which makes Marlboro cigarettes, is under fire for apparently trying to breach global rules which stipulate that tobacco manufacturers should be treated as pariahs. The company has prompted anger among doctors, MPs and health campaigners by making its offer to all NHS bodies in England, NHS England boss Simon Stevens and health secretary Matt Hancock. Bob Blackman, the Conservative MP who chairs the all-party group on smoking and health, said he was appalled when learning of the plan. \u201cThey have the cheek to say they want to support the 70th anniversary of the NHS, but it\u2019s clearly just a commercial opportunity to use the NHS to promote their heated tobacco products,\u201d he said. Blackman intends to air his concerns about the scheme during a debate in parliament on Thursday on the government\u2019s tobacco control plan. Steve Brine, the public health minister, branded the proposal by the American-owned corporation, which makes six of the world\u2019s 15 best-selling brands of cigarettes, \u201centirely inappropriate\u201d and said he would tell NHS trusts not to get involved. \u201cOur aim to make our NHS \u2013 and our next generation \u2013 smoke-free must be completely separate from the commercial and vested interests of the tobacco industry,\u201d Brine told the Guardian. \u201cPhilip Morris International will be well aware that its actions are entirely inappropriate and we will be contacting all NHS trusts to remind them of their obligations.\u201d Under the World Health Organisation\u2019s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) the governments of countries which are signatories, which include Britain, must ensure that tobacco manufacturers play no role in public health, because their products kill so many people. The framework\u2019s accompanying guidance said: \u201cParties should not accept, support or endorse partnerships and non-binding or non-enforceable agreements as well as any voluntary arrangement with the tobacco industry or any entity or person working to further its interests.\u201d Mark MacGregor, PMI\u2019s director of corporate affairs in the UK and Ireland, said in the letter: \u201cTo support the 70th anniversary of the NHS, we are keen to work with you to help the 73,000 NHS employees who currently smoke, to quit cigarettes. This would be a collaborative campaign: you would provide cessation advice for quitting nicotine altogether, and for smokers who do not quit we can help them switch to smoke-free alternatives.\u201d Paul Burstow, the former Liberal Democrat health minister in the coalition government, has written to Stevens to complain about PMI\u2019s initiative after receiving its letter in his capacity as the chair of the Tavistock and Portman NHS mental health trust in London. \u201cThe proposal PMI is making is merely an attempt to rebrand itself as a socially responsible entity, something parties to the FCTC like the UK should not collude with,\u201d he said. \u201cAny such collaboration with the tobacco industry would be completely inappropriate and a breach of the UK government\u2019s obligations as a party to the WHO FCTC.\u201d Burstow has asked Stevens to write to NHS trusts to warn them they should ignore PMI\u2019s offer. NHS England refused to say what action, if any, Stevens would take. The Royal College of Physicians (RCP), which represents hospital doctors, recently estimated that NHS staff who smoke have 56% more days off sick than colleagues who do not, costing the NHS \u00a3101m a year and a further \u00a36m in treatment costs. \u201cThis is a disgraceful PR stunt. PMI is pretending partnership would benefit the NHS, when actually it would give them a massive commercial advantage. They could promote their own harm-reduction products as NHS-endorsed,\u201d said Deborah Arnott, the chief executive of the anti-tobacco charity Action on Smoking and Health. Prof Jane Dacre, the president of the RCP, added: \u201cWe are deeply suspicious of the motives of Philip Morris International in their opportunistic attempt to become involved in smoking cessation in hospitals. The NHS needs to be much better at helping patients going to hospital to give up smoking, but it shouldn\u2019t accept help from the tobacco industry. \u201cThe best way Philip Morris could help people stop smoking is to stop making cigarettes altogether.\u201d In a statement PMI said: \u201cThe NHS is a remarkable and respected British institution. However, on current trends, the NHS will be over 100 years old before smoking is at an end in the UK. Quitting smoking is always the best option for NHS workers but we believe we can play a vital role in supporting those who don\u2019t to switch to better alternatives, such as e-cigarettes and heated tobacco.\u201d",
