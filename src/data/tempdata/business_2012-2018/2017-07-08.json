      "bodyText": "In December 1994, Gary Hollis was hit by a bike in Ultimo in Sydney. The culprit wore a bright green jacket, tumbled over his own handlebars, and when he got up said \u201csorry mate\u201d and left. Hollis suffered a knock to his knee that the joint never fully recovered from. He sued the rider\u2019s courier company and won in a case that went all the way to the high court. Hollis\u2019s lawsuit is well known among the discontented workers of the gig economy \u2013 the growing number of Uber drivers and Deliveroo riders who work for less than minimum wage as independent contractors, but who are pushing for something more. Last week the Fair Work ombudsman announced it was launching an investigation into Uber, amid claims of sham contracting from Ride Share Drivers United (RSDU), a lobby group that argues drivers are effectively employees and should be treated as such. The ombudsman is also \u201cworking with\u201d a Deliveroo rider on a similar complaint against the food delivery company. Prof Ron McCallum, an expert in labour law from the University of Sydney, says the Fair Work investigation could change the structure of the gig economy. If drivers are said to be legal employees of the San Fransico-based company, rather than subcontractors, they would be entitled to much higher wages, superannuation and annual leave for those who drive more than 38 hours a week. From the current rate of $1.38 a kilometre for Uber, or $10 a delivery for Deliveroo, workers could be entitled to an award wage of $20.36 an hour, with penalty rates and overtime \u2013 as happened in a recent sham contracting ruling against Pizza Hut delivery drivers. Fair Work\u2019s Pizza Hut ruling, taken with Hollis\u2019s case, is encouraging advocates such as RSDU and the Transport Workers Union to push for change. In Hollis\u2019s case, the high court ruled that the rider who knocked him down was an employee of his courier company because he wore its uniform \u2013 offering a direct parallel with the bicycles and bright branded jackets of Deliveroo, Foodora and Uber Eats. McCallum says the test the ombudsman will apply is one of control. \u201cThe question really will be: what control does Uber have? Is the employee required to work specific times? What are the disciplinary procedures here? We know employers can discipline employees but they can\u2019t discipline contractors. It\u2019s all very slippery.\u201d As the law stands, McCallum is anticipating that Uber drivers will not be classed as employees when Fair Work delivers its findings. Deliveroo, he believes, is a more likely scenario. But for both, it is an uncertain area of law. Last year in the UK an employment tribunal ruled Uber drivers were employees, calling the company\u2019s self-employment argument \u201cfictions\u201d and \u201ctwisted language\u201d. A similar suit from Deliveroo riders in the UK accused the company of \u201cdeliberately fogging\u201d the definition of a contractor, in a case that is still being determined. The UK\u2019s Uber ruling provides an example of how practical effects can inform the law, says McCallum. \u201cIn England, the judges said they were more concerned with what happened on the ground, rather than in the contract, and they took evidence from drivers.\u201d As part of its investigation in Australia, Fair Work is accepting statements from members of RSDU about the level of control they feel Uber exerts. \u201cThere\u2019s room for practical effects to massage the law,\u201d McCallum says. \u201cI don\u2019t think the argument will succeed under current laws, but laws can change\u201d. A union that isn\u2019t a union Max B is the founder of RSDU and whenever anyone asks if he runs a union, he has a clever answer prepared: \u201cWe\u2019re not really a union. The same way that Uber says they\u2019re not a taxi company.\u201d Max, who spoke to Guardian Australia on the condition of a pseudonym for fear of losing his job (\u201cThey\u2019d fire me in a second\u201d), says Uber drivers should be classed as employees and entitled to an award-level wage. Despite having more than 1,000 members, his group has no plans to become a formal union: \u201cWe use technology in just the same way Uber are. They use technology to control the market and control the drivers and we use it exactly the same way: to unite the drivers.\u201d RSDU\u2019s submissions to the ombudsman will constitute an important part of the legal decision. In a media release in June, RSDU said Uber drivers\u2019 inability to negotiate fares or communicate with customers outside the Uber app meant they were subject to a \u201cclassic sham contracting arrangement\u201d. \u201cWe are being treated as subcontractors but we are anything but,\u201d Max says. \u201cUber controls every aspect of our daily work, from the bookings to the ratings. The drivers don\u2019t know where the passenger is going until they are in the car. As a subcontractor you should be able to make a decision whether it\u2019s a profitable trip or not. You should be able to know where you are going. \u201cThe prices aren\u2019t sustainable and drivers have been complaining for a year now. As a subcontractor, drivers should be able to bargain about the price of the service. But Uber does what an employer would do \u2013 set the price. \u201cThey can\u2019t just call us whatever they like and get away with it.\u201d Sarah Kaine is an associate professor at the University of Technology, Sydney, and says the amount of data Uber collects on its drivers was seen as a significant aspect of control in a survey she conducted of gig economy workers. \u201cIf we think about the level of surveillance available to Uber and the amount of data it collects \u2013 speed, location, a whole range of variables \u2013 that\u2019s not usually the kind of thing you collect on a subcontractor,\u201d she says. Kaine also noted that workers\u2019 lost superannuation could have an unanticipated social cost. \u201cIf we have this growing cohort of gig economy workers who are going to fall outside of the super guarantees, who will be supporting these workers when they reach retirement age? \u201cWhen we spoke with drivers, they were aware of needing to \u2013 if they did it long term \u2013 have some super savings. But the reality was if the choice was putting money away from super and getting their car serviced, they choose the latter.\u201d For Max, the mandatory entitlements to superannuation and leave are key to the push for reclassification. \u201cAt the moment, drivers can\u2019t even take a day off. You have to work, you have bills to pay, and Uber pays peanuts. All we want is for drivers to be able to have a life.\u201d Globally, Uber maintains that its drivers are contractors and not employees. In April it was granted leave to appeal against the employment tribunal\u2019s sham contract ruling in the UK. A spokesman for Uber Australia told Guardian Australia it was co-operating with the Fair Work investigation, as did Deliveroo Australia. A spokeswoman for Deliveroo said the ombudsman was collecting information about rider contracts as part of \u201cits normal workplace investigation process\u201d. \u201cIt is important to note that riders are able to log in and log out at will, work for other platforms simultaneously and can delegate or use substitutes,\u201d she said. \u201cThis means they should not be classed as employees, but as independent self-employed contractors.\u201d A spokeswoman for Foodora said it was \u201cconfident with its business policies and procedures with regards to our contracted riders\u201d. But Tony Sheldon, the national secretary of the Transport Workers Union, says he is confident companies such as Deliveroo and Foodora are committing wage theft. \u201cIn the case of Uber, there is at the very least morally wage theft. In the case of Deliveroo and Foodora that is actual wage theft. Those people deserve to go jail.\u201d Fair Work has not said when it will deliver its findings, or whether an official investigation into Deliveroo will commence, but McCallum says even if the drivers are unsuccessful they could potentially pursue Uber under unfair contractor legislation. Sheldon wants the public to consider changes to laws, including the creation of a special award category for gig economy workers. \u201cIn an ethical and moral sense it goes to the fundamentals of working people having rights. It\u2019s the ombudsman\u2019s job to look at the law. It\u2019s ours and the community\u2019s job to look at fairness\u201d. Sheldon says the union is ready and willing to represent gig economy workers and has reached out to Uber and Deliveroo workers\u2019 groups. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a history of organising owner-operators along with employees. We\u2019ve spoken to some of the Uber driver groups in Queensland. They should come into the partnership of the union. They uniquely bring the life and experience of doing the work. They are the most significant people in this equation.\u201d Max says formal union membership is something to consider, but admits he has never had much union experience. \u201cI was never part of a union, but I have a lot of law knowledge. I have been living in Australia for many years, and I came to this country because I love the values of this country and the way this country protects the working rights of people. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of red tape; it requires a lot of resources to form an official union. People don\u2019t have time. They\u2019re losing money every day.\u201d He says he will continue pushing as a lobby group and a \u201csort of union\u201d. \u201cOnly when you work for Uber do you realise the level of exploitation. And you say \u2018Wow is that allowed?\u2019 It\u2019s amazing, to be happening in a country like Australia under everyone\u2019s noses. \u201cIt\u2019s like herding cats, but there is a way to do it. It\u2019s very hard to gain people\u2019s trust but you do what you can do.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The original Camden Town Brewery, which nestles under a set of railway arches in London\u2019s fashionable Kentish Town, is one of the most Instagrammed places in the UK. It\u2019s hard to imagine the brewer, which was in the vanguard of the craft beer movement, is going to have the same appeal to hipsters after its move to a huge purpose-built shed on an anonymous north London industrial estate. But this is the new home of Hells lager: a \u00a330m facility that Jasper Cuppaidge, the brewer\u2019s founder, hopes will turn it into a national and potentially international success. It is the largest investment in London brewing for 30 years. Camden made headlines in 2015 when Cuppaidge sold the business he had founded with friends to Anheuser-Busch InBev, the world\u2019s biggest drinks company, for an estimated \u00a385m. The deal led to handwringing as fans complained that it had literally and metaphorically sold out. \u201cIt\u2019s wonderful that people care so much about us,\u201d says Cuppaidge. \u201cI hope they can see we are better than we were 12 months ago and only getting better. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve lost any fans.\u201d Cuppaidge is hard-headed about the financial realities of succeeding in such a cash-thirsty industry. \u201cThere\u2019s \u00a328m of investment sitting in there and that doesn\u2019t come out of the air,\u201d says the Australian, pointing to the brewhouse that backs on to the river Lee. \u201cWe were always going to have investment from one of the bigger brewers because we needed to grow the brand. We wanted that expertise and distribution network, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve joined up to.\u201d On Monday, another multinational, Carlsberg, said it had bought London Fields Brewery in Hackney, east London. It joins fellow craft brewers Camden and Meantime, which now belongs to Japan\u2019s Asahi, in foreign ownership. In April, BrewDog founders James Watt and Martin Dickie sold a minority stake to a private equity firm for just over \u00a3200m \u2013 despite pulling Camden\u2019s beers from its bars when the AB InBev deal was announced. Camden is small beer to AB InBev, which owns more than 500 brands including Budweiser, Stella Artois and Beck\u2019s. Last year it also swallowed its rival SABMiller in a monster \u00a379bn deal while simultaneously doing Camden-style deals around the world. Camden\u2019s success was a decade in the making for Cuppaidge, whose grandfather built the McLaughlin\u2019s brewery in Queensland. In 2006, the entrepreneur took over a former Wetherspoon pub in Hampstead and the following year started making beer in the basement. Four years later it decamped to the arches under Kentish Town West station but, with sales growing at 70% a year, it was forced to outsource some production. Last year, two-thirds of the 100,000 hectolitres of its beer \u2013 the equivalent of 17.6 million pints \u2013 was made in Belgium but that outsourcing will now end. \u201cBy the end of July all our production will be made between NW1 and EN3,\u201d says Cuppaidge of a shift that will bring immediate financial savings, as it will eliminate the need to \u201ctruck beer all over the country\u201d. The new brewhouse, which is close to the M25 and North Circular Road, gives Camden the capacity to produce up to 500,000 hectolitres (88 million pints) a year. \u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to do something big from one location,\u201d says Cuppaidge. \u201cI like to walk out and speak to everybody. I wasn\u2019t scared of scale, but I was scared of diversifying sites.\u201d The first batches of Camden Hells are already bubbling away in giant stainless-steel vessels but ancillary areas, including the visitor centre, are still under construction, with teams of tradespeople working furiously before the grand opening on 29 July. AB InBev is led by Carlos Brito, who is famous for ruthless cost cutting at the companies he acquires. So could Cuppaidge come under pressure to cut corners ? \u201cI don\u2019t believe it will happen,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re a standalone business within the mothership.\u201d \u201cI had breakfast with Carlos,\u201d he adds. \u201cHe was charming and we had a great conversation. The company has a winning culture. They are saying: Camden, keep doing what you do, and do it better, and if we can help you, we will.\u201d But for many craft aficionados, small is beautiful. The Society of Independent Brewers has created a logo to use on pumps showing the brewer is not owned by a global company and produces less than 200,000 hectolitres a year \u2013 criteria that Camden no longer meets. \u201cI couldn\u2019t possibly talk about being a mega-brewer because I\u2019m not one: we\u2019re Camden,\u201d says Cuppaidge. \u201cThere is a total authenticity to us and our brand. For us, craft is a way of thinking. It is about attention to detail and a focus, not only how you use your ingredients, but who you get them from. It doesn\u2019t matter how big a volume of beer is produced.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Hundreds of banks, insurers, fund managers and other major City firms have until Friday 14 July to tell the Bank of England how they intend to cope with a hard Brexit. The order from the Bank was issued in April and has forced the financial industry to spell out plans that would allow them to keep operating in the \u201cmost adverse potential outcomes\u201d \u2013 possibly by picking a rival EU centre from which to conduct business and rejigging the way they are currently structured. The Bank wants to know how banks will react in all possible situations: the UK leaving the EU without a trade agreement, no implementation period, no co-operation over regulation and no so-called mutual recognition, which allows products to be sold cross-border. The request for action plans is aimed not only at UK groups, but big US and Japanese banks that use the UK as their way into the EU, and the EU banks which operate in Britain through \u201cpassporting\u201d arrangements, which might mean they need to apply to the Bank for authorisation to keep doing business. The Bank has asked for summaries of plans of up to 20 pages for some of the firms. However, a number of largely UK-focused organisations are allowed to provide more succinct submissions. Andrew Gray, head of Brexit at PricewaterhouseCoopers, who advises businesses on how to deal with the UK\u2019s exit from the EU, said he expected banks to be providing \u201cobservations about what consumers they could continue to serve, and where they would see the problems and how they would solve them\u201d. He added that each submission to the bank is also expected to set out \u201chow the board of directors is being kept up to date\u201d. But, he said, it was too early for them to spell out the details of how many jobs might have to move abroad. \u201cWhile they are having to plan for hard Brexit, they don\u2019t want to overcommit and spend money they absolutely don\u2019t have to,\u201d said Gray. The City is awash with rumours about how many jobs will be affected and which financial centres in the remaining 27 EU states might benefit from the UK\u2019s exit, especially if an outline transition deal is not set out by year-end. JP Morgan has indicated up to 1,000 London-based bankers will be relocated to Dublin, Frankfurt and Luxembourg, while Goldman Sachs \u2013 still constructing a new HQ in London \u2013 has said it will need more people in a number of EU centres, including Madrid, Milan and Paris. Deutsche Bank is reportedly considering moving large parts of its London trading and investment banking operations to its Frankfurt base. Previously, up to 4,000 of its 9,000 UK-workforce have been reported to be at risk. Japanese banks Nomura and Daiwa are also said to have picked Frankfurt for some of their operations. While the plans that the Bank\u2019s regulatory arm, the Prudential Regulation Authority, is asking for are intended to be contingency proposals, there are fears they could be enacted at the end of this year if there is no more information about transition arrangements. Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority, said last week: \u201cIt would be regrettable if firms feel they\u2019re in a bind because they have to do practical implementation of contingency planning before they know the context in which they\u2019re going to be working in the future.\u201d Stephen Jones, head of the new industry lobby group UK Finance, made a similar point. He said it would take time to reorganise legal contracts and set up trading floors by the exit date of March 2019. \u201cIf transitional arrangements are not clear and agreed by the end of the year, it\u2019s going to be very hard to stop the train that has already left the station in terms of the transfer of jobs, and the activity that underpins those jobs, to the financial centres within the EU,\u201d said Jones.",

    "webTitle": "After Andrew Tyrie: the race to become the Commons\u2019 new inquisitor general", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A hotly contested race for one of Westminster\u2019s most coveted jobs enters its final stages this weekend as six Conservatives battle to run the powerful Treasury select committee. Once seen as a consolation prize for MPs passed over for a cabinet seat, since the financial crisis of 2008 the occupant has become better known \u2013 and arguably more influential \u2013 than many ministers. The last chairman, Andrew Tyrie, won a reputation as Westminster\u2019s inquisitor general after his relentless grillings of Mark Carney, Philip Hammond, government officials and countless bank bosses. Tyrie would have been a shoo-in had he not quit as an MP at the election. His retirement created an unexpected vacancy for a battle that ahead of a ballot in which all MPs can vote looks too hard to call. Tyrie held memorable sessions that forced Paul Flowers, the drug-taking former chairman of Co-op Bank, to admit he didn\u2019t know the size of the bank\u2019s balance sheet and prompted Charlotte Hogg to resign as deputy governor of the Bank of England for failing to disclose her brother\u2019s senior role at Barclays. The prestigious nature of the job is illustrated by the list of candidates \u2013 such as Nicky Morgan, sacked as education secretary by Theresa May, and two MPs who sat on the committee under Tyrie\u2019s chairmanship. Morgan is hoping to win the backing of Labour, Liberal Democrat and SNP members for her soft Brexit approach. Another high-profile contender is Jacob Rees-Mogg, who has sought to reach out to opposition MPs by saying he would not use the chair as a megaphone for his pro-Brexit views. The ballot is on Wednesday and the winner should be announced that evening or the following day. Here are their pitches \u2013 and the issues they say are their main concerns. NICKY MORGAN The only candidate with cabinet experience and a former City solicitor, Morgan says she has proved her independence since losing her job as education secretary, especially over Brexit. One Labour MP said Morgan would get support from opposition parties. She would be the first woman in the post. Main concerns Ensuring full parliamentary scrutiny of Brexit. Public sector pay. A focus on the wider economy and not just the City. Job prospects Seen as one of the frontrunners. JACOB REES-MOGG In terms of high public profile, Rees-Mogg rivals Morgan. The tussles between him and Carney were among the highlights of the committee\u2019s proceedings in the last parliament, with the Somerset MP accusing the Bank governor of \u201cpolitical partisanship\u201d because of his dire warnings over Brexit. But Rees-Mogg \u2013 who is still working in City fund management \u2013 insists that he would not use the chair for anti-Europe sermonising, leaving that to the Brexit committee. His aim, he says, would be to \u201cachieve consensus and balance\u201d. Main concerns Holding Hammond and Carney to account. Brexit \u2013 in a non-partisan way. The failings of the banks, particularly in customer service. Job prospects Another frontrunner, but he will need to win some opposition support. JOHN PENROSE The MP for Weston-super-Mare has already had one of his ideas \u2013 the creation of a UK sovereign wealth fund \u2013 included in the Conservative manifesto. The Treasury committee, he says, should be at the centre of the \u201cnew and changing debate about the kind of post-Brexit economy we want to have\u201d. Married to Dido Harding \u2013 the former chief executive of TalkTalk who sits on the court of the Bank of England \u2013 he has pledged to show there is no conflict of interest. Main concerns Moving the economic debate on from Brexit. Looking at the new divides in Britain: between those who own assets and those who don\u2019t, and between the young and the old. Job prospects Dark horse. CHARLIE ELPHICKE A former tax lawyer, Elphicke would like the committee to conduct a root-and-branch investigation of the tax system. \u201cIt makes people rightly angry when large businesses pay less in tax than the person cleaning their offices,\u201d he says. He is also eager to make sure that poorer people can have access to local banks. Main concerns Cracking down on tax avoidance by multinationals. Ensuring growth is spread more evenly across the country. Getting young people on the housing ladder. Brexit preparations for the Treasury. Job prospects Will hope his views on tax and fairness will win the support of opposition MPs. RICHARD BACON One of the less well-known candidates, Bacon has been MP for South Norfolk since 2001. He is playing up his credentials as an experienced committee hand, and has the backing of some high-profile Labour MPs. \u201cI would adopt a collegiate approach, taking account of the interests of all committee members,\u201d he says. Main concerns Public finances, ensuring growth is better balanced, and the UK\u2019s productivity puzzle. Job prospects Although he is a trained economist with cross-party support, he would be a surprise winner. STEPHEN HAMMOND Another experienced contender, Hammond has been the MP for Wimbledon for 12 years. A member of the committee in the last parliament, Hammond had previously worked in the City for 20 years. As a former transport minister, he would want to see the government\u2019s proposed increased spending on infrastructure benefiting all parts of the country. Main concerns Scrutinising Brexit. The lack of competition in personal banking. Opening up the committee so that any MP can suggest subjects for investigation. Job prospects A quietly effective member in the last parliament, Hammond may lack cross-party support.",

      "bodyText": "Philip Hammond will have to rip up the government\u2019s deficit reduction plan or increase taxes for most of the population if he decides to end seven years of austerity by sanctioning higher public sector pay, reversing welfare cuts and providing extra cash for Whitehall departments, a thinktank has said. The Resolution Foundation said it was possible for the chancellor to do a U-turn in his autumn budget, but only if he was prepared to increase borrowing by more than \u00a3100bn over the next four years or to make individuals and companies pay more tax. Its report, Living With Austerity, said that given the curbs on spending since 2010 it was understandable that politicians would want to revisit the debate, but that they had to face up to the costs involved. Theresa May\u2019s failure to win an overall majority in last month\u2019s general election has led to many leading Conservatives \u2013 including the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, health secretary Jeremy Hunt and the education secretary Justine Greening, suggesting that the time has come to abandon the 1% cap on public sector pay. Hammond has been resisting calls for a more generous approach to public sector workers and has insisted that the government stick to its plan of eliminating the budget deficit by midway through the 2020s. The Resolution Foundation said public sector pay was only a small part of austerity, and that removing the 1% cap would amount merely to tinkering. Its analysis found that the public sector was facing two \u201ccrunches\u201d, a squeeze on pay that would bring it back to 2005 levels by 2020 and a loss of jobs that would result in a headcount below five million for the first time this century. The report said allowing public sector pay to rise in line with pay in the private sector for the rest of the decade would cost \u00a39.7bn by 2021-22, while expanding the public sector workforce in line with the increase in the UK\u2019s population would cost a further \u00a311.5bn over the same period. Far more households are affected by the freeze on benefits than by the public sector pay cap, but the foundation said the cost of unfreezing them would be lower. Allowing working age benefits to rise in line with inflation from next April would cost \u00a33.6bn by 2021-22, while reversing the cuts to work allowances in universal credit would cost around \u00a33.2bn. Since 2010, only the NHS, international development and schools have been spared budget cuts. The report said allowing departmental spending (including public sector pay) to rise in line with GDP growth after the end of the current spending review in 2019-20 would cost \u00a312.3bn by 2021-22. Reversing the cuts planned for the next two years would cost a further \u00a311bn. Matt Whittaker, chief economist at the Resolution Foundation, said it was no surprise that squeeze fatigue had set in. \u201cBut recognising that fatigue is very different to doing something about it. If we want a serious discussion on ending austerity, we need to get serious about prioritising what spending we really want to see rise and how we want to pay for it \u2013 and that means tax rises for most of us. \u201cThe chancellor can start by cancelling unneeded corporation tax cuts. But if he wants to raise serious revenues despite the challenges of having a minority government, which the Office of Budget Responsibility may force him to irrespective of plans to end aspects of austerity, then he could look at freezing tax thresholds, which could raise up to \u00a312.5bn.\u201d The foundation said weaker than expected economic expansion and pay growth this year meant there was a significant risk that the independent Office for Budget Responsibility would downgrade its forecasts for the public finances in the budget. The chancellor would need to respond to these development even before any moves to \u201cend austerity\u201d, it added.",
