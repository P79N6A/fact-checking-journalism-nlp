      "bodyText": "AstraZeneca is being investigated by US authorities over a clinical trial that was used to win marketing approval for its heart drug Brilinta, casting fresh doubts over the medicine. Brilinta sales have been a disappointment since its launch two years ago, although AstraZeneca has recently stepped up marketing efforts and hopes that further clinical tests will underscore its value in preventing heart attacks. The British drugmaker said on Thursday it received a civil investigative demand from the US department of justice, seeking documents and information regarding the Plato (platelet inhibition and patient outcomes) study. AstraZeneca plans to co-operate with the DOJ and its chief executive, Pascal Soriot, said he was \"very confident\" in the findings of the trial. \"It was guided by a strong academic group who oversaw the trial and its conduct,\" he told reporters after announcing third-quarter results. AstraZeneca did not disclose the exact nature of the investigation and DOJ spokesman Peter Carr in Washington said he had no immediate comment on the case. The results of the 18,000-patient trial were first reported in 2009 and went on to form the basis of successful new drug applications in the US, Europe and other markets. Brilinta was launched in 2011. Aspects of the study, which relied heavily on patients recruited in eastern Europe, have been criticised by medical experts. Poland and Hungary together accounted for 21% of the subjects studied \u2013 more than double the US and Canada combined. James DiNicolantonio of Ithaca New York and Ales Tomek of Charles University in Prague raised several questions about the conduct of the study in a recent paper in the International Journal of Cardiology. In particular, their analysis found that patients in the Plato trial who were monitored by AstraZeneca were reported as having more beneficial effects from taking Brilinta than those monitored by an independent clinical research organisation. Those conclusions, however, have been strongly disputed by Lars Wallentin of Uppsala clinical research center in Sweden, the principal investigator on Plato.Brilinta is a key product for AstraZeneca but its progress to date has been slow, with sales in the third quarter edging up to just $75m (\u00a347m) from $65m in the three months to end-June \u2013 a long way from the multibillion-dollar sales potential that analysts once predicted. Among the challenges it faces is the fact that US doctors tend to use high-dose aspirin for cardiovascular patients, and clinical trials suggest AstraZeneca's new drug does not work as well in this setting. AstraZeneca hopes that a new clinical study called Pegasus will put to rest any uncertainties about the effectiveness of Brilinta and also increase uptake of the medicine. Results are expected in 2014. In addition to the DOJ inquiry into Brilinta, AstraZeneca also disclosed it had received a subpoena from the US Attorney's Office in Boston, seeking documents and information related to the safety of its antipsychotic drug Seroquel. The news came as AstraZeneca promoted Marc Dunoyer to chief financial officer, plugging a gap in the management team as it grapples with falling sales and profits. Dunoyer, 61, who joined from rival GlaxoSmithKline in June, will replace well-respected finance chief Simon Lowth, whose departure to join BG Group had been announced. Hit by generic competition to key drugs, sales and profits at AstraZeneca continued to slide in the third quarter, underscoring the challenge facing Soriot, who has been in the job for just over a year. Lowth has been viewed as a steady hand on AstraZeneca's finances, and the appointment of Dunoyer, who lacks recent direct CFO responsibility, may concern some investors. Soriot and Dunoyer have their work cut out to turn around AstraZeneca after years of failure to come up with new drugs to replace those reaching the end of their patent life. Improving AstraZeneca's record in drug research is Soriot's top priority, but he told Reuters in June that turning around the company would take three to four years. It will also require investment in the science behind new medicines and AstraZeneca said it expected to spend more, with 2013 spending increasing at the upper end of its prior guidance range of a low-to-mid single-digit percentage rise on 2012. Mark Clark of Deutsche Bank said higher operating costs suggested there would be \"minor\" downgrades in earnings forecasts. Sales in the quarter slid by 6% to $6.25bn, weighed down by the loss of patent protection on several drugs \u2013 including, in some markets, its top-selling cholesterol fighter Crestor. \"Core\" operating profit was $2.03bn. Growth in drug sales in China, where destocking and an anti-corruption drive disrupted business, slowed to 13% from 21% in the second quarter. But AstraZeneca fared a lot better than GlaxoSmithKline, the company at the centre of the scandal, whose China sales crashed 61% percent in the third quarter.",

Mortgage firm sues over Libor US mortgage finance company Fannie Mae sued nine of the world's largest banks yesterday, including Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland, accusing them of colluding to manipulate interest rates and seeking more than $800m of damages. In a complaint filed in the US district court in Manhattan, the company accused the banks of manipulating the London Interbank Offered Rate, or Libor, as well as other interest rate benchmarks. Fannie Mae said this manipulation caused it to lose money on interest-rate swaps and other transactions. It is also seeking punitive damages. Smaller rival Freddie Mac filed a similar lawsuit in March against more than a dozen banks. \"Fannie Mae filed this action to recover losses it suffered as a result of the defendants' manipulation of Libor,\" a spokesman said. \"We have a responsibility to be good stewards of our resources.\" Four of the banks sued by Fannie Mae \u2013 Barclays, Rabobank, Royal Bank of Scotland and UBS - have previously settled with regulators over similar allegations and admitted wrongdoing. The other bank defendants are Bank of America, Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank and JPMorgan Chase. Representatives of Bank of America, Barclays, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan and RBS declined to comment. The other banks did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The case is Federal National Mortgage Association v Barclays Bank Plc et al, US District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 13-07720. RBS has already signalled it is involved in the new global investigation into foreign exchange trading and last night it was reported to have suspended two traders.",

The Bank of England revealed that UK consumer borrowing has been growing at its fastest since 2008. George Osborne may levy capital gains tax on foreign owners of British properties. Business activity surged in the U.S mid west, but markets were unmoved. Continental markets closed up, while the FTSE 100 ended the day down 0.7% at 6,731 points Thank you for following and for your comments. See you tomorrow. Some late breaking corporate news...Bill Adderley, the founder of the homeware chain Dunelm, has been secretly building a \u00a3250m stake in Marks &amp; Spencer. The Guardian's Simon Goodley reports that billionaire is now the largest shareholder. The entrepreneur has acquired the shares during the past 18 months, a period in which the M&amp;S share price has risen by almost 40%. The disclosure, triggered by stockmarket rules when a shareholder owns more than 3% of a company, unmasked Adderley as M&amp;S's largest private shareholder. He founded Dunelm at Leicester market with his wife Jean in 1979 after leaving his job as manager of Woolworths in the town, and then went on to float the business on the stock exchange. His wealth soared by \u00a3390m to \u00a31.1bn, according to the 2013 Sunday Times Rich List. Adderley and his family, who live near Uppingham, Rutland, still own more than half of Dunelm. Some reading to end the day Nouriel Roubini, the economist credited with predicting the collapse in the U.S housing market and the global bust that followed, has warned that countries risk another bubble. He writes about the unappealing trade-off facing policymakers: stifle the recovery to avoid risky bubbles, or go for growth and risk fuelling next financial crisis. Growth rates have remained stubbornly low and unemployment rates unacceptably high, partly because the increase in money supply following QE has not led to credit creation to finance private consumption or investment. Instead, banks have hoarded the increase in the monetary base in the form of idle excess reserves. There is a credit crunch, as banks with insufficient capital do not want to lend to risky borrowers, while slow growth and high levels of household debt have also depressed credit demand. As a result, all of this excess liquidity is flowing to the financial sector rather than the real economy. Near-zero policy rates encourage \"carry trades\" \u2013 debt-financed investment in higher-yielding risky assets such as longer-term government and private bonds, equities, commodities and currencies of countries with high interest rates. The result has been frothy financial markets that could eventually turn bubbly. Read the full piece here. It is almost closing time in London and the FTSE 100 is down on the day, after weak profits at Shell triggered a sell-off on the oil giant. On continental markets it is a different story, with all the major indices finishing higher. As Michael Hewson of CMC Markets observes, European investors are taking a much more relaxed view of the Fed's assessment of the global economy. However, he predicts that the European Central Bank will be forced to provide liquidity to banks. Given the rise in European unemployment to a record 12.2% and Italian unemployment to a record 12.5%, speculation is rising that the ECB will be forced into another [long-term refinancing operation] or some other easing measure in the coming months, in order to keep the recent improvement in manufacturing economic data on track. This reflects the consensus view, after ECB governing council member Ewald Nowotny told CNBC that the bank would provide more liquidity when the current round of cheap loans expire . What is clear is there will be liquidity provision. So, here is where we are at market closing. UK FTSE100 -0.68% at 6,731 points Germany's DAX +0.18% at 9,026 points France's CAC40 at +0.57% at 4,298 points Italy's FTSE MIB +0.96% at 19,351 points Spain's IBEX +1.32% at 9,907 points Just for fun... Background here. The euro has been sliding in value, after data this morning showed record unemployment in the eurozone (10.21am). Against the dollar the euro has hit a two-week low of $1.3594. Versus the pound, the euro fell 0.9% to 84.865 pence, putting sterling on track for its biggest daily rise in six months. Against the dollar, the pound was broadly flat. Sterling has benefited from data showing thathouse prices were rising at their fastest rate in three years in October, raising the prospect that the Bank of England could start tightening monetary policy sooner than previously thought. With the threat of another Russia-Ukraine gas war bubbling away, Reuters reports that the European Union and International Monetary Fund are \"in advanced discussions\" on providing emergency funds to Ukraine in the event of economic retaliation from Russia. Ukraine is expected to sign a free trade and association agreement with the EU at the end of the month, as long as it meets certain conditions, including the release of former prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko from prison. Russia has warned Kiev of the consequences of going into the EU's orbit. As the Guardian's Shaun Walker recently reported: Russia wants Ukraine to join its own Customs Union of former Soviet states, and has repeatedly sent dire warnings that by signing the deal with Europe, Ukraine will lose billions of dollars and face myriad problems. One Kremlin economic adviser even predicted that if the deal is signed \u201cpolitical and social unrest\u201d will ensue and Russia could cease to recognise Ukraine\u2019s status as a sovereign state. This has prompted EU officials to draw up contingency plans to supply Ukraine with gas, while the International Monetary Fund is readying emergency funds. An anonymous EU official told Reuters: The IMF plays a very important role and there are ongoing discussions with them about standby arrangements. Observers believe $10-15 billion may be needed to help Ukraine meet upcoming debt repayments. US stocks are flat or slightly down today, after hitting record highs earlier in the week. Investors are in a more cautious mood and seem unmoved by the surge in business activity in the midwest. Dow Jones -0.19% at 15,590 points S&amp;P 500 -0.38% at 1,760 points Nasdaq composite +0.05% at 3,932 points Hi all, JR taking over from Angela Monaghan.

It was the biggest monthly increase in more than 30 years, and the highst level since March 2011. It also came in well above economists' forecasts, which had assumed a fall to 55. Double digit gains in new orders, production and order backlogs all boosted the business index, produced by the Institute for Supply Management and MNI Indicators. New orders were at the highest level in nine years. Philip Uglow, chief economist at MNI Indicators: The government might have shut down but Chicago area companies powered ahead in October as orders and production surged. While it is a little surprising to see such a large rise in activity, the consistent increase in the Barometer over the past four months suggests the recovery is gaining traction. Despite the upbeat news, and lower jobless claims, US markets are down: Dow Jones: -0.47% at 15,544 S&amp;P 500: -0.29% at 1,758.2 UK consumers borrowed money at a rate not seen since the onset of the crisis in the three months to September. The Bank of England said than net unsecured lending to consumers rose by \u00a3864m last month, the biggest jump since December. The Bank incorrectly reported earlier in the week that it had risen by a much smaller \u00a3411m. The jump meant that unsecured lending in the three months to September increased by 5.8% on an annual basis, the strongest growth since April 2008. It will no doubt raise concerns that Britain is relying on a debt-fuelled recovery, at a time when policymakers have repeatedly stressed the need to rebalance the UK economy away from spending and towards manufacturing and exports. Ross Walker, UK economist at Royal Bank of Scotland: For me there is an amber warning light here - not an immediate risk but a medium-term financial stability concern. The notion that we have gone through a full deleveraging cycle ... is abject nonsense. (Quotes from Reuters.) In other news, a Brazilian oil tycoon who boasted less than two years he would become the world's richest man, has taken the first step in filing for bankruptcy. Lawyers from Eike Batista's firm OGX said they had asked a court in Rio de Janeiro to grant them protection from creditors, in what could lead to the biggest bankruptcy ever seen in Latin America. Jonathan Watts, the Guardian's Latin America correspondent, writes: The bankruptcy \u2013 said to be the biggest ever seen in Latin America \u2013 is the latest stage in the rapid break-up of the empire built by Batista, whose wealth was estimated at $34.2bn in March 2012. Back then, his companies were expanding aggressively into offshore oil and gas fields, planning to build the biggest shipyard in the southern hemisphere, and bidding for everything from world cup stadium management to entertainment licenses. But poor output from OGX's wells has prompted major investors to pull out of Batista's companies even more quickly than they rushed in. The share price of OGX has plummeted, and earlier this month the company failed to make an interest payment. If the court approves the request, OGX will have 60 days to come up with a corporate restructuring plan. The 56-year-old Batista \u2013 a former racing car driver \u2013 has already sold off his fleet of six private planes and helicopters, according to local media, and is dismantling his yacht. Batista's demise may also have a wider impact on confidence in the economy, which limped along last year with growth of less than 1%. The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell by 10,000 to 340,000 last week, the US Labor Department said. The fall was roughly in line with expectations. The 4-week rolling average was 356,250, an increase of 8,000. European markets have regained some ground, although the FTSE 100 is still down, with chemical manufacturer Croda International the biggest faller following a disappointing fourth-quarter outlook. FTSE 100: -0.36% at 6,753.19 CAC 40: +0.48% at 4,294.46 DAX 30: +0.17% at 9,025.74 IBEX: +0.98% at 9,874.9 FTSE MIB: +0.27% at 19,219.27 Ireland's banking sector is to be hit by more job losses, as Danske Bank plans to cut up to 150 jobs as it winds up most of its operations in the Republic. This from the Guardian's Ireland correspondent, Henry McDonald: Less than 24 hours after Ireland's prime minister Enda Kenny announced the creation of 335 new hi-tech/digital jobs in the Republic the country's stricken banking sector has been hit with more redunancies. Up to 150 bank jobs are to be shed by Danske Bank which is to wind up most of its operations in the Republic. The Danish owned bank - formerly the Northern Bank - has just announced that it has returned to profits for the first time since the downturn in its main base of Northern Ireland. But in this year alone Danske Bank has made a loss of 34m euros (\u00a329m) south of the border. However, the overall picture for the Irish labour market was more positive, as Henry McDonald explains: For the first time in four years the number of those on the Republic's live register of unemployed has fallen under 400,000. The jobless total in Ireland is now at 397,000, compared with 408,670 in September. This has been a downward trend since the summer when there were 442,000 people claming various unemployment benefits. The data from the Republic's Central Statistics Office shows a drop of more than 10,000 claiming Job Seekers Allowance. During the downturn Ireland suffered a massive job loss shock with more than 250,000 jobs lost with just over 60 per cent of them being in the then overheated construction and building sector. It is worth noting that while the latest jobs data from Eurostat were generally downbeat, figures for Germany showed employment in Europe's largest economy is now at a record high. This from Philip Oltermann, our Berlin correspondent: Employment in Germany has reached an all-time high, rising to over 42m for the first time since reunification. The federal office for statistics yesterday announced that only 2.8m Germans were out of work in October \u2013 48,000 fewer than in the previous month. But a number of critics warn of reading too much into the latest figures. The German Institute for Labour Market Research points out that the number of Germans working part time or in low-wage, so-called \"mini jobs\" has more than double since reunification, to around 12.7m. The eurozone's unemployment rate remained unchanged at a record high of 12.2% in September. The number of people out of work rose 60,000 to 19.45m. The figures from Eurostat, the EU's statisitcs office, showed the highest rates were in Greece at 27.6% (in July, the latest available data), and Spain at 26.6% in Septemer. The lowest rates were in Austria (4.9%), Germany (5.2%) and Luxembourg (5.9%). Youth unemployment in the eurozone was 24.1%. In the wider European Union the jobless rate was stable at 11% in September, with the number of people out of work up 61,000 to 26.87m. Separate data from Eurostat showed a fall in eurozone annual inflation to 0.7% in October from 1.1% in September. It was the lowest level since November 2009. Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at IHS Global Insight. While this is welcome news for Eurozone consumers as it helps their purchasing power, inflation is getting uncomfortably low for the ECB as it is now substantially below its target rate of \u201cclose to, but just below 2.0%\u201d. An inflation rate of 0.7% could easily be seen as warranting an interest rate cut in itself, and the rise in unemployment heaps further pressure on the ECB to act, but we doubt that the bank will do so at its 7 November meeting. There is clearly a strong faction within the ECB\u2019s governing council against taking interest rates below 0.50% while the bank can also point to overall evidence that the Eurozone is continuing to grow modestly after exiting recession in the second quarter. However, latest developments reinforce our view that the ECB will end up cutting interest rates from 0.50% to 0.25% sooner or later. Indeed, we certainly would not rule out a cut in December, although the ECB may hold off acting until the early months of 2014. George Osborne is exploring whether to impose capital gains tax on foreign owners of British property when he makes his Autumn Statement in December, according to Sky News. Such a move would be an attempt to curb what many see as a house price bubble in London and the South East. Ed Conway, Sky's economics editor: The Treasury has already provisionally costed the measures and is awaiting a final decision from Mr Osborne in the coming weeks. While those living in Britain have to pay capital gains tax of 18% or, more commonly, 28%, if they make a profit when reselling all but their main home, non-resident property owners are currently exempt for all their properties. Britain\u2019s comparatively generous regime is thought to be one of the factors behind the sharp increase in foreign ownership of properties in London. House prices in London rose by nearly 9% in August, compared with around 2% elsewhere in the UK, according to the Office for National Statistics. The price increases have been driven in part by foreign investment, with around 70% of the most expensive London newly-built properties being bought by non-UK citizens, according to estate agency Knight Frank. Gloomy news from Italy as the unemployment rate hit a new record high of 12.5% in September. It was the highest since the statistics office records began in 1977, and compared with an upwardly revised rate of 12.4% in August. It was worse than the 12.3% predicted by economists. Youth unemployment also rose to a fresh high of 40.4% from 40.2% a month earlier. Italy's economy shrank in the third quarter, remaining in recession and lagging other eurozone economies which have started to grow again. Spain, which has been among the hardest hit eurozone economies, grew by 0.1% between July and September. German retail sales fell unexpectedly for a second month in September, down 0.4% on a monthly basis. Economists had expected a 0.4% rise. Consumer confidence also fell unexpectedly, to 7 in GfK's forward looking indicator from 7.1 in October. It was the first survey since the German elections and economists had expected a modest rise to 7.2. Most of the major European indices are lower this morning, following similar falls in US and Asian markets. Investors are feeling unnerved after the US Federal Reserve was less dovish in tone than expected at its monthly policy decision yesterday. FTSE 100: -0.4% at 6,750.72 CAC 40: -0.19% at 4265.96 DAX 30: -0.17% at 8995 IBEX: -0.18% at 9760.12 FTSE MIB: +0.2% at 19,205.23 House prices in Britain rose at the fastest annual rate in more than three years in October, according to Nationwide. The 5.8% surge compared with the same month a year earlier will provide more ammunition to those who argue Britain is at risk of another housing bubble, fuelled partly by the government's Help to Buy Scheme. On a monthly basis house prices rose by 1% this month, pushing the average value of UK house to \u00a3173,678. Nationwide pointed out house prices are still around 7% below the 2007 peak. Robert Gardner, Nationwide's chief economist: House price growth has accelerated as buyer demand has picked up more quickly than the supply of new homes. The risk is that if demand continues to strengthen while the supply of property remains constrained affordability could become stretched. Indeed, average wages have continued to decline in real terms even though employment growth has been fairly robust in recent years. Nevertheless, while house price growth has picked up, at a national level prices remain around 7% below their 2007 peak. Moreover, typical mortgage servicing costs remain modest by historic standards thanks to the ultra-low level of interest rates. A typical mortgage payment for a first time buyer is currently equal to around 29% of take home pay, in line with the long term average.\u201d Read the full story from the Guardian's Hilary Osborne here. Meanwhile UK consumer confidence fell for the first time in six months in October. It was a modest, one point drop on the GfK index to -11. The European Central Bank has made its liquidity swap arrangements with global central banks permanent. The move will see emergency measures put in place during the crisis remain as a precautionary measure. Previously the swap arrangements were considered a temporary measure. The agreement beween the ECB, the Bank of England, the Federal Reserve, the Bank of Japan, the Bank of Canada, and the Swiss National Bank, will allow banks to access global currencies as well as the euro when needed. It means the central banks will be able to make sure banks in their home countries can borrow money from them in any of the currencies involved. The ECB said: The existing temporary swap arrangements have helped to ease strains in financial markets and mitigate their effects on economic conditions. The standing arrangements will continue to serve as a prudent liquidity backstop. There is more reaction today to the Federal Reserve's message yesterday, after it voted to keep its monthly bond buying programme at $85bn (\u00a353bn), and made no change to its forward guidance on interest rates. The decision itself was not unexpected, because of the likely economic damage caused by the government shutdown, but the tone was. As Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, explains: The tone was significantly less dovish than markets had expected, in the process sending markets lower as no mention was made of earlier concerns about tighter credit conditions, and higher interest rates. There was also no mention of the government shutdown with the tone evenly balanced between dovish and hawkish, in a way that in no way acknowledged that the shutdown had even occurred, and this appears to have caught the market off guard, given the recent and likely continued deterioration in the latest economic data. Hewson argues however that the odds of Fed tapering of stimulus this year \"still remain remote\". US markets closed down, and Asian markets were also lower overnight, with the Nikkei down 1.2% at 14,327.94. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and the business world. A reminder of the work left to do in Greece has come from S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices, which says the country no longer classifies as a developed market. Instead, the indices provider gives it emerging market status for the following reasons: The Greek equity market lags behind the advancements in market practices typical of other developed markets.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Pressure is mounting on the European Central Bank to boost activity in the euro area after the latest figures showed a fresh rise in unemployment, and inflation dropping sharply to a four-year low. The jobless total for the 17 nations that use the single currency rose by 60,000 in September to 19.4 million \u2013 the 29th consecutive monthly increase. Unemployment is a million higher than in September 2012 and up by almost four million since the spring of 2011. At 12.2%, the jobless rate was the highest since monetary union began at the end of the 1990s, according to data from Eurostat, the EU's statistical agency. Analysts said the labour market in the euro area had yet to stabilise despite the return of modest growth in recent months. Jobless rates range from 4.9% in Austria and 5.2% in Germany to 26.6% in Spain and 27.6% in Greece, with unemployment in Italy rising to a record high of 12.5% in September. The jobless total in France also rose, up by 34,000 in September and by almost 250,000 in the past year. Unemployment among the under-25s rose by 22,000 in September to 3,548,000 \u2013 nudging up youth jobless rate to 24.1%. In France, the youth jobless rate jumped from 25.6% to 26.1%, while in Italy it increased from 40.2% to 40.4%. Meanwhile, separate figures from Eurostat showed the euro area's inflation rate dropping from 1.1% to 0.7% \u2013 well below the ECB's target of keeping it just under 2%. In contrast to Britain, where dearer gas and electricity bills are pushing up the cost of living, cheaper energy was a big factor in reducing inflation across the euro area. UK inflation, at 2.7%, is now two percentage points higher than in the single currency zone. Chris Towner, director at foreign currency specialists HiFX, said: \"Inflation data from the EU this morning shocked the market as the rate fell alarmingly from 1.1% to just 0.7%, which is the lowest level seen in four years. \"With a strong currency it looks like the risks are increasing for the EU to fall into a 'Japan-like' deflationary spiral, and the ECB may need to act soon and cut rates again.\" Nick Kounis, head of macro research at ABN AMRO, said: \"This raises the question of whether this will prompt a response from the central bank, given that its price stability goal is supposed to be symmetrical. There is certainly a strong case for the ECB to put in place a yet more aggressive monetary easing stance to guard against risks of inflation settling at too low levels. However, there seems to be strong resistance in some corners of the governing council, especially from some of the northern states.\" Howard Archer, economist at IHS Global Insight, said: \"An inflation rate of 0.7% could easily be seen as warranting an interest rate cut in itself, and the rise in unemployment heaps further pressure on the ECB to act, but we doubt that the bank will do so at its 7 November meeting. \"There is clearly a strong faction within the ECB's governing council against taking interest rates below 0.5% while the bank can also point to overall evidence that the eurozone is continuing to grow modestly after exiting recession in the second quarter. \"The ECB will likely limit its action at its November policy meeting to reiterating its forward guidance that it 'expects the key ECB interest rates to remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time'. \"However, latest developments reinforce our view that the ECB will end up cutting interest rates from 0.50% to 0.25% sooner or later. Indeed, we certainly would not rule out a cut in December, although the ECB may hold off acting until the early months of 2014.\"",

He seized his first opportunity for adventure, deferring a place at Oxford University at 16 to hitchhike around South America. He later won a scholarship to Princeton University, where he studied sociology. Taking part in civil rights protests in 1960s America left a deep impression, confirming in him a conviction for tolerance and social equality that permeated his life.</p> <p>He embarked on a career in banking with Chase Manhattan in the UK \u2013 where he met his future wife, Rita \u2013 then with Bankers Trust in New York and Paris, before returning as general manager of the London office. He left in 1990 to set up his own consultancy and pursue a passion for helping small industrial companies, especially those in his beloved north-west, to survive the choppy waters of the business world. He came up with innovative ways for smaller companies to access much-needed development capital.</p> <p>In 2007, while still running the business, he became chair of <a href=\"http://www.ide-uk.org/\" title=\"\">iDE UK</a>, a charity supporting rural communities in the developing world. Taking on an organisation not in the best of shape, he instigated a restructure that transformed it, securing its future and with it the prospects of a quarter of a million farmers around the world. This huge achievement helped earn iDE a place in the Global Journal's top 100 non-governmental organisations worldwide in 2013.</p> <p>Friends, colleagues and family have described my father as a man of fierce intellect and great humanity, modesty, wisdom, humour and kindness. With semi-retirement came more time to enjoy watching sport and theatre, visiting exhibitions and reading his many history books. Most often, though, he could be found walking along the Thames in south-west London or near his home in the Surrey hills, whatever the weather.</p> <p>Through it all, family came first. He is survived by Rita, his daughter, Nicola, son, Alexander, myself and a granddaughter, Jenna.</p>",

He embarked on a career in banking with Chase Manhattan in the UK \u2013 where he met his future wife, Rita \u2013 then with Bankers Trust in New York and Paris, before returning as general manager of the London office. He left in 1990 to set up his own consultancy and pursue a passion for helping small industrial companies, especially those in his beloved north-west, to survive the choppy waters of the business world. He came up with innovative ways for smaller companies to access much-needed development capital. In 2007, while still running the business, he became chair of iDE UK, a charity supporting rural communities in the developing world. Taking on an organisation not in the best of shape, he instigated a restructure that transformed it, securing its future and with it the prospects of a quarter of a million farmers around the world. This huge achievement helped earn iDE a place in the Global Journal's top 100 non-governmental organisations worldwide in 2013. Friends, colleagues and family have described my father as a man of fierce intellect and great humanity, modesty, wisdom, humour and kindness. With semi-retirement came more time to enjoy watching sport and theatre, visiting exhibitions and reading his many history books. Most often, though, he could be found walking along the Thames in south-west London or near his home in the Surrey hills, whatever the weather. Through it all, family came first. He is survived by Rita, his daughter, Nicola, son, Alexander, myself and a granddaughter, Jenna.",

    "webTitle": "Consumer tastes dictated by TV shows and news media, finds report", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "British consumers are shopping round the clock on the internet and what they buy is increasingly influenced by news and entertainment events they see on screen \u2013 from the birth of a new royal baby to The Great British Bake Off and blockbuster movies. The swaddle in which Prince George made his public debut sold out almost immediately, sales of food mixers jumped 62% during the BBC baking show and the horsemeat scandal put up sales of a simple plastic mincer by 48% on the year, according to John Lewis. A new report from middle England's favourite retailer, called How We Shop, Live and Look, says: \"The news agenda, the royal family, celebrities, TV shows and major film premieres all have a big impact\" on what we buy. This year, it says, online searches for trainers spiked during Andy Murray's triumphant run at Wimbledon, while The Great Gatsby film premiere ushered in dapper styles for men and flapper looks for women \u2013 sales of satin gloves more than doubled from a year earlier, handkerchiefs jumped 27% and waistcoat sales soared. Searches for sewing machines tripled when The Great British Sewing Bee was on TV. The next predicted trend is 60s glamour, with the release of Grace of Monaco starring Nicole Kidman. The report also shows that shoppers are using modern smartphones and tablets to buy night and day \u2013 but at the same time increasingly crave nostalgia products such as board games and beard oil. The department store chain echoes other industry reports charting the rise of cyber shopping and shows its shoppers are most likely to log on from phones overnight, they use desktops during the working day and settle down with their tablets in the evening \u2013 shopping from the sofa during TV advert breaks. \"People are shopping 24 hours a day and moving seamlessly from mobile to tablet to desktop throughout the day,\" said Paula Nickolds, buying and brand director for John Lewis. She said the trend put pressure on retailers in a world where shoppers want items fast and fashions change faster. \"What has become increasingly important is buy now, wear now. Consumers don't want to conform to retailers' traditional half-year view of the world,\" she added. Crunching its sales data for the last year, the company says shoppers' most researched and slowest purchase is soft furnishings, while products for children \u2013 from school shirts to toys \u2013 are the fastest buys. The most popular item bought on mobile devices is a simple white Egyptian cotton towel, something the store puts down to it being easy to choose and buy on the go. British brands were in demand, with Ted Baker topping online searches, followed by the term \"iPad\" and then Cath Kidston, the designer behind retro floral and polka dot products The report revealed regional seasonal favourites, with people in the West Midlands most partial to Christmas panettone and shoppers in the south-east bought 2.3 tonnes of chocolate coins \u2013 40% of the total. An analysis of underwear purchases show white lace and leopard print are most common in the north-east, the women of the north-west are most likely to buy thongs and Wonderbras, while the Welsh are most likely to opt for scarlet lingerie. John Lewis has sought to shake off its middle England reputation, arguing its sales data are a reasonable reflection of the British shopping public. The store says it has more customers aged under 34, at 39%, than over 55, at 28% and nearly half of its shoppers have a household income under \u00a330,000. With household budgets under pressure from stagnant wages and rising living costs, entertaining at home continued. Camembert bakers more than doubled in sales, carafes flew off the shelves and sales of ice tongs soared more than 200%. There appeared to be a trend over the last year for buying longer lasting, classic products. In furniture, this durability trend saw a surge in demand for items such as the Herman Miller office chair and Eames lounger. The big fashion trend for men was the \"renaissance of the gent\", with bow tie sales up 15%, cravats by 10% and brogues by 26%. A men's dress cane and a white tuxedo jacket sold out in eight weeks, while the classic Acqua di Parma Colonia was the best-selling men's fragrance. \"It is rejection of the casualisation of work wear. It's Shoreditch Man. It's the same guy who is into male grooming and has a well groomed beard,\" said Nickolds. The retailer has recently reintroduced beard oil as it joins others in tapping into the facial hair craze, a fashion helped by Hollywood stars such as Ben Affleck and Brad Pitt \u2013 and possibly even Newsnight presenter Jeremy Paxman. The report says our living rooms are also changing. It charts the decline of the three-piece suite and shows bigger is now definitely regarded as better for TVs \u2013 the chain's third best-selling model is a 55-inch Samsung.

      "body": "<p><strong> </strong></p> <p>British consumers are shopping round the clock on the internet and what they buy is increasingly influenced by news and entertainment events they see on screen \u2013 from the birth of a new royal baby to The Great British Bake Off and blockbuster movies.</p> <p>The swaddle in which Prince George made his public debut sold out almost immediately, sales of food mixers jumped 62% during the BBC baking show and the horsemeat scandal put up sales of a simple plastic mincer by 48% on the year, according to John Lewis.</p> <p>A new report from middle England's favourite retailer, called How We Shop, Live and Look, says: \"The news agenda, the royal family, celebrities, TV shows and major film premieres all have a big impact\" on what we buy. This year, it says, online searches for trainers spiked during Andy Murray's triumphant run at Wimbledon, while The Great Gatsby film premiere ushered in dapper styles for men and flapper looks for women \u2013 sales of satin gloves more than doubled from a year earlier, handkerchiefs jumped 27% and waistcoat sales soared. Searches for sewing machines tripled when The Great British Sewing Bee was on TV. The next predicted trend is 60s glamour, with the release of Grace of Monaco starring Nicole Kidman.</p> <p>The report also shows that shoppers are using modern smartphones and tablets to buy night and day \u2013 but at the same time increasingly crave nostalgia products such as board games and beard oil.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-421384288\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/30/1383175301792/JL_shopping_WEB.jpg\" alt=\"Britain's shopping habits\" width=\"460\" height=\"425\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The department store chain echoes other industry reports charting the rise of cyber shopping and shows its shoppers are most likely to log on from phones overnight, they use desktops during the working day and settle down with their tablets in the evening \u2013 shopping from the sofa during TV advert breaks.</p> <p>\"People are shopping 24 hours a day and moving seamlessly from mobile to tablet to desktop throughout the day,\" said Paula Nickolds, buying and brand director for John Lewis. She said the trend put pressure on retailers in a world where shoppers want items fast and fashions change faster.</p> <p>\"What has become increasingly important is buy now, wear now. Consumers don't want to conform to retailers' traditional half-year view of the world,\" she added.</p> <p>Crunching its sales data for the last year, the company says shoppers' most researched and slowest purchase is soft furnishings, while products for children \u2013 from school shirts to toys \u2013 are the fastest buys. The most popular item bought on mobile devices is a simple white Egyptian cotton towel, something the store puts down to it being easy to choose and buy on the go.</p> <p>British brands were in demand, with Ted Baker topping online searches, followed by the term \"iPad\" and then Cath Kidston, the designer behind retro floral and polka dot products</p> <p>The report revealed regional seasonal favourites, with people in the West Midlands most partial to Christmas panettone and shoppers in the south-east bought 2.3 tonnes of chocolate coins \u2013 40% of the total.</p> <p>An analysis of underwear purchases show white lace and leopard print are most common in the north-east, the women of the north-west are most likely to buy thongs and Wonderbras, while the Welsh are most likely to opt for scarlet lingerie.</p> <p>John Lewis has sought to shake off its middle England reputation, arguing its sales data are a reasonable reflection of the British shopping public. The store says it has more customers aged under 34, at 39%, than over 55, at 28% and nearly half of its shoppers have a household income under \u00a330,000.</p> <p>With household budgets under pressure from stagnant wages and rising living costs, entertaining at home continued. Camembert bakers more than doubled in sales, carafes flew off the shelves and sales of ice tongs soared more than 200%.</p> <p>There appeared to be a trend over the last year for buying longer lasting, classic products. In furniture, this durability trend saw a surge in demand for items such as the Herman Miller office chair and Eames lounger.</p> <p>The big fashion trend for men was the \"renaissance of the gent\", with bow tie sales up 15%, cravats by 10% and brogues by 26%. A men's dress cane and a white tuxedo jacket sold out in eight weeks, while the classic Acqua di Parma Colonia was the best-selling men's fragrance.</p> <p>\"It is rejection of the casualisation of work wear. It's Shoreditch Man. It's the same guy who is into male grooming and has a well groomed beard,\" said Nickolds.</p> <p>The retailer has recently reintroduced beard oil as it joins others in tapping into the facial hair craze, a fashion helped by Hollywood stars such as Ben Affleck and Brad Pitt \u2013 and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/aug/13/jeremy-paxman-beard-tickles-newsnight-twitter\" title=\"\">possibly even Newsnight presenter Jeremy Paxman</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-421384289\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/30/1383175350855/JL_TVs_WEB.jpg\" alt=\"TV sales over the past year\" width=\"460\" height=\"358\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The report says our living rooms are also changing. It charts the decline of the three-piece suite and shows bigger is now definitely regarded as better for TVs \u2013 the chain's third best-selling model is a 55-inch Samsung. Looking ahead to Christmas, the trend for fast-changing technology alongside traditional tastes is predicted to continue.</p> <p>\"There is a dichotomy of leading edge technology with Christmas trees that are very high tech and the desire for traditional trimmings like gingerbread and candy canes,\" said Nickolds.

      "bodyText": "The government will announce that a planned register setting out the true owners of companies will be open to the public for scrutiny, not just the tax authorities, in a continuing effort to deter tax evasion. A register of beneficial owners was one of the key main demands of campaigners when Britain chaired June's G8 summit of world leaders in Northern Ireland. Campaigners have been determined to break down the wall of secrecy that lies at the heart of much tax evasion and Britain will be the first country to commit to an obligatory public register. David Cameron announced plans in the summer to crack down on UK accountants, lawyers and business figures who use shell companies \u2013 often located in offshore tax havens \u2013 to hide the identity of ultimate beneficiaries. Firms registered in Britain will come under a legal obligation to obtain and hold adequate, accurate and current information on the ultimate owner who benefits from the company \u2013 and be required to place the information on a central register that would be maintained by Companies House. But in a speech to the Open Government Partnership Summit in London Cameron will surprise some business leaders by insisting the register must be open to the public as well as officials. Cameron, who will be joined on stage by the president of Tanzania, Jakaya Kikwete, and the president of Liberia, Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, will say he has won the support of important business groups to make the register public.
