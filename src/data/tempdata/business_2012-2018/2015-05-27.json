      "bodyText": "Tesco has slumped out of the world\u2019s brand premier league and been overtaken by the German discounter Aldi in the latest sign of the damage caused by a \u00a3263m accounting scandal and errors on pricing, quality and customer service. The UK\u2019s biggest retailer, ranked as the 17th most valuable global brand only five years ago, is no longer in the top 100, analysis by the research agency Millward Brown shows. Its brand value, according to the report \u2013 which balances brand power with financial performance \u2013 fell 37% in the past year. By contrast, Aldi\u2019s brand value rose 22% to $11.7bn (\u00a37.6bn), putting it 90th. Mike Dennis, an analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald, said: \u201cTesco has been tainted not just by accounting scandals but because it didn\u2019t serve the customer \u2013 it served itself.\u201d Aldi is the fastest growing grocery retailer in the UK, but is also grabbing market share from traditional retailers across Europe. Dennis said Tesco\u2019s new chief executive, the brand expert Dave Lewis, had a tough job on his hands to rebuild its reputation. He said: \u201cLewis has not only got to understand how to get the Tesco brand back at the family dining table but to understand what those people want to consume.\u201d Tesco\u2019s fate reflects a changing world market in which technology and communications brands such as Verizon and AT&amp;T have overtaken traditional consumer brands, including Coca Cola and McDonald\u2019s, to lead the rankings. At the head of the pack is Apple, which increased its brand value by 67% to $246.99bn in the past year, overtaking Google to reclaim its position as the world\u2019s most valuable brand. Millward Brown said the success of the iPhone 6 and a \u201crelentless focus on the consumer experience\u201d had put Apple back on top. A decade ago, the company was not even in the top 10. Facebook nearly doubled its brand value, leaping nine places up the world rankings to 12th as it benefited from stepping into new services and finding a way to make money from its fans\u2019 impulse to share their life stories. The rise of the tech brands took the value of the top 100 to $3.3tn, an increase of 14% in the past year. But it was not all good news for such companies. Yahoo! dropped out of the top 100 as it struggled to keep up with the trend from desktop to mobile technology and moved out of China. Twitter was the biggest faller, sliding 21 places to 92nd, closely followed by Samsung, a victim of Apple\u2019s success, which dropped 16 places to 45th. Ebay was down 12 places to 73rd. While traditional retailers such as Walmart, Ikea, H&amp;M and Zara all slipped down the rankings, Alibaba Group, the Chinese online retailer, jumped straight into 13th place \u2013 one spot ahead of its US rival Amazon \u2013 which fell four places. Alibaba floated on the New York stock exchange last year with a valuation of $187bn, and leads a rising cohort of Chinese companies in the top 100. New entrants include the telecoms firms Huawei and China Telecom, while the insurance companies China Life and Ping An joined Tencent, the business behind the mobile service WeChat and the search engine Baidu, among the biggest risers in terms of brand value. Only two categories declined \u2013 global banks and luxury goods. The brand value of the top 10 banks slipped 2% as they suffered a \u201cmassive deficit in consumer trust,\u201d according to Millward Brown\u2019s report, amid continuing revelations about misdeeds from Libor and foreign exchange market rigging to payment protection mis-selling. Michel Bergesen, a brand consultant at Landor Associates, said: \u201cThe banks shook every dimension of trust we might have had. They recovered to the point where we now have transactional trust. But I distinguish that from relational trust. I trust you to get the job done. You are part of the world\u2019s financial plumbing. But do I really trust you in the sense that I would trust.\u201d Gucci, Hermes and Louis Vuitton all fell down the rankings and Prada dropped out of the top 100 as sales growth slowed in the important Chinese market in the wake of new anti-corruption legislation. Millward Brown said: \u201cSome consumers, particularly [young people], viewed luxury products as expensive indulgences inconsistent with their desire to live in a modest and sustainable way.\u201d How does brand valuation work? Millward Brown combines financial and consumer research to quantify the worth of brands in its survey. The process starts with a calculation of earnings generated by a particular brand through analysing information from annual reports and other sources including Kantar Retail. Millward Brown then assesses the potential for future earnings as a multiple of current earnings to give a financial value to a brand, similar to that adopted by City analysts when valuing a company. The next step involves examining a brand\u2019s ability to make people pay more for an item and buy more products - its \u201cbrand contribution\u201d. This is calculated with the aid of research covering 3 million consumers and more than 100,000 brands in more than 50 markets to build up a global picture of brands, category by category and market by market. Finally, the financial value of the brand calculated by Millward Brown is multiplied by a percentage figure representing the brand contribution to calculate the value of the brand featured in the top 100 report.",

      "bodyText": "Harriet Green, a former chief executive of Thomas Cook, has agreed to donate a third of an imminent \u00a310.5m share payout to charity following an outcry over the holiday firm\u2019s actions after the deaths of two children in Corfu in 2006. Green, who quit in November 2014 but remains on the payroll until June, is due to receive 7m shares for her time at the helm. Thomas Cook has been accused of attempting to delay the inquest into the deaths of six-year-old Bobby Shepherd and sister Christi, seven, during Green\u2019s tenure. The children died from carbon monoxide poisoning, the result of fumes from a faulty boiler in their hotel room on the Greek island. At an inquest earlier this month, a verdict of unlawful killing was returned. It was also found that Thomas Cook had breached its duty of care. The tour company was slow to apologise to the family and it recently emerged that the firm received more compensation from its insurers than was given to the children\u2019s parents, Neil Shepherd and Sharon Wood. Green, a former Veuve Clicquot businesswoman of the year, joined Thomas Cook six years after the children\u2019s death and ran the business for two years, rescuing it from near bankruptcy. But she left under a cloud after allegedly alienating key staff \u2013 and was criticised last weekend by the children\u2019s mother. Wood told the Mail on Sunday: \u201cHarriet Green has behaved shamefully towards us \u2013 she refused to meet us. She should hand this bonus back or pay it to children\u2019s charities.\u201d Green was branded \u201ca greedy, shameless woman who has no sense of what the public demands in terms of accountability\u201d by Steve Hilton, a former senior advisor to David Cameron. Mary Creagh, the Labour MP who has campaigned for the family, described Green\u2019s imminent payoff as outrageous when the company \u201cbehaved so badly to the parents\u201d. Green appeared to deny claims that she refused to meet the children\u2019s parents to apologise or instigated Thomas Cook\u2019s own claim for damages over their deaths. She told Reuters: \u201cI believe that these assertions that have been made are false but I am a great believer in corporate social responsibility, in how businesses and people act, and this feels right to me. \u201cI have now reached out to the parents of Bobby and Christi Shepherd. On the basis that Thomas Cook are due to give me 7m shares in July, I have told the parents that I will donate one third of that 7m to a charity of their choice.\u201d Thomas Cook has faced a consumer backlash on social media, with thousands signing petitions calling for a boycott after the current chief executive, Peter Fankhauser, initially said there was \u201cno need to apologise\u201d because the firm was cleared of wrongdoing. He said the company had donated all the money it had received \u2013 \u00a31.5m \u2013 to Unicef while another \u00a31.5m went straight to its insurers for underwriting legal fees. However, following public pressure, Fankhauser met the children\u2019s parents last week to apologise personally. Afterwards he said the meeting \u201cshould have happened when I first took over as chief executive in November and [was] frankly something Thomas Cook should have done nine years ago.\u201d The holiday firm announced that the bungalow at the Louis Corcyra Beach Hotel in Corfu, where Bobby and Christi Shepherd died almost nine years ago, would be demolished at the parents\u2019 request. Legal representatives of the family said after the inquest that the company had \u201chidden behind a wall of silence and refused to answer any questions for almost nine years\u201d.",

Thomas Cook has been accused of attempting to delay the inquest into the deaths of six-year-old Bobby Shepherd and sister Christi, seven, during Green\u2019s tenure.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"06f1b10bb66e48185a8f9e3f8fa9b51dbba6b682\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/27/1432749589231/9d5df45d-e646-4874-9833-bdf17b37e9f6-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Harriet Green\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Harriet Green, the former chief executive of Thomas Cook.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Thomas Cook/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The children died from carbon monoxide poisoning, the result of fumes from a faulty boiler in their hotel room on the Greek island. At an inquest earlier this month, a verdict of unlawful killing was returned. It was also found that Thomas Cook had breached its duty of care.</p> <p>The tour company was slow to apologise to the family and it recently emerged that the firm received more compensation from its insurers than was given to the children\u2019s parents, Neil Shepherd and Sharon Wood.</p> <p>Green, a former Veuve Clicquot businesswoman of the year, joined Thomas Cook six years after the children\u2019s death and ran the business for two years, rescuing it from near bankruptcy. But she left under a cloud after allegedly alienating key staff \u2013 and was criticised last weekend by the children\u2019s mother. </p> <p>Wood told the Mail on Sunday: \u201cHarriet Green has behaved shamefully towards us \u2013 she refused to meet us. She should hand this bonus back or pay it to children\u2019s charities.\u201d</p> <p>Green was branded \u201ca greedy, shameless woman who has no sense of what the public demands in terms of accountability\u201d by Steve Hilton, a former senior advisor to David Cameron.</p> <p>Mary Creagh, the Labour MP who has campaigned for the family, described Green\u2019s imminent payoff as outrageous when the company \u201cbehaved so badly to the parents\u201d. </p> <p>Green appeared to deny claims that she refused to meet the children\u2019s parents to apologise or instigated Thomas Cook\u2019s own claim for damages over their deaths. She told Reuters: \u201cI believe that these assertions that have been made are false but I am a great believer in corporate social responsibility, in how businesses and people act, and this feels right to me.</p> <p>\u201cI have now reached out to the parents of Bobby and Christi Shepherd. On the basis that Thomas Cook are due to give me 7m shares in July, I have told the parents that I will donate one third of that 7m to a charity of their choice.\u201d</p> <p>Thomas Cook has faced a consumer backlash on social media, with thousands signing petitions calling for a boycott after the current chief executive, Peter Fankhauser, initially said there was \u201cno need to apologise\u201d because the firm was cleared of wrongdoing. He said the company had donated all the money it had received \u2013 \u00a31.5m \u2013 to Unicef while another \u00a31.5m went straight to its insurers for underwriting legal fees.</p> <p>However, following public pressure, Fankhauser met the children\u2019s parents last week to apologise personally. Afterwards he said the meeting \u201cshould have happened when I first took over as chief executive in November and [was] frankly something Thomas Cook should have done nine years ago.\u201d</p> <p>The holiday firm announced that the bungalow at the Louis Corcyra Beach Hotel in Corfu, where Bobby and Christi Shepherd died almost nine years ago, would be demolished at the parents\u2019 request.</p> <p>Legal representatives of the family said after the inquest that the company had \u201chidden behind a wall of silence and refused to answer any questions for almost nine years\u201d.</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Deal or no deal - markets went for the former, and moved higher on hopes that Greece was about to come to an arrangement with its creditors. Whether that was the case or not, investors decided to push shares higher anyway. The closing scores showed: The FTSE 100 ended up 84.34 or 1.21% at 7033/33 Germany\u2019s Dax added 1.26% to 11,771.13 France\u2019s Cac closed 1.95% better at 5182.53 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB rose 2.29% to 23,861.07 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 1.7% better at 11,431.1 The Athens market jumped 3.55 % to 851.81 In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 114 points or 0.s6%. On that note, it\u2019s time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. As so often, journalists in Brussels are getting a more pessimistic picture than those in Athens: Intriguing..... European Commission insiders are insisting that Greece is NOT, repeat NOT, on the brink of a deal, despite Tsipras\u2019s optimistic comments. One official has told Reuters that the remarks coming out of Athens are \u201cnonsense\u201d. Another said: \u201cI wish it were true.\u201d Reuters also has the full rebuttal from European Commission Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis. He said: \u201cWe are working very intensively to ensure a staff-level agreement. We are still not there yet.\u201d Greek optimism is driving Europe\u2019s stock markets higher and higher. The FTSE 100 index is flirting with a triple-digit jump, despite Brussels officials pouring cold water on talk of an imminent deal. Would you believe it? An EU official has denied that Greece and its creditors are working on a staff-level agreement, as that Athens official claimed an hour ago. Here\u2019s the moment that Greece\u2019s prime minister declared that the long, long awaited deal might be close.... It\u2019s official! Greece believes that it is close to a deal with its lenders. Prime minister Alexis Tsipras has just announced that the details will be presented \u2018soon\u2019, and insisted there is no danger that wages and pensions won\u2019t be paid. But Tsipras also said that Greece\u2019s creditors are divided over some issues, which surely means a deal cannot be imminent. Here are the newsflashes from Reuters: GREEK PRIME MINISTER TSIPRAS SAYS WE HAVE MADE MANY STEPS, WE ARE ON FINAL STRETCH TOWARDS POSITIVE DEAL GREEK PRIME MINISTER TSIPRAS SAYS WE WILL PRESENT DETAILS ON DEAL SOON GREEK PRIME MINISTER TSIPRAS SAYS THERE ARE STILL DIFFERENT APPROACHES AMONG LENDERS GREEK PRIME MINISTER TSIPRAS SAYS WAGES AND PENSIONS WILL BE PAID NORMALLY THIS WEEK GREEK PRIME MINISTER TSIPRAS SAYS THERE IS NO RISK TO BANK DEPOSITS Now this may be significant.... Tom Nuttall, who write the Economist\u2019s Charlemagne column from Brussels, has heard that eurozone finance minister could meet next week to sign off a Greek deal. That\u2019s only if their deputies report that there is progress, after their conference call tomorrow. Oh look! A denial, from European Commission vice-president Valdis Dombrovskis: The IMF is declining to comment on Greece\u2019s claims.... Over to Reuters for full details of these rumours of a deal that sent shares rallying in Athens. Greece says has begun drawing up agreement with creditors Greece and its creditors are starting to draft a technical-level agreement that will include no more wage or pension cuts, a government official said on Wednesday. The official said: \u201cAt the Brussels Group today procedures to draw up a staff-level agreement are beginning.\u201d The statement appeared to suggest significant progress in talks with EU and IMF creditors that form the Brussels Group, though sources close to the lenders have so far not indicated any such progress to merit drawing up an agreement. The official also cited differences between the EU and IMF as holding up an overall deal. \u201cThere remains a problem with the differing stance among the institutions. If an agreement by the IMF was not needed, the deal would have closed by now.\u201d Greek bond yields fell sharply as soon as investors heard that Greece and her creditors have, apparently, started drawing up the terms of a deal. According to this one official, the proposed agreement includes overhauling Greece\u2019s VAT tax, but avoids \u2018recessionary measures\u2019 and also confirms lower primary surplus targets. This sent the yield, or interest rate, on Greece\u2019s 10-year debt fell from 11.9% to 11.4%, meaning traders see it as less risky. The Athens stock market also jumped in the last few minutes of trading; bank shares gained 3.4%. Quite a reaction, given these comments only come from one unnamed Greek official. Especially as this official has apparently also cautioned that the IMF is holding progress up. Those upbeat comments from Athens also drove the German stock market higher..... But this optimism might not last long; let\u2019s see what Brussels makes of this talk of a deal..... Curious.... Bloomberg is quoting a Greek official saying that the two sides have started drafting a staff-level agreement; basically a deal that could be approved by eurozone ministers. However, here comes the snag.... The reports are pushing shares higher in Europe; the FTSE 100 has now gained 80 points, or 1.1%, to 7031. (that\u2019s a reference to algorithmic, or high-speed computer trading) Benedict James, banking partner at global law firm Linklaters, has warned that Greece could trigger a meltdown in its banking sector if it fails to repay the IMF \u20ac1.6bn next month: \u201cThe Greek government and Greek banks are trapped in a death embrace, with the government only appearing solvent because the Greek banks agree to roll over Greek government bonds as they mature, and the Greek banks only do that because they can use the bonds as collateral with the ECB under a facility which only works as long as the Greek government looks solvent. But if the Greek government defaults to the IMF, then the ECB will probably have withdraw the current collateralised liquidity facility, whereupon the Greek banks will be very bust. This takes us into the world of the Single Resolution Mechanism which would probably involve a massive good -bank/bad-bank split, and a huge resolution of the bad banks\u2019 assets.\u201d Time for a recap. The US government has raised the pressure on Greece and its lenders to make compromises to reach a bailout deal. Speaking at the London School of Economics, Treasury secretary Jack Lew said both sides need to drop the rhetoric, avoid brinksmanship and reach a deal quickly before an accident occurs. He warned: You have moments that come up with all too much frequency when a miscalculation could lead to the crisis that would be potentially very damaging. and also cautioned against thinking that a Greek default would be easily manageable. The notion that there is no contagion ....I think it\u2019s a mistake to think that a failure is no consequences outside of Greece. Lew is now heading to Dresden, to meet with finance ministers and central bank chiefs. Greece isn\u2019t officially on the G7 agenda, but behind the scenes it seems likely that Lew will be pushing for a resolution. In other news.... Greece has insisted that it did not seek fresh liquidity help from the European Central Bank today, because deposit outflows have stabilises. Banking insiders, though, have claimed that \u20ac300m was withdrawn on Tuesday alone, driven by fears of looming capital controls. Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras is holding a meeting with his negotiating team now, to discuss the crisis. But a meeting between Greek officials and creditors was delayed by air traffic problems in Belgium. Instead of Brussels, they\u2019ve ended up in Dusseldorf. Euro officials have warned that little progress has been made in recent days, meaning no chance of a deal before the weekend. There goes another deadline.... And economists fear that time is running out. As Christian Schulz of Berenberg bank warned: Every day of delay deepens the recession, destroys international trust, reduces bank deposits, hurts companies and increases job losses. Greece\u2019s prime minister has begun holding a meeting with his top financial advisers over the bailout crisis: Over in Dresden, the police are out in force ready for the start of the G7 meeting of finance ministers and central bank chiefs: Campaign group ONE has brought along balloons showing the faces of world leaders including David Cameron (left), Shinzo Abe (centre) and Angela Merkel (right) Those leaders aren\u2019t due in Dresden for another two weeks; the main G7 summit is on 7 and 8 June. Yesterday, ONE called on developing nations to match the UK\u2019s pledge of spending 0.7% of GDP on overseas aid to help the fight poverty. The Greek government has announced that the European Central Bank left the emergency liquidity limit unchanged today because Greek banks did not request any more money. That could calm fears that the ECB was playing hardball today, to drive Greece into a deal. Helena Smith reports from Athens: The leftist-led government announced in a statement that: \u201cThe ECB did not increase ELA because the Bank of Greece did not request an increase, as it was considered that the threshold of \u20ac80.2bn was adequate.\u201d That was because outflows had been \u201cstabilised,\u201d it added (which would not seem to chime with earlier reports about outflows accelerating). The statement also confirmed that a travel hitch delayed the 2pm start of talks by the Brussels Group, meaning the Greek team ended up 200km away in Dusseldorf: \u201cThe Brussels group work session was due to start at 2 PM. It will be delayed however because of a problem at Brussels airport which forced the plane carrying members of the Greek mission to land in Dusseldorf. The Brussels Group is important because it will handle the last things still outstanding from the agreement.\u201d Sources in the Greek banking sector have told Reuters that savers pulled more money out of Greek banks in the last week. One said: \u201cThe past week in May was more challenging compared to the previous ones in the month, with daily outflows of 200 to 300 million euros in the last few days,\u201d They also reckon around \u20ac5bn was withdrawn from Greek banks during April, up from below \u20ac2bn in March, as fears of a default grow. We get official figures from the Bank of Greece tomorrow. At the north of the eurozone, Finland\u2019s new coalition government is taking shape. Former prime minister Alex Stubb has been given the job of finance minister, meaning the right-winger will be attending eurogroup meetings where Greece\u2019s bailout is discussed. There had been speculation that eurosceptic Timo Soini would get the finance brief; instead, he\u2019s been rewarded with the foreign office. Soini is implacably opposed to any more Greek bailouts, and has called for Greece to quit the eurozone.. Here\u2019s another sign that Alexis Tsipras is taking personal responsibility for the bailout talks: Today\u2019s meeting between Greece and its creditors has apparently been delayed, because the Greek team has suffered transport problems: That must be due to the closure of Belgian airspace this morning, after an air traffic control failure. German bank Berenberg has published a scathing assessment of Greece\u2019s situation today, warning that the new government has been an \u201cunequivocal disaster\u201d. Every day of deadlock brings more pain to the Greek economy, warns senior economist Christian Schulz, who writes: Anyone following the Greek situation must be wondering, what Prime Minister Tsipras is holding out for. While the Greek economy and its financial system are increasingly at peril of a major collapse, Syriza has achieved virtually nothing in the negotiations with the troika. The key conditions for remaining \u20ac7.2bn disbursement from the second bail-out remain the same. Worse, a follow-on package is inevitable come July, and with Eurozone and IMF trust shattered, the conditions will have to be tough and the monitoring of the implementation is going to be very tight. Compared to what a hypothetically re-elected Samaras would probably have achieved, Tsipras has been an unequivocal disaster. Are things coming to a head now? Today, the ECB apparently left the ELA limit unchanged at \u20ac80.2bn. This was only the second time since February that it did so and it comes as a surprise. Deposit outflows have re-accelerated according to some Greek media reports to \u20ac300m per day from \u20ac100m as recently as last week. This may not threaten the immediate liquidity position of Greek banks, who last week were said to have an ELA buffer of \u20ac3bn. But there are two reasons for concern. (1) The minority in the ECB who are openly worried about the impact of the deepening Greek recession on Greek banks solvency seems to be growing and putting pressure on the majority to limit the risks to the institution. (2) With no clear data about banks\u2019 liquidity position available, the unchanged ELA limit could trigger more concerns by Greek households and companies about potential capital controls and thus trigger accelerated withdrawals. Greek finance minister Varoufakis may increasingly worry Greeks, too. Not just has he become a disturbing factor in the negotiations with the troika. His \u2013 swiftly denied - toying with a tax on ATM withdrawals may get people additionally worried about capital controls. In the current uncertain environment, many may believe that where there is smoke, there is also a fire. Given that a very strong minority of their governing party openly sympathise with euro exit and given that the government has made little progress in the negotiations while at the same time sinking the Greek economy back into recession, Greeks have remained remarkably sanguine about their bank deposits. After a brief spike just after the January elections, deposit outflows had normalised to relatively small amounts. However, the apparent re-acceleration of outflows could herald new depositor nervousness, potentially aggravated by the ECB and Varoufakis. That would be one way of forcing the Greek issue, alongside the government running out of money. Prime Minister Tsipras is in a very difficult situation. On the one hand, the Eurozone and the IMF will not help him deliver his impossible election promises. On the other hand, large parts of his party are not yet pragmatic enough to water down these promises and put the interest of the country above ideology. Tsipras depends on the left-wingers around energy minister Lafazanis for his job. The opposition might help him get the approval for the necessary laws in parliament to keep Greece afloat, but will demand conditions that could eventually spell the end of the Tsipras government and even his political career. It is a tough decision which Tsipras is understandably putting off. But every day of delay deepens the recession, destroys international trust, reduces bank deposits, hurts companies and increases job losses. Jack Lew has spoken with Greece\u2019s prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, by phone, according to journalist Michail Ignatiou. That\u2019s another sign that America is taking a more prominent role in the crisis. As flagged up this morning, Washington wants to calm the Greek situation to avoid the risk that Athens seeks help from Moscow, which would have a destabilising effect on Europe and the NATO alliance. While Jack Lew was urging Greece and her creditors to treat the next deadline as the last one, Bloomberg was reporting that, well, the next deadline is about to be clattered. They say: Greece will likely miss a deadline for a deal with creditors by the end of the week as the two sides have made little progress during talks in recent days, four international officials familiar with the matter said. Greece is nowhere close to an agreement with the European Commission and International Monetary Fund over the terms of a continued bailout for the country, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private negotiations. German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Francois Hollande last week set a target to reach a deal by the end of May. Matt Klein of FT Alphaville sums up Jack Lew\u2019s trip across the Atlantic: Jack Lew is covering a range of other issues during his talk at the LSE, including trade negotiations, China, and cyber-security. Fortunately Observer economics editor Heather Stewart is in the audience, tweeting all the key points: Lew also predicted that the US economy would bounce back from its slowdown last winter: But some in the audience aren\u2019t happy: It\u2019s pretty clear that Jack Lew will be banging heads together at the G7 meeting of finance ministers to get a deal on Greece. Asked if he\u2019s optimistic that a compromise will be found, the Treasury secretary tells his audience at the LSE that he always tries to be optimistic. But still, this crisis needs resolving fast, he says: Brinksmanship is a dangerous thing when it only takes one accident. Everyone has to double down, and treat the next deadline as the last deadline and get this resolved. The risk of going from deadline to deadline only increases the risks of an accident. And that\u2019s the end of the Greek questions - highlights start here. Jack Lew repeats his warning against being complacent about the risks if Greece were to default on its loans. Greece is going to have to manage to draw up a credible plan, he says,...but I\u2019ve told other parties there should be no sense that we know exactly what happens if Greece has a crisis. The notion that there is no contagion ....I think it\u2019s a mistake to think that a failure is no consequences outside of Greece. We don\u2019t know the exact scope. There is no doubt that the worst and deepest consequences would be felt in Greece, but it is \u201cprofoundly in the interest of the Europeans and the global economy\u201d that an accident is avoided, that Greece makes the moves it must make, and the institutions move with it. It sounds like Jack Lew has come to Europe to knock heads together. I\u2019ve been saying consistently that everyone must \u201cpark rhetoric on the side\u201d and find a sensible place where compromise can be found, he tells his audience at the London School for Economics [livefeed] That means Greece must to do some \u201cvery tough things which will be a challenge for the prime minister to sell at home\u201d. The institutions must look at what it will take to show there is a credible path forwards. Progress has been made, but not enough for it to be resolved. And there\u2019s always another deadline approaching. My concern isn\u2019t the goodwill of the parties, Lew continues - his big worry is an accident. You have moments that come up with all too much frequency when a miscalculation could lead to the crisis that would be potentially very damaging. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew is issuing a call to arms to resolve the Greek crisis quickly before it blows out of control. Speaking at the LSE right now, Lew says that he\u2019s sure that issue of Greece will come up when G7 finance ministers meet in Dresden for this week\u2019s meeting. Lew says that the situation is Greece is familiar, and more stable than in 2012 because more of its debt is owned by sovereigns. But still: No-one should have a false sense of confidence that they know what the result of a crisis in Greece would be. It would not be a good thing to see an economy in crisis, a run on Greece\u2019s banks, which would leave people in other countries wondering what would happen if they hit a difficult moment. It is in everyone\u2019s interest that this is resolved, Lew continues. Greece must come up with a package of credible economic reforms measures, that deals with fiscal challenges and provides structural reforms. And if it does that, the challenge for the Europeans and the IMF is to show enough flexibility to help resolve the situation safely. More to follow.... Heads-up. US Treasury Secretary Jack Lew is about to begin discussing the global economy over at the London School for Economics. He\u2019ll be setting the scene ahead of the G7 meeting in Dresden this week. There\u2019s a livefeed here. News is coming in that the European Central Bank has decided to leave Greece\u2019s emergency liquidity limit unchanged, at its current \u20ac80.2bn. Last week the ECB raised the limit by \u20ac200m, which insiders said meant Greek banks had some \u20ac3bn of wriggle-room left. So even after losing \u20ac300m of deposits yesterday, there\u2019s still some emergency funding to tide them over for a bit longer... Worried Greek savers withdrew around \u20ac300m from their accounts yesterday, more than the daily average, according to the Kathimerini newspaper. It blames worries about the IMF repayments due in June, rumours that capital controls could be imposed over the upcoming long weekend, and a suggestion that a levy could be imposed on bank withdrawals soon (this appears to be off the agenda though). It\u2019s not a full-blown panic, though. As Kathimerini puts it: Credit sector professionals reported that deposit outflows on Tuesday alone came to 300 million euros, against about 100 million euros per day in recent days. They said that while this amount is quite high, the situation is under control as citizens are remaining calm on the positive messages from Greek officials. These withdrawals leave Greece\u2019s banks increasingly dependent on the emergency liquidity doled out by the European Central Bank. The Athens stock market gained almost 1% in early trading today as fears over Greece\u2019s bailout talks recede, a little. Bank shares are among the biggest rises, pushing the ATG index towards the two-month high recorded last week. The rally suggests investors are less worried that Greece could suffer a default soon. It owes \u20ac1.6bn to the IMF next month, starting with \u20ac305m on June 5th. That payment had emerged as a hard deadline for Greece, but it now appears that it could bundle all June\u2019s obligations into a single chunky payment at the end of the month. As the WSJ explained on Monday, that would let Athens buying a bit more time and and \u2018fight to the bitter end\u2019. But it wouldn\u2019t help Greece meet the \u20ac6.7bn it owes to the European Central Bank in July and August. Ilya Spivak of DailyFX says traders will have an eye on the G7 meeting in Dresden, which runs from today until Friday. \u201cGreece is likely to feature prominently in the discussions, and traders will keep a close eye on headlines emerging from the sit-down for direction cues.\u201d The German public don\u2019t appear to be spooked by the Greek crisis. Consumer confidence in Germany has jumped to its highest level since October 2001, according to market research company GfK. It explains that: \u201cVery strong domestic demand in Germany and the low rate of inflation are fuelling economic expectations and consumers\u2019 willingness to spend.\u201d Having said that...Greece\u2019s future in the eurozone, the Ukraine crisis and the rise of the Islamic State could all dampen confidence this summer, GfK says. So are Germans being resolute, or not quite paying attention to events? Carsten Brzeski, ING Germany\u2019s chief economist, isn\u2019t quite sure..... The Greek government has told its technical staff in Brussels to \u201cclose all issues as soon as possible but without retreating from the red lines\u201d, the AMNA newswire reports. Those lines are Greece\u2019s primary surplus targets (ie, how much revenues should exceed spending, stripping out debt payments), pensions, labour market reforms, and Greek VAT rates. The Greek crisis is likely to dominate a meeting of finance ministers from the G7 industrialised nations in Eastern Germany, which begins tonight. America\u2019s Jack Lew, Germany\u2019s Wolfgang Schauble, Britain\u2019s George Osborne et al will gather in Dresden to discuss the global economy. One official told Reuters that the US delegation will push for a breakthrough in the long-running talks. \u201cThe Americans are stressing the geopolitical risks and telling us we have to find a solution, that we cannot really put the euro area and Europe at risk because of Greece.\u201d Washington fears that without aid soon, Athens could be forced to turn to Moscow for help, undermining the West\u2019s efforts to keep Vladimir Putin in check. As our unnamed official put it: \u201cIf Greece for some reason were to turn to Russia and Moscow would get involved more, they could get too much influence inside NATO and inside the EU when it comes to policies towards Russia.\u201d The London stock market is clawing back some of yesterday\u2019s losses. In early trading, the FTSE 100 has risen 29 points, after tanking by over 80 yesterday. Other European markets are also inching higher. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets says Greece\u2019s bailout deadlock send \u201cmild panic\u201d through the markets on Tuesday. As a June deadline approaches for Athens to make its next IMF repayment, both the Greek government and its creditors are scrambling to ease fears of an imminent default and potential exit from the Eurozone. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Officials from Greece and her creditors will make another attempt to hammer out a deal to unlock bailout funds today, as they sit down for negotiations in Brussels. Time is short; eurozone deputy finance ministers are due to hold a Euro Working Group teleconference on Thursday, and they\u2019d like to hear there\u2019s been some progress this week. But the two sides remain divided over key issues, including labour market reform and pension rates across Greece\u2019s battered economy. And without a breakthrough soon, it\u2019s not clear Athens can receive fresh aid before the next wave of bills start to arrive in June. Yesterday, shares across Europe fell as confidence was hit by the lack of Greek progress, and they could be edgy today unless we see some action. Investors were also alarmed by the success of left-wing parties in Spain\u2019s regional elections. Expectations that Spain\u2019s right-wing PP party will win this winter\u2019s election have been dented by the surge in support for the anti-austerity Podemos movement, and the centre-right Ciudadanos party. As Michael Hewson of CMC Markets sums up: Yesterday\u2019s sell off in European markets serves as a timely reminder that despite the recovery in the Spanish economy, politics has a nasty habit of reminding EU policymakers that away from their spreadsheets and flow charts of economic models, there is a human equation that adds an unpredictable element to all of their best laid plans. With a Spanish election coming in Q4 of this year and unemployment still at an eye wateringly high level above 20%, and youth unemployment still over 50% it seems highly improbable given last weekend\u2019s results that the incumbent government will see any benefit in the main poll later this year, unless significant inroads are made to these numbers between now and polling day. There\u2019s not much on the agenda today -- the \u2018highlight\u2019 is the Bank of Canada\u2019s interest rate decision at 3pm BST. But we\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day...",

While the Greek economy and its financial system are increasingly at peril of a major collapse, Syriza has achieved virtually nothing in the negotiations with the troika. The key conditions for remaining \u20ac7.2bn disbursement from the second bail-out remain the same. Worse, a follow-on package is inevitable come July, and with Eurozone and IMF trust shattered, the conditions will have to be tough and the monitoring of the implementation is going to be very tight. Compared to what a hypothetically re-elected Samaras would probably have achieved, Tsipras has been an unequivocal disaster.<br></p> <p><strong>Are things coming to a head now? </strong>Today, the ECB apparently left the ELA limit unchanged at \u20ac80.2bn. This was only the second time since February that it did so and it comes as a surprise. Deposit outflows have re-accelerated according to some Greek media reports to \u20ac300m per day from \u20ac100m as recently as last week. This may not threaten the immediate liquidity position of Greek banks, who last week were said to have an ELA buffer of \u20ac3bn. But there are two reasons for concern. (1) The minority in the ECB who are openly worried about the impact of the deepening Greek recession on Greek banks solvency seems to be growing and putting pressure on the majority to limit the risks to the institution. (2) With no clear data about banks\u2019 liquidity position available, the unchanged ELA limit could trigger more concerns by Greek households and companies about potential capital controls and thus trigger accelerated withdrawals. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"04de0be7ba8847a0fc120ec05276725114804e42\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/27/1432726599600/31ba792f-1d5d-4cae-ad38-711bb58ce56f-460x181.png\" alt=\"Greek bank outflows\" width=\"460\" height=\"181\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Greek finance minister Varoufakis may increasingly worry Greeks, too</strong>. Not just has he become a disturbing factor in the negotiations with the troika. His \u2013 swiftly denied - toying with a tax on ATM withdrawals may get people additionally worried about capital controls. In the current uncertain environment, many may believe that where there is smoke, there is also a fire. </p> <p><strong>Given that a very strong minority of their governing party openly sympathise with euro exit</strong> and given that the government has made little progress in the negotiations while at the same time sinking the Greek economy back into recession, Greeks have remained remarkably sanguine about their bank deposits. After a brief spike just after the January elections, deposit outflows had normalised to relatively small amounts. However, the apparent re-acceleration of outflows could herald new depositor nervousness, potentially aggravated by the ECB and Varoufakis. That would be one way of forcing the Greek issue, alongside the government running out of money. </p> <p><strong>Prime Minister Tsipras is in a very difficult situation.</strong> On the one hand, the Eurozone and the IMF will not help him deliver his impossible election promises. On the other hand, large parts of his party are not yet pragmatic enough to water down these promises and put the interest of the country above ideology. Tsipras depends on the left-wingers around energy minister Lafazanis for his job. The opposition might help him get the approval for the necessary laws in parliament to keep Greece afloat, but will demand conditions that could eventually spell the end of the Tsipras government and even his political career. It is a tough decision which Tsipras is understandably putting off. But every day of delay deepens the recession, destroys international trust, reduces bank deposits, hurts companies and increases job losses. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2015-05-27T11:43:19.866Z\">at 12.43pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5565a8ece4b0cffd86917742\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-05-27T11:25:25.317Z\">12.25pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Jack Lew has spoken with Greece\u2019s prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, by phone, according to journalist Michail Ignatiou.</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/mignatiou/statuses/603517775189921792\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"el\" dir=\"ltr\">\u0395\u03af\u03c7\u03b1\u03bc\u03b5 \u03bd\u03ad\u03bf \u03c4\u03b7\u03bb\u03b5\u03c6\u03c9\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u03b5\u03c0\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u0391\u03bc\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03ba\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03cd \u03c5\u03c0\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03b3\u03bf\u03cd \u039f\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u03b9\u03ba\u03ce\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03ba. \u03a4\u03c3\u03af\u03c0\u03c1\u03b1. \u039f\u03b9 \u0391\u03bc\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03ba\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03af \u03b1\u03bd\u03ad\u03bb\u03b1\u03b2\u03b1\u03bd \u03c4\u03b7 \u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03c0\u03c1\u03b1\u03b3\u03bc\u03ac\u03c4\u03b5\u03c5\u03c3\u03b7;</p>&mdash; Michail Ignatiou (@mignatiou) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mignatiou/status/603517775189921792\">May 27, 2015</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>That\u2019s another sign that America is taking a more prominent role in the crisis.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2015/may/27/greek-bailout-talks-resume-brussels-imf-live#block-55657023e4b05f67319af2a4\">As flagged up this morning</a>, Washington wants to calm the Greek situation to avoid the risk that Athens seeks help from Moscow, which would have a destabilising effect on Europe and the NATO alliance.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5565a695e4b04dea8dd84c2b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-05-27T11:17:49.880Z\">12.17pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>While Jack Lew was urging Greece and her creditors to<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2015/may/27/greek-bailout-talks-resume-brussels-imf-live#block-55659cd3e4b0cffd8691770d\"> treat the next deadline as the last one,</a> Bloomberg was reporting that, well, the next deadline is about to be clattered.</strong></p> <p>They say:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Greece will likely miss a deadline for a deal with creditors by the end of the week as the two sides have made little progress during talks in recent days, four international officials familiar with the matter said.</p> <p>Greece is nowhere close to an agreement with the European Commission and International Monetary Fund over the terms of a continued bailout for the country, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private negotiations.

      "bodyText": "Willie Walsh has told Ryanair that he expects the carrier to act rationally over International Airlines Group\u2019s planned \u20ac1.4bn (\u00a3990m) takeover of Aer Lingus. The chief executive of IAG, the parent of British Airways and Iberia, is close to securing control of Aer Lingus after the Irish government agreed to sell its own shareholding in the former flag carrier to the group. However, Ryanair remains a potential barrier to the takeover through its near 30% stake in Aer Lingus. Walsh said on Wednesday that IAG would make a formal offer within the next 28 days for Ryanair\u2019s shareholding and he did not expect the low-cost airline to stand in the way of a deal. \u201cI expect Ryanair to behave in a rational way, they are a well-run business with proper corporate governance in place,\u201d he said. IAG is offering Aer Lingus shareholders \u20ac2.55 in cash per share, under the proposed deal backed by the airliner\u2019s management but disputed by trade unions and opposition parties in Ireland. Ryanair, which has been ordered to sell down its Aer Lingus stake by the UK competition authority, said: \u201cOur position has not changed. The board of Ryanair has yet to receive any offer, and will consider any offer on its merits, if and when an offer is made.\u201d Speaking in Dublin on Wednesday after the Irish government gave the go-ahead for the sale of its 25% stake in Aer Lingus, the IAG boss also vowed that the Irish carrier\u2019s Heathrow-to-Ireland slots were not under threat. Walsh\u2019s assurances in the Irish Republic\u2019s capital did nothing to temper stormy scenes in the D\u00e1il, where opposition politicians accused the Fine Gael-Labour coalition of seeking to \u201cram through\u201d the sale without consulting parliament. Walsh, a Dublin-born former chief executive of Aer Lingus, insisted that the airline would still be Irish-managed and run from Dublin. \u201cAer Lingus would maintain control of its brand and operation while gaining strength as part of a profitable and sustainable airline group in an industry that\u2019s consolidating,\u201d Walsh said. \u201cAs an Irishman I\u2019m very proud \u2026 but this is not a Willie Walsh initiative; it is an IAG one,\u201d he added. He pointed out that the Dublin-Heathrow route was the second busiest intercity airlink in the world and that was why the Aer Lingus slots in London would remain. However, Walsh would not name the four extra transatlantic routes IAG was reported to have planned for Aer Lingus if the takeover completed. Walsh and IAG have said that Aer Lingus would also continue routes between Heathrow and Cork and Shannon for the next seven years, as well as retaining its distinct Irish corporate brand. However, there was anger in the D\u00e1il on Wednesday morning with accusations that the coalition had presented the parliament with a done deal before the chamber was consulted. Fianna F\u00e1il leader Micheal Martin accused the government of treating the opposition with \u201ccontempt\u201d after it cancelled the ordinary D\u00e1il business to pave the way for the Aer Lingus debate. \u201cThe manner in which the government is treating the House is bringing the House into disrepute,\u201d he said. But Ireland\u2019s transport minister, Paschal Donohoe, said the takeover would guarantee Aer Lingus\u2019s future and increase its connections to key routes around the world.",

    "webTitle": "Here\u2019s how much corporations paid US senators to fast-track the TPP bill", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A decade in the making, the controversial Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) is reaching its climax and as Congress hotly debates the biggest trade deal in a generation, its backers have turned on the cash spigot in the hopes of getting it passed. \u201cWe\u2019re very much in the endgame,\u201d US trade representative Michael Froman told reporters over the weekend at a meeting of the 21-member Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum on the resort island of Boracay. His comments came days after TPP passed another crucial vote in the Senate. That vote, to give Barack Obama the authority to speed the bill through Congress, comes as the president\u2019s own supporters, senior economists and a host of activists have lobbied against a pact they argue will favor big business but harm US jobs, fail to secure better conditions for workers overseas and undermine free speech online. Those critics are unlikely to be silenced by an analysis of the sudden flood of money it took to push the pact over its latest hurdle. Fast-tracking the TPP, meaning its passage through Congress without having its contents available for debate or amendments, was only possible after lots of corporate money exchanged hands with senators. The US Senate passed Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) \u2013 the fast-tracking bill \u2013 by a 65-33 margin on 14 May. Last Thursday, the Senate voted 62-38 to bring the debate on TPA to a close. Those impressive majorities follow months of behind-the-scenes wheeling and dealing by the world\u2019s most well-heeled multinational corporations with just a handful of holdouts. Using data from the Federal Election Commission, this chart shows all donations that corporate members of the US Business Coalition for TPP made to US Senate campaigns between January and March 2015, when fast-tracking the TPP was being debated in the Senate: Out of the total $1,148,971 given, an average of $17,676.48 was donated to each of the 65 \u201cyea\u201d votes. The average Republican member received $19,673.28 from corporate TPP supporters. The average Democrat received $9,689.23 from those same donors. The amounts given rise dramatically when looking at how much each senator running for re-election received. Two days before the fast-track vote, Obama was a few votes shy of having the filibuster-proof majority he needed. Ron Wyden and seven other Senate Democrats announced they were on the fence on 12 May, distinguishing themselves from the Senate\u2019s 54 Republicans and handful of Democrats as the votes to sway. In just 24 hours, Wyden and five of those Democratic holdouts \u2013 Michael Bennet of Colorado, Dianne Feinstein of California, Claire McCaskill of Missouri, Patty Murray of Washington, and Bill Nelson of Florida \u2013 caved and voted for fast-track. Bennet, Murray, and Wyden \u2013 all running for re-election in 2016 \u2013 received $105,900 between the three of them. Bennet, who comes from the more purple state of Colorado, got $53,700 in corporate campaign donations between January and March 2015, according to Channing\u2019s research. Almost 100% of the Republicans in the US Senate voted for fast-track \u2013 the only two non-votes on TPA were a Republican from Louisiana and a Republican from Alaska. Senator Rob Portman of Ohio, who is the former US trade representative, has been one of the loudest proponents of the TPP. (In a comment to the Guardian Portman\u2019s office said: \u201cSenator Portman is not a vocal proponent of TPP - he has said it\u2019s still being negotiated and if and when an agreement is reached he will review it carefully.\u201d) He received $119,700 from 14 different corporations between January and March, most of which comes from donations from Goldman Sachs ($70,600), Pfizer ($15,700), and Procter &amp; Gamble ($12,900). Portman is expected to run against former Ohio governor Ted Strickland in 2016 in one of the most politically competitive states in the country. Seven Republicans who voted \u201cyea\u201d to fast-track and are also running for re-election next year cleaned up between January and March. Senator Johnny Isakson of Georgia received $102,500 in corporate contributions. Senator Roy Blunt of Missouri, best known for proposing a Monsanto-written bill in 2013 that became known as the Monsanto Protection Act, received $77,900 \u2013 $13,500 of which came from Monsanto. Arizona senator and former presidential candidate John McCain received $51,700 in the first quarter of 2015. Senator Richard Burr of North Carolina received $60,000 in corporate donations. Eighty-one-year-old senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa, who is running for his seventh Senate term, received $35,000. Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, who will be running for his first full six-year term in 2016, received $67,500 from pro-TPP corporations. \u201cIt\u2019s a rare thing for members of Congress to go against the money these days,\u201d said Mansur Gidfar, spokesman for the anti-corruption group Represent.Us. \u201cThey know exactly which special interests they need to keep happy if they want to fund their reelection campaigns or secure a future job as a lobbyist. \u201cHow can we expect politicians who routinely receive campaign money, lucrative job offers, and lavish gifts from special interests to make impartial decisions that directly affect those same special interests?\u201d Gidfar said. \u201cAs long as this kind of transparently corrupt behavior remains legal, we won\u2019t have a government that truly represents the people.\u201d This article was amended on 28/5/15 to include a comment from senator Rob Portman.",

      "body": "<p>The chief executive of the world\u2019s largest oil company will on Wednesday face two of the firm\u2019s most persistent environmental activist shareholders \u2013 a nun from New Jersey and a friar from Milwaukee.</p> <p>ExxonMobil boss Rex Tillerson has a long history of civil but strained sparring with <a href=\"http://www.michaelcrosby.net/\">Father Michael Crosby</a> and Sister Pat Daly at its annual shareholder meetings. Crosby is leading a group of investors calling for Exxon to give a seat on its board to an eminent climate expert, while Daly is pressing for emission targets that would set the company on the the path away from fossil fuels. </p> <p>All this is taking place against a backdrop of mounting external pressure on the oil group that makes the confrontation at this year\u2019s gathering in Dallas, Texas, especially significant. It comes just weeks after Exxon dispatched a lobbyist and a planning executive to Rome in an attempt to brief the Vatican on global warming. Pope Francis is shortly to publish his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/12/pope-environmental-sinners-will-face-god-judgment\">encyclical on the environment</a>, which could make uncomfortable reading for many in the oil and gas industry.<br></p> <p>In a letter to shareholders before the Dallas meeting, Tillerson and his fellow directors recommended voting against Crosby\u2019s resolution. They argued: \u201cTo set aside one seat for an environmental specialist or for any single attribute or area of expertise would, in our view, not be in the best interests of the company or its shareholders because it would dilute the breadth needed by all directors to make informed decisions for the company.\u201d<br></p> <p>Crosby\u2019s resolution has won the backing of influential investor advisory group ISS, which is recommending its members support the proposal.

      "bodyText": "The chief executive of the world\u2019s largest oil company will on Wednesday face two of the firm\u2019s most persistent environmental activist shareholders \u2013 a nun from New Jersey and a friar from Milwaukee. ExxonMobil boss Rex Tillerson has a long history of civil but strained sparring with Father Michael Crosby and Sister Pat Daly at its annual shareholder meetings. Crosby is leading a group of investors calling for Exxon to give a seat on its board to an eminent climate expert, while Daly is pressing for emission targets that would set the company on the the path away from fossil fuels. All this is taking place against a backdrop of mounting external pressure on the oil group that makes the confrontation at this year\u2019s gathering in Dallas, Texas, especially significant. It comes just weeks after Exxon dispatched a lobbyist and a planning executive to Rome in an attempt to brief the Vatican on global warming. Pope Francis is shortly to publish his encyclical on the environment, which could make uncomfortable reading for many in the oil and gas industry. In a letter to shareholders before the Dallas meeting, Tillerson and his fellow directors recommended voting against Crosby\u2019s resolution. They argued: \u201cTo set aside one seat for an environmental specialist or for any single attribute or area of expertise would, in our view, not be in the best interests of the company or its shareholders because it would dilute the breadth needed by all directors to make informed decisions for the company.\u201d Crosby\u2019s resolution has won the backing of influential investor advisory group ISS, which is recommending its members support the proposal. Earlier Exxon had attempted to get the measure struck off the meeting agenda on technical grounds, but were overruled by the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Separately, Daly is leading a group of activist shareholders calling on Exxon to come up with a plan to cut its greenhouse gas emissions \u2013 not just emissions from extraction and refinement processes, but also from Exxon fuel products. This resolution effectively calls on the group to set out a timeframe for a transition to becoming a non-carbon energy group, phasing out fossil fuels.

Last year it received the support of 22% of investors and is expected to perform strongly again on Wednesday.

AOn Wednesday, colleagues of Daly will present a substantially identical resolution on greenhouse gas emissions at a shareholder meeting convened by fellow oil company Chevron. Another resolution at that meeting, led by activists at As You Sow, calls for Chevron to slash its capital spending on big projects to develop reserves, instead returning it to shareholders. The Guardian published on Monday its analysis of capital spending at the big five oil companies. It found $1tn (\u00a30.64tn) had been paid out over nine years by the Exxon, Shell, Chevron, BP and Total. Annual spending doubled, before dipping back slightly last year, though remaining at historically high levels. In its letter to shareholders ahead of the meeting, the Chevron board said the proposal to cut capital spending \u201cis based on a flawed, if not dangerous, premise: that stockholders would be best served if Chevron stopped investing in its business\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "Paddy Power is quoting 11/10 on Greece leaving the euro \u2013 and after recent events it\u2019s hardly a surprise that the bookmaker is offering the shortest odds ever on a Grexit. After months of wrangling, Greece still can\u2019t reach an agreement with its creditors to secure fresh financial assistance and doesn\u2019t have the ready cash to make a payment due to the International Monetary Fund at the end of next week. The economic argument for Greece staying in the euro is weak. National output is down by a quarter in five years. The debt-to-GDP ratio is heading rapidly towards 200%. One in four people are unemployed and there is widespread poverty. Demands from Greece\u2019s creditors for more austerity is, in these circumstances, inhumane and economically crass. If Greece was not a member of the euro, but rather a struggling country in sub-Saharan Africa, the IMF remedy would be devaluation, debt relief and a welfare safety net to protect the most vulnerable. So when the Greek finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, rails against the stupidity of what is being demanded in return for the dubious privilege of staying in the euro, he is absolutely right. The problem, though, is that Greece wants to remain a member of the single currency while ending austerity \u2013 and that is not an option. All the opinion polls say that there is little appetite for a return to the drachma. Politically, Greece likes the idea of being part of Europe. That means it is crunch time for Alexis Tsipras. Greece\u2019s prime minister has to decide whether he is prepared to accept more austerity as the price of remaining in the single currency. The mood music suggests that he is. Tsipras is now in personal control of the negotiations and has sidelined Varoufakis. He has won the backing of the Syriza coalition to press on with the talks. Tsipras is playing a bad hand well. It is in his interests to maintain the sense that the minutes are ticking away to the moment when Greece goes bust and throws the rest of Europe into a fresh crisis. That prospect might just secure him slightly better terms from the so-called troika \u2013 the IMF, the European Central Bank and the EU. It will certainly make it easy to sell a surrender to the Greek people. For, make no mistake, that is a far likelier outcome than Greece leaving the euro. The odds being offered by Paddy Power are not generous. Not a patient success Two surveys, two competing views of the state of British industry. The good news, according to the consultancy firm EY, is that the UK has cemented its place as Europe\u2019s favourite destination for manufacturing inward investment. Almost 900 new projects were recorded in 2014, up 11% on the previous year. Britain increased its market share for direct foreign investment projects to just over 20%, leaving Germany for dead. The results for the automotive sector were especially strong. The bad news is that while Britain has an impressive record for assembling cars for foreign-owned companies, the record for developing its own world-beating products is not so hot. According to a Thomson-Reuters innovation study of 12 industrial sectors, the UK issued 6619 patents last year. That was barely a tenth of what Germany managed. France, derided by George Osborne for its poor growth and unemployment record, managed 5000 more patents than the UK. So which is it? Is Britain the place where the world now likes to do business? Or is it still the country that leaves far too many brilliant ideas in the university labs and engineering departments? The answer is both. Foreign-owned companies like Britain for a number of reasons: taxes are low, labour is cheap, English is spoken, and access to the European Union is guaranteed. Inward investment has become a form of industrial policy. Governments woo foreign companies with the offer of tax breaks and a greenfield site on which to build their factory, and don\u2019t worry too much when the profits go overseas. The Thomson-Reuters survey shows three things. It demonstrates the damage caused by the hollowing out of industry since the 1970s. In some of the 12 sectors covered, Britain has no patents because it has no real presence any more. Secondly, in sectors such as automotives, where production is booming, the innovation is being done somewhere else. The top five auto innovators as measured by patents were all German. Finally, Britain\u2019s assembly-plant model of manufacturing would be vulnerable if, for any reason, foreign-owned companies decided to leave.",
