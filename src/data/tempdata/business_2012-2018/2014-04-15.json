A superbubble. Property prices out of control. </b>These are some of the reactions to figures showing that <b>London house prices rose 17.7% in the year to February 2014</b>. Soaring demand for a pile of bricks and mortar in the capital has pushed up average UK house prices<a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/hpi/house-price-index/february-2014/stb-february-2014.html#tab-House-Price-Index-UK-Summary\"> by 9.1% over the year to February 2014</a>. </p> <p><b>Sam Bowman, research director of the Adam Smith Institute, argues that London's house prices are out of control.</b><br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This is a disaster \u2013 the housing market is out of control, particularly in London, making housing increasingly unaffordable for many people, particularly the poor and young. Rising house prices are nice if you own your own home and are planning on downsizing or want to leave your house to your children, but if you want to get onto the property ladder or move to a larger home, say, to start a family, the price rises revealed by today\u2019s news are devastating. Rents are rising more slowly than house prices but it seems likely that eventually they will catch up, particularly for short-term leases.<br></p> <p>Help to Buy is likely to be one factor in these price rises, because the scheme inflates demand by subsidising home buying. And if house prices fall, the taxpayer will take the hit. </p> <p>But the biggest cause of these runaway train price rises is the planning system, which makes it inordinately difficult for new construction to take place to allow supply to meet demand. Since 2008, issuance of construction permits for residential buildings has been at a fifty-year low.</p> <p>Unless the government liberalises planning radically to allow a huge amount of new house construction, house prices are likely to stay high for the foreseeable future.</p> </blockquote> <p><b>Oliver Atkinson, director of the online estate agents </b><b>Urbansalesandlettings.co.uk, </b>describes the capital as a superbubble.<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Annual growth of nearly 18% is the biggest figure since July 2007 and underlines the exceptional rate of growth in the capital.</p> <p>Will the superbubble go pop? The extreme lack of supply in the capital will protect prices to an extent but anyone buying at current levels has to go in with eyes wide open.</p> <p>It\u2019s worrying that first time buyers are now paying 10.5% more on average than they were a year ago. Their exposure is increasing by the day. If the market moves against them, many could be left very quickly in a negative equity situation.</p> <p>What's now very clear is that the overall UK house price picture is being distorted materially by London and the South East...The property markets in Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland and the North of England bear little relation to those of London and the South East.</p> </blockquote> <p>But <b>housing minister Kris Hopkins</b> insists that the government is on the path of \"long-term economic stability and growth\".</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Mortgage lending activity in the housing market remains below the historic average and relative to earnings, median house prices across England are around the same level they were in 2005.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2014-04-15T10:27:34.886Z\">at 11.27am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-534cfe84e4b07c34eebba5ac\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-04-15T09:54:12.754Z\">10.54am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><b>Labour says the government would be \"out of touch\" to tell people that the cost of living crisis is over.</b></p> <p>Here is <b>Shabana Mahmood, Labour\u2019s Shadow Treasury minister,</b> in response to the inflation data.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>At long last it looks like average wages will soon be rising faster than CPI inflation.

We will also have an update on the public finances, plus a slew of corporate results, including Tesco. In the US, the Federal Reserve releases its beige book on economic conditions around the country. That's all for today. Thank you for following and all your comments. For the diary: we are awaiting a verdict in the trial of three directors of the failed Anglo Irish bank. Jurors began a third day of deliberations this morning. Sean FitzPatrick, Pat Whelan and William McAteer have pleaded not guilty to charges that they unlawfully provided finance to 16 individuals including Sean Quinn, once Ireland's richest man. The BBC has produced this useful Q&amp;A on the trial, which is already one of the longest in Irish history. The Federal Reserve has published the full text of Janet Yellen's speech (and video link) here. The US Federal Reserve has warned that US banks and other Wall St firms may need to carry more capital to avert stability risks. Fed chair Janet Yellen praised new liquidity standards for global banking firms, but warned they do not apply to so-called shadow banks or to the financial system as a whole. The internationally adopted standards that will require lenders to hold separate buffers of cash and bonds do not fully address the financial stability concerns associated with short-term wholesale funding. This could mean further regulation from the Fed, she said. Federal Reserve staff are actively considering additional measures that could address these and other residual risks in the short-term wholesale funding markets. Not only does she want bank reforms to bolster capital but also to ensure liquidity, to avoid a re-run of Northern Rock or Lehman Brothers. In 2007 and 2008, short-term creditors ran from firms such as Northern Rock, Bear Stearns, and Lehman Brothers, and from money market mutual funds and asset-backed commercial paper programs. Together, these runs were the primary engine of a financial crisis from which the United States and the global economy have yet to fully recover I've taken the quotes from Reuters and Bloomberg. Gold prices might be sliding, but China's love for the previous metal shows no sign of abating: demand is expected to increase by 20% over the next four years as consumers become more affluent, according to the World Gold Council. Last year China overtook India as the world's biggest customer for gold, accounting for just over a quarter of global private sector gold demand. The traditional appeal of gold to the Chinese people and consumers\u2019 optimistic outlook for prices should result in private sector demand from all sources climbing to at least 1,350t by 2017. As well as this nice infographic, the Council report has lots of facts and figures tracing the history of Chinese interest in gold back to the Communist ban on bullion in 1950. The devastating effects of the economic crisis in Spain show no sign of letting up, with figures showing that it has more unemployment blackspots than any of its European neighbours. Here is Guardian reporter Stephen Burgen in Barcelona Only a day after Spain\u2019s second biggest bank predicted that it will take another 10 years for employment to return to 2007 levels, more grim statistics reveal the devastation of Spain labour force, of whom almost 6 million are jobless. Today\u2019s Eurostat figures show that Spanish regions occupy 7 of the EU\u2019s top 10 unemployment blackspots. The top five are all in Spain, two are in Macedonia and the remainder is the French colony Reuni\u00f3n. All of the top five have jobless rates of over 33%, led by Andalusia at 36.3%. The region, home to the Costa del Sol, receives some 7 million tourists every year but has been hard it by the slump in construction and the falling price of olive oil, the region\u2019s main export. Of the 27 regions that reported unemployment above 21%, 13 are in Spain, 10 in Greece, one in Italy, as well as three French outposts. Of the 49 regions with jobless rates of 5.4% or lower, 23 are in Germany, 8 in Austria, 3 in the Czech Republic, followed by Romania (3), Belgium (2), Holland (1) and Italy (1). The boss of BP has repeated that the company will stand by its Russian investments. Speaking in Moscow, Bob Dudley said western sanctions had not had an impact on BP's business. The company owns a 20% stake in Russia's state-energy giant Rosneft, which is led by Igor Sechin, a long-standing ally of Vladimir Putin. We are rock solid with out investments in Rosneft and will stand by our investments. This echoes the business as usual message from BP at its AGM last week.\ufeff BP might escape damage for now, as the US, which has so far taken a tougher line than the EU, does not appear to be minded to target entire sections of the Russian economy, such as mining, banking and energy. One source told Reuters: Broad sectoral sanctions are probably not up for immediate action. What is up for immediate action is ... (Russian) individuals and entities. All of this is subject to what is happening on the ground. No sign of the price war between the UK supermarkets in today's inflation figures. Tesco, Asda and Morrisons have together pledged to knock \u00a32.4 billion off prices to compete with fast-growing discounters Aldi and Lidl. But food was not a significant driver of declining inflation says the Guardian's Sarah Butler. It is the season of the annual general meeting. Today is turn of mining giant Rio Tinto, which is facing protests over its environmental and safety record. The latest challenge centres on a uranium mine the company owns in Namibia, where former workers have developed lung diseases and other unknown illnesses linked to their work. The Guardian's environment editor John Vidal reports that the miners were digging uranium ore to supply the British and US military in the 1970s. The mine, in the Namib desert, produces around 7% of the world's uranium but was operated with rudimentary safety when it opened in 1976. \"People get sick. We are seeing it in people that have worked for R\u00f6ssing for a long time. They just go back and die after working at R\u00f6ssing,\" one man told researchers working with Earthlife Namibia and the Labour Resource and Research Institute. A spokesman for Rio Tinto said the mine was recognised as one of the world's safest. You can read the full report here. Over in London, the AGM has been running for almost an hour. Chairman Jan du Plessis has talked up the company in a bid to quell investor concern over worse-than-expected iron ore production. The company has faced protests about how it treats workers and indigenous communities, both outside (and by the sounds of it) inside the hall. Turning to Germany, a poll shows business confidence is weakening, as the Ukraine crisis frays investor nerves. The ZEW Indicator of economic sentiment - a monthly poll of investors and analysts - slipped for the fourth month in a row. After the latest fall of 3.4 points, it now stands at 43.2 points, which is still high against the historical average of 24.6 points. Zew analysts said uncertainty caused by the Ukraine conflict was making investors more cautious. Carsten Brzeski at ING Bank provides the context - and a warning: The geopolitical conflict close to Germany\u2019s backyard, concerns about the Chinese economy and the recent equity market correction have clearly dented investors\u2019 optimism. After the excellent start to the year, the German economy is now starting to feel some headwinds .. Today\u2019s ZEW index sends two messages, which perfectly characterise the current state of the German economy. The economy had an excellent start to the new year, gaining new momentum. However, with the Ukraine crisis, Chinese uncertainties and emerging markets slowing down more and more gusts of wind, particularly from the East, could easily disturb real spring fever on the island of happiness. For further reading on German-Russian relations, Der Spiegel has a fascinating piece on how German policymakers misread Russia. The Germans' romantic image of the Russians is to be blamed for Berlin's misguided policies toward the country and for the fact that the Kremlin is no longer inclined to take us seriously. \ufeffRead the full article here. Another warning of \"out of control\" house prices comes from Shelter. Here is chief executive Campbell Robb: Today\u2019s figures are yet more evidence that house prices are spiralling out of control. Apart from the lucky few who can rely on the bank of mum and dad, our runaway housing market is forcing a generation to watch a home of their own become an increasingly distant dream, no matter how hard they work or save. Instead of the housing minister welcoming yet another house price rise, we need to see the government commit to concrete plans that will close the ever expanding gap between the homes we have and the homes we need. This is the only way to put the brakes on our rollercoaster housing market, and give a generation of priced out young people and families the chance of a stable home. A bubble. A superbubble. Property prices out of control. These are some of the reactions to figures showing that London house prices rose 17.7% in the year to February 2014. Soaring demand for a pile of bricks and mortar in the capital has pushed up average UK house prices by 9.1% over the year to February 2014. Sam Bowman, research director of the Adam Smith Institute, argues that London's house prices are out of control. This is a disaster \u2013 the housing market is out of control, particularly in London, making housing increasingly unaffordable for many people, particularly the poor and young. Rising house prices are nice if you own your own home and are planning on downsizing or want to leave your house to your children, but if you want to get onto the property ladder or move to a larger home, say, to start a family, the price rises revealed by today\u2019s news are devastating. Rents are rising more slowly than house prices but it seems likely that eventually they will catch up, particularly for short-term leases. Help to Buy is likely to be one factor in these price rises, because the scheme inflates demand by subsidising home buying. And if house prices fall, the taxpayer will take the hit. But the biggest cause of these runaway train price rises is the planning system, which makes it inordinately difficult for new construction to take place to allow supply to meet demand. Since 2008, issuance of construction permits for residential buildings has been at a fifty-year low. Unless the government liberalises planning radically to allow a huge amount of new house construction, house prices are likely to stay high for the foreseeable future. Oliver Atkinson, director of the online estate agents Urbansalesandlettings.co.uk, describes the capital as a superbubble. Annual growth of nearly 18% is the biggest figure since July 2007 and underlines the exceptional rate of growth in the capital. Will the superbubble go pop? The extreme lack of supply in the capital will protect prices to an extent but anyone buying at current levels has to go in with eyes wide open. It\u2019s worrying that first time buyers are now paying 10.5% more on average than they were a year ago. Their exposure is increasing by the day. If the market moves against them, many could be left very quickly in a negative equity situation. What's now very clear is that the overall UK house price picture is being distorted materially by London and the South East...The property markets in Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland and the North of England bear little relation to those of London and the South East. But housing minister Kris Hopkins insists that the government is on the path of \"long-term economic stability and growth\". Mortgage lending activity in the housing market remains below the historic average and relative to earnings, median house prices across England are around the same level they were in 2005. Labour says the government would be \"out of touch\" to tell people that the cost of living crisis is over. Here is Shabana Mahmood, Labour\u2019s Shadow Treasury minister, in response to the inflation data. At long last it looks like average wages will soon be rising faster than CPI inflation. But after four years when wages have fallen sharply in real terms, a huge turnaround is needed to ensure people aren\u2019t worse off than when David Cameron came to office. Real wages have fallen by \u00a31,600 a year since 2010 and, on top of this, tax and benefit changes will see the average household \u00a31000 a year worse off by next year. It would be deeply complacent and out of touch for ministers to try and tell people the cost-of-living crisis is over on the basis of one or two statistics. We have a deep-seated cost-of-living crisis which is about insecurity at work, the prospects for the next generation and the broken link between the wealth of the nation and family finances. While the Tories deny it even exists, Labour has a clear plan to deal with the cost-of-living crisis and earn our way to higher living standards for all, not just a few at the top.\" This reprises the argument of Ed Balls in the Guardian today. This is now set to be the first time in living memory when people are worse off at the end of the parliament than they were at the beginning. At the next election, the answer to Ronald Reagan's famous question: \"Are you better off than you were four years ago?\" \u2013 looks likely to be a resounding no. No wonder David Cameron and George Osborne are desperate for Labour to stop talking about this issue. The TUC says those who cheer the latest inflation data are out of touch with the lives of ordinary people. TUC General Secretary Frances O\u2019Grady said: Workers are now \u00a340 a week worse off than before the crash. Those waiting to hail the first month in which wages creep higher than prices as recovery will show how out of touch they are with the lives of ordinary people, especially on a measure of prices that does not include housing costs. A real recovery will deliver rising real wages that recover spending power lost since the crash and generate decent jobs with good pay, security and prospects. That remains a distant prospect. I haven't seen any reaction from Labour to the inflation data, but Capital Economics is ready to declare the earnings squeeze over. Here is Samuel Tombs, UK economist at Capital Economics. March\u2019s UK inflation figures suggest that the six-year squeeze on real earnings is finally over. [Consumer Price Index] inflation fell from 1.7% in February to 1.6%, the lowest rate seen since October 2009. Since annual growth in average earnings was 1.7% in January, and has probably strengthened since, consumers\u2019 pay is finally rising again in real terms (on the CPI measure at least). The Capital Economics team forecast that a combination of stable commodity prices, falling import prices and recovering productivity will push CPI inflation as low as 1% before the year is out. This would provide more solid foundations for the recovery in consumer spending and enable the [Montary Policy Committee at the Bank of England] to keep Bank Rate at 0.5% until late 2015. It was only a matter of time before someone said \"hardworking families\". The prime minister got there first. The fall in inflation is heralded as good news by economists, who are expecting growth in earnings to be revealed tomorrow in another data set. James Knightley at ING Bank says the most important story is what is happening to real wages. With the economy having created over a million new jobs since 2010, the pool of available labour continues to shrink so wages are likely to continue rising. This will put more money in the pockets of workers, with an increase in the tax free personal allowance set to help further. It may take a while for households to really feel this, but it should make it more likely that consumer spending can grow strongly. In turn, this makes it more likely that 3% GDP growth rates can be recorded in the next couple of years. While many are focused on tomorrow's wage figures, Howard Archer at IHS Global Insight says earnings growth is already outstripping prices. In fact, with latest data showing that headline average earnings growth was up to 1.7% in January itself (and up to 1.9% in the private sector alone), earnings are now running above inflation for the first time since briefly doing so in early-2010. He thinks inflation could rise in April, as Easter travel spending percolates through the economy. Earnings growth, however, will strengthen only gradually. Underlying price pressures should be limited for some time to come. While GDP growth is seen coming in at 2.8% in 2014, this should not lead to any marked pick up in underlying inflationary pressures given the slack in the economy after extended very weak economic activity.Earnings growth is seen strengthening relatively gradually during 2014 reflecting still appreciable labour market slack and likely only a limited pick up in productivity in the near term from recent low levels. Jeremy Cook, chief economist at World First, said the latest figures mean banks are unlikely to raise interest rates anytime soon. Developed market economies \u2013 US, UK, the Eurozone, Switzerland, Sweden \u2013 are all experiencing periods of sub-trend inflation at the moment, lessening the pressure on consumers as it falls, given recent encouraging wage dynamics... Rate expectations have got ahead of themselves in recent months in the UK and a lower inflation picture will complement the banks wariness of raising rates to early. This in keeping with a central bank policy that has shifted from a more quantitative form of forward guidance to a more qualitative, holistic view. Here is a round-up of some of the best early reaction on Twitter to the latest ONS data Chancellor George Osborne has welcomed the inflation numbers, but said more needs to be done to fix the economy. These latest inflation numbers are welcome news for families. Lower inflation and rising job numbers show our long term plan is working, and bringing greater economic security. But there is still much more we need to do to build the resilient economy I spoke of at the budget. So, inflation down, manufacturing prices down, but house prices are still roaring ahead. Here are some of the headline numbers from the Office for National Statistics inflation data: The Consumer Prices Index (CPI) grew by 1.6% in the year to March 2014, down from 1.7% in February. The largest contribution to the fall in the rate came from transport, particularly motor fuels. Other smaller downward effects came from the clothing and furniture &amp; household goods sectors. The output price index for goods produced by UK manufacturers (factory gate prices), rose 0.5% in the year to March, compared with a rise of 0.6% in the year to February. UK house prices increased by 9.1% in the year to February 2014, up from 6.8% in the year to January 2014. House price annual inflation grew by 9.7% in England, 5.3% in Wales, 2.4% in Scotland and 2.8% in Northern Ireland. House price growth is increasing strongly across most parts of the UK, with prices in London again showing the highest growth. Annual house price increases in England were driven by rises in London (17.7%), the South East (8.0%) and the East of England (7.7%). You can see the full data set here. Breaking news: UK inflation fell to 1.6% in March , its lowest level in more than four years. Ahead of inflation data at 9.30, Capital Economics has an interesting take on how the recovering economy could spell an improvement in the UK's weak productivity. Roger Bootle, managing director of Capital Economics, thinks that real pay rises will soon return to their historic norm of 2%. Here is the key extract from his Daily Telegraph article: Once exports pick up \u2013 which is largely dependent upon the world economy, and in particular on the eurozone \u2013 then as manufacturing rises as a share of GDP, so the rate of productivity growth should also rise. But more important than this will be the pace of innovation and technological change. I just don\u2019t buy the argument that it has slowed sharply. People have been repeatedly saying that for the past 200 years. I suspect that what we are about to witness is a period in which real pay rises at an increasing rate and before long it will be back to rates close to the historical norm of 2pc. That would have a major impact on the political debate. Read the article in full here. Here are some of the most interesting articles on business and the global economy that jumped out at me from today's papers. China engineers \u2018Potemkin defaults\u2019 to mask debt reality. Jamil Anderlini in the FT (metred paywall) explores why the Chinese government \"is trying desperately to manufacture some high-profile model defaults\". Teetering Russian economy faces cash crisis over Ukraine. Ambrose Evans-Pritchard in the Daily Telegraph reports that Western companies' \"self sanctions\" are going beyond EU and US requirements. Ukraine crisis: this does not feel like a doomsday scenario \u2013 or not yet. The Guardian's Larry Elliott looks at how Ukraine could affect the global economy. Glaxo finds itself on the back foot again as pharma giant is hit by new scandal. Alex Brummer of the Daily Mail suggests GSK chief executive Andrew Witty should give up his bonus until the pharmaceutical firm puts bribery allegations behind it. Co-op's would-be saviour turns on critics. Speaking to Miles Costello and Andrew Clark in the Times (paywall), the former Labour minister Lord Myners tells hits back at his detractors in the Co-op and says it needs \"a proper board of competent people\". A senior Bank of England official has said British businesses are investing more as the economy recovers. Speaking on BBC Radio Lancashire, Ben Broadbent, who will become deputy governor in July, said there was growth in \"pretty much every sector\". [Businesses] are prepared to make the investment decisions that they wouldn't have done two or three years ago when they were worried about whether growth was going to return, what was going to happen in the eurozone and so forth. Via Reuters Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and the business world. Is the cost of living squeeze over? Official data published today is expected to show that inflation has fallen to its lowest level in nearly four and a half years, boosting consumer spending power. The ONS data out this morning is likely to show that the consumer price index dropped to 1.6% in March, from 1.7% in February. This comes just ahead of annual wage growth figures on Wednesday that are likely to show 1.8% growth in the three months to February. The difference - 0.1 or 0.2% depending on the forecast- is barely more than a rounding error, but as economists are saying: \u2018every journey of 1,000 miles starts with a single step\u2019. Here is Alan Clarke at Scotiabank Falling real wages has been a significant drag on the overall economic recovery in recent years, holding back consumers' purchasing power. That said, falling real incomes didn't get in the way of robust consumer spending growth over the last year. Household spending growth outpaced income growth as consumers saved less (or borrowed more) \u2013 encouraged by the buoyancy of the housing market. That boost from the housing market won't last for ever, so it is encouraging that rising real incomes should be an ongoing driving force behind consumers spending, even after the sugar rush from the housing market has become exhausted. The Guardian\u2019s economics reporter Katie Allen tells the story here in charts. Plenty else is afoot this morning, with more sanctions against Russia threatened by the US and EU, although full details have yet to emerge. On the UK corporate front, grim news for department store Debenhams, which has posted a 25% fall in profits. We are expecting inflation at 9.30. I\u2019ll be following that and all the latest. ..",

      "standfirst": "A proposed scheme can help central bankers target financial overheating and minimise impact on productive investment", 
      "body": "<p>After years of denial central banks are finally coming around to recognise that they must take responsibility for asset bubbles that can wreak economic havoc. Executive director of the Bank of England Andrew Haldane highlighted this earlier this month when he stated that managing the asset managers would \"require fresh thinking on new policy tools\".</p> <p>But this ties into a far broader problem; namely, how should central banks counteract dangerous pressures in financial markets without generating substantial instability in the real economy?</p> <p>The problem is that central banks must rely primarily on monetary policy to exert control over asset markets. Yes, regulation plays an important role but, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-26680993\" title=\"\">as the late great Hyman Minsky taught us</a>, the financial system is highly adaptive and central bankers require a cooling valve when they see markets getting too hot.</p> <p>Unfortunately, if central bankers want to put the markets on ice they have to raise short-term interest rates. If they are pushed to raise these rates too high this can lead to a recession as lending dries up and real investment, as opposed to purely financial investment, crawls to a halt.</p> <p>What central bankers need is a policy tool that can target financial overheating directly while minimising the impact the policy has on real, productive investment. The US economist Thomas Palley has provided just that in his new paper <a href=\"http://www.thomaspalley.com/?p=416\" title=\"\">Monetary Policy After Quantitative Easing: The Case for Asset Based Reserve Requirements</a> (ABRR).</p> <p>The way that monetary policy works today is that private banks are required to hold a given amount of reserves \u2013 that is, cash balances at the central bank \u2013 for every loan they extend. The central bank then extends these reserves to the private banking system to set the overnight interest rate at which the banks lend. Palley's ingenious idea is that central banks place reserve requirements on the holdings of assets.</p> <p>In such a scheme there would be additional reserve requirements for each asset class. So, there would be separate reserve requirements for stocks, bonds, mortgage securities and so on. The central bank could set these requirements at zero initially and then when they saw instability being generated in any given market they would raise the reserve requirements on that asset class. This would increase the cost of holding this type of asset and drive up the interest rate on it without directly affecting interest rates in the rest of the system.</p> <p>An example might be instructive. Imagine that the central bank was concerned that the housing market was overheating. But at the same time the level of investment in the economy was not sufficient to generate general price inflation. The central bank could then raise reserve requirements on new mortgage issues. This would subdue over enthusiastic speculators in the housing market while leaving borrowing rates for those engaged in real, productive investment unchanged.</p> <p>Palley points out in his paper, however, that the success of such a policy would be tied to which types of financial institutions were included in the new regulations. Ideally, the asset-based reserve requirements would have to be placed on the whole financial system. That would include not just commercial banks, but also shadow banks and financial intermediaries. This does not seem to me much of a problem, however, because regulators today are increasingly interested in bringing these new types of financial institutions into the regulatory fold and Palley's proposal would give them a means to do just that.</p> <p>The only issue I would raise with Palley's proposal is that if we were to enact it today we would be doing so in an economic environment in which real investment and consumption are tied up with the financial sector in a most unhealthy manner. The partial recoveries in the economies of the US and the UK are reliant on rising asset prices in the housing and stock markets. These are driving not just increased residential investment but also consumption among the top end of town as the 'wealth effect' kicks in.</p> <p>But these problems reflect more the unbalanced and precarious state of many developed economies than they do on Palley's excellent proposal. The reliance of developed economies on asset price increases attests not just to their fragility but also to unequal income distribution and general unfairness. Dealing with these problems requires different solutions. Palley's proposal furnishes us with new tools that we can utilise moving into the future and it should be considered by central banks the world over immediately. But it is no panacea.</p> <p>\u2022 Philip Pilkington is a London-based economist and member of the Political Economy Research Group (PERG) at Kingston University.

      "bodyText": "After years of denial central banks are finally coming around to recognise that they must take responsibility for asset bubbles that can wreak economic havoc. Executive director of the Bank of England Andrew Haldane highlighted this earlier this month when he stated that managing the asset managers would \"require fresh thinking on new policy tools\". But this ties into a far broader problem; namely, how should central banks counteract dangerous pressures in financial markets without generating substantial instability in the real economy? The problem is that central banks must rely primarily on monetary policy to exert control over asset markets. Yes, regulation plays an important role but, as the late great Hyman Minsky taught us, the financial system is highly adaptive and central bankers require a cooling valve when they see markets getting too hot. Unfortunately, if central bankers want to put the markets on ice they have to raise short-term interest rates. If they are pushed to raise these rates too high this can lead to a recession as lending dries up and real investment, as opposed to purely financial investment, crawls to a halt. What central bankers need is a policy tool that can target financial overheating directly while minimising the impact the policy has on real, productive investment. The US economist Thomas Palley has provided just that in his new paper Monetary Policy After Quantitative Easing: The Case for Asset Based Reserve Requirements (ABRR). The way that monetary policy works today is that private banks are required to hold a given amount of reserves \u2013 that is, cash balances at the central bank \u2013 for every loan they extend. The central bank then extends these reserves to the private banking system to set the overnight interest rate at which the banks lend. Palley's ingenious idea is that central banks place reserve requirements on the holdings of assets. In such a scheme there would be additional reserve requirements for each asset class. So, there would be separate reserve requirements for stocks, bonds, mortgage securities and so on. The central bank could set these requirements at zero initially and then when they saw instability being generated in any given market they would raise the reserve requirements on that asset class. This would increase the cost of holding this type of asset and drive up the interest rate on it without directly affecting interest rates in the rest of the system. An example might be instructive. Imagine that the central bank was concerned that the housing market was overheating. But at the same time the level of investment in the economy was not sufficient to generate general price inflation. The central bank could then raise reserve requirements on new mortgage issues. This would subdue over enthusiastic speculators in the housing market while leaving borrowing rates for those engaged in real, productive investment unchanged. Palley points out in his paper, however, that the success of such a policy would be tied to which types of financial institutions were included in the new regulations. Ideally, the asset-based reserve requirements would have to be placed on the whole financial system. That would include not just commercial banks, but also shadow banks and financial intermediaries. This does not seem to me much of a problem, however, because regulators today are increasingly interested in bringing these new types of financial institutions into the regulatory fold and Palley's proposal would give them a means to do just that. The only issue I would raise with Palley's proposal is that if we were to enact it today we would be doing so in an economic environment in which real investment and consumption are tied up with the financial sector in a most unhealthy manner. The partial recoveries in the economies of the US and the UK are reliant on rising asset prices in the housing and stock markets. These are driving not just increased residential investment but also consumption among the top end of town as the 'wealth effect' kicks in. But these problems reflect more the unbalanced and precarious state of many developed economies than they do on Palley's excellent proposal. The reliance of developed economies on asset price increases attests not just to their fragility but also to unequal income distribution and general unfairness. Dealing with these problems requires different solutions. Palley's proposal furnishes us with new tools that we can utilise moving into the future and it should be considered by central banks the world over immediately. But it is no panacea. \u2022 Philip Pilkington is a London-based economist and member of the Political Economy Research Group (PERG) at Kingston University. He runs a blog.

Celebrations are in order because for the first time since the deep recession of 2008/9 earnings are rising faster than prices. Britain is finally getting better off. Well, probably. A degree of hesitation is called for because official confirmation of the rise in living standards will only come with Wednesday's labour market data. This is expected to show that earnings growth in the three months to February was 1.7% or 1.8% higher than in the same three months of 2012-13. Inflation as measured by the consumer prices index is running at 1.6%, meaning the average Briton is getting richer by 0.1-0.2 percentage points a year. Don't spend it all at once, even assuming you are getting it, which you might not be because average earnings can be driven up by generous pay increases for those at the top. The CPI is not, of course, the only measure of the cost of living. Inflation as measured by the now unfashionable retail prices index (RPI), for example, is running at 2.5%, which would mean real wages were still falling. The RPI is no longer classified as an official statistic by the Office for National Statistics, but the CPI \u2013 which does not include high and rising housing costs \u2013 is not a perfect measure either. Even so, the government can look forward to real earnings continuing to rise in the year between now and the 2015 general election. A growing economy means more jobs, although many of them are for the relatively poorly rewarded part-time and self-employed workers. A tighter labour market will push up earnings, while a stronger pound should help to keep downward pressure on inflation. But the increase in real wages is unlikely to match those of the early 2000s, a period when the economy had been growing strongly for a decade and there were generous settlements for two key sectors of the economy: financial services and the public sector. Labour says that the cost of living crisis is not over, and to the extent that it will take several years to recoup the 10% drop in real wages since 2008, the opposition is correct. In May next year real wages will still be a long way below where they were in May 2010. But they will be rising, and that explains why George Osborne is confident Labour's cost of living campaign will be a less potent weapon in a year's time. Why? Because at election time, voters will be mulling over which party is more likely to improve living standards in the next parliament. And when opinion pollsters ask which party is the more economically competent, the Conservatives have a comfortable lead.",

Celebrations are in order because for the first time since the deep recession of 2008/9 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/apr/15/inflation-falls-lowest-since-october-2009\" title=\"\">earnings are rising faster than prices</a>. Britain is finally getting better off. Well, probably.</p> <p>A degree of hesitation is called for because official confirmation of the rise in living standards will only come with Wednesday's labour market data. This is expected to show that earnings growth in the three months to February was 1.7% or 1.8% higher than in the same three months of 2012-13. Inflation as measured by the consumer prices index is running at 1.6%, meaning the average Briton is getting richer by 0.1-0.2 percentage points a year. Don't spend it all at once, even assuming you are getting it, which you might not be because average earnings can be driven up by generous pay increases for those at the top.</p> <p>The CPI is not, of course, the only measure of the cost of living. Inflation as measured by the now unfashionable retail prices index (RPI), for example, is running at 2.5%, which would mean real wages were still falling. The RPI is no longer classified as an official statistic by the Office for National Statistics, but the CPI \u2013 which does not include high and rising housing costs \u2013 is not a perfect measure either.</p> <p>Even so, the government can look forward to real earnings continuing to rise in the year between now and the 2015 general election. A growing economy means more jobs, although many of them are for the relatively poorly rewarded part-time and self-employed workers. A tighter labour market will push up earnings, while a stronger pound should help to keep downward pressure on inflation.</p> <p>But the increase in real wages is unlikely to match those of the early 2000s, a period when the economy had been growing strongly for a decade and there were generous settlements for two key sectors of the economy: financial services and the public sector.</p> <p>Labour says that the cost of living crisis is not over, and to the extent that it will take several years to recoup the 10% drop in real wages since 2008, the opposition is correct. In May next year real wages will still be a long way below where they were in May 2010.</p> <p>But they will be rising, and that explains why George Osborne is confident Labour's cost of living campaign will be a less potent weapon in a year's time. Why? Because at election time, voters will be mulling over which party is more likely to improve living standards in the next parliament. And when opinion pollsters ask which party is the more economically competent, the Conservatives have a comfortable lead.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Inflation fell to its lowest level in more than four years last month, easing the burden on households after years of squeezed incomes. A let-up in petrol price rises helped inflation fall to 1.6% in March from 1.7% in February on the consumer price index (CPI) measure, according to official data. The rate, widely forecast by economists, was the lowest since October 2009 and well below the Bank of England's government-set target for CPI at 2%. The news comes a day before labour market figures on Wednesday are expected to confirm that wage growth has finally overtaken inflation, giving workers their first real pay rise since the coalition came to power in 2010. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the gap between average wage growth and inflation was now at its narrowest since April 2010, and that the last time this had happened was in mid-2008. Chancellor George Osborne seized on the inflation numbers as evidence his policies to turn the economy around were working. \"These latest inflation numbers are welcome news for families. Lower inflation and rising job numbers show our long-term plan is working, and bringing greater economic security. But there is still much more we need to do to build the resilient economy I spoke of at the budget,\" he said in a statement. But Labour, which has sought to focus pre-election sparring on a \"cost of living crisis\", counters that millions of people are not feeling any recovery. Writing in the Guardian on Tuesday, shadow chancellor Ed Balls said people will not buy talk of the crisis being over. \"Because for most families in Britain today such a declaration, on the back of a handful of economic statistics, will only confirm just how out of touch this government is,\" he said. His argument that people are struggling with high and rising housing costs was supported by official data this morning that house price inflation rose to its highest level in almost four years. The ONS said UK house prices rose by 9.1% in the year to February, up from 6.8% in the year to January 2014. House price growth was \"increasing strongly across most parts of the UK\", it added, with prices in London again showing the highest growth. Prices in the capital were up 17.7% on the year. The inflation figures showed that the retail price index (RPI) measure, which includes housing costs and is used to set many pay deals, fell to 2.5% from 2.7% in February, as forecast by economists in a Reuters poll. That was the lowest since December 2009. Economists said the slowdown in inflation would be welcomed by Bank of England policymakers amid growing speculation they may have to raise interest rates sooner than next spring as house prices accelerate and the economy picks up steam. \"Clearly below-target inflation facilitates the Bank of England keeping interest rates down at 0.5%, where we believe they are highly likely to stay through 2014 and during the early months of 2015 despite the economy's improved growth and markedly reduced unemployment,\" said Howard Archer, economist at IHS Global Insight. \"While encouraged by the economy's recent stronger performance, the Bank of England is still not taking sustained recovery for granted and very much wants to see growth become more balanced.\" But others disagreed. Rob Wood, economist at German bank Berenberg, commented: \"Below target inflation does not give the BoE room to keep interest rates at rock bottom levels. Inflation a little below target means interest rates a little below neutral, not at record lows. Rock bottom interest rates are a response to an economic calamity and a serious risk of deflation, not the period of above trend growth that the UK seems likely to experience over the next couple of years.\" \"In any case, it is the inflation outlook that really matters. There is every chance inflation will pick up as economic slack is eroded.\" Economists pointed out that much of March's inflation drop will be reversed next month when distortions from Easter drop out. The holiday fell in March last year but is in April this year. \"This is likely to mark the low point in UK inflation. Next month should show a rebound as petrol price inflation becomes less negative and the impact of Easter holidays pushes up on airfares,\" said Alan Clarke at Scotiabank. There was also little evidence of pipeline pressures on inflation in separate data from the ONS on producer prices. Their output prices, also known as factory gate prices, were up 0.5% on the year. That was ahead of forecasts for 0.3% but still the lowest since October 2009. Producers' input prices, or the materials and fuel costs they face, were down 6.5% on the year, bigger than forecasts for a 6.1% drop and the deepest deflation since September 2009.",
