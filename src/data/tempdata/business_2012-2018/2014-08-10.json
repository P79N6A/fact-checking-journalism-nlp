      "bodyText": "Carillion is pressing Balfour Beatty to reopen the merger talks that would create a \u00a33bn construction giant with peace envoys from the companies holding make-up talks last week. Balfour Beatty, which is behind major projects such as the redevelopment of London's landmark Battersea power station, aborted the days old talks with Carillion at the end of July blaming its \"wholly unexpected\" demand that it hang on to Parsons Brinckerhoff, the US engineering and design business, it put up for sale in May. Balfour said retaining the US business was not part of the plan that was the basis for the talks and the change in terms was \"not acceptable\". However it is understood that representatives of the two companies have met in a tentative attempt to broker a peace deal between the two sides. The board of Carillion, which maintains UK railways, roads and military bases, remains of the mind that there is a powerful strategic rationale for the deal that would create \"very significant\" shareholder value. It is not thought to have changed its stance on the sale of Parsons Brinckerhoff which it sees as a \"jewel\" in the Balfour crown. Under UK takeover panel rules Carillion has until the 21 August to make an offer for Balfour or walk away. In May Balfour stunned investors when it announced plans to sell Parsons Brinckerhoff following concerns the $626m (\u00a3373m) acquisition had failed to deliver significant benefits. The sale, alongside the latest in a string of profit warnings, was accompanied by the departure of chief executive Andrew McNaughton with chairman Steve Marshall stepping up to run the troubled business. The turmoil created a window of opportunity for Carillion boss Richard Howson who approached it to discuss an all-share merger. Balfour, which is the far bigger of the two companies with revenues of \u00a310bn last year, has struggled since the financial crisis with a lack of building work in the UK and the cancellation of projects in Australia, where the company was forced to cut hundreds of jobs last year. Carillion, which last month revealed it was the preferred bidder to expand the main stand at Liverpool Football Club, has a turnover of around \u00a34bn and a successful services division. The enlarged group would have a workforce of 80,000 with analysts predicting a tie-up would deliver \u00a3250m of cost-savings. Balfour, which has issued four profit warnings in the last two years, is due to update the City on its half year results on Wednesday. Last month it warned investors of a \u00a335m hit to profits after trading in its mechanical and electrical engineering division deteriorated with analysts now pencilling in a 17% decline in full year profits. There had been some speculation that the company would use the update to announce the sale of Parsons Brinckerhoff but that is thought to be wide of the mark with the sale process, although well advanced, entering its final round of bids. WS Atkins and WSP are thought to be among the interested parties. Liberum analyst Joe Brent predicts the results will be \"awful\" with the company actually making a loss before gains from disposals are factored in, resulting in first half profits of just \u00a326m. The company has been \"failing to win contracts in its backyard\", says Brent who points to the \u00a3600m Northern Line extension contract which the group missed out on. Nonetheless, Brent reckons the worst is over for Balfour: \"We are near the end of the downgrade cycle if not passed it. The pipeline is growing and construction margins should recover from zero.\"",

My career grew, but slowly: I hated waiting for someone else\u2019s permission to advance, to learn, to grow. Traditional corporate life taught me one indelible lesson. In that playing field, gender almost always trumped smarts or talent; both of those faded when confronted with the right family name or collegiate connections \u2013 neither of which I had. Cubicle life proved to be an uncomfortable fit and I eventually went on to form several companies of my own. As the child of immigrants, I was raised to believe that working hard was a virtue and being given things a foreign ideal. As my world expanded, so did the sexism I saw around me: people eager to embrace tired sexist tropes or minimize the accomplishments that my female friends and I worked hard for. Today\u2019s feminist icons may not burn their bras or say you don\u2019t need a man. They inhabit different forms and career paths, but they all serve a specific role \u2013 educating and empowering the next generation of both women and men, expanding our shared possibilities. Role models come in all shapes and sizes. Some are businesswomen. Some are also mothers. Some rely on sequins and tattoos and redefining what\u2019s mainstream. They are all feminists, however, because they are all women who like to speak for themselves. In the end, that\u2019s the definition of a feminist I like best.",

      "body": "<p>The government has raised the prospect of switching off the UK's copper telephone network, some of which is 140 years old, as it consults on the nation's future digital infrastructure needs.</p> <p>In a <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/digital-communications-infrastructure-strategy-consultation\" title=\"\">strategy paper</a> the Department for Culture, Media and Sport describes a digital Britain 20 years from now where the streets are filled with driverless cars and internet coverage is everywhere.</p> <p>To achieve this vision, the ministry is asking for views on a raft of new measures, including copper switch-off and a widening of the universal service obligation to include broadband.</p> <p>Digital industries minister Ed Vaizey and the Treasury's commercial secretary Lord Deighton commissioned the paper to help draw up the UK's policy on internet, television and telephone networks from 2020 onwards.</p> <p>The creation of the national telephone network, one of the biggest infrastructure achievements of the 20th century, could become obsolete as faster fibre-optic cables begin to cover more of the country.</p> <p>The DCMS, which has asked industry and stakeholders to respond to its consultation by 1 October, argues switching off copper could speed up investment in more modern alternatives like fibre and superfast mobile networks.</p> <p>\"The government is likely at some point to need to consider with operators and the regulator whether switching off copper networks is desirable from a commercial and a policy objective,\" the paper states.</p> <p>It goes on to argue: \"The benefit of switching off copper networks is that this may further incentivise investment by operators to increase coverage of non-copper networks, and also act as a spur to replace last mile copper networks, or allow substitution with mobile or fixed wireless services.\"</p> <p>Most of the telephone network is owned by BT, some 75 million miles of wire, worth between \u00a32.5bn and \u00a35bn according to a 2011 estimate by Investec bank. It is a sum which analysts say could help fund any future fibre builds, depending on the cost of extracting the wires.</p> <p>BT's existing multi-billion pound project to build a fibre network for its residential customers takes the new cables only as far as the green street cabinet. For the so-called \"final mile\" from the cabinet to the doorstep, most homes are still connected with copper.</p> <p>In Australia, the government-owned company rebuilding the national broadband network with fibre has already begun decommissioning the older infrastructure in some areas, and Melbourne's copper service was switched off in May this year.</p> <p>\"The government would need to be sure that any switch-off of copper networks would not leave any consumers without the availability of communications services,\" the DCMS warns. Any deadline would need to be sufficiently far in the future that current planned investments in copper, such a unbundling local exchanges, still make sense financially.</p> <p>A spokeswoman for BT said: \"We are looking at the details of the consultation and will respond by the October deadline. The copper access network continues to evolve so it remains to be seen whether a transition from copper to alternative technologies is necessary. Given the government's commitment to technological neutrality, we would be surprised if any proposals defined technology choice.\"</p> <p>Ministers are also asking whether access to broadband should become a legal right, like water and electricity, in order to prevent a rural versus urban digital divide. Some EU states, including Spain, Malta and Finland, have already introduced universal service obligations (USO) for fast internet access.</p> <p>In the UK, every home and business is entitled to a telephone line and dial-up internet access, but not broadband. The government has a universal service commitment (USC), which is not legally binding, to deliver a minimum broadband speed of 2Mbps to every premises.</p> <p>The consultation paper asks: \"Is there a role for a revised USO or USC to ensure that minimum consumer demand requirements are met and to reduce the potential for a new digital divide? What might this look like?\"</p> <p>Painting a picture of digital Britain from 2025 to 2030, the ministry sets out three potential future scenarios. Under the first, demand for fast internet is modest. Under the third, demand is at the upper end of current forecasts.</p> <p>Outlining scenario three, the paper imagines voice traffic will be carried mainly over mobile phones, with the fixed line connection reserved for internet access. Home working will become more popular as the difference between networks for homes and small businesses blurs. Both will have access to lightning-fast 1Gbps speeds that allow content to be uploaded as rapidly as it is downloaded.</p> <p>\"People's expectations will be that coverage and connectivity are hygiene factors, taken for granted, and that fixed, mobile and Wi-Fi will seamlessly work with each other.

In a strategy paper the Department for Culture, Media and Sport describes a digital Britain 20 years from now where the streets are filled with driverless cars and internet coverage is everywhere. To achieve this vision, the ministry is asking for views on a raft of new measures, including copper switch-off and a widening of the universal service obligation to include broadband. Digital industries minister Ed Vaizey and the Treasury's commercial secretary Lord Deighton commissioned the paper to help draw up the UK's policy on internet, television and telephone networks from 2020 onwards. The creation of the national telephone network, one of the biggest infrastructure achievements of the 20th century, could become obsolete as faster fibre-optic cables begin to cover more of the country. The DCMS, which has asked industry and stakeholders to respond to its consultation by 1 October, argues switching off copper could speed up investment in more modern alternatives like fibre and superfast mobile networks. \"The government is likely at some point to need to consider with operators and the regulator whether switching off copper networks is desirable from a commercial and a policy objective,\" the paper states. It goes on to argue: \"The benefit of switching off copper networks is that this may further incentivise investment by operators to increase coverage of non-copper networks, and also act as a spur to replace last mile copper networks, or allow substitution with mobile or fixed wireless services.\" Most of the telephone network is owned by BT, some 75 million miles of wire, worth between \u00a32.5bn and \u00a35bn according to a 2011 estimate by Investec bank. It is a sum which analysts say could help fund any future fibre builds, depending on the cost of extracting the wires. BT's existing multi-billion pound project to build a fibre network for its residential customers takes the new cables only as far as the green street cabinet. For the so-called \"final mile\" from the cabinet to the doorstep, most homes are still connected with copper. In Australia, the government-owned company rebuilding the national broadband network with fibre has already begun decommissioning the older infrastructure in some areas, and Melbourne's copper service was switched off in May this year. \"The government would need to be sure that any switch-off of copper networks would not leave any consumers without the availability of communications services,\" the DCMS warns. Any deadline would need to be sufficiently far in the future that current planned investments in copper, such a unbundling local exchanges, still make sense financially. A spokeswoman for BT said: \"We are looking at the details of the consultation and will respond by the October deadline. The copper access network continues to evolve so it remains to be seen whether a transition from copper to alternative technologies is necessary. Given the government's commitment to technological neutrality, we would be surprised if any proposals defined technology choice.\" Ministers are also asking whether access to broadband should become a legal right, like water and electricity, in order to prevent a rural versus urban digital divide. Some EU states, including Spain, Malta and Finland, have already introduced universal service obligations (USO) for fast internet access. In the UK, every home and business is entitled to a telephone line and dial-up internet access, but not broadband. The government has a universal service commitment (USC), which is not legally binding, to deliver a minimum broadband speed of 2Mbps to every premises. The consultation paper asks: \"Is there a role for a revised USO or USC to ensure that minimum consumer demand requirements are met and to reduce the potential for a new digital divide? What might this look like?\" Painting a picture of digital Britain from 2025 to 2030, the ministry sets out three potential future scenarios. Under the first, demand for fast internet is modest. Under the third, demand is at the upper end of current forecasts. Outlining scenario three, the paper imagines voice traffic will be carried mainly over mobile phones, with the fixed line connection reserved for internet access. Home working will become more popular as the difference between networks for homes and small businesses blurs. Both will have access to lightning-fast 1Gbps speeds that allow content to be uploaded as rapidly as it is downloaded. \"People's expectations will be that coverage and connectivity are hygiene factors, taken for granted, and that fixed, mobile and Wi-Fi will seamlessly work with each other. Devices will also be simple to use and utilise whichever connectivity is available or best delivers the service required.\" Smart homes, smart energy and smart cities will become the norm, and \"driverless cars will lead to safe motoring requiring ubiquitous road coverage\". DCMS notes that the UK's networks are better than many in Europe, but have slipped behind those in Sweden, the Netherlands, Japan, Korea and the US. Networking specialists Cisco predict that in the UK mobile data traffic will grow 11-fold from 2013 to 2018, reaching 445 petabytes per month by 2018, the equivalent of 111 million DVDs each month or 1,226 million text messages each second. \"Remaining competitive internationally is a key issue for the UK and a world-class digital infrastructure is an important component of that competitiveness,\" the DCMS states.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Bank of England has been scratching its head for months about the state of the economy. Unemployment is much lower than Threadneedle Street envisaged when Mark Carney unveiled his forward guidance strategy this time last year, but so is the rate at which earnings are increasing. Despite the fact that real incomes are barely growing, the numbers for consumer spending look surprisingly strong. Retail sales in the three months to June were 4.5% higher than in the same period of 2013, while new car registrations in July were up by more than 6% on a year earlier. The unbroken run of year-on-year increases in car sales is the longest since records began in 1959. But here\u2019s another twist. More people in work, together with tills ringing in the high street, normally means a big improvement in the public finances as higher income tax and VAT receipts roll in. But reducing the budget deficit is proving to be a long and slow process. In the first three months of the 2014-15 financial year, income tax and capital tax receipts were 3.5% lower than the previous year. Even taking into account the way in which many City bonuses were delayed until April 2013 to exploit the cut in the top rate of income tax, that is a weak performance. So what\u2019s going on? One explanation is that Britain has become a part-time economy. A feature of the labour market is the increasing role played by the self-employed, who account for more than 80% of the net rise in employment since 2008. A large number of the self-employed may be former full-time staff in well-paid jobs in, say, the public sector or construction, who are now scratching a living where they can. What\u2019s more, older people are now topping up pensions by doing a few hours a week stacking shelves or operating the tills at the supermarket. Sprinkle in the effect of a tougher benefits regime and below inflation rises in public sector pay and there you have it: an expanding but more casualised workforce. But this does not entirely square with strong consumer spending. It is possible that raising the tax-free personal income tax allowance to \u00a310,000 has been a factor, because people have come off benefits and into jobs that are not liable to income tax. They are better off than they were but not enough to be making a difference to the taxman. However, for this to be a completely convincing argument, the state finances would still be benefitting from a rise in national insurance contributions. These are payable on earnings more than \u00a3153 a week (or about \u00a37,500 a year). But the latest official data shows national insurance contributions were actually slightly lower in the three months to June 2014 than in the three months to June 2013. So either the jobs that are being created are so low paid that they are not subject to either income tax or national insurance, or something else is going on. That something could be that people on benefits are doing some informal paid work but not declaring it to the taxmanbecause they lose almost as much in benefits as they gain from working. And that the new army of self-employed handymen, management consultants and child minders are not declaring all they earn to HMRC. Of course, this is mere conjecture. Discovering how much paid for economic activity goes unrecorded because people hide it from the taxman is notoriously difficult. The most recent estimates suggest UK output would be just 10% higher were all the cash-in-hand jobs declared to HMRC. A book published by the free-market Institute for Economic Affairs last year concluded that the size of the shadow economy had increased in the UK since 2007, although it is far less significant than in most other European countries. But it is conceivable that Britain is becoming Del Boy Nation: doing a bit of ducking and diving, trying to keep one step ahead of the revenue. That would help explain why consumer spending is rising more rapidly than wages, and why VAT receipts are growing slightly more strongly than income tax receipts. Let\u2019s assume for a moment that there is more informal activity going on. What should the government response be? One option would be to employ more tax inspectors and launch a crackdown on evasion. That, though, would be an uphill struggle. The number of tax inspectors is small. Low-level evasion is large. An alternative would be to encourage those working in the informal economy to join the formal economy. The impediment to that is a tax and benefits system that is hugely complex, means-tested and discourages those working less than full-time on low earnings from working longer hours (at least officially). One radical suggestion is for everybody to receive a citizen\u2019s income. Under this scheme, waged and unwaged, children and adults, the working aged and pensioner, rich and poor alike would receive the same basic income financed by the phasing out of virtually every tax relief and allowance. Those on benefits would not face high marginal tax rates if they took a job, but merely pay PAYE at the current standard rate of 20% on every pound they earned. Those working 20 hours a week on the minimum wage could work 40 hours a week without losing more than 50% of their extra earnings in lost tax credits. There would be other advantages from such a system. First, it would be universal and hence avoid the stigma attached to benefits. Secondly, people taking a job or starting a business would have the security of knowing that they would still have their citizen\u2019s income if the venture did not work out. Concerns that a citizen\u2019s income would encourage the idle to sit at home all day watching daytime TV do not appear to be supported by evidence from pilot schemes in other countries. Even so, there would be cases where this did happen and they would doubtless be highlighted as an example of a something-for-nothing culture. Other drawbacks include the failure so far to construct a citizen\u2019s income that obviates the need for housing benefit, and the political difficulty in persuading voters that a millionaire should be getting the same citizen\u2019s income as a milkman. So far support for a citizen\u2019s income is limited to the Green party, although the government\u2019s switch to a flat-rate state pension is a step in that direction. The truth is that no tax and benefit system is perfect. But the one we have is costly, bureaucratic, ineffective \u2013 and ripe for reform.",

      "bodyText": "After living most of his life with severe hearing problems, John Cradden grabbed the chance to be fitted with a cochlear implant, or \"bionic ear\". But throwing away his hearing aids initially made things worse. \"It was frankly disappointing at first. All I heard on my 'switch-on' was just a loud mush \u2013 a sound with no discernible sharpness or tone to it,\" he says. \"But the implant team said it would take time because, essentially, my brain was relearning to hear, through what was an entirely new hearing physiology.\" Cradden, 42, was born partially deaf. Up to the age of seven, his condition worsened until he was profoundly deaf. It was after a further deterioration in his mid-30s that he decided to get a cochlear implant. The elaborate electrical devices are fitted under the skin behind the ear during surgery and help provide sound signals to the brain, giving profoundly deaf people who cannot benefit from hearing aids the ability to hear \u2013 in effect, replacing the function of a sensory organ. About 400,000 devices have now been fitted around the world. \"I wear it all the time,\" Cradden says. \"It's easy to live with and I wouldn't be without it. I can use the phone more comfortably than I ever did before. I can still enjoy music. I could go on, but the bottom line is that my speech comprehension is better than it ever was with hearing aids. \"Getting the implant came shortly after the birth of my second child and it was great timing, because to be able to swim along today with the inevitably noisy banter of life with two young children is just priceless.\" For Ingeborg Hochmair, seeing a patient benefit from technology for which she and her husband, Erwin, can claim credit is a rewarding experience. In the 1970s, the Hochmairs \u2013 known on the campus of the Vienna University of Technology as the \"Electronic Couple\" \u2013 helped create the first microelectronic multi-channel cochlear implant. The development of the implant allowed users for the first time to understand speech rather than hearing only muffled sound. Med-El, the company co-founded by the Hochmairs in 1980, is now the second-largest producer of cochlear implants in the world, making one-third of all devices fitted each year. Speaking in the midst of a busy conference hall in Berlin recently, Ingeborg Hochmair said Med-El was constantly striving to improve its technology. \"People can enjoy music \u2013 they can converse in surroundings like here, in a foreign language, in a noisy place. If they get implants in both ears, they can localise sounds and have a three-dimensional impression of sound around them. They can feel a real part of the community \u2013 it is all about communication nowadays,\" she said. Ingeborg Hochmair is now chief executive at Med-El while her husband is a professor of applied physics and microengineering at the University of Innsbruck. In 2013, she was a co-recipient of the prestigious Lasker prize for clinical medical research. In Britain, around 10,000 people have been fitted with cochlear implants, according to data from the NHS. \"There is even a greater number of people who are only deaf in one ear who now receive an implant in one ear,\" Hochmair said. \"For little children, that is quite important. If you are deaf in one ear, you typically lose a year at school because it takes you half the sentence to understand where somebody starts talking before you can understand everything, so you really have to concentrate hard.\" While health systems in the EU allow children to receive a cochlear implant early on in their development, this is not the case in parts of Latin America and south-east Asia. \"In many countries, they just don't hear about it and then you have to get the trust of the people,\" Hochmair added. \"It works as soon as there is a critical number of users, then others will hear about it and also trust the possibilities. In the highly developed [health] systems, the growth is now with adult patients. As people get older, many will develop a hearing loss and it is also known that sometimes cognitive decline follows hearing loss. So people shouldn't wait once they are diagnosed with hearing loss \u2013 they should get a hearing aid, and if that is not enough, they should get an implant.\" In Britain, the process of implanting and subsequent surgery costs between \u00a338,000 and \u00a345,000. Usually an adult is able to have only one implant on the NHS while children have two. The high price works out in longer-term benefits, argues Hochmair. \"The therapy is cost-effective because it is a life-changing device. If you implant a little child, then it can most likely attend a normal school, it can get a really good education, it can get a good job, it can become a good taxpayer. Even not considering the improvement in the quality of life for the individual, it really works for society.\" For Cradden, who is writing a book about his experiences with the working title \"The Man Who Misheard His Knife for a Cat\", there is a frustration that the technology is sometimes perceived as enabling deaf people to hear instantly whereas many need at least a year after being fitted with a cochlear implant to get the full benefit. \"They may well 'hear' something instantly when they are switched on for the first time, but they won't understand it. Their brains need time to adapt to \u2013 and then fully comprehend \u2013 the sounds they hear through the implant,\" he says. The so-called bionic ear, credited as being the first device to have replaced a sensory organ, stands as a milestone in innovation in medical technology. In Britain, Christofer Toumazou, chief scientist at Imperial College London's Institute of Biomedical Engineering \u2013 whose most recent invention was a USB stick that decodes a patient's DNA \u2013 was also involved in developing cochlear implants. In the future, it is hoped that other technological innovations, such as the remote monitoring of patients' blood pressure, weight and oxygen levels, will similarly take pressure off accident and emergency departments and save money for the broader health system. How does a cochlear implant work? A cochlear implant consists of an external sound processor that takes in sound and processes it via a minicomputer. The sounds are converted into digital information that is sent internally into the cochlea, the inner part of the ear which processes sound. The signal is then sent along the hearing nerve to the brain as usual. Following the Hochmair's work in the 1970s, people could understand speech rather than only muffled sound.",
