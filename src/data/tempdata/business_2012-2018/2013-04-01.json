      "bodyText": "George Osborne will be handed a rare encouraging assessment of the state of the economy on Tuesday as a survey of businesses predicts that Britain will avoid a triple-dip recession. The forecast from the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) suggests the UK will not plunge into an unprecedented third downturn, but says any improvement in the economy is likely to be slow and protracted. The BCC called on the chancellor to implement rapidly the measures he outlined in last month's budget to stimulate the economy. The report comes amid weaker-than-expected manufacturing data from the US and China, which on Monday caused Wall Street's S&amp;P 500 index to fall back from its record high reached last week. In the UK, strong exports bolstered the services sector in the first three months of the year. The BCC's survey of more than 7,000 companies showed services exports came close to all-time highs reached in 1994. A strong performance from the services sector \u2013 which covers activities that range from retail to banking, and accounts for three-quarters of the UK economy \u2013 could result in a positive reading for first-quarter GDP, due to be published on 25 April. After the economy contracted in the final three months of last year, another quarter of contraction at the beginning of this year would push Britain into a triple-dip recession. Current forecasts for GDP in the first quarter range from a 0.2% decline to 0.2% growth. David Kern, chief economist at the BCC, said the survey results were encouraging. \"Fears of another recession are calmed by our results,\" he said. But he said the economy was still weak compared with long-term trends and the survey pointed towards a \"slow and protracted upturn\". The chancellor used his budget to introduce a number of measures to stimulate the housing market and construction industries. John Longworth, director general of the BCC, called for the government to quickly implement these measures to get growth moving. \"We should not be satisfied with a long and tortuous road to recovery,\" he said. \"These results provide a glimpse of the as-yet-distant sunlit uplands of recovery. Businesses up and down the country are working hard to drive the economy, create jobs and export, but they cannot accelerate this process alone.\" The manufacturers' organisation, the EEF, added its voice to calls for the government to help drive a recovery. Roger Salomone, of the EEF, said: \"Government must reassess its investment priorities, act faster on major issues like airport capacity and take the politics out of infrastructure by setting up an independent commission. The fragility of the UK economy contrasts with the US where data published on Monday showed the manufacturing sector continued to grow in March. However, the pace of growth slowed more than expected. The Institute for Supply Management manufacturing purchasing managers' index fell to 51.3 in March from 54.2 in February \u2013 above the 50 mark that separates expansion from contraction, but short of forecasts of a reading of 54. China's manufacturing sector gathered pace in March, growing at its fastest rate in 11 months, but economists expected a bigger recovery from February's five-month low. The news prompted falls in US shares, after the S&amp;P 500 closed at a record high on Thursday. It fell 0.5% on Monday, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.2% lower. A separate survey out on Tuesday shows that Britain's key financial services sector rebounded strongly in the first quarter, with a rise in business volumes and an increase in profits. Almost half of the companies surveyed by the business lobby group the CBI and the accountancy firm PricewaterhouseCoopers said business volumes increased in the first quarter, while only 17% reported a fall. But the pace of growth was slower than expected, partly because of an unexpected rise in costs as companies took on more staff.",

      "bodyText": "Cyprus president Nicos Anastasiades is under fire after reports emerged that a company run by a member of his family withdrew deposits from the island state ahead of its bailout. A Cypriot TV station has published a list of more than 100 savers alleged to have transferred money out of the country before the rescue deal, which imposed heavy losses on wealthy depositors in Cypriot banks. The reports suggest that A Loutsios &amp; Sons Ltd \u2013 said to be co-owned by Anastasiades' son-in-law \u2013 transferred \u20ac21m (\u00a318m) from Laiki Bank in the week running up to the bailout. The money was then moved to London, according to Haravgi, a newspaper affiliated with the communist party Akel. Cypriot TV station Sigma subsequently published the names of 132 companies and individuals who transferred money out of Cyprus in the weeks before the bailout, giving details that concur with the newspaper report. The list could not be verified although the company has denied that it moved any cash. The president said the reports were an \"attempt to defame companies or people linked to my family\". \"[This] is nothing but an attempt to distract people from the liability of those who led the country to a state of bankruptcy.\" He added that no one, including himself, would escape the ongoing investigations into the crisis that has engulfed the Cypriot economy. Anastasiades said that when the investigative committee assembled he would ask its members to look into this particular case. A spokesman for Akel, Stavros Evagorou, has called on the investigation committee to check allegations about withdrawals by Anastasiades' family members and other transfers out of the country ahead of the bailout. Last week, Cyprus and the troika of international lenders agreed a \u20ac10bn bailout plan aimed at saving the island from financial meltdown. Under the terms of the deal, depositors holding more than \u20ac100,000 at the Bank of Cyprus will lose 37.5% of their savings in exchange for bank shares.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "It had all started to look quite promising. The US was picking up, China had avoided a hard landing and in Japan the early signs from the new government's anti-deflation approach were encouraging. Even in Britain, the first couple of months of 2013 provided some tentative hope \u2013 from the housing market and consumer spending, mainly \u2013 that the economy might escape another year of stagnation. Then Cyprus came along. The last two weeks of March brought the crisis in the eurozone back into the spotlight, and by the end of the month the story was no longer rising share prices on Wall Street on the back of strong corporate profitability or the better prospects for Japanese growth. It was, simply, which country in the eurozone would be the next to require a bailout. The past few days has seen what Nick Parsons, head of strategy at National Australia Bank, has called the \"reverse Spartacus\" effect after the scene at the end of Stanley Kubrick's epic in which captured slaves are offered clemency if they identify the rebel leader. All refuse. In the aftermath of Cyprus, it has been a case of \"I'm not Spartacus\". Four members of the eurozone felt the need to issue statements explaining why they were different from the troubled island in the eastern Med. We now know that Portugal is not Spartacus, Greece is not Spartacus, Malta is not Spartacus and Luxembourg, which has the highest ratio of bank deposits to GDP in the eurozone, is not Spartacus. As Parsons noted wryly, Italy was unable to say it was not Spartacus because it still doesn't have a government to speak on its behalf. Otherwise it would probably have done so. Few of the independent voices in the financial markets take such attempts at reassurance seriously. Another crisis in the eurozone could be avoided, but only if those in charge (sic) act more speedily and effectively than they have in the past. As things stand, another outbreak of trouble looks inevitable. Cyprus has enough money to get by for a couple of months, but by then will be feeling the impact of a slow-motion bank run as depositors remove their money at the rate of \u20ac300 (\u00a3250) a day. The economy has been crippled by the terms of the bailout, a Carthaginian peace if ever there was one, and the country's debt ratio is bound to explode. Investors are already casting a wary eye over Malta, which appears to have been the short-term beneficiary of capital flight from Cyprus, but the bookies favourite for the next country to need a bailout is Slovenia, where the government is already making contingency plans for coping with bank losses. By focusing on the eurozone's minnows, the markets are in danger of overlooking a much bigger potential problem. If attempts to put together a new government in Rome fail, Italy will be facing a second general election and in such a scenario opinion polls currently put Silvio Berlusconi ahead. It is not hard to sketch out a sequence of events in which Berlusconi completes a political comeback, the markets take fright, Italian bond yields go through the roof, the European Central Bank (ECB) under Mario Draghi says it will only buy Italian debt if Berlusconi agrees to a package of austerity and structural reforms, the new government refuses and then calls a referendum on Italy's membership of the single currency. Italy has already had six consecutive quarters of falling GDP and is on course for a seventh, making the recession the longest since modern records began in 1960. So when Berlusconi says he cannot let the country fall into a \"recessive spiral without end\", he strikes a chord. If policymakers are alive to the threat posed by one of the six founder members of the European Economic Community back in 1957, they have yet to show it. The assumptions seem to be that Cyprus is exceptional, that the ECB will ride to the rescue if it proves not to be, and that Europe will be dragged out of the danger zone by the pick-up in the rest of the global economy. This is the height of foolishness. The factors causing the crisis in Cyprus are replicated in many other member states. The ECB's \"big bazooka\" \u2013 buying the bonds of struggling governments without limit \u2013 has yet to be tested, and because Europe is the world's biggest market, the likelihood is that the re-emergence of the sovereign debt crisis will seriously impair growth prospects in North America and Asia. Economists at Fathom Consulting draw a comparison between the eurozone today and the UK at the very start of the financial crisis. Mistakes were made with the handling of Northern Rock because of fears that a bailout would create problems of moral hazard \u2013 in other words helping a bank that had got itself into trouble through its own stupidity would encourage bad behaviour by others. The systemic risks were not recognised, with disastrous consequences. Similarly, the eurozone has not understood the systemic potential of the current crisis, Fathom argues, not least the \"doom loop\" between fragile banks and indebted governments. Austerity is making matters worse because cuts to public spending and higher taxes hit economic activity by more than they reduce government deficits. Public debt as a share of national incomes goes up, not down. Austerity can work, but conditions have to be right for it. It helps if a country's trading partners are growing robustly, because then the squeeze on domestic demand can be offset by rising exports. It helps if the central bank can compensate for tighter fiscal policy by easing monetary policy, either through lower interest rates or through unconventional measures such as quantitative easing (QE). And it helps if the exchange rate can fall. Not one of these conditions applies in the eurozone, which is why the fiscal multipliers \u2013 the impact of tax and spending policies on growth \u2013 are so high. Put bluntly, removing one euro of demand through austerity leads to the loss of more than one euro in GDP. So what should be done? Clearly, the self-defeating nature of current policy needs to be recognised. Countries need to be given more time to put their public finances in order. The emphasis should be shifted from headline budget deficits to structural deficits so that some account is taken of the state of the economic cycle, and the ECB needs to be ready with its own version of QE. Simultaneously, work needs to speed up on creating a banking and fiscal union. Europe could have dealt with Cyprus cheaply and painlessly had there been a pan-European body capable of recapitalising the country's banks. Delay in setting up such a body threatens to be costly. Finally, the eurozone needs to start talking with one voice. A bit of \"I'm Spartacus\" would not go amiss.",

      "body": "<p>It had all started to look quite promising. The US was picking up, China had avoided a hard landing and in Japan the early signs from the new government's anti-deflation approach were encouraging. Even in Britain, the first couple of months of 2013 provided some tentative hope \u2013 from the housing market and consumer spending, mainly \u2013 that the economy might escape another year of stagnation.</p> <p>Then Cyprus came along. The last two weeks of March brought the crisis in the eurozone back into the spotlight, and by the end of the month the story was no longer rising share prices on Wall Street on the back of strong corporate profitability or the better prospects for Japanese growth. It was, simply, which country in the eurozone would be the next to require a bailout.</p> <p>The past few days has seen what Nick Parsons, head of strategy at National Australia Bank, has called the \"reverse Spartacus\" effect after the scene at the end of Stanley Kubrick's epic in which captured slaves are offered clemency if they identify the rebel leader. All refuse.</p> <p>In the aftermath of Cyprus, it has been a case of \"I'm not Spartacus\". Four members of the eurozone felt the need to issue statements explaining why they were different from the troubled island in the eastern Med. We now know that Portugal is not Spartacus, Greece is not Spartacus, Malta is not Spartacus and Luxembourg, which has the highest ratio of bank deposits to GDP in the eurozone, is not Spartacus. As Parsons noted wryly, Italy was unable to say it was not Spartacus because it still doesn't have a government to speak on its behalf. Otherwise it would probably have done so.</p> <p>Few of the independent voices in the financial markets take such attempts at reassurance seriously. Another crisis in the eurozone could be avoided, but only if those in charge (sic) act more speedily and effectively than they have in the past. As things stand, another outbreak of trouble looks inevitable.</p> <p>Cyprus has enough money to get by for a couple of months, but by then will be feeling the impact of a slow-motion bank run as depositors remove their money at the rate of \u20ac300 (\u00a3250) a day. The economy has been crippled by the terms of the bailout, a Carthaginian peace if ever there was one, and the country's debt ratio is bound to explode.</p> <p>Investors are already casting a wary eye over Malta, which appears to have been the short-term beneficiary of capital flight from Cyprus, but the bookies favourite for the next country to need a bailout is Slovenia, where the government is already making contingency plans for coping with bank losses.</p> <p>By focusing on the eurozone's minnows, the markets are in danger of overlooking a much bigger potential problem.
