      "bodyText": "Oil prices surged on global markets as jumpy investors weighed the risk that tensions in Yemen could spiral into a wider Middle East conflict, choking off crude supplies. The cost of a barrel of benchmark Brent crude rose more than 4% on Thursday, to $58.93 (\u00a339.55), after reports emerged about Saudi-led air strikes on the Yemeni capital, Sana\u2019a, and the southern port city of Aden \u2013 close to the key oil supply route through the Gulf of Aden and the Suez canal. A barrel of US West Texas intermediate jumped $2.17, to $51.37. Meanwhile share prices sold off sharply in the City as fears of political risk in the Gulf, together with Federal Reserve officials\u2019 renewed insistence that they are gearing up for a rate rise and the continuing problems with Greece\u2019s finances, sent investors scurrying for safe-haven assets. The price of gold rose 1%, to $1,206 an ounce. \u201cThe air strikes in Yemen have really created a risk-off mood,\u201d said Rabobank strategist Philip Marey. The selloff began on Wall Street late on Wednesday, and was echoed in Asian markets overnight. In Londonon Thursday, the FTSE 100 index of leading shares closed down 1.4% at 6,895.33 points \u2014 down 2.4% since it hit a record high on Tuesday. On Wall Street, stocks initially plunged, but later recovered their losses, while European markets were also weaker. The latest bout of market turmoil came as the Bank of England warned that markets could suddenly seize up, posing a threat to financial stability. As the Bank\u2019s financial policy committee (FPC) \u2013 established to monitor risks in the system and chaired by bank governor Mark Carney \u2013 published its quarterly update on its assessment of the markets, it identified the crisis in Greece, a slowdown in China and the eurozone as the main international risks to the financial system. The FPC said that its annual stress tests on banks, details of which will be published on Monday, would focus on such international risks. Last year\u2019s stress tests were more focused on the threat of a slowdown in the UK economy and a collapse in house prices. In its statement following its meeting on 24 March, the FPC said: \u201cInternational and geopolitical risks to financial stability in the United Kingdom persist. Despite recent encouraging signs, the risk of a low nominal growth in the euro area persists. \u201cThere are also risks associated with a further slowdown in China and to some emerging economies as the stance of monetary policy begins to diverge globally. There also remain significant risks in relation to Greece and its financing needs, including in the near term. \u201cAny of these risks could trigger abrupt shifts in global risk appetite that in turn might lead to a sudden reappraisal of underlying vulnerabilities in highly indebted economies, or sharp adjustments in financial markets,\u201d the Bank said. Growing expectations of tighter US monetary policy have trimmed investors\u2019 optimism about the outlook for the world\u2019s largest economy in recent days, and James Bullard, of the St Louis federal reserve, became the latest policymaker to reiterate the argument that interest rates will soon need to rise. Speaking in Germany, Bullard said: \u201cNow may be a good time to begin normalising US monetary policy so that it is set appropriately for an improving economy over the next two years.\u201d Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, the German finance minister, echoed Bullard\u2019s concerns, arguing that low interest rates in the eurozone are increasing the risk of bubbles in financial markets. \u201cA low interest rate leads to a misallocation of resources with all the risks and side effects that you see when bubbles are forming,\u201d he said. However, ECB president Mario Draghi laid the blame for some of the eurozone\u2019s troubles at Germany\u2019s door, telling the Italian parliament that he had no doubt the country\u2019s oversized trade surplus breaks EU rules on \u201cexcessive imbalances\u201d. Rock bottom oil prices have helped to drive down inflation in oil-importing countries in recent months \u2014 including the UK, where the latest reading on the consumer price index was zero. A renewed rise in oil prices will raise questions about the prospects for company profits.",

    "webTitle": "Shell to cut at least 250 North Sea jobs to remain 'sustainable'", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Shell will cut at least 250 jobs this year and increase workers\u2019 hours at its North Sea operations following the sharp drop in the price of oil. The cuts to staff and agency contractors represent more than 10% of Shell\u2019s workforce of 2,400 in the North Sea. They are in addition to the 250 announced in August, before the oil price started to plunge. The cost of a barrel of crude remained below $60 yesterday, even after bouncing in response to political turmoil in the Middle East. The Anglo-Dutch oil group said employees and agency workers in Aberdeen and on North Sea rigs were told about the cuts on Thursday. Shell also said it would increase employees\u2019 working hours. Its North Sea staff work on a pattern of two weeks on, two weeks off, followed by two weeks on, four weeks off. Shell has proposed three weeks on, three weeks off as a way to increase working time to half on\u2013half off over a year. Shell said the cuts and changes to workers\u2019 terms were not solely a reaction to the near-halving of the oil price since last summer but that the plunge had made its actions more necessary. Paul Goodfellow, Shell\u2019s vice-president of exploration and production for the UK and Ireland, said: \u201cThe North Sea has been a challenging operating environment for some time. \u201cCurrent market conditions make it even more important that we ensure our business is competitive. Changes are vital if it is to be sustainable. They will be implemented without compromising our commitment to the safety of our people and the integrity of our assets.\u201d The GMB union criticised Shell for announcing its intentions before the result of a ballot of its members is announced on Friday. The union has accused energy companies of using the low oil price to undermine workers\u2019 pay and conditions. David Hulse, GMB\u2019s national officer for UK offshore oil and gas, said: \u201cTalks are deadlocked and we are still miles apart over pay, changes to rosters and holiday arrangements, and staffing levels. Unilateral action by employers will make matters worse.\u201d BP has shed hundreds of jobs in Aberdeen and thousands around the world. It has also frozen pay for its workers. Wood Group, the energy services company, has also said it will lay off workers this year because of the falling oil price. Sir Ian Wood, its founder, has said up to 10,000 jobs could be lost in the North Sea over the next 18 months. Britain\u2019s offshore oil and gas industry employs about 375,000 people. A report by the consultants EY last year said almost 10% of those jobs could disappear over the next five years. The chancellor announced tax breaks for the North Sea oil industry in last week\u2019s budget but Shell said they did not go far enough. Companies and unions have called for radical tax changes to support the industry. Shell said the tax changes were a help but not enough on their own to make the industry viable. \u201cReforms to the fiscal regime announced in the budget are a step in the right direction, but the industry must redouble its efforts to tackle costs and improve profitability if the North Sea is to continue to attract investment,\u201d Goodfellow said.",

National Grid and Statnett, the Norwegian transmission system operator, are due to sign the ownership agreement for the 450-mile (730km) interconnector at the British embassy in Oslo, on Thursday. The two-way 1,400MW electricity cable will run from Blyth in Northumberland to Kvilldal, in Rogaland, on the Norwegian side. It will cost about \u20ac2bn (\u00a31.5bn) and completion is planned for 2021. The agreement with Norway will save UK households up to \u00a33.5bn over 25 years by importing cheaper electricity, according to an estimate by Britain\u2019s energy regulator Ofgem. Ed Davey, the energy secretary, said the deal would give Britain access to Norwegian green hydropower at the flick of a switch, to replace wind turbines in the UK when the wind was not blowing. Davey said: \u201cThis is a project I have worked on with Statnett and National Grid for two years and I am delighted they\u2019ve now made this massive investment decision. \u201cIt won\u2019t be all one-way traffic. We are in the process of investing heavily in new low-carbon generation. In the future we would expect that there will be times when our generation exceeds our demand and we are able to export clean power to Norway in return.\u201d There were fears that bad weather at Oslo international airport would prevent the British delegation from flying to the Norwegian capital for the signing, but the event went ahead. Alan Foster, National Grid\u2019s director of European business development, who signed the agreement, said: \u201cAccess to low-carbon energy from Norway hydropower stations will help us meet the challenge of greener, affordable energy. \u201cIt also adds to the diversity of energy sources for the UK and potentially can reduce peak prices with benefits for consumers and businesses.\u201d The interconnector will be the first electricity link between Britain and Norway but the countries already have connections supplying Norwegian gas and oil to the UK. They include the 725-mile Langeled pipeline, which runs from the Nyhamna terminal in Norway, to Easington in Yorkshire. Davey said: \u201cNorway is one our most important energy partners and so far, our partnership has revolved mainly around the fossil fuel resources in the North Sea. This project moves us into a new phase in which the sharing of renewable power can also make significant contributions to both countries.\u201d A group of energy companies announced plans in 2011 to build an electricity interconnector between Norway and Scotland. The proposed 350-mile cable is supposed to be built by 2020 at a cost of \u00a31.75bn. SSE, the British energy supplier, pulled out of the project in 2013. The UK already has electricity interconnectors with France, Ireland and the Netherlands, and wants to add more to meet expected demand for energy. National Grid\u2019s reassurance in October that there would be no winter blackouts was borne out but analysts have said the UK is vulnerable to energy shocks unless supplies are increased.",

      "bodyText": "A combination of concerns left global markets lower, with a rising oil price on Middle East tensions adding to the worries about Greece and the state of the US economy. By the close of play European markets had come off their worst levels with Wall Street - down sharply overnight as Saudi Arabia\u2019s military action in Yemen pushed crude prices higher - staging a slight recovery. The closing scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished 95.64 points or 1.37% lower at 6895.33 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 0.18% to 11,843.68 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.29% lower at 5006.35 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 1.06% to 22,900.27 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 0.1% at 11,453.8 The Athens market lost 3.74% to 764.88 Meanwhile on Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up around 19 points. On that note, it\u2019s time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments and we\u2019ll be back again tomorrow. It\u2019s becoming a little unclear how strong the US economy is, but there is now a general perception that the Federal Reserve will soon be raising interest rates regardless, if not in June then probably by September. Now James Bullard, president of the St Louis Fed, has repeated his view that the risks of keeping interest rates low for too long \u201cmay be substantial.\u201d In a lecture in Frankfurt Bullard - who is a non voting member of the Fed\u2019s board this year - said: Now may be a good time to begin normalizing U.S. monetary policy so that it is set appropriately for an improving economy over the next two years. Even with some normalization, policy will remain exceptionally accommodative. And echoing the \u201cbubble\u201d concerns of German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble he said: If a bubble in a key asset market develops, history has shown that we have little ability to contain it. A gradual normalization would help to mitigate this risk while still providing significant monetary policy accommodation for the U.S. economy. Speaking of Draghi, he has been explaining to the Italian Parliament that the ECB cannot buy Greek bonds as part of its quantitative easing programme. From Reuters: \u201cQE does not buy Greek bonds for three reasons. The first is that it doesn\u2019t buy bonds of countries that are in a programme with the IMF and the European Commission when the review of this programme has not been completed. As you know, in Greece the review was suspended,\u201d Draghi told Italian lawmakers. Draghi said the other reasons for not buying Greek bonds were that their credit rating was too low and that the ECB could not buy bonds from a country above a certain percentage - to avoid \u201carriving at a point where it becomes a country\u2019s biggest creditor\u201d. Meanwhile German finance minster Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble has said low interest rates were causing considerable problems in Germany, there was too much central bank money and debt in the world and there was risk of a bubble forming. Speaking at a banking event in Berlin, he said he was snot criticising the European Central Bank because it needed to defend its inflation target. But he said (quote courtesy Reuters): A low interest rate leads to a misallocation of resources with all the risks and side-effects that you see when bubbles are forming. A reminder that earlier ECB president Mario Draghi told the Italian parliament that there was no doubt Germany\u2019s trade surplus contravened EU rules on excessive imbalances. Kansas Federal Reserve vice president and economist Chad Wilkerson said: We saw our first monthly decline in regional factory activity in over a year. Some firms blamed the West Coast port disruptions, while producers of oil and gas-related equipment blamed low oil prices. The full announcement is here, courtesy Calculated Risk. And more signs of weakness in the US economy: European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said bond-buying by the central bank has brought down long-term interest rates and lowered the euro\u2019s exchange rate against the U.S. dollar, writes Reuters. \u201cThe effect on the exchange rate has been undoubtedly significant,\u201d Draghi said during testimony in parliament on Thursday, noting also the decline in long-term interest rates. The euro hit a 12-year low below $1.05 against the dollar at the start of last week, but has since recovered to $1.09 since. And then this: More from Draghi in the Italian parliament: Time for a recap. With time running out, the Greek government has declared that it will reach a deal with its creditors next week. Greece\u2019s economy minister George Stathakis told Antenna TV that Athens will unlock the funds it needs, predicting: \u201cI think at the beginning of next week we will have a deal, both over the reform package proposed by the Greek government, and over the flow of funding,\u201d The Greek opposition, though, has warned that Greece will run out of money by Easter. New ECB data has shown that bank deposits continued to fall last month, with another \u20ac7.6bn leaking out in February: Uncertainty over Greece has helped drive European stock markets down. The FTSE 100 has shed 1.5%, or 100 points, at 6890. Other European market are also down around 1.5%. Traders are also alarmed by the military action unfolding in Yemen, which has driven the oil price up by 3% today. Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at OANDA, told AP that: \u201cThe conflict has the potential to act as a drag on oil supplies as most oil tankers from Arab producers must pass by the Yemen coastline in order to get through the Red Sea and Suez Canal.\u201d We\u2019ve also had a flurry of generally upbeat economic data: The Bank of Spain has raised its growth forecasts UK retail sales have jumped by 0.7% Initial US jobless claims have fallen to a five-week low German consumer confidence hit a 13-year high. The Bank of England has identified the Greek crisis as a \u201csignificant risk\u201d to the UK economy. In its latest report, the Bank\u2019s financial policy committee said: \u201cInternational and geopolitical risks to financial stability in the United Kingdom persist. Despite recent encouraging signs, the risk of a low nominal growth in the euro area persists. \u201cThere are also risks associated with a further slowdown in China and to some emerging economies as the stance of monetary policy begins to diverge globally. There also remain significant risks in relation to Greece and its financing needs, including in the near term. \u201cAny of these risks could trigger abrupt shifts in global risk appetite that in turn might lead to a sudden reappraisal of underlying vulnerabilities in highly indebted economies, or sharp adjustments in financial markets.\u201d Mario Draghi is urging Italian MPs not to assume that the eurozone is fixed. We\u2019re seeing a cyclical recovery, he says. The ECB chief adds that the eurozone has not been designed to cope with \u201cpermanent creditors and debtors\u201d existing together. Draghi adds that the ECB has \u2018removed doubts\u2019 over the reversibility of the euro. Heads-up: ECB chief Mario Draghi has begun speaking in the Italian parliament, reminding MPs that his powers are limited: Scotland\u2019s oil industry continues to suffer from the drop in the oil price since last summer. Royal Dutch Shell has announced that it is cutting more than one in 10 of its North Sea workforce. Just in: the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefit fell by 9,000 last week to 282,000. That\u2019s a five-week low, and might possibly calm some of the worries about the US economy. Alternatively, it could fuel concerns that the Federal Reserve will take the plunge and raise interest rates in June.... Over in Athens, former prime minister Antonis Samaras has raised the stakes by making public the bailout extension accord which finance minister Yanis Varoufakis agreed with creditors on February 20. Helena Smith reports: The conservative leader - taking the moral high ground - said prime minister Alexis\u2019 Tsipras Syriza/Anel government had failed to release the document fearing the backlash from its own MPs. In effect, the the new administration had \u201cco-signed\u201d the hated \u201cmemorandum\u201d it had vowed to wipe away when in opposition, Samaras argued. \u201cFor one and a half months, the government hasn\u2019t dared bring the accord extending the loan agreement to parliament because the parliamentary groups of Syriza and Anel are afraid of a vote in the House and even more they don\u2019t want the Greek people to learn the truth,\u201d said the erstwhile premier. \u201cWe are making the text public so that every Greek citizen can see it and understand it.\u201d The Tsipras government has made much of the fact that for the FIRST TIME creditors have been taken to task by an administration in Athens bent on conducting real negotiations by putting up a robust defence of the country\u2019s interests. HS Here\u2019s a photo of Samaras during his press conference: And here\u2019s a picture of the Greek sides\u2019s signatures on the February 20th memorandum. Newsflash from Reuters: GREEK PM TSIPRAS, IMF\u2019S LAGARDE DISCUSSED GREECE\u2019S NEGOTIATIONS WITH LENDERS OVER THE PHONE ON WEDNESDAY - GREEK GOVT OFFICIAL Bloomberg have pulled together a handy timelines of Greece\u2019s financial obligations over the next five months, including maturing bonds and repayments to the IMF and the ECB. Worth bookmarking. A new survey from the CBI has shown that Britain\u2019s retailers are more positive, echoing this morning\u2019s decent retail sales figures (see here). A total of 34% of respondents told the CBI that sales volumes rose in March, compared with a year ago, and 15% said they were down, giving a rounded balance of +18%. Last month, the balance was just +1%. Rain Newton-Smith, CBI Director for Economics, says: \u201cSales have recovered following a tough month in February for retailers, and we expect solid growth to continue through Easter. \u201cThe outlook ahead is looking bright, with household incomes buoyed by zero inflation and improving pay packets, which will continue to encourage spending. \u201cHowever, the retail sector isn\u2019t in the clear yet, with some companies, especially food retailers, still feeling the heat from stiff price competition.\u201d Italy just sold two-year bonds at a record low yield of just 0.162%. That\u2019s a remarkably low cost of borrowing, showing the impact that the ECB\u2019s new bond-buying programme continues to have on the markets. It also suggests traders don\u2019t expect eurozone inflation to pick up anytime soon. Over in Greece, opposition New Democracy parliamentary spokesman Kyriakos Mitsotakis has issued a warning that the country could go bankrupt by Easter. Helena Smith reports from Athens: Calling on the leftist-led government to meet the euro group\u2019s demand for a list of reforms as soon as possible, Mitsotakis told Mega TV liquidity problems were such that Greece could hit the rocks of bankruptcy by [Orthodox] Easter. \u201cMoney will run out by Easter,\u201d he said insisting that the debt-stricken nation was now at risk of defaulting because of lost time. Mitsotakis also criticised the ruling coalition for still not bringing the bailout extension accord, reached with creditors on February 20, to parliament. The government is fearful of \u201cthe truth\u201d being told in parliament, he claimed, and worried that many of its own MPs would not vote the agreement through. \u201cWe, however, would back it,\u201d Mitsotakis said. Nikos Filis, parliamentary spokesman for the governing Syriza party, also appeared on the show and insisted that pensions and salaries \u2013 due to be paid next week \u2013 and worth a reputed \u20ac1.7bn were - \u201cnot in danger.\u201d \u201cThere is not going to be a credit event,\u201d said Filis, a former chief editor of Avgi, the left-wing party\u2019s paper. Opposition MPs have accused the government of leading the country to an \u201cInternal default\u201d where it is unable to meet certain payments, most notably pensions and public sector salaries. But anecdotal evidence suggests that growing numbers of Greek civil servants are taking precautionary measures. \u201cI have ensured that I have paid all my bills, including doctors\u2019 visits, because frankly there is very little assurance that we will be paid in full in the coming months,\u201d said one high ranking public sector employee in her sixties. \u201cWe are bankrupt and it is clear the state is running out of money.\u201d It\u2019s not a full-blown run, yet, but Greece\u2019s banking sector continues to suffer from a slow shuffle to the exits. Deposits fell by \u20ac7.8bn in February, according to new ECB data today, as some savers pulled out cash. The selloff in the European stock markets has accelerated, with all the main indices shedding at least 1% so far this morning. London\u2019s FTSE 100 has shed 85 points, in a broad-based selloff. Mike van Dulken at Accendo Markets says confidence has been hit by the conflict in Yemen, Greece\u2019s debt problems, and signs that the US economy is slowing. Over in Frankfurt, shares in German exporters are suffering as the euro rallies against the US dollar, back over the $1.10 mark. Wall Street is on track for further falls today. The biggest faller in the City today is the London Stock Exchange itself, after its biggest shareholder sold a 10% stake. Travel stocks are also suffering, with British Airways owner IAG down 4.5%. Rob Wood of Berenberg Bank isn\u2019t surprised to see UK retail sales rising so strongly last month. Explaining this is not rocket science. Cheaper petrol, food and import prices are cutting shop prices fast, leaving consumers with a little more money to spare after buying essentials. And UK consumers being the shoppers they are tend to spend that extra disposable income. UK retail sales jumped last month, indicating that British consumers are upbeat about economic prospects ahead of May\u2019s general election. The Office for National Statistics reported that sales were up by 0.7% month-on-month in February, and were 5.7% higher than a year ago. Demand for non-food goods such as furniture was particularly high. The ONS also reported that prices fell by 3.6% in February 2015, the largest year-on-year fall since consistent records began in 1997. We learned on Tuesday that inflation across the economy was zero in February; this jump in retail sales suggests people aren\u2019t worried that deflation is setting in [if they were, they\u2019d be deferring purchases until they\u2019re cheaper]. Another encouraging sign for the eurozone: Money supply across the single currency region jumped by 4% last month, the fastest rise in almost six years. However, total lending to eurozone households and firms dipped by 0.1%, the 34th consecutive monthly fall. That suggests the ECB\u2019s stimulus measures aren\u2019t, yet, spurring on lending (although loans to non-financial corporations did rise by \u20ac8bn). Here\u2019s the ECB\u2019s data. Spain\u2019s economic recovery appears to be gathering pace. The Bank of Spain has raised its growth forecast for 2015 to a punchy 2.8%, and predicted that the economy expanded by 0.8% in the first three months of this year. That would make it one of the best-performing areas of the eurozone. Anxiety over Greece\u2019s bailout is hitting its stock market this morning, despite economy minister George Stathakis predicting a deal early next week. The ATG index of leading shares has dropped by 2.5% in early trading, led by financial stocks: Greek government bonds are coming under pressure too, pushing up the yield (or interest rate) on its shorter-term debt. The Russian ruble has jumped by 1.5% against the US dollar , on the back of the oil price spike. The oil prices has surged this morning, after Saudi Arabia launched military action against rebels in Yemen, raising the prospect of wider conflict in the Middle East. The price of a barrel of Brent crude has jumped by 6%, or over three dollars per barrel, to $59.50. US Crude oil also jumped, by a similar amount, to $51.26 Having bombed Houthi rebels in Yemen yesterday, Saudi authorities said that several other countries in the region including Egypt, Pakistan, Jordan and Sudan were ready to commit troops to a ground offensive. The US is also supporting the Saudis, who acted after Houthi rebels - backed by Iran -seized al-Anad airbase and the seaport city of Aden. As Dan Roberts and Kareem Shaheen explain: The advance set the stage for a confrontation between Iran, which backs the rebels also known as Ansar Allah, and regional powers eager to halt the broadening of the Islamic Republic\u2019s regional influence European stock markets have opened in the red, tracking losses on Wall Street following yesterday\u2019s weak US data (see opening post for details). Germany is the biggest faller, with the DAC shedding 1.4%. The FTSE is down 38 points, or 0.6%, at 6951 points - further away from last week\u2019s record highs. While Greeks fret about potential bankruptcy, Germans are their most confidence in over 13 years. GfK\u2019s monthly survey of German consumer confidence has hit 10.0, up from 9.7% a month ago, which is the highest since October 2001. GfK analyst Rolf Buerkl said German consumers are becoming \u201cever more optimistic\u201d; but that would change if the Greek crisis deepened. \u201cIf a Grexit, where Greece renounces the euro and subsequently leaves the euro zone, were in fact to materialise, the German economy could suffer a severe setback as a result.\u201d George Stathaskis\u2019s comments suggest that eurozone finance ministers may gather in Brussels early next week to discuss the Greek crisis again, and potentially release some aid. The Greek government has declared it is confident that it can reach a deal on its economic reforms with the rest of the eurozone early next week. Economy minister George Stathakis told Antenna TV this morning that a breakthrough - which would stave off the risk of bankruptcy - could be just days away. Stathakis said: \u201cI believe that at the beginning of next week we will have an agreement on the package of reforms the Greek government is proposing, and on the funding of the country.\u201d However, he didn\u2019t indicate what kinds of reform are being worked on; Greece\u2019s government must tread a fine line between the demands of its creditors and the expectations of its own MPs. Economists believe Greece could run out of funds as early as April 9th, when an IMF repayment is due. Eurozone officials yesterday refused to hand back \u20ac1.2bn of bailout funds which Greece believed it was entitled too, a move which forces Greece to produce the \u2018concrete\u2019 reforms demanded by lenders. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It looks like another day dominated by Greece debt worries. Athens has until Monday to present a convincing set of economic reforms to its lenders, and its cash reserves are looking increasingly stretched. As our Helena Smith reported last night, Greece is now scrabbling down the back of the fiscal sofa in a bid to meet looming repayments: In a balancing act not seen by any European administration in recent times, the cash-strapped coalition has sequestered the reserves of public bodies, seized EU subsidies destined for farmers and postponed all payments for state supplies in the scramble to continue servicing its debt and paying salaries and pensions. Pension funds have been raided to raise money for Treasury bill auctions. \u201cIt is clear we are reaching the end and very soon won\u2019t be able to pay,\u201d former finance minister, Stefanos Manos, told the Guardian. \u201cThey are scraping the bottom of the barrel for everything they can find.\u201d Greek officials insist that they will devise a plan by Monday, which would give investors the confidence to hand over some bailout funds: Also coming up today.... ECB chief Mario Draghi is visiting his homeland. He\u2019ll be questioned by Italian MPs from 1.15pm GMT (2.15pm local time) about a range of issues, including the eurozone debt The latest UK retail sales figures for February are released at 9.30am GMT US weekly unemployment figures are released at 1.30pm GMT (8.30am in Washington) And Europe\u2019s stock markets are expected to fall, tracking a big selloff on Wall Street last night. US shares were hit by weaker-than-expected economic data on Wednesday, including a 1.4% slide in durable goods orders. Investors are worried that the American economy might not be prepared for a rise in borrowing costs, as Michael Hewson of CMC Markets explains: Investors appear to be caught in two minds as to the health of the US economy, with the Federal Reserve on the one hand apparently gearing up for a rate rise, at the same time as revising down their growth and inflation expectations. This uncertainty has not been helped by further disappointing US economic data, which has served to undermine investor confidence further. I\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day...",

The selloff reduces the government share of the group from 23% to just under 22%. The government has been gradually cutting its stake in Lloyds down from 40% in 2009, after a taxpayer rescue pumped \u00a320bn into the bank at the height of the financial crisis. This latest share sale means the government has recouped a total of \u00a39bn for the public purse since taxpayers were forced to bail out the bank. The chancellor, George Osborne, said the proceeds of the sale would be used to reduce Britain\u2019s national debt. \u201cFive years ago, we were bailing out the banks. Today, thanks to the success of our long-term economic plan, we\u2019re selling more shares and reducing our national debt, which is now falling as a share of GDP by 2015-16,\u201d the chancellor said. The Treasury said the latest move was part of an orderly selloff of the government\u2019s stake in Lloyds. It added that the banking group\u2019s recent decision to start paying a dividend for the first time since the crisis would hand the Treasury at least a further \u00a3100m this year. Lloyds shares were down 1.2% at 79p in late morning trading on Thursday. In a separate development, fellow bailed-out bank Royal Bank of Scotland increased the size of the stake that it is selling in its US business Citizens after receiving stronger-than-expected demand from investors. RBS plans to raise up to $3.7bn from the sale, reducing its stake in Citizens from about 70% to 41.9% if the shares are fully taken up.",

      "bodyText": "Up to a thousand new jobs are planned at a new black cab plant in Coventry following a \u00a3250m investment by the London Taxi Company\u2019s Chinese owner, Geely. It will be home to the company\u2019s research, development and assembly operations, including the development of electric and ultra-low emission black cabs. Construction work on the new plant is scheduled to begin in June this year, with production expected to start in April 2017. LTC\u2019s existing plant in Coventry, which has been running for almost 70 years, will close and its 240-strong workforce will move to the new factory. Investment in the new plant is part of an ambitious plan to capitalise on a new market opening up for black cabs as a result of changing low-emission regulations around the world. At the moment, LTC makes about 2,000 black cabs a year, but the new facility will have the capacity to assemble up to 36,000 cars. The prime minister, David Cameron, said Geely\u2019s investment was good news for Coventry and the broader UK economy. He said: \u201cIt means that more hardworking people will have the financial security that a job and regular pay-packet bring and demonstrates that the UK is open for business. The London black cab is iconic around the world and I am pleased that the next generation will have a state of the art production facility in the UK.\u201d A new version of the famous London black cab will be launched by LTC at the end of 2017 and across international markets in 2018. It is being designed to comply with new rules announced by the London mayor, Boris Johnson, requiring a reduction in the level of emissions allowed from new taxis from January 2018. Johnson said: \u201cThe production of zero-emission capable vehicles, incorporating the latest state of the art technology, is essential as we strive to create the greenest taxi fleet in the world for London. \u201cThe vehicles [the new] facility produces will help transform London\u2019s taxi fleet, boost jobs and growth in London and the West Midlands, and secure the long-term future of the taxi industry, whilst ensuring everyone who lives, works in or visits our city has the cleanest possible air to breathe.\u201d Geely is trying to revive the fortunes of LTC after buying up its assets and the name in 2013 following the collapse of Manganese Bronze, the former owner which was quoted on the London stock exchange. The Chinese car manufacturer already held a 20% stake in the firm since 2009, after forming a joint venture with Manganese Bronze in 2006 to supply the UK business with car parts. Li Shufu, founder and chairman of Zhejiang Geely Holding Group, said: \u201cThis investment will secure the future of London Taxi Company. Almost two years after we acquired this company \u2013 in which we first took a stake in 2006 \u2013 it has become an important part of our global automotive strategy. \u201cToday\u2019s announcement symbolises the close business links between China and the UK, which is an attractive market for Chinese inward investment. The London Taxi expansion will demonstrate the benefits of Anglo-Chinese partnerships.\u201d Geely is hoping its investment in black cabs will open up significant new export opportunities. Currently about 90% of the black cabs made in Coventry are for the UK market, predominantly London, with only a small minority exported. The ambition is that about 20% of taxis will be built for the UK, with the remaining 80% shipped abroad to markets elsewhere in Europe and beyond. The manufacture of a lefthand drive version of the black cab will begin at the new plant about six months after production begins.",

      "bodyText": "SuperGroup is making Idris Elba, The Wire actor, the face of a new premium range of clothing, following a difficult few months. Unveiling a new strategy, the company behind the fashion brand Superdry said the star of Luther would be designing the new line alongside the brand\u2019s founder and design director, James Holder. The premium range will be available online and in shops from autumn/winter 2015 when the chief executive, Euan Sutherland, said he hoped Elba\u2019s profile would help relaunch the Superdry brand in the US, where it had a difficult start. Sutherland said Superdry still appealed to the 18- to 24-year-old market but many shoppers had \u201cgrown up with the brand\u201d and Elba, 42, would appeal to that older generation as well. \u201cHe epitomises what we are: British, grounded and cool,\u201d said Sutherland, the former boss of the Co-operative Group. SuperGroup has bought back exclusive rights to distribute the Superdry brand in the US, Canada and Mexico for \u00a322.3m, ending a 30-year licence deal with a US partner. The business currently has just 15 stores and last year made a \u00a35m loss on \u00a320m of sales. \u201cIdris Elba is a big man in the US and he will automatically reposition Superdry in people\u2019s minds,\u201d said Sutherland. The company hoped to eradicate losses in the US subsidiary over the next two years, he said, potentially closing a few unprofitable stores, before opening new ones and increasing online sales. Sutherland said SuperGroup was now looking forward to \u201csustainable long-term growth\u201d after a period of what he called \u201cunfortunate announcements\u201d in which it was forced to issue a profit warning and lost two key staff members. The company surprised the City last month by revealing that its finance chief, Shaun Wills, had been forced to quit after being declared bankrupt. It was the second senior departure in a fortnight, after the company announced on 12 February that its chief operating officer, Susanne Given, was leaving immediately to \u201cexplore other opportunities\u201d. Shares in SuperGroup rose 6% to 991p as it promised to start handing cash to shareholders, with an interim dividend in its next financial year. The company also confirmed that it expects to meet its full-year profit target of \u00a360-\u00a365m. The brand, known for its heavily logoed T-shirts, expects to open a handful more stores in the UK and will focus on expanding in mainland Europe in the year ahead. Eleven more stores will open in Germany, taking the total to 30, and the company is also looking to expand in Austria, Poland, Spain and Italy in the next five years. The company has appointed Penny Hughes as a nonexecutive director. Hughes, currently a nonexecutive director of Morrisons and Royal Bank of Scotland, will start on 1 April.",
