Last week\u2019s figures revealed an alarming accumulation of bad loans after only a slight economic slowdown in Asia. Nice try, Ryanair One suspects there is more to Ryanair\u2019s rip-roaring first-half performance than the decision to try to be nice (or less horrid) to the passengers. Still, if chief executive Michael O\u2019Leary wants \u201ccustomer experience improvements\u201d to take the credit for a one-third increase in post-tax profits to \u20ac795m, he\u2019s free to try.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "United Biscuits, maker of McVitie\u2019s and Jaffa Cakes, has been swallowed by a Turkish food group in an estimated \u00a32bn deal that will create the world\u2019s third-largest biscuit manufacturer. Yildiz, the new owner, promised it would invest in the Middlesex-based firm, which has a 4,600-strong domestic workforce, with the chairman, Murat \u00dclker, tweeting: \u201cUnited Biscuits is our new star.\u201d In a statement, he added: \u201cWe want to grow United Biscuits to be a global player as part of Yildiz. This will include enhancing its position in the UK, where Yildiz currently has minimal presence, so we will continue to invest in the UK and Europe.\u201d Yildiz, which owns Belgium\u2019s Godiva Chocolate, is thought to have fought off competition from Kellogg\u2019s in the US and rival biscuit maker Burton\u2019s. United Biscuits employs about 7,100 people in total with about 4,600 in the UK at sites including London, Manchester, Carlisle, Glasgow, Halifax, Liverpool and Leicestershire. The sale of United \u2013 whose brands include Jacob\u2019s, Twiglets, Mini Cheddars, and Carr\u2019s \u2013 will deliver a substantial payday for its private equity owners, Blackstone and PAI Partners, which teamed up to buy the business for \u00a31.6bn in 2006. Two years ago United sold off its KP Snacks arm for more than \u00a3500m to the German group Intersnack, and the deal with Yildiz brings to an end a lengthy exit for the owners who, at one point, favoured floating the company on the stock exchange. \u201cUnited Biscuits is a great business and has been an excellent investment for us,\u201d said Lionel Assant, European head of private equity at Blackstone. \u201cYildiz is the best home for the company and will allow [United Biscuits] to fulfil its international growth ambitions.\u201d The existing management team, led by chief executive Martin Glenn, is to remain in place. \u201cWe look forward to being part of Yildiz as we continue to fulfil our growth potential both in the UK and abroad where we are looking to expand our share of the biscuit and snacking markets and where there is huge potential for all our brands.\u201d \u00dclker, whose father and uncle founded the business in 1944, owns the biscuit and chocolate company Ulker Biskuvi Sanayi but also makes drinks, dairy products and frozen foods. Istanbul-based Yildiz remains privately owned with estimated sales of $7bn last year. The deal combines two businesses with complementary geographical footprints as at present Yildiz has a minimal presence in the UK \u2013 where United Biscuits is the market leader \u2013 but a strong presence in North America, the Middle East and North Africa, as well as China and Japan. The deal was cautiously welcomed by union officials. Rhys McCarthy, national officer for the Unite union, said: \u201cToday\u2019s news ends a period of speculation over United Biscuits and we trust will lead to a future of certainty for the workforce that makes some of the nation\u2019s favourite biscuits. \u201cOver the coming weeks we will be seeking assurances from the new owners about the workforce and new investment to ensure that United Biscuits remains a market leader. \u201cWe will also be seeking assurances that there will be no change in the respectful relations we have with management and that the new Turkish owners recognise the important role that independent trade unions play at United Biscuits.\u201d The topic of foreign takeover of UK snack companies is a thorny issue following the acquisition of UK chocolate maker Cadbury by the US cheese slice group Kraft in 2010. The American firm pledged there would be no compulsory redundancies in manufacturing for two years \u2013 but a year later said that 200 jobs would have to go. Kraft subsequently spun off its snacks business \u2013 which included Cadbury \u2013 into a new business called Mondelez International. Other recent deals include Tyrrells, the upmarket crisps brand that began as a sideline for a struggling Herefordshire potato farm, which was sold for \u00a3100m last year to Dubai-based luxury brands investor Investcorp. Meanwhile, in February, the sausage snack Peperami was sold to US meat snacks firm Jack Link\u2019s by consumer goods giant Unilever, which in recent years has also sold Skippy peanut butter, its frozen meal businesses in the US, and the UK and Irish rights to cooking sauces Chicken Tonight and Ragu. Digested biscuits The sale of United Biscuits is the latest chapter in the two-century history of a company that was formed in 1948 with the merger of two Scottish family firms dating back to the early 19th century \u2013 Edinburgh\u2019s McVitie &amp; Price and Glasgow\u2019s MacFarlane Lang. McVitie\u2019s had begun producing the digestive biscuit in 1892, adding chocolate in 1925. The Jaffa Cake began life in 1927. During the first world war, the firm was asked by the government to use its knowledge and production facilities to supply \u201ciron ration\u201d plain biscuits. After United was created in 1948, the firm expanded at home and abroad, with acquisitions including Terry\u2019s of York \u2013 later sold. In 2000 it was bought by Finalrealm, a consortium of investors. Blackstone and PAI bought United for \u00a31.6bn in 2006.",

    "sectionName": "Business", 
    "webTitle": "Eurozone manufacturing remains weak, but UK beats forecasts - business live", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "After a mini-revival by stock markets last week, a mixed bag of manufacturing data across the globe has given investors an excuse to take some profits on the first trading day of the new month. Purchasing managers data from China and the eurozone proved disappointing, while two surveys from the US pointed in different directions. So overall the final scores were: The FTSE 100 finished down 58.50 points or 0.89% at 6487.97 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 0.81% to 9251.70 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.92% lower at 4194.03 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 2.1% to 19,369.03 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 0.99% at 10,374.4 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 17 points or 0.1% lower. And on that note it\u2019s time to shut the blog for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back again tomorrow. Poul Thomsen, who was head of the IMF team for Greece, has been appointed as director of the European department. He succeeds Reza Moghadam who resigned from the IMF in July this year. The fund said: During the global financial crisis, Mr Thomsen was mission chief for Iceland, the first advanced country to suffer the consequences of the crisis. He then led the IMF\u2019s programs for Greece and Portugal. He was appointed Acting Director of the European Department on July 30, and has retained oversight of the IMF\u2019s relations with Greece and its European partners, as well as other IMF programs in Europe\u2014including Romania and Ukraine. Rob Carnell at ING Bank, commenting on the ISM report, suggested the strong data could revive thoughts of an earlier than expected rise in US interest rates: The October manufacturing ISM survey for the US was very strong, coming in at 59.0, a rate historically consistent with a GDP rate of about 5%, though to put it into perspective, we don\u2019t think the underlying rate of GDP growth is anything like that strong, though manufacturing is clearly doing better than the larger, service sector of the economy. Cheap energy is doubtless to thank for part of this outperformance. In terms of Friday\u2019s payrolls release, the employment index rose to 55.5 from 54.6. Order backlogs also rose sharply, suggesting a need for greater investment or employment, or probably both in the months ahead. Interestingly, although new orders were up strongly to 65.8 from 60.0, the new export orders series actually fell slightly to 51.5 \u2013 in keeping with the weaker external environment, and suggesting that most of the US growth momentum currently comes from within. Over the next few days, we look for similar, though perhaps not so pronounced strength from the non-manufacturing ISM and ADP surveys of employment. With the Fed seeming to take a more hawkish stance with their latest statement, this could encourage thoughts of earlier Fed tightening than currently priced, pushing up bond yields, particularly at the front end of the yield curve, and providing the US dollar with further support. Meanwhile the Institute of Supply Management has estimated that US manufacturing rose more strongly than expected. Its index of national factory activity rose to 59 in October from 56.6 in September, and better than the 56.2 expected by a Reuters poll of economists, helped by a rebound in new orders. That brought the index back to the level seen in September, which had been the highest since March 2011. Ahead of Friday\u2019s non-farm payroll numbers, the employment index recovered to 55.5 in October from 54.6 the previous month. And here comes the first of two rival US manufacturing surveys. In October, the sector slowed to its lowest rate of growth since July, according to Markit, hit by a decline in exports as the eurozone slump continues and emerging markets slow down. Markit\u2019s US manufacturing purchasing managers index fell to 55.9 from 57.5 in September, a further decline from the preliminary reading of 56.2 on October 23. The index of new orders dropped from 59.8 in September to 57.1, its lowest level since January. Tim Moore, Markit senior economist, said: October\u2019s survey highlights that the revival in U.S. manufacturing conditions remains on track. Production levels expanded at an impressive rate by international standards and overall momentum is still stronger than the post-recession trend. However, the latest figures indicate that the recovery has lost some intensity at the start of the fourth quarter, reflecting subdued export demand from the euro area and key emerging markets. Time for a recap. Italy and France both saw their manufacturing sectors shrink last month, as the eurozone economy continued to struggle. Markit\u2019s monthly PMI surveys showed that European factory activity rose a little in October, thanks to growth in Germany, Spain and Ireland. But there were few bright spots. New orders fell across and firms in Italy and France cutting jobs as activity contracted. And the overall manufacturing PMI was only just above the 50-point mark separating expansion from contraction: Markit warned that: The eurozone manufacturing sector remained in a state of near-stagnation in October, as weak demand continued to restrict growth of both output and employment across the currency union. In Britain, though, manufacturing growth beat forecasts despite the European slowdown. UK manufacturers cranked up production in October to meet growing domestic demand but export orders fell again as strains in the eurozone continued. Full story: UK manufacturing boosted by domestic demand, survey shows Mike Rigby, head of manufacturing at Barclays, warned that the UK would suffer if the eurozone economy did not improve: \u201cOverseas markets have long been viewed as a crucial component for improved UK economic growth but this current lack of penetration could hamper the ability of manufacturers to lead the recovery as we move towards 2015.\u201d The day began with mixed PMI reports from Asia, with manufacturing growth falling in China, South Korea and Indonesia. And this has pushed European stock markets down -- the FTSE 100 is currently off 28 points, or 0.44%, at 6517. In the eurozone... Greek bond yields have climbed above the 8% mark.... as an EU official told reporters that Athens could not achieve a \u2018completely clean\u2019 bailout exit. And analysts at Eurasia Group have predicted that the opposition Syriza party will win early elections next March. In the corporate world.... HSBC has set aside \u00a3236m to cover settling its role in the foreign exchange-rigging scandal. Ryanair\u2019s shares are now up 9% today, after it raised its profit forecasts. CEO Michael O\u2019Leary says that the new strategy of trying to treat customers well is paying off. Not everyone is impressed: And Britain\u2019s living wage has gone up by 20p per hour... With that I\u2019m handing over to my colleague Nick Fletcher. Britain\u2019s living wage -- the minimum amount needed to provide a basic, decent, standard existence -- is going up. Around 35,000 low-paid workers in the UK will benefit from the 20p per hour increase, to \u00a37.85. But as my colleague Katie Allen explains, the voluntary scheme still faces opposition: There has been a big rise in companies signing up and now more than 1,000 employers are accredited by the scheme. But low pay remains prevalent in Britain, campaigners warn, with bar staff and shop assistants among the most likely to live \u201chand to mouth\u201d. Full story: Living wage increases to \u00a37.85 an hour A reminder that Greece remains a tense place - students and university staff have been demonstrating in Athens today against the government\u2019s education reforms, and budget cuts. Conditions in Brazil\u2019s factory sector have worsened, according to a survey by HSBC and Markit just released. The Brazilian manufacturing PMI fell to 49.1, from 49.3 in September, showing the sector shrank again. Output and new orders declined at a faster rate, and firms cut staffing levels. Production also fell, as manufacturers \u201cadjusted their output according to the generally depressed state of the market and the negative influence of the election\u201d. It is the sixth month of contraction since the beginning of the year; Andre Loes, HSBC\u2019s chief economist for Brazil, warned that conditions are tough. The decline was spread through almost all of the sub-indexes, with output particularly weak. It suggests another challenging quarter for manufacturing.\u201d A quick markets catch-up -- and the main European indices are mostly in the red after an uninspiring morning\u2019s trading. After a big rally on Friday (after Japan boosted its monetary stimulus plan), some investors have returned to fretting about growth prospects. The weak PMI reports from Asia (see 7.37am) and the eurozone (see 9.15am) haven\u2019t provided much cheer: Greece\u2019s government debt is under pressure again this morning, pushing the yield on its 10-year bonds up to 8.2%, from 8.1% on Friday night. Uncertainty over Greece\u2019s bailout plans and its political situation (as discussed earlier) continue to hit confidence. These high bond yields make it increasingly likely that Athens will have to agree new restrictions or budget commitments in return for a credit line. Speaking of Brussels.... Mujtaba Rahman of Eurasia Group agrees with our unnamed EU official that Greece will not be given a completely clean exit from its bailout. \u201cRecent market turbulence\u201d, which saw Greece\u2019s borrowing costs jump, have nixed Athens\u2019 hopes of going it alone, he says. Instead, Rahman predicts that Greece will sign up for a precautionary credit line with the European Stability Mechanism, perhaps early as next month. He writes: Recent market turbulence has changed the calculus in Athens, Brussels and Berlin, increasing the chances of agreement on a European Stability Mechanism Precautionary Credit Line (ECCL) in early December. Here\u2019s the logic: Firstly, the Troika and Eurogroup will not, indeed cannot, fully internalize the emerging difficulties in Greece\u2019s domestic political situation by offering the government a free pass. Hence to qualify for the ECCL, the coalition will have to promulgate VAT, pension and labour market reforms over the next several weeks in order to conclude the fifth review. Secondly, the fact the ECCL will not require new money but rather be based on now unused HFSF funds [money set aside to recapitalise Greek banks] will make passage easier in Conservative Northern Eurozone parliaments. Finally, the Greek government will (on some level) be able to argue this deal is very different from its two previous bailouts. This is because several elements of the ECCL will probably be repackaged and presented in a way that helps the government minimize domestic political and public blowback. For example, the dreaded \u201cMemorandum of Understanding\u201d containing Greece\u2019s reform commitments could be relabeled a \u201cpartnership agreement\u201d; quarterly visits of Troika officials could become bi-annual ones, take place in Paris not Athens, and be attended by deputies, not senior officials, from the participating Troika institutions -- the EC, ECB and also the IMF. Rahman also forecasts that Greece will head to the polls again in March, and that the anti-austerity opposition Syriza party will form the next government. He says: We remain of the view early national elections will take place in March next year, resulting in a Syriza-led coalition government. The likely agreement on the ECCL (especially but not only the aspect of IMF financial participation) will play into [Syriza leader Alexis] Tsipras\u2019 hands, who will reiterate Syriza\u2019s position that they will not accept any agreement between the government and European lenders that creates a \u201cnegative fait accomplis\u201d. Tsipras will argue Samaras got nothing from European creditors for all of the reforms that have been pursued to date (and still need to need to be pursued) -- no clean exit; no debt relief. This chart, from Berenberg bank, shows how the UK\u2019s manufacturing sector (in blue) has grown faster than the eurozone\u2019s (green) since the start of 2012: Berenberg economist, Rob Wood, warns that Europe\u2019s problems could yet hurt the UK: The risk to the UK from the Eurozone is not the direct impact of weak exports, which Britain could easily ride out, but rather the potential for uncertainty to infect UK domestic demand as companies perhaps put off investments. Wood also reckons that today\u2019s PMI data shows the eurozone economy may be stabilising: With the conflict in Ukraine now frozen confidence on the continent could stabilise soon.....external risks seem to be fading, and we expect a clearer turn-around in Eurozone confidence to begin before the end of the year. Over in Brussels, an unnamed EU official is briefing the press pack that Greece is \u2018highly unlikely\u2019 to exit its bailout package without some new arrangement. Last month, the IMF suggested that Greece might need a precautionary credit line -- ie, a safety net tied to various commitments or restrictions. Britain\u2019s factory sector has outperformed the eurozone, despite a drop in demand from overseas. The UK manufacturing PMI rose to a three-month high of 53.2 last month, up from 51.5 in September. That shows faster growth, and beating expectations. However it\u2019s not all rosy -- UK firms reported a drop in new export orders, for the second straight month. Markit says that UK manufacturing sector made a bright start to the final quarter of 2014, despite the weakness of the euro area. The pick up in growth mainly reflected the resilience of the domestic market, as overseas demand was impacted by the ongoing economic weakness of the eurozone and the euro-sterling exchange rate.....\uf0a7 Many UK firms reported a drop in demand from the eurozone; some also cited slower growth in other key markets, such as the US and China. David Noble, CEO at the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply, comments: \u201cThe manufacturing PMI this month received a domestic-fuelled boost as the index reported growth at a three-month high. With new export business declining, it was the UK picking up the new business tab, as the Eurozone continued to experience weakened economic growth with the added punch of unfavourable exchange rates.\u201d France and Italy both remain \u201cserious sources for concern\u201d, says Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight, who has rapidly digested today\u2019s PMI reports. Archer adds: Heightened geopolitical tensions particularly related to Russia/Ukraine have weighed down on confidence across the Eurozone, reinforcing still challenging conditions in many countries and this has likely caused some orders to be delayed or even cancelled. Meanwhile, credit conditions are currently still tight in many countries, unemployment is still elevated and seems likely to creep down at best over the coming months, private and public debt levels remain high in several countries, while consumer purchasing power is constrained by generally limited wage growth. The eurozone manufacturing sector remains wedged in near-stagnation, according to analysis of this morning\u2019s surveys from firms across the region. The growth in Germany and Spain (details start here) was wiped out by Italy\u2019s disappointing return to contraction, and the ongoing weakness in France. Many companies reported a decline in new orders. It suggests that the eurozone economy is struggling to grow after grinding to a halt this summer. As Markit puts it: Weak demand continued to restrict growth of both output and employment across the currency union..... The downturn in France accelerated and Italy fell back into contraction. The rate of deterioration in Greece eased, while Austria fell further from the rest of the pack as its PMI sank to a two-year low The overall Eurozone manufacturing PMI inched up to 50.6 in October, up from September\u2019s 14-month low of 50.3. That does show a small increase in activity, but not enough to pull Europe out of its malaise. Average input costs and output charges both fell; partly due to lower energy prices, and partly due to firms cutting prices to win (or retain) business. Here\u2019s the key points: Rob Dobson, Senior Economist at Markit, says eurozone manufacturing is struggling to recover from its mid-year slowdown. Manufacturing is unlikely to provide any meaningful boost to the currency union\u2019s anaemic GDP growth. \u201cPerhaps most worrying is the trend in new orders, a key bellwether of future output growth, which declined for the second month running. It is hard to see any significant near-term boost to performance while market demand remains insipid and beset by lacklustre domestic conditions, slowing export growth and ongoing economic uncertainties. \u201cNational growth disparities also remain a concern, as solid expansions in Ireland, the Netherlands and Spain provide a marked contrast to the downturns in Italy, Greece, France and Austria. The German industrial engine is also achieving only modest growth. And here\u2019s a summary: Greece\u2019s factory sector suffered another decline in output last month. Its manufacturing PMI rose slightly to 48.8, from 48.4 in September, with export orders picking up. Further evidence that Greece\u2019s economy remains very weak, even though its long recession may be over. It\u2019s a better picture in Germany, where factories reported a rise in activity last month, and an increase in job creation, despite a small drop in new orders. The German manufacturing PMI rose to 51.4 for October, up from September\u2019s 49.9 (which showed a very slight contraction). Here are the key points: Production growth accelerates despite marginal decline in new orders Rate of job creation hits 33-month high Input costs decline at sharpest rate since April The drop in new orders was blamed on \u201ca slowing economy and the Russian sanctions\u201d. French factories continued to cut staffing levels last month, Markit reports: France\u2019s factory sector has shrunk again -- with its manufacturing PMI coming in at 48.5 in October. That shows a sharper contraction than in September (when the PMI was 48.8), but it\u2019s better than feared. Bad news from Italy -- its factory sector has suffered a decline in activity, adding to fears that that country is sliding into recession. The Italian manufacturing PMI fell back to 49.0 last month, down from 50.7 in September, indicating that it contracted (50 is the cut-off point between growth and contraction). Italian firms reported that output levels and new orders both fell last month, forcing them to lay off staff. Here are the key points: \uf0a7 Weakness on order front leads to job cuts as well as lower output \uf0a7 Export growth dips to 22-month low \uf0a7 Fastest decrease in backlogs of work for 18 \uf0a7Phil Smith, economist at Markit. says: \u201cThe manufacturing PMI resumed its worrying slide seen since May after having ticked up slightly in September. Falling back below 50.0, the index points to Italy\u2019s manufacturing sector returning to contraction. \u201cThe survey showed that output dipped in October and, furthermore, a drop in new orders, rapidly shrinking backlogs of work and further accumulation of finished goods bodes ill for November\u2019s output prospects. \u201cManufacturers are back in retrenchment mode, cutting staff that are surplus to requirements and lowering buying levels in order to minimise unwanted build-up of stocks. This scaling back of purchasing activity continued to weigh on input price inflation, which in October reached a five- month low.\u201d Spain\u2019s factory sector has expanded for the 11th month running, but - disappointingly - job creation has slowed. The Spanish PMI was unchanged at 52.6 in October, showing that factories grew at the same pace as in September. Output and new orders both picked up during the month. However Markit, which compiled the report, also found that employment growth had slowed to five-month low. And new export order growth slowed, \u201camid reported weakness in European demand\u201d. The report also shows that deflationary pressures are building. Input costs fell, while output prices (what firms charge) declined at the fastest rate in seven months. So, some reasons to be cautious, as Markit\u2019s Andrew Harker explains: \u201cThe recent solid performance of the Spanish manufacturing sector continued in October in spite of a challenging economic environment. Further rises in output and new orders provide some cause for optimism that the sector won\u2019t head into another downturn as 2014 draws to a close. That said, a couple of the indices sound a note of caution; firstly the rise in new orders was partly driven by price discounting, a trend that has been increasingly evident in recent months. Secondly, employment growth eased to the weakest in five months, suggesting that firms might be lacking some confidence in the sustainability of the recovery.\u201d Banking giant HSBC\u2019s results have just been released, and profits have has missed expectations. The results also show that HSBC has set aside \u00a3236m to cover the cost of settling an investigation by UK authorities over alleged foreign exchange rigging. It has also taken a $550m charge to cover a settlement with the US federal housing finance agency. The City isn\u2019t impress, pushing HSBC\u2019s shares down over 2% to 626p. HSBC is holding a press conference shortly, so we might get more details soon.... Back to today\u2019s factory data, and there\u2019s good news from Poland. It\u2019s manufacturing PMI rose to 51.2, showing growth after three months of contractions. Output and new orders both rose last month. Shares in Ryanair have jumped by 6% after it raised its profit forecasts this morning. The budget airline also reported a 32% jump in half-year profit to \u20ac795m, having recently revamped its customer service. Michael O\u2019Leary, the company\u2019s voluble founder and CEO, says Ryanair is benefitting from treating its customers better, and offering allocated seating and a new business service. He told BBC Breakfast that \u201cI\u2019m a very shy, retiring, Irish farmer.\u201d He\u2019s also just appeared on Sky News, saying that Ryanair is benefitting from (belatedly) prioritising customer service. It\u2019s \u201cbetter late than never\u201d, O\u2019Leary concedes, adding: \u201cThis being nicer to customers is a new and winning strategy\u201d. HSBC\u2019s survey of the Chinese factory sector also found signs of deflation; factory bosses reported a fall in the cost of raw materials, and in their own finished goods. Ireland has bucked the trend of weak growth in Europe and Asia, with factory output growing at a faster rate last month. The Irish manufacturing PMI rose to 56.6 in October, from 55.7 in September, showing that growth accelerated. Firms reported a rise in new orders and production, encouraging them to take on more staff. And \u201cstocks of purchases\u201d rose at the sharpest pace since the survey began in May 1998 Philip O\u2019Sullivan, chief economist at Investec Ireland said: \u201cThe latest Investec Manufacturing PMI report for Ireland shows a substantial strengthening in business conditions in October.... \u201cOctober\u2019s improvement is chiefly attributed to a combination of inventory building and resilient client demand .\u201d The latest manufacturing surveys from Asia have suggested that China\u2019s economic growth slowed last month, with manufacturers in South Korea and Indonesia also reporting tough times in October. The official PMI survey conducted by the Chinese government, released on Saturday, showed growth slipping to a five-month low last month. A rival survey conducted by HSBC, which is weighted towards small firms, looked slightly better -- with activity inching up to a three-month high. But it also found that output and new order growth slowed. Reuters has a good round-up: Asia\u2019s factories are reporting a generalised loss of momentum that speak volumes about the need for more policy stimulus, on top of Japan\u2019s latest efforts to ignite growth. A raft of regional manufacturing surveys on Monday were littered with unwelcome landmarks, including a five-month low for activity in China, a four-month trough for South Korea and a 14-month low for Indonesia. Even China\u2019s long resilient services sector saw growth ebb to the slowest in nine months as the cooling property sector weighed on demand. \u201cWe still see uncertainties, given the property downturn as well as the slow pace of global recovery, and expect further monetary and fiscal easing measures in the months ahead,\u201d said Hongbin Qu, chief economist for China at HSBC. HSBC\u2019s own version of the purchasing management index (PMI) compiled by Markit was a whisker firmer at 50.4 in October, from the September\u2019s 50.2, but showed growth slowing in output and new orders, while companies trimmed staff levels for the 12th straight month. Beijing has already cut taxes, quickened some investment projects, offered short-term loans to banks, instructed local governments to spend their budgets and reduced the amount of deposits that some banks hold as reserves to spur lending. So far, lower mortgage rates have not revived the housing market as quickly as some had hoped, with prices falling for a sixth consecutive month in October, according to one private survey. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, business and finance. There\u2019s lots of economic data coming up this morning, with the publication of October\u2019s manufacturing Purchasing Managers Indexes (PMIs) for many European countries. These PMI reports will show whether factories managed to expand their output, hire more staff and attract more orders last month. Or not. Economists predict a mixed picture -- particularly from France and Italy. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets has summed up those expectations: Today\u2019s latest October manufacturing PMI numbers for Spain, Italy, France and Germany could well serve to increase pressure for additional action on the ECB, particularly if the recent trend of poor Italian and French data continues. Expectations are for slightly weaker numbers of 50.6 and 47.3 respectively, while Spain and Germany are expected to be slightly firmer at 52.4 and 51.8. The eurozone data comes between 8am and 9am GMT, followed by the UK manufacturing PMI at 9.30am. It\u2019s likely to be a calm start to the month in Europe\u2019s stock markets, after last week\u2019s gains: And banking giant HSBC releases its latest financial results, at 8.15am....",

Hence to qualify for the ECCL, the coalition will have to promulgate VAT, pension and labour market reforms over the next several weeks in order to conclude the fifth review. Secondly, the fact the ECCL will not require new money but rather be based on now unused HFSF funds [money set aside to recapitalise Greek banks] will make passage easier in Conservative Northern Eurozone parliaments.</p> <p>Finally, the Greek government will (on some level) be able to argue this deal is very different from its two previous bailouts. This is because several elements of the ECCL will probably be repackaged and presented in a way that helps the government minimize domestic political and public blowback. For example, the dreaded \u201cMemorandum of Understanding\u201d containing Greece\u2019s reform commitments could be relabeled a \u201cpartnership agreement\u201d; quarterly visits of Troika officials could become bi-annual ones, take place in Paris not Athens, and be attended by deputies, not senior officials, from the participating Troika institutions -- the EC, ECB and also the IMF.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e8e31d8278e3dd8eb7a340ca9aac385386efbe7c\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/3/1415011837675/9effb4eb-83b0-49db-bb05-8453a2f11ab8-460x307.jpeg\" alt=\"Protesters hold signs that read 'Uprising', during an Anti-government protest on Saturday.\" width=\"460\" height=\"307\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protesters hold signs that read \u2018Uprising\u2019, during an Anti-government protest in Athens on Saturday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Debets/Pacific Press/BI</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Rahman also forecasts that Greece will head to the polls again in March, and that the anti-austerity opposition Syriza party will form the next government</strong>.<br></p> <p>He says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We remain of the view early national elections will take place in March next year, resulting in a Syriza-led coalition government.</p> <p>The likely agreement on the ECCL (especially but not only the aspect of IMF financial participation) will play into [Syriza leader Alexis] Tsipras\u2019 hands, who will reiterate Syriza\u2019s position that they will not accept any agreement between the government and European lenders that creates a \u201cnegative fait accomplis\u201d. </p> <p>Tsipras will argue Samaras got nothing from European creditors for all of the reforms that have been pursued to date (and still need to need to be pursued) -- no clean exit;

Smith &amp; Nephew slipped 9p to \u00a310.48 as analysts at Societe Generale issued a hold note but cut their target price from \u00a311 to \u00a310.75. They said: Third quarter reported earnings per share were 3% above consensus due to non-operating items. Revenues of $1.1bn (3% underlying growth) and a trading margin of 21.4% (down 20 basis points year on year) were both in line with the market\u2019s expectations. We are however trimming our 2015- 2020 earnings per share forecasts by 2-3% purely to reflect adverse currency movements. Although we recently upgraded the shares to hold, a more constructive view on the shares isn\u2019t warranted for four reasons: 1) given the share rerating since the first half of 2013, the valuation isn\u2019t particularly attractive; 2) given the needed financial deleveraging, the dividend is unlikely to go through a second inflection point; 3) in our best case scenario, upcoming catalysts imply only high single potential upside to our 2020 earnings per share estimate; 4) we believe other segments of the EU Medtech sector are fundamentally more attractive (e.g. radiotherapy dialysis). Smith &amp; Nephew will host an analyst meeting focused on Sports Medicine. We identify five instances where there may be upside risk to our earnings per share forecasts and hence our target price: 1) the company could execute well on its new \u201clow touch\u201d orthopaedic selling model Syncera; 2) the top-line synergies from the ArthroCare acquisition could exceed guidance of $50m; 3) the second (ex US) phase III trial for HP802- 247 could report positive phase III data; 4) share gains in Wound Care could exceed our expectations ; 5) the \u201cmid tier\u201d orthopaedic selling model in Emerging Markets could surprise on the upside. Downside risks: a major acquisition could strain the group both financially and operationally. Online retailers were in demand, on hopes for an improving outlook and amid continuing talk of possible takeovers. Ocado ended 25.6p higher at 274.3p, while AO World added 14.3p to 180.2p and Asos climbed 91p to \u00a327.47. Finally Range Resources rose more than 4% to 0.83p on news than Chinese-based investment group Core Capital Management would subscribe up to $50m for a mixture of shares and convertible bonds. The total number of shares is yet to be determined but Core will not exceed a 30% threshold set by Australian authorities. The funding will be used to accelerate oil production targets and fund acquisitions. Emily Ashford at Cantor Fitzgerald said: This funding is another positive step for Range to progress maintenance of their rig fleet, and to move forward with the next phase of implementation of the waterflood projects.",

      "bodyText": "Being nice pays, Ryanair has declared, with the Irish airline announcing a 32% jump in first-half profits a year after its pledge to transform its customer service. Ryanair\u2019s chief executive, Michael O\u2019Leary, said business was booming since a decision in late 2013 to change its image and stop \u201cunnecessarily pissing people off\u201d. He said: \u201cWhat we have been doing is significantly improving the customer service and it is working like a dream.\u201d O\u2019Leary claimed the brand was being transformed after a change in culture and practices, and that the airline was now \u201cnumber one for customer service\u201d. He said: \u201cOur customer service used to be fairly narrowly defined as the lowest fares, an on-time flight and we didn\u2019t lose your bag. But if it was anything more than that we would tell you politely to go away.\u201d He said Ryanair had spent the year eliminating a lot of the policies passengers did not like, allowing more carry-on baggage, allocated seating and cutting punitive charges. \u201cWe won the war in fares, there was no one left to compete with us on price. So it was the logical thing to do, to go and compete with people on customer service and being nice. \u201cWe tried to improve and address the negatives that were previously associated with the Ryanair brand.\u201d Despite what he called the \u201cnew smiley happy-clappy people\u201d and the launch of new products to attract business passengers and families, O\u2019Leary said: \u201cWe recognise we\u2019re not quite there yet. [But] passengers at primary airports trying us for the first time like the new policies, they like the friendly, smiley cabin crew and the feedback has been positive.\u201d Profits after tax for the first six months of the financial year were \u20ac795m. The Irish airline, which has often given cautious forward guidance to the City, forecast its full-year profits after winter \u2013 traditionally a loss-making period \u2013 would be in the region of \u20ac750m to \u20ac770m, 45% higher than last year. O\u2019Leary describes some of that rise as \u201can easy cop rather than being enormous growth\u201d after the dip in profits in 2013-14 to \u20ac523m, partly skewed by the timing of Easter, from \u20ac569m the previous year. \u201cThe underlying trend is enormously positive. Since we changed the strategy, being fundamentally nicer to our customers, the business has boomed,\u201d he added. Complaints to Ryanair were down 40% to 80,000 letters a year, O\u2019Leary said, adding that many of those were about the landing bugle, played to herald an on-time arrival, the theme tune of which was recently modified to \u201csome Spanish dribble\u201d. There were 4% more passengers in the summer, driving up fares and profit margins. O\u2019Leary said he expects \u201ca Herculean growth\u201d in traffic during the quieter winter, with slightly lower fares and high forward bookings leading the airline to predict 20% more passengers. The airline bumped up its forecast for winter passenger growth by 2.2 m, to increase its full-year passenger numbers to 89m, up 8.5% on last year. \u201cAs a result of this being nice to the customers, bookings and traffic are rising, and we\u2019ve gone out and ordered another 200 aircraft in the last six months so we can double in size,\u201d he said. Ryanair recently placed an order for 200 Boeing 737 Max aircraft that plans to build passenger numbers to 150m by the middle of the next decade, according to the airline. O\u2019Leary said the improved fortunes could also be ascribed to the relaunch and redesign of its website and apps: Ryanair is now the UK\u2019s most searched airline website. After his conversion to the benefits of social media, O\u2019Leary\u2019s online ambitions have expanded wildly, via Ryanair\u2019s new Labs division where, he said, \u201cweird and wonderful techies design new things weekly\u201d. He said a price comparison feature would be launched to show real-time rival fares on the airline\u2019s site and suggested user forums and even airbnb services could be hosted on the site. \u201cTripadvisor shouldn\u2019t exist as an independent platform, it should be on Ryanair,\u201d he said. The airline now expects its bid to take over Cyprus Airways to fail because the \u201cCypriot government will want the Greeks to take it over\u201d, O\u2019Leary said. But Ryanair could still expand into the Middle East regardless, he added. O\u2019Leary\u2019s smile may grow ever sunnier when he reaps a personal windfall in February as a special dividend of \u20ac520m is paid to shareholders, including the chief executive. Michael O\u2019Leary \u2013 in his words \u2022 Being nice \u201cIf I had known being nicer to customers was going to work so well, I would have started many years ago.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s an Irish dynamic. We\u2019re charming chappies generally, we\u2019ve made an institution of being nice to people.\u201d \u2022 A midlife crisis \u201cI\u2019ve learned how to use the Twitter.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re listening to you. We\u2019re responding to your needs, God help me. The Robin Hood fucking stuff does need to change. We need to move away from making noise and actually start communicating with people.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019ll have to evolve, be a different Ryanair. It can\u2019t always be cheeky fucking chappie and in your face. \u2022 Being nasty in the early years \u201cYou\u2019re not getting a refund so fuck off. We don\u2019t want to hear your sob stories. What part of \u2018no refund\u2019 don\u2019t you understand?\u201d \u201cPeople say the customer is always right, but you know what - they\u2019re not.

      "body": "<p>An epidemic jumps from country to country, propelled thousands of miles over land and sea by the ease of modern travel. Researchers at pharmaceutical companies are racing to find a vaccine, a cure, a treatment. <br></p> <p>You invest in their stocks, just helping to save lives. You are one of the good guys, adding resources to the fight. Right? But you are also betting on more and more people getting sick and on getting a pretty rich return for yourself.</p> <p>This is a moral quandary. People profit from bad events. It happens all the time. We all sneer at war profiteers, but entire economies benefited in the economic boom following the second world war. Defense stocks, like <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2014/09/22/investing/defense-stocks-isis-bounce/\">Lockheed Martin and Raytheon, hit record highs</a> last month when the terrorist group Isis stepped up its threat. </p> <p>Turn on <a href=\"http://www.marketwatch.com/story/ebola-stocks-mostly-higher-after-virus-confirmed-in-new-york-2014-10-24\">any</a> <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/id/102118006\">financial</a> <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/lakeland-reports-1-million-hazmat-suit-orders-2014-10\">news</a> <a href=\"http://online.barrons.com/articles/investing-and-ebola-the-hazmat-trade-1413610266\">these days</a>, and the talk is how to profit from Ebola. Stocks in vaccines, experimental new treatments, even hazmat suits are showing speculative pops. Companies you\u2019ve never heard of before, such as Sarepta and Tekmira and Lakeland, are dominating attention. Morbidly, even New York City\u2019s body bag supplier, <a href=\"http://nypost.com/2014/10/16/dont-say-ebola-on-the-radio-fdny-to-911-dispatchers/\">Basheer Mahar of Salam International, Inc</a>, is quoted in the press assuring the city that he has \u201cmore than 100,000 bags on hand.\u201d Business is booming.</p> <p>Let\u2019s say you invested in a speculative small stock such as Lakeland Industries, which makes contamination suits and safety gear. You hedged your bets and put money in pharmaceutical companies developing experimental drugs, such as Sarepta, Tekmira, and BioCryst . You even threw a few dollars at DuPont and Honeywell, the behemoths of protective gear. You got in before the stocks popped in price, and settled down to ride the rise. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"840691b4a96913abcb86a24f239ec4b1a8469040\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/30/1414698854933/00844a31-af8e-4d56-be75-1268a7c4c218-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"World Health Organisation staff check a package of the experimental Ebola vaccine VSE-EBOV at a hospital in Geneva, Switzerland.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">World Health Organisation staff check a package of the experimental Ebola vaccine VSE-EBOV at a hospital in Geneva, Switzerland.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: MATHILDE MISSIONEIRO / WHO / HANDOUT/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But by taking advantage in the rally in Ebola-related stocks are you worse than your friend who invests in Starbucks and Apple? Is betting more people will want a cup of coffee and a fancy new phone a more moral investment strategy than waiting for confirmed Ebola cases to rise?</p> <p>Not exactly, said three ethicists interviewed by the Guardian. </p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s how markets benefit society,\u201d explains Thomas Donaldson, professor of legal studies and business ethics at the Wharton School. \u201cInvesting is wrong when I know that my investment will cause more harm than good or violate a core human value,\u201d explained Donaldson. </p> <p>So while it may seem strange that in some indirect way these stocks are benefiting from the panic over Ebola, and perhaps news stories can be more sensitive when touting the rising stock prices or highlighting a pharmaceutical company that has an Ebola vaccine in its pipeline that no one has noticed yet, there is nothing ethically wrong in benefiting from the investment. </p> <p>The system we have in place requires private investors \u2013 you and I \u2013 to fund drug discovery. Pharmaceutical companies operate for profit. They research those drugs that will get them more revenue and a higher stock price. Whatever their motivation, pharmaceutical companies make drugs that save lives.</p> <p>Drug development is a tricky business, and an expensive one. Literally billions are spent each year on research to find new and better drugs to treat humanity\u2019s ills. A popular estimate is that it takes $1bn (\u00a3620m) or more to discover and develop one new drug. So educate yourself well, and know that you are taking a big bet, but perhaps one that may save some lives, even if it does so indirectly simply by demonstrating which drugs and target molecules don\u2019t work. It is one of the rare cases where a bad investment can at least still have some benefit. <br></p> <p>So invest away. But remember, betting on any drug company can be pretty speculative. When it comes to success, only one in 10 drugs make it all the way from concept to clinic, according to some studies.</p> <p>Virologist Jonas Salk famously did not patent his polio vaccine, forgoing profits, so that it could be widely and cheaply available to the world\u2019s population.

      "bodyText": "An epidemic jumps from country to country, propelled thousands of miles over land and sea by the ease of modern travel. Researchers at pharmaceutical companies are racing to find a vaccine, a cure, a treatment. You invest in their stocks, just helping to save lives. You are one of the good guys, adding resources to the fight. Right? But you are also betting on more and more people getting sick and on getting a pretty rich return for yourself. This is a moral quandary. People profit from bad events. It happens all the time. We all sneer at war profiteers, but entire economies benefited in the economic boom following the second world war. Defense stocks, like Lockheed Martin and Raytheon, hit record highs last month when the terrorist group Isis stepped up its threat. Turn on any financial news these days, and the talk is how to profit from Ebola. Stocks in vaccines, experimental new treatments, even hazmat suits are showing speculative pops. Companies you\u2019ve never heard of before, such as Sarepta and Tekmira and Lakeland, are dominating attention. Morbidly, even New York City\u2019s body bag supplier, Basheer Mahar of Salam International, Inc, is quoted in the press assuring the city that he has \u201cmore than 100,000 bags on hand.\u201d Business is booming. Let\u2019s say you invested in a speculative small stock such as Lakeland Industries, which makes contamination suits and safety gear. You hedged your bets and put money in pharmaceutical companies developing experimental drugs, such as Sarepta, Tekmira, and BioCryst . You even threw a few dollars at DuPont and Honeywell, the behemoths of protective gear. You got in before the stocks popped in price, and settled down to ride the rise. But by taking advantage in the rally in Ebola-related stocks are you worse than your friend who invests in Starbucks and Apple? Is betting more people will want a cup of coffee and a fancy new phone a more moral investment strategy than waiting for confirmed Ebola cases to rise? Not exactly, said three ethicists interviewed by the Guardian. \u201cThat\u2019s how markets benefit society,\u201d explains Thomas Donaldson, professor of legal studies and business ethics at the Wharton School. \u201cInvesting is wrong when I know that my investment will cause more harm than good or violate a core human value,\u201d explained Donaldson. So while it may seem strange that in some indirect way these stocks are benefiting from the panic over Ebola, and perhaps news stories can be more sensitive when touting the rising stock prices or highlighting a pharmaceutical company that has an Ebola vaccine in its pipeline that no one has noticed yet, there is nothing ethically wrong in benefiting from the investment. The system we have in place requires private investors \u2013 you and I \u2013 to fund drug discovery. Pharmaceutical companies operate for profit. They research those drugs that will get them more revenue and a higher stock price. Whatever their motivation, pharmaceutical companies make drugs that save lives. Drug development is a tricky business, and an expensive one. Literally billions are spent each year on research to find new and better drugs to treat humanity\u2019s ills. A popular estimate is that it takes $1bn (\u00a3620m) or more to discover and develop one new drug. So educate yourself well, and know that you are taking a big bet, but perhaps one that may save some lives, even if it does so indirectly simply by demonstrating which drugs and target molecules don\u2019t work. It is one of the rare cases where a bad investment can at least still have some benefit. So invest away. But remember, betting on any drug company can be pretty speculative. When it comes to success, only one in 10 drugs make it all the way from concept to clinic, according to some studies. Virologist Jonas Salk famously did not patent his polio vaccine, forgoing profits, so that it could be widely and cheaply available to the world\u2019s population. Most of us live in a less perfect reality. \u201cBenevolence is a motive far superior to that of self-interest and we should encourage everyone to cultivate it,\u201d says Donaldson. \u201cYet, self-interest is a more reliable basis for organising our economy and securing economic welfare.\u201d And investors motivate for-profit companies to focus on whatever seems to provide the biggest return. So investing in companies because they are working on treatments for Ebola directly motivates a company to complete research on their pipeline drugs, as well as providing the capital for that research. It can also be argued that whatever the motivation of the investor, the end result \u2013 more funding for research or the production of protective gear \u2013 is what really matters. \u201cFor those who might be future beneficiaries, it might not matter what was the motivation.\u201d points out Hersh Shefrin, finance professor at Santa Clara University\u2019s Leavey school of business, whose work focuses on behavioral finance. Putting money into stocks that experience a pop because of the panic over Ebola and then taking your money out before the stock price drops again may be more dubious morally. \u201cSome people\u2019s personal ethics will lead them to feel that it\u2019s not right to benefit from the tragedy of others. If so, they can always identify the gain from \u2018Ebola-investments\u2019 and donate those to a worthy cause, without removing the financial incentive necessary to fight the disease\u201d, points out Shefrin, highlighting the need to fund research into vaccines and better treatments. \u201cI think most people would say it\u2019s permissible to invest in these stocks.

The worst of these were seen in the <a href=\"http://business.time.com/2011/08/05/dont-panic-for-most-of-us-this-market-sell-off-is-a-buying-opportunity/\">summers of 2011</a> and 2012, when investors fretted about the potential collapse of the European Union and about US fiscal woes, such as the stalemate over raising the debt ceiling. </p> <p>There also have been times when investor confidence in specific sectors has evaporated.

A rising stock market that is getting long in the tooth and overvalued \u2013 and that appears increasingly vulnerable to more of these terror-fueled swings as volatility rises \u2013 may not be their idea of a perfect investment option. But what\u2019s the alternative? </p> <p>The trick to navigating an aging and increasingly grumpy bull market is to treat it with care. Back in 2009, when the economic recovery was getting underway and everything was dirt cheap, it was easy to play the recovery simply by buying a broad index fund, which just passively tracked the S&amp;P 500 index.

On the other side of the equation, he is shunning telecom services companies, utilities, materials stocks and real estate investment trusts (or REITs), all of which have seen big gains in value and now look pricey.</p> <p>And almost every penny of future growth in stock prices is going to be tied to growth in earnings, not to a willingness on the part of investors to pay more for those earnings. That means, Gallagher says, that market gains probably will be more modest \u2013 8% to 10%, he predicts \u2013 in the coming year.</p> <p>But it will be pay to be very, <em>very </em>picky indeed when doing your stockpicking. Because even as consumer confidence has recovered to the <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2014/10/28/consumer-confidence/\">highest levels recorded since October 2007</a>, wages and consumer spending haven\u2019t. <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-10-15/retail-sales-in-u-s-decreased-more-than-forecast-in-september.html\">Retail sales</a> aren\u2019t that healthy, either. Companies are booking higher profits, points out Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank, but their revenues aren\u2019t growing as rapidly \u2013 a sign that consumers and businesses are still hoarding their cash, the former because they may not have it to spend, the latter because they prefer to conserve it.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> <blockquote> <p>When picking a stock, ask: Where do the sales come from? Is the market acting as if there is no risk of disappointment?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Of course, this eventually becomes a problem for the bull market \u2013 especially when the capital is confined there, for want of other attractive investment options. \u201cJust as the price of beer goes up when the sailors are in town, so the price of stocks stays high when capital is kept in one market,\u201d Ablin says.</p> <p>Consider the potential for problems in the apartment REIT arena \u2013 one of the best-performing market sectors of 2014. REITs \u2013 real estate investment trusts \u2013 are a frequent favorite of sophisticated investors. The sector is up 30%, while the S&amp;P 500 is ahead 7.7% so far this year, but one Ablin suggests avoiding. REITs generate income as well as the potential for price appreciation, making them particularly attractive investments.<br></p> <p>\u201cBut while apartment REITs keep going up and up, the rental income that supports them can only go up so far, because incomes just aren\u2019t going up,\u201d Ablin points out. \u201cAt some point, reality is going to hit home hard.\u201d </p> <p>Investors, he suggests, should ask themselves questions about the businesses and sectors that they\u2019re thinking of investing in. Where do the sales come from? Is the market pricing the stock as if there is no risk of any disappointment? </p> <p>You don\u2019t have to be a giddy, greedy and irrationally exuberant investor to end up being trampled under the hooves of a bull market. The best strategy when confronted by an aging bull, especially when simply walking away isn\u2019t an option? Be watchful, be prudent, and monitor your portfolio for signs that you may be running foolish risks.</p>",

On the other side of the equation, he is shunning telecom services companies, utilities, materials stocks and real estate investment trusts (or REITs), all of which have seen big gains in value and now look pricey. And almost every penny of future growth in stock prices is going to be tied to growth in earnings, not to a willingness on the part of investors to pay more for those earnings. That means, Gallagher says, that market gains probably will be more modest \u2013 8% to 10%, he predicts \u2013 in the coming year. But it will be pay to be very, very picky indeed when doing your stockpicking. Because even as consumer confidence has recovered to the highest levels recorded since October 2007, wages and consumer spending haven\u2019t. Retail sales aren\u2019t that healthy, either. Companies are booking higher profits, points out Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank, but their revenues aren\u2019t growing as rapidly \u2013 a sign that consumers and businesses are still hoarding their cash, the former because they may not have it to spend, the latter because they prefer to conserve it. Of course, this eventually becomes a problem for the bull market \u2013 especially when the capital is confined there, for want of other attractive investment options. \u201cJust as the price of beer goes up when the sailors are in town, so the price of stocks stays high when capital is kept in one market,\u201d Ablin says. Consider the potential for problems in the apartment REIT arena \u2013 one of the best-performing market sectors of 2014. REITs \u2013 real estate investment trusts \u2013 are a frequent favorite of sophisticated investors. The sector is up 30%, while the S&amp;P 500 is ahead 7.7% so far this year, but one Ablin suggests avoiding. REITs generate income as well as the potential for price appreciation, making them particularly attractive investments. \u201cBut while apartment REITs keep going up and up, the rental income that supports them can only go up so far, because incomes just aren\u2019t going up,\u201d Ablin points out. \u201cAt some point, reality is going to hit home hard.\u201d Investors, he suggests, should ask themselves questions about the businesses and sectors that they\u2019re thinking of investing in. Where do the sales come from? Is the market pricing the stock as if there is no risk of any disappointment? You don\u2019t have to be a giddy, greedy and irrationally exuberant investor to end up being trampled under the hooves of a bull market. The best strategy when confronted by an aging bull, especially when simply walking away isn\u2019t an option? Be watchful, be prudent, and monitor your portfolio for signs that you may be running foolish risks.",

    "fields": {
      "standfirst": "<p>For the past few years the political fight over the cost of living has been focused on power prices and the carbon tax, but if the Reserve Bank decides to lift rates it will have a far greater impact</p>", 
      "body": "<p>Cost of living is always a hot-button political issue. Figures released last week revealed that the annual growth of <a href=\"http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/Lookup/6467.0Main+Features1Sep%202014?OpenDocument\">cost of living</a> for all households slowed over the past three months, largely due to the end of the carbon price in June. While the increase in cost of living for all households is generally lower than usual, the lack of interest rate changes over the past year, however, means that for the first time since 2012 the rise in cost of living is the same for employee households as it is for age pensioner households. It is a reminder that interest rates don\u2019t always go down, and when they start to go up, cost of living becomes even more politically hot than usual.<br></p> <p>The cost of living index differs somewhat from the standard inflation measure of the consumer price index (CPI). The CPI is an average for all households in Australia and it includes housing prices but not interest payments. The cost of living index on the other hand splits households into different types (employees, age pensioners, self-funded retirees, and other government benefit recipients). The cost of living index also measures interest payments, but not housing prices. </p> <p>This difference explains why the cost of living for all household types rose in the past year by less than did the CPI. Housing prices have certainly been rising, but mortgage payments have not \u2013 as the RBA has not changed interest rates since August last year.</p> <p>Thus while the CPI rose by 2.3% over the past year, the cost of living for employee and age pensioner households increased by just 1.9%:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Grogonomics graph 1\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/5C9vM/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The households which saw the cost of living rise the most in the past year were those whose main earner received government benefits. The cost of living for these households increased by the same amount as the CPI, at a rate of 2.3%.</p> <p>The difference between the CPI and the cost of living for pensioners and those on government benefits is important because the government in the<a href=\"https://www.dss.gov.au/about-the-department/publications-articles/corporate-publications/budget-and-additional-estimates-statements/2014-15-budget/budget-fact-sheet-seniors-and-age-pension\"> May budget</a> changed the indexation arrangements for pensions and other benefits from 2017 to be set by just the CPI rather than higher rates of either average weekly earnings or the cost of living for pensioner and benefits households. </p> <p>As a general rule, the CPI rises slower than the cost of living index for pensioners and households on benefits. Thus raising the pension and other welfare benefits by less than it otherwise would have, the government ends up saving money in the long run.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Grogonomics graph 2\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/BQDfx/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>However, in the past 12 months the CPI has risen 0.2% points faster than the cost of living index so, were this to occur again in 2017, pensioners and households would be no worse off than previously (assuming average weekly earnings did not rise by more than either the cost of living or CPI).</p> <p>The figures also show that the overall advantage of lower costs of living increases for employee households compared to all other households is declining as they become more likely to be paying off a mortgage than renting.</p> <p>Employee households on average spend 11.7% of their weekly expenses on interest payments. These can include credit cards, but overwhelmingly it is mortgage payments. </p> <p>By contrast, households whose main income is government benefits spend just 4.9% on interest payments.

      "bodyText": "Cost of living is always a hot-button political issue. Figures released last week revealed that the annual growth of cost of living for all households slowed over the past three months, largely due to the end of the carbon price in June. While the increase in cost of living for all households is generally lower than usual, the lack of interest rate changes over the past year, however, means that for the first time since 2012 the rise in cost of living is the same for employee households as it is for age pensioner households. It is a reminder that interest rates don\u2019t always go down, and when they start to go up, cost of living becomes even more politically hot than usual. The cost of living index differs somewhat from the standard inflation measure of the consumer price index (CPI). The CPI is an average for all households in Australia and it includes housing prices but not interest payments. The cost of living index on the other hand splits households into different types (employees, age pensioners, self-funded retirees, and other government benefit recipients). The cost of living index also measures interest payments, but not housing prices. This difference explains why the cost of living for all household types rose in the past year by less than did the CPI. Housing prices have certainly been rising, but mortgage payments have not \u2013 as the RBA has not changed interest rates since August last year. Thus while the CPI rose by 2.3% over the past year, the cost of living for employee and age pensioner households increased by just 1.9%: The households which saw the cost of living rise the most in the past year were those whose main earner received government benefits. The cost of living for these households increased by the same amount as the CPI, at a rate of 2.3%. The difference between the CPI and the cost of living for pensioners and those on government benefits is important because the government in the May budget changed the indexation arrangements for pensions and other benefits from 2017 to be set by just the CPI rather than higher rates of either average weekly earnings or the cost of living for pensioner and benefits households. As a general rule, the CPI rises slower than the cost of living index for pensioners and households on benefits. Thus raising the pension and other welfare benefits by less than it otherwise would have, the government ends up saving money in the long run. However, in the past 12 months the CPI has risen 0.2% points faster than the cost of living index so, were this to occur again in 2017, pensioners and households would be no worse off than previously (assuming average weekly earnings did not rise by more than either the cost of living or CPI). The figures also show that the overall advantage of lower costs of living increases for employee households compared to all other households is declining as they become more likely to be paying off a mortgage than renting. Employee households on average spend 11.7% of their weekly expenses on interest payments. These can include credit cards, but overwhelmingly it is mortgage payments. By contrast, households whose main income is government benefits spend just 4.9% on interest payments. But even that towers above the mere 0.91% spent by aged pensioner households and 0.7% spent by self-funded retirees on interest. It is not that aged pensioners or retirees are renting to any great extent, but that many have paid off their mortgage already. The drop in electricity prices due to the end of the carbon price also benefitted pensioners and welfare households as they spend a greater share of their weekly expenditure on power than employee households. Non-mortgage households, however, have missed out on enjoying the substantial decline in interest payments that have occurred over the past two years since the RBA began cutting interest rates: As interest rates have not moved for 13 months \u2013 and is unlikely to change tomorrow either \u2013 the decrease in mortgage holders\u2019 cost of living from these low interest payments has mostly come to an end. The cost of living index also highlights, as I discussed last week, how moves to include fresh food under the GST would affect different households. As a general rule, aged pensioners and welfare dependent households spend more of their weekly expenditure on food than employee households. Employee households on average spend just 16.9% of their weekly expenditure on food and non-alcoholic drinks. By comparison, aged pensioner households spend 22.4% and other welfare dependent households spend 19.3%. But more importantly given it is currently GST free, pensioners and welfare dependent households spend more of their money on fresh food, whereas employee households spend 34% of their weekly food budget eating out \u2013 ether on take-away or at restaurants \u2013 which is already subject to GST. Aged pensioners spend just 3.3% of their weekly expenditure eating out (equivalent to about 15% of their weekly food budget). Thus, changes to the GST that would tax food will disproportionately impact aged pensioner households more than employee households. And the poorer the household, regardless of whether they are employed or not, the more income, and therefore tax, would be spent on food. However, some rise in cost of living is more about choice than necessity. While there is always an aspect of keeping up with the Joneses in all households expenditure, if anyone would wish to reduce their cost of living increase, the first thing they should do is quit smoking. Households dependent upon welfare are far and away the biggest consumers of tobacco products: Nearly 6% of such households\u2019 weekly expenditure is on tobacco. In September 2011 the ABS calculated this at around $45 a week. However, given tobacco prices have risen 33% in that time (compared to 6.6% for inflation as a whole) that would mean such households would now be spending around $60 a week. The $60 a week amount is an average that includes households who don\u2019t smoke. Given a 25 pack of cigarettes can now easily set you back $20-$25, you wouldn\u2019t even need to smoke a pack a day to be forking out over $100 a week. Cost of living increases are ever present for every household, but for the past two years the weak economy has kept down price rises. The end of the carbon price has also seen another reduction in cost of living increases. The period of RBA interest rate cuts also greatly helped mortgage holding households reduce their cost of living, compared to other households. But the lack of cuts since August last year means that benefit is an end. For the past two to three years the political cost of living fight has been over power prices and carbon taxes.

An overwhelming majority \u2013 96% \u2013 of business leaders surveyed by the CBI said political uncertainty was discouraging investment. The UK\u2019s infrastructure network is internationally weak, lagging behind North America, the EU, and Australasia according to respondents to the CBI/URS infrastructure survey: 61% of business leaders consider infrastructure in other EU countries to be better than the UK\u2019s - an increase from 59% in 2011. Katja Hall, CBI deputy director-general, said there was a need for politicians to make decisions on infrastructure that extend beyond the five-year electoral cycle. \u201cPoliticians are too often seen as ducking the big, politically difficult questions looming large on businesses\u2019 risk register, like runway capacity and long-term road funding, rather than grasping the nettle. \u201cWe\u2019re at a crossroads. The next government must build on the successful policies of this parliament, but we also need to see bold thinking and a renewal of the politics of infrastructure, finding a new way to agree upon and then consistently deliver the improvements we\u2019ll need over the next fifty years \u2013 not just the next five.\u201d Hall said that the majority of businesses backed the creation of an independent body to assess Britain\u2019s long-term infrastructure needs, lifting the political barriers to progress. \u201cThat 99% of firms think this would have helped the government make a more compelling case for HS2 demonstrates the powerful role a more independent voice could play,\u201d she said. Optimism about the outlook was weak, with 77% of those surveyed predicting Britain\u2019s motorways will stay the same or get worse in the next five years. Meanwhile 46% of firms in London said that the UK\u2019s indecision on new runway capacity was already impacting investment decisions. In a separate report, the manufacturing trade body EEF urged the government to \u201cfinish the job\u201d on Britain\u2019s roads by boosting investment in the UK\u2019s crumbling network. EEF members felt the quality of Britain\u2019s infrastructure was declining rather than improving. \u201cRoads are the backbone of the economy and the glue that holds the rest of the transport network together, with four-fifths of manufacturers saying they are critical to their business operations,\u201d said Terry Scuoler, EEF chief executive. \u201cThe message from manufacturers to the chancellor for the remainder of this parliament is clear, complete the job on vital roads, energy and broadband projects.
