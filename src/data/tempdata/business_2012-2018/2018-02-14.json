      "bodyText": "Wall Street shrugged off signs of building US inflation despite lingering fears that a rapid increase in prices would force the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates. Official US data showed the seasonally adjusted consumer price index (CPI) for January rose 0.5% as households paid more for petrol, rental accommodation and healthcare. The annual rate of growth in prices held steady at 2.1% against economists\u2019 expectations for a fall to 1.9%. The Dow Jones industrial average rose more than 100 points during afternoon trading in New York, having initially fallen slightly following the fresh inflation figures. The Dow has been climbing this week after previously plunging by more than 1,000 points on two separate days earlier this month after early readings from the US jobs market showed rising wage growth, which economists said was likely to push up inflation and force the central bank to raise rates. However, the latest figures prompted a sell-off in US government bonds, sending yields \u2013 which rise as prices fall \u2013 to the highest levels in four years at more than 2.9%. Inflation last month was driven by rising oil prices, which have rebounded on strong global demand in recent months. Food prices also rose in January, which economists said was likely as a result of the dollar falling in value. Sterling rose by about 0.7% on Wednesday to almost $1.40, while the FTSE 100 closed up almost 46 points to 7,213.97. Economists at the consultancy Capital Economics said the stronger than expected reading on US inflation would force the Fed to raise borrowing costs a total of four times this year, beginning with a 25 basis point rise in March \u2013 the first under the new Fed chairman, Jerome Powell, who replaced Janet Yellen earlier this month. However, excluding food and fuel, the CPI rose by 0.3%, while the annual rate was unchanged at 1.8% \u2013 below the Fed\u2019s target rate of 2%. That may have soothed investors\u2019 fears, according to Chris Beauchamp, the chief market analyst at IG. \u201cIt\u2019s too early to start pencilling more rate hikes from the new Powell-era Fed,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "Jim Ratcliffe, the multibillionaire chemicals tycoon and Brexit supporter, has handed a contract to create a \u201cBritish\u201d successor to the Land Rover Defender to a company in Germany. With a fortune estimated at \u00a37bn, Ratcliffe is the second-richest person in Britain after 27-year-old property heir Hugh Grosvenor. He said on Wednesday his chemicals company Ineos had signed up more than 200 German engineers to create a new \u201cworld-class 4x4\u201d, the idea for which he first conceived in a pub near Buckingham Palace. Ineos said Stuttgart-based engineering firm MBtech will \u201ctake the initial design concepts through to a fully engineered vehicle \u2026 followed by prototypes\u201d produced in 2018 in Germany. The company said it was evaluating a number of options for full-scale production of the vehicle in the UK and abroad. \u201cOur preference is for a UK location, but the choice must be about head as well as heart,\u201d a spokesperson said. Ratcliffe had said the UK was his number one choice for a \u00a3600m production facility, but only if the government subsidised the venture, which he said would create 10,000 jobs. \u201cIt would be quite a challenge to do it in the UK without a subsidy because there are facilities and trained workforces [elsewhere],\u201d he said last year. \u201cSo in the UK we get higher risk and higher costs. At the end of the day it has to be a profitable venture.\u201d Ratcliffe, a vocal supporter of the leave campaign, had told Sun readers: \u201cOur preference is to build it in the UK, on the eastern seaboard. We\u2019d like to retain the Britishness and have a bit of passion about UK manufacturing. We believe that Britain can produce something as reliable as Germany or Japan if we do it well.\u201d Dirk Heilmann, chief executive of Ineos Automotive, said: \u201cWe have found a quality partner in MBtech who we believe have the competency, talent and foresight to enable us to deliver a high-quality vehicle to the market. \u201cThis deal will bring together German engineering and British entrepreneurship to create a truly formidable off-roader.\u201d Ratcliffe said he came up with the idea of pumping half a billion pounds into creating a successor to the Defender, which Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) ceased producing in 2016 after 68 years, over beers in the Grenadier pub in Belgravia. \u201cIt was just there at the bar,\u201d he told the Telegraph. \u201cIt was after the second pint.\u201d The Ineos chairman and majority shareholder said he wanted to create a \u201crugged, uncompromising, no frills\u201d successor to the Defender because of his love for the original, which is also a favourite of the Queen. \u201cWhen I\u2019m on safari in Africa I always prefer to be in a Land Rover,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I always carry a picnic basket.\u201d Ineos has dubbed the vehicle Projekt Grenadier after the pub, but has asked members of the public to suggest a permanent brand name. JLR, which plans to bring out a next-generation version of the Defender next year, has filed trademark applications to protect the shape of its Land Rovers, which date back to 1948. Ratcliffe, who was born and brought up in a council house on the outskirts of Manchester, founded a predecessor of Ineos 25 years ago and sank his life savings into it. Ineos has grown to become the largest private company in the UK. It expects to make annual sales of \u00a344bn and profits of between \u00a33.6bn and \u00a34.4bn this year. The company\u2019s eclectic portfolio of assets includes Swiss football club Lausanne-Sport and luxury jacket maker Belstaff.",

      "bodyText": "A month after the government contractor Carillion folded, the effects of its failure are still filtering through. The latest cost of the company\u2019s collapse has landed on the construction firm Galliford Try, which is to tap shareholders for \u00a3150m after taking a \u00a325m hit on the cost of picking up Carillion\u2019s share of their Aberdeen bypass joint venture. Galliford Try needed the extra cash, it said, so that it did not have to divert money from other projects it was working on. Its shares slumped more than 18%, wiping more than \u00a3150m off its stock market value. MPs have raised fresh concerns that former Carillion staff who have been made redundant are being left in the dark and could wait six weeks for redundancy and statutory notice pay. The outsourcing firm Serco emerged as a rare winner from Carillion\u2019s failure: it had previously agreed a \u00a348m deal to take over NHS contracts from the company, but will now pay \u00a330m. As the Insolvency Service picks over the remains in an effort to save jobs and keep public services running, here are the key developments: Jobs Carillion employed about 19,500 people in the UK. The official receiver, an office of the government\u2019s Insolvency Service, is trying to find new employers for them, mostly by identifying other businesses willing to take over contracts. So far, 6,668 jobs have been saved, more than a third of the company\u2019s headcount. But nearly 1,000 staff have already been made redundant and a further 11,800 are hanging in the balance. It looks likely that more jobs will be rescued, after the Insolvency Service reported a \u201clot of interest\u201d from companies keen to buy out Carillion\u2019s contracts. But Frank Field, chair of the work and pensions committee, and Rachel Reeves, his counterpart on the business committee, wrote to the Insolvency Service on Wednesday with fresh concerns. They said staff had not been told how long they would have to wait for redundancy and statutory notice pay and warned it could be six weeks before payment arrived. However, some suppliers to Carillion have already laid off staff and the full impact on jobs in Carillion\u2019s supply chain is unlikely to be clear for months. Suppliers and small firms Carillion subcontracted much of its private and public sector work \u2013 from cleaning to landscaping \u2013 to an estimated 30,000 small companies, many hired for their specialist expertise. It was also a notorious late payer, according to the Federation of Small Businesses. That means many companies that were already operating on wafer-thin margins have lost a lucrative client that owed them money. Court documents revealed last month that those companies are unlikely to get anything back, at most a penny in the pound. Writing off these outstanding bills could mean firing people, or even threaten the survival of small businesses. The British Business Bank is providing \u00a3100m in loans to affected firms, while high street banks have agreed to provide \u00a3225m of assistance such as overdraft extensions and loan repayment holidays. But reports are already emerging that these facilities are taking a long time to be approved. Big business Larger firms that worked with Carillion, or were its competitors, have also been affected. Rival outsourcing firms have seen their share prices tumble amid mounting concern among investors about the general outlook for the sector. One rare winner is Serco, in the midst of its own financial recovery plan under the leadership of Winston Churchill\u2019s grandson Rupert Soames. Serco agreed to buy contracts to manage NHS facilities from Carillion last year for \u00a348m but will now pay 38% less. The UK\u2019s largest construction firm Balfour Beatty was working with Galliford Try on the Aberdeen bypass project and has said Carillion\u2019s collapse could cost it up to \u00a345m. The inquiries A joint inquiry has already begun, led by MPs on the work and pensions select committee and their counterparts on the business committee. They have demanded answers from pension regulators and trustees involved in Carillion\u2019s retirement schemes. They have also procured evidence from the big four accountancy firms, whom they accused of \u201cfeasting\u201d on Carillion, pointing to \u00a372m in fees those firms billed over the 10 years leading up to its collapse. The auditor KPMG will face questions next week. In evidence to the committee, the firm said it could not have seen the collapse coming, pointing to the speed at which things can go wrong in construction. MPs are expected to ask why it deserved \u00a320m in fees if it was so powerless to spot the iceberg ahead. The biggest fireworks from the inquiry so far came during evidence sessions with former Carillion directors, who were branded \u201cdelusional\u201d by Field and Reeves. Asked during the session if they would voluntarily hand back bonuses, they declined to do so. An inquiry by the Financial Conduct Authority is also under way, looking at the veracity of Carillion\u2019s statements to the stock market, while the Financial Reporting Council is examining whether KPMG might have been at fault. The business secretary, Greg Clark, asked the Insolvency Service to fast-track an investigation into the conduct of Carillion\u2019s current and former directors. \u201cAny evidence of misconduct will be taken very seriously,\u201d he warned. Large-scale projects In many cases the work that Carillion was doing in the public and private sectors has carried on more or less uninterrupted. The Insolvency Service has found some new contractors, or is paying for work to continue as normal in vital public services such as school catering. The future is less certain for two multimillion pound hospital projects, the Royal Liverpool University hospital, and the Midland Metropolitan hospital in Birmingham. Work stopped on those projects after Carillion\u2019s liquidation and they are now facing fresh delays, having already been postponed. These were among the projects that brought Carillion\u2019s financial problems to a head \u2013 and that could make finding new contractors difficult and expensive. The pensioners Carillion grew fast by taking over companies, including Alfred McAlpine, Mowlem and George Wimpey. Each deal brought with it a pension scheme, and the combined schemes, which have nearly 30,000 members, are estimated to be at least \u00a3990m in deficit. The government\u2019s pensions lifeboat, the Pension Protection Fund (PPF), is expected to assume a liability of up to \u00a3900m, its largest ever. It has enough money to do that, but scheme members will face payout cuts of about 15%.",

The official receiver, an office of the government\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/insolvency-service\">Insolvency Service</a>, is trying to find new employers for them, mostly by identifying other businesses willing to take over contracts.</p> \n<p>So far, 6,668 jobs have been saved, more than a third of the company\u2019s headcount. But nearly 1,000 staff have already been made redundant and a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/12/carillion-jobs-prison-defence-staff\">further 11,800 are hanging in the balance</a>.<br></p> \n<p>It looks likely that more jobs will be rescued, after the Insolvency Service reported a \u201clot of interest\u201d from companies keen to buy out Carillion\u2019s contracts.</p> \n<p>But Frank Field, chair of the work and pensions committee, and Rachel Reeves, his counterpart on the business committee, wrote to the Insolvency Service on Wednesday with fresh concerns. They said staff had not been told how long they would have to wait for redundancy and statutory notice pay and warned it could be six weeks before payment arrived.</p> \n<p>However, some suppliers to Carillion have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/16/carillion-subcontractors-laying-off-staff-collapse\">already laid off staff</a> and the full impact on jobs in Carillion\u2019s supply chain is unlikely to be clear for months.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ae4c6f9c-382a-496d-93d7-83d311ebb9c8\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>What was Carillion?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The Wolverhampton-based firm was second only to Balfour Beatty in size.<br></p>\n    <p>It was spun out of the Tarmac construction business in 1999 and steadily took over rivals, such as Mowlem and Alfred McAlpine. It expanded into Canada and built a construction arm in the Middle East.</p>\n    <p>Carillion then diversified into outsourcing, taking on contracts such as running the mailroom at the Nationwide building society to helping upgrade UK broadband for BT Openreach. It took over running public service projects, ranging from prison and hospital maintenance to cooking school meals. In 2017 a third of its revenue \u2013 \u00a31.7bn \u2013 came from state contracts. It employs 43,000 people, with more than 19,000 in the UK.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong> Notable construction projects</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>\u2022 GCHQ government communications centre in Cheltenham (2003)</p>\n    <p>\u2022 Beetham Tower, Manchester (2006)</p>\n    <p>\u2022 HS1 (2007)</p>\n    <p>\u2022 London Olympics Media Centre - now BT Sport HQ (2011)</p>\n    <p>\u2022 Heathrow terminal 5 (2011)</p>\n    <p>\u2022 The Library of Birmingham (2013)</p>\n    <p>\u2022 Liverpool FC Anfield stadium expansion (2016)~</p>\n    <p>\u2022 Midland Metropolitan Hospital in Smethwick (due 2019)</p>\n    <p>\u2022 Aberdeen bypass (due 2018)</p>\n    <p>\u2022 Royal Liverpool University Hospital (due 2018, behind schedule)</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Government contracts</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>\u2022 NHS \u2013 managed 200 operating theatres; 11,800 beds; made 18,500 patient meals a day</p>\n    <p>\u2022 Transport \u2013 \u201csmart motorways\u201d to monitor traffic and ease congestion; work on HS2; track renewal for Network Rail; Crossrail contractor</p>\n    <p>\u2022 Defence \u2013 maintained 50,000 armed forces\u2019 houses; a \u00a3680m contract to provide 130 new buildings in Aldershot and Salisbury plain for troops returning from Germany</p>\n    <p>\u2022 Education \u2013 cleaning and meals for 875 schools</p>\n    <p>\u2022 Prisons \u2013 maintained 50% of UK prisons.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>Suppliers and small firms</strong></h2> \n<p>Carillion <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/15/jobs-carillion-liquidation-construction-hs2\">subcontracted much of its private and public sector work</a> \u2013 from cleaning to landscaping \u2013 to an estimated 30,000 small companies, many hired for their specialist expertise. </p> \n<p>It was also a notorious late payer, according to the Federation of Small Businesses. That means many companies that were already operating on wafer-thin margins have lost a lucrative client that owed them money. </p> \n<p>Court documents revealed last month that those companies are unlikely to get anything back, at most a penny in the pound. Writing off these outstanding bills could mean firing people, or even <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/05/carillions-fall-will-bring-down-more-construction-firms-say-accountants\">threaten the survival</a> of small businesses.</p> \n<p>The British Business Bank is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/03/carillion-government-to-back-loans-to-firms-struggling-contractors\">providing \u00a3100m in loans</a> to affected firms, while high street banks have agreed to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/18/carillion-taskforce-to-discuss-how-to-prevent-domino-effect-on-uk-economy\">provide \u00a3225m of assistance</a> such as overdraft extensions and loan repayment holidays. But reports are already emerging that these facilities are taking a long time to be approved.</p> \n<h2><strong>Big business</strong></h2> \n<p>Larger firms that worked with Carillion, or were its competitors, have also been affected. Rival outsourcing firms have seen their share prices tumble amid mounting concern among investors about the general outlook for the sector.</p> \n<p>One rare winner is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/sercogroup\">Serco</a>, in the midst of its own financial recovery plan under the leadership of Winston Churchill\u2019s grandson Rupert Soames. Serco agreed to buy contracts to manage NHS facilities from Carillion last year for \u00a348m but will now pay 38% less.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"50b9c1e7-4287-4685-a405-4f9c8e463f6d\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>NHS<br>\u2022 Managed facilities including 200 operating theatres and 11,800 beds<br>\u2022 Made more than 18,500 patient meals per day<br>\u2022 Helpdesks dealt with 1.5m calls per year<br>\u2022 Engineering teams carrying out maintenance work</p>\n    <p>Transport<br>\u2022 Built 'smart motorways' \u2013 which ease congestion by monitoring traffic and adjusting lanes or speed limits \u2013 for the Highways Agency<br>\u2022 Major contractor on \u00a356bn HS2 high-speed rail project<br>\u2022 Upgraded track and power lines for Network Rail<br>\u2022 Major contractor on London\u2019s Crossrail project<br>\u2022 Roadbuilding and bridges</p>\n    <p>Defence<br>\u2022 Managed infrastructure and 50,000 homes for Ministry of Defence</p>\n    <p>Education<br>\u2022 Designed and built 150 schools<br>\u2022 Catering and cleaning contracts at 875 schools</p>\n    <p>Prisons<br>\u2022 Maintenance and repairs at about half of UK prisons</p>\n    <p>Libraries<br>\u2022 Managed several public libraries in England</p>\n    <p>Energy<br>\u2022 Built substations, overhead cables and other works for National Grid</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The UK\u2019s largest construction firm Balfour Beatty was working with Galliford Try on the Aberdeen bypass project and has said Carillion\u2019s collapse could cost it up to \u00a345m.</p> \n<h2><strong>The inquiries</strong></h2> \n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/16/carillion-small-firms-losses-liquidation-jobs\">joint inquiry</a> has already begun, led by MPs on the work and pensions select committee and their counterparts on the business committee. They have demanded answers from pension regulators and trustees involved in Carillion\u2019s retirement schemes. </p> \n<p>They have also procured evidence from the big four accountancy firms, whom they <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/13/carillion-accountants-accused-of-feasting-on-company\">accused of \u201cfeasting\u201d on Carillion</a>, pointing to \u00a372m in fees those firms billed over the 10 years leading up to its collapse. </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/13/carillion-accountants-accused-of-feasting-on-company\">Carillion: accountants accused of 'feasting' on company</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The auditor KPMG will face questions next week. In evidence to the committee, the firm said it could not have seen the collapse coming, pointing to the speed at which things can go wrong in construction. MPs are expected to ask why it deserved \u00a320m in fees if it was so powerless to spot the iceberg ahead.</p> \n<p>The biggest fireworks from the inquiry so far came during evidence sessions with former Carillion directors, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/06/carillion-director-mp-executives-collapse\">who were branded \u201cdelusional\u201d</a> by Field and Reeves. Asked during the session if they would voluntarily hand back bonuses, they declined to do so.</p> \n<p>An inquiry by the Financial Conduct Authority is also under way, looking at the veracity of Carillion\u2019s statements to the stock market, while the Financial Reporting Council is examining whether KPMG might have been at fault.</p> \n<p>The business secretary, Greg Clark, asked the Insolvency Service to fast-track an investigation into the conduct of Carillion\u2019s current and former directors. \u201cAny evidence of misconduct will be taken very seriously,\u201d he warned.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/feb/03/pfi-carillion-capita-critical-list-outsourcing\">After Carillion and Capita, is PFI itself on the critical list?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<h2><strong>Large-scale projects</strong></h2> \n<p>In many cases the work that Carillion was doing in the public and private sectors has carried on more or less uninterrupted. The Insolvency Service has found some new contractors, or is paying for work to continue as normal in vital public services such as school catering. </p> \n<p>The future is less certain for two multimillion pound hospital projects, the Royal Liverpool University hospital, and the Midland Metropolitan hospital in Birmingham. Work stopped on those projects after Carillion\u2019s liquidation and they are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/19/carillion-collapse-expected-to-further-delay-building-at-two-major-hospitals\">now facing fresh delays</a>, having already been postponed. </p> \n<p>These were among the projects that brought Carillion\u2019s financial problems to a head \u2013 and that could make finding new contractors difficult and expensive.</p> \n<h2><strong>The pensioners</strong></h2> \n<p>Carillion grew fast by taking over companies, including Alfred McAlpine, Mowlem and George Wimpey. Each deal brought with it a pension scheme, and the combined schemes, which have nearly 30,000 members, are estimated to be at least \u00a3990m in deficit. </p> \n<p>The government\u2019s pensions lifeboat, the Pension Protection Fund (PPF), is expected to assume a liability of up to \u00a3900m, its largest ever. It has enough money to do that, but scheme members will face payout cuts of about 15%. </p>",

      "bodyText": "Get ready for phase two of Wall Street\u2019s wobble. That was the fearful advice when the latest American inflation figures provided evidence that underlying cost of living pressures were surfacing in the world\u2019s biggest economy. The thinking seemed impeccable. When shares were plunging last week the reason was that the markets thought rising inflation would prompt the Federal Reserve \u2013 the US central bank \u2013 into a series of interest rate rises this year. That assumption was certainly not challenged by figures showing that core inflation in the latest three months has been running at its highest annualised rate in more than six years. Likewise, Wall Street spent last week closely monitoring the yield on 10-year Treasury bonds, a key measure of long-term interest rates. Investors think the trigger for a real sell-off in equities will be when the 10-year bond yield hits 3%. After the inflation data was released it rose to just under 2.9%. All of which shows that there is no rhyme or reason to financial markets, because shares were up on Wall Street in early trading. Even though inflation was stronger than the markets had been expecting, this could be a classic example of buy the rumour, sell the fact. Markets had always assumed that the Fed would raise rates next month. This, though, is not an entirely convincing explanation because the real concern for Wall Street is how many more rate rises the Fed will deem necessary after the March hike. The central bank is worried not just about rising core inflation but also about the impact of Donald Trump\u2019s tax cuts, which it thinks will lead to stronger demand, a bigger budget deficit, weaker dollar and higher imported cost pressures. What does all that mean? It means there is a risk of one rate rise a quarter in 2018, a process that will eventually mean slower growth and lower corporate profits. That will not be good for Wall Street. Shovels at Persimmon A good piece of advice for anybody in public life is that if you are in hole the best course of action is to stop digging. But Jeff Fairburn, chief executive of the housebuilder Persimmon, is still shovelling like mad. Fairburn became caught up in a public relations firestorm after it was revealed that he stood to trouser a \u00a3110m bonus, not because of his own managerial brilliance but because Persimmon made lots of money from the government\u2019s taxpayer funded Help to Buy scheme. The bonus plan, set up before Fairburn joined the company, was linked to the company\u2019s share price and was uncapped, which explained the size of the payout. Fairburn\u2019s initial response was the L\u2019Oreal defence; he and his fellow executives were getting the bonuses because they were worth it. Move along, please, no story here. Since then, though, he has second thoughts. He has issued a statement saying that he did not ask for the bonuses to be paid and did not think it right he should be getting them. He was planning all along to give a large chunk of the money to his favourite charities. In his statement, Fairburn says he is an old-fashioned sort of guy who thought this business a private matter between him and his conscience, but in the light of everything that has happened he has decided to let the world know about his largesse. Well, after a fashion. There is no detail about what the charities are or when they are likely to get Fairburn\u2019s donations. Most significantly of all, he does not reveal how much of the \u00a3112m he is going to forego. In years to come, Fairburn\u2019s case is likely to be shown to budding PRs as an example of how not to do it. Far too little. Far too late. Wasteland recedes for BOE Those convinced that the economy has been turned into a wasteland as a consequence of the Brexit vote might like to cheer themselves up by reading the latest report from the Bank of England agents, who act as the eyes and ears of Threadneedle Street in the UK\u2019s regions. The latest report showed activity holding steady at a modest pace, firms having trouble filling posts, exports of goods rising, firms investing more in automation and robots to improve efficiency, and wage growth picking up, in part because of the impact of the minimum wage. Not a lot of evidence, in fact, to suggest that the economy is about to hit the wall. Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

Not a lot of evidence, in fact, to suggest that the economy is about to hit the wall. </p> <ul> <li><em>Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BusinessDesk\">@BusinessDesk</a>, or sign up to the daily Business Today email <a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/info/2017/may/16/guardian-business-today-sign-up-financial-news-email?CMP=business_footnote\">here</a>.</em><br></li> </ul>",

      "bodyText": "The Goldman Sachs boss, Lloyd Blankfein, has added his voice to the chorus warning that Donald Trump\u2019s $1.5tn tax cut and spending plans could lead to an overheated US economy. \u201cThe odds of a bad outcome have gone up,\u201d Blankfein told CNN on Wednesday. Trump outlined a budget this week that could add $7tn to the nation\u2019s debt over the next decade. Blankfein warned that over-stimulating an already healthy economy could prove \u201ctoo much of a good thing\u201d. \u201cDon\u2019t forget, all of these deficits have to be paid for,\u201d he said. Blankfein said the current upbeat mood reminded him of the optimism that preceded the global financial crisis of 2007-8. \u201cWhat could possibly go wrong? I haven\u2019t felt this good since 2006,\u201d he joked. \u201cIf the economy starts to overheat, and the Fed feels that it\u2019s behind on inflation, it will need to act,\u201d he added. Blankfein stopped short of issuing an-all out warning. But \u201cwith the Fed raising rates, with the withdrawal of QE, with the budget deficit widening out, I wouldn\u2019t say this is the time I would max out on my risk.\u201d Over the past 10 days, Wall Street has been reacting spasmodically to Trump\u2019s economic stimulus measures and clear signals from the Fed that it will raise interest rates to in an effort to counter signs that inflation could soon outstrip the Fed\u2019s 2% target. The Dow Jones industrial average is up about 5,000 points since Trump took office \u2013 a figure that takes into account more than 2,000 point drop since its late January high. At the same time, fears of inflation are intensifying. On Wednesday, the labor department announced that consumer prices rose 0.5% in January, the most in four months. The annual rate of headline inflation of 2.1% for January was stronger than the consensus forecast of 1.9%. However, the core gauge of consumer prices, which excludes energy and food, stayed steady at 1.8%. Market analysts had expected core inflation to slip to 1.7%. In an investor newsletter, Capital Economics warned on Wednesday that any respite for the US stock market was \u201clikely to be short-lived\u201d as inflation continued to increase. \u201cIn particular, we expect core inflation to rise to around 2.2% in the spring, and to trend higher from there.\u201d It added that despite revising their expectations for interest rate rises, investors \u201care still underestimating how quickly the Fed will raise interest rates in response to core price pressures\u201d. Sharp jumps in interest rates based on increasing inflation is precisely what investors fear, and there are signs that selling on the equity markets is lifting the yield on 10-year treasury bonds from 2.4% at the start of 2018 to around 2.85% today.",

    "webTitle": "Markets nervous again as US inflation unexpectedly spikes higher - as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "After a calm start to the day in the run-up to US inflation data, markets turned nervous again as the numbers came in much stronger than expected. The year on year headline consumer price index figure showed a rise of 2.1% for January, unchanged from December, rather than a fall of 1.9%. The news prompted renewed concerns that the Federal Reserve could raise interest rates more quickly than expected, despite another set of data showing disappointing US retail sales. But there was not the panic or volatility seen at times in some recent trading sessions. So on Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 55 points having lost as much as 150 points initially. European markets fell back in the immediate aftermath of the US figures but have since edged back into positive territory. The FTSE 100 is up 0.7%, Germany\u2019s Dax has added 0.3% and France\u2019s Cac has climbed 0.45%. Earlier eurozone industrial production beat expectations while GDP growth for the fourth quarter was in line with forecasts. In the UK, businesses expect wage settlements to pick up in 2018 according to the Bank of England\u2019s latest agents\u2019 report. But the IMF said the UK had to do more to boost its productivity. On that note it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Here\u2019s Andrew Wilson of Goldman Sachs Asset Management on the inflation numbers: Recent market turbulence highlights market sensitivity to firmer price and wage data, however we do not think investors should wed their investment outlook to today\u2019s data alone, not least given it is clouded by methodology changes and weather-related distortions. Today\u2019s firmer-than-expected print, which is in some sense encouraging given it reflects a normalisation in components that have been notably weak, may extend recent market volatility, as expectations for Fed rate hikes are recalibrated higher. In our view, market-pricing for Fed policy understates the solid macro backdrop, including a 17-year low unemployment rate, and the impact of fiscal stimulus, and we think there is scope for more rate hikes this year than the Fed\u2019s current projection for three. That said, we think today\u2019s data should viewed in conjunction with PCE inflation\u2013 the Fed\u2019s preferred measure of prices \u2013 and wages, which were the culprit for the recent volatility spike, which will be released at the start of next month. The Dow is now down 130 points but the mood seems calmer than might perhaps have been expected. The FTSE 100 has actually recovered ground after an initial slide in the immediate aftermath of the higher than forecast US inflation numbers. It is now up 40 points or 0.54%. Germany\u2019s Dax is effectively flat, while France\u2019s Cac has climbed 0.2%. The higher than expected inflation figures have put pressure on Wall Street in early trading, as rate hike fears resurface. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down around 100 points while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite opened down around 0.36%. Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, said: Dow and S&amp;P500 futures tanked after the US CPI inflation numbers beat forecasts, signalling that this inflation-triggered selloff could have further to run. As previously noted there was not a huge amount of conviction in the bounce so the market is susceptible to further weakness and the inflation data is supplying plenty of reason to de-risk... Coming off the back of the 2.9% increase in average hourly earnings, this CPI print will crystallise the prevailing view in the market that we are heading for higher rates and higher inflation. Whether or not this is sustained will be proved in due course and no one can predict the trajectory of travel, or the destination, but the warning lights are flashing and equity markets are taking notice. On the other hand retail sales were dreadful. January retail sales posted the biggest decline in 11 months while most concerning of all December data was revised to show sales were flat versus the previous reading of +0.4%. Aggregate demand may not be what it seems. What\u2019s most concerning about this is the risk of stagflation \u2013 rising inflation and slower growth. Combined the picture is not a good one for risk today. US economist Jay Shambaugh on the inflation figures: Soft retail sales could be a temporary phenomenon but higher inflation is not, says economist James Knightley at ING Bank: The US data has provided quite a few surprises. Inflation rates have held steady at 2.1% for annual headline consumer price inflation and 1.8% for ex food &amp; energy, rather than fall to 1.9% and 1.7% respectively as the consensus had predicted. Meanwhile retail sales were far softer than expected, falling 0.3%MoM versus forecasts of a 0.2% rise. Starting with inflation, the main surprise came in apparel, which rose 1.7%MoM. We had suspected it would rebound at some point given its very soft run, but not quite as quickly (it is the biggest increase in more than 10 years). Energy also rose sharply \u2013 up 3%MoM, while medical care rose 0.4% (fastest growth for 6M). As for retail sales there was a wide range of forecasts (the Bloomberg survey had numbers ranging from -0.2% to +0.5%), which presumably reflected the uncertainty relating to bad weather at the very beginning of the year. We had thought there would be a switch to internet sales, but it wasn\u2019t enough to offset the big fall in auto sales (-1.3%MoM). Building materials (-2.4%MoM), health (-1.2%) and sporting (-0.8%) were all weak, but clothing was up 1.2% and gasoline sales were up 1.6%. We think the softness in retail sales is temporary. With tax cuts, record low unemployment, rising wages and high confidence levels meaning the outlook for spending remains good. However, we think there could be more bad news for inflation. The dollar\u2019s declines will gradually push up import prices, while energy costs will add to the upside. Then there are last year\u2019s distortions relating to cell phone data plans dropping out of the annual comparisons from March. This on its own will add 0.2/0.3 percentage points to annual core inflation with medical care costs and housing costs pushing inflation higher too. In an environment of strong consumer demand, corporates have the pricing power to pass on higher costs to customers which is going to be increasingly significant given the prospect of a pick-up in wage growth. Taking this altogether we expect core inflation to be back above the Federal Reserve\u2019s 2% target in March with headline inflation hitting 3% by the summer. In turn this healthy growth, rising inflation environment means that we consider there to be upside risk for our call of three Fed rate hikes in 2018. If US inflation was higher than expected, then the retail sales figures are below forecast. They fell 0.3% in January, according to the Commerce Department, recording their biggest fall since February 2017. Analysts had been expecting an increase of 0.2%. Meanwhile December\u2019s figures were revised down from a rise of 0.4% to an unchanged reading. The poor retail sales figures contrast with the inflation figures in terms of when the Federal Reserve might take further action on interest rates. And analysts say the real key piece of data will be the February wages figures: More on the inflation figures: The higher than expected US consumer price index data has rekindled fears that the Federal Reserve could raise interest rates more quickly than expected, and sent another shudder through stock markets. With Treasury yields rising, share prices are again under pressure. Wall Street is now expected to open sharply lower and European markets have lost their early gains. The FTSE 100 is down a handful of points while Germany\u2019s Dax is down 0.3%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average futures have gone into reverse, indicating a 200 point fall. Immediately before the inflation data, they were showing a 168 point rise. The US inflation data the market has been waiting for is out, and it has come in higher than expected. The headline figure rose by 0.5% month on month in December, compared to expectations of an increase of 0.3%. The year on year figure was steady at 2.1%, compared to forecasts of a fall to 1.9%. Markets are still holding up well ahead of the US inflation numbers, but what happens after that is anyone\u2019s guess. Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at Forex.com, said: If the numbers show stronger-than-expected readings, then this would reinforce expectations that the Federal Reserve will have little choice but to tighten monetary policy more aggressively. As a result, we may see renewed selling pressure coming into the bond and stock markets, while the dollar could rise against her weaker rivals. Alternatively, however, if the data releases fall significantly short of expectations, then we would expect to see the opposite happen. And finally, if the data matches expectations then it is hard to say exactly how the markets would react, although we do think that the dollar may rise anyway but not too sure about the equity and bond markets\u2019 reaction. More on US inflation. Ken Odeluga, market analyst at City Index, says: Rightly or wrongly, U.S. inflation data due this afternoon has come to be seen as a litmus test of whether or not economic conditions continue to support equity market advances. With few major stock indices extending their recent correction much beyond 10% from January highs, market participants are wary that any overshoot in price growth relative to expectations could upset still-fragile sentiment anew. The view is a little \u2018totemic\u2019, of course. Quite aside from the old truism around not over-emphasising one, or even a few data points, evidence linking long-term interest rates to inflation rates is notoriously sketchy, meaning markets should discount any short-term impact on rate expectations from inflation changes. Markets are not like that though. Any upside surprises against the 1.9% year-to-year print expected (down from December\u2019s 2.1%), and more importantly 1.7% and 0.2% core annualised and monthly forecasts respectively, will trigger a quick re-think for risky assets. Potential March and May Fed rate rises have probabilities between 75%-77% according to fund futures and they\u2019re now largely been priced into U.S. equities. So the focus is on whether projections of further tightening by the Fed in later months will be vindicated by economic readings in the run-up. Markets could certainly get themselves into lather on the notion that inflation greenlights the full clip of hikes the Fed has cued up It\u2019s notable that whilst the imperfect barometer of U.S. equity market anxiety, the Vix, has inevitably ebbed from spike highs notched when selling reached fever pitch, it remains within the notional \u2018fear zone\u2019 above 20. Even if markets take signs of brewing inflation in their stride, we would not interpret the mood as having completely dispelled crisis anxieties until the Vix crosses below that marker. Markets remain in a good mood so far today, but the real test is yet to come, says Spreadex financial analyst Connor Campbell: It is going to be interesting to see how investors deal with the various US inflation readings this afternoon. While the headline figure is set to jump from 0.1% to 0.3%, the core number is expected to drop from 0.3% to 0.2%. If the focus is on the former then the markets could be in store for another interest rate-fearing freak-out; if it\u2019s on the latter then the global indices can breathe a (temporary) sigh of relief. Of course, this is without even considering whether or not these estimates will turn out to be accurate... At present the Dow Jones doesn\u2019t look too worried, with the futures pointing to a 130-ish point rise when the bell rings on Wall Street. That would leave the Dow not too far from 24800, its best price in around a week. To confuse things more, the year on year figures are expected to show a dip on the headline rate from 2.1% to 1.9%. The core figure, excluding food and energy, is forecast to fall from 1.8% to 1.7%. The eurozone economy is expected to remain strong after the 2017 performance, says economist Bert Colijn at ING Bank: Growth in the Eurozone economy was broad-based. Germany and Spain maintained strong economic growth with 0.6% and 0.7% QoQ respectively, although this was slightly lower than in Q3 for both economies. Italy disappointed somewhat with just 0.3% growth and continues to lag the Eurozone average despite optimistic data released during the quarter. This rounds out a year in which the Eurozone economy was helped by strong tailwinds and the question is how long these growth rates can be maintained. Even though the ECB has reduced asset purchases, the euro has appreciated against the dollar and politics remains a factor of uncertainty, leading indicators are still pointing to a very strong start to the year. Eurozone industry is a good example of a sector with still has a lot of upside left. As manufacturing surveys have been jubilant recently, industrial production was due to surprise positively. December saw a jump to 5.2% annual growth led by capital- and durable consumer goods production. The acceleration of production growth is unlikely to be a one-off as the outlook for industry remains rosy. Manufacturing businesses are indicating that production for almost four months has been assured by current orders, which is around record highs. Growth in new orders has accelerated over the past six months, which means that expectations for production at the beginning of 2018 are high. Given the current backlog of work in industry, it is no surprise that hiring and investment in capital goods are high on the list of businesses. This adds to the strong economic picture for the start of 2018. Meanwhile the EY Item club has raised its forecast for UK economic growth this year from 1.4% to 1.7%. More signs of the strength of Europe\u2019s economy. Eurozone industrial production rose by a better than expected 0.4% in December compared to the previous month, with an annual gain of 5.2%. Analysts had been forecasting rises of 0.2% and 4.2% respectively. Meanwhile the EU statistics office Eurostat confirmed that eurozone GDP rose by 2.5% in 2017, the fastest growth rate for a decade. During the fourth quarter, GDP rose by 0.6% in both the euro area and the wider European Union in the fourth quarter compared to the previous three months. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, eurozone GDP increased by 2.7% and EU GDP by 2.6%. Businesses expect average pay settlements to pick up this year, according to the latest Bank of England regional agents\u2019 report. Companies think pay settlements will increase from 2.6% in 2017 to 3.1% this year, with rises broadly based across most sectors. Only construction companies expect pay rises to be flat this year. The Bank said: The survey indicated that companies expected an average pay settlement rate of 3.1% in 2018, compared with 2.6% in 2017. The 2017 outturn was higher than the 2.2% that had been expected in last year\u2019s survey, reflecting larger settlements across a broad range of sectors. The increases in pay settlements in 2018 are also expected to be broad-based, with only the construction sector expecting pay settlements in 2018 to be the same as in 2017. Other conclusions from the report: Growth in activity had held steady at a modest pace. Professional services firms had reported a pickup in growth; goods export volumes had strengthened, construction output growth had continued to slow. Investment intentions had remained positive, but mainly reflected investment to maintain business activity. Recruitment difficulties had remained at an elevated level Over in Italy, the latest growth figures came in slightly less than expected. Fourth quarter GDP rose by 0.3% quarter on quarter, down from the 0.4% recorded in the previous three months and expected to be repeated this time round. But over the whole of 2017, Italy\u2019s economy grew by 1.4%, the strongest performance for seven years. The IMF has some suggestions as to how the UK could improve its productivity: Build more homes, including by easing planning restrictions. Housing is very expensive in the UK. With more houses available, they would become more affordable and it would be less costly for workers to move between regions to take better-paying jobs. That would improve living standards and reduce inequality. Improve the quality of infrastructure. Transportation bottlenecks and other infrastructure problems hold back development in regions with lower productivity. Better connectivity would help reduce regional inequalities and support growth. Reform the education system. UK students rank low on tests of basic skills, while UK firms continue reporting shortages of skilled workers, including those with technical education. Better schooling would help young people find jobs, especially once they have obtained a degree. Unemployment rates are the lowest among those with the highest levels of education. Invest in research. Public and private spending on research and development in the UK is relatively low. Increasing such investments would make local companies better able to compete internationally. Britain should give priority to improving its productivity performance, according to the latest assessment from the International Monetary Fund. Following a consulation in the wake of December\u2019s annual health check on the UK economy when it defended its gloomy predictions for the country\u2019s post-Brexit vote performance, the IMF said: Economic growth has moderated since the beginning of 2017, reflecting weakening domestic demand. The sharp depreciation of sterling following the referendum has raised consumer price inflation, squeezing household real income and consumption. Business investment has been constrained. In the medium term, growth is projected to remain at around 1.5 percent under the baseline assumption of continued progress in Brexit negotiations that lead to an understanding on a broad free trade agreement and on the transition process. The baseline outlook is subject to a number of risks, including developments with Brexit negotiations; uncertainty about the recovery of productivity growth, which has been weak since the crisis; and the current account deficit, which reached a record high in 2016. The IMF added: Directors agreed that structural reforms should prioritize enhancing productivity, inclusiveness, and external competitiveness... Since the financial crisis, output growth has been underpinned by strong increases in employment, while productivity growth has been very weak. With the UK unemployment rate at a 42-year low and the annual net inflow of workers from the EU already declining, the scope for future employment gains is more limited. Therefore, economic performance will depend increasingly on the ability of firms to raise output per worker. The shape of the new agreement with the EU will affect productivity performance through its implications for trade, investment and migration. The higher are any new barriers to the cross-border flow of services, goods and workers, the more negative the impact would be. European markets continue to move higher, while US futures are suggesting a positive opening on Wall Street. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: Despite the prospect of some hawkish US inflation data later this afternoon the European indices got off to a strong start this Wednesday. The FTSE, which showed some much needed resilience in the face of the UK\u2019s own sky-high inflation figure on Tuesday, rose 40 points after the bell, allowing the index to crawl back over the 7200 mark it has struggled with in the last few sessions. It helped that the pound wasn\u2019t particularly energetic. Sterling failed to make the most out of yesterday\u2019s January\u2019s 3.0% inflation reading, and is continuing to look out of ideas this Wednesday. Against the dollar the pound is up just 0.1%, failing to cross the $1.39 levels briefly seen on Tuesday, while against the euro it has slipped a further 0.1%, leaving it to tease a fresh one month low. After wilting in the face of the euro\u2019s strength on Tuesday the Eurozone indices are clearly in a better mood. The DAX rose 0.6%, sending it back towards 12300, with the CAC and IBEX both climbing 0.4%. Still to come is the region-wide flash Q4 GDP reading, expected to come in unchanged from the previous estimate at 0.6%. As mentioned, Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 is in the red, mainly due to continuing strength in the yen. The Japanese currency is benefiting from a weaker dollar, despite slower than expected growth. The country\u2019s latest GDP figures showed the economy expanded by an annualised 0.5% in the three months to December, below the forecast 0.9%. After last night\u2019s recovery on Wall Street - which was not followed up in Japan where the Nikkei 225 is in negative territory - European markets have made a bright start. The FTSE 100 is up 46 points or 0.65%, Germany\u2019s Dax has opened 0.9% higher, France\u2019s Cac has climbed 0.5% and Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB has recovered 0.7%. Among the movers in the UK market, Sky has climbed 3% after it won the bulk of the Premier League rights in the latest top flight football auction. But Galliford Try has dropped 14% as the construction group said it planned to raise \u00a3150m from investors. It said the collapse of Carillion had increased its cash commitments on a joint venture in Aberdeen by that amount, and it did not want to divert funds from other projects to cover the payment. Meanwhile Serco has added 1% after it said it would pay \u00a329.7m for a portfolio of health facilities management contracts from Carillion, less than the original cost of \u00a347.7m agreed before Carillion\u2019s liquidation. More on the German GDP figures. The country\u2019s economy grew by 0.6% quarter on quarter in the final three months of 2017, in line with expectations. The figures were boosted by strong exports, according to the statistics agency, albeit growth was slower than the 0.7% recorded in the previous quarter. Over the entire year, the economy grew by 2.2%, the strongest performance since 2011. Economist Carsten Brzeski at ING Bank called it an impressive performance, but warned of the political risks ahead: The strong 4Q performance also means that without any growth in the next four quarters, annual GDP growth in 2018 would come in close to 1%. Looking ahead, the same fundamentals which have supported growth in 2016 and 2017 should still be in place in 2018. The only question is how much additional stimulus low interest rates, the strong labour market and the recent upswing of the entire Eurozone economy can still provide to the mature cycle of the German economy. In our view, still a lot. The German economy still has some upward potential as the output gap is positive but not extraordinary high compared with previous cycles, capacity utilisation is above its historical average but still lower than in 2007 and investments have only started to increase this year. Judging from previous cycles, the economy could continue its current pace for at least one or two more years, without showing signs of overheating. Obviously, there are also risks to this positive outlook for the German economy, just think of a protectionist wave coming from the US, a sharp appreciation of the euro or renewed political tensions, geopolitically, in the Eurozone or domestically. Interestingly, the last one has clearly moved up on the scale from \u201cremote\u201d to \u201cclear possibility\u201d. ...These days, Germany clearly shows two different faces: the well-known one of a strong and high-performing economy and the unknown one of fragile politics. It looks as if in the future any German Schadenfreude on political chaos in other European countries will be very muted. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Much of the recent market turmoil came after US wages growth was stronger than expected, prompting talk of rising inflation and the prospect of central banks increasing interest rates and withdrawing financial stimulus more quickly than previously expected. With that in mind, today\u2019s US consumer price index data will be closely watched to see if inflationary pressures are indeed picking up. And even though the Federal Reserve does not take much account of the CPI measure when determining interest rate policy, there is enough nervousness around that a stronger than expected figure could have repercussions for stock markets. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: Today\u2019s US CPI inflation report has taken on an importance all of its own in the wake of the recently strong wages numbers, never mind the fact that the Fed doesn\u2019t even use CPI to target inflation. Nonetheless this renewed focus on inflation, not only in the US but more globally has raised concerns that central banks may well be behind the curve when it comes to assessing the outlook for the next few months... Much importance is being attached to today\u2019s US January CPI report, however it is unlikely to tell us too much more than what we already know about inflationary pressure in the US economy. Various ISM prices paid surveys are telling us that prices are rising at their highest levels since 2011, yet thus far we haven\u2019t seen much evidence of it in the headline numbers. Even now indications are for CPI to slip back to 1.9% from 2.1%, while retail sales for January are expected to show a rise of 0.2%, a modest slowdown from the 0.4% rise seen in December. Jasper Lawler at London Capital Group said: Today\u2019s US CPI release will be one on the most closely watched data prints in recent times. Let\u2019s not forget that the recent rout in equities started with a surprising acceleration in US earnings growth, which promoted fears that inflation may pick up soon, which in turn sent treasury yields higher. Should these fears be played out today in an unexpected strengthening in inflation, then a renewed sell off in equities and bonds could be on the cards and the dollar could benefit. With so much riding on the CPI data, we are expecting a very cautious morning of trading in general. Markets have been reasonably calm so far this week, with Wall Street recovering from early losses yesterday to end higher for the third day. Europe is expected to open higher when trading begins shortly. Here are IG\u2019s opening calls: Apart from the US data, we also have German GPD figures, which are in line with expectations, as well as eurozone growth data. Meanwhile the International Monetary Fund is due to release its latest assessment of the UK shortly.

Inflation rates have held steady at 2.1% for annual headline consumer price inflation and 1.8% for ex food &amp; energy, rather than fall to 1.9% and 1.7% respectively as the consensus had predicted. Meanwhile retail sales were far softer than expected, falling 0.3%MoM versus forecasts of a 0.2% rise.</p> <p>Starting with inflation, the main surprise came in apparel, which rose 1.7%MoM. We had suspected it would rebound at some point given its very soft run, but not quite as quickly (it is the biggest increase in more than 10 years). Energy also rose sharply \u2013 up 3%MoM, while medical care rose 0.4% (fastest growth for 6M).</p> <p>As for retail sales there was a wide range of forecasts (the Bloomberg survey had numbers ranging from -0.2% to +0.5%), which presumably reflected the uncertainty relating to bad weather at the very beginning of the year. We had thought there would be a switch to internet sales, but it wasn\u2019t enough to offset the big fall in auto sales (-1.3%MoM). Building materials (-2.4%MoM), health (-1.2%) and sporting (-0.8%) were all weak, but clothing was up 1.2% and gasoline sales were up 1.6%.</p> <p>We think the softness in retail sales is temporary. With tax cuts, record low unemployment, rising wages and high confidence levels meaning the outlook for spending remains good. However, we think there could be more bad news for inflation. The dollar\u2019s declines will gradually push up import prices, while energy costs will add to the upside. Then there are last year\u2019s distortions relating to cell phone data plans dropping out of the annual comparisons from March. This on its own will add 0.2/0.3 percentage points to annual core inflation with medical care costs and housing costs pushing inflation higher too.</p> <p>In an environment of strong consumer demand, corporates have the pricing power to pass on higher costs to customers which is going to be increasingly significant given the prospect of a pick-up in wage growth. Taking this altogether we expect core inflation to be back above the Federal Reserve\u2019s 2% target in March with headline inflation hitting 3% by the summer. In turn this healthy growth, rising inflation environment means that we consider there to be upside risk for our call of three Fed rate hikes in 2018.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a843e9ce4b05f3d2b6e0977\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-02-14T13:54:00.339Z\">1.54pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">US retail sales drop sharply</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>If US inflation was higher than expected, then the retail sales figures are below forecast.</p> <p>They fell 0.3% in January, according to the Commerce Department, recording their biggest fall since February 2017.

Ken Odeluga, market analyst at City Index, says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Rightly or wrongly, U.S. inflation data due this afternoon has come to be seen as a litmus test of whether or not economic conditions continue to support equity market advances. With few major stock indices extending their recent correction much beyond 10% from January highs, market participants are wary that any overshoot in price growth relative to expectations could upset still-fragile sentiment anew. The view is a little \u2018totemic\u2019, of course. Quite aside from the old truism around not over-emphasising one, or even a few data points, evidence linking long-term interest rates to inflation rates is notoriously sketchy, meaning markets should discount any short-term impact on rate expectations from inflation changes.</p> <p>Markets are not like that though. Any upside surprises against the 1.9% year-to-year print expected (down from December\u2019s 2.1%), and more importantly 1.7% and 0.2% core annualised and monthly forecasts respectively, will trigger a quick re-think for risky assets. </p> <p>Potential March and May Fed rate rises have probabilities between 75%-77% according to fund futures and they\u2019re now largely been priced into U.S. equities. So the focus is on whether projections of further tightening by the Fed in later months will be vindicated by economic readings in the run-up. Markets could certainly get themselves into lather on the notion that inflation greenlights the full clip of hikes the Fed has cued up</p> <p>It\u2019s notable that whilst the imperfect barometer of U.S. equity market anxiety, the Vix, has inevitably ebbed from spike highs notched when selling reached fever pitch, it remains within the notional \u2018fear zone\u2019 above 20. Even if markets take signs of brewing inflation in their stride, we would not interpret the mood as having completely dispelled crisis anxieties until the Vix crosses below that marker.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a841d2de4b05f3d2b6e07a1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-02-14T11:32:12.585Z\">11.32am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Markets remain in a good mood so far today, but the real test is yet to come, says Spreadex financial analyst Connor Campbell:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It is going to be interesting to see how investors deal with the various US inflation readings this afternoon. While the headline figure is set to jump from 0.1% to 0.3%, the core number is expected to drop from 0.3% to 0.2%. </p> <p>If the focus is on the former then the markets could be in store for another interest rate-fearing freak-out; if it\u2019s on the latter then the global indices can breathe a (temporary) sigh of relief. Of course, this is without even considering whether or not these estimates will turn out to be accurate... </p> <p>At present the Dow Jones doesn\u2019t look too worried, with the futures pointing to a 130-ish point rise when the bell rings on Wall Street. That would leave the Dow not too far from 24800, its best price in around a week.</p> </blockquote> <p>To confuse things more, the year on year figures are expected to show a dip on the headline rate from 2.1% to 1.9%.

Italy disappointed somewhat with just 0.3% growth and continues to lag the Eurozone average despite optimistic data released during the quarter.</p> <p>This rounds out a year in which the Eurozone economy was helped by strong tailwinds and the question is how long these growth rates can be maintained. Even though the ECB has reduced asset purchases, the euro has appreciated against the dollar and politics remains a factor of uncertainty, leading indicators are still pointing to a very strong start to the year.</p> <p>Eurozone industry is a good example of a sector with still has a lot of upside left. As manufacturing surveys have been jubilant recently, industrial production was due to surprise positively. December saw a jump to 5.2% annual growth led by capital- and durable consumer goods production. The acceleration of production growth is unlikely to be a one-off as the outlook for industry remains rosy. Manufacturing businesses are indicating that production for almost four months has been assured by current orders, which is around record highs. Growth in new orders has accelerated over the past six months, which means that expectations for production at the beginning of 2018 are high. Given the current backlog of work in industry, it is no surprise that hiring and investment in capital goods are high on the list of businesses. This adds to the strong economic picture for the start of 2018.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a840258e4b01d21b8e8afcd\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-02-14T10:23:40.835Z\">10.23am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Meanwhile the EY Item club has raised its forecast for UK economic growth this year from 1.4% to 1.7%.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/HowardArcherUK/status/963700894645792768\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Our latest outlook got the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/UK?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#UK</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/economy?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#economy</a>.

That would improve living standards and reduce inequality.</li> <li><strong>Improve the quality of infrastructure.</strong> Transportation bottlenecks and other infrastructure problems hold back development in regions with lower productivity. Better connectivity would help reduce regional inequalities and support growth.</li> <li><strong>Reform the education system</strong><strong>. </strong>UK students rank low on tests of basic skills, while UK firms continue reporting shortages of skilled workers, including those with technical education. Better schooling would help young people find jobs, especially once they have obtained a degree. Unemployment rates are the lowest among those with the highest levels of education.</li> <li><strong>Invest in research. </strong>Public and private spending on research and development in the UK is relatively low. Increasing such investments would make local companies better able to compete internationally. <strong> <br></strong></li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/IMFNews/status/963703130939588608\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">UK has to resolve the problem of weak productivity of its economy.

The sharp depreciation of sterling following the referendum has raised consumer price inflation, squeezing household real income and consumption. Business investment has been constrained. In the medium term, growth is projected to remain at around 1.5 percent under the baseline assumption of continued progress in Brexit negotiations that lead to an understanding on a broad free trade agreement and on the transition process.</p> <p>The baseline outlook is subject to a number of risks, including developments with Brexit negotiations; uncertainty about the recovery of productivity growth, which has been weak since the crisis; and the current account deficit, which reached a record high in 2016.</p> </blockquote> <p>The IMF added:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Directors agreed that structural reforms should prioritize enhancing productivity, inclusiveness, and external competitiveness...</p> <p>Since the financial crisis, output growth has been underpinned by strong increases in employment, while productivity growth has been very weak. With the UK unemployment rate at a 42-year low and the annual net inflow of workers from the EU already declining, the scope for future employment gains is more limited. Therefore, economic performance will depend increasingly on the ability of firms to raise output per worker. The shape of the new agreement with the EU will affect productivity performance through its implications for trade, investment and migration. The higher are any new barriers to the cross-border flow of services, goods and workers, the more negative the impact would be. </p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e624eb3c9d8e3d1c531cf576ec2f8a31196b0212\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e624eb3c9d8e3d1c531cf576ec2f8a31196b0212/0_0_921_748/500.jpg\" alt=\"prodcutivity14feb\" width=\"500\" height=\"406\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a83f6bfe4b01d21b8e8af94\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-02-14T08:45:42.396Z\">8.45am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>European markets continue to move higher, while US futures are suggesting a positive opening on Wall Street.

The only question is how much additional stimulus low interest rates, the strong labour market and the recent upswing of the entire Eurozone economy can still provide to the mature cycle of the German economy. In our view, still a lot. The German economy still has some upward potential as the output gap is positive but not extraordinary high compared with previous cycles, capacity utilisation is above its historical average but still lower than in 2007 and investments have only started to increase this year. Judging from previous cycles, the economy could continue its current pace for at least one or two more years, without showing signs of overheating.</p> <p>Obviously, there are also risks to this positive outlook for the German economy, just think of a protectionist wave coming from the US, a sharp appreciation of the euro or renewed political tensions, geopolitically, in the Eurozone or domestically. Interestingly, the last one has clearly moved up on the scale from \u201cremote\u201d to \u201cclear possibility\u201d.</p> <p>...These days, Germany clearly shows two different faces: the well-known one of a strong and high-performing economy and the unknown one of fragile politics.

And even though the Federal Reserve does not take much account of the CPI measure when determining interest rate policy, there is enough nervousness around that a stronger than expected figure could have repercussions for stock markets.</p> <p>Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Today\u2019s US CPI inflation report has taken on an importance all of its own in the wake of the recently strong wages numbers, never mind the fact that the Fed doesn\u2019t even use CPI to target inflation.</p> <p>Nonetheless this renewed focus on inflation, not only in the US but more globally has raised concerns that central banks may well be behind the curve when it comes to assessing the outlook for the next few months...</p> <p>Much importance is being attached to today\u2019s US January CPI report, however it is unlikely to tell us too much more than what we already know about inflationary pressure in the US economy. Various ISM prices paid surveys are telling us that prices are rising at their highest levels since 2011, yet thus far we haven\u2019t seen much evidence of it in the headline numbers. </p> <p>Even now indications are for CPI to slip back to 1.9% from 2.1%, while retail sales for January are expected to show a rise of 0.2%, a modest slowdown from the 0.4% rise seen in December.</p> </blockquote> <p> Jasper Lawler at London Capital Group said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Today\u2019s US CPI release will be one on the most closely watched data prints in recent times. Let\u2019s not forget that the recent rout in equities started with a surprising acceleration in US earnings growth, which promoted fears that inflation may pick up soon, which in turn sent treasury yields higher. Should these fears be played out today in an unexpected strengthening in inflation, then a renewed sell off in equities and bonds could be on the cards and the dollar could benefit. With so much riding on the CPI data, we are expecting a very cautious morning of trading in general.</p> </blockquote> <p>Markets have been reasonably calm so far this week, with Wall Street recovering from early losses yesterday to end higher for the third day.

If you\u2019re operating on a tight budget it\u2019s crucial you know that payments will be processed more or less as you make them.\u201d</p> <p>In January Tesco <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/17/tesco-delays-clubcard-changes-customer-backlash-reward-loyalty-scheme\">announced </a>it was delaying changes to its Clubcard rewards scheme after a backlash from customers who objected to it reducing the value of vouchers without warning.</p> <p>The retailer said it had listened to the feedback and would postpone the introduction of the changes until 10 June. </p>",

      "bodyText": "British workers are set for the biggest annual pay rise in a decade, according to forecasts from the Bank of England\u2019s agents, as the rising minimum wage and staff shortages finally begin to lift wages above inflation. Companies expect to increase pay by 3.1% in 2018, compared with 2.6% last year, according to the latest survey of private-sector employers by the Bank\u2019s network of agents across the country. A total of 368 businesses responded to the survey carried out between late November and mid-January, accounting for 845,000 UK employees. The early indications for pay growth in the report, which is closely watched by rate-setters on the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee, suggest wages should begin to rise above the rate of inflation, which stood at 3% in January. The survey pointed to pay growth across the board, barring the construction sector, which is flirting with recession amid falling rates of work since the Brexit vote. Threadneedle Street has been looking for signs of pay growth in order to justify raising interest rates from the lowest level in a decade from as early as May. The central bank said this month it may need to increase the cost of borrowing earlier and to a greater extent than previously expected to counteract stubbornly high inflation. The Bank\u2019s governor, Mark Carney, has argued growth in workers\u2019 pay should begin to put pressure on inflation this year, offsetting a gradual fall in the rise in prices that took hold following the EU referendum, when the sudden drop in the pound pushed up the cost of importing food and fuel to Britain. The report said recruitment difficulties among firms was at an \u201celevated level\u201d and that the biggest pay rises were likely to come among consumer services firms, which are likely to have more workers on the minimum wage, which is set to rise from \u00a37.50 to \u00a37.83 from April. The findings of the report come after the International Monetary Fund issued a warning over the health of the UK economy as Britain leaves the EU, urging ministers to improve transport infrastructure, education and to spend more on research and development to offset the impact from Brexit. Warning that leaving the European Union stands to compound Britain\u2019s poor track-record in boosting worker productivity since the financial crisis, the fund said it was vital for ministers to focus on boosting efficiency levels at a time when private-sector investment is falling below expectations. It said the harder Brexit makes it for businesses to trade with the EU and to employ foreign workers, the more negative the impact will be for the economy. \u201cBrexit will not help resolve the problem of lackluster productivity,\u201d it added. The warning comes as the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, mounts a renewed defence of Brexit with a major speech. It also comes after the government launched an industrial strategy late last year to boost spending on infrastructure, skills and research projects. The Washington-based lender of last resort said international competition usually encourages firms to boost their efficiency and invest more, while immigration helps to provide them with employees with the skills they need \u2013 but that changes arising from Brexit could hurt the economy. The fund said it assumes a 40% fall in exports of financial services to the EU as a consequence of the UK leaving the single market, while manufacturing firms that rely on foreign suppliers, such as carmakers, could be hit if trade with EU partners becomes more expensive or complicated by new rules. It also said British firms have been less willing to invest than would have been expected given the current upswing in global economic growth because they are waiting for details about the future relationship between the UK and the EU.",

A high court judge said the activist group Avaaz would have its case for a judicial review of Ofcom\u2019s decision heard before 30 June. \u201cThe case is arguable and may raise some important points of principle,\u201d said Justice Morris. \u201cPermission is hereby granted.\u201d Avaaz has argued that Ofcom\u2019s process and decision was flawed in a number of ways, including that it was too easy for subjects of fit and proper tests to be cleared. It also claimed the regulator had made errors when assessing 21st Century Fox\u2019s compliance with the UK broadcasting code, drew \u201cwrong conclusions\u201d from allegations of sexual and racial harassment at Fox News, and ignored the role Murdoch\u2019s son, James, would play as chief executive of 21st Century Fox. The judge said it was not necessarney for the outcome of Avaaz\u2019s court case to be known before the UK competition regulator publishes its final verdict on whether to clear the \u00a311.7bn takeover of Sky in April. The deal is being scrutinised because it raises media plurality issues, as full ownership of Sky would give the Murdochs control of Sky News as well as the Sun and the Times. The Competition and Markets Authority is examining options regarding the future of Sky News, including whether the news channel needs to be sold, spun off or just made editorially separate from Sky in order to resolve the media plurality issue. If Avaaz were to win its case then Ofcom would be forced to reconsider its \u201cfit and proper\u201d decision, which could provide yet another hurdle for the Murdochs. An Ofcom spokesman said: \u201cWe will defend our \u2018fit and proper\u2019 assessment, which was independent, expert and based on the evidence.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The chief executive of housebuilder Persimmon has said he never wanted his \u00a3110m bonus and that he has decided to give a \u201csubstantial\u201d amount of the windfall away through a charitable trust. Jeff Fairburn declined to say how much he would donate or which charities would receive the money. He said the uncapped bonus scheme was drawn up before he became chief executive in 2013 and he regretted that his company\u2019s performance had been overshadowed by uproar over the payout. He said he decided some time ago to give some of his bonus away but that he had wanted to take an \u201cold-fashioned approach\u201d and keep the decision private. \u201cIt\u2019s now clear that this belief was misplaced and so I am making my plans public and recognise that I should have done so sooner. I am setting up a private charitable trust which I plan to use to benefit wider society over a sustained period of time by supporting, in a very meaningful way, my chosen charities. \u201cI would like to make it clear that I did not seek these levels of award nor do I consider it right to keep them entirely for myself. Once it became apparent that our outperformance would lead to a very significant award for me, I made plans to use a substantial proportion of the total to support the charities that are particularly important to me and my family.\u201d Fairburn\u2019s announcement follows mounting uproar over the record-breaking bonus plan, with Persimmon accused of benefiting from the taxpayer-backed help-to-buy scheme. There has been widespread criticism from corporate governance groups, politicians and the boss of rival housebuilder Redrow, Steve Morgan, who described Fairburn\u2019s bonus as \u201cvery, very wrong\u201d. Persimmon\u2019s chairman and senior independent director have quit the board over the scheme, set up in 2012, which will hand more than \u00a3500m to 140 senior staff. Fairburn has collected \u00a350m of shares and will qualify for another \u00a360m this year. Last month Fairburn said he and his team had worked hard to qualify for the bonuses, which are linked to Persimmon\u2019s share price.",
