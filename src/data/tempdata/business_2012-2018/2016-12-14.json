      "bodyText": "It is excellent that finally the treasurer has realised that there is good and bad debt, but he shouldn\u2019t stop there. Rather than just have us guessing how much good or bad debt there is, the budget papers should tell us. After years of railing against government debt, Scott Morrison has discovered that actually debt is not only good, but also necessary. In a speech to the Australasian finance and banking conference, Mr Morrison \u2013 after noting that a vast majority of Australia\u2019s debt is private \u2013 argued that \u201cit is patently obvious there are good uses of debt and there are bad uses of debt. Bad debt is debt use for recurrent spending purposes\u201d. Wow, who knew?! It\u2019s amazing what happens when suddenly you are the one responsible for debt that continues to grow. But, here\u2019s a quiz. Look at the following graph and work out which is the good debt and which is the bad debt: Now if one were cynical you could argue that Scott Morrison has discovered that debt turns good once the LNP is in charge and especially when he is treasurer and all the bad debt is any that can be blamed on the ALP. But it was good to hear Morrison suggest bad debt was that which was required for recurrent spending, because with luck it will put to end the idiotic debate, which resurfaced this week, about the GFC stimulus package \u2013 which essentially had nothing to do with recurrent spending. It would also be nice to believe that the thinking expressed in his speech will be a bit of a turning point for economic debate. Among the dumbest economic narratives of my lifetime has been the suggestion that a budget surplus is inherently good for the economy and that a deficit is thus bad. The corollary to this is that governed debt is thus always bad and must be reduced. We could hope that Scott Morrison has had this change of heart on debt because he has discovered the worth of fiscal stimulus and running a deficit, and the weakness of relying purely on low interest rates to get the economy moving. But it is more likely his overwhelming worry that the ratings agencies are about to downgrade Australia\u2019s credit rating from its current AAA rating, and that he will be blamed for it. His speech pointedly mentioned those agencies, and he attempted to defend the government\u2019s fiscal soundness. He noted for those \u201cparticularly in ratings agencies\u201d that both \u201cthe current account and the budget, Australia\u2019s position is stronger today than it was a year ago\u201d. He noted that Australia\u2019s current account deficit \u201chad narrowed to 2.7% of GDP, down from 4.5% in December of 2012\u201d. Now that is true as far as it goes, although picking December 2012 is a bit odd, and would appear to have more to do with it being a high point rather than any particular reference point of note: The problem for Morrison, despite his new found understanding that debt can have positive effect on economic growth, is that the budget is very poor at differentiating the \u201cgood\u201d debt from the bad. It all just gets lumped together \u2013 and so we only talk of the total level of debt (currently at $463.2bn \u2013 an 80% increase on the $257.4bn held in June 2013). It\u2019s actually rather difficult to split up the budget into recurrent spending \u2013 things like pensions, ongoing defence, health and education spending \u2013 and capital expenditure \u2013 spending on infrastructure like roads, rail and the NBN. One problem is such capital spending is not always \u201con budget\u201d. Spending on the NBN, for example, is mostly \u201coff-budget\u201d because it involves spending on an asset for which there is an expected return. In such cases the spending is not regarded as government expenditure because unlike money spent on pensions or buying a new submarine, the government expects to get some (or all, or more) of the spending returned via someone buying the asset or repayment of the loan. But there are impacts on the budget, and yesterday the parliamentary budget office released a report outlining the expected impacts out to 2026-27. The PBO noted the government has committed $29.5bn in equity funding to NBN Co, and also a further loan of $19.5bn to complete the rollout. That $49bn is not included in the budget deficit, but that does not mean there is not an impact on the budget. The PBO noted that because the NBN Co has accumulated losses (which are expected in the early years of the roll out) there has been a $7.2bn deterioration in the government\u2019s equity holdings. That amount is reflected in a decline in the government aggregate net worth, which is found \u201cin its balance sheet and the department of communications and the arts annual financial statements\u201d but crucially \u201cit is not separately identified in the budget papers\u201d. The NBN does however have an impact on the budget deficit mostly from the debt interest payments that the government has to pay (because it had to borrow that $49bn). The PBO estimates that the annual cost to the budget of the government\u2019s investment in the NBN is $580m in 2016-17, and that it is expected to rise to $2.1bn by 2026-27. The PBO notes, these costs \u201cwhile significantly impacting the budget bottom line, are not separately identified in the budget papers.\u201d It is only through such reports do voters or ratings agencies get a better picture of what the budget is made up of. But given his new found acknowledgment of good and bad debt, one thing the treasurer could do in Monday\u2019s mid-year fiscal and economic outlook, or in next year\u2019s budget, is to actually provide us with the split of all such debt and expenditure. That way we would have not only a clearer picture of the government\u2019s debt level but also better debate about the need to cut back on recurrent spending \u2013 whether it be welfare, health, education or defence spending. For now all sides operate within an environment where debt is essentially a black hole able to be labelled as good or bad depending on political whims. Our economic debate would be much better served if \u2013 as with annual government expenditure \u2013 we were able to break down what the government debt is for and what the annual debt repayments are paying off.",

    "webTitle": "Janet Yellen: US interest rate rise 'vote of confidence' in economy \u2013 as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "We\u2019ve waited a whole year for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates. And when the big day arrived, the shock result of last month\u2019s US presidential election rather overshadowed it. So what did we learn? 1) Fed chair Janet Yellen insisted that the US economy was in decent shape, as America\u2019s central bank delivered its first hike in borrowing costs since December 2015. She said: \u201cOur decision to raise rates should certainly be understood as a reflection of the confidence we have in the progress the economy has made and our judgment that that progress will continue. It is a vote of confidence in the economy.\u201d But this sunny view didn\u2019t last long, with Yellen admitting during the press conference that the Fed was operating under a \u2018cloud of uncertainty\u2019, until it knows more about what Donald Trump will do. 2) In the nicest way possible, Yellen indicated that the labour market was doing fine, thanks, without Trump\u2019s plan for a $1 trillion infrastructure plan. She said: There may be some additional slack in labor markets, but I would judge that the degree of slack has diminished. So I would say at this point that fiscal policy is not obviously needed to provide stimulus to help us get back to full employment. But nevertheless let me be careful that I am not trying to provide advice to the new administration or to Congress as to what is the appropriate stance for policy. There are many considerations that Congress needs to take account of and many bases for justifying changing fiscal policy.\u201d 3) Fed press conferences can be quite dry affairs, but Yellen\u2019s most stirring moment came as she defended recent regulations brought in since 2008. Asked about Trump\u2019s pledge to roll back these rules, Yellen reminded us that Dodd-Frank was introduced to avoid another \u201cdevastating financial crisis\u201d \u201cI would say it\u2019s very important not to roll back. There maybe some changes that could be made and we\u2019ve suggested a few, like eliminating the burden of compliance with the Volcker rule or incentive compensation regulations for smaller banks or modestly raising the threshold for banks that are subject to enhanced credential supervision. But I would urge that it\u2019s important to keep this in place.\u201d 4) Yellen found herself in Trump\u2019s crosshairs several times during the election campaign, but she\u2019s not planning on quitting the Fed earlier. Asked about her own future, the Fed chair indicated she was going nowhere until her first term expires in 2008: \u201cI do intend to serve out my four-year term. I haven\u2019t made any decision about the future. I recognize I might or might not be reappointed. It\u2019s a decision I don\u2019t have to make and don\u2019t have thoughts on at this time. As you said I recognize too thatI could stay on as a board member, and that\u2019s a decision for another day.\u201d 5) Markets react, despite Yellen\u2019s calming words. Janet Yellen took some pains to insist that the Fed hasn\u2019t radically changed its approach, even though it now expects an extra rate hike next year (three, not two). This is a very modest adjustment in the path of the fed funds rate, and involves changes by only some of the participants. But with shares down, and the dollar rallying, investors may have concluded that Trump\u2019s election win changes the monetary policy landscape. Here\u2019s a little more reaction: And that\u2019s all from us after a busy day on both sides of the Atlantic. We\u2019ll be back tomorrow for more Fed reaction, the Bank of England\u2019s final policy meeting of 2016, and possibly more bailout drama in Greece. Goodnight, and thanks for reading and commenting. GW You can take off the Dow 20,000 hats, folks. The US stock market has closed in the red, with the Dow Jones index shedding 0.6% to finish at 19,792, a drop of around 118 points. The wider S&amp;P 500 lost 0.8%, while the Nasdaq handed back 0.5%. That shows that the Fed was more hawkish than Wall Street expected, or wanted. Here\u2019s Wall Street correspondent Rupert Neate on today\u2019s developments: The US Federal Reserve on Wednesday raised interest rates for the first time in a year, and only the second time since the 2008 financial crisis. The US central bank also predicted three further rates increase in 2017, up from previous expectations of two rate hikes. Janet Yellen, the Fed chairwoman, said \u201cgrowth is a touch stronger, unemployment is a shade lower\u201d as she announced a 0.25% increase in the benchmark rate to 0.50-0.75%. It is the first time rates have been raised since December 2015 when the benchmark rate was lifted from near-zero for seven years since the crisis. \u201cMy colleagues and I are recognizing the considerable progress the economy has made towards our dual objectives of maximum employment and price stability,\u201d Yellen said. \u201cWe expect that the economy will continue to perform well, with the job market strengthening further, and inflation rising to 2% over the next couple of years.\u201d More here: Capital Economics are even more bullish than the Fed, and expects FOUR interest rate rises next year. That\u2019s partly due to Donald Trump\u2019s plans for a fiscal stimulus package (even though Yellen argues that the labour market doesn\u2019t need the extra help). Capital Economics analysts say: As universally expected, the Fed today raised interest rates for the second time in this economic cycle, with that hike coming a full year after the first increase and more than seven years after the current expansion began. With the economy much closer to full employment now and a strong likelihood of a fiscal stimulus next year, however, we expect the Fed to accelerate the pace of tightening next year, with one rate hike in the first half of next year followed by three in the second half. Dean Turner, Economist at UBS Wealth Management, says we shouldn\u2019t underestimate the importance of today\u2019s rate hike: \u201cWhile this was universally expected, we shouldn\u2019t forget that this is still a big milestone. It marks only the second interest rate increase in a decade from the Fed. The Fed\u2019s anticipation of a faster pace of hikes (three next year vs two previously) and the nudge up in the long-run rate forecast to 3% shows that confidence in the growth outlook is increasing\u201d Investors are also dumping US government debt, sending the interest rate (or yield) on Treasury bills higher. Yields rise when prices fall, so traders are concluding that the Fed was more hawkish about monetary policy than expected (because it now expects three rate rises next year, up from 2 in September) I\u201dll post a snap summary of Yellen\u2019s press conference next. In the meantime, shares have fallen on Wall Street over the last 90 minutes as investors digest the Fed\u2019s rate hike and guidance for 2017. All the main indices are in the red, which means anyone hoping to see the Dow Jones smash through 20,000 points today will be disappointed. The dollar continues to rally, though, as traders react to the Fed\u2019s forecast for three rate hikes in 2017. It\u2019s up one whole cent against the euro, which has dropped to $1.052. And finally, we get another question about the US election... Q: Many people are angry about the economy, even though the aggregate performance levels seem pretty good. So are you reevaluating how you see the economy? Yellen says she has long been worried about income inequality, wealth inequality, and the fact that many families haven\u2019t seen real wage gains. These are long-standing concerns. These are not new phenomenons, but the recession was very severe and probably exacerbated them. And the Fed chair insists that central bankers can\u2019t solve these problems -- this is one for politicians. Our policies can affect the overall levels of economic activity, the inflation rate, but policymakers must be alert to these issues, she adds. Yellen then singles out the unemployment level among black and African American workers is higher than the average, before ending the press conference and heading to the door. Q: virtually every economist expected a rate rise today - does the Fed need that level of certainty before taking the plunge? Yellen says this is \u201cnot a prerequisite\u201d. Q: You have been criticised by Donald Trump several times, so are you still planning to serve your full term, and would you like a second term? Yellen must have known this would come up; and, smiling politely, she says she would still like to serve her full term (it expires in 2018). She\u2019s not considered if she would like a second term, and if she would still serve on the Fed board otherwise. I recognise that I may or may not be reappointed as Fed chair, Yellen adds. Q: Did you discuss Donald Trump\u2019s economic plans at this week\u2019s meeting, and the effect that his victory has had on the financial markets? Yellen reveals that the FOMC did indeed talk about this. All the participants agreed there was considerable uncertainty about how economic policies will change, she says, adding: We are operating under a cloud of uncertainty at the moment.\u201d The next question is also about Donald Trump, and his pledge to scrap some financial regulation, such as the Volcker Rule (which stops banks making riskier bets with their own money). Yellen launches a strong defence of the measures taken in recent years, saying: We lived through a devastating financial crisis that took a huge impact on our economy. Most policymakers came away from that crisis thinking we must take steps to avoid a repeat, and \u201cI feel we have done that\u201d, she adds. Q: What do you think about Donald Trump\u2019s tweeting, and his attacks on individual companies? (such as Boeing and Lockheed Martin)? I\u2019m not about to offer the president-elect advice, says Yellen. But she\u2019s not rolling over either, saying \u201cI\u2019m a strong believer in the independence of the Fed\u201d. Q: Why is it riskier to run \u2018hot\u2019 fiscal policy to strengthen the economy and drag more people into the labour market, rather than relying on monetary policy? [Another question about Donald Trump\u2019s infrastructure spending ideas] Yellen insists that she has never favoured \u201crunning a high-pressure economy\u201d. Asked again about potential tax and spending changes, Janet Yellen says that there\u2019s no obvious need to change fiscal policy to get America back to full employment. But she insists that she is not trying to provide advice to the new administration, or to Congress. Some snap reaction to today\u2019s press conference. This is from Sky News\u2019s Ed Conway: Here\u2019s Meg Greene, economist at Manulife: And here\u2019s Neil Irwin of the New York Times: Q: What will today\u2019s rate hike, and three more rate rises in 2017, mean for US families? Yellen says today\u2019s interest rate rise reflects the Fed\u2019s confidence in the economic recovery. The economy has been remarkable resilient, she says, adding: It is a vote of confidence in the economy. Households and firms will see very modest changes from this decision, she says. Q: Would tax cuts boost the productivity of the US economy? And how would the Fed react to new policies that improve productivity growth, or didn\u2019t? Yellen says policies that boost education, improve the quality of capital, or encourage innovative new companies would all boost the productive potential of America\u2019s economy. Q: Do would you have to raise rates faster if we saw fiscal policies that do not improve productivity? Yellen won\u2019t speculate about potential policy changes. Onto questions: Q: Why is the Fed now expecting three interest rate rises, not two? Is it because of the economy, or because of Donald Trump? Fed chair Yellen says there is only a \u201cvery modest change\u201d in the forecasts, with only a couple of policymakers changing their view (by moving their dot on that chart I showed earlier) Looking ahead, Yellen expects that the US economy will only warrant \u201cgradual rate increases\u201d. And then she touches on politics, saying that: Changes in fiscal policy, or other policies, could potentially affect the economic outlook. That\u2019s a coded reference to Donald Trump\u2019s plans for an infrastructure spending boost once he takes office. Yellen rattles through the Fed\u2019s latest economic projections, before concluding that they are \u201cvery similar\u201d to September\u2019s ones. GDP growth is a touch stronger, unemployment is a shade lower, and inflation is unchanged, she declares. Over the past seven years, since the depths of the US recession, 15 million new jobs have been created, the Fed chair tells reporters. On inflation, Yellen reminds us that consumer prices rose by an annual rate of 1.5% in October, up more than one percentage point over the last year. And core inflation (excluding fuel and food) came in at 1.75%.. Janet Yellen begins by confirming that the Fed raised interest rates by a quarter point today, to 0.5%-0.75%. She says that 2.25 million net new jobs have been created in the last 12 months, the labour market has improved, and inflation has moved closer to the Fed\u2019s 2% target. We expect the economy will continue to perform well, she adds. Janet Yellen has just arrived at today\u2019s press conference, to explain why the Fed has raised interest rates today. Here\u2019s a live feed (I\u2019ve also added it to the top of this liveblog) Donald Trump\u2019s plans for an aggressive fiscal spending plan have forced the Fed to predict faster rate hikes next year. So argues Lee Ferridge of State Street Global Advisors: \u201cAs widely expected the FOMC delivered the second rate hike in this cycle, precisely 12 months after its first move. However, in a major surprise it increased its expectations for the likely rate path in 2017 to three hikes rather than the two forecast following its September update. It seems that in light of the forthcoming Trump fiscal stimulus plan and, signs of both rising price pressures and inflation expectations (helped by the recent OPEC decision to cut oil output) the Fed felt that it needs to adopt a more aggressive rate hiking path. Nancy Curtin, chief investment officer at Close Brothers Asset Management, says today\u2019s rate hike is a \u201cvote of confidence\u201d in the US economy. But she also cautions that the economic outlook is still \u2018finely balanced\u2019: Though unemployment is at a nine year low, wages and the participation rate have recently come in flat, which should give some reason for caution. The economy is not yet firing on all cylinders. This trend will likely be observed closely in the New Year, particularly if inflation continues to run below its 2% target, and we might expect Yellen to look for more sustainable labour market improvements before further rises. Ian Kernohan, Economist at Royal London Asset Management, expects the Fed to tread cautiously, until Donald Trump has made his tax and spending plans clearer. \u201cToday\u2019s Fed rate hike was long anticipated, so there was no surprise when it came. Attention will now turn to the outlook for monetary policy in 2017. We do expect a sizeable fiscal stimulus to be announced next year; however the size and shape of that package may not be visible for some time. \u201cAs a consequence, we expect the Fed to remain cautious on the pace of rate hikes, at least in the first half of next year. The post-election rise in the dollar and bond yields also adds weight to arguments for a cautious approach.\u201d Here\u2019s some snap reaction to the decision, starting with Michelle Jamrisko of Bloomberg who remembers how the Fed\u2019s forecasts were wrong last year: Here\u2019s the Fed\u2019s new dot plot - showing where its policymakers expect interest rates to be over the next few years: As you can see, a majority of policymakers expect three rate rises in 2017 (that\u2019s the widest collection of dots in the second column). There\u2019s more uncertainty about 2018 and 2019 (which is why the dots are more scattered). Note that one policymaker expects only one rate hike next year, and none in 2018 and 2019! (that\u2019s the lonely dot that lags behind the rest). The dollar has strengthened, after the Fed\u2019s \u2018dot plots\u2019 predicted three rate hikes in 2017. It has gained 0.6% against the euro, meaning \u20ac1 is now worth $1.056, down from $1.062. Shares moved wildly on Wall Street as the Fed decision hit the wires, but things quickly calmed down. The Dow Jones Industrial Average nearly hit 20,000 points, but is now up just 0.12% at 19,936. The Federal Reserve says it has raised borrowing costs because the US economy has continued to strengthen. In today\u2019s statement (online here), it explains: Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in November indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been expanding at a moderate pace since mid-year. Job gains have been solid in recent months and the unemployment rate has declined. The Fed is also confident that the recovery will continue, taking inflation back to its target: The Committee expects that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions will strengthen somewhat further. Inflation is expected to rise to 2 percent over the medium term as the transitory effects of past declines in energy and import prices dissipate and the labor market strengthens further. Near-term risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced, it adds. IMPORTANT: The Federal Reserve is also predicting that it will raise interest rates three times in 2017. That\u2019s up from the two rate hikes expected back in September. BREAKING: The US Federal Reserve has voted to raise American interest rates for the first time this year, and only the second time in a decade. Borrowing costs are going up by a quarter-point, to 0.5%-0.75%. That\u2019s what Wall Street expected, and shows that the Fed is confident that the labour market is in solid shape. More to follow.... Just 15 minutes to go, until we get the most eagerly anticipated Fed decision of the year. Michael Scanlon, managing director of Manulife Asset Management, agrees that the Fed\u2019s guidance on interest rate policy will be crucial today. He says (via Reuters): The most important thing that investors will be looking atis the interpretation of the commentary from the Fed. I think the market is pricing in about two hikes for 2017 but if the Trump administration is able to reduce corporate taxes, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see four hikes next year.\u201d Colin Cieszynski of CNC Markets predicts that the Fed will be cautious about future rate hikes: The big question on everyone\u2019s lips is whether Donald Trump can resist the temptation to tweet about the Fed decision. Currency expert Kathleen Brooks, of City Index, says we must watch Trump\u2019s twitter activity after the Fed meeting: If Janet Yellen threatens to take away the punch bowl at his growth party could he throw his toys out of the pram, and tweet his displeasure? If he does, then this could cause major volatility in financial markets, and it could also be bad news for stocks, as it is likely to lead to questions about the Fed\u2019s independence from Presidential meddling in the coming years... On the other hand, if Trump can keep himself away from his Twitter account this evening then this would send a positive message to the markets that he will respect the Fed\u2019s independence going forward, which could be seen as positive for markets. It\u2019s possible that Yellen could upset the president-elect during her press conference, if journalist ask her about bank reglation. Brooks explains: One area where Yellen and Trump could clash is the Volcker Rule. This is one of the most controversial elements of Dodd-Frank regulation, which essentially bans banks from proprietary trading, and Donald Trump hates it. So if Yellen suggests she might oppose Trump\u2019s plans to loosen bank regulation, there could be fireworks.... Bloomberg\u2019s Carl Riccadonna reckons the Federal Reserve will deliver an \u201cambivalent hike\u201d today. A what?! He means they will raise borrowing costs by a quarter-point, but avoid making any firm comments on what Donald Trump\u2019s election win means for the economy. Tension in building on Wall Street as investors brace for the Fed decision. The Dow Jones industrial average is bobbing around last night\u2019s record close, at 19,910 points. The Dow has never been over 20,000 points, but today could be the day....if Janet Yellen reassures the markets. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at City firm IG, says the Fed chair\u2019s comments today will be crucial: With markets seeing a rate rise as a foregone conclusion, there will be a significant focus upon the language and Fed projections which should shed further light on the 2017 plan. America\u2019s central bank is preparing to announce its final monetary policy decision of 2016 at 2pm EST (7pm UK time, or 8pm in most of Europe). Investors and economists are united in predicting that the Federal Reserve will raise US interest rates, probably by a quarter-point to 0.5%-0.75%. This would be the first rate rise for a year, and mean that the Fed thinks America\u2019s economy, and labour market, is strong enough to handle higher borrowing costs. The Fed should also release its latest economic and financial forecasts at the same time; showing how its rate-setting committee sees the future. Fed chair Janet Yellen will then explain the Fed\u2019s decision at 2.30pm EST. We\u2019ll liveblog that press conference here. Anyone hoping that the US central bank will also offer insights on president-elect Trump will probably be disappointed. Yellen is likely to stick strictly to the numbers, rather than speculate on what Trump\u2019s economic plans might mean for monetary policy. As Jim Caron, fixed income portfolio manager at Morgan Stanley Investment Management, put it (via CNBC) \u201cI think too much is unknown. They\u2019re not going to involve themselves in that. They\u2019re going to do what they can do based on the economic evidence at hand.\u201d Dial back a year, and Fed policymakers were predicting four rate hikes in 2016. Instead, a series of shocks - including Britain\u2019s Brexit vote - have encouraged them to sit tight. So US interest rates have been pegged at 0.25-0.5% for 12 months. But it will be an almighty shock if the Fed doesn\u2019t hike today.... The chances of snap elections in Greece next year have risen, says Wolfango Piccoli of Teneo Intelligence. He says the eurogroup\u2019s decision to suspend Greek debt relief puts prime minister Alexis Tsipras in a very difficult position. If Tsipras goes ahead with the one-off payment to pensioners, this would further antagonize the EZ creditors, putting at risk the promised short-term debt relief. On the other side, giving in to the creditors\u2019 pressure would make Tsipras look amateurish at best, and at worst, further undermine his credibility and standing domestically. This would come on the back of a significant drop in popularity of his own SYRIZA. This new spat between Greece and its Eurozone partners means that the conclusion of the second review will be further delayed. It also increases the chances of snap elections in Greece as after overplaying his hand and facing increasing difficulties in concluding the review, Tsipras may be tempted to cut his losses by calling early elections before SYRIZA loses more support for adopting unpopular measures. Syriza would probably lose an early election, given the right-wing New Democracy party has a significant lead in the polls. Back with Greece: Markets paused for breath as investors awaited the Federal Reserve interest rate decision in less than two hours. An increase for the first time in a year is widely expected, but there will be more focus on what the Fed outlines in terms of future rises, not to mention any comments on the economy and the policies of president-elect Donald Trump. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 19.38 points or 0.28% at 6949.19 Germany\u2019s Dax dipped 0.35% to 11,244.84 France\u2019s Cac closed down 0.72% at 4769.24 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 1.18% to 18,606.32 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 1.21% to 9218.4 In Greece, the Athens market lost 3.21% to 619.19 as the country\u2019s lenders put debt relief on hold On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 18 points or 0.09%. Perhaps the news that Greece\u2019s lenders are putting debt relief on hold has not reached prime minister Alexis Tsipras. Or perhaps it has. In any case he has now announced his government will extend a pilot programme to give 30,000 school children free meals come January, which may well add to the annoyance shown already by creditors over his plans for Christmas bonuses for pensioners. Helena Smith reports: After announcing a one-off bonus for pensioners and suspension of a special sales tax on far flung Aegean isles, the leftist leader today turned to school children saying his government would ease the plight of those living in poverty-stricken areas of northern Greece. A pilot programme will, as of January, be funded from the government surplus to feed 30,000 school children living in those parts of Thessaloniki hardest hit by unemployment, he said. \u201cThis programme has been factored into the budget of 2017. It is worth around \u20ac11.5m,\u201d he said adding that wherever it had been enforced it had ameliorated the problem of malnourishment among young children and improved their performance at school. Asked if the hand-outs would derail the adjustment programme Greece has agreed to enforce, Tsipras appeared in especially defiant mood. \u201cI think everyone has to respect the Greek people, who for the last seven years, have made huge sacrifices in the name of Europe. We have carried the weight of the refugee crisis. In the name of Europe we have, in recent years, implemented an extremely harsh policy of austerity. There has to be respect from all. I have, if you will, no doubt whatsoever because everything that we are doing is absolutely within the framework of the Accord which we are keeping and which our partners should keep too.\u201d Oil prices have recovered from the day\u2019s lows after the latest US inventory figures showed a bigger than expected dip in crude stocks. In contrast with the American Petroleum Institute\u2019s figures on Tuesday, the Energy Information Administration said crude stocks fell by 2.6m barrels last week, compared with expectations of a 1.6m fall. But stocks at the Cushing, Oklahoma, delivery hub rise by 1.2m barrels. David Morrison, senior market strategist at Spread Co, said: This data was at odds with yesterday\u2019s API update. This showed an increase in crude inventories of 4.7 million barrels for the week ending 9th December. This was way above the consensus expectation which was for a decline of 1.6 million barrels. In addition, gasoline inventories showed their biggest rise since January. Crude has also been under pressure after OPEC released a report predicting that, despite promised production cuts, the oil market wouldn\u2019t rebalance until the second half of 2017. Earlier in the week the International Energy Agency (IEA) had forecast that supply and demand would be in balance in the first half of next year. Traders will be keeping a close eye on the WTI contract to see if it can hold above the $52 level. If it can\u2019t, then technically the stage could be set for a significant pull-back. Brent crude is currently down 0.5% at $55.43 a barrel having fallen as low as $54.76 during the day. West Texas Intermediate - the US benchmark - is down 0.98% at $52.46 a barrel. Back with Greece: Some more positive news from the eurozone. Italian prime minister Paolo Gentiloni won a confidence vote in the upper house of the Senate, allowing his coalition government to take office. Gentiloni replaced Matteo Renzi, who resigned last week after he lost a referendum on constitutional reform. The Greek stock market is down 2.9% following the news that lenders have put short term debt relief for the country on hold. Here\u2019s Reuters on the latest Greek debt developments: Euro zone lenders have put on hold the implementation of a short-term debt relief deal for Greece on Wednesday after the Greek government proposed to make a one-off payout to pensioners in December, the euro zone bailout fund ESM said. Euro zone finance ministers agreed on Dec 5 to grant Greece short-term debt relief that would reduce the amount of the country\u2019s public debt by 20 percentage points of GDP by 2060. But on Dec 8, Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras said, without consulting euro zone lenders, that his government would spend 617 million euros in one-off benefits for low-income pensioners ahead of Christmas because Greece exceeded its 2016 primary surplus target. \u201cFollowing recent proposals by the Greek government to spend additional fiscal resources for pensions and VAT our governing bodies have put their decisions temporarily on hold,\u201d a spokesman for the ESM said. \u201cInstitutions are currently assessing the impact of Greek government decisions vis a vis the ESM programme commitments and targets. (We) will then analyze the institutions\u2019 assessment and subsequently decide how to proceed,\u201d he said. And it seems that Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras\u2019 plan to give struggling pensioners a Christmas bonus has riled the country\u2019s creditors, who had not agreed the deal. The spokesman for the Eurogroup has just said there was no agreement now to implement the latest short term debt measures: Over to Greece where tensions between Athens and the International Monetary Fund continue. As prime minister Alexis Tsipras prepares to meet his French and German counterparts later this week, speculation is mounting that he will ask the organisation to withdraw from the country\u2019s current bailout program. Helena Smith reports from the Greek capital: Greece\u2019s relations with the IMF were never easy. The Washington-based institution has long been blamed fore the gruelling austerity visited on Greeks even when it wholeheartedly endorsed the cause of debt relief. But the latest spat may be a spat too far. Sources close to the Greek prime minister say in the wake of the fund\u2019s decision to go public with its views \u2013 in a blog penned this week by IMF European director Poul Thomsen and chief economist Maruice Obstfeld \u2013 Tsipras will propose that the organisation abstains altogether from the bailout programme currently keeping the country afloat. \u201cThe Fund has never officially joined this programme and we don\u2019t really need it,\u201d said one. \u201cAt most it could be reduced to a technical, consultative role.\u201d The leftist leader, who on Tuesday blasted the body for being staffed by \u201cirrational technocrats,\u201d is said to be incensed that it is now asking for more pension and tax cuts once the programme expires in 2018. Far too often, he said, the IMF had got it wrong with assessments that either over-estimated or under-estimated the impact of recessionary policies on Greece. In the blog, Thomsen and Obstfeld sought to clarify what they described as \u201cmisinformation\u201d surrounding the Fund\u2019s role in Greece insisting that far from advocating more austerity the organisation wanted less. Instead, they said, it was the agreement of Athens to achieve higher fiscal targets that made more austerity inevitable. Tsipras\u2019 new stance has not been met with universal applause. Many see it as counter-productive, arguing that despite popular myth the IMF is by far Greece\u2019s best ally supporting it on the need for debt relief and primary surplus requirements to be reduced. Wolfgang Manchau, the prominent European affairs columnist, tweeted that Tsipras was making a huge strategic mistake aligning himself with the Europeans against the IMF. Stefanos Manos, Greece\u2019s former finance minister, also said he welcomed the IMF officials\u2019 intervention. \u201cI\u2019m glad they went public with their views. Their [blog] comments amounted to a very balanced presentation and made quite a lot of sense,\u201d he told me. \u201cSome of their points \u2013 like the one that more than 50 % of people in Greece are not taxed at all - were hair-raising, absolutely maddening to read but needed to be aired.\u201d Ahead of the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate decision, US markets have edged lower. The Dow Jones Industrial Average - which has been toying with the 20,000 barrier for the first time - is down 11 points at 19,900 while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite are also marginally lower. All three indices hit new peaks on Tuesday. Oil prices have slipped lower after their surge since the weekend\u2019s agreement between Opec and non-Opec producers to cut output. The fall follows data from the American Petroleum Institute on Tuesday showing a 4.7m weekly rise in US crude inventories compared to expectations of a 1.6m decline. Official figures from the US Energy Information Administration are due later. Meanwhile Opec\u2019s latest report showed a growing oil surplus next year unless members stick to their output curbs. Opec said with the cuts the 2017 overhang would reach 1.24m barrels a day, up 300,000 on its previous estimate. Brent crude is currently down 1.29% at $55 a barrel. Something for the Federal Reserve to think about as they sign off on their latest interest rate decision, with the first rise for a year widely expected. Retails sales growth cooled off in November after two months of strong gains. They edged up just 0.1% as consumers cut back on car purchases, while October\u2019s figure was revised down from the initial 0.8% gain to 0.6%. Economists had been expecting a rise of 0.3%. Paul Sirani, chief market analyst at Xtrade, said: Retailers will be more than a little disappointed with November\u2019s drop in retail sales, as well as October\u2019s revised figure, which overall leaves question marks hanging over the sector going in to the festive shopping season. However, observers will point to the contentious presidential election as a prime reason for shoppers keeping their wallets closed amid the swirling uncertainty. With retailers making the bulk of their profits in December, the sector will be hoping the lure of sales will be too tempting for shoppers to resist. But signs of rising inflation have come from another set of data. US producer prices climbed 0.4% last month, the largest gain since June, after being unchanged in October. This is higher than the 0.1% increase expected by analysts. Economist Rob Carnell at ING Bank said: ..What really grabs the attention is the 1.3% month on month rise in trade services. This is mainly due to wider margins in the wholesale and retail sector. And as such, could well be echoed in the November CPI release on December 15. With the consensus expectation for only a 0.2% month on month increase in November\u2019s headline CPI, we now think that the risk of a higher (say 0.4% month on month) figure is looking more likely. If so, then headline inflation will rise from 1.6% in October, to 1.9% in November - in excess of the 1.7% year on year consensus estimate. With markets looking for little further tightening from the Fed after what looks a near-certain rate hike today - the Fed may start to look as if it is either allowing the economy to run a little hot, or alternatively, falling behind the curve, unless today\u2019s expected hike is coupled with more hawkish guidance. Labour market expert Paul Bivand has tweeted some useful charts on today\u2019s UK unemployment report, which show how the labour market appears to be cooling: With the UK employment figures out of the way, investors are waiting patiently for the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rates decision in six hours time. European stock markets are basically flat (the FTSE 100 has lost 7 points, or 0.1%), and Wall Street is expected to open quietly in 75 minutes time. Back in the City, shares in British\u2019s second largest pub chain have soared by a third as a takeover battle breaks out. Punch Tavern is being pursued by Heineken, the Dutch brewer which produces Strongbow and Foster\u2019s, and also by Alan McIntosh, one of Punch\u2019s cofounders. This two-way battle, broken by Sky\u2019s Mark Kleinman this morning, has excited the City. Shares in Punch have rocketed by 35% to 172p, from 128p, a two-year high. The company leases urban and rural pubs across the country to tenant landlords, and has been spending years tackling its huge debt pile build up before the financial crisis. Punch has just issued a statement, confirming that it is in \u201cadvanced discussions\u201d with the Heineken side, Patron Capital Advisers ,about an offer of 174p per share. It is also in \u201cdiscussions\u201d with McIntosh\u2019s consortium, Emerald Investment Partners, which are offering 185p per share (subject to due diligence etc). Punch cautions that: There can be no certainty that any firm offer will be made by either Patron or Emerald. A further announcement will be made in due course. Both groups have until 11 January to make a firm bid, or walk away. That might not be the end of it, though -- industry regulators might have concerns about such a large pub estate changing hands, especially as Heineken already owns 1,100 leased pubs. The Resolution Foundation have helpfully fired some charts over., showing how real wage growth is still below its pre-crisis levels (pay rises minus inflation). They also warn that inflation could overtake pay rises in 2017, hitting workers with another pay squeeze: Today\u2019s report shows that there are now 4.75 million self-employed people in the UK, up 129,000 compared to last year. Mike Cherry, National Chairman at the Federation of Small Businesses, is urging the government to provide more help for these workers - who aren\u2019t entitled to the full range of benefits which employees receive. \u201cThe huge rise in self-employment since the recession must be met with action. There is much to do to improve our social security and financial systems in particular. \u201cSocial security and our tax system have not kept up with the changing nature of 21st century work. It is urgent that Government gets to grips with the new reality of more people striking out on their own and working for themselves. In maternity, low pay, pensions and the housing market, the self-employed lose out from systems designed for a different age. \u201cThe Government\u2019s Taylor review is a crucial opportunity to help the wellbeing of the self-employed and the companies they start. Maternity support must be raised to a level closer with the employed and the design of Universal Credit changed so it\u2019s no longer a threat to business start-ups. The financial system must ensure the self-employed have the same chance to buy their own homes and save for retirement as those in traditional employment.\u201d Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), predicts that the unemployment rate will rise from its 11-year lows next year: \u201cThe labour market remains a source of strength for the UK economy. The number of people in work remains close to historically high levels, with unemployment levels continuing to fall. \u201cHowever, there are signs that the UK labour market may be beginning to cool, with a small fall in employment and the continued rise in the claimant count measure. \u201cIt is likely that UK unemployment will start to drift upwards in the coming months, as uncertainty over Brexit and the increasing input costs faced by businesses weigh on jobs growth. However, while we currently forecast the unemployment rate will peak at 5.5% in early 2018, this is still well below the long-term average. Dr John Philpott, Director of The Jobs Economist, is also concerned that the labour market is cooling down: \u201cThe UK labour market finally appears to be suffering a bout of post-Brexit vote blues which is now hitting recruitment. The number of people employed in the private sector has fallen by 17,000 and vacancies have levelled off, though an offsetting rise of 12,000 in public sector employment (mostly in education and the NHS) has limited the fall in both the overall job total and the employment rate. Despite this headline unemployment is down 16,000 on the quarter but only because the jobs slowdown is disguised by a sharp rise of 76,000 in the number of people out of work who are economically inactive. John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC, says today\u2019s Britain\u2019s labour market is cooling after a solid run: \u201cToday\u2019s data provides the clearest evidence yet that the jobs market has started to cool off since the Brexit vote. Total employment in the three months to October was broadly flat compared to the previous three months, having been rising strongly in the year before the EU referendum. \u201cThe official unemployment rate held steady at 4.8%, but this disguised a marked rise in economic inactivity of over 100,000 in the latest three months. The more timely but less comprehensive claimant count measure of unemployment edged up again in November for the fourth month in a row. Hawksworth adds that it will be hard for firms to hand out pay rises and take on more staff: Regular pay growth edged up to 2.6%, and is now close to 3% on average in the private sector. This is good news for workers facing the prospect of rising consumer price inflation over the next year, but could dampen future jobs growth if it continues.\u201d Professor Geraint Johnes, director of research at Lancaster University\u2019s Work Foundation, has dug into today\u2019s data and found that more self-employed workers are now only working part time hours. That may be a sign that some firms are suffering a drop in demand. He says: \u201cThe number of full-time self-employed workers fell by some 55000 while those of part-time self-employed workers rose by 53000. The nature of many jobs undertaken by self-employed workers is precarious, and it is not at this stage clear to what extent the shift towards part-time work is voluntary. To the extent that it is not, there may be clouds on the horizon.\u201d The rise in wage growth, from 2.4% to 2.6%, will unfortunately be eroded by inflation - which jumped from 0.9% to 1.2% in November. TUC General Secretary Frances O\u2019Grady urges the government to help workers, particularly in the public sector. \u201cWages are still struggling to get off the ground with increases in pay offset by rising inflation. After the longest wage squeeze since Victorian times, this isn\u2019t the pay boost working people need to get their living standards back on track. \u201cThe government needs to act fast to avoid another living standards crisis. That means a clear plan for Brexit that will protect jobs, pay and rights. And we need a quick end to the unfair public sector pay cap, which will see public sector workers face year-on-year cuts to real pay.\u201d Today\u2019s labour market report also suggests that Britain became a little more productive in the last quarter. We worked a combined total of 1.01 billion hours in the August to October quarter, which is five million hours fewer than in May to July. The ONS says: people worked, on average, 31.9 hours per week, down slightly compared with May to July 2016 and with a year earlier people working full-time worked, on average, 37.3 hours per week in their main job, a decrease of 0.2 hours compared with May to July 2016 and down slightly compared with a year earlier people working part-time worked, on average, 16.1 hours per week in their main job, unchanged compared with May to July 2016 but down slightly compared with a year earlier. And as the economy grew by an estimated 0.4% in August-October, that means productivity has gone up (as we took less time to do more work. Economist Rupert Seggins flags up that the claimant count has been rising for several months - a sign that the UK labour market may be weakening. Here\u2019s the key points from today\u2019s labour market report: For August to October 2016, there were 31.76 million people in work in Britain -- 6,000 fewer than in May to July 2016 but 342,000 more than for a year earlier. The employment rate (the proportion of people aged from 16 to 64 who were in work) had fallen to 74.4%, from the joint record high of 74.5% recorded for May to July 2016, but higher than for a year earlier (73.9%). There are 1.62 million unemployed people, 16,000 fewer than for May to July 2016 and 103,000 fewer than for a year earlier. The unemployment rate remained at 4.8%, down from 5.2% for a year earlier. It has not been lower since July to September 2005. The number of economically inactive people (not in work or seeking work) jumped by 76,000 in the last quarter to 8.91m. Average weekly earnings rose by 2.5% including bonuses and by 2.6% excluding bonuses. There\u2019s good news for workers: Average weekly earnings excluding bonuses rose by 2.6% year-on-year in the three months to October, up from 2.4% last month. Pay including bonuses rose by 2.5%, up from 2.4%. Here\u2019s Bloomberg\u2019s snap take of the unemployment report: U.K. employment fell for the first time in more than a year in the three months through October as the labor market showed some signs of weakness. The number of people in work fell by 6,000 to 31.76 million people, the Office for National Statistics said on Wednesday. While the decline was small, and the jobless rate was unchanged at 4.8 percent, the statistics office said the labor market \u201cappears to have flattened off in recent months.\u201d Single-month data showed that the unemployment rate rose to 4.9 percent in October from 4.6 percent in September. Unemployment also fell over the three-month period, though that was offset by an increase in the inactivity rate. Breaking: Britain\u2019s jobless rate remains at an 11-year low of 4.8% for the three months to October. That matches last month\u2019s figures. But the number of people in work has dropped by 6,000 to 31.762m, the first fall since the second quarter of 2015. And the number of people claiming unemployment benefit has gone up again, by 2,400 in November, to 809,000. More to follow! Italian banking shares have hit their highest level since June, having gained 1.3% this morning. Traders haven\u2019t given up hope that the sector\u2019s weaker banks can be recapitalised, especially after Unicredit\u2019s \u20ac13bn cash call received a warm welcome yesterday. Italian bank shares have now jumped by a quarter since the referendum on constitutional reform, and the resignation of Matteo Renzi: Kit Juckes of Societe Generale predicts that the Federal Reserve will play a very straight bat today, when it (probably) raises US interest rates for the first time in 2016. A year ago, markets expected the Fed Funds rate to be in a 0.75-1% range by now. By this evening, they are likely to have crawled to 0.50-0.75%. If for no other reason, that should caution anyone expecting much in the way of a hawkish message from the FOMC - this is a Fed leadership group whose main feature is its dovishness. Given that the single biggest source of economic uncertainty hanging over the US economy right now is the outlook for fiscal policy -what will President Trump do? - the temptation to be very, very bland in the statement that accompanies a thoroughly-discounted rate hike at 7pm GMT, is likely to be irresistible. There\u2019s no drama in the foreign exchange markets either, where the pound is sticking firmly to $1.267 against the US dollar, up just 0.1% Traders may be reluctant to take big positions ahead of today\u2019s Federal Reserve meeting, which could spark volatility depending how hawkish or dovish Janet Yellen is. Europe\u2019s stock markets have opened cautiously, as investors sit tight ahead of today\u2019s UK unemployment report, and the Fed meeting tonight. London\u2019s FTSE 100 has dipped by 16 points, or 0.25%, and there are similar declines in France and Germany. Dixons Carphone are the biggest faller, down 3% in volatile trading, despite posting a 14% jump in profits and telling the City it had its \u2018biggest ever\u2019 Black Friday. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets agrees that today\u2019s earnings figures are particularly important, following the rise in inflation from 0.9% to 1.2% yesterday. Inflation certainly appears to be on the way back in the UK in numbers released yesterday, which showed that CPI hit its highest levels in two years driven primarily by clothing and fuel prices, while a rise in import prices to their highest levels since 2011 was an unwelcome portend of what could be around the corner in 2017. Unemployment is expected to remain at 4.8%, while average earnings are expected to remain at 2.3%. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. This morning\u2019s main event is the latest UK unemployment report at 9.30am GMT, which will show whether Britain\u2019s labour market is ending the year with a bang or a whimper. The figures will be poured over for signs that the economy is weakening in the face of continued Brexit uncertainty. Economists predict that the headline jobless rate will stay low, but the number of people signing on for unemployment benefit may rise. Here\u2019s what the City expects: the unemployment rate will remain at an 11-year low of 4.8% in the three months to October The employment total will rise by 50,000 during the quarter. Wage growth will remain at 2.3% (but may accelerate to 2.5% if bonuses are stripped out). The claimant count will jump by 6,500 in November, following last month\u2019s 9,800 rise. Yesterday we saw inflation jump to 1.2%, so if wages don\u2019t rise too people will face a real earnings squeeze in 2017. Analysts at RBC Capital Markets believe the jobless rate could rise a little, to 4.9%, but are cautious about jumping to many Brexit conclusions. Employment growth momentum is fading but it is still early days as far as capturing the referendum effect is concerned. Also coming up today. The US Federal Reserve is widely expected to raise American interest rates today, at its final FOMC meeting of the year (at 7pm GMT or 2pm EST). Fed chair Janet Yellen will then give a press conference, to discuss the state of the US economy - and probably field a few questions about politics too. We\u2019ll keep an eye on Greece, where relations between Athens, the IMF and the EU are deteriorating in a familiar fashion: On the corporate front, consumer electronics group Dixons Carphone are reporting results this morning. They look decent, at first glance, with first-half profits up 19%, but the firm is also talking about uncertain times ahead. They\u2019re holding a press with journalists right now, so we\u2019ll have more shortly...",

The Washington-based institution has long been blamed fore the gruelling austerity visited on Greeks even when it wholeheartedly endorsed the cause of debt relief. But the latest spat may be a spat too far. Sources close to the Greek prime minister say in the wake of the fund\u2019s decision to go public with its views \u2013 in a blog penned this week by IMF European director Poul Thomsen and chief economist Maruice Obstfeld \u2013 Tsipras will propose that the organisation abstains altogether from the bailout programme currently keeping the country afloat. \u201cThe Fund has never officially joined this programme and we don\u2019t really need it,\u201d said one. \u201cAt most it could be reduced to a technical, consultative role.\u201d </p> <p>The leftist leader, who on Tuesday blasted the body for being staffed by \u201cirrational technocrats,\u201d is said to be incensed that it is now asking for more pension and tax cuts once the programme expires in 2018.

      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s a safe prediction for 2017: the Greek debt crisis will turn ugly again. In fact, the next chapter has already begun. On Wednesday, eurozone finance ministers put their plan for short-term debt relief on hold because Athens handed a relatively small sum of money to pensioners at Christmas and said it would pay for school meals for 30,000 children in impoverished areas. In the view of Alexis Tsipras, Greek prime minister, the country has earned the right to make small acts of generosity, like \u20ac617m (\u00a3518m) for pensioners. Greece didn\u2019t just meet its target to run a budget surplus of 1.5% last year, it exceeded it. That achievement was secured after seven years of austerity, a period in which Greece also found itself at the front end of Europe\u2019s migration crisis. In the eyes of the eurozone ministers, however, rules are rules. Tsipras\u2019s measures \u201cappear not to be in line with our agreements\u201d and thus debt relief will be suspended. The message to Tsipras was plain: perform a U-turn, however politically embarrassing. It is possible that the immediate tension could be defused, but it is hard to be optimistic about next year. The demands on the budget get stiffer from here \u2013 a surplus of 3.5%, rather than 1.5%, is required by 2018. The International Monetary Fund regards that target as too stiff, but its argument for greater leniency comes with strings attached. It wants Greece to make sweeping structural reforms to its economy and labour laws to promote growth. But how, politically, is that supposed to happen in the face of the current high rates of unemployment and without an adequate system of welfare support? The position is a mess. Greece is at loggerheads with eurozone ministers, and the eurozone and the IMF are struggling to maintain a united front. Optimists might argue that bigger disagreements have been overcome in the past. The difference this time, however, is that the demand for a 3.5% budget surplus looks unachievable, which is the IMF\u2019s point. The body is right, but the eurozone\u2019s position is only hardening. Two would-be suitors prepare for Punch-up Roll up, roll up, there\u2019s a fresh brawl at Punch Taverns. This time the squabble is not between junior bondholders, senior bondholders, shareholders and various hedge funds. That re-financing saga \u2013 the delayed consequence of turning a pub company into a grotesque exercise in financial engineering in the early 2000s \u2013 was finally resolved 18 months ago at the fifth attempt. Now comes something conventional: a takeover battle. Nobody has made much money from owning Punch shares for the past decade but suddenly two parties are keen to buy a company that, even in shrunken form, still owns almost 3,300 pubs in the UK. Unfortunately, from the point of view of the great British drinker, neither potential new owner raises a cheer. The Heineken proposal may be anti-competitive in intent. The Dutch brewer already owns 1,100 leased pubs in the UK. A plan to take the larger portion of Punch \u2013 some 1,900 pubs \u2013 may just be an attempt to force more of its bland lager on to a semi-captive audience. No wonder its co-traveller on the offer, Patron Capital, is presented as the leader. The problem with the other contender, Emerald Investment, is that its chief, Alan McIntosh, was a founder of Punch back in the late 1990s. McIntosh has enjoyed success on many fronts over many years, but being a pioneer of the pubco model was not his finest hour. He might argue that he left Punch soon after flotation in 2002 and that the high-leverage formula only became dangerous when successors pushed it too hard. Maybe, but let\u2019s hear that argument in full; financial engineering definitely seemed to be present at the birth. Still, Stephen Billingham, Punch chairman for the past half decade, deserves credit for rescuing the company from its near-death experience, an outcome that was not guaranteed during the refinancing negotiations in 2012-14. He is probably obliged to back one of the proposals since the hedge funds who dominate the shareholder register may demand an exit. Besides, Punch\u2019s securitised debts are still 6.6 times its top-line earnings, so his negotiating hand is weak. But, strange as it sounds after Punch\u2019s horrible history, independence wouldn\u2019t be a bad outcome. On the trading front and in its relations with tenants, Punch has been showing definite signs of rehabilitation. Financial spreadbetting firm\u2019s move is outside bet Financial spreadbetting firms hate the Financial Conduct Authority\u2019s plan to make the industry a safer place for punters by clamping down on the leverage ratios that can be used on products such as contracts for difference. But would CMC Markets really re-locate to Germany? The idea, apparently, is under consideration. Don\u2019t put a penny on it happening. Some 350 of CMC\u2019s 575 staff work in London and only 20 in Germany. The upheaval would be immense. Besides, the FCA is not stupid and has ways to tackle regulatory arbitrage, for example banning firms from advertising. CMC, one strongly suspects, will stay put.",

Besides, the FCA is not stupid and has ways to tackle regulatory arbitrage, for example banning firms from advertising. CMC, one strongly suspects, will stay put.</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The US Federal Reserve on Wednesday raised interest rates for the first time in a year, and only the second time since the 2008 financial crisis. The US central bank also predicted three further rates increase in 2017, up from previous expectations of two rate hikes. Janet Yellen, the Fed chairwoman, said \u201cgrowth is a touch stronger, unemployment is a shade lower\u201d as she announced a 0.25% increase in the benchmark rate to 0.50-0.75%. It is the first time rates have been raised since December 2015 when the benchmark rate was lifted from near-zero for seven years since the crisis. \u201cMy colleagues and I are recognizing the considerable progress the economy has made towards our dual objectives of maximum employment and price stability,\u201d Yellen said. \u201cWe expect that the economy will continue to perform well, with the job market strengthening further, and inflation rising to 2% over the next couple of years.\u201d Yellen also set out a path of faster pace of rate increases next year than previously expected. The rate setting Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) said it expected to raise short-term rates by another 0.75% percentage points next year \u2013 probably in three separate quarter-point moves \u2013 up from a previously predicted 2017 increase of 0.5%. \u201cThe stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting some further strengthening in labor market conditions and a return to 2% inflation,\u201d the FOMC said in a statement. The unanimous decision to raise rates, the first time in months that the 10 members of FOMC had all agreed on policy, came at the end of the committee\u2019s first rate-setting meeting since the election of Donald Trump as America\u2019s next president. The statement made no mention of the effect of Trump\u2019s policies on the country\u2019s economic prospects. But experts have said Trump\u2019s plans for massive tax cuts and huge infrastructure investment could spur the economic recovery. US stock markets, which soared to record highs following Trump\u2019s victory, fell slightly following the decision, which had been widely expected by traders and economists. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was hovering at 19,954 points \u2013 a more than 9% increase since the 8 November election. Trump has repeatedly criticised Yellen for not raising interest rates fast enough, which he said had created a \u201cfalse economy\u201d and delayed the recovery, and called for her to be replaced. In September, he said Yellen \u201cshould be ashamed of herself\u201d. \u201cI used to hope that the Fed was independent,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the Fed is obviously not independent. It\u2019s obviously not even close to being independent.\u201d Trump had said he is unlikely to nominate Yellen to continue as Fed chief when her term expires in early 2018. Yellen has refused to leave before the end of her term. Rob Carnell, chief international economist at ING, said: \u201cThe big takeaway from this meeting was the increase in the pace of tightening signaled for 2017. Where two rate hikes of 25bp were signaled in the previous guidance, there are now three hikes signaled. \u201cDespite this, the other forecast variables are little changed. Probably most noteworthy is the small 0.1 percentage point increase in 2017 GDP growth, now expected to be 2.1%, but no further increase is expected in 2018, which is unchanged at 2.0%. The 2019 GDP forecast is also only slightly higher at 1.9% (1.8% previously). There is not much concession in these growth forecasts to expectations of big fiscal stimulus from a Trump administration and our own forecasts are considerably higher \u2013 closer to 3% in both years.\u201d Jeremy Cook, chief economist at international payments company World First, said: \u201cThe Federal Reserve found enough strength in the US economy to hike 25 basis points for the first time this year. This means basically nothing.\u201d \u201cWhat matters is that the expectations shown in the dot plot charts show a Federal Reserve that is supremely uncertain as to the path of US economy moves into 2017. They\u2019ve noted the strength in inflation and the jobs market but this is a central bank eager to know what kind of administration they will have to work with. Until then there was little chance of them basing policy on the pronouncements of someone who has a casual relationship with consistency.\u201d \u201cOur eyes now move back to the politics in the United States and the rebuttal of the Fed\u2019s decision from the president-elect via his Twitter account.\u201d Rates had been expected to be raised earlier this year, but the decision was delayed by concerns about a slowdown in the Chinese economy, Brexit and the unpredictable US presidential election. The Fed predicted economic growth reaching 1.9% this year, slightly above its forecast in September. However, it kept its long-term estimate for economic growth at 1.8%, far below the 4% pace that Trump promises to deliver via a program of deregulation, tax cuts and infrastructure spending. The committee expects little improvement in the unemployment rate from the current rate of 4.6%. The rate hike was widely expected with all 120 economists polled by Reuters expecting an interest rates increase.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "More than 2,000 British Airways cabin crew based at Heathrow could go on strike over Christmas after voting overwhelmingly in favour of walkouts in a dispute over pay. Cabin crew in BA\u2019s mixed fleet unit \u2013 who represent about 15% of stewards at the airline \u2013 voted to strike after rejecting a 2% pay offer on what the Unite union has described as \u201cpoverty pay\u201d levels. BA accused Unite of creating uncertainty for passengers over the festive season and said it would attempt to resolve the dispute without causing disruption. Union representatives will meet over the next two days to decide what action to take, with a strike possible at any date from 21 December. Unite balloted about 2,500 staff at Heathrow, with a 79% vote to strike on a 60% turnout. All of BA\u2019s new flight crew members are recruited into the mixed fleet branch, which was set up in 2010 on lower pay and conditions than existing crew. The mixed fleet group operates on long-haul and short-haul flights from Britain\u2019s biggest airport. Average pay, including allowances, is just \u00a316,000 a year for cabin crew, according to the union, although BA said crew would normally make at least \u00a321,000 a year with bonuses. Basic salary is \u00a312,000 a year \u2013 a figure that has led some to resort to moonlighting in other jobs or sleeping in their cars between shifts to survive, the union said. The mixed fleet considered a strike in 2014, with discontent stoked by the differential in pay between new recruits and company bosses. Willie Walsh, the chief executive of BA\u2019s parent company, IAG, earned \u00a36.5m in 2015. The airline group is forecasting annual profits of \u20ac2.5bn (\u00a32.3bn), largely driven by BA. Unite\u2019s regional officer Matt Smith said the BA cabin crew were \u201cat breaking point\u201d. He added: \u201cMixed fleet crew earn just over the minimum wage and below the national average. Significant numbers of crew are taking on second jobs, many go to work unfit to fly because they can\u2019t afford to be sick. British Airways bosses need to wake up to the anger and the injustice here.\u201d Smith said low pay was not just indefensible but a safety issue for aviation. \u201cInexperience, fatigue, and the fact that BA recently cut the length of crew training courses means Unite is genuinely concerned about the potential repercussions.\u201d BA said the airline had made an offer that would lead to basic pay and hourly duty rates increasing by a minimum of 7%. A spokesperson for the airline said: \u201cWe are extremely disappointed that the union is creating uncertainty for our customers. Mixed fleet Unite represents about 15% of our cabin crew. \u201cWe remain focused on resolving this issue as quickly as possible without any disruption to customers. We have proposed a fair and reasonable pay increase to mixed fleet cabin crew, which is in line with that accepted by other British Airways colleagues and which will ensure their reward levels remain in line with cabin crew at our airline competitors.\u201d Smith said: \u201cWe urge British Airways to avoid this dispute and do the right thing by both the frontline staff and the travelling public, by engaging with Unite to negotiate a genuinely meaningful way forward.\u201d The airline was the site of Britain\u2019s most prolonged and bitter strikes of recent years, when cabin crew walked out for 22 days between 2010 and 2011, a dispute that cost the airline about \u00a3150m. BA rival Virgin Atlantic may also see flights affected over Christmas and the New Year. The PPU, a new union that represents around 70% of Virgin\u2019s pilots, is seeking recognition within the company and has balloted members after the collapse of talks. Pilots have been asked to take industrial action short of a strike over the issue of union recognition. The ballot closes on Friday.",

The Danish firm confirmed it had decided to to hike the prices of its playsets, bricks and mini-figures in the UK owing to \u201ccurrency fluctuations\u201d, while not ruling out further increases if sterling does not recover. A letter shared on social media this week from a senior Lego executive to UK toy retailers revealed that prices would increase across the board from 1 January. Signed by Lego UK and Ireland\u2019s general manager and vice-president, Fiona Wright, it explained that the hike was a \u201cdirect result of the continued devaluing of the UK pound\u201d. The letter went on to warn that the company might be forced to put up prices again in the \u201cevent of further negative trend\u201d.

The company recently confirmed the appointment of a British chief executive and opened its biggest flagship store in Leicester Square, London. Since the EU vote in June, the pound has plummeted by about 16 % against the dollar and by 9% against the euro, forcing manufacturers to signal or introduce price rises. A string of major food brands have already sought increased prices from supermarkets as the fall in the pound has driven up the cost of importing ingredients and other essentials, such as packaging.

Unite, the union which is representing the drivers, said it had reached an agreement with Wincanton on Wednesday morning and hammered out a deal which it could recommend to its members. They would then vote on whether to accept the deal. Unite regional officer Rick Coyle said: \u201cWhile this ballot is being conducted, all proposed industrial action has been suspended and our members at the Argos national distribution centre in Staffordshire will be working normally.\u201d A spokesperson for Wincanton said: \u201cWe are equally pleased that our planned meeting today has produced an outcome which works for all parties. All industrial action has now been suspended pending a ballot on the terms of the agreement among Unite members, and at this important time of year, the Argos business will be unaffected.\u201d Meanwhile, the union representing Post Office workers has started three days of talks to avert strike action before Christmasat its 300 biggest branches. Post Office workers voted to stage five days of strikes from 19 December in a long-running dispute over jobs and pensions. The Communication Workers Union, which acts for about 4,000 postal workers, has said it wants to avoid strike action if possible. The Post Office said less than 3% of its outlets would be affected by the action. But the CWU said more than a fifth of parcels were handled by the 300 crown post offices where its members work. Royal Mail, which delivers parcels and letters and is privately owned after splitting from the Post Office several years ago, has said its operations would not be affected by the strike.",

    "webTitle": "UK employment falls in months after Brexit vote", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Employment in Britain has fallen for the first time in a year in a half in a sign that the UK jobs market is losing steam following the EU referendum. The employment rate edged lower to 74.4% in the three months to October, from a record high of 74.5%, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). It was the first drop since February to April 2015, triggered by a 6,000 fall in the number of people in work to 31.76 million. Meanwhile, the number of people claiming unemployment benefits rose by 2,400 in November to 809,000. \u201cThis is the first genuine disappointment we have seen in the hard data since the Brexit vote,\u201d said Alan Clarke, UK economist at Scotiabank. John Philpott, an employment expert and director of The Jobs Economist, said a rise in public sector jobs was not enough to offset a fall in private sector employment. \u201cThe UK labour market finally appears to be suffering a bout of post-Brexit vote blues, which is now hitting recruitment. The UK labour market looks to have entered a somewhat slower time,\u201d he said. The latest official report on Britain\u2019s jobs market was mixed, with unemployment down 16,000 over the three months to 1.62 million and the jobless rate unchanged at 4.8%. Average pay growth picked up more than expected to 2.6%, or 2.5% excluding bonuses, from 2.4%. But the number of people of working age considered \u201ceconomically inactive\u201d \u2013 out of work and neither seeking nor available to work \u2013 jumped by 76,000 over the period to 8.9 million. Damian Green, the work and pensions secretary, highlighted the fact that the jobless rate remained at the lowest in more than a decade. He added: \u201cThis year will be remembered as one when so many records were made \u2013 employment has consistently been running at an all-time high with more women, older workers and ethnic minority groups in work than ever before. \u201cBut there is more to do to help people of all backgrounds and abilities into work, which will remain a priority as we press ahead with our welfare reforms that are ensuring it always pays to be in work.\u201d But the ONS said its figures suggested the UK employment market was softening. David Freeman, a senior statistician, said: \u201cThe labour market appears to have flattened off in recent months. While the employment rate remains high, it is slightly down on the record set recently. Meanwhile, a small fall in unemployment on the quarter was more than offset by a rise in economic inactivity.\u201d Economists including those at the Bank of England have warned that 2017 would be tougher for UK workers and consumers. Unemployment is expected to rise as the broader economy slows and businesses grapple with higher costs and waning demand. Commenting on the latest ONS figures, Suren Thiru, the head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, said: \u201cIt is likely that UK unemployment will start to drift upwards in the coming months, as uncertainty over Brexit and the increasing input costs faced by businesses weigh on jobs growth. However, while we currently forecast the unemployment rate will peak at 5.5% in early 2018, this is still well below the long-term average.\u201d Higher inflation is expected to squeeze household finances at a time of weak wage growth. Inflation data published on Tuesday showed the headline annual rate rose to 1.2% in November from 0.9% in October. It was the highest level in more than two years, driven higher by clothing and petrol prices, in a sign that the fall in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote is fuelling a rise in the cost of living. Inflation is expected to rise sharply in 2017, to about 3%, further squeezing household finances. UK workers are only just recovering from a prolonged period of falling real pay during the financial crisis, when inflation was higher than wages growth for six straight years. Rachel Smith, the CBI\u2019s principal labour market adviser, said: \u201cWe see a mixed picture from the labour market over the last three months, with employment levels remaining more or less the same and unemployment seeing a slight drop. \u201cAlthough wage growth has gone up somewhat, so has inflation, hitting workers\u2019 pay packets in real terms. Boosting productivity in every region and nation of the UK will be essential if firms are to further raise wages sustainably for their employees.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Talks at Acas aimed at bringing an end to the long-running Southern rail dispute have adjourned for the day, leaving passengers facing the uncertain prospect of further chaos on Britain\u2019s biggest rail franchise. Southern\u2019s owner, Govia Thameslink Railway, began talks with the drivers\u2019 union, Aslef, on Wednesday morning, on the second day of a strike that had completely wiped out Southern\u2019s services. Sources close to the talks described them as positive but with no concrete progress, and no concessions offered by either sides in terms of calling off the strike or halting the driver-only operation of trains. Talks will resume at 10.30am on Thursday and are likely to last through the week. All of Southern\u2019s 2,242 weekday services, which normally carry more than 300,000 passengers, were cancelled again on Wednesday, the worst strike-led disruption since privatisation. If no resolution is found, an ongoing overtime ban will seriously disrupt services on Thursday, before drivers strike again on Friday. Conductors in the RMT union will walk out for two days from Monday. While talks will resume between GTR and Aslef on Thursday, relations between the train operator and the RMT union, representing conductors, have been further damaged after the RMT leader, Mick Cash, left Acas claiming to have been \u201cbarred\u201d from talks. Cash said GTR was fully aware on Tuesday night that he would be attending talks, but that he was told on arrival by the company that he would not be allowed to take part. \u201cRMT is furious at the complete contempt that has been shown to us by Southern rail this morning, which leaves us in a state of limbo when we should all be around the table thrashing out the issues that have led to the current action. \u201cOur members were expecting discussions to take place today and instead we have had the door slammed in our faces. That is no way to rebuild the confidence of the workforce in the Southern management and the talks process and it is no way to reach a solution, which is what the public are crying out for.\u201d But GTR said it still hoped to talk to Cash, although only Aslef had been invited by Acas to discuss the current strike by drivers. Nick Brown, GTR\u2019s chief operating officer, said: \u201cWe hope today\u2019s talks with the Aslef leadership are productive. I have spoken with the general secretary of the RMT this morning and informed him we\u2019d be happy to meet him at Acas later today to talk about any new proposals he has to try and end the conductors\u2019 dispute and I also asked him to call off their programme of strikes planned for Christmas and New Year.\u201d Little progress is believed to have been made on Wednesday in talks between GTR and Aslef, but the fact that neither side has yet left the negotiating table may be a positive sign. Previous talks had broken down swiftly as the company continued to insist on the flexibility to run trains without a second crew member in some circumstances \u2013 a red line for the unions who fear jobs will be lost or deskilled, as the company, and more broadly the government, pushes to introduce more driver-only-operated trains. The current talks take place after days of recriminations from both sides, with the train drivers\u2019 union Aslef accusing the government of blocking serious talks and manipulating the Southern dispute. The transport secretary, Chris Grayling, said the unions had embarked on an unnecessary political strike. Passengers on Southern and Gatwick Express have been warned to expect services to be severely disrupted on Thursday following the strike and an ongoing overtime ban. Southern passenger services director, Angie Doll, said: \u201cWe will be working hard to run as many services as possible tomorrow, but regrettably I have to warn passengers that services will be severely impacted, with reductions and cancellations across all routes. \u201cWith today\u2019s strike ending at midnight, despite our best efforts, some trains and crew will still not be in position for tomorrow\u2019s service; and the overtime ban will continue to have a serious impact.\u201d Southern advised passengers not to travel at all on Friday, when drivers will again be on strike. There will be no Southern services and Gatwick Express will run every half an hour. A commuter group is planning a protest march from Southern\u2019s major London hub, Victoria, to the Department for Transport on Thursday. The Department for Transport is playing down the idea of toughening strikes laws but not ruling it out as a last resort. Chris Philp, the Tory MP for Croydon South, said he will continue to push for a rule that when a strike occurs on critical public infrastructure, at least a 50% service is maintained and the strike should be \u201creasonable and proportionate,\u201d after meeting with Chris Grayling, the transport secretary, this week. \u201cWhen you have a system of driver-only operated trains operating on the network and the track today where a strike is taking place, it\u2019s clearly not safety concerns that are behind this,\u201d Philp said. \u201cWhen they are bringing such misery on commuters, when there are not safety concerns and no job losses, it\u2019s an issue for them to address.\u201d At least seven Conservative MPs whose constituencies are affected by the Southern strike are understood to be backing Philp\u2019s plan. Paul Scully, Conservative MP for Sutton and Cheam, told the Guardian he was one of them, saying more trade union legislation should be considered after the strike is over. \u201cIf you are having a dispute about automation, then the last thing you should do is show how the human factor of driving trains and acting as guards can be so disruptive. We\u2019ve got to get the dispute out the way and make sure we have talks but after that we have to look at making sure this can\u2019t happen again.\u201d Theresa May was pressed on the issue in prime minister\u2019s questions, branding it an \u201cappalling strike\u201d and criticising Labour\u2019s links to Aslef. The issue had been raised by Tim Loughton, MP for Shoreham, who said one of his constituents will struggle to get to University College Hospital London for life-saving cancer drug trials.",

      "bodyText": "Punch Taverns is at the centre of a takeover battle, with the Dutch brewer Heineken and one of the pub group\u2019s founders both vying for the company. Shares jumped 39% to 179p on Wednesday after Punch said it had received two competing offers. The group, which has more than 3,000 pubs across the UK, said it was in advanced discussions with Patron Capital Advisers about a potential 174p a share offer, which would value the company at about \u00a3390m. Before the approaches were revealed, Punch had a market value of about \u00a3286m. Under the terms of the proposal, Heineken would buy a portfolio of about 1,900 pubs from Patron immediately on completion of the deal, leaving Patron with about 1,300. The pub operator has received a second, higher, offer from Emerald Investment Partners, the private family firm run by Alan McIntosh, one of Punch Taverns\u2019 founders. Emerald has approached Punch with a potential cash offer of 185p a share. In a brief statement confirming the offers, Punch said: \u201cThe Emerald proposal is conditional on, amongst other things, arranging committed financing, confirmatory due diligence, and the recommendation of the board. The board is in discussions with Emerald regarding the Emerald proposal. \u201cThere can be no certainty that any firm offer will be made by either Patron or Emerald. A further announcement will be made in due course.\u201d Both suitors have a deadline of 5pm on 11 January to announce a firm intention to make an offer or walk away. A deal would follow a complex restructuring of Punch Taverns over recent years, including the demerger in 2011 of its managed pub division Spirit, which was later bought by Greene King. Last month Punch reported its first annual pre-tax profit since 2013. Heineken already owns 1,100 leased pubs in the UK through its Star Pubs &amp; Bars business.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The housing market slowed down in October, with the number of mortgages granted to home movers down 20% on a year ago, according to data from the Council of Mortgage Lenders. There was also a fall in the buy-to-let market, where activity has been hit by tax changes. But the lending market was bolstered by the amount of remortgage activity which hit its highest level since January 2009. The data was seized upon as evidence that the EU referendum in June had dented confidence and a sign that home owners were responding to the Bank of England\u2019s rate cut to 0.25% after the vote for Brexit. The CML said the amount borrowers were paying as a percentage of their household income to service repayments fell to a record low for both first-time buyers and home movers at 17.6%. Paul Smee, its director general, said that while buy-to-let lending was weak, the remortgage market was strong. \u201cThis appears to be linked to borrowers taking advantage of the repricing of mortgages following the base rate cut,\u201d he said. About 28,900 loans were granted to home movers in October, a 20% decrease on a year ago and 8% down month on month. Home movers borrowed \u00a35.9bn, down 9% on a the previous month and 18% on a year ago. The figures followed last month\u2019s warning from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors that number of properties on the market fell in October while the number of buyers rose. Remortgage activity totalled \u00a36.1bn, up 11% on September and 7% on a year ago. There was also a rise in the number of loans to 34,700, up 10% month on month and 5% on a year ago. Andy Knee, the chief executive of legal services provider LMS, said: \u201cOctober was a strong month for the remortgage market, with activity hitting an eight-year high, while the rest of the market stood still. The ramifications of June\u2019s referendum result are hitting home. \u201cHomeowners are taking advantage of low rates to secure reduced monthly repayments.\u201d Activity in the buy-to-let market \u2013 which is being monitored by the Bank of England \u2013 has been slowing as a result of the 3% stamp duty surcharge on second properties introduced in April. Lending increased 7% month on month to \u00a33bn, but remains 21% lower year on year. Nearly two-thirds of buy-to-let loans were remortgages rather than for house purchases.",

      "bodyText": "Ofgem has published its first energy company league table, comparing the most expensive standard tariffs with the cheapest deals on the market to provide \u201cgreater transparency to consumers\u201d. The energy secretary, Greg Clark, said the table would show consumers where they could save money and would increase transparency for the \u201cmillions\u201d of Britons who were overpaying for their gas and electricity by remaining on the expensive standard variable tariffs. The table will compare the average energy bill paid by a household on a standard variable tariff from the larger energy companies with deals from the 10 cheapest suppliers. Consumers can typically save \u00a3200 a year; this figure could be as much as \u00a3260 for those with the supplier Extra Energy. The energy regulator said last month that 66% of all households remained on expensive standard variable tariffs. The government is also launching a call for evidence on allowing customers access to accurate electronic data on how much energy they use to enable them to share it securely with price comparison websites in return for individual quotes. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) warned in June that 70% of people were on the more expensive \u201cdefault\u201d standard variable tariff, costing consumers \u00a31.4 bn more than a competitive market. Clark said: \u201cMillions of people across Britain continue to pay too much for their energy. The measures announced today are a positive step to help more people benefit from increased choice and competition. \u201cAs the government has made clear, where markets are not working for consumers \u2013 in energy or otherwise \u2013 we are prepared to act.\u201d The Citizens Advice chief executive, Gillian Guy, said: \u201cThis league table will lift the lid on the price difference between standard tariffs and cheaper deals, helping those customers who are currently paying over the odds for their gas and electricity identify a better rate. \u201cWe\u2019d also like to see energy companies do more off their own back to help customers who are on a low income, like moving them to a cheaper deal.\u201d Mark Todd, the co-founder of energyhelpline.com, said the energy price league table would expose just how expensive standard energy tariffs were and how much customers could save by switching. \u201cWe hope this publication acts as a clarion call for consumers to ditch these horrible tariffs this Christmas. Standard energy tariffs offer almost no protection against price rises as well as very high prices. \u201cThey are the worst of all worlds. Around two thirds of the population, about 40 million people, are blighted by their scourge and so considerably poorer as a result. The basic rule is: never be on a standard variable energy tariff \u2013 they are a rip-off,\u201d he said. Energy UK figures released on Wednesday showed more than 4 million customers switched electricity supplier this year, \u201ceclipsing\u201d the past three years, while more than 400,000 switched last month \u2013 the highest figure since November 2013. Lawrence Slade, the chief executive of the industry body Energy UK, said: \u201cA record number of people have switched electricity supplier in 2016. This is fantastic progress, but more needs to be done. \u201cOver 40 companies across the industry, big and small, are working hard to win customers. I\u2019d encourage everyone to look at the best deal for them, whether that is one that offers a lower price or better customer service, there are choices for everyone.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Southern rail passengers are facing more misery with no trains running at all for a second consecutive day, as unions and the company meet at Acas to seek a breakthrough in the long-running dispute. Drivers from Aslef have continued their strike, with a third day planned for Friday. Talks between Southern\u2019s owner, Govia Thameslink Railway, Aslef, and the RMT union will start at 10am on Wednesday, with hopes that the escalating row and the extreme disruption will push the two sides into some form of agreement. But previous talks broke down swiftly as the company continued to insist on the flexibility to run trains without a second crew member in some circumstances \u2013 a red line for the unions who fear jobs will be lost or deskilled, as the company, and more broadly the government, pushes to introduce more driver-only-operated trains. Talks come after Tuesday saw recriminations from both sides, with the train drivers\u2019 union Aslef accusing the government of blocking serious talks and manipulating the Southern dispute while the transport secretary, Chris Grayling, said the unions had embarked on an unnecessary political strike. Mick Whelan, Aslef\u2019s general secretary, said: \u201cThe government is underwriting and causing the pain and misery of the travelling public. The reality is that the whole of this has been driven by the Department for Transport and their desire for driver-only operation.\u201d The strike prompted more calls from the Tory right for limits on strikes by transport workers. The Tory MP Chris Philp, who represents the badly affected constituency of Croydon South, called for urgent legislation to end the misery for passengers. Philp, one member of a group that has been meeting regularly with Grayling and the rail minister Paul Maynard, said he wanted a rule that when a strike occurs on critical public infrastructure, at least a 50% service is maintained and the strike should be \u201creasonable and proportionate\u201d. He also said it should be mandatory to attend mediation at Acas. The Guardian understands that Grayling had an amicable meeting with Tory MPs on Tuesday and has agreed to keep legislation on the table, but it is not his preferred option. No 10 meanwhile said that the strikes were \u201ccausing misery for hundreds of thousands of commuters\u201d and said it would review recent trade union legislation to see if more legislation was necessary. \u201cObviously we have recently passed legislation on unions and it\u2019s right that we review that to see if that is working in practice,\u201d the prime minister\u2019s spokesman said. Grayling on Tuesday said he was willing to meet unions and released a letter to Aslef complaining that he had had no reply to his offer of a meeting, subject to Aslef calling off strikes. Whelan responded: \u201cIn one breath, he\u2019s saying he won\u2019t get involved; in the other, he\u2019s saying we\u2019re refusing to meet him. But why would we if he\u2019s not going to say anything?\u201d All of Southern\u2019s 2,242 weekday services, which normally carry more than 300,000 passengers, have been cancelled again, causing the worst strike-led disruption since privatisation. Severe congestion was expected at rush hour elsewhere as passengers attempt to use other methods of travel. Southern has advised its customers not to travel. A commuter group is planning a protest march from Southern\u2019s major London hub, Victoria, to the Department for Transport on Thursday. If no resolution is found, even without a strike on Thursday, an ongoing overtime ban will seriously disrupt services, while conductors in the RMT union will walk out for two days from Monday.",

      "bodyText": "Leading shares have slipped back after mixed UK unemployment figures and ahead of the expected US interest rate rise from the Federal Reserve later on Wednesday. A couple of trading updates have had the opposite effect on the share prices of the companies involved. Micro Focus, the IT firm paying $8.8bn for Hewlett Packard Enterprise\u2019s software business, has jumped 4% to \u00a322.16 following a 22.4% rise in half year underlying earnings. It said the deal was due to be completed in third quarter. Numis, which is advising on the HPE transaction, said: Micro Focus has outperformed on nearly all levels in the first half, giving a net 9% EPS beat and 3% full year upgrade. 1.0% underlying revenue growth is well ahead of our -2% forecast, although management reiterate full year guidance of -2% to 0%, and we note that timing of deal closures can impact individual periods, thus 1% growth should not be automatically extrapolated into the second half. However, it clearly provides strong support for the achievability of management\u2019s \u201cmodest growth\u201d goal. In a hold note, Julian Yates at Investec said: Full-year guidance was not raised, implying a softer second half, but we feel this is partly due to conservatism and also to reduce the reliance on [Linux specialist] SUSE having to sustain this growth level. We expect the stock to move up today, but continue to struggle to justify prices above 2400p given the extent of the HPE task and time horizon to deliver required synergies. But Dixons Carphone is down more than 5% at 346.6p as the electrical specialist reported a 19% rise in first half profits but warned of more uncertain times ahead. Among the other fallers, Antofagasta has fallen 19.5p to 719p as JP Morgan cut its recommendation from neutral to underweight, while housebuilders were also under pressure, with Persimmon down 28p at \u00a316.71. Overall the FTSE 100 is currently 11.02 points lower at 6957.55 as investors await the Fed\u2019s decision. Caxton FX analyst Alexandra Russell-Oliver said: The Fed is expected to announce a second rate hike this evening (19:00GMT), one year after raising rates for the first time since 2006. The expected increase is by 25 basis points to a target range of 0.50% to 0.75%. While the decision has been almost completely priced in by markets, there could still be some additional dollar gains, depending on the tone of any forward guidance given. A relatively hawkish outlook on rate hikes next year would strengthen the dollar, while a more cautious tone than expected could weigh on the dollar. Lower down the market payments specialist Paysafe has recovered some ground after Tuesday\u2019s slump, up 10p at 315.7p. The company was hit by a negative report from a short seller, but maintained the comments were either inaccurate or old. Ladbrokes Coral has climbed 2.8p to 118.8p after a bid battle for an Australian lottery operator, with a consortium including Macquarie and KKR breaking into a proposed merger with Tabcorp Holdings. But NMC Health has fallen 65p to \u00a313.83 as the United Arab Emirates group agreed to buy a hospital in Sharjah for $560m and unvield a placing of around 9.9% of the business. IQE has jumped 7% to 37.5p after the semiconductor materials maker forecast full year revenues ahead of previous expectations, partly due to the fall in the pound since the Brexit vote.",

Google Chromecast, televisions and tablets were among the best sellers on the discount shopping day in November that began in the US but has been adopted in the UK in recent years. Sales of smart fitness gadgets were up 241% year on year, while dashcam sales rose 250%, drone sales were up 60%, and virtual reality sets rose tenfold. Reporting results for the first half of the financial year, the retailer said the EU referendum result had not put consumers off from spending, but added it was prepared for potential volatility ahead. Seb James, the Dixons Carphone chief executive, said: \u201cWe remain optimistic about our ability to continue to gain market share in all our key markets, and, while we have still not seen any effect on consumer demand as a consequence of Brexit, we have been planning for the possibility of more uncertain times ahead. \u201cWe have been focusing on reducing our fixed cost base ... and generally preparing for all eventualities \u2013 just in case.\u201d The company reported an 11% rise in revenue to \u00a34.9bn in the first half of the year ending on 29 October. Pre-tax profit increased by a third to \u00a3104m. Like-for-like sales \u2013 stripping out the impact of stores open for less than a year \u2013 rose by 5% in the UK, 7% in southern Europe and 2% in the Nordic countries. However, shares fell nearly 4% despite the upbeat message, making Dixons Carphone the biggest faller on the FTSE 100. Humphrey Singer, the finance director, said he expected a \u201cgreat\u201d Christmas trading period and was not worried about prospects for the business in 2017. Economists have predicted that next year will be a difficult one for consumers amid rising inflation, weak wage growth, higher unemployment and low growth. \u201cWe\u2019ll make our luck and will be successful regardless of the economic background. It\u2019s sensible to have a set of contingencies to make sure you\u2019re flexible and ready for any scenario. But we\u2019re not doing anything differently,\u201d Singer said. The retailer said it had not been hit by the sharp drop in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote in June, because more than 90% of its purchases are made in sterling.

The reality is that the whole of this has been driven by the Department for Transport and their desire for driver-only operation.\u201d Tory MP Chris Philp, who represents the badly affected constituency of Croydon South, called for urgent legislation to end the misery for passengers. Philp, one member of a group that has been meeting regularly with Grayling and minister Paul Maynard, said he wanted a rule that when a strike occurs on critical public infrastructure, at least a 50% service is maintained and the strike should be \u201creasonable and proportionate\u201d. He also said it should be mandatory to attend mediation at Acas. The Guardian understands that Grayling had an amicable meeting with Tory MPs on Tuesday and has agreed to keep legislation on the table, but because of the time that would be involved it is not his preferred option. Grayling said he was willing to meet unions and released a letter to Aslef complaining that he had had no reply to his offer of a meeting, subject to Aslef calling off strikes. Whelan responded: \u201cIn one breath, he\u2019s saying he won\u2019t get involved; in the other, he\u2019s saying we\u2019re refusing to meet him. But why would we if he\u2019s not going to say anything?\u201d The chance of an imminent breakthrough appears slim, as previous talks have broken down with no other concessions offered before talks begin. Whelan said: \u201cWe\u2019re always open to talks. We want to move this forward. We don\u2019t want to have people out on the streets losing money. But the attitude of the minister and the government doesn\u2019t allow the franchisee any latitude to move. The company have got to be involved, but we have to feel that they have the latitude to talk.\u201d All of Southern\u2019s 2,242 weekday services, which normally carry more than 300,000 passengers, were cancelled, causing the worst strike-led disruption since privatisation. Passengers who attempted to use other methods of travel were hampered by severe traffic congestion and overcrowded buses and trams, compounded by problems on the Victoria tube line, which resulted in crowds being locked outside its southern terminus in Brixton at rush hour. A commuter group is planning a protest march from Southern\u2019s major London hub, Victoria, to the Department for Transport on Thursday evening, calling for Grayling to quit unless he can restore services. Aslef said Southern\u2019s owner, Govia Thameslink Railway, appeared to reject a potential agreement in talks held in September after consultation with the DfT. Whelan said: \u201cOn Sunday, we were having private and confidential conversations with the company. I was unaware that Mr Grayling was privy to or organising those conversations until this morning when I heard him on the Today programme.\u201d Earlier, when asked if he would consider stripping GTR of the franchise, or making it harder for transport unions to strike, Grayling told the BBC: \u201cWe are thinking very carefully about how we take things forward. I\u2019m not going to rule anything in or anything out today.\u201d Grayling said the strike was completely unnecessary and that use of driver-only operated trains \u2013 the issue at the heart of the dispute \u2013 happened elsewhere on the London-Brighton line and beyond. \u201cThe reality is these are systems they have been using for years and have been passed as perfectly safe,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one\u2019s losing their job, no one\u2019s losing any money. These guys have got long-term job security and yet the union\u2019s insisting on bringing the network to a halt and causing chaos when the independent inspector says it is perfectly safe. If that\u2019s not politically motivated, I don\u2019t know what is.\u201d GTR had continued to take legal action against Aslef until Monday afternoon, when the court of appeal again dismissed the company\u2019s attempt to win an injunction to stop the strike. Any possible resolution will not come in time for Southern services to be restored on Wednesday, when the strike will continue, with a further 24-hour strike by drivers on Friday. An ongoing overtime ban will seriously disrupt services on Thursday and beyond, while conductors in the RMT union will walk out for two days from Monday.",

      "bodyText": "The governor of the Bank of England has warned that the fight against climate change will be jeopardised unless companies with big carbon footprints come clean about their exposure to global warming risks. Writing in today\u2019s Guardian, Mark Carney says a new set of guidelines drawn up over the past year should be implemented so that investors can allocate capital to those companies with the best ideas to hit the target of keeping the rise in global temperature to less than 2C. Carney, writing jointly with the former New York City mayor, Michael Bloomberg, said citizens, consumers, businesses, governments and international organisations were all taking action in response to extreme weather events. \u201cThe challenge is that investors currently don\u2019t have the information to respond to these developments,\u201d they said. \u201cThis must change if financial markets are going to do what they do best: allocate capital to manage risks and seize new opportunities. Without the necessary information, market adjustments to climate change will be incomplete, late and potentially destabilising.\u201d Bloomberg has been heading a taskforce into climate-related financial disclosures set up in December 2015 by the Financial Stability Board, an international body established by the G20 in the aftermath of the 2008-09 crash with the aim of reducing risks in global markets. Carney and Bloomberg said in their article that financial disclosure was \u201cessential to a market-based solution to climate change\u201d. They add: \u201cA properly functioning market will price in the risks associated with climate change and reward firms that mitigate them. As its impact becomes more commonplace and public policy responses more active, climate change has become a material risk that isn\u2019t properly disclosed.\u201d Bloomberg\u2019s taskforce will on Wednesday publish its recommendations for a voluntary disclosure code. It will cover four areas considered by Carney and Bloomberg to be vital to how businesses operate \u2013 governance, strategy, risk management and metrics. The taskforce included representatives of banks such as Barclays, the world\u2019s biggest mining company BHP Billiton, the Indian steelmaker Tata and the chemical company Dow. All members of the taskforce had signed up to the disclosure recommendations, Carney and Bloomberg said. \u201cWe encourage others to participate in the consultation, to become early adopters thereafter, and to encourage firms in which they invest to also make the disclosures.\u201d",
