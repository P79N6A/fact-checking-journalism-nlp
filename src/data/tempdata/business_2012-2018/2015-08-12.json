      "bodyText": "US stocks rallied late on Wednesday afternoon following an earlier worldwide markets slump due to concerns about the health of the Chinese economy. The major US stock indices end the day roughly flat, after having dropped by between 1-2% in earlier trading due to investors worries that the world\u2019s second-largest economy may be in worse shape than had been believed after China took the surprise move of devaluing the yuan for the second consecutive day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which had touched a six-month low earlier in the day, ended the day flat at 17,402 points, the Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s 500 was up 0.1% to 2,086 and the Nasdaq, which had dropped as much as 1.7% at one point, closed up 0.15% to 5,044. US companies with the biggest exposures to China including car companies and Apple, for whom China is key growth area, had been the biggest fallers. But they recovered late in the day to end roughly flat or higher. The earlier US markets slide had followed drops on stock markets around the world. In China the Shanghai composite lost 1.03%, while the Nikkei fell 1.58%, or 327.98 points. The FTSE 100 closed down 1.4%, Germany\u2019s DAX lost 3.3% and France\u2019s CAC 40 was 3.4% lower. Analyst fear that a slowdown in China\u2019s growth could have a ripple effect on the whole of the global economy. \u201cChina\u2019s currency moves will hurt appetite for risky assets such as equities and commodities,\u201d Rajeev De Mello, head of Asian fixed income at Schroders in Singapore, said. \u201cWhile it is too early to say whether this is the beginning of a sustained devaluation of the yuan, other central banks may be forced to follow suit and that may trigger a fresh round of currency weakening around the emerging world.\u201d Guillermo Felices, an analyst at Barclays, said: \u201cRisky assets remain under pressure. A key market concern is that the latest (Chinese) measures respond to much weaker Chinese growth than expected.\u201d The yuan hit a four-year low against the dollar on Wednesday, its weakest since August 2011, after the Chinese central bank set the yuan\u2019s daily midpoint even weaker than in Tuesday\u2019s devaluation. With the bank having said that Tuesday\u2019s move was a \u201cone-off depreciation\u201d, the rapid drop in the value of China\u2019s currency \u2013 about 4% in the past two days \u2013 dealt a blow to the appetite for risky assets, and markets across the region plunged amid concerns that Beijing has embarked on a damaging currency war. Contributing to the Chinese slump were worse-than-expected economic figures with fixed-asset investment falling short of expectations. The crucial gauge on the country\u2019s growth came in at 11.2% for the first seven months from the same period last year, according to official data. Economists had forecast a rise of 11.5%.",

Those numbers are the value of his shareholding in the mining and commodity-trading company at flotation in 2011 and now. Yes, Glencore\u2019s share price really has fallen by two-thirds, from 530p to 180p, since it came to market with a fanfare. Among London\u2019s big miners, only Anglo-American has done worse. This week alone the fall has been 10% as the China-inspired rout has run through commodity markets and mining stocks. Glencore is being whacked harder than the likes of BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto for a simple reason \u2013 relative to earnings, it has a lot more debt. Analysts predict borrowings will stand at about $48bn when the company reports half-year numbers next week, which is a hell of a sum even for a business making top-line (before interest and tax) earnings of $10bn-$12bn. Bold borrowings aren\u2019t quite what they seem, it should be said, because Glencore\u2019s marketing division holds a stockpile of commodities as inventories that can be turned into cash. Viewed that way, net debt might be nearer $30.5bn at year-end, estimates JP Morgan Cazenove. But here\u2019s the rub: Glencore might have to go ahead and turn some of that stock into cash if its wants to save its BBB credit rating. \u201cAt spot commodity prices, we calculate net debt needs to fall $16bn by year-end 2016 to safeguard Glencore\u2019s BBB credit rating,\u201d says JP Morgan. Preservation of BBB is a financial priority, Glencore said in March, for the sound reason that a healthy rating is vital to keep funding costs low in the trading-cum-marketing division. It\u2019s a financial challenge caused by the plunge in prices that is undermining profits on the other side of Glencore \u2013 the mining operation concentrated on the old Xstrata assets, which are skewed towards copper and coal. If you\u2019re an optimist on Glencore, the company has enormous financial flexibility. The marketing division, famed for being able to make profits in all weathers, can be reined in to reduce debt, albeit at the cost of lower earnings the following year. \u201cI am extremely confident there is no liquidity crunch coming for Glencore,\u201d says Richard Buxton, well-regarded fund manager at Old Mutual. For now, though, the bears have the upper hand, and the world of big mining is agog. Glasenberg is the industry\u2019s towering figure with a habit of telling rivals how they\u2019ve messed up their businesses by over-investing at the wrong moment in the commodity cycle. At 180p, though, the stock market is saying it is Glencore, not BHP or Rio, that needs to show how it can manage the pain in the downturn. A production report lands on Thursday, but nothing less than a full strategic update will suffice with the interims. China causes confusion Super Thursday \u2013 the Bank of England\u2019s overload of information on inflation projections and interest rates \u2013 was only a week ago. But, already, the outlook seems slightly less clear. China is the chief source of confusion, of course. Beijing\u2019s \u201cone-off\u201d adjustment to the yuan has been followed by a second. They are baby steps, it might be argued, rather than a declaration of currency war that will deliver deflation in the west. On the other hand: 2% here, 2% there, and pretty soon you\u2019re talking serious devaluation. The other puzzle is closer to home \u2013 the labour market. A week ago, governor Mark Carney was insistent that the employment market is tightening, despite the latest figures showing unemployment rising slightly and employment growth slowing. Deputy governor Ben Broadbent backed him up: \u201cIt\u2019s only in the latest data you see this rise in unemployment. The data are also quite volatile on a short-term basis, so we\u2019ll have to see whether this persists.\u201d Well, it\u2019s still persisting. The number of people in work was 63,000 lower in the three months to June than in the previous quarter, the Office for National Statistics said on Wednesday, and the number of unemployed rose by 25,000. These are small movements and two months of data doesn\u2019t mean the market has definitely turned. All the same, last week\u2019s statements look too confident. Light at last for Balfour It\u2019s a miracle: Balfour Beatty has spoken and hasn\u2019t announced fresh write-downs. Last month\u2019s collection of charges for underpriced contracts still ruined Wednesday\u2019s half-year figures \u2013 pre-tax losses were \u00a3150m \u2013 but there is now a sense that new-ish chief executive Leo Quinn can look forwards. Investors are: the share price has risen by almost a fifth since July\u2019s write-downs. That\u2019s understandable. Balfour\u2019s balance sheet is solid, and there is the backing of \u00a31.2bn-worth of PPI assets. Plus, the great advantage with construction companies is that the contracts rarely run for longer than two or three years, allowing the poison to wash away. Quinn still has to prove Balfour can generate acceptable construction margins of 2%-3%. But the possibility of a decent recovery exists.",

      "bodyText": "Employment opportunities in Britain\u2019s stalling labour market are largely going to workers from the rest of the European Union, according to the latest official data showing a second monthly increase in the number of people out of work. Highlighting the impact of the enlargement of the EU since the turn of the millennium to include former Soviet bloc countries, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said almost three-quarters of the employment growth in the past year was accounted for by non-UK citizens. The number of non-UK nationals working in Britain increased by 257,000 to 3.1 million, while the number of working UK nationals rose by 84,000 to 27.7 million. Demand for labour fell during the spring, with 63,000 fewer people employed in the three months ending in June than in the first quarter of the year. During that period, employment fell by 146,000 among UK nationals and rose by 91,000 among workers from overseas. But the ONS warned that the figures were not seasonally adjusted and said the annual data provided a better comparison. However, research by the National Institute of Economic and Social Research has shown that a cut in the number of migrants would have a negative impact on the economy. The figures from the Office for National Statistics published on Wednesday showed that wages growth lost momentum in December for an eighth straight month. Analysts said the drop in the annual wages growth rate to 1.9% indicated that a first UK interest rate rise since the financial crash would be even further away than expected. The Bank of England has highlighted the decline in wages growth as one of the main reasons for keeping the base rate at 0.5%. Until the start of the new year policymakers at the Bank were expected to raise rates by the summer or autumn at the latest, but a delay is now likely until at least the spring of 2017. Since 1997, the proportion of employment accounted for by non-UK nationals hads increased climbed from 3.7% to 10.3%, it said. Almost the entireall the increase since the global financial crisis of 2007-2008 has been accounted for by the European Union citizens. The latest ONS figures show that employment among EU citizens born outside the UK hads risen above two 2 million for the first time. Of the total, 839,000 were born in the 14 countries that were part of the EU before its enlargement, while 973,000 came from the eight countries that became members in 2004. Bank of England agents who provide grassroots information for Threadneedle Street about the state of the economy in UK regions said in their latest report released on Wednesday that firms were increasingly reliant on workers from overseas. They said: \u201cRecruitment agencies reported difficulty in filling semi-unskilled and unskilled positions and that reliance on migrant workers was increasing in a range of areas.\u201d The City said the 25,000 increase in unemployment on the internationally- agreed measure in the three months ending in June together with a lack of evidence of wage inflation would make it harder for the Bbank to justify an early increase in interest rates. Financial markets have been expecting the fall in unemployment to 5.6% of the workforce to generate pressures for higher pay. The ONS said regular pay for employees stood at \u00a3463 a week in June, up 2.8% on a year earlier. The annual growth rate was unchanged on the previous month. Total pay including bonuses was \u00a3488 a week, with the growth rate dropping from 3.2% to 2.8%. The state of the labour market is one of the most important indicators looked at by Threadneedle Street\u2019s the bBank\u2019s monetary policy committee, and the current figures point to falling demand for jobs, fewer hours being worked, and little evidence of a surge in pay inflation. Chartered Institute for Personnel and Development (CIPD) labour market adviser Gerwyn Davies, a labour market adviser for the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, said: \u201cThe modest slowing in pay growth suggests that pay pressures are not growing as quickly as some commentators expect.\u201d\u201c This is perhaps unsurprising given the increase in the number of young people and EU migrants in employment.\u201d David Freeman, an ONS statistician at the Office for National Statistics, said: \u201cThis is now the second consecutive time we\u2019ve reported fewer people in work on the quarter. While it\u2019s still too early to conclude that the jobs market is levelling off, these figures certainly strengthen that possibility.\u201d John Philpott, from of the employment consultancy The Jobs Economist, said: \u201cThe most disappointing feature of the latest data is that the apparent hiatus in the jobs recovery is not offset by faster pay growth -\u2013 the rate of growth of regular pay, excluding bonuses, for employees remaining unchanged at 2.8% -\u2013 which might have indicated a pick-up in labour productivity. A combination of jobs standstill and lack of momentum in pay therefore makes this the least positive set of UK labour market figures for some considerable time.\u201d Unemployment on the internationally- agreed measure rose to 1.85mn million between April and June, while the number of people employed felldropped to 31.03mn million. The jobless total was still 221,000 lower in the second quarter of 2015 than in the same period three months a year earlier, according to the ONS.

      "bodyText": "It all sounded different before the election. The chancellor, George Osborne, had promised a northern powerhouse, connecting the cities of the north into one booming economic entity, forged by fast transport connections. The electrification of the TransPennine rail route between Manchester and Leeds and the Midland mainline from Sheffield were two big transport goodies around the corner. And why stop there? Even the prime minister popped up to Leeds to propose HS3, a sequel to the HS2 high-speed rail line, with a vague but exciting promise of new cross-Pennine rail links. Now, on the packed Friday evening train doing the slow traverse from Manchester Piccadilly to Leeds, scepticism is rife. It is standing room only, and little of that, and most commuters do not appear optimistic they will find a seat. A little more than a month has elapsed since the government announced that its manifesto pledges for vital rail upgrades would not, after all, be delivered. Passengers asked about the shelved electrification plans mainly shrug their shoulders, as if they never expected them to go ahead in the first place. One says bluntly: \u201cGeorge Osborne spoke a load of rubbish. I work in London so I know how fast the trains can be. You\u2019ll never get fast trains up here.\u201d It can feel that way on the 43-mile journey between two of the great cities of the north, a relatively short distance that still takes an hour on trains barely chugging faster than the steam locomotives that would have passed in the days when the Huddersfield mills were booming. Trains from another era still ply the north, from the hated Pacers \u2013 banished by ministerial decree from 2020 \u2013 to the 50-year old carriages and diesel locomotives that once hauled nuclear waste and have now resurfaced on Cumbria\u2019s passenger services. A passenger, who gave his name only as Simon, said he was struggling to get used to the commute. \u201cIt would make such a difference to me if they electrified the train line. Having a shorter journey would be great. After all, I pay enough for my ticket.\u201d Such sentiments will be familiar to the transport secretary, Patrick McLoughlin, who intervened to overrule civil servants\u2019 doubts over the costs of scrapping Pacers, and was doubtless genuinely dismayed at the bad tidings he had to unveil in June. McLoughlin told the Commons there would be a \u201cpause\u201d to the upgrades. This was due to a growing tally of missed targets and overspend on works being carried out elsewhere by Network Rail, the government-owned operator of Britain\u2019s rail infrastructure. He also announced two reviews: one, by the new chairman, Peter Hendy, to establish just what Network Rail could feasibly still deliver in its abortive five-year plan. Hendy, due to report in September, may yet surprise everyone by restoring parts of the paused programmes to the schedule. More likely, he will identify further schemes whose prospects appear unrealistic before 2019, given the problems of supply, overspend and caps on borrowing. East West rail, which plans to reopen links around Oxford to establish a route from East Anglia across the home counties, is one project that may join the Midland mainline and TransPennine schemes in the sidings. While Hendy considers the art of the possible, Dame Colette Bowe, a board member at the Department for Transport, will be examining the folly of botched planning. The remit of this second review, according to McLoughlin, is \u201cto look at lessons learned and to make recommendations for better investment planning in future\u201d, widely read as identifying who got what wrong. Network Rail itself will obviously top that list, its problems underlined this week when it was fined \u00a32m by the rail regulator for mishandling upgrades at London Bridge station. Speaking in June, McLoughlin was clear that Network Rail was making too many errors across the board, even as he acknowledged that the engineering challenge was fiendishly difficult. \u201cBut that is no excuse. All of these problems could and should have been foreseen by Network Rail.\u201d While the chief executive, Mark Carne, only came into the organisation after a \u00a338.5bn, five-year works programme was rubberstamped, he may not escape the flak. Some have questioned the wisdom of appointing a boss from outside the rail industry \u2013 and the recent influx of rail veterans onto the board has reinforced the impression that the former oil industry executive needed support. But Network Rail believes there are other candidates for a Bowe lashing, to ensure the blame is shared around. Few expect to see ministers lambasted by a DfT board member, but McLoughlin had, however well briefed, signed up to a cost adjustment mechanism that was liable to raise the bill considerably once schemes were properly assessed. And after that first became apparent in summer 2014, notably on the increasing cost of electrification of the Great Western route, the government remained keen to promote and promise more rail schemes. Network Rail\u2019s undoing was in part its willingness to accede to an ever growing list of demands, rather than turn down the happy flow of investment. Fire may also be turned on the regulator, the Office of Rail and Road, which was tasked with monitoring spending and progress of the funding plan. Shortly before imposing the London Bridge fine, it issued another warning letter to Network Rail, detailing its concerns in a scathing list, from inadequate governance to low productivity and weak assurances over safety. But the ORR was also tasked with adjudicating on the \u00a338.5bn budget back in 2013. At the time it ruled that the whole programme could be delivered for \u00a32bn less than the state was prepared to cough up, despite Network Rail\u2019s furious protests. Given what has since emerged, that looks optimistic or ill-judged. While the ORR did warn of missed targets and some overspend, some feel it did not sound the klaxon loudly enough. However, in the latest letter \u2013 ORR\u2019s turn in what one industry leader calls \u201cthe desperate rounds of arse-covering\u201d \u2013 the regulator sets out how it has raised concerns since July 2014. Nonetheless, the regulator\u2019s words will again force Network Rail to examine its practices, despite its supporters pointing to the numerous projects it has successfully delivered \u2013 from swiftly rescuing the battered Dawlish line in south-west England to rebuilding major stations \u2013 and the labour of armies of workers through nights and holidays to maintain a railway used more intensively than ever. David Higgins, the ex-Network Rail chief now leading HS2, has named another guilty party \u2013 the Office for National Statistics. Their decision to reclassify Network Rail as a public body, putting its debt on the state balance sheet, has ultimately had profound consequences because it has given the rail company less flexibility in terms of funding. He told the Guardian that instead of talking of a crisis in the railways, \u201cpeople need to stop and identify that as a cause\u201d. Certainly, it focused the mind of ministers \u2013 and the Treasury \u2013 on money that was being spent. But it shouldn\u2019t exculpate Network Rail, which had been living it large on a credit card that has now racked up \u00a338bn of debt. Until the debt reclassification last September, a fantasy budget might not have been an insurmountable problem for Network Rail, as it could borrow at will and smooth over poor planning. Now, under Treasury scrutiny, the flexibility has gone. A third review, led by Nicola Shaw, the chief executive of HS1, which runs from London St Pancras to the Channel Tunnel, will have until next spring to examine the structures and financing of Network Rail. There has been talk of breaking up the business, which echoes Carne\u2019s own vision for creating eight distinct regional entities. There are also reports of a desire within Network Rail to sell a stake in the company to the private sector. Meanwhile, Carne still hopes to bring forward his vision for a railway transformed by digital technology, which would overhaul signalling and allow more trains onto the network. The limit of Network Rail\u2019s ambitions may become clearer after the autumn\u2019s reviews are concluded, with some uncomfortable reading guaranteed. But the industry will have fresh successes to point to, including the opening of the redeveloped Birmingham New Street and in particular the new Scottish Borders Railway. Despite the indefinite pause to one set of promised improvements in the north, others have been delivered, including electrification of tracks between Liverpool and Manchester this year. At the sharp end, a train guard at Manchester Victoria confirms: \u201cPeople have been much happier with the electrified line. I wish we had more of them \u2013 it would certainly make my job a lot easier.\u201d About the ropier, overcrowded, old diesel trains, he says: \u201cSometimes I can\u2019t look passengers in the eye because I know how much money they\u2019ve paid for their ticket.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>It all sounded different before the election. The chancellor, George Osborne, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/the-northerner/2015/mar/18/northern-powerhouse-is-north-really-winner-2015-budget\">had promised a northern powerhouse</a>, connecting the cities of the north into one booming economic entity, forged by fast transport connections. The electrification of the TransPennine rail route between Manchester and Leeds and the Midland mainline from Sheffield were two big transport goodies around the corner. And why stop there? Even the prime minister <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/oct/27/hs3-cross-pennine-railway-line-hs2-david-cameron\">popped up to Leeds to propose HS3, a sequel to the HS2 high-speed rail line</a>, with a vague but exciting promise of new cross-Pennine rail links.</p> <p>Now, on the packed Friday evening train doing the slow traverse from Manchester Piccadilly to Leeds, scepticism is rife. It is standing room only, and little of that, and most commuters do not appear optimistic they will find a seat. A little more than a month has elapsed since the government announced that its manifesto pledges for vital rail upgrades <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/the-northerner/2015/jun/25/northern-powerhouse-tories-transpennine-sheffield-mainline-upgrades-cancelled\">would not, after all, be delivered</a>. Passengers asked about the <a href=\"http://www.networkrail.co.uk/aspx/12273.aspx\">shelved electrification plans</a> mainly shrug their shoulders, as if they never expected them to go ahead in the first place. One says bluntly: \u201cGeorge Osborne spoke a load of rubbish. I work in London so I know how fast the trains can be. You\u2019ll never get fast trains up here.\u201d </p> <p>It can feel that way on the 43-mile journey between two of the great cities of the north, a relatively short distance that still takes an hour on trains barely chugging faster than the steam locomotives that would have passed in the days when the Huddersfield mills were booming. Trains from another era still ply the north, from the hated Pacers \u2013 banished by ministerial decree from 2020 \u2013 to the 50-year old carriages and diesel locomotives that once hauled nuclear waste and have now resurfaced on Cumbria\u2019s passenger services. A passenger, who gave his name only as Simon, said he was struggling to get used to the commute. \u201cIt would make such a difference to me if they electrified the train line. Having a shorter journey would be great. After all, I pay enough for my ticket.\u201d</p> <p>Such sentiments will be familiar to the transport secretary, Patrick McLoughlin, who intervened to overrule civil servants\u2019 doubts over the costs of scrapping Pacers, and was doubtless genuinely dismayed at the bad tidings he had to unveil in June. McLoughlin told the Commons there would be a \u201cpause\u201d to the upgrades. This was due to a growing tally of missed targets and overspend on works being carried out elsewhere by Network Rail, the government-owned operator of Britain\u2019s rail infrastructure. </p> <p>He also announced two reviews: one, by the new chairman, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/03/ex-london-transport-chief-completes-move-national-rail\">Peter Hendy</a>, to establish just what Network Rail could feasibly still deliver in its abortive five-year plan. Hendy, due to report in September, may yet surprise everyone by restoring parts of the paused programmes to the schedule. More likely, he will identify further schemes whose prospects appear unrealistic before 2019, given the problems of supply, overspend and caps on borrowing. East West rail, which plans to reopen links around Oxford to establish a route from East Anglia across the home counties, is one project that may join the Midland mainline and TransPennine schemes in the sidings. </p> <p>While Hendy considers the art of the possible, Dame Colette Bowe, a board member at the Department for Transport, will be examining the folly of botched planning. The <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/network-rails-performance\">remit of this second review</a>, according to McLoughlin, is \u201cto look at lessons learned and to make recommendations for better investment planning in future\u201d, widely read as identifying who got what wrong. </p> <p>Network Rail itself will obviously top that list, its problems underlined this week when it was fined \u00a32m by the rail regulator for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/aug/10/rail-watchdog-fines-network-rail-2m-london-bridge\">mishandling upgrades at London Bridge station</a>. Speaking in June, McLoughlin was clear that Network Rail was making too many errors across the board, even as he acknowledged that the engineering challenge was fiendishly difficult. \u201cBut that is no excuse. All of these problems could and should have been foreseen by Network Rail.\u201d While the chief executive, Mark Carne, only came into the organisation after a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/12/network-rails-five-year-plan-way-off-track-in-first-year-regulator-warns\">\u00a338.5bn, five-year works programme</a> was rubberstamped, he may not escape the flak. Some have questioned the wisdom of appointing a boss from outside the rail industry \u2013 and the recent influx of rail veterans onto the board has reinforced the impression that the former oil industry executive needed support. </p> <p>But Network Rail believes there are other candidates for a Bowe lashing, to ensure the blame is shared around. Few expect to see ministers lambasted by a DfT board member, but McLoughlin had, however well briefed, signed up to a cost adjustment mechanism that was liable to raise the bill considerably once schemes were properly assessed. And after that first became apparent in summer 2014, notably on the increasing cost of electrification of the Great Western route, the government remained keen to promote and promise more rail schemes. Network Rail\u2019s undoing was in part its willingness to accede to an ever growing list of demands, rather than turn down the happy flow of investment.</p> <p>Fire may also be turned on the regulator, the Office of Rail and Road, which was tasked with monitoring spending and progress of the funding plan. Shortly before imposing the London Bridge fine, <a href=\"http://orr.gov.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0009/18684/network-rail-delivery-of-enhancement-programmes-2015-08-06.pdf\">it issued another warning letter to Network Rail</a>, detailing its concerns in a scathing list, from inadequate governance to low productivity and weak assurances over safety. But the ORR was also tasked with adjudicating on the \u00a338.5bn budget back in 2013. At the time it ruled that the whole programme could be delivered for \u00a32bn less than the state was prepared to cough up, despite Network Rail\u2019s furious protests. Given what has since emerged, that looks optimistic or ill-judged. While the ORR did warn of missed targets and some overspend, some feel it did not sound the klaxon loudly enough. However, in the latest letter \u2013 ORR\u2019s turn in what one industry leader calls \u201cthe desperate rounds of arse-covering\u201d \u2013 the regulator sets out how it has raised concerns since July 2014.</p> <p>Nonetheless, the regulator\u2019s words will again force Network Rail to examine its practices, despite its supporters pointing to the numerous projects it has successfully delivered \u2013 from swiftly rescuing the battered Dawlish line in south-west England to rebuilding major stations \u2013 and the labour of armies of workers through nights and holidays to maintain a railway used more intensively than ever. </p> <p>David Higgins, the ex-Network Rail chief now leading HS2, has named another guilty party \u2013 the Office for National Statistics. Their decision to reclassify Network Rail as a public body, putting its debt on the state balance sheet, has ultimately had profound consequences because it has given the rail company less flexibility in terms of funding. He told the Guardian that instead of talking of a crisis in the railways, \u201c<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jul/16/hs2-chairman-sir-david-higgins-north-south-rail-divide\">people need to stop and identify that as a cause</a>\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/aug/17/goblin-lines-fate-could-be-electrifying\">Goblin line\u2019s fate could be electrifying | Letters</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Certainly, it focused the mind of ministers \u2013 and the Treasury \u2013 on money that was being spent. But it shouldn\u2019t exculpate Network Rail, which had been living it large on a credit card that has now racked up \u00a338bn of debt. Until the debt reclassification last September, a fantasy budget might not have been an insurmountable problem for Network Rail, as it could borrow at will and smooth over poor planning. Now, under Treasury scrutiny, the flexibility has gone. </p> <p>A third review, led by Nicola Shaw, the chief executive of HS1, which runs from London St Pancras to the Channel Tunnel, will have until next spring to examine the structures and financing of Network Rail. There has been talk of breaking up the business, which echoes Carne\u2019s own vision for creating eight distinct regional entities.

Since then, European markets have closed in negative territory. Germany\u2019s DAX is down 3.27% at 10,924 points; France\u2019s CAC40 has fallen 3.2% to 4,925 points; The FTSE100 is down 1.4% at 6,571 points; The Athens stock exchange is down 1.9% at 691 points. Tomorrow promises to be no less eventful, as European parliaments prepare to vote on Greece\u2019s latest bailout deal. We\u2019ll be tracking all the build-up to the votes. That\u2019s all for now. Thank you for following and commenting. Never mind scepticism in Germany about Greece\u2019s new bailout deal, there\u2019s plenty in Greece too, says Jon Henley in Athens, who draws my attention to this interesting article in Kathimerini. Commentator Alexis Papachelas writes that the new bailout deal will share the fate of those that came before, becoming an \u201corphan memorandum\u201d that will never be implemented. It will cause a storm of reactions, it will be voted on, and then it will remain for the most part a dead letter. When Tsipras openly rejects ownership of the memorandum, how are people expected to believe its implementation is a national goal? This deal will be simply voted through parliament so that Greece can pay back the ECB and the IMF ... [It] will fall through, or it may not even actually be put to work. It will remain an orphan memorandum, that will share the fate of those that went before it. No government has succeeded in building its own \u2018Greek\u2019 memorandum \u2013 a plan that could mobilise the state as well as the people. You can read the full article here Let\u2019s take a break from Greece to the look at the biggest deal of the day. As has been widely reported, the Economist Group has been sold by education publisher Pearson for \u00a3469m. John Foley of Breaking Views has been looking over the small-print and concludes the Economist have a lot of faith in their own self worth. According to Foley the company is valued at \u00a3957m, rather more than the group\u2019s in-house assessment of \u00a3730m. The company includes the Economist Intelligence Unit analysis unit, Washington-based newspaper Roll Call, as well as the eponymous magazine that likes to call itself a newspaper. As Foley writes: The price, like the magazine, is elite. It represents the group\u2019s EBITDA [earnings] for the year ending March 2015, where European media outlets trade on just over ten times, according to Thomson Reuters Eikon data. The Economist is profitable, but that profit isn\u2019t growing. The deal also means that the group will have to sell its brutalist HQ near St James\u2019s Park with fine panoramas over Westminster. Greek crisis-watchers can now put October in their diaries. In this month Greece\u2019s creditors will be checking on how well the government in Athens is implementing promised reforms. As one EU source tells Reuters: There will be a strong first review of the implementation of measures in October. Greece\u2019s eurozone creditors insist they not be discussing bailout relief before October, with no promises on how soon any easing of Greece\u2019s debt burden might come. Angela Merkel\u2019s returned from her holidays just in time..... ... via Reuters bureau chief for Germany. Greece\u2019s former finance minister Yanis Varoufakis doesn\u2019t have a lot in common with Germany\u2019s Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, but both are deeply sceptical about the Greek bailout deal. Speaking on the BBC\u2019s World at One, Varoufakis said the deal wouldn\u2019t work. He added that he had seen the \u201cfinance minister of Germany [Sch\u00e4uble] go to the Bundestag and effectively confess this deal is not going to work\u201d. Varoufakis was forced to resign last month and replaced by Euclid Tsakolotos. Speaking on Wednesday, he said: The International Monetary Fund... is throwing up its hands collectively despairing at a programme that is simply founded on unsustainable debt... and yet this is a programme that everybody is working towards implementing. Ask anyone who knows anything about Greece\u2019s finances and they will tell you this deal is not going to work. Varoufakis also reminisced with an old friend - Lord Lamont, who was Conservative chancellor when Britain was forced out of the Exchange Rate Mechanism in 1992, although Lamont has denied \u201csinging in his bathtub\u201d about the exit. First the deal, then the questions. The latest chapter of Greece\u2019s eurozone bailout drama does not depart from that script, with a report in Bild suggesting that the German government has little faith in what has been agreed in Athens. Germany\u2019s biggest-selling newspaper says that Berlin has three main concerns: Participation of the International Monetary Fund. As Die Zeit reported earlier Germany is anxious to keep the fund involved in the process and would like the EU to step in and offer to protect the IMF\u2019s losses. Greece\u2019s debt sustainability. Greece\u2019s financial needs were \u201chigher than expected\u201d according to a German government paper seen by Bild and debt sustainability remains an outstanding issue. Privatisation fund: how quickly can it get up and running? Not soon enough, according to the German government paper seen by Bild. The German government is also worried that the agreement does not include a clear timetable on Greece\u2019s reform and austerity programme. The response from the German finance ministry to the Bild story: No Comment. China\u2019s move to push its currency lower for the second day running has sent global stock markets tumbling. The central bank decision follows some weak factory output and retail sales figures, and had the desired effect of weakening the yuan. Perhaps too much, with reports the central bank intervened to sell dollars late on in the trading session to limit the falls in the Chinese currency. A press conference by the Peoples Bank of China tomorrow could provide some further clarity, but meanwhile US Federal Reserve member William Dudley said the devaluation had huge implications. Meanwhile Albert Edwards of Societe Generale warned of a\u201dtidal wave\u201d of deflation following the Chinese move. Elsewhere details of the Greek bailout agreement emerged, including a \u20ac25bn buffer for the country\u2019s banks and details of privatisations. A review of how well Greece is doing - assuming the deal goes ahead - could come as soon as October. Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras said he was optimistic about an agreement - it will be voted on in the Greek parliament on Thursday and examined by the Eurogroup of finance ministers on Friday. But he warned of people putting obstacles in the way, although he refrained from naming them. Germany said the offer of a bridging loan was still on the table, to give more time to iron out an agreement and still allow Greece to pay \u20ac3.2bn to the European Central Bank on 20 August. On the economic front Eurozone industrial production fell in July, while in the UK average earnings grew more slowly than expected while unemployment rose for the second month running. Wall Street has opened sharply lower, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average currently down 203 points or 1.18% in the wake of the uncertainty caused by China\u2019s further moves to weaken its currency. European markets remain sharply lower, with the FTSE 100 down 1.39%, Germany\u2019s Dax down 2.67% and France\u2019s Cac off 2.91%. EU sources have said negotiations on the \u20ac85bn bailout for Greece underwent a \u201csea change\u201d when former finance minister Yanis Varoufakis was out of the picture, Reuters reports. The agency said the mood changed when Varoufakis was replaced as finance minister by Euclid Tsakolotos. An EU source told Reuters: There was a sea change in the negotiations with the Greek authorities in recent weeks. The new Greek finance minister has an absolutely different attitude in the talks than the previous one. Talks were very constructive. (We await comment on this from Varoufakis...) US Federal Reserve member William Dudley said the events in China had huge implications. In a question and answer after a speech to the Rochester Business Alliance, he said it was too early to judge the impact of the yuan devaluation and said he would not comment on China\u2019s currency policy. But according to ForexLive he added: Everyone has gotten a bit frothy about China devaluing but you have once central bank cutting and it\u2019s economy slowing (China) and another whose economy is (supposedly) picking up and a central bank ready to hike (the US). That there would be some currency divergence is FX 101. And here\u2019s a link to the full memorandum: Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras said a deal with its lenders would end economic uncertainty in the country, but warned some people were trying to put obstacles in the way (now who could that be?). Reuters reports: \u201cDespite the obstacles that some are trying to put into our path, I\u2019m optimistic we will get to an agreement, loan support from the European mechanism, which will put a final end to economic uncertainty,\u201d Tsipras said during a visit to the Greek infrastructure ministry in Athens. It was the leftist leader\u2019s first comments after lenders and Greece reached a deal on Tuesday in a new bailout accord worth up to \u20ac86bn. He did not specify who was attempting to scupper the accord. Tsipras said his government would spearhead a fight against tax evasion and corruption, saying that was partly responsible for the crisis the country found itself in. Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba has disappointed investors with its first-quarter results, sending its US shares down 6% in premarket trading. The company\u2019s net income more than doubled to 12.34m yuan, while revenues rose 28% to 20.25m yuan ($3.27bn), compared to expectations of $3.32bn. Chinese steel producers have already cut export prices following the devaluation of the yuan, according to Reuters. Meanwhile Chinese cars sales fell by 6.6% in July following a 3.4% decline in June. But here\u2019s a hopeful sign: The Greek memorandum of understanding is a substantial result, says German government spokesman Steffen Seibert, but it is important that the International Monetary Fund is part of any bailout. And a German finance ministry spokesman said bridge financing for Greece - which would allow the country to make the payment it owes to the European Central Bank while a deal is hammered out - was not off the table (according to Reuters). But: That is a reference to a story earlier in Die Zeit. A major review of how Greece is implementing the reforms agreed for a third bailout will take place as soon as October, Reuters reports. (Assuming the \u20ac85bn deal goes ahead, of course). Any discussion of debt relief will come at a later stage, according to EU sources. Under the terms of the deal, Greek banks will receive \u20ac10bn of new capital immediately, with a further \u20ac15bn before the end of the year. The initial aid will be placed in a special account, says Reuters, and will be dependent on an approved business plan and the results of stress tests. The confusion over the Chinese actions is summed up by Connor Campbell at Spreadex: The yuan situation only got more complicated this Wednesday, with reports suggesting that the Chinese government, after devaluing its currency, was now propping it up by ordering its state banks to sell the dollar. If true it is an utterly baffling move, one that reflects a worryingly lack of clarity and/or sense in the decision making process at the top of the Chinese period, something that in itself that could have disastrous ramifications down the road. One of the repercussions of the turmoil caused by China\u2019s currency move is that investors are looking for havens such as German bonds. So the yield on German two year bond yields has hit a record low, edging down below -0.29% (yes, that\u2019s a negative rate). Perhaps we\u2019ll get some clarity on China\u2019s thinking tomorrow - the Peoples Bank of China is reportedly holding a press conference, according to Bloomberg. The Chinese devaluation could unleash a \u201ctidal wave\u201d of deflation, according to Albert Edwards at Societe Generale. He writes: Renminbi devaluation has been one of my big non-consensus calls of the past few years. I can tell you that 18 months ago, when it was becoming increasingly clear that this was the end game in the currency war and I articulated this view in meetings to clients, I would get so much pushback I was almost jet-propelled out of the door. Anyway, now the die has been cast, what next? This is only just the beginning. Investors should prepare for a tidal wave of deflation from Asia... Make no mistake, this is the start of something big, something ugly. For while the west has been heaving a sigh of relief over the past few months that deflation pressures have abated somewhat \u2013 especially at the core level \u2013 we have been emphasising that deflation has only been intensifying in Asia and that like any pus-filled boil, this deflationary pressure would soon need to be lanced. We have long believed that we are only one misstep from outright deflation in the west with core inflation in both the US and eurozone at just 1%. We expect the acceleration of emerging market devaluations to send waves of deflation to the west to overwhelm already struggling corporate profitability and take us back into outright recession. As investors realise yet another recession beckons, without any normalisation of either interest rates or fiscal imbalances in this cycle, expect a financial market rout every bit as large as 2008... The key thing here is that Tuesday\u2019s devaluation is not just a one-off \u2013 you will see persistent weakness from hereon in. For although the Peoples Bank of China said the move was a one-time adjustment to reflect changes in the way it calculates the daily fix, it also said that the price would be set \u201cin conjunction with demand and supply conditions in the foreign exchange market and exchange rate movements of the major currencies\u201d. To all but the most PollyAnna\u2019ish of observers that means this is the start of a major renminbi devaluation because of the massive downward market pressure the currency is under via the balance of payments deficit. Meanwhile the Wall Street Journal is also hearing that China is moving to halt the yuan slide: More from the Greek memorandum of understanding, courtesy Reuters: The memo calls for \u201cirreversible steps\u201d to sell its regional airports, privatise the electricity transmission company by October 2015 unless an alternative scheme with equivalent results is presented, and announce binding bid dates for the sale of Piraeus and Thessalonika ports by the end of October. The timing of any vote in the Greek parliament on the bailout terms is uncertain, reports AP Financial, thanks to an intervention by speaker Zoe Konstantopoulou, an opponent of the bailout. The agency says: Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras called an emergency session of parliament, asking the assembly\u2019s speaker for the bill to go through committee level Wednesday, ahead of a full debate and vote by the end of Thursday. However, the exact timings remain unclear. Parliament Speaker Zoe Konstantopoulou, a dissenter within Tsipras\u2019 left-wing Syriza party and vociferous bailout opponent, reportedly scheduled the parliamentary procedure to start only Wednesday night. That would delay the process and meaning a vote would likely be held in the pre-dawn hours of Friday. More confusion over China\u2019s actions, following earlier reports Chinese state-owned banks had been selling dollars. Eurozone industrial output fell by more than expected in June, following declines in activity in Germany, France and Italy. Output dropped by 0.4% month-on-month in June compared to expectations of a 0.2% dip. But it was still 1.2% higher year on year. Germany is looking at whether the European Union could provide guarantees to the International Monetary Fund about Greek debt, in order to keep the fund as part of the bailout process and avoid the need for major debt relief, Reuters is reporting citing German newspaper Die Zeit. The paper said the idea meant \u201cif Greece ran out of money, the Europeans would jump in and the IMF would suffer no losses. In return the fund would no longer demand extensive debt relief.\u201d Meanwhile Reuters says the draft memorandum of understanding for Greece sees a buffer of up to \u20ac25bn to recapitalise viable banks and resolve costs of non-viable banks. The memo expects privatisation proceeds, excluding bank shares, of \u20ac1.4bn in 2015, \u20ac3.7bn in 2016 and \u20ac1.3bn in 2017. Standard and Poor\u2019s agrees the China move is not the start of a currency war. In a new report the ratings agency says: China\u2019s surprise move to allow for more exchange rate flexibility makes good economic sense and is not the start of a currency war or an attempt to jump-start growth....The move is more likely to be due to a relatively benign \u201ctechnical correction\u201d aimed at improving market functioning or an effort to comply with IMF conditions to get the yuan included in the special drawing rights (SDR) basket sooner rather than later. \u201cThe argument that China is trying to spur growth by weakening its currency to spur exports does not strike us as very convincing,\u201d said Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s chief economist for Asia-Pacific Paul Gruenwald. \u201cExports are more a function of foreign demand, with the exchange rate playing a secondary role. There is no reason for that relationship to have changed.\u201d Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s doubts that the move was driven by weak July trade data since these have been soft for some time--the trade surplus has been trending at a high level. \u201cWe see the timing as opportune. This is because China can now say that by moving to a more market-determined rate it is delivering what the IMF and US Treasury have been asking for. And since the pressure is now on the yuan to weaken, having more exchange rate flexibility is palatable to the Chinese authorities,\u201d said Mr. Gruenwald. Back with China, and the country could be seeking a devaluation of the yuan of up to 10%, writes Fergus Ryan in Beijing: China\u2019s central bank is under pressure to further weaken the yuan in a bid for aid the country\u2019s struggling exporters, Reuters reports. Citing sources involved in the policy making process, the report claims that \u201cpowerful voices inside the government\u201d are pushing for the yuan to devalue even further. According to the news agency, the comments suggest there is pressure inside government circles for an overall devaluation of almost 10%. The UK jobs data still suggests a rate rise in February, according to James Knightley at ING Bank: The UK jobs report is pretty close to expectations with some softish headlines. It is likely that the election timing has played its part given these are three month rolling numbers so the uncertainty generated by the politics in April/May \u2013 whether it would be a Labour-SNP coalition government for example \u2013 led to firms being less keen to hire workers and invest aggressively. In terms of the headline numbers. Employment fell 63,000 versus expectations of a 55,000 drop with the three month rolling average for the unemployment rate remaining at 5.6%. Pay rates excluding bonuses remained at 2.8% year on year in the three months to June while including bonuses they slipped to 2.4% from 2.8%. We are expecting better numbers in coming months as the election effects fade and the underlying strength of the UK economy continues to push employment and pay higher. If we look deeper into the tables at individual monthly data we see than the unemployment rate for June fell to 5.5% from 5.8% in May while private sector pay recorded the fourth consecutive annual increase in excess of 3% (public sector pay is being restrained by government spending limits to 1.3% year on year). Consequently, we expect medium term domestically generated inflation pressures to continue to rise, but in the near term CPI will remain depressed by falling energy prices and sterling strength. As a result we still favour a February date for the first Bank of England rate rise. UK average earnings growth was lower than expected in July, while the unemployment rate held steady at 5.6% but jobless numbers rose. Weekly wages grew 2.4% year on year in the three months to June compared to 3.2% in the three months to May and forecasts of 2.8%. The unemployment rate of 5.6% was in line with expectations, while the number of people out of work rose 25,000 quarter on quarter to 1.852m, the second monthly rise in a row. Sterling has hit a one month low against the euro following the wage data. Here\u2019s something to put the Chinese economy in context as regards the UK: Some talk of a cut in China\u2019s reserve requirement ratio: Here\u2019s the performance of the Shanghai composite this year: Meanwhile the global stock market sell-off is accelerating. The FTSE 100 is now down 1.86% or 124 points. Germany\u2019s Dax is down 1.95%, France\u2019s Cac has fallen 1.7% and Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB is down 2.33%. In Greece the Athens market - which bucked Tuesday\u2019s downward trend with a 2.1% rise - is now down 0.38%. In China the Shanghai composite lost 1.03%, while the Nikkei fell 1.58% or 327.98 points. As for the US, ADS Securities is forecasting the Dow Jones Industrial Average will open down around 173 and the S&amp;P down 21 points. The International Monetary Fund has welcomed China\u2019s move towards greater exchange rate flexibility, suggesting it was a helpful step towards the yuan being included in its currency basket. An IMF spokesperson said: The new mechanism for determining the central parity of the Renminbi announced by the PBC appears a welcome step as it should allow market forces to have a greater role in determining the exchange rate. The exact impact will depend on how the new mechanism is implemented in practice. Greater exchange rate flexibility is important for China as it strives to give market-forces a decisive role in the economy and is rapidly integrating into global financial markets. We believe that China can, and should, aim to achieve an effectively floating exchange rate system within two to three years. Regarding the ongoing review of the IMF\u2019s SDR [special drawing rights] basket, the announced change has no direct implications for the criteria used in determining the composition of the basket. Nevertheless, a more market-determined exchange rate would facilitate SDR operations in case the Renminbi were included in the currency basket going forward. The proposed Greek bailout deal may yet run into problems with Germany, reports Jon Henley in Athens: An early note of caution following yesterday\u2019s optimism around a new \u20ac85bn bailout deal between Greece and its creditors \u2013 the country\u2019s third financial rescue in five years.Ekathimerini is reporting that the punishing reforms-for-aid package, which the Greek parliament has been recalled from its summer recess to ratify on Thursday, may yet run into opposition from Germany at a planned summit of eurozone finance ministers on Friday. \u201cThe Greek government\u2019s greatest concern is that German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble will reiterate his opposition to a deal and insist Greece should instead be granted a bridging loan\u201d to allow it to meet its \u20ac3.2bn euro debt payment to the ECB on August 20, the paper said, citing government sources. It added that the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, had made similar noises on Tuesday in a conversation with Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras, saying Germany was \u201csceptical\u201d about the agreement and proposed a bridging loan instead of a full agreement, which she suggested required \u201cmore detailed discussion\u201d. The AFP news agency also quoted an EU source as saying it was still not certain the deal would be finalised by August 20 - meaning Athens might need emergency funding to pay its ECB debt. \u201cWe might need a few days\u2019 bridge (funding),\u201d the source told AFP. \u201cIn that case, we need all the member states\u201d to approve the loan. More on Greece: Up until now it had seemed highly probable that the US Federal Reserve would lift interest rates in September, judging by recent data and comments from the central bank\u2019s members. But could the Chinese devaluation change that? M&amp;G\u2019s retail bond team say the chances are receding: As forecast the latest Chinese moves to devalue its currency have sent European markets lower. The FTSE 100 is down 71 points or just over 1%, with commodity companies under particular pressure. Fears of a slowdown in China - a key consumer of commodities - have pushed the likes of Glencore, Rio Tinto and BNP Billiton down around 3% after hefty falls on Tuesday. Germany\u2019s Dax has dropped 1.3%, Spain\u2019s Ibex is 1% lower and Italy\u2019s Ibex is off 0.7%. One of the problems with the Greek economy which needs to be tackled as part of its reforms is the issue of tax evasion. But this is no simple matter according to the government. Greek newspaper Kathimerini reports: Alternate Finance Minister Tryfon Alexiadis has described the issue of tax evasion in Greece as complex in an interview with the Belgian newspaper L\u2019Echo, while stressing that he will be judged on his ability to collect taxes. Asked why collecting taxes seems so hard in Greece, Alexiadis pointed to a lack of political will to ensure a working system and interventions by politicians and others. He noted, however, that during the last 5,300 tax inspections he had not received any calls for intervention, showing a public awareness that this government\u2019s higher officials are very different. After five years of tax rises, Alexiadis noted that the situation is tense. Last week tax collectors on Rhodes were roughed up by business owners and citizens while conducting spot checks. \u201cThese reactions are the start of fascism,\u201d he said. \u201cCitizens cannot attack officials for doing their job.\u201d He added that Greece has one tax inspector for every 1,100 inhabitants, much lower than other European countries, out-of-date computers and no access to X-ray machines such as in Albania, Bulgaria and Romania, greatly reducing the effectiveness of controls. Back with China, and the central bank moves seem to be having the desired effect, with the yuan at a four year low against the dollar: But Capital Economics says - despite much talk of it - that China is not declaring a currency war but is more about financial reform. Angus Campbell, senior analyst at FX Pro said: The renminbi has been one of the most highly controlled currencies in foreign exchange and had a quasi-peg against the dollar for some time, but just as we saw from the Swiss National Bank earlier in the year, when economic conditions shift, action has to be taken to adjust the value of a currency to take it to a fairer value. Such moves are usually in the interest of your own domestic economy and since China has been slowing rapidly for years against the backdrop of a slower global economy, it\u2019s little wonder the data has been disappointing and the PBOC has been upping the ante on the monetary stimulus front. These fundamentals would cause any free floating currency to fall in value, so it should not come as a surprise to see the devaluation occurring and further weakness could follow as China attempts to give provide its exporters with a more competitive environment. This move is impacting risk assets due to the unpredictability of the PBOC\u2019s action and as it will have a knock on deflationary impact for China\u2019s big trading partners. The FTSE 100 is due to open lower by some 50 points and at the time of writing the Dow Jones is being called to open over 100 points in the red as companies that are reliant on revenues from China will be shunned by investors for the second day in a row. In the UK there are unemployment and average earnings figures due later. Economics editor Larry Elliott says: Fresh jobs and wages data for the UK will be closely scrutinised by the Bank of England and the City for evidence that the surprise jump in unemployment reported last month was a blip. With the economy growing strongly in the second quarter, the latest figures for the labour market are expected to show a modest improvement in employment and annual earnings growth running close to 3%. His full preview is here: Michael Hewson at CMC Markets said: The unemployment rate is expected to stay at 5.6%, while the increase in average earnings of 3.2% that we saw in May is expected to moderate slightly to 2.8%, still well above the headline and core rates of CPI inflation. Elsewhere today, Greek parliamentary committees are due to discuss the proposed third bailout deal which will give the beleaguered country access to around \u20ac85bn of new funds, ahead of a 20 August deadline to make a \u20ac3.2bn payment to the European Central Bank. Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras wants lawmakers to examine the proposals, with a view to a vote in parliament on Thursday. The eurogroup of finance ministers is set to consider the proposals on Friday. Here are IG\u2019s opening calls for European markets: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. A day after the Chinese authorities surprised markets by devaluing the country\u2019s currency, the People\u2019s Bank of China lowered its guidance rate for the yuan by 1.6% compared to the previous close. The move reinforced fears about the country\u2019s slowing economy, and sparked further fears of a currency war. And new data showed why the country\u2019s authorities are trying to drive down the currency to boost its flagging economy. Factory output rose 6% in July, a three month low and below expectations of 6.6% growth. Fixed-asset investment rose 11.2% in the first seven months of the year, comparred to forecasts of 11.5%. Meanwhile retail sales grew 10.5% year on year in July, which was down from the 10.6% growth seen in June. Economist Louis Kuus at RBS Hong Kong told Reuters: The output number is bad. This kind of data will only accentuate the negative outlook that everyone has about the economy. Many people were expecting an improvement and there is no improvement. In retrospect they probably saw this data before yesterday\u2019s devaluation. I\u2019m not suggesting the data triggered yesterday\u2019s move but it could have been a factor. According to Reuters, Chinese state-owned banks have been sellling dollars on behalf of the central bank to keep the yuan at around 6.43 to the US currency. The Chinese moves sent global markets lower yesterday, with commodity companies in particular falling sharply on worries about the outlook for the world\u2019s second largest economy, a key consumer of metals and oil. The Nikkei is currently down another 1.58%.",

As investors realise yet another recession beckons, without any normalisation of either interest rates or fiscal imbalances in this cycle, expect a financial market rout every bit as large as 2008... </p> <p>The key thing here is that Tuesday\u2019s devaluation is not just a one-off \u2013 you will see persistent weakness from hereon in. For although the Peoples Bank of China said the move was a one-time adjustment to reflect changes in the way it calculates the daily fix, it also said that the price would be set \u201cin conjunction with demand and supply conditions in the foreign exchange market and exchange rate movements of the major currencies\u201d.

There is no reason for that relationship to have changed.\u201d</p> <p>Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s doubts that the move was driven by weak July trade data since these have been soft for some time--the trade surplus has been trending at a high level.</p> <p>\u201cWe see the timing as opportune.

Employment fell 63,000 versus expectations of a 55,000 drop with the three month rolling average for the unemployment rate remaining at 5.6%. Pay rates excluding bonuses remained at 2.8% year on year in the three months to June while including bonuses they slipped to 2.4% from 2.8%.<br></p> <p>We are expecting better numbers in coming months as the election effects fade and the underlying strength of the UK economy continues to push employment and pay higher.<br></p> <p>If we look deeper into the tables at individual monthly data we see than the unemployment rate for June fell to 5.5% from 5.8% in May while private sector pay recorded the fourth consecutive annual increase in excess of 3% (public sector pay is being restrained by government spending limits to 1.3% year on year). Consequently, we expect medium term domestically generated inflation pressures to continue to rise, but in the near term CPI will remain depressed by falling energy prices and sterling strength. As a result we still favour a February date for the first Bank of England rate rise.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3c83a664f844d0b9d9d1b661c0b2c5d3eaee5fb4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3c83a664f844d0b9d9d1b661c0b2c5d3eaee5fb4/0_277_4256_2554/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Election uncertainty hits employement numbers.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Election uncertainty hits employement numbers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-55cb06bae4b0891b23e59e0f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-08-12T08:42:01.855Z\">9.42am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ONS/statuses/631383495387049984\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">For Apr-Jun 2015 wages up 2.4% on a year earlier including bonuses, &amp; 2.8% excluding bonuses <a href=\"http://t.co/AMrsZwZOa5\">http://t.co/AMrsZwZOa5</a> <a href=\"http://t.co/glS7hFO3g3\">pic.twitter.com/glS7hFO3g3</a></p>&mdash; ONS (@ONS) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ONS/status/631383495387049984\">August 12, 2015</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ONS/statuses/631382370722152448\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Unemployment?src=hash\">#Unemployment</a> rate 5.6% Apr-Jun 2015, up slightly on Jan-Mar, down from 6.3% year earlier <a href=\"http://t.co/B0H6zORFTm\">http://t.co/B0H6zORFTm</a> <a href=\"http://t.co/PUUB4a4Xke\">pic.twitter.com/PUUB4a4Xke</a></p>&mdash; ONS (@ONS) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ONS/status/631382370722152448\">August 12, 2015</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-55cb0495e4b0891b23e59e0a\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-08-12T08:38:37.429Z\">9.38am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">UK wage growth slows, unemployment rises for second month in a row</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>UK average earnings growth was lower than expected in July, while the unemployment rate held steady at 5.6% but jobless numbers rose.</p> <p>Weekly wages grew 2.4% year on year in the three months to June compared to 3.2% in the three months to May and forecasts of 2.8%.</p> <p>The unemployment rate of 5.6% was in line with expectations, while the number of people out of work rose 25,000 quarter on quarter to 1.852m, the second monthly rise in a row.</p> <p>Sterling has hit a one month low against the euro following the wage data.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2015-08-12T08:46:24.890Z\">at 9.46am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-55cb0217e4b0319c7e457307\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-08-12T08:22:33.869Z\">9.22am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here\u2019s something to put the Chinese economy in context as regards the UK:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/EdConwaySky/statuses/631379011822718976\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">NB China is still only the UK&#39;s 6th biggest export destination.

An IMF spokesperson said: </p> <blockquote> <p>The new mechanism for determining the central parity of the Renminbi announced by the PBC appears a welcome step as it should allow market forces to have a greater role in determining the exchange rate. The exact impact will depend on how the new mechanism is implemented in practice.</p> <p>Greater exchange rate flexibility is important for China as it strives to give market-forces a decisive role in the economy and is rapidly integrating into global financial markets. We believe that China can, and should, aim to achieve an effectively floating exchange rate system within two to three years. Regarding the ongoing review of the IMF\u2019s SDR [special drawing rights] basket, the announced change has no direct implications for the criteria used in determining the composition of the basket. Nevertheless, a more market-determined exchange rate would facilitate SDR operations in case the Renminbi were included in the currency basket going forward.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-55caf654e4b0319c7e4572f0\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/jonhenley\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-08-12T07:35:56.753Z\">8.35am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Merkel &quot;sceptical&quot; about Greek bailout deal</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The proposed Greek bailout deal may yet run into problems with Germany, reports Jon Henley in Athens:</p> <blockquote> <p>An early note of caution following yesterday\u2019s optimism around a new \u20ac85bn bailout deal between Greece and its creditors \u2013 the country\u2019s third financial rescue in five years.<a href=\"http://www.ekathimerini.com/200481/article/ekathimerini/news/deal-to-go-to-parliament-after-creditors-approval\">Ekathimerini is reporting</a> that the punishing reforms-for-aid package, which the Greek parliament has been recalled from its summer recess to ratify on Thursday, may yet run into opposition from Germany at a planned summit of eurozone finance ministers on Friday. </p> <p>\u201cThe Greek government\u2019s greatest concern is that German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble will reiterate his opposition to a deal and insist Greece should instead be granted a bridging loan\u201d to allow it to meet its \u20ac3.2bn euro debt payment to the ECB on August 20, the paper said, citing government sources.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"261cda3f56af0fb9f0d9d2a0b4f0e313d35f6d43\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/261cda3f56af0fb9f0d9d2a0b4f0e313d35f6d43/0_0_2962_1778/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tsipras and Merkel\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tsipras and Merkel</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stephanie Pilick/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <blockquote> <p>It added that the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, had made similar noises on Tuesday in a conversation with Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras, saying Germany was \u201csceptical\u201d about the agreement and proposed a bridging loan instead of a full agreement, which she suggested required \u201cmore detailed discussion\u201d.

The black T-shirt printed with the slogan \u201cJe suis over it\u201d was spotted by shopper Tom Young at a branch in Cribbs Causeway, Bristol. Young said the slogan was in bad taste as it could be seen as referring to \u201cJe suis Charlie\u201d, which was a mark of solidarity and defiance in the aftermath of the Paris terror attack. Twelve people, including eight journalists, were killed when gunmen stormed the office of the satirical magazine in January.

The T-shirt was manufactured by the US-based Reason Clothing in May 2014, before the Charlie Hebdo massacre. A spokesperson for Reason said the company was working with retailers to remove the style from stocks and have them destroyed. \u201cNo connection with the Charlie Hebdo attacks was intended or implied,\u201d the spokesperson added. The T-shirt has also been removed from sale on the fashion website Asos. A spokesperson said: \u201cIt is never our intention to knowingly offend or cause upset to anyone, least of all those affected by the terrible tragedy in Paris in January 2015 this year. \u201cTherefore we have withdrawn the item in question from sale with immediate effect and fully support the brand\u2019s pledge to destroy all remaining stock.\u201d A spokesperson from TK Maxx told the Mirror: \u201cWe take product matters very seriously and appreciate that this T-shirt has been brought to our attention. \u201cAs soon as we became aware of the offensive T-shirt message, we initiated the process to remove this item from our stores and are internally reviewing how we inadvertently purchased the item.

      "bodyText": "\u201cMake no mistake, this is the start of something big, something ugly.\u201d City economist Albert Edwards rarely minces his words, but his reaction to China\u2019s devaluation, which sent shockwaves through global markets, underlined how powerfully Beijing\u2019s move may be felt thousands of miles away. Edwards, of the bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, argues that as well as creating a challenge for China\u2019s Asian rivals, by making its exports more competitive, a cheaper yuan will send \u201ca tidal wave of deflation\u201d breaking over the world economy. Central banks in the US and the UK have primed investors for interest rate rises, with the Bank of England Mark Carney pointing to the turn of the year for a move, and Janet Yellen, at the Federal Reserve, signalling that a tightening could start as soon as September. Edwards argues that instead of pushing up rates, central banks in the west should be preparing themselves to ward off a deflationary slump. In the period running up to the financial crisis of 2008, which became known as the \u201cGreat Moderation\u201d, inflation in the west was kept under control by the influx of cheap commodities and consumer goods from China and other low-wage economies. Economies including the UK and the US were able to expand more rapidly than they otherwise might have done, without generating a surge in inflation. But today, with inflation already close to zero \u2013 indeed at zero in the UK \u2013 China\u2019s decision to devalue could bring a fresh wave of price weakness to the west. Cheap goods are great news when economic demand is relatively strong; but economists fret about falling prices because entrenched deflation can prompt businesses and consumers to postpone spending \u2013 hoping prices have farther to fall \u2013 and blunt policymakers\u2019 standard tool of interest rate cuts. Erik Britton, of City consultancy Fathom, said: \u201cWe\u2019re all going to feel it: we\u2019ll feel it through commodities; we\u2019ll feel it through manufactured goods exports, not just from China but from everywhere that has to compete with it; and we\u2019ll feel it through wages.\u201d At the very least, analysts believe China\u2019s move could persuade monetary policymakers to stay their hand. \u201cIf there\u2019s deflation in the system, is the Fed going to be tightening? The answer is, no,\u201d said Simon Derrick, of BNY Mellon. Britton believes Carney\u2019s strong hints that a rate rise is on the way could also prove premature. \u201cIn the UK, you\u2019re not going to see tightening any time soon.\u201d Where economic demand is already fragile \u2013 in the eurozone, for example \u2013 the effects of deflation are likely to be felt more strongly. Fathom believes China could be willing to let the yuan depreciate by as much as 25% over the next five years \u2013 \u201cstone by stone, step by step\u201d \u2013 in an attempt to restore the export-led growth that was such a winning formula in the decade running up to the global financial crisis. How much more Beijing is willing to go is likely to depend partly on its motivations. There are at least three theories. The first, and most benign, is that the People\u2019s Bank of China is keen to show the yuan is a truly free-floating currency, in order to win inclusion in the basket used by the International Monetary Fund to determine the value of member-countries\u2019 Special Drawing Rights \u2013 in effect the IMF\u2019s internal currency. A decision about composition of the SDR is expected in September next year. Putting the IMF\u2019s imprimatur on the yuan in this way could start to open the way for its use as a global reserve currency, and this latest move could be seen as a way of winning the approval of the Washington-based lender. But a jarring move could infuriate the Americans, who have the whip-hand at the IMF, so if this is the primary motivation, it might suggest Beijing will proceed with caution. Second, and slightly less reassuring, is the idea that China is trying to buy itself a bit of insurance against a coming Fed rate rise. Pegging the Chinese currency against the dollar has become increasingly costly, with the dollar up as much as 21% against other global currencies since spring of last year, and although China\u2019s foreign exchange reserves remain vast, the central bank has been forced to dip into them to support the currency. Simon Evenett, a trade expert at the University of St Gallen in Switzerland, believes China is trying to protect itself against the period of financial instability that can follow monetary tightening, by pre-emptively weakening the link between the yuan and the greenback. \u201cPlenty of studies have shown that rising interest rates in Washington have precipitated crises in emerging markets, whose knock-on effects can\u2019t be reliably predicted. Preservation of options may provide the best account for Tuesday\u2019s steps by the People\u2019s Bank of China,\u201d said Evenett. But third, and perhaps most alarming, is the argument that China has resorted to devaluing its currency in a desperate attempt to stabilise economic growth, as other levers have failed. Chinese policymakers have been engaged in a gargantuan effort to switch their export-dependent economy, reliant on volatile international demand, to another engine: consumer spending at home. At the same time, they are battling to bring more competition and free market approaches to stodgy state industries; and to tackle the legacy of an unsustainable borrowing binge, including bubbles in the property and stock markets. These would be a formidable set of challenges for any political leaders, and while the state of the Chinese economy is hard to assess, a number of warning signs have been flashing, including a share price plunge on a scale reminiscent of the US\u2019s 1929 Wall Street crash and most recently, an 8.3% drop in exports in July. Official figures show GDP growth in line with Beijing\u2019s 7% target; but Fathom\u2019s analysts, who study other measures, such as electricity usage and freight volumes, say it appears to be closer to 4%. Britton describes the depreciation as \u201cChina, doubling-down on its bet,\u201d and warned: \u201cIf we are right about the hardness of the landing they\u2019re facing, you ain\u2019t seen nothing yet.\u201d Adam Posen, of the Peterson Institute of International Economics in Washington, says China\u2019s motivation may only become clear over time, but markets will be asking themselves \u201cis depreciation a side-effect of liberalisation or is liberalisation cover for devaluation?\u201d But whatever the reasons behind it, Beijing\u2019s economic gear shift will have far-reaching effects. Not everyone is as apocalyptic as Edwards; but he believes the new wave of deflation emanating from China could \u201coverwhelm already struggling corporate profitability and take us back into outright recession\u201d. \u201cAs investors realise yet another recession beckons, without any normalisation of either interest rates or fiscal imbalances in this cycle, expect a financial market rout every bit as large as 2008.\u201d",

There are at least three theories.</p> <p>The first, and most benign, is that the People\u2019s Bank of China is keen to show the yuan is a truly free-floating currency, in order to win inclusion in the basket used by the International Monetary Fund to determine the value of member-countries\u2019 Special Drawing Rights \u2013 in effect the IMF\u2019s internal currency.</p> <p>A decision about composition of the SDR is expected in September next year. Putting the IMF\u2019s imprimatur on the yuan in this way could start to open the way for its use as a global reserve currency, and this latest move could be seen as a way of winning the approval of the Washington-based lender.<br></p> <p>But a jarring move could infuriate the Americans, who have the whip-hand at the IMF, so if this is the primary motivation, it might suggest Beijing will proceed with caution.</p> <p>Second, and slightly less reassuring, is the idea that China is trying to buy itself a bit of insurance against a coming Fed rate rise. </p> <p>Pegging the Chinese currency against the dollar has become increasingly costly, with the dollar up as much as 21% against other global currencies since spring of last year, and although China\u2019s foreign exchange reserves remain vast, the central bank has been forced to dip into them to support the currency.</p> <p>Simon Evenett, a trade expert at the University of St Gallen in Switzerland, believes China is trying to protect itself against the period of financial instability that can follow monetary tightening, by pre-emptively weakening the link between the yuan and the greenback.</p> <p>\u201cPlenty of studies have shown that rising interest rates in Washington have precipitated crises in emerging markets, whose knock-on effects can\u2019t be reliably predicted. Preservation of options may provide the best account for Tuesday\u2019s steps by the People\u2019s Bank of China,\u201d said Evenett.</p> <p>But third, and perhaps most alarming, is the argument that China has resorted to devaluing its currency in a desperate attempt to stabilise economic growth, as other levers have failed.</p> <p>Chinese policymakers have been engaged in a gargantuan effort to switch their export-dependent economy, reliant on volatile international demand, to another engine: consumer spending at home.</p> <p>At the same time, they are battling to bring more competition and free market approaches to stodgy state industries; and to tackle the legacy of an unsustainable borrowing binge, including bubbles in the property and stock markets.</p> <p>These would be a formidable set of challenges for any political leaders, and while the state of the Chinese economy is hard to assess, a number of warning signs have been flashing, including a share price plunge on a scale reminiscent of the US\u2019s 1929 Wall Street crash and most recently, an 8.3% drop in exports in July.</p> <p>Official figures show GDP growth in line with Beijing\u2019s 7% target; but Fathom\u2019s analysts, who study other measures, such as electricity usage and freight volumes, say it appears to be closer to 4%. Britton describes the depreciation as \u201cChina, doubling-down on its bet,\u201d and warned: \u201cIf we are right about the hardness of the landing they\u2019re facing, you ain\u2019t seen nothing yet.\u201d</p> <p>Adam Posen, of the Peterson Institute of International Economics in Washington, says China\u2019s motivation may only become clear over time, but markets will be asking themselves \u201cis depreciation a side-effect of liberalisation or is liberalisation cover for devaluation?\u201d</p> <p>But whatever the reasons behind it, Beijing\u2019s economic gear shift will have far-reaching effects. Not everyone is as apocalyptic as Edwards; but he believes the new wave of deflation emanating from China could \u201coverwhelm already struggling corporate profitability and take us back into outright recession\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cAs investors realise yet another recession beckons, without any normalisation of either interest rates or fiscal imbalances in this cycle, expect a financial market rout every bit as large as 2008.\u201d<br></p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Boots and Dixons are to issue new guidance to airport staff about checking customers\u2019 boarding passes following a consumer revolt over \u201crip-off\u201d VAT charges. Customers of Boots and Dixons and other prominent stores including WH Smith pledged not to show their boarding passes at airports after it emerged that retailers were benefiting from VAT savings without lowering prices. Attacking the practice as a \u201cfraud\u201d and a \u201ccon\u201d, customers said they felt they were obliged to hand over their boarding cards at checkouts for security reasons or because they were getting a discount. However, it has emerged that the information is used by stores to avoid paying 20% VAT on everything they sell to customers who are travelling outside the EU. Many stores, including Boots and WH Smith, do not pass this saving to consumers. Amid growing revolt on Wednesday, Dixons said it had reminded its staff that customers are not obliged to hand over their boarding card at checkouts. A Dixons spokeswoman said: \u201cAt Dixons Travel we do ask customers to show their boarding pass when making a purchase, but this is only on request and is not mandatory. We have re-issued existing guidance to all our colleagues confirming this as our clear process.\u201d A Boots spokeswoman said: \u201cAt Boots we always listen to our customers and to help remove any confusion at this time, we have taken the decision to no longer ask customers to show us their boarding passes while we undertake a longer term review of this situation. We are currently in the process of notifying our airport store colleagues of this change.\u201d The revolt comes after Treasury minister David Gauke said some retailers were not passing on savings to customers. Speaking to the Independent, he said: \u201cThe VAT relief at airports is intended to reduce prices for travellers, not as a windfall gain for shops. \u201cWhile many retailers do pass this saving on to customers, it is disappointing that some are choosing not to. We urge all airside retailers to use this relief for the benefit of their customers.\u201d The shadow culture secretary, Chris Bryant, was among those on Twitter saying he would refuse to show his boarding pass at airport stores. At Heathrow on Wednesday, passenger Owen Evans blamed the government for not preventing retailers from taking advantage of the loophole. \u201cIt should be made illegal,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the shops are playing the system, it\u2019s the government\u2019s fault for allowing them to do that. Anyone would do that if it\u2019s legal. Obviously you want to do the best for your business. But obviously it\u2019s not providing the best service for your customers.\u201d On Facebook, the retailers faced a storm of criticism from angry customers. Ian McNaughton demanded to be told when Boots would repay the government the VAT it had \u201cessentially extorted\u201d from customers flying outside the EU. \u201cHaving purchased from Boots many times when flying abroad I\u2019ve unwittingly been implicated in what in effect is fraudulent activity which I\u2019m annoyed about now!\u201d he said. \u201cYour behaviour and that of other airport retailers regarding this VAT issue is abhorrent and reflects major retailers contempt for their customers! I will not be buying anything from Boots again if I can until you change policy regarding this issue of VAT \u2018fraud\u2019 and make the necessary amends and would urge other customers to do likewise!!\u201d Another customer, Connie Tindale, asked Boots why \u201cyour staff at Gatwick are so aggressive when they ask for boarding passes\u201d. A Boots representative replied that they were \u201cconcerned to hear about the Gatwick stores and will ensure this is fed back to them\u201d. At Heathrow, Jonathan Stanton, head of digital retail at Nintendo and a regular traveller, said he wanted the VAT he had paid in duty-free shops to be refunded. He said he felt cheated. \u201cIt\u2019s unfair if they pocket the money,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s basically the VAT that we pay and they are pocketing it. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make any difference to me today, but I have just come back from LA and I\u2019m going to New York in a few weeks. I would probably like them to give me the VAT back at the point of purchase.\u201d Of the boarding card checks, he added: \u201cI thought it was just a security requirement. It was never explained to me at the time.\u201d A spokeswoman for Boots said customers were asked \u2013 not forced \u2013 to show boarding cards at airports. She said: \u201cIt is not compulsory to ask for [boarding cards] so if someone doesn\u2019t want to show it we won\u2019t force it.\u201d In a statement the company said information on boarding passes was used to ensure accurate accounting. It said: \u201cOur airport store teams are asked to request and scan boarding cards to ensure the accuracy of our accounting records, which includes the accurate reporting of VAT. We request our customers\u2019 boarding cards so that our VAT accounting is in line with the HMRC\u2019s requirements. It added: \u201cThe HMRC and airports accept that this is general practice for all retailers located within airport terminals. Our pricing in airport stores is consistent with our London prices and VAT is not taken into account when setting prices of products. Showing a boarding card is not a compulsory requirement and any of our customers that do not wish to share this information can shop with us without the boarding card being scanned.\u201d A former WH Smith employee at Manchester airport, who did not wish to be named, told the Guardian that store staff were told to check boarding passes as part of an unexplained \u201csurvey\u201d. WH Smith confirmed that staff in its airport stores requested customers to show boarding passes, but conceded \u201cthere is no obligation on the part of the customer\u201d to do so. It added that dual pricing would be impossible to implement even though many duty-free shops already display two prices \u2013 one if you are flying in the EU and a lower price if you are flying outside the EU. It said: \u201cWhilst much of what we sell, eg newspapers, magazines and books, is fixed price and does not attract VAT, any VAT relief associated with the identification of customers travelling outside of the EU is reported in accordance with UK legislation, and any relief obtained is reflected in our single price and extensive promotional offers provided to all of our customers. \u201cOperational and financial system constraints make any form of \u2018dual pricing\u2019 for our extensive product file a practical impossibility. The destination data, regardless of whether it is to the UK, EU or beyond allows WHSmith to analyse the purchasing trends by time of day and by product category for customers travelling to different locations, and assists us in product ranging and placement decisions at our airport stores. \u201cThis information is limited to the IATA three-digit destination airport codes, which form the basis of IATA\u2019s worldwide airport database and does not give access to any personal data of WH Smith customers.\u201d",

She said: \u201cIt is not compulsory to ask for [boarding cards] so if someone doesn\u2019t want to show it we won\u2019t force it.\u201d</p> <p>In a statement the company said information on boarding passes was used to ensure accurate accounting. It said: \u201cOur airport store teams are asked to request and scan boarding cards to ensure the accuracy of our accounting records, which includes the accurate reporting of VAT. We request our customers\u2019 boarding cards so that our VAT accounting is in line with the HMRC\u2019s requirements.</p> <p>It added: \u201cThe HMRC and airports accept that this is general practice for all retailers located within airport terminals. Our pricing in airport stores is consistent with our London prices and VAT is not taken into account when setting prices of products. Showing a boarding card is not a compulsory requirement and any of our customers that do not wish to share this information can shop with us without the boarding card being scanned.\u201d</p> <p>A former WH Smith employee at Manchester airport, who did not wish to be named, told the Guardian that store staff were told to check boarding passes as part of an unexplained \u201csurvey\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/aug/17/taking-a-stand-against-airport-vat-rip-offs\">Taking a stand against airport VAT rip-offs | Letters</a> </p> </aside>  <p>WH Smith confirmed that staff in its airport stores requested customers to show boarding passes, but conceded \u201cthere is no obligation on the part of the customer\u201d to do so.</p> <p>It added that dual pricing would be impossible to implement even though many duty-free shops already display two prices \u2013 one if you are flying in the EU and a lower price if you are flying outside the EU. </p> <p>It said: \u201cWhilst much of what we sell, eg newspapers, magazines and books, is fixed price and does not attract VAT, any VAT relief associated with the identification of customers travelling outside of the EU is reported in accordance with UK legislation, and any relief obtained is reflected in our single price and extensive promotional offers provided to all of our customers. </p> <p>\u201cOperational and financial system constraints make any form of \u2018dual pricing\u2019 for our extensive product file a practical impossibility. The destination data, regardless of whether it is to the UK, EU or beyond allows WHSmith to analyse the purchasing trends by time of day and by product category for customers travelling to different locations, and assists us in product ranging and placement decisions at our airport stores.</p> <p>\u201cThis information is limited to the IATA three-digit destination airport codes, which form the basis of IATA\u2019s worldwide airport database and does not give access to any personal data of WH Smith customers.\u201d</p>",

    "webTitle": "China stuns financial markets by devaluing yuan for second day running", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "China stunned the world\u2019s financial markets on Wednesday by devaluing its currency for a second consecutive day, triggering fears its economy is in worse shape than investors believed. The move sent fresh shockwaves through global markets, pushing shares sharply lower and sending commodity prices further into reverse as traders feared the move could also ignite a currency war that would destabilise the world economy. There were widespread losses on stock exchanges in Asia, and in Europe markets suffered falls of about 1%, with the FTSE 100 in London tumbling almost 2% at one stage before settling at 6571, down 1.4%. The Chinese authorities have acted after a string of poor economic figures showed that previous efforts to boost exports and growth against the headwind of an overvalued currency had failed. A drop of 6.6% in car sales in July followed data at the weekend showing an 8% fall in exports and slowing business investment growth in the same month. A survey tracking China\u2019s factory output for July also missed expectations, coming in at 6% year-on-year growth instead of the 6.6% expected. One financial analyst said the devaluation, which pushed the yuan to a four-year low, heralded a tidal wave of cheap goods from Asia as other south east Asian countries followed suit. Albert Edwards, analyst at Societe Generale, said the yuan had become overvalued against the dollar in recent years and was unsustainably high relative to other major currencies. The Chinese currency hit a four-year low on Wednesday after the People\u2019s Bank of China set the yuan\u2019s daily midpoint even weaker than in Tuesday\u2019s devaluation. Unlike the pound and other major currencies, the yuan\u2019s value is determined each day by the People\u2019s Bank based on movements the previous day. As part of the devaluation, the authorities said they would widen the criteria to include more market information, allowing the currency to rise or fall more rapidly than before. The central bank sought to reassure financial markets that it was not embarking on a steady depreciation. \u201cLooking at the international and domestic economic situation, currently there is no basis for a sustained depreciation trend for the yuan,\u201d it said. A spokesman said the downward movement of the currency was a result of a project to liberalise its management and not a deliberate attempt to drive down its value. But with the bank having said on Tuesday that that day\u2019s action was a \u201cone-off depreciation\u201d, the rapid two-day drop in the value of the currency of about 4% dealt a blow to investors. They fear a prolonged currency war that could damage world trade should the US and Japan retaliate and drive down the value of the dollar and yen. Oil prices remained below $50 a barrel, down from more than $110 a barrel last summer when the slowdown in China first became apparent. The prices of key industrial and construction metals \u2013 nickel, copper and aluminium \u2013 hit six-year lows. Rajeev De Mello, head of Asian fixed income at Schroders in Singapore, said: \u201cWhile it is too early to say whether this is the beginning of a sustained devaluation of the yuan, other central banks may be forced to follow suit and that may trigger a fresh round of currency weakening around the emerging world.\u201d The two devaluations come after a run of poor economic data and have raised suspicions that China is embarking on a longer-term slide in the exchange rate. A cheaper yuan will help Chinese exports by making them less expensive on overseas markets. The first move on Tuesday was the biggest one-day fall in the yuan since a massive devaluation in 1994. On Wednesday the yuan fell to 6.43 against the dollar, its weakest point since August 2011. The currency fared worse in offshore trade, touching 6.57. The International Monetary Fund said China\u2019s move to make the yuan more responsive to market forces appeared to be a welcome step and that Beijing should aim to achieve an effectively floating exchange rate within two to three years. Beijing has been lobbying the IMF to include the yuan in its basket of reserve currencies, known as Special Drawing Rights, which it uses to lend to sovereign borrowers. This would mark a major step in the international use of the Chinese currency. \u201cGreater exchange rate flexibility is important for China as it strives to give market forces a decisive role in the economy and is rapidly integrating into global financial markets,\u201d an IMF spokesperson said.",

They fear a prolonged currency war that could damage world trade should the US and Japan retaliate and drive down the value of the dollar and yen. <br></p> <p>Oil prices remained below $50 a barrel, down from more than $110 a barrel last summer when the slowdown in China first became apparent.
