    "sectionName": "Business", 
    "webTitle": "Euro crisis deepens as time starts to run out for Spain's banks and regions", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Spain dragged the eurozone closer to the edge of collapse despite winning the backing of finance ministers from the single currency's major economies for a \u20ac100bn (\u00a377.8bn) bank rescue fund. Concerns that Madrid is running out of options to bring down the debts of its ailing banks and bankrupt regions sent the country's borrowing costs soaring above 7.2% \u2013 a rate seen as unsustainable for a country that cannot devalue its own currency and is suffering a lengthy double-dip recession. The bank bailout had been supposed to push down the country's borrowing rates, but the country's problems continue to mount. On Friday the region of Valencia was forced to turn to the Spanish central government for cash help. That move, together with a downgrade of Spanish bonds to junk status by the credit ratings agency Egan Jones, saw the Madrid stock market suffer its biggest one day fall for two years. Markets in London, Paris and Frankfurt followed suit with the FTSE 100 falling 1% to 5651. The euro crashed to historic lows against several currencies. Against the pound it fell to 77.72 pence, marking its lowest since the aftermath of the Lehman Brothers collapse in October 2008. The prospect of Spain standing near the exit to the eurozone with Greece and Portugal had seemed outlandish only a few weeks ago, after eurozone leaders agreed to press ahead with more co-operation and a rescue for Madrid that targeted its banks. Stock markets climbed and solvency fears eased after the summit, which many saw as provided a lengthy breathing space for politicians to work out a broader rescue package. But the shortcomings of the agreement have once again undermined renewed confidence in the eurozone and sent the bond yields of several countries higher, including Spain and Italy. Comments by German officials added to the febrile atmosphere with hardliners questioning the eurozone's ability to carry on while southern European countries wrestled with major reforms and public spending cuts. The Spanish government said a predicted rise in GDP next year of 0.4% had proved optimistic, and the economy would suffer another year of recession. The new forecast that the economy will contract by 0.5% shocked analysts, who said a raft of austerity measures would delay a recovery for several years. Mariano Rajoy, the leader of Spain's right-wing government, has pushed through \u20ac65bn (\u00a350.6bn) of spending cuts and tax rises to meet deficit targets set by Brussels, which are widely blamed for pushing the economy back into recession for another year. Shortly before the bank bailout was agreed by eurozone ministers on Friday, the Valencia regional government admitted it could no longer fund itself on the markets and requested what is, in effect, a bailout by the Spanish government. Regional governments deliver the key parts of the welfare state, including health, education and social services. Eastern Valencia said it was asking for central government help as it could not refinance loans that must be paid off this year. Regional vice president Jos\u00e9 Ciscar did not say how much was needed. \"Like other regions, Valencia is suffering the consequences of liquidity restrictions in the markets,\" he said. It will become the first of Spain's 17 semi-autonomous regions to tap a new, week-old \u20ac18bn (\u00a314bn) fund designed to provide them with liquidity. The fund is part-financed with a loan from the state-owned lottery company. Valencia, which has long been run by Rajoy's PP, is emblematic of Spain's current crisis. A property crash has hit both regional government income and the region's banks, with its three main banks having to be rescued. Local politicians, meanwhile, have a growing reputation for corruption and frivolous spending. Valencia mopped up a quarter of the \u20ac17bn (\u00a313.2bn) of extra money made available by central government in April to pay a backlog of regional government bills. Just as Rajoy's government refuses to call the European rescue fund money a bailout, so Valencia's government insisted its request for special funding should not be described as one. \"Valencia is signing up to a financing mechanism which other regions will also need in the coming days, without any further measures,\" Ciscar said. Last year the regions not only failed to meet government-set deficit reduction targets, but actually increased their joint deficit. Rajoy's government has passed legislation allowing it to take direct control of the finances of regions that stray too far off target. Analysts believe most regions will miss this year's 1.5 percent deficit target.

Analysts at Capital Economics said Spain had suffered a debilitating exodus of funds from its banks and a sharp detioration in its own funding position.

      "body": "<p>Spain dragged the eurozone closer to the edge of collapse despite winning the backing of finance ministers from the single currency's major economies for a \u20ac100bn (\u00a377.8bn) bank rescue fund.</p> <p>Concerns that Madrid is running out of options to bring down the debts of its ailing banks and bankrupt regions sent the country's borrowing costs soaring above 7.2% \u2013 a rate seen as unsustainable for a country that cannot devalue its own currency and is suffering a lengthy double-dip recession.</p> <p>The bank bailout had been supposed to push down the country's borrowing rates, but the country's problems continue to mount. On Friday the region of Valencia was forced to turn to the Spanish central government for cash help.</p> <p>That move, together with a downgrade of Spanish bonds to junk status by the credit ratings agency Egan Jones, saw the Madrid stock market suffer its biggest one day fall for two years.</p> <p>Markets in London, Paris and Frankfurt followed suit with the FTSE 100 falling 1% to 5651. The euro crashed to historic lows against several currencies. Against the pound it fell to 77.72 pence, marking its lowest since the aftermath of the Lehman Brothers collapse in October 2008.</p> <p>The prospect of Spain standing near the exit to the eurozone with Greece and Portugal had seemed outlandish only a few weeks ago, after eurozone leaders agreed to press ahead with more co-operation and a rescue for Madrid that targeted its banks.</p> <p>Stock markets climbed and solvency fears eased after the summit, which many saw as provided a lengthy breathing space for politicians to work out a broader rescue package. But the shortcomings of the agreement have once again undermined renewed confidence in the eurozone and sent the bond yields of several countries higher, including Spain and Italy.</p> <p>Comments by German officials added to the febrile atmosphere with hardliners questioning the eurozone's ability to carry on while southern European countries wrestled with major reforms and public spending cuts.</p> <p>The Spanish government said a predicted rise in GDP next year of 0.4% had proved optimistic, and the economy would suffer another year of recession. The new forecast that the economy will contract by 0.5% shocked analysts, who said a raft of austerity measures would delay a recovery for several years.</p> <p>Mariano Rajoy, the leader of Spain's right-wing government, has pushed through \u20ac65bn (\u00a350.6bn) of spending cuts and tax rises to meet deficit targets set by Brussels, which are widely blamed for pushing the economy back into recession for another year.</p> <p>Shortly before the bank bailout was agreed by eurozone ministers on Friday, the Valencia regional government admitted it could no longer fund itself on the markets and requested what is, in effect, a bailout by the Spanish government. Regional governments deliver the key parts of the welfare state, including health, education and social services.</p> <p>Eastern Valencia said it was asking for central government help as it could not refinance loans that must be paid off this year. Regional vice president Jos\u00e9 Ciscar did not say how much was needed. \"Like other regions, Valencia is suffering the consequences of liquidity restrictions in the markets,\" he said.</p> <p>It will become the first of Spain's 17 semi-autonomous regions to tap a new, week-old \u20ac18bn (\u00a314bn) fund designed to provide them with liquidity. The fund is part-financed with a loan from the state-owned lottery company.</p> <p>Valencia, which has long been run by Rajoy's PP, is emblematic of Spain's current crisis. A property crash has hit both regional government income and the region's banks, with its three main banks having to be rescued. Local politicians, meanwhile, have a growing reputation for corruption and frivolous spending.</p> <p>Valencia mopped up a quarter of the \u20ac17bn (\u00a313.2bn) of extra money made available by central government in April to pay a backlog of regional government bills.</p> <p>Just as Rajoy's government refuses to call the European rescue fund money a bailout, so Valencia's government insisted its request for special funding should not be described as one. \"Valencia is signing up to a financing mechanism which other regions will also need in the coming days, without any further measures,\" Ciscar said.</p> <p>Last year the regions not only failed to meet government-set deficit reduction targets, but actually increased their joint deficit. Rajoy's government has passed legislation allowing it to take direct control of the finances of regions that stray too far off target.</p> <p>Analysts believe most regions will miss this year's 1.5 percent deficit target. The government last week asked at least eight of them to revise their 2012 budgets, threatening to take over the finances of some of them.</p> <p>Analysts at Capital Economics said Spain had suffered a debilitating exodus of funds from its banks and a sharp detioration in its own funding position. As the reliance of the Spanish government on its own banks for funding grows (while the banks themselves are relying on the ECB), so the likelihood of Spain requiring a full-blown sovereign bailout grows too.</p> <p>European leaders pleaded for calm after signing the final agreement to lend Spain \u20ac100bn of funds to underpin its banks.</p> <p>European Central Bank executive Beno\u00eet C\u0153ur\u00e9 said at a conference in Mexico that it was startling to see international investors fearful of getting their money back from members of the single currency.</p> <p>However, he said the fundamental measures of economic success were stronger in the eurozone than other developed areas.

The warning is revealed in 80 pages of emails from 2008 released by the Bank of England on Friday as part of its attempt to deflect criticism by MPs that it had been warned by regulators in New York about problems with the rate setting process. The emails show that the BBA, which oversees the setting of Libor, had wanted the Bank of England to take a bigger role in the rate setting process but was rebuffed by the central bank. Libor is set by a panel of banks which are asked the price at which they think they might be able to borrow on the markets, rather than the actual price at which they could borrow. One email, dated 21 May 2008, appears to show that Angela Knight, the chief executive of the BBA, was aware of the potential for banks to submit rates not reflecting the price at which they though they might borrow.

The \u00a3290m fine levelled on Barclays last month for trying to manipulate the level of Libor has sparked controversy about what the Bank of England, the Financial Services Authority (FSA) and the BBA knew about problems with the rate, particularly because the Federal Reserve in New York was also concerned about Libor.

      "body": "<p>It was another bad week for the banking industry, with the continuing libor-fixing scandal, accusations of money laundering for drugs barons and new fears of further eurozone bailouts.</p> <p>All that helped drag markets sharply lower, after the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> had looked set to record its seventh successive week of gains. The pressure intensified once Spain's bond yields soared to new highs after its heavily endebted Valencia region asked for financial help from central government. At the same time Spain cut its economic forecast for 2013 from 0.2% growth to a 0.5% decline, amid continuing protests against its austerity programme.</p> <p>So the leading index ended the day 62.42 points lower at 5651.77, a 15 point fall on the week.</p> <p><strong>Barclays</strong>, down 5p at 159.25p, continued to be in the firing line over libor, but the bank's analysts decided to pick on rival <strong>Lloyds Banking Group</strong> as the UK's weakest link. In a new note which avoided mentioning the interest rate investigation, they put an underweight rating and 27p price target on Lloyds, which on Thursday agreed to sell 632 branches at a knock-down price to the Co-op. Barclays said:</p> <blockquote> With leading market shares in UK retail banking, Lloyds is often perceived as a structurally higher-return business, particularly when compared to its domestic peers. However, we believe that large loss-making or low-return non-core and wholesale divisions and a shrinking higher-return retail business will lead to continued disappointment on returns at the group level. <br> In addition, Lloyds is the most weakly capitalised UK bank on a Basel III basis, which leads to lower capital-adjusted returns and makes the resumption of dividends look unlikely. Reflecting this as well as increased regulatory risk and ongoing Eurozone concerns, we reinstate an underweight rating. </blockquote> <p>As it happened Lloyds performed better than Barclays, although it closed 0.295p lower at 29.94p. Meanwhile <strong>HSBC</strong>, implicated in money laundering in Mexico, fell 16.2p to 533.2p. <strong>Royal Bank of Scotland</strong> lost 7.6p to 204.7p while <strong>Standard Chartered</strong> dropped 26.5p to 1492.5p.</p> <p>Insurer <strong>Resolution</strong> lost 12.4p to 215.5p after it cancelled a proposed \u00a3250m cash return to shareholders because of current market uncertainty. Smaller rival <strong>Phoenix</strong>, tipped as a possible bid target for Resolution, fell 15p to 490.5p on the basis that was now less likely</p> <p>Following the Olympic security guard fiasco, <strong>G4S</strong> failed to convince investors the problems were under control, not helped by an uninspiring performance by chief executive Nick Buckles at a select committee hearing. The company's shares closed 1.7p lower at 241.8p, down 36.9p from the start of the week. It has lost nearly \u00a3700m from its market value since the problems first emerged.</p> <p>Rival outsourcing group <strong>Capita</strong> closed 4p lower at 689p ahead of first half results next week, despite a buy note from UBS. The bank said:</p> <blockquote> G4S's well-documented Olympics contract issues have shown outsourcing in a negative light. Police outsourcing is a key new market for Capita (albeit less than 5% of its \u00a34.6bn current pipeline) and has come under further scrutiny, with the West Midlands/Surrey contract in some doubt. An update on likelihood, changes to and timing of larger current bids will be important, less for 2012 where we see organic growth as well underpinned but for 2013 and beyond. </blockquote> <p>UBS also said it hoped for news on possible acquisitions:</p> <blockquote> Capita has indicated the April equity placing, raising \u00a3274m, was almost all to fund future M&amp;A. Two smaller acquisitions have since been completed but we hope for an update on where/when the rest of this capital will be spent. </blockquote> <p><strong>Vodafone</strong> fell 3.05p to 180p after the mobile phone group issued a disappointing trading statement, a day after its hopes of a dividend payment from its US joint venture Verizon Wireless were seemingly dashed.</p> <p><strong>BG</strong> dipped 0.5p to 1289.5p despite the gases group and its partners signing $4.5bn worth of deals for the construction of platforms to develop their projects in the Santos Basin in Brazil. Andrew Whittock at Liberum Capital said the news showed the projects were making good progress:</p> <blockquote> The awards, along with a tender process for an additional [floating production, storage and offloading unit], demonstrate the intent of the partners to deliver the fast-track development of the massive resources.

      "bodyText": "It was another bad week for the banking industry, with the continuing libor-fixing scandal, accusations of money laundering for drugs barons and new fears of further eurozone bailouts. All that helped drag markets sharply lower, after the FTSE 100 had looked set to record its seventh successive week of gains. The pressure intensified once Spain's bond yields soared to new highs after its heavily endebted Valencia region asked for financial help from central government. At the same time Spain cut its economic forecast for 2013 from 0.2% growth to a 0.5% decline, amid continuing protests against its austerity programme. So the leading index ended the day 62.42 points lower at 5651.77, a 15 point fall on the week. Barclays, down 5p at 159.25p, continued to be in the firing line over libor, but the bank's analysts decided to pick on rival Lloyds Banking Group as the UK's weakest link. In a new note which avoided mentioning the interest rate investigation, they put an underweight rating and 27p price target on Lloyds, which on Thursday agreed to sell 632 branches at a knock-down price to the Co-op. Barclays said: With leading market shares in UK retail banking, Lloyds is often perceived as a structurally higher-return business, particularly when compared to its domestic peers. However, we believe that large loss-making or low-return non-core and wholesale divisions and a shrinking higher-return retail business will lead to continued disappointment on returns at the group level. In addition, Lloyds is the most weakly capitalised UK bank on a Basel III basis, which leads to lower capital-adjusted returns and makes the resumption of dividends look unlikely. Reflecting this as well as increased regulatory risk and ongoing Eurozone concerns, we reinstate an underweight rating. As it happened Lloyds performed better than Barclays, although it closed 0.295p lower at 29.94p. Meanwhile HSBC, implicated in money laundering in Mexico, fell 16.2p to 533.2p. Royal Bank of Scotland lost 7.6p to 204.7p while Standard Chartered dropped 26.5p to 1492.5p. Insurer Resolution lost 12.4p to 215.5p after it cancelled a proposed \u00a3250m cash return to shareholders because of current market uncertainty. Smaller rival Phoenix, tipped as a possible bid target for Resolution, fell 15p to 490.5p on the basis that was now less likely Following the Olympic security guard fiasco, G4S failed to convince investors the problems were under control, not helped by an uninspiring performance by chief executive Nick Buckles at a select committee hearing. The company's shares closed 1.7p lower at 241.8p, down 36.9p from the start of the week. It has lost nearly \u00a3700m from its market value since the problems first emerged. Rival outsourcing group Capita closed 4p lower at 689p ahead of first half results next week, despite a buy note from UBS. The bank said: G4S's well-documented Olympics contract issues have shown outsourcing in a negative light. Police outsourcing is a key new market for Capita (albeit less than 5% of its \u00a34.6bn current pipeline) and has come under further scrutiny, with the West Midlands/Surrey contract in some doubt. An update on likelihood, changes to and timing of larger current bids will be important, less for 2012 where we see organic growth as well underpinned but for 2013 and beyond. UBS also said it hoped for news on possible acquisitions: Capita has indicated the April equity placing, raising \u00a3274m, was almost all to fund future M&amp;A. Two smaller acquisitions have since been completed but we hope for an update on where/when the rest of this capital will be spent. Vodafone fell 3.05p to 180p after the mobile phone group issued a disappointing trading statement, a day after its hopes of a dividend payment from its US joint venture Verizon Wireless were seemingly dashed. BG dipped 0.5p to 1289.5p despite the gases group and its partners signing $4.5bn worth of deals for the construction of platforms to develop their projects in the Santos Basin in Brazil. Andrew Whittock at Liberum Capital said the news showed the projects were making good progress: The awards, along with a tender process for an additional [floating production, storage and offloading unit], demonstrate the intent of the partners to deliver the fast-track development of the massive resources. Progress also continues in Australia and BG appears on-track to ramp-up near-term production and meet longer term volume targets. The shares have bounced off their lows but are still below our value for BG's current assets (1507p) which we see as a floor for the price. The shares may look relatively expensive but we still believe this is justified by the long-term growth profile. We retain our positive view and buy recommendation. BG's shares flared up early in the week after analysts at Barclays talked up the potential for its liquefied natural gas business. But they were soon deflated after Credit Suisse cast doubt on its Brazilian and Australian operations, with analyst Thomas Adolff saying the market had not fully appreciated the transitional challenges the company faced. He said the company's new chief executive, to be unveiled next February, should consider a partial sale of the Australian and Brazilian businesses to unlock value for shareholders. Shares in International Airlines Group lost 5.3p to 154.8p after a bond issue for its British Airways subsidiary failed to take off. Early in July the group said it hoped to raise \u00a3250m with its first secured bond, to be backed by its take-off and landing slots at Heathrow and its routes between London City Airport and New York. But it has now said it would not proceed with the issue: There was a lack of demand for this bond at a price which would compare with other financing alternatives. CRH, the FTSE 100 building materials group, closed 25p lower at \u00a311.79 in the wake of reports earlier in the week that it was interested in a \u00a31bn deal to buy cement plants in India, but pumps group Weir rose 6p to \u00a315.31, benefitting from positive trading news from US peers Baker Hughes and Gardner Denver. A couple of days after denying it was in takeover talks, troubled insurance and repairs group Homeserve issued a soothing annual meeting statement. In its latest update Homeserve said it was making progress in simplifying and refocusing its business, although the investigation into its past actions by the Financial Services Authority are likely to hang over it for months. Even so, the shares added 6.6p to 195p following the statement. After recent gloomy news from the high street, Dixons Retail proved a bright spark. Its shares added 1.6% to 16.52p in the wake of a positive weekly update from John Lewis and reports of strong sales of white goods such as tumble driers. John Lewis reported overall sales at its department stores were up 17.3% year on year, with electrical goods up 37%, the best figure since early June. Analyst Richard Cathcart at Espirito Santo said this was positive news for Dixons, given its move towards more high tech and service led premium lines.

Their cost of production is around 30p per litre but after 1 August the price won't even cover their costs of production.\"</p> <p>Newbery said milk processors had been selling liquid milk to supermarkets at vastly reduced prices in order to secure lucrative contracts.

They also single out the Co-op. Although the recent cuts will not affect farmers supplying Tesco, Sainsbury's, Marks &amp; Spencer or Waitrose, the NFU estimates that the drop will have an impact on a quarter of the milk market volume in this country. In the long run, consumers could end up paying more for their pints.</p> <p>While the government says it cannot intervene in the setting of milk prices, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has convened a number of meetings with farmers' unions, processors and retailers next week. It hopes all parties will come together and agree a voluntary code for the industry. According to those involved in the negotiations, the code is intended to address grievances over the length of contracts and short-notice price changes.</p> <p>Jim Paice, the farming minister, said: \"These price cuts are a severe blow for dairy farmers.&#xa0;Government cannot and should not set prices but&#xa0;I will do everything in my power to get all levels of the supply chain to make the real changes needed to&#xa0;guarantee the industry's long-term future.</p> <p>\"Farmers and processors need to work together through an industry code of practice on contracts, and retailers have to help shift the focus away from short-term practices which are completely unsustainable.\"</p> <p>A spokesman for Dairy UK, which represents milk processors, said it was working towards a voluntary code but maintained that the current dispute had been prompted by a fall in the international price of dairy products.</p> <p>He said: \"These markets are extremely competitive and enormously volatile. We cannot insulate ourselves from world market trends.\"</p> <p>When contacted by the Guardian, Arla, Robert Wiseman and Dairy Crest agreed they understood the strength of feeling among dairy farmers but were unable to restore milk prices.</p> <p>Both Asda and the Co-op said they would increase the premium they pay to farmers. But unions said this would still not be enough to cover the farmers' cost of production. A spokesman for Morrisons said the supermarket hoped to be able to give an update at the beginning of next week.</p> <p>At present there are more than 14,000 dairy farmers in the UK.

In the long run, consumers could end up paying more for their pints. While the government says it cannot intervene in the setting of milk prices, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has convened a number of meetings with farmers' unions, processors and retailers next week. It hopes all parties will come together and agree a voluntary code for the industry. According to those involved in the negotiations, the code is intended to address grievances over the length of contracts and short-notice price changes. Jim Paice, the farming minister, said: \"These price cuts are a severe blow for dairy farmers. Government cannot and should not set prices but I will do everything in my power to get all levels of the supply chain to make the real changes needed to guarantee the industry's long-term future. \"Farmers and processors need to work together through an industry code of practice on contracts, and retailers have to help shift the focus away from short-term practices which are completely unsustainable.\" A spokesman for Dairy UK, which represents milk processors, said it was working towards a voluntary code but maintained that the current dispute had been prompted by a fall in the international price of dairy products. He said: \"These markets are extremely competitive and enormously volatile. We cannot insulate ourselves from world market trends.\" When contacted by the Guardian, Arla, Robert Wiseman and Dairy Crest agreed they understood the strength of feeling among dairy farmers but were unable to restore milk prices. Both Asda and the Co-op said they would increase the premium they pay to farmers. But unions said this would still not be enough to cover the farmers' cost of production. A spokesman for Morrisons said the supermarket hoped to be able to give an update at the beginning of next week. At present there are more than 14,000 dairy farmers in the UK. The sector is worth an annual \u00a33.3bn.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Three of Britain's police forces are considering dropping plans to outsource support jobs to G4S following the firm's Olympic security fiasco, it has emerged. The chief constables of Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire met on Thursday and agreed to reconsider a move to shift 1,100 \"back office\" posts to the security contractor. The re-evaluation of contracts came as the home secretary, Theresa May, and senior police officers defended the overall security operation as they toured the Olympic Park in Stratford, east London. The Olympic delivery chairman, Lord Coe, also told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that security was on track: \"We've got the numbers to make sure this is a safe and secure Games,\" he said. The three forces last month committed to working with G4S to save \u00a373m after being given the go-ahead to investigate outsourcing \"backroom\" services. But G4S has since admitted to a series of failings over its contract to provide security staff for the Olympics. A shortfall in the number of security guards has forced the government to deploy 3,500 extra troops, and police officers have been drafted in from across the country. In a joint statement, the three forces confirmed a meeting had been held to discuss outsourcing with G4S. \"Their meeting enabled them to consider the findings of the review of the contract to date and assess how it could meet the complex requirements of the three forces,\" it reads. \"The chief constables are continuing this discussion and will share their assessment with police authority members at a meeting of the Strategic Alliance Joint Working Group early next week.\" Any changes to the programme will have to be formally considered in public by each police authority. Julian Huppert, the Liberal Democrat MP for Cambridge and a member of the home affairs select committee, called for the police authorities to review the contract when they meet on Monday. \"It is right that they look very carefully at this proposal given what we have found out about G4S over the security of the Olympics. I think that all of their contracts with the police should now be re-examined . \"There is a problem in how big G4S are and whether they can cover sensitive police work. Even if you are a supporter of outsourcing of security work, there does not seem to be a big enough range of suppliers,\" he said. The Scotland Yard commissioner, Bernard Hogan-Howe, admitted the problem of security firm G4S not supplying enough guards was \"unfortunate\", but said bringing in 3,500 extra troops could have its benefits. \"It's not a bad solution to have about 11,000 fully trained soldiers under a military command from one of the best armies in the world,\" he said. \"It seems to me that the contingencies will be put in place and we'll all be kept safe.\" May, speaking on a tour of the Olympic Park, said her department was told last month by G4S that it would be able to resolve problems and supply enough Olympic guards. She denied being selective in what she told MPs, insisting the gap in the numbers only became clear on July 11, not two weeks earlier when the firm first reported problems. \"In early July it was clear that there were some initial problems which G4S said they would resolve,\" May said. \"And crucially it was not until July 11 that G4S finally said, 'Actually we can't resolve those initial problems, we won't be able to provide the personnel'.\" She added: \"I haven't been at all selective. What I've been is absolutely clear with the House of Commons and others about how these things developed.\" Asked what the Home Office was told at a meeting with G4S and Olympic organisers Locog on 27 June, May said: \"What happened was there were some early signs of a problem with rostering staff for G4S. \"It was clear that G4S felt they were capable of dealing with that, that it would be resolved, and it was on July 11 as the chief executive of G4S told parliament, the home affairs select committee, that G4S said, 'Actually, we now believe we cannot produce the staff we were contracted to produce'.\" Asked if G4S should be barred from taking on any government contracts in the future, she said the government was working with the firm on both the Olympics and Paralympics, as well as a number of other contracts. \"G4S will still be providing a significant number of venue security personnel,\" May said. When asked on the Today programme about when he knew there were problems with the G4S contract, Lord Coe said: \"At exactly the same time as the home secretary identified the need to act quickly and prudently, and that was when we started the transitional period of lockdown \u2026 which basically means securitising the whole of the park \u2013 it was 11 July.\" But he played down the impact of the problems. \"This is not an issue that has remotely compromised security. This was actually about the supply and the mix,\" he said. \"We got the numbers,\" Coe added, \"Courtesy of the military and our police services, we've got the numbers to make sure this is a safe and secure Games.\" Coe said it was no surprise that some contracts had not run smoothly. \"We are managing thousands of contracts, but guess what? Not every contract is going to be delivered or has been delivered the way we wanted to it. We deal with this on a minute-by-minute, hour-by-hour basis and we've done that and that's what our business has been over the last seven years. And as soon as we found that there was fragility in G4S's ability to get those bodies on to those jobs that they'd been rostered for we acted very quickly.\"",

    "sectionName": "Business", 
    "webTitle": "Rise in government borrowing adds to George Osborne's woes", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The chancellor, George Osborne, could be forced to borrow an extra \u00a320bn this year after figures showed a bigger-than-expected shortfall in the public finances in June. A rise in government spending to cope with higher social security bills, combined with a fall in tax receipts, has left the Treasury scrabbling to meet its borrowing target for the end of the year. Osborne expects to borrow \u00a3120bn this year, but a near 12% overshoot in his calculations in the first few months of the year could lead to a \u00a3140bn borrowing requirement when the tax year finishes next April. The chancellor has predicted that a mix of tax rises and welfare cuts will cut borrowing to just \u00a321bn by 2016/17. But the expectation of a prolonged double dip recession and a recovery that could take years to get under way has undermined his plans. The prime minister, David Cameron, said earlier this week that he may need to keep austerity measures in place for a decade to reach the government's borrowing target. A spokesman for the Treasury said it was too early to tell how the public finances would look in a year. He added that the level of borrowing could be revised downwards, as it was last year, to below the target. However, several economists said the chancellor should take little comfort from revisions to past data. The International Monetary Fund has also warned the government that it risks permanently damaging economic output unless it spends more on infrastructure projects and delays welfare cuts to boost confidence and private consumption. Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said: \"Three months into the fiscal year, and Osborne is already facing an almighty struggle to meet his fiscal targets for 2012/13 and looks ever more likely to miss them. The current weakness of the economy is clearly taking a serious toll on tax receipts while spending is currently rising at a well above target rate. It is of only minor consolation to the chancellor that the Public Sector Net Borrowing Requirement (PSNBR) in 2011/12 was revised down to \u00a3125.7bn from the previously reported \u00a3127.6bn.\" The Office for National Statistics said the PSNBR, excluding the bank rescue funds, rose last month to \u00a314.45bn from \u00a313.92bn in June 2011. Archer said borrowing for the first three months of the financial year amounted to \u00a342.9bn, which is up from \u00a338.4bn in the first three months of 2011/12. \"In other words, the underlying PSNBR is up by 11.7% year-on-year in the first three months of 2012/13 compared with a targeted drop over the whole fiscal year of around 4.5%,\" he said. \"If this trend was to be continued over the rest of the fiscal year, the PSNBR would come in around \u00a3140bn, which would be \u00a320bn above the targeted \u00a3120bn.\" Chris Williamson, chief economist at financial data provider Markit, said the government's plans had been undermined by a lack of growth. \"First, and most significantly, weaker-than-anticipated growth has led to lower-than-expected tax revenues. Tax revenues rose just 3.6% on a year ago in June, and are up just 2.5% so far this tax year,\" he said. \"There seems little scope for revenue growth to pick up soon, given the fall in [industry surveys] to an eight-month low in June. The government's deficit reduction target was based on a projection of economic growth of 0.8% this year, but most forecasters now expect GDP to rise by less than half of the official forecast.\" Williamson added that weak growth had resulted in a further impact in higher welfare bills, underpinned by an unemployment rate of 8.1%. He added: \"Government spending fell 0.8% on a year ago in June, which is encouraging, but is 2.1% higher so far this year compared with last year.\" Much of the current overshoot in borrowing was due to a smaller surplus in local government finances than last year, because of deferred or reduced central government grants, the ONS added. While rising unemployment has driven up spending on benefits, earlier this month the Institute for Fiscal Studies thinktank said Treasury figures showed government departments had spent \u00a36.7bn less in the 2011/2012 fiscal year than planned under the austerity budget. Britain's total public sector net debt, excluding financial sector interventions, rose to \u00a31.04tn or a record 66.1% of GDP in June. Including the cost of bank support, it now represents 144.5% of GDP.",

      "body": "<p>The chancellor, George Osborne, could be forced to borrow an extra \u00a320bn this year after figures showed a bigger-than-expected shortfall in the public finances in June.</p> <p>A rise in government spending to cope with higher social security bills, combined with a fall in tax receipts, has left the Treasury scrabbling to meet its borrowing target for the end of the year.</p> <p>Osborne expects to borrow \u00a3120bn this year, but a near 12% overshoot in his calculations in the first few months of the year could lead to a \u00a3140bn borrowing requirement when the tax year finishes next April.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-393393996\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/maps_and_graphs/2012/7/20/1342777772753/Public-sector-borrowing-001.png\" alt=\"Public sector borrowing\" width=\"220\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Public sector borrowing</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The chancellor has predicted that a mix of tax rises and welfare cuts will cut borrowing to just \u00a321bn by 2016/17. But the expectation of a prolonged double dip recession and a recovery that could take years to get under way has undermined his plans.</p> <p>The prime minister, David Cameron, said earlier this week that he may need to keep austerity measures in place for a decade to reach the government's borrowing target.</p> <p>A spokesman for the Treasury said it was too early to tell how the public finances would look in a year. He added that the level of borrowing could be revised downwards, as it was last year, to below the target.</p> <p>However, several economists said the chancellor should take little comfort from revisions to past data. The International Monetary Fund has also warned the government that it risks <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/jul/19/imf-uk-boost-spending-save-economy\" title=\"\">permanently damaging economic output</a> unless it spends more on infrastructure projects and delays welfare cuts to boost confidence and private consumption.</p> <p>Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said: \"Three months into the fiscal year, and Osborne is already facing an almighty struggle to meet his fiscal targets for 2012/13 and looks ever more likely to miss them. The current weakness of the economy is clearly taking a serious toll on tax receipts while spending is currently rising at a well above target rate. It is of only minor consolation to the chancellor that the Public Sector Net Borrowing Requirement (PSNBR) in 2011/12 was revised down to \u00a3125.7bn from the previously reported \u00a3127.6bn.\"</p> <p>The Office for National Statistics said the PSNBR, excluding the bank rescue funds, rose last month to \u00a314.45bn from \u00a313.92bn in June 2011.</p> <p>Archer said borrowing for the first three months of the financial year amounted to \u00a342.9bn, which is up from \u00a338.4bn in the first three months of 2011/12.</p> <p>\"In other words, the underlying PSNBR is up by 11.7% year-on-year in the first three months of 2012/13 compared with a targeted drop over the whole fiscal year of around 4.5%,\" he said. \"If this trend was to be continued over the rest of the fiscal year, the PSNBR would come in around \u00a3140bn, which would be \u00a320bn above the targeted \u00a3120bn.\"</p> <p>Chris Williamson, chief economist at financial data provider Markit, said the government's plans had been undermined by a lack of growth.</p> <p>\"First, and most significantly, weaker-than-anticipated growth has led to lower-than-expected tax revenues. Tax revenues rose just 3.6% on a year ago in June, and are up just 2.5% so far this tax year,\" he said. \"There seems little scope for revenue growth to pick up soon, given the fall in [industry surveys] to an eight-month low in June. The government's deficit reduction target was based on a projection of economic growth of 0.8% this year, but most forecasters now expect GDP to rise by less than half of the official forecast.\"</p> <p>Williamson added that weak growth had resulted in a further impact in higher welfare bills, underpinned by an unemployment rate of 8.1%. He added: \"Government spending fell 0.8% on a year ago in June, which is encouraging, but is 2.1% higher so far this year compared with last year.\"</p> <p>Much of the current overshoot in borrowing was due to a smaller surplus in local government finances than last year, because of deferred or reduced central government grants, the ONS added.</p> <p>While rising unemployment has driven up spending on benefits, earlier this month the Institute for Fiscal Studies thinktank said Treasury figures showed government departments had spent \u00a36.7bn less in the 2011/2012 fiscal year than planned under the austerity budget.</p> <p>Britain's total public sector net debt, excluding financial sector interventions, rose to \u00a31.04tn or a record 66.1% of GDP in June. Including the cost of bank support, it now represents 144.5% of GDP.</p>",
