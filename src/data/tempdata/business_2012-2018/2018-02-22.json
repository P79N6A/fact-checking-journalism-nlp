      "bodyText": "Woolworths has increased its first-half profit by 37.6% to $969m as it continued its recovery from a costly exit from the home improvement sector. The retail giant saw a 4.9% rise year on year in comparable food sales, far outpacing that of rival Coles, which on Wednesday recorded comparable food and liquor sales growth of 0.9% for the half. Woolworths has increased its interim dividend by more than 25% to a fully franked 43 cents. Pre-tax earnings for the 27 weeks to 31 December jumped 9.9%, driven by its supermarkets, Dan Murphy\u2019s, BWS and the group\u2019s hotels, with total group revenue rising 3.8% to $30bn. It marks a significant recovery from 2016, when Woolworths posted a $1.23bn full-year loss as a result of a big decline in earnings from its Australian food and drink business and more than $2.6bn of writedowns, much of which related to its struggling Masters stores. Chief executive Brad Banducci said food sales growth might moderate in the second half, but added that Big W would help offset that. Banducci, who led the supermarkets division before becoming chief executive, said the growth was an early sign of the group\u2019s transformation. \u201cThe emphasis on transforming our business will continue in the second half and into the 2019 financial year,\u201d Banducci said in a statement to the ASX on Friday. \u201cOur goal is to deliver a consistently good experience for our customers and team and leverage end-to-end process redesign and technology to improve our underlying productivity.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The Treasury is threatening digital companies such as Facebook and Google with a new tax, as it pushes for global agreement on a fairer system for ensuring digital businesses pay their way. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, is expected to use next month\u2019s spring statement to announce the results of a consultation launched by the Treasury in November, on how to update the tax system to reflect the nature of online businesses. The financial secretary to the Treasury, Mel Stride, told the BBC on Thursday that digital companies should pay \u201cfair\u201d levels of tax. He suggested that could mean a system in which tax is levied according to where those companies earn their revenues \u2013 rather than simply taxing profits, which are easier to shift from one jurisdiction to another. \u201cAt the moment [they] are generating very significant value in the UK, typically through having a digital platform with lots of users interacting with that platform,\u201d Stride said. \u201cThat is driving a lot of value, so you\u2019re looking at social media platforms, online marketplaces, internet search engines \u2013 where at the moment the tax regime is not taxing those activities fairly. \u201cWe want to move to a situation where we are taxing those activities fairly.\u201d Treasury sources said the government\u2019s first preference would be to press for reforms to the international system at the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which helps the government coordinate tax policies. But if progress cannot be agreed at a global level, Britain would be prepared to unilaterally enter into various changes, Stride said. Several big digital companies have been criticised in recent years for paying very little tax in the UK, in some cases by engaging in complex avoidance schemes such as shifting the ownership of intellectual property to a low-tax jurisdiction. Facebook recently announced a shakeup in the way it pays tax worldwide, amid mounting public pressure over whether footloose multinationals make a fair contribution to society. The company was criticised for paying just \u00a35.1m in corporation tax in the UK last year, despite revenues nearly quadrupling to \u00a3842.4m on the back of increased advertising sales. Progress on reform at the OECD has been stalled by a division between some nations that would like to see internet firms taxed more heavily and others, such as Luxembourg and Ireland, which value the inward investment they receive by levying low levels of corporation tax. Pascal Saint-Amans, the OECD\u2019s director of tax policy, said recently: \u201cCountries are left with a bitter taste in their mouths because there\u2019s no agreement on taxing profits of digitalised companies.\u201d A recent report from the Royal Society of Arts suggested taxing Amazon, Facebook and Apple more heavily could be one way of paying for a universal basic income, to be paid to all citizens.",

      "bodyText": "And finally, Britain\u2019s stock market clawed back some of its losses to end the day down 29 points, or 0.4%, at 7272 points. That\u2019s partly thanks to a pick-up on Wall Street, where traders welcomed today\u2019s strong weekly jobless figures. City traders have also been digesting today\u2019s UK growth downgrade, and its implications for monetary policy. Fiona Cincotta of City Index explains: UK GDP was revised downwards to 0.4% quarter on quarter, missing expectations of 0.5%. Britain grew just 1.4% year on year making it the slowest growing major economy, lagging behind Italy and Japan, as Brexit uncertainties continue to impact on data. Whilst this isn\u2019t a huge downwards revision, it was sufficient to knock investor confidence over whether the BoE will be able to hike rates as soon as May. The question arises once again as to whether the UK economy is strong enough to sustain a rate rise in the Spring, with so many Brexit uncertainties still unresolved. That\u2019s all for today. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW Here\u2019s our full story on today\u2019s growth figures, by my colleague Angela Monaghan: Britain\u2019s economy grew at a slower rate than first thought in the final three months of 2017, leaving the UK lagging further behind other major economies as it prepares to leave the EU. The Office for National Statistics revised down its estimate for UK growth in the fourth quarter to 0.4%, following an earlier estimate of 0.5% and missing economists\u2019 forecasts that the rate would be unchanged. It said UK production was lower than initially estimated, and said consumers were less willing to spend due to the price rises triggered by the sharp fall in the pound following the Brexit vote. The weaker end to the year weighed on the economy\u2019s performance in 2017 overall, with growth revised down from 1.8% to 1.7% \u2013 the weakest in five years. As the global recovery gathers pace, Britain is falling behind other major economies. The German economy grew by 2.2% in 2017, French GDP increased by 1.9%, and the US economy expanded by 2.3%. \u201cA number of very small revisions to mining, energy generation and services were enough to see a slight downward revision to quarterly growth overall,\u201d said Darren Morgan, a statistician at the ONS. More here: I\u201dll be back later with the closing market report.... The Guardian\u2019s latest Brexit Dashboard is out. This month\u2019s report warns that \u201cCracks are starting to appear in UK economic resilience\u201d, with growth revised down today and yesterday\u2019s jobs figures showing a rise in unemployment. Matt Whittaker of the Resolution Foundation has tweeted about today\u2019s GDP report, explaining how the recovery from the 2008 financial crisis has been so mediocre: Newsflash from America: The number of US citizens signing on for unemployment benefit fell to 222,000 last week, down from 229,000. That\u2019s close to the 45-year low set in January, and shows the US labor market is robust. Back in the financial markets, shares in mobile phone game-maker Rovio Entertainment have taken a real hammering. Shares in Rovio are down 47% after it released a shock profits warning. The firm, famous for its Angry Birds game, now expects to make between \u20ac260m and \u20ac300m this year - analysts had expected \u20ac336. Rovio only floated on the stock market last September, at \u20ac11.50 per share; they\u2019re now worth just \u20ac5.20. Bloomberg pins some of the blame for Britain\u2019s slow economy on the 2016 EU referendum, and the slide in sterling: Part of the economy\u2019s weakness reflects the fallout from the pound\u2019s drop since the vote to leave the EU in 2016. After inflation surged, household spending rose the least in five years in 2017. Professor Costas Milas of the University of Liverpool has created a neat chart, showing how economic uncertainty can hit business investment. The orange line uses newspaper articles in The Times and Financial Times discussing economic policy uncertainty, and shows its deviation from its average over the last three years. You can see how uncertainty spiked in 2016 (after the Brexit vote), just as business investment (blue) declined. Earlier in the decade, though, business investment rose steadily as economic uncertainty declined. Professor Milas explains: Efforts by Ms May to clarify Brexit issues in 2017 have contributed to a 2.1% growth in Business investment (in 2017) following from the disastrous 0.5% drop in 2016. What the graph is really telling us is that Business leaders are crying for additional clarity so that they can invest again! Just in: UK retail sales growth has slowed, for the third month in a row. That\u2019s according to the CBI\u2019s monthly healthcheck on the sector, which found that sales fell across clothing, footwear &amp; leather, department stores, and furniture &amp; carpets. The CBI found that 32% of respondents reported that sales volumes were up on a year ago in February, while 24% said they were down. That giving a balance of +8%, down from +12 in January. On a year-on-year basis, the UK economy grew by 1.4% in the last quarter of 2017. In contrast, the eurozone grew by 2.7%, Germany expanded by 2.9%, France grew by 2.4%, and American GDP rose by 2.5%. Italy grew by a more modest 1.6%. Robert Gordon, CEO of Hitachi Capital UK, is disappointed that UK business investment was flat in the last quarter of 2017. We would like to see businesses taking a more proactive approach to tackling productivity and driving growth through positive investment in key assets over the next few months.\u201d John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC, predicts that the UK will continue to lag behind major economies such as the US and Germany this year. Here\u2019s his take on today\u2019s GDP figures: \u201cThe big picture has not changed. The UK economy is still estimated to have slowed markedly in the first half of 2017 as higher inflation - linked primarily to the weaker pound after the Brexit vote - dampened real household spending power. This factor continued to dampen consumer spending growth in the second half of 2017, but was offset by a stronger world economy, which boosted UK exports in areas like manufacturing and financial and business services. Government spending also provided some support as the Chancellor eased off on austerity, particularly as regards public investment. \u201cAs a result of these factors, UK growth picked up to around 0.4-0.5% per quarter in the second half of 2017 from only around 0.2-0.3% in the first half. But there are signs that growth may have eased off again in January, so we expect UK growth to remain relatively modest at around 1.5% in 2018 as a whole. This would not be disastrous by any means, but would place us towards the bottom of the G7 growth league table together with Italy and Japan, rather than at the top with Germany and the US.\u201d Today\u2019s growth downgrade suggest the UK economy isn\u2019t ready for an interest rate hike, suggests Sam Tombs of Pantheon Macroeconomics. Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, is concerned that the economy remains unbalanced - with the trade deficit widening in the last quarter. Jacob Deppe, Head of Trading at online trading platform, Infinox, says: \u201cThe brief flurry of optimism triggered by December\u2019s breakthrough in Brexit negotiations is looking ever more illusory. \u201cThis downward revision to fourth quarter GDP confirms that Britain\u2019s economy ended 2017 with a whimper rather than a bang. \u201cTo make matters worse, it\u2019s becoming clear that the slowing momentum experienced at the tail end of last year has dragged into the start of 2018. January\u2019s weak retail sales figures, and the news that factory orders fell to a four-month low, all point towards continued weakness in the UK economy. Britain\u2019s economy has just posted its weakest annual growth rate since 2012. This morning\u2019s downgrade in UK growth, to just 1.7% last year, also means the UK is lagging behind other advanced economies. Economist Rupert Seggins points out that Britain has historically done rather better.... City experts are disappointed that Britain\u2019s growth rate in the last quarter has been revised down to 0.4%. Andy Bruce of Reuters says the data is rather worse than expected: Simon French of Panmure Gordon suggests the UK isn\u2019t getting the full benefit of the strengthening global economy. Economist Ulrik Bie fears that household spending will keep being squeezed.. Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, says Britain\u2019s economy is lagging: \u201cThe news comes at a crucial time for Prime Minister Theresa May, who welcomes her top ministers to Chequers for Brexit talks today. With economies on the continent and the eurozone as a whole both performing well at the moment, it\u2019s a tough day for Brexiteers to present their argument, as Britain risks being left behind.\u201d Analysts at Danske Bank says Britain\u2019s traditional growth engines are lagging: In another blow, Britain\u2019s trade deficit widened in the last three months of last year. The ONS explains: In Quarter 4 2017, the net trade deficit widened to \u00a312,237 million in volume terms, from \u00a39,661 million in Quarter 3 2017. This was due in part to large increases in the price of fuels that were imported combined with decreases in the volumes of fuels exported. Total trade imports increased by 1.5% whilst total exports decreased by 0.2%, between Quarter 3 and Quarter 4 2017. Despite the widening of the trade deficit in the latest quarter, looking at 2017 as a whole the trade deficit has narrowed, from \u00a346,912 million in 2016 to \u00a340,404 million in 2017. Today\u2019s growth report shows that UK business investment was flat in the last three months of 2017. That could be a sign that firms are holding back until they have more clarity over Brexit (something Bank of England governor Mark Carney warned of yesterday). Household spending rose by 0.3% during Q4 2017, which means it only grew by 1.8% last year. That\u2019s the lowest rate of annual growth in household spending since 2012. Newsflash: Britain\u2019s economy grew slower than first thought in the final three months of 2017. Uk growth in the fourth quarter of last year has been revised down to 0.4%, from an initial estimate of 0.5%. That\u2019s because the Office for National Statistics has revised downwards its estimated output of the production industries. Annual growth for 2017 as a whole has also been revised down a little, from 1.8% to 1.7%. The ONS says: Growth in the latest quarter was driven by business services and finance within the services sector, there was, though, a small downward revision to services since the preliminary estimate of GDP, but this does not impact on services quarterly growth to one decimal place. Business investment growth was flat between Quarter 3 (July to Sept) and Quarter 4 (Oct to Dec) 2017, but when compared with the same quarter a year ago business investment grew by 2.1%. The ONS has also revised UP its estimate of growth in the third quarter of 2017, from 0.4% to 0.5%. But it\u2019s also revised DOWN growth in the first three months of 2017, from 0.3% to just 0.2%. Speaking of Greece.... Greek MPs have voted to investigate ten of the country\u2019s top politicians, including two prime ministers, over allegations they were bribed by the Swiss drug- maker Novartis for giving the company preferential treatment. Helena Smith reports from Athens: After a marathon 20-hour debate punctured by hostility and abuse, Greek MPs voted to probe all ten of those accused of accepting mammoth bribes from Novartis. Two former finance ministers, including Yiannis Stournaras, the governor of the Bank of Greece, are among the accused. Addressing the 300-seat House, Stournaras described the allegations as false and disgusting saying they amounted to character assassination. \u201cThese false allegations have severely damaged my honour and dignity both among the Greek people and abroad,\u201d he told MPS. \u201cThey undermine the integrity of the country\u2019s central banker.\u201d The claims, outlined by prosecutors originally tipped off by US authorities, involve bribes of as much as \u20ac50m being paid to politicians between 2006 to 2015 to promote Novartis products. The practice is believed to have cost the bankrupt Greek health system around \u20ac4bn. In a midnight speech, the Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras vowed that justice would be done. \u201cWe will not cover up (the scandal),\u201d he told MPs. \u201cThe Greek people must learn who turned pain and illness into a means of enrichment.\u201d In often emotional speeches all of the politicians angrily denied the accusations saying the claims had been deliberately \u201cset up\u201d by Tsipras\u2019 leftist-led coalition. Several have launched legal suits against the anonymous witnesses behind the claims who are now under government protection. Ahead of the vote, EU migration commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos, among those named, told Skai TV: \u201cJustice will speak the moment these bastards who set up this conspiracy find themselves in the dock.\u201d More MPs voted to investigate Avramopoulos, a former health minister, than any other politician also implicated. At a time when it was hoped Greece was finally emerging from economic crisis, investors have been watching nervously. The debt-laden is hoping to return to markets once its final bailout expires in August. Highlighting fears, the main opposition New Democracy leader Kyriakos Mitsotakis asked: \u201cWho will invest in a country with such a toxic political environment.\u201d Greek government bonds are rallying this morning, despite the wider selloff, after Moody\u2019s raised the country\u2019s credit rating by two notches to B3. In a boost for Athens, Moody\u2019s said that it expects Greece to return to self-sufficiency and market-based funding when its bailout ends this summer. This pushed up the price of Greek 10-year debt, sending the yield (or interest rate) down by 15 basis points to 4.3% (from 4.45%). Energy firm Centrica is cutting 4,000 jobs after posting a 17% tumble in adjusted profits. In a contrite statement to the City, Centrica boss Iain Conn admits that 2017 was a rough year. The combination of political and regulatory intervention in the UK energy market, concerns over the loss of energy customers in the UK, and the performance issue in North America have created material uncertainty around Centrica and, although we delivered on our financial targets for the year, this resulted in a very poor shareholder experience. We regret this deeply, and I am determined to restore shareholder value and confidence. Centrica, which operates British Gas, is planning to strip more costs out, in an attempt to boost profitability. And that means that 4,000 jobs will be cut by 2020. Unions are aghast at the plan. UNISON\u2019s national energy officer Matt Lay said: \u201cStaff quite simply will be devastated. Although Centrica has already shed thousands of jobs, it\u2019s nowhere near out of the woods, and there\u2019s much more misery to come. \u201cBritish Gas staff shouldn\u2019t be feeling the heat today. It should be Centrica chief executive Iain Conn. \u201cBritish Gas can\u2019t go on putting the squeeze on its staff and customers. If the company is to survive, it needs first class products, priced competitively to help rebuild its market share, and a genuine strategy for growth. Without this, thousands of UK jobs are at stake, in areas of the country where decent employment can be hard to find. Barclays is defying the selloff, with its shares jumping almost 6% in early trading. Barclays posted a \u00a31.9bn net loss for 2017, dragged into the red by a charge following Donald Trump\u2019s tax reforms. But investors are happy that the bank has pledged to restore its dividend this year. European stock markets are a sea of red in early trading. The FTSE 100 has lost 68 points, or nearly 1%, to 7121 points. It\u2019s being dragged down by mining giants, due to the rise in the US dollar (which pulls down commodity prices). The German DAX is down 0.8%, and the French CAC has lost 0.6%. Not massive losses, but a sign of jitteriness over the prospect of higher US interest rates. Lee Wild, head of equity strategy at interactive investor, says the markets are in a volatile state. Just as it seemed traders had acclimatised to inflation, rising interest rates and higher bond yields, the fears that caused this month\u2019s crash were reignited by minutes from the Federal Reserve\u2019s last meeting. The Dow Jones fell over 470 points, or 1.9% from its mid-afternoon peak as the dollar rallied, making a one-week high against the pound. Economists have been quickly revising their forecasts for US interest rate hikes, following last night\u2019s Fed minutes. Nordea Markets, for example, now expect four hikes in 2018: The prospect of higher American interest rates has sent the US dollar spiking. This has dragged the pound down to $1.388 against the dollar, from over $1.40 earlier this week. Over in Tokyo, a Federal Reserve policymaker has given another hint that US interest rates will rise steadily this year. Fed Governor Randal Quarles says: I anticipate further gradual increases in the policy rate will be appropriate to both sustain a healthy labor market and stabilize inflation around our 2 percent objective. \u201cThe U.S. economy appears to be performing very well and,certainly, is in the best shape that it has been in since the crisis and, by many metrics, since well before the crisis.\u201d Last night\u2019s Fed\u2019s hawkish minutes have sent Japan\u2019s Nikkei down 1%, and wiped 1.3% off the Hong Kong Hang Seng. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. World stock markets are in retreat this morning, after America\u2019s central bank dropped a clear hint that interest rates will rise steadily this year. In the minutes of its last meeting, released last night, the Federal Reserve revealed that several policymakers are more optimistic about the US economy, and have raised their growth forecasts. This suggests they are likely to hike borrowing costs four times this year - more than many in the markets had expected. As the Fed put it: \u201cA majority of participants noted that a stronger outlook for economic growth raised the likelihood that further gradual policy firming would be appropriate.\u201d This send shares sliding on Wall Street, where the Dow lost its earlier gains to finish 166 points lower. Bonds have also been hurt by the prospect of tighter monetary policy, as volatility ripped through the markets again. Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM, explains: Volatility soared in equity and fixed income markets in the final hours of yesterday\u2019s U.S. trading session. After dropping to 17, the Cboe Volatility Index gained 19%, ending the day above 20. The S&amp;P 500 reversed a gain of 1% to end the day 0.55% lower. Similarly, the Dow Jones gave up 470 points from peak-to-trough, while U.S. Treasury yields spiked across the curve, and 10-year yields breached 2.95% for the first time in four years. Over in Asia, most markets are in the red too, and we\u2019re expecting losses in Europe when trading begins. The falls come as the City prepares for the second estimate of UK growth in the final three months of 2017. This will give more detail about how Britain\u2019s economy performed during the quarter; it\u2019ll probably confirm that growth rose to 0.5%.

The UK economy is still estimated to have slowed markedly in the first half of 2017 as higher inflation - linked primarily to the weaker pound after the Brexit vote - dampened real household spending power. This factor continued to dampen consumer spending growth in the second half of 2017, but was offset by a stronger world economy, which boosted UK exports in areas like manufacturing and financial and business services.</p> <p>Government spending also provided some support as the Chancellor eased off on austerity, particularly as regards public investment. </p> <p>\u201cAs a result of these factors, UK growth picked up to around 0.4-0.5% per quarter in the second half of 2017 from only around 0.2-0.3% in the first half. But there are signs that growth may have eased off again in January, so we expect UK growth to remain relatively modest at around 1.5% in 2018 as a whole.

In a midnight speech, the Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras vowed that justice would be done. \u201cWe will not cover up (the scandal),\u201d he told MPs.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cThe Greek people must learn who turned pain and illness into a means of enrichment.\u201d </p> </blockquote> <p>In often emotional speeches all of the politicians angrily denied the accusations saying the claims had been deliberately \u201cset up\u201d by Tsipras\u2019 leftist-led coalition. Several have launched legal suits against the anonymous witnesses behind the claims who are now under government protection. </p> <p>Ahead of the vote, EU migration commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos, among those named, told Skai TV:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cJustice will speak the moment these bastards who set up this conspiracy find themselves in the dock.\u201d </p> </blockquote> <p>More MPs voted to investigate Avramopoulos, a former health minister, than any other politician also implicated.<br></p> <p>At a time when it was hoped Greece was finally emerging from economic crisis, investors have been watching nervously.

      "bodyText": "Men working for Barclays\u2019 international division got paid bonuses that were more than double those of their female colleagues last year, with far fewer women occupying senior roles. Released on the day Barclays slid to a near-\u00a32bn loss, the bank\u2019s 2017 gender pay gap report shows there are big pay gaps between men and women in all three parts of the banking group in the UK. For basic pay excluding bonuses there was a median hourly gap of 43.5% at Barclays International, which includes the investment banking business. In the UK high street bank the gap was 14.2%. This represents the difference between the midpoints in the range of hourly pay for men and women. The gap between men and women was far higher for bonuses \u2013 73% at the international division and nearly 50% at the UK high street business. The 73% gap means that for every \u00a3100,000 of bonuses handed out to men working at Barclays International women were only getting \u00a327,000. Barclays group service, which includes operations and technology, had a salary gap of nearly 30% and a bonus pay gap of 24%. Nicky Morgan MP, Chair of the Treasury Committee, said the size of the Barclays pay gap was shocking: \u201cOn average, women at Barclays International are paid half as much as men. For this to be the case in 2018 is shocking.\u201d She warned that her committee might call financial firms before her committee \u201cto explain any gender pay gap that they may have.\u201d Barclays employs 48,700 people in the UK out of 120,000 worldwide. Barclays said it was \u201cconfident that men and women at Barclays are paid equally for doing the same job\u201d. It said the gender pay gaps were the result of a higher proportion of men occupying more senior roles, especially in investment banking, along with a higher concentration of women in more junior, lower-paid jobs at its bank branches. Many women work part-time or share jobs. Globally, the largest number of Barclays employees (31,406) earned \u00a325,000 or less last year. At the other end of the pay scale, 13,111 staff \u2013 more than one in 10 of the total workforce \u2013 were paid more than \u00a3100,000, including 369 who collected more than \u00a31m and 107 who received more than \u00a32m. \u201cWe know that we have more to do to continue accelerating the progression of women into these more senior roles,\u201d Barclays said in a statement. \u201cWe recognise that tackling the gender pay gap will take time and therefore it is key that we remain focussed on improving gender diversity through a workplace environment and culture that supports and empowers women.\u201d Barclays \u00a32bn loss \u2013 compared with a \u00a31.6bn profit a year ago \u2013 was the result of hefty one-off charges related to Donald Trump\u2019s US corporate tax changes, the cost of exiting Africa, the collapse of Carillion and legal battles. The investment bank still paid out \u00a31.5bn in bonuses and doubled its dividend payout to shareholders. Under UK legislation introduced last year, companies with more than 250 employees have to publish their gender pay gap on an annual basis, withall companies due to report by 5 April. Barclays is one of the first banks to have released its figures. Across the UK economy, the gender pay gap among full-time workers fell to 9.1% last year, the lowest level since records began 20 years ago \u2013 though the TUC warned the UK was still \u201cdecades away\u201d from equal pay for men and women.",

      "bodyText": "KFC is struggling to find charities to which it can donate thousands of tonnes of surplus chicken that has been stored in an unregistered depot during a supply crisis that has closed 160 stores for almost a week, inquiries by the Guardian suggest. On Wednesday, the fast-food chain said it would have to destroy at least some of the chicken at a cold storage facility in Rugby, Warwickshire. It is run by DHL, the company in charge of a troubled supply contract with 900 KFC outlets. The depot is to be registered on Thursday after an emergency visit by Rugby council inspectors on Tuesday. KFC said it was trying to minimise the amount of chicken it will have to destroy as a result of the closures and has approached at least one food charity about the surplus. When asked on Twitter whether the chicken would end up in landfill, KFC said it was trying to minimise wastage. But several charities contacted by the Guardian were reluctant to accept it. FareShare, which fights hunger and food waste, was offered some of the surplus chicken but insisted on safety checks before agreeing to take it. Alyson Walsh, the charity\u2019s commercial director, said: \u201cFareShare only redistributes good-quality, in-date surplus food which has been stored in a robust way.\u201d A spokeswoman for Rugby food bank said: \u201cWe too hate to see food waste, but we only take long-life, ambient food items \u2013 tins and packets. We don\u2019t have freezers.\u201d The Trussell Trust, which runs a network of more than 400 food banks including the one in Rugby, said it had not been contacted by KFC. It would direct any KFC queries to food redistribution charities such as FareShare or FoodCycle, a spokeswoman said. Mary McGrath, the chief executive of FoodCycle, said: \u201cWe don\u2019t use chicken or any meat because it is difficult to handle. If you don\u2019t know what you are doing, you can poison people.\u201d She urged KFC not dump any waste chicken. \u201cThey should be giving it further up the food waste chain,\u201d McGrath said. \u201cThere is a food waste hierarchy: you give to people first, then you give to animals; the next layer down is anaerobic digestion, when it is sent to a digester that will ferment the food and turn into energy, then there\u2019s composting and then you are at landfill.\u201d McGrath suggested donating the surplus chicken to a homelessness charity such as St Mungo\u2019s. A spokeswoman for St Mungo\u2019s said she was not sure whether it could accept a large quantity of surplus KFC chicken. Centrepoint, another homelessness charity, said its local partners would also struggle. \u201cKFC\u2019s heart is obviously in the right place, but most charities do not have the logistical capability to safely transport, store and prepare such a large quantity of fresh food,\u201d said Paul Noblet, its head of public affairs. \u201cKFC could distribute it to its restaurants and cafes throughout the country, and provide free meal vouchers for people in need to access the food through these routes instead.\u201d On Thursday morning, an updated list from KFC showed 692 of its stores were open, leaving 208 still closed. A consumer backlash against KFC has prompted a number of police forces to appeal to people to stop wasting police time on the issue. A KFC spokesperson said: \u201cOver 80% of our restaurants (740 out of 900) are now open, and we can confirm that the backlog of fresh chicken stock at the depot is now cleared. However, due to the ongoing distribution challenges DHL is experiencing, disruption to some restaurants may continue through the weekend, which means some will not be open and others will operate with a reduced menu or shortened hours. \u201cWe\u2019re immensely grateful to our amazing team members and franchise partners who continue to work flat out to get back up and running.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "The Brexit economy: things are starting to deteriorate", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The British economy is showing signs of deteriorating just as the government attempts to reassert its vision for Brexit, according to a Guardian analysis of economic news over the past month that highlights the country\u2019s increasingly fragile position on the world stage. Cracks are beginning to appear in the picture of economic resilience built up during the final months of 2017, when a sustained upswing in global growth helped to lift economic output in Britain. Fresh figures this week also showed the economy grew more slowly than first thought in the final three months of 2017, with GDP growth having been revised down to 0.4% from 0.5% \u2013 putting the UK at the bottom of the G7 league table. Over the past month, the world economy has been rattled by panic in the financial markets, triggered by fears over rising inflation in the US from better-than-expected wage growth. \u201cJust when everything appeared to be going so well [in the world economy], it was time, apparently, for a reality check,\u201d said Stephen King, senior economic adviser at HSBC. As ministers look to use a series of speeches to define the shape of Britain\u2019s post-Brexit relationship with Europe, the Guardian\u2019s monthly tracker of economic news since the EU referendum shows business activity across a broad range of sectors has lost momentum. The number of people out of work increased for the first time in almost two years, pay growth remains below the rate of inflation, and consumer spending staged a limp rebound after a torrid Christmas. But despite signs of weakness, the Bank of England is moving closer to raising interest rates from as early as May, arguing last week that the growth rate for the economy has been lowered by the Brexit vote \u2013 pushing it to raise the cost of borrowing to tackle stubbornly high inflation. The Bank\u2019s governor, Mark Carney, also said the leave result had made people poorer. Writing in the Guardian, David Blanchflower, professor of economics at Dartmouth College and a former MPC member, said the jobs market \u201cturning down\u201d was a sign for Threadneedle Street to put its plans on ice. \u201cYou don\u2019t raise rates, which causes unemployment to go up, when unemployment is already rising. A week is a long time in economics,\u201d he said. To gauge the impact of the Brexit vote on a monthly basis, the Guardian has chosen eight economic indicators, along with the value of the pound and the performance of the FTSE 100. Economists made forecasts for seven of those barometers before their release, and in five cases the outcome was worse than expected. The latest dashboard shows British households coming under significant pressure, as inflation stuck at its highest level for almost six years last month despite expectations for a fall. Stoked by the pound\u2019s weakness since the EU referendum, the rate of growth in prices has been stubbornly high for several months now - although wages are at last beginning to rise. The Bank\u2019s agents suggested British workers are set for the biggest annual pay rise in a decade this year, while pay growth picked-up in January. Meanwhile, average weekly earnings excluding bonuses rose by 2.5% excluding bonuses in the final three months of 2017, up from a rate of 2.3% in the three months ending in November, according to the Office for National Statistics. The global economy helped drag Britain up by the bootstraps at the end of last year, benefiting export-facing businesses who could exploit the weak pound to sell goods and services abroad. However, pay growth is still lagging behind inflation \u2013 damaging consumer spending. Writing in the Guardian, Andrew Sentance, a former member of the Bank of England\u2019s rate-setting monetary policy committee (MPC), said the UK economy is currently feeling the pull of two opposing forces. \u201cThe strength of the global economy and healthy growth in other European economies is boosting growth in export-oriented sectors ... [But] consumers continue to be squeezed by high inflation while Brexit uncertainty is holding back business investment,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "Sterling rallies in bumpy month The pound rallied on foreign exchanges to its highest levels since the Brexit vote in January, although since the end of the month has given up much of its gains amid growing market turbulence. Sterling gained about 3% to hit more than $1.42 as investors bet on a weaker Brexit and the dollar sank after comments in Davos by the US Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, who said a weaker dollar would benefit US trade. Markets have since taken a turn amid rising fears over inflation and higher interest rates. The pound is still worth considerably less than the $1.49 it was prior to the EU referendum. FTSE 100 plunges amid global sell-off Stock markets were plunged into turmoil in early February, bringing to a close a period of zen-like calm and seemingly unstoppable gains over the course of the past year. The FTSE 100 has fallen by almost 500 points over the past month, or about 6%, amid a US bond-market sell-off triggered by fears over rising inflation. The sell-off led stocks to plunge at the fastest rate in more than two years. The International Monetary Fund\u2019s managing director, Christine Lagarde, warned of complacency in Davos earlier in January, arguing that the long period of low interest rates over the past decade had built-up potentially serious vulnerabilities in the financial sector. Now investors reckon rising inflation will need to be countered by rising interest rates \u2013 potentially upsetting the apple cart - and stocks have fallen as a consequence. Worse than forecast Inflation holds steady, keeping pressure on households British households remain under significant pressure, as the rate of inflation stayed at its highest level for almost six years last month. Stoked by the pound\u2019s weakness since the EU referendum, inflation has been stubbornly high for several months, and showed no signs of abating in January, as the consumer price index (CPI) held steady at 3% \u2013 the same level seen in December 2017. Economists had forecast the rate to fall to 2.9% as the sudden fall in the value of sterling begins to fade \u2013 however rising fuel prices at a time of sustained global growth are beginning to offset the dimming influence of the exchange rate on inflation. The Bank of England, which is tasked by the government to keep inflation at 2%, said it would need to raise interest rates somewhat earlier and to a greater extent than previously thought \u2013 which economists reckon could mean an increase in the cost of borrowing from as early as May. Worse than forecast Monthly trade deficit widens despite positive broader trend Hopes of a trade boost for the economy from booming global growth and the weak pound benefiting exporters took a knock last month, as the latest figures show the gap between what Britain imports and sells abroad continued to grow. The total trade in goods and services deficit widened by \u00a31.2bn to \u00a34.9bn in December over the previous month, driven wider by an increase in fuel imports from non-EU countries. Excluding services, the difference between the value of goods brought into the country and sold abroad widened to \u00a313.6bn, making it the worst month since September 2016. Labelled as \u201cpretty poor\u201d by City economists, the figures suggest trade will have acted as a drag on economic growth in the last three months of 2017. Worse than forecast Key industries give weaker signals for economic growth Britain\u2019s dominant services industry grew at its slowest pace in January since the aftermath of the EU referendum, as the economy got off to a sluggish start in 2018. The Markit/CIPS UK Services PMI fell to 53.0 in January from 54.2 in December, its weakest since September 2016 on a scale where anything above 50 indicates growth. Meanwhile, Carillion\u2019s collapse rattled the building industry, where the rate of growth barely pointed to expansion, and even the manufacturing sector \u2013 despite being a key beneficiary of the weak pound and booming global growth \u2013 showed signs of a slowdown last month. Waning demand from consumers, pinched by weak wage growth and rising prices, has been a key problem for the services sector. Brexit uncertainty has hit construction firms, while inflation has eaten into profit margins for manufacturers. Better than forecast Public finances set for best year since 2008 The exchequer is usually in the black in January, due to self-assessed tax returns, but last month was a particularly good start to the year for the chancellor, Philip Hammond. Public sector net borrowing, excluding nationalised banks, was in surplus by \u00a310bn in January \u2013 beating expectations for a surplus of \u00a39.5bn. For the first 10 months of the 2017 financial year, the deficit \u2013 which is the difference between what the government spends and what it brings in from tax receipts \u2013 has fallen by \u00a37.2bn compared with the same period a year ago to \u00a337.7bn \u2013 the lowest figure at this stage of the financial year since 2008. Should the state of the national finances remain broadly similar over the final two months of the fiscal year, borrowing should undershoot the Office for Budget Responsibility\u2019s forecast for the deficit to be \u00a349.9bn, handing the chancellor even more good news when he makes his Spring Statement on 13 March. Worse than forecast Shock unemployment jump, although signs of wages rising The number of people out of work in Britain rose at the fastest rate in almost five years, ending an unbroken two-year period of falls in the jobless rate. Although still close to the lowest levels since the mid 1970s, the shock increase in the unemployment rate to 4.4% in the three months to December from 4.3% in the three months to September will be of cause for concern to policymakers. There was a rise in the number of unemployed by 46,000 to stand at 1.47 million. However, at the same time, the number of people in work also increased, with the employment rate standing at 75.2%, up from 74.6% a year earlier. There was also more positive news for workers\u2019 pay, with figures from the Office for National Statistics showing average weekly earnings excluding bonuses rose by 2.5% in the three months to December \u2013 beating City forecasts for growth to rise slightly to 2.4% from a reading of 2.3% for the three months to November. Worse than forecast Retail sales stage weak rebound from torrid Christmas January was a tough month for high street retailers as sales rose just 0.1%, far below City expectations for a stronger rebound after a torrid Christmas. Economists had forecast a recovery of around 0.5% last month, after the unexpectedly sharp fall of 1.4% in December. The economy will suffer as a result of the weak sales, which come as consumers curb their spending due to inflation pushing up shop prices. The fall in spending has been directly blamed on Brexit, given that the drop in the value of the pond following the EU referendum drove up the cost of importing food and fuel to Britain. Last month, food sales fell again \u2013 down 0.9% in volume terms on December \u2013 although that was offset by a rise in sales of gym kit and children\u2019s toys. Better than forecast Housing market Britain\u2019s housing market got off to a subdued start in 2018, as the number of sales, new buyers, and properties coming onto the market all fell in January. However, the latest monthly snapshot from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) showed that house prices resumed a modest growth trajectory. The survey found national house prices had edged higher, even as agreed sales slipped, with a net balance of +8% of respondents reporting a rise in prices. That was the same reading as seen in December and beat City economists\u2019 forecasts for the barometer to slip to +5%. House prices rose the most in the north west of England, Northern Ireland and Wales, although fell in London, the south-east and the north-east. And another thing we\u2019ve learned this month \u2026 the global economy is showing signs of overheating There are signs from the US, Britain\u2019s largest single trading partner, of the economy starting to overheat, which could be troubling for ministers as the UK prepares to rely more on US trade after Brexit. Figures from the US job market showed wages rising at the fastest annual rate since 2009, as the American economy created 200,000 new jobs last month \u2013 a better performance than had been expected by economists. However, what might on the face of it look like good news was interpreted as a dangerous sign by the financial markets, triggering a massive sell-off as stocks fell at the fastest rate in more than two years. That\u2019s because investors fear stronger pay growth may lead to rising inflation, as companies push-up their prices to offset the impact from rising pay demands. Rising inflation could lead the US Federal Reserve to raise interest rates faster than anticipated and could also damage the economy. The UK exports in the region of \u00a3100bn of goods and services to the US, almost a fifth of the total sold around the world.",

Public sector net borrowing, excluding nationalised banks, was in surplus by \u00a310bn in January \u2013 beating expectations for a surplus of \u00a39.5bn. For the first 10 months of the 2017 financial year, the deficit \u2013 which is the difference between what the government spends and what it brings in from tax receipts \u2013 has fallen by \u00a37.2bn compared with the same period a year ago to \u00a337.7bn \u2013 the lowest figure at this stage of the financial year since 2008. Should the state of the national finances remain broadly similar over the final two months of the fiscal year, borrowing should undershoot the Office for Budget Responsibility\u2019s forecast for the deficit to be \u00a349.9bn, handing the chancellor even more good news when he makes his Spring Statement on 13 March. </p> \n<h2>Worse than forecast</h2> \n<h2>Shock unemployment jump, although signs of wages rising</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"unemployment\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div></div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"wages\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div></div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/22/you-dont-raise-rates-when-unemployment-is-rising-experts-debate-brexit-watch-data\">'You don't raise rates when unemployment is rising' \u2013 experts debate Brexit watch data</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/21/uk-unemployment-rises-at-fastest-rate-in-almost-five-years\">number of people out of work in Britain rose at the fastest rate in almost five years</a>, ending an unbroken two-year period of falls in the jobless rate. Although still close to the lowest levels since the mid 1970s, the shock increase in the unemployment rate to 4.4% in the three months to December from 4.3% in the three months to September will be of cause for concern to policymakers. There was a rise in the number of unemployed by 46,000 to stand at 1.47 million. However, at the same time, the number of people in work also increased, with the employment rate standing at 75.2%, up from 74.6% a year earlier. There was also more positive news for workers\u2019 pay, with figures from the Office for National Statistics showing average weekly earnings excluding bonuses rose by 2.5% in the three months to December \u2013 beating City forecasts for growth to rise slightly to 2.4% from a reading of 2.3% for the three months to November. </p> \n<h2>Worse than forecast</h2> \n<h2>Retail sales stage weak rebound from torrid Christmas</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed element--supporting\" data-alt=\"retail\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div></div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/16/uk-high-street-sales-stagnant-amid-january-retail-gloom\">January was a tough month for high street retailers</a> as sales rose just 0.1%, far below City expectations for a stronger rebound after a torrid Christmas. Economists had forecast a recovery of around 0.5% last month, after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/19/british-shoppers-christmas-spending-official-figures\">unexpectedly sharp fall of 1.4% in December</a>. The economy will suffer as a result of the weak sales, which come as consumers curb their spending due to inflation pushing up shop prices. The fall in spending has been directly blamed on Brexit, given that the drop in the value of the pond following the EU referendum drove up the cost of importing food and fuel to Britain. Last month, food sales fell again \u2013 down 0.9% in volume terms on December \u2013 although that was offset by a rise in sales of gym kit and children\u2019s toys.</p> \n<h2>Better than forecast</h2> \n<h2>Housing market</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed element--supporting\" data-alt=\"rics\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div></div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/08/uk-housing-market-gets-off-to-subdued-start-in-2018-estate-agents-say\">Britain\u2019s housing market got off to a subdued start in 2018</a>, as the number of sales, new buyers, and properties coming onto the market all fell in January. However, the latest <a href=\"https://www.rics.org/Global/1._WEB_%20January_2018_RICS_UK_Residential_Market_Survey_tp.pdf\">monthly snapshot</a> from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) showed that house prices resumed a modest growth trajectory. The survey found national house prices had edged higher, even as agreed sales slipped, with a net balance of +8% of respondents reporting a rise in prices. That was the same reading as seen in December and beat City economists\u2019 forecasts for the barometer to slip to +5%. House prices rose the most in the north west of England, Northern Ireland and Wales, although fell in London, the south-east and the north-east. </p> \n<h2>And another thing we\u2019ve learned this month \u2026 the global economy is showing signs of overheating </h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/feb/2018-02-20T14:31:36/embed.html\" data-alt=\"graph\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/feb/2018-02-20T14:31:36/embed.html\">graph</a> \n</figure> \n<p>There are signs from the US, Britain\u2019s largest single trading partner, of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/14/wobble-on-wall-street-but-what-are-the-underlying-pressures\">economy starting to overheat</a>, which could be troubling for ministers as the UK prepares to rely more on US trade after Brexit. Figures from the US job market showed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/02/us-bond-market-rout-fears-trigger-wall-street-sell-off\">wages rising at the fastest annual rate since 2009</a>, as the American economy created 200,000 new jobs last month \u2013 a better performance than had been expected by economists.

That\u2019s because investors fear stronger pay growth may lead to rising inflation, as companies push-up their prices to offset the impact from rising pay demands. Rising inflation could lead the US Federal Reserve to raise interest rates faster than anticipated and could also damage the economy. The UK exports in the region of \u00a3100bn of goods and services to the US, almost a fifth of the total sold around the world. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2018/02/brexit-dashboard-auto\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2017/07/brexit-dashboard-enhancer/v2\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Guardian business email sign-up\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\n </figcaption> \n</figure>",

    "webTitle": "Ex-Carillion director viewed pension fund as 'waste of money'", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Carillion\u2019s former finance director considered putting cash into the firm\u2019s pension deficit a \u201cwaste of money\u201d, according to the minutes of a meeting written by the pension scheme trustees. The meeting was raised as MPs voiced concerns about Carillion\u2019s attitude to pensions during a parliamentary evidence session in which the Pensions Regulator and accountancy firm KPMG, which audited the firm\u2019s accounts, faced stinging criticism. The regulator said it was investigating whether it could force Carillion bosses to hand back millions of pounds in bonuses to compensate nearly 30,000 pensioners, whose payouts are likely to be cut by up to 15% due to the company\u2019s failure. But it came under fire for a perceived lack of action to force Carillion to pay enough money into the schemes. As MPs questioned officials from the regulator, the work and pensions committee chair, Frank Field, referred to a meeting between trustees and the regulator in 2013, the minutes of which indicate that trustees thought the finance director at the time, Richard Adam, considered pension payments a \u201cwaste of money\u201d. Three witnesses from the regulator said they had not been at the meeting. The regulator\u2019s director of case management, Mike Birch, said it later threatened to impose increased contributions on Carillion, prompting an increase in payments of \u00a385m spread over 15 years. Documents released by MPs earlier in the inquiry showed trustees believed that far more, an extra \u00a330m a year, was necessary to fund the scheme, which has a deficit estimated at nearly \u00a31bn. Field said directors instead chose to pay \u201cmega dividends\u201d and were boasting to the City about doing so. He said: \u201cThey were shovelling money out to themselves, they were shovelling it to shareholders, why didn\u2019t you get them to shovel it to pensioners?\u201d The regulator\u2019s chief executive, Lesley Titcomb, who faced ridicule for failing to remember key figures, said the organisation should in hindsight have done more to extract higher pension contributions from Carillion. Titcomb, who took the job in 2015 after the period in question, said: \u201cWe would not have continued so long in that negotiation situation,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need to be clearer, quicker and tougher. We will change further.\u201d KPMG also came under fire for signing off the 2016 accounts just a few months before Carillion announced \u00a3845m of writedowns and issued a profit warning. The Labour MP Peter Kyle said: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t trust you to audit what\u2019s in my fridge.\u201d The business committee chair, Rachel Reeves MP, referred to the Guardian\u2019s interview this week with a former Carillion executive, who said financial problems were apparent in mid-2016. She said: \u201cInvestors seemed to know, people who worked for the company seemed to know, the only people who didn\u2019t see what was happening were those who were paid to: the directors and the auditors of the company.\u201d Speaking after the evidence session, Field said auditors and regulators were \u201cmere spectators \u2013 commentators at best, certainly not referees \u2013 at the mercy of reckless and self-interested directors\u201d. Reeves said the auditor\u2019s work appeared to be a \u201ccolossal waste of time and money, fit only to provide false assurance to investors, workers and the public\u201d. Peter Meehan, a KPMG partner, said his team had done \u201cthe best we could\u201d, insisting most of Carillion\u2019s problems emerged after he signed off the company\u2019s 2016 accounts in March last year. He also cast doubt on a claim by Carillion\u2019s former chief executive Richard Howson that Qatari firm Msheireb Properties had owed the company \u00a3200m, a claim the Gulf property firm also denies. Meehan added that KPMG, which received more than \u00a329m in fees from Carillion over a decade, warned directors they were at the \u201cmore optimistic\u201d range when assessing the value of their contracts. Separately, Unite raised concerns about \u201cmissing\u201d pension payments it said had been deducted from members\u2019 pay packets before Carillion\u2019s collapse but had not reached the retirement scheme. \u201cWe need to know what has happened to these payments, possibly involving more than \u00a31m,\u201d said the trade union\u2019s national officer for health, Colenzo Jarrett-Thorpe. \u201cAt present, they appear to have mysteriously disappeared into the financial abyss.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Hefty charges related to Donald Trump\u2019s corporate tax changes, the cost of exiting Africa, the collapse of Carillion and legal battles pushed Barclays nearly \u00a32bn into the red last year. Chief executive Jes Staley, who hailed a year of \u201cconsiderable strategic progress\u201d, collected a pay package of \u00a33.9m, down from \u00a34.2m, with his annual bonus cut to \u00a31.07m from \u00a31.3m and benefits also down, while his salary stayed at \u00a32.4m. The group reported an after-tax loss of \u00a31.9bn for 2017, against a net profit of \u00a31.6bn the previous year, largely due to a one-off US tax charge of \u00a3900m and a \u00a32.5bn loss on the sale of the African business. It also took a \u00a3127m hit from the collapse of construction group Carillion. Stripping out these one-off costs, Barclays posted a pretax profit of \u00a33.5bn, up 10%. UK profits were broadly flat at \u00a31.7bn, with income down 2%. The company more than doubled its dividend to 6.5p for 2018 and signalled future share buybacks, sending its share price 5.3% higher. However, Barclays\u2019 corporate and investment bank struggled, with profits sliding 22% to \u00a32.1bn. The firm still paid out bonuses of \u00a31.5bn to its bankers, down just 2% from 2016. Overall staff pay fell to \u00a37.1m from \u00a37.4m. Staley has slashed costs by closing bank branches and laying off thousands of people. The restructuring is now complete, he said. Hargreaves Lansdown analyst, Laith Khalaf, said: \u201cRevenues at the UK bank have actually flatlined, while the international division is flagging. In particular the investment bank looks like a casino where the house isn\u2019t winning. Revenues fell despite an appreciation in the dollar last year, which doesn\u2019t bode well for the weaker dollar environment we now find ourselves in.\u201d Barclays set aside \u00a31.2bn to cover costs from fines and litigation, including \u00a3700m for payment protection insurance (PPI), taking its total bill related to the PPI mis-selling scandal to \u00a39.1bn. The FCA has just started an investigation into Barclays\u2019 debt collections in relation to unsecured lending from July 2015 and \u201cwhether or not it paid due consideration to the interests of customers in default and arrears\u201d. Staley said the bank had made good progress in putting most of its legal battles behind it, including the PPI and Libor scandals. This leaves two major issues: Barclays\u2019s fight with the Department of Justice (DOJ) in the US courts over a decade-old mortgage bond mis-selling scandal; and the group\u2019s dealings with Qatar during its emergency fundraising in 2008, which are being investigated by the UK\u2019s Serious Fraud Office, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and US authorities. The SFO is investigating a $3bn loan provided by Barclays in November 2008 to the state of Qatar, at a time when Qatari and other investors bought shares in the bank to prop it up at the peak of the financial crisis. The SFO has also charged Barclays\u2019 parent company, its ex-chief executive, John Varley, and three former senior bankers with offences linked to the bank\u2019s \u00a311.8bn emergency fundraising. A trial is due to begin next January. If found guilty, the bank could face regulatory penalties, including withdrawal of its banking licences. This would not affect Barclays\u2019 UK high street operations because they are being transferred to a new company as part of the ringfencing of retail banking in Britain. However, investment banking, corporate lending and international operations would be hit. Staley said Barclays hoped to resolve both issues \u201cin due course\u201d. Staley himself is under investigation by the FCA, the City watchdog, and the Bank of England\u2019s Prudential Regulation Authority for trying to unmask a whistleblower within Barclays\u2019 staff. The bank had said his bonus would be \u201cvery significantly cut\u201d. Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, said: \u201cStaley\u2019s future remains a doubt ... Meanwhile, a far more serious threat looms in the shape of the SFO\u2019s investigation into Barclays\u2019 2008 emergency fundraising.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Centrica, the owner of British Gas, will shed a further 4,000 jobs by 2020 as part of a cost-cutting programme, which it blamed on the government\u2019s energy price cap and fierce competition in the market. Britain\u2019s largest energy company reported on Thursday a fall of 17% in operating profit to \u00a31.25bn in 2017, owing to poor performance in its business energy supply and North America divisions. Iain Conn, the Centrica chief executive, said: \u201cThe only thing I regret is we are going to see 4,000 more colleagues leaving Centrica and it\u2019s partly due to this price cap and competitive pressures.\u201d The majority of the 4,000 jobs lost will be in the UK, where 30,000 of its 35,000-person global workforce are based. The first thousand will go this year through natural attrition and compulsory redundancies. The new cuts of 4,000 staff are on top of an existing plan to reduce headcount by 5,500 by 2020, which will be partly offset by the creation of 2,000 jobs, so total losses are set to be 7,500. Conn refused to rule out additional job losses under the cost-cutting plan, which has deepened from \u00a3750m to \u00a31.25bn a year. Matt Lay, the national energy officer at the union Unison, said: \u201cAlthough Centrica has already shed thousands of jobs, it\u2019s nowhere near out of the woods, and there\u2019s much more misery to come. \u201cBritish Gas staff shouldn\u2019t be feeling the heat today. It should be Iain Conn.\u201d GMB, the union for gas workers, said the job cuts were an inevitable part of a \u201cfailing plan\u201d implemented by Conn. National officer Stuart Fegan said: \u201cIain Conn must immediately learn from the failure of other, now departed, battlefield generals that you cannot cut your way out of a crisis \u2013 GMB will fight these unnecessary job cuts.\u201d British Gas lost about 750,000 customers, 10% of its total, over the year. However, Conn argued that the company was resilient and more than half of the accounts were loss-making, so the impact was limited. British Gas made a profit margin per customer of 5.5%, or \u00a359 out of a typical \u00a31,101 dual fuel bill. The government\u2019s price cap is expected by the end of the year and will limit the bills of millions of British Gas customers on standard variable tariffs. Conn admitted this would dent profit margins. The company also faces a new rival in the form of a merged npower and SSE, as well as new entrants with financial muscle such as Shell, which bought First Utility last year. Despite these threats, Conn said he was confident things would get better, citing the company\u2019s strategy, cashflow and balance sheet. \u201cI don\u2019t agree the worst is yet to come, I believe the best is yet to come,\u201d he said. The company had warned last November of a weak performance in the second half of 2017, which was laid bare in the results announced on Thursday. Operating profit at the unit that supplies energy to businesses was down 67% to \u00a3161m. Its consumer energy supply arm dropped 1% to \u00a3890m, despite a price cap on 4 million vulnerable households and warmer weather. Conn said he was considering management changes at Centrica\u2019s North American division. He said he deeply regretted the overall impact on shareholders, who saw the share price fall more than 40% last year. The company also announced that by 2020, it would sell its 20% stake in EDF Energy Nuclear Generation, which owns Britain\u2019s existing eight nuclear power stations. \u201cWe are not a natural owner and it\u2019s a minority stake with limited control,\u201d said Conn, adding that buyers might include infrastructure funds. The company\u2019s share price rose 4.46% to 138.10p, which was seen as a result of Centrica pledging to keep shareholder dividends steady. Analysts at Hargreaves Lansdown said cost-cutting would help, but overall, political pressure and rising competition meant the company faced \u201cmore headwinds than tailwinds\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "A powerful committee of MPs is launching an inquiry into bitcoin and other digital currencies over fears that cryptocurrencies could lead to increased \u201cmarket volatility, money laundering and cybercrime\u201d. The Treasury select committee said the inquiry would \u201cexamine the potential impact of distributed ledger technology \u2013 such as blockchain \u2013 on financial institutions, including the central bank, and financial infrastructure\u201d. Nicky Morgan, chair of the Treasury committee, said the inquiry was needed to investigate the risks consumers face if they invest in bitcoin, the price of which has fluctuated wildly. \u201cPeople are becoming increasingly aware of cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, but they may not be aware that they are currently unregulated in the UK, and that there is no protection for individual investors,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Treasury committee will look at the potential risks that digital currencies could generate for consumers, businesses and governments, including those relating to volatility, money laundering and cybercrime.\u201d The inquiry comes after the prime minister called for her government to have a \u201cvery serious\u201d look at potential regulation of cryptocurrencies because of \u201cthe way they are used, particularly by criminals\u201d. Theresa May was one of several global leaders to warn about the potentials dangers of bitcoin and other digital currencies at the World Economic Forum in Davos last month. Steven Mnuchin, the US treasury secretary, said: \u201cMy number one focus on cryptocurrencies, whether that be digital currencies or bitcoin or other things, is that we want to make sure that they\u2019re not used for illicit activities.\u201d France\u2019s and Germany\u2019s finance ministers have called on fellow G20 leaders to introduce coordinated regulation, and have put cryptocurrencies on the agenda for this year\u2019s G20 summit in Argentina in November. In a letter to their counterparts the finance ministers warned that cryptocurrencies were \u201clargely mislabelled as \u2018currencies\u2019 in the media\u201d. French president Emmanuel Macron has called for the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to oversee investigations into cryptocurrencies. Christine Lagarde, the IMF\u2019s managing director, said that it had already begun \u201cmonitoring and surveilling and analysing the risks associated with the development of cryptocurrencies and the potential benefits out of it\u201d. She said that the lack of transparency in cryptocurrencies\u2019 transactions \u201cconceals and protects money-laundering and financing of terrorism and all sorts of dark trades\u201d. Bitcoin, Ether and other cryptocurrencies have soared in value attracting millions of people to buy in. However, experts have warned that prices could collapse and leave investors with nothing. Bitcoin was trading at about $10,600 on Wednesday, down from a high of nearly $20,000 in December 2016, but far higher than the $1,000 the virtual coins were worth at the start of 2017. Morgan said the committee would consider whether the currencies should be subject to regulation. It will also scrutinise the government, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and Bank of England\u2019s regulatory response to the emergence of the new currencies. \u201cStriking the right balance between regulating digital currencies to provide adequate protection for consumers and businesses, while not stifling innovation, is crucial,\u201d Morgan said. \u201cAs part of the inquiry, we will explore how this can be achieved.\u201d The inquiry will also explore potential benefits of cryptocurrencies and how they \u201ccould disrupt the economy and replace traditional means of payment\u201d. Morgan has not bought any cryptocurrencies herself, but has said some of her constituents are keen investors.",

      "bodyText": "The latest review of Australia\u2019s economy by the International Monetary Fund has a much less rosy outlook for the next few years than does the government\u2019s budget papers. And in light of the latest release of wages price data showing continued weak wages growth, the IMF crucially predicts much lower wages growth than does the budget \u2013 a factor which creates a major risk to the government\u2019s hopes for a return to surplus by 2021. The IMF\u2019s report of the state of Australia\u2019s economy overall is generally praising of our performance. It noted the \u201crobust economic performance during the rebalancing of the economy in the wake of the mining investment boom of the 2000s\u201d. Effectively the shift from the boom through the GFC and now into the export phase of the mining boom is given a tick. But whereas the budget papers only look ahead four years to 2020-21, the IMF projects out to the end of 2023, and what they project is generally less optimistic than that of the treasury. The latest figures from the mid-year fiscal and economic outlook expected Australia\u2019s economy to grow by 3% from 2018-19 onwards; the IMF however sees growth of 3.1% in 2019, but then slowing below 3% after that until reaching 2.6% by 2023: The IMF certainly does not see another mining boom around the corner. It projects iron ore and coal prices to fall slightly from the current levels, with no anticipation of an increase out to 2023. As a result the size of mining investment is predicted to remain around 2.6% of GDP \u2013 well below the 8.5% it achieved in 2013: And while the IMF at least sees no dire straits ahead \u2013 although, rarely does the IMF ever predict a recession \u2013 it does anticipate some risks. For Australia the risks are primarily with the ability of the budget to return to a surplus and in the housing market. As I have noted ever since last year\u2019s budget was handed down, the government\u2019s predictions for wages growth are rather heroic. On Wednesday the latest figures showed overall wages growth improving slightly from 2.0% to 2.1%, while the budget predicts by June this year wages will be growing by 2.25%, and by June next year at 2.75% before hitting 3.25% by June 2020. Such an improvement accounts for a large level of the budget\u2019s income tax revenue figures, and the basis for the budget return to surplus. The IMF, rather than seeing a relatively quick return to average wages growth of around 3.5% as the budget does, instead has wages growing below 3% through until the end of 2023: As such the IMF notes that because the budget\u2019s projections are reliant upon \u201cincome bracket creep for personal income tax collection\u201d, the \u201crisk is that with a gradual recovery, the rebound to trend nominal growth might not be as rapid.\u201d Should wages \u2013 and other areas of the economy \u2013 not grow as fast in nominal terms (ie due to low inflation and wages growth), then the IMF notes that this poses \u201crisks to spending envelopes supporting macrostructural reforms, including infrastructure spending\u201d. And the IMF is clear that infrastructure spending has been a major factor in the improvement of the economy in the past year. And while it notes such spending has narrowed the \u201cinfrastructure gap\u201d, it recommends that \u201cfurther infrastructure spending increases should be considered.\u201d And it also sees less drive coming from the housing sector than has been the case. While the IMF continues to argue the Reserve Bank should maintain low interest rates over the short term it does see rates rising slightly over the next two years. By the end of next year, it predicts the cash rate to have risen from the current 1.5% to 2.0%, and will again rise to 2.5% by the end of the decade. It also forecasts a strong slowdown in the rise in house prices. And while it anticipates a \u201csoft landing\u201d (again, the IMF rarely predicts a housing crash) it does not see the level of house prices relative to incomes falling back to the level they were before the IMF began cutting rates in 2011: We can also add the IMF to the list of those who argue that negative gearing causes house prices to rise. The report has strong words about negative gearing and the 50% capital gains discount. It notes that such \u201cpreferential tax treatment of home ownership and investment\u201d distorts the housing market and investment choices. It notes that these two policies \u201cfavour residential real estate relative to many other investments, supporting higher demand and valuation relative to a counterfactual of no or lower tax preferences\u201d. It views these imbalances as one of the risks inherent in our economy. As ever in such reports, the IMF recommends the removal of stamp duty along with improved supply-side policies such as reforms to zoning and planning at a local and state level that \u201cpromote efficient use of land in denser urban settings.\u201d But while the IMF does predict lower economic and wages growth than does the budget, one area it is more positive is unemployment. Whereas the budget sees unemployment falling no further than 5.25% over the next three years, the IMF predicts a rate of 5.0% by the end of 2020. In essence the picture the IMF paints is thus one consistent with the new normal \u2013 weaker economic growth, housing affordability still above where it was a decade ago, and while employment prospects are good, the likelihood of a wage rise are not.",

      "bodyText": "Carillion was in serious financial difficulty by the middle of 2016 but directors were \u201cplacating the City\u201d by failing to disclose major problems, according to a former executive at the collapsed government contractor. Speaking on condition of anonymity, an executive who spent more than 20 years with the company lifted the lid on a corporate culture in which \u201cnobody wanted to give bad news\u201d. \u201cAnyone in the business knew there were major problems, even middle managers,\u201d the former Carillion executive told the Guardian. \u201cThe supply chain wasn\u2019t being paid, money was getting transferred [between different parts of the group] to pay salaries, loans were coming in from the UK to the whole of the Middle East. By mid-2016 we were already seeing these problems.\u201d He added: \u201cThe philosophy was that it would be all right on the night and it got to a point where people wouldn\u2019t listen to you if you weren\u2019t on message.\u201d The latest revelations came on the eve of a parliamentary evidence session at which MPs conducting an inquiry into Carillion will question representatives of the firm\u2019s auditor, KPMG, about why the accountancy group did not spot the company\u2019s financial problems sooner. In testimony before MPs on two select committees this month, former Carillion chief executive Richard Howson has said Carillion\u2019s problems crystallised after KPMG reviewed its contracts in spring 2017, leading to writedowns of \u00a3845m and a profit warning that began the company\u2019s death spiral. But the former Carillion executive, who has spent most of his career with the company, said major problems were apparent long before that but were kept \u201con the back burner\u201d. \u201cFor them [directors] to say it all happened in April and May 2017 when the world changed \u2026 it\u2019s absolute nonsense.\u201d \u201c[The writedowns] were all lurking and developing, they had even crystallised, but nobody was accepting it. There was no cash.\u201d The Financial Conduct Authority, the City watchdog, is investigating the \u201ctimeliness and content\u201d of Carillion\u2019s stock market announcements between 7 December 2016 and 10 July 2017, a period that includes its annual results for 2016. The former Carillion executive said he believed that these results painted an unrealistic picture of the company\u2019s financial health. \u201cAll we were doing was placating the City all the time, saying it was all OK, keeping the share price up.\u201d \u201cThe hedge funds didn\u2019t believe it, they were all over it,\u201d he added, a reference to major bets taken by investment firms that were short-selling Carillion, effectively placing bets that its share price would fall. He said he considered becoming a whistleblower by flagging up his concerns with a non-executive member of the board but was concerned at what result this might have. The source also disputed Howson\u2019s argument that a major factor in Carillion\u2019s demise was its inability to collect a \u00a3200m debt owed by Qatari client Msheireb for work redeveloping the country\u2019s capital, Doha, ahead of the World Cup 2022. Howson has previously said he \u201cfelt like a bailiff\u201d when trying to collect the debt. \u201cThe reality is that there was a big dispute and these things happen,\u201d said the source. \u201cJust because you fly out and ask for money, doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re entitled to it. You can only be a bailiff if the money is owed, not if you feel it\u2019s owed.\u201d Msheireb, a property company which has already denied allegations by former Carillion directors, said Howson\u2019s claims were \u201cmisleading and inaccurate\u201d, adding that they had provided supporting evidence to the business select committee. \u201cMsheireb Properties is deeply saddened that Carillion collapsed affecting so many employees, pensioners, subcontractors and projects in the United Kingdom and around the world,\u201d it said. \u201cHowever, the attempt by current and former executives of Carillion to pass the blame to others, including Msheireb Properties, was deeply troubling and inaccurate.\u201d The company added that it was \u201ccurrently exploring all legal options\u201d. Fresh revelations about Carillion\u2019s collapse came as MPs released evidence showing that problems with the Royal Liverpool University Hospital were discovered nine months before the company took a writedown related to the project. Frank Field, the work and pension committee chair, said the discovery of cracked beams, which delayed the project, were \u201ca perfect parable for the whole company: the cracks were visible long before the directors or auditors admit\u201d.",
