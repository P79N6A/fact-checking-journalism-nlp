    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The deal is still to be signed, but already some extraordinary claims are being made about Hinkley Point in Somerset, which will be the first nuclear plant to be built in the UK since 1995. Here's chancellor George Osborne's take: \"If it wasn't Chinese investment or French investment, it would have to be the British taxpayer. I would rather British taxpayers were spending their money on our schools and hospitals and those things, and let's get the rest of the world investing in our energy.\" Put like that, you might assume UK taxpayers have hit the jackpot, that EDF of France and China General Nuclear Power Corporation (CGNPC) will bear all the financial risks and that energy bills in the UK are bound to fall sometime around 2020 as cheap nuclear energy comes on stream. Forget it. The UK will be agreeing to buy electricity from Hinkley Point for 35-40 years at \u00a393 per megawatt hour or thereabouts, according to the whisper from Westminster. That is roughly twice the current market rate for electricity, and far in excess of the \u00a340 per megawatt hour that was airily waved around by the Department of Energy only half a decade ago. Nuclear power, it seems, can only be bought at a cost roughly equivalent to on-shore wind, complete with its subsidies to landowners. Maybe that is the price that has to be paid for secure low-carbon supplies, but at current energy prices, the first impact of Hinkley Point will be to add to consumers' bills, just as wind does today. \"In the long term,\" the chancellor continued, new nuclear should lead to \"lower and more stable energy bills.\" The key phrase there is \"long term\". The claim rests on the assumption that the costs of other sources of energy will continue to rise and make \u00a393 appear a bargain sometime in the future. That assumption may or may not prove correct \u2013 but coming from a government that supposedly thinks fracking will revolutionise the energy market, it's a strange argument to hear. But is \u00a393 the real cost anyway? The devil will be in the detail of this contract \u2013 specifically, in the indexation formula for the strike price. If Hinkley Point's entire output is tied to the rate of inflation for 40 years, we could be staring at a truly astronomical cost by the end of the contract. \"The government surely can't be that dumb,\" comments one City analyst. One assumes not. But what proportion of Hinkley Point's operating costs and uranium purchases will inflate automatically? The answer is critical to any assessment of value for money. So, too, is the size of the loan guarantees given to EDF and the Chinese. If they amount to 70% of the debt raised to fund the \u00a314bn construction costs of two reactors, the UK taxpayer is firmly on the hook. And, given that EDF's recent construction experience in France is massive cost over-runs, is the UK backstopping that risk as well? The Department of Energy and Climate Change refuses to comment until the talks are completed, but Steve Thomas, professor of energy policy at the University of Greenwich, has a blunt assessment of where negotiating power lies: EDF has the government \"over a barrel\" and the contract may be an \"absolute disaster\" for taxpayers. Strictly speaking, judgment must be reserved until the contract is signed and published. But Osborne's Chinese spin should make us nervous. How is it meant to be good news that, among all the possible sources of capital to partner EDF at Hinkley Point, we have ended up with a company controlled by the Chinese Communist party? Remember the history here. Centrica, the UK's supposed energy champion, dropped out of the EDF-led consortium, preferring to take a \u00a3200m hit than continue down a nuclear path where the costs and risks only ever seem to increase. In the face of homegrown scepticism, guarantees from the UK taxpayer have now persuaded Beijing to climb aboard. This does not sound like a triumph in the making. It sounds instead like the latest instalment in the 30-year saga of the UK's shambolic and short-termist energy policy. Cable's defence of Royal Mail price doesn't wash It's onwards and upwards for Royal Mail's shares. A price of 500p was passed on Friday, completing a 50% advance from the flotation price of 330p a week ago. Still, at least business secretary Vince Cable is now trying to explain why the government sold at a price that looks a gross under-valuation. One of his arguments is that the Communication Workers Union soured sentiment among City investors by calling a strike ballot. Sorry, but this doesn't wash for a couple of reasons. First, as Cable's letter to the business select committee states, Royal Mail's management concluded \"in the second half of August\" that a ballot was likely. So, if the government really deemed the threat of a strike to be a game-changer, it could have delayed a float that was finally announced only on 12 September. After all, the public commitment at the time was only to complete the privatisation by spring 2014. Second, City investors were bound to jump on any excuse to lobby for low pricing. Behind the scenes though, few investors regard strike action, which has now been called, as a life or death struggle for Royal Mail. The calculation remains that the CWU's hand is weak since the offer of a pay rise of 8.6% over three years will look good in the eyes of, say, NHS nurses. The business select committee, when it cross-examines Cable and government adviser Lazard, should stick to the heart of the matter: demand for shares from institutions was strong at 330p, so how hard did the government push for a higher price to protect the public purse? An assessment \"of where demand would taper off\" was made, Cable says, adding: \"A number of the key long-only accounts expressed concern over the possibility that the top of the range might be revised above 330p.\" Well, yes, the institutions would say that, wouldn't they? The job of Lazard and bookrunners Goldman and UBS was to establish whether this \"concern\" was bluster. The MPs should keep pressing. Is tax too taxing for Barclays' finance director? If you are the group finance director of a major bank, filing your tax return ought to be a doddle \u2013 a minor chore to be completed in a couple of hours on a wet Sunday evening. So why does Tushar Morzaria, Barclays' new finance director, need an annual allowance of \u00a325,000 to cover the cost of help in filing his return? The entitlement was a curious detail in Morzaria's contract revealed on these pages this week. OK, the new recruit is coming from the US, which may complicate his employment status. But for \u00a325k, you could hire a senior partner in a leading accountancy firm for a few days. Can it be that complicated? The explanation, apparently, is that the arrangement is par for the course among international companies whose executives have to work in more than one country. The employer doesn't want the embarrassment of a big cheese failing to pay the right amount of tax. The good news for Barclays shareholders is that the allowance lasts for only three years. After that, the bank's top numbers man will have to conquer HMRC's website all by himself. No, Ahrendts is not 'transitioning' Sound advice from Terry Smith in his latest dispatch to investors in his Fundsmith fund: be wary of management gobbledygook, because it usually represents \"a combination of woolly thinking and a desire to disguise or divert attention from a problem\". He cites the example of US retailer Walmart, which used the term \"leverage\" 80 times in a recent results presentation. One could offer other examples. Try the headline on this week's announcement from Burberry: \"Angela Ahrendts transitions from Burberry.\" No, Ahrendts is not transitioning \u2013 she has quit to join Apple. \"This CEO transition is a natural progression,\" continued chairman Sir John Peace. He sounds overly anxious to claim that the promotion of chief designer Christopher Bailey, who will retain his old job as well as succeeding Ahrendts, represents business as usual. No wonder Burberry investors are alarmed.",

The point is that the British government is guilty of Orwellian doublespeak. On one hand, we're told the Chinese are a threat to British interests with their industrial-scale hacking, yet George Osborne claims that paving the way for the Chinese to play a dominant role in the UK nuclear industry is a triumph for his diplomacy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-420387771\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/18/1382116772813/Gary-Neill-002.jpg\" alt=\"Gary Neill\" width=\"200\" height=\"244\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Illustration by <a href=\"http://garyneill.com/\">Gary Neill</a></span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The fact is that, post-privatisation, the energy sector was starved of investment for years. Our infrastructure is creaking and the government has to go cap-in-hand to the Chinese begging for money. Far from being a triumph of Osborne's diplomatic skills, British weakness has been laid bare. We are now utterly dependent on foreign state-owned companies to keep the lights on. Chinese companies already own large chunks of our gas, electricity and water infrastructure. The government's disastrous energy policy means it had an almost nonexistent negotiating hand in China. The GMB is pragmatic and recognises that the investment is desperately needed. But we see no sign of Osborne securing any guaranteed benefits for UK manufacturing. Meanwhile, the Chinese manufacturing supply chain and nuclear industries will benefit from having a controlling interest in the UK nuclear industry.<br><strong>Gary Smith</strong><br><em>National secretary, GMB commercial services section</em></p> <p>\u2022 The UK chancellor has just signed up to a deal where EDF and the Chinese get \u00a314bn just for the construction of Hinkley C. The UK government has also promised profits to the French and Chinese with a guaranteed price which is twice the existing cost, beginning in 2025 for 35 more years, after which they walk away from the UK with their profits and leave all the waste behind for thousands of years. By 2025, electricity costs in the UK will already be lower than today's costs, as wind, wave, solar and tidal power become established and their initial development costs recovered (see Germany's success).</p> <p>For nuclear, the taxpayers will also pay for the waste and decommissioning \u2013 \u00a3100bn and counting just for legacy waste.

      "bodyText": "You quote a leader from the GMB (Nuclear expert raises fears over Chinese role in atomic plants, 18 October) as suggesting it is almost Orwellian to allow Chinese investment into our highly sensitive energy infrastructure, given that China has been linked to corporate hacking. The point is that the British government is guilty of Orwellian doublespeak. On one hand, we're told the Chinese are a threat to British interests with their industrial-scale hacking, yet George Osborne claims that paving the way for the Chinese to play a dominant role in the UK nuclear industry is a triumph for his diplomacy. The fact is that, post-privatisation, the energy sector was starved of investment for years. Our infrastructure is creaking and the government has to go cap-in-hand to the Chinese begging for money. Far from being a triumph of Osborne's diplomatic skills, British weakness has been laid bare. We are now utterly dependent on foreign state-owned companies to keep the lights on. Chinese companies already own large chunks of our gas, electricity and water infrastructure. The government's disastrous energy policy means it had an almost nonexistent negotiating hand in China. The GMB is pragmatic and recognises that the investment is desperately needed. But we see no sign of Osborne securing any guaranteed benefits for UK manufacturing. Meanwhile, the Chinese manufacturing supply chain and nuclear industries will benefit from having a controlling interest in the UK nuclear industry. Gary Smith National secretary, GMB commercial services section \u2022 The UK chancellor has just signed up to a deal where EDF and the Chinese get \u00a314bn just for the construction of Hinkley C. The UK government has also promised profits to the French and Chinese with a guaranteed price which is twice the existing cost, beginning in 2025 for 35 more years, after which they walk away from the UK with their profits and leave all the waste behind for thousands of years. By 2025, electricity costs in the UK will already be lower than today's costs, as wind, wave, solar and tidal power become established and their initial development costs recovered (see Germany's success). For nuclear, the taxpayers will also pay for the waste and decommissioning \u2013 \u00a3100bn and counting just for legacy waste. Taxpayers will also pay all nuclear insurance costs, from construction to onsite spent fuel storage, for thousands of years. It's not rocket science; it's not even secondary school maths. We're being conned by false threats of the lights going out and outright lies that nuclear is carbon free. And let's not even start on the health costs \u2013 yet another example of international government cover ups which make Nineteen Eighty-Four read like a fairy tale. Jo Brown Burnham-on-Sea, Somerset \u2022 The Royal Academy of Engineering study, GB Electricity Capacity Margin, highlights the need to act now to avoid energy shortfalls. This report looks at a worst-case scenario where everything that could go wrong does go wrong all at the same time. The report highlights the need to facilitate a rapid move to deployment of new large-scale electricity generation to avoid supply shortfalls over the next 10 years, and also to enable the transition to a low-carbon energy system.

He has taken a swipe at the \u201ctroika\u201d of creditors propping up the country\u2019s debt-stricken economy.Helena reports from Athens:</p> <blockquote> <p>For the first time since he was elevated to the post of finance minister, the economics professor Yannis Stournaras has issued a broadside that appears to be directly aimed at Greece\u2019s foreign lenders. Emerging from talks with prime minister Antonis Samaras, the Oxford-educated academic gave reporters a taste of the frustration currently bedevilling the country\u2019s ties with its creditors.</p> <p>\u201cThe government cannot accept opinions which seem to undermine not only the efforts of the Greek people but primarily the improvement that we have of all the indicators in the Greek economy,\u201d he said. Clearly piqued, the technocrat then listed the achievements saying:&#xa0;\u201clike investment, foreign interest, spreads and so on.\u201d</p> <p>With the troika pushing for more austerity measures to cover a funding gap that it estimates will be \u20ac2bn next year, the ruling coalition is feeling the heat \u2013 and becoming increasingly determined to show that it means what it says when it insists that the Greeks cannot take any more cuts. Stournaras\u2019 outburst highlights the government\u2019s decision to toughen its stance ahead of visiting troika mission chiefs returning to Greece at the end of the month.</p> </blockquote> <p>With that we are closing the live business blog for today and will be back on Monday.

AIA reported record quarterly results and said its new business rose by 26%. Traders said Prudential was benefiting since it had a strong presence in the region. The insurance sector was also helped by reports that an EU requirement on the amount of capital companies need to hold could be less onerous than initially suggested.</p> <p>Overall, it was a week of record highs, with <strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/royal-mail\">Royal Mail</a></strong>, Google, Germany's Dax index and America's S&amp;P 500 all reaching new peaks.</p> </blockquote> <p>Read his full market report here:</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/marketforceslive/2013/oct/18/ftse-100-rises-us-debt-ceiling-china-prudential\">FTSE climbs to one month high on US relief and Chinese data</a></h2> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-526164f2e4b0ebb74892f455\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-18T16:52:42.119Z\">5.52pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Data flood ahead</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-e281169a-2076-4934-8c9b-597d0908bc14\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/18/1382114920832/3c906e26-61ac-4b2e-af92-a32ac7b40b34-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"High seas at Seaham Harbour, County Durham.

In Germany, we get the Ifo business survey on Friday and eurozone PMIs on activity across the region are out on Thursday.</p> <p>In the United States, after the shutdown held back some key data from government departments, there is a flood coming next week, top of the bill <strong>non-farm payrolls on Tuesday. </strong>Also due out in the US are: exisiting home sales on Monday, import and export price figures on Wednesday, durable goods orders on Friday.</p> <p>Taking a closer look at the data highlights ahead (all forecasts from Reuters polls of economists):</p> <p><strong>Tuesday</strong><br>US non-farm payrolls data (originally scheduled for October 4 release) are expected to show the world\u2019s largest economy added 180,000 jobs in September after 169,000 reported for August - though that forecast is from a poll before the data delay.</p> <p>UK public finances data are also out on Tuesday.</p> <p><strong>Wednesday</strong><br>Minutes from the Bank of England\u2019s latest policy meeting are expected to show the nine-member monetary policy committee was unanimous in its decision to leave interest rates at their record low of 0.5% and not to extend quantitative easing (QE).</p> <p><strong>Thursday</strong><br>PMIs from the eurozone are out.</p> <p>Alan Clarke, economist at Scotiabank sums up his view for the region:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Last week\u2019s data provided encouraging signs that the eurozone recovery is continuing. First, hard data on the supply side printed stronger than expected. Indeed, eurozone industrial production rose by 1.0% m/m in August while the very depressed July numbers were revised up. Second, the early survey indicators for October, namely the German ZEW index, moved further up suggesting that the appreciation in the EUR exchange rate has not yet reached the pain threshold which could derail the eurozone recovery. The ZEW survey is not the most reliable indicator, so there is no room for complacency. This week\u2019s business surveys will be much more important with the release of eurozone PMIs (Thurs), German Ifo (Fri) and French INSEE (Wed) surveys.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Friday</strong><br>Economists expect growth of 0.8% on the quarter from the UK in the third quarter when the Office for National Statistics publishes its first take on the July-September period. That compares with 0.7% in the second quarter. Forecasts range from 0.5% to 1.0%.<br>Philip Shaw, economist at Investec says an upside surprise on his 0.8% call is entirely possible. He comments:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Surveys for Q3 have been very buoyant indeed. However the official data over the quarter so far have portrayed a slightly less robust picture. In particular, industrial production fell by 1.1% in August, while construction edged back by 0.1% in August (following a 2.8% rise).<br>We judge that these dynamics will result in an estimate of +0.8% for Q3, providing that the sectors above rebounded in September and that services maintained July\u2019s upward momentum.<br>It is not impossible that the figure is closer to 1% on the quarter. However it would need a confluence of positive forces for this to take place.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-10-18T16:53:45.395Z\">at 5.53pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-52615b2ce4b0010b6627a9f2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-18T16:10:52.441Z\">5.10pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">...but the dollar takes a knock</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>While <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/oct/18/chinese-growth-gdp-market-live#block-52615839e4b0bbc67cfff4d0\">stock markets in Europe</a> are rallying, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/oct/18/chinese-growth-gdp-market-live#block-52614c62e4b0760efba2af83\">gold prices are rising</a> and on Wall Street the S&amp;P 500 index has hit a fresh high after that last-minute debt deal, the dollar is having a tougher time.</p> <p>The US currency has fallen to a multi-month low against the euro and a currency basket as traders bet the Fed will delay tapering - scaling back its bond-buying stimulus programme, known as qunatitative easing (QE).</p> <p>Christopher Vecchio, currency analyst at DailyFX, comments:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The US Dollar is the worst performing currency for the second day in a row as market participants continue to price in another non-taper at this month\u00b9s Federal Reserve policy meeting. This shift in sentiment has been confirmed by price action in the US Treasury yield curve, where the belly<br> \u00ad 3- to 7-year notes \u00ad has seen yields fall faster than either the short- or long-end.<br>This is important to consider because the exact opposite situation developed between May 22, 2013 (when Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke noted at a Congressional testimony that the Fed could taper QE3 in the next few meetings) and September 17, 2013 (the day before the September FOMC meeting).<br>Whereas the 7Y yield gained the most from May to September, since the September QE3 non-taper, the 7Y yield has dropped by the most. Accordingly,if that steepening of the yield curve midyear helped propel US Dollar strength, then we suggest that a continued flattening of the yield curve will weigh on the greenback; and the belly of the yield curve should be eyed for hints on market expectations for Fed policy.<br>Whether or not changing dynamics of the US Treasury market continue to weigh on the US Dollar is up in the air, however, now that the US government shutdown has ended.</p> </blockquote> <p>And he sees a choppy week ahead:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>All of the US economic data that was withheld since October 1 will be released over the coming days, providing an extra spark of event-driven volatility.

The precious metal is on track to put in its strongest weekly gain in two months and currently stands at $1,316 an ounce.</p> <p>The short-term support for gold comes after the protracted US government shutdown has prompted traders to bet the US Federal Reserve will be in no rush to scale back its bond-buying stimulus - the scheme known as quantitative easing (QE).</p> <p>Expectations that such a change in policy was nigh - whereby the Fed \u201ctapers\u201d QE and buys a smaller value of bonds in a month - had taken the shine off gold in recent months.

The poll also revealed that despite hoping to benefit from the clampdown, New Democracy, the predominant force in the conservative dominated coalition, was only marginally ahead of the radical left main opposition Syriza party with both picking up 21.2% and 20.5% of the vote respectively.</p> <p>All round this is bad news and will fuel concerns \u2013 readily expressed \u2013 that the crackdown is being perceived increasingly as a smokescreen for yet more austerity measures. Tellingly, Golden Dawn\u2019s spokesman Ilias Kasidiaris, who also faces criminal charges, felt fit to liken Michaloliakos to the Turkish leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan who was himself imprisoned and banned from office before he took on Turkey\u2019s political establishment.</p> <p>&#xa0;\u201cHe was jailed for a year but then came out and put his rivals away for life,\u201d Kasidiaris told a television programme aired on the party\u2019s website in what will go down as an extraordinary step for an ultranationalist party that has made a meal out of denouncing the terrible Turk. </p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-d526577a-13b9-48e7-b81c-33cbaeb38372\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/18/1382102552618/1410666c-9405-4e3b-a539-48b1d9bbe0b8-460x304.jpeg\" alt=\"A woman walks past a poster with the picture of 35-year-old Greek rapper Pavlos Fissas, who was stabbed to death by a supporter of the far-right Golden Dawn party, in central Athens October 9, 2013.\" width=\"460\" height=\"304\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A woman walks past a poster with the picture of 35-year-old Greek rapper Pavlos Fissas, whose murder last month prompted the clampdown on Golden Dawn.

      "bodyText": "We end today in Greece where Helena Smith sends news of a highly unusual move by finance minister Yannis Stournaras. He has taken a swipe at the \u201ctroika\u201d of creditors propping up the country\u2019s debt-stricken economy.Helena reports from Athens: For the first time since he was elevated to the post of finance minister, the economics professor Yannis Stournaras has issued a broadside that appears to be directly aimed at Greece\u2019s foreign lenders. Emerging from talks with prime minister Antonis Samaras, the Oxford-educated academic gave reporters a taste of the frustration currently bedevilling the country\u2019s ties with its creditors. \u201cThe government cannot accept opinions which seem to undermine not only the efforts of the Greek people but primarily the improvement that we have of all the indicators in the Greek economy,\u201d he said. Clearly piqued, the technocrat then listed the achievements saying: \u201clike investment, foreign interest, spreads and so on.\u201d With the troika pushing for more austerity measures to cover a funding gap that it estimates will be \u20ac2bn next year, the ruling coalition is feeling the heat \u2013 and becoming increasingly determined to show that it means what it says when it insists that the Greeks cannot take any more cuts. Stournaras\u2019 outburst highlights the government\u2019s decision to toughen its stance ahead of visiting troika mission chiefs returning to Greece at the end of the month. With that we are closing the live business blog for today and will be back on Monday. Thanks for reading and for all the comments. China's growth numbers and relief over the US debt deal have driven the FTSE's gains today. My colleague Nick Fletcher has all the details on UK markets. He writes: As investors breathed a sigh of relief that the US had retreated from the brink of its debt crisis, and Chinese figures renewed confidence in the global economy, it was the Asian influence that gave Prudential a boost on Friday. The insurer rose to the top of the FTSE 100, adding 50p or 4% to \u00a312.64, following an upbeat statement late on Thursday from Asian rival AIA. AIA reported record quarterly results and said its new business rose by 26%. Traders said Prudential was benefiting since it had a strong presence in the region. The insurance sector was also helped by reports that an EU requirement on the amount of capital companies need to hold could be less onerous than initially suggested. Overall, it was a week of record highs, with Royal Mail, Google, Germany's Dax index and America's S&amp;P 500 all reaching new peaks. Read his full market report here: FTSE climbs to one month high on US relief and Chinese data Next week is a busy one for economic data, with a first glimpse of GDP growth in the third quarter topping the list in the UK. In Germany, we get the Ifo business survey on Friday and eurozone PMIs on activity across the region are out on Thursday. In the United States, after the shutdown held back some key data from government departments, there is a flood coming next week, top of the bill non-farm payrolls on Tuesday. Also due out in the US are: exisiting home sales on Monday, import and export price figures on Wednesday, durable goods orders on Friday. Taking a closer look at the data highlights ahead (all forecasts from Reuters polls of economists): Tuesday US non-farm payrolls data (originally scheduled for October 4 release) are expected to show the world\u2019s largest economy added 180,000 jobs in September after 169,000 reported for August - though that forecast is from a poll before the data delay. UK public finances data are also out on Tuesday. Wednesday Minutes from the Bank of England\u2019s latest policy meeting are expected to show the nine-member monetary policy committee was unanimous in its decision to leave interest rates at their record low of 0.5% and not to extend quantitative easing (QE). Thursday PMIs from the eurozone are out. Alan Clarke, economist at Scotiabank sums up his view for the region: Last week\u2019s data provided encouraging signs that the eurozone recovery is continuing. First, hard data on the supply side printed stronger than expected. Indeed, eurozone industrial production rose by 1.0% m/m in August while the very depressed July numbers were revised up. Second, the early survey indicators for October, namely the German ZEW index, moved further up suggesting that the appreciation in the EUR exchange rate has not yet reached the pain threshold which could derail the eurozone recovery. The ZEW survey is not the most reliable indicator, so there is no room for complacency. This week\u2019s business surveys will be much more important with the release of eurozone PMIs (Thurs), German Ifo (Fri) and French INSEE (Wed) surveys. Friday Economists expect growth of 0.8% on the quarter from the UK in the third quarter when the Office for National Statistics publishes its first take on the July-September period. That compares with 0.7% in the second quarter. Forecasts range from 0.5% to 1.0%. Philip Shaw, economist at Investec says an upside surprise on his 0.8% call is entirely possible. He comments: Surveys for Q3 have been very buoyant indeed. However the official data over the quarter so far have portrayed a slightly less robust picture. In particular, industrial production fell by 1.1% in August, while construction edged back by 0.1% in August (following a 2.8% rise). We judge that these dynamics will result in an estimate of +0.8% for Q3, providing that the sectors above rebounded in September and that services maintained July\u2019s upward momentum. It is not impossible that the figure is closer to 1% on the quarter. However it would need a confluence of positive forces for this to take place. While stock markets in Europe are rallying, gold prices are rising and on Wall Street the S&amp;P 500 index has hit a fresh high after that last-minute debt deal, the dollar is having a tougher time. The US currency has fallen to a multi-month low against the euro and a currency basket as traders bet the Fed will delay tapering - scaling back its bond-buying stimulus programme, known as qunatitative easing (QE). Christopher Vecchio, currency analyst at DailyFX, comments: The US Dollar is the worst performing currency for the second day in a row as market participants continue to price in another non-taper at this month\u00b9s Federal Reserve policy meeting. This shift in sentiment has been confirmed by price action in the US Treasury yield curve, where the belly 3- to 7-year notes has seen yields fall faster than either the short- or long-end. This is important to consider because the exact opposite situation developed between May 22, 2013 (when Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke noted at a Congressional testimony that the Fed could taper QE3 in the next few meetings) and September 17, 2013 (the day before the September FOMC meeting). Whereas the 7Y yield gained the most from May to September, since the September QE3 non-taper, the 7Y yield has dropped by the most. Accordingly,if that steepening of the yield curve midyear helped propel US Dollar strength, then we suggest that a continued flattening of the yield curve will weigh on the greenback; and the belly of the yield curve should be eyed for hints on market expectations for Fed policy. Whether or not changing dynamics of the US Treasury market continue to weigh on the US Dollar is up in the air, however, now that the US government shutdown has ended. And he sees a choppy week ahead: All of the US economic data that was withheld since October 1 will be released over the coming days, providing an extra spark of event-driven volatility. Bond and FX traders should pay particular attention to the calendar on Tuesday, when the September Nonfarm Payrolls report will be released. China's punchy economic growth data earlier has helped European stock markets finish the week on a high note. The FTSEurofirst 300, is up 0.6% at 1,275.67, having hit a five-year high at 1,276.92. The FTSE 100 in London has finished the day up 0.7% at 6,622.6. In Spain, the IBEX has held above the 10,000 threshold that it pushed through earlier this afternoon and is 0.8% at 10,001.8. It is the first time it has gone through 10,000 since July 2011. Michael Hewson, Senior Market Analyst at CMC Markets UK, comments: A strongimprovement in Chinese GDP data along with an anticipation of continued Fed stimulus into 2014 has given Europe\u2019s markets further impetus into the end of the week, as investors celebrate the fact that the uncertainty of the last three weeks coming from the US has finally been concluded in the short term. Three successive weeks of strong gains have seen the DAX make new record highs this week while the FTSE has come within touching distance of its September highs. As our market reporter Nick Fletcher recounts, Royal Mail shares have finished at 502.5p At the risk of posting one cat picture too many, there has been - predictably enough - a lot of reaction this afternoon to what David Cameron may or may not have intended to say about people wearing jumpers to cut their fuel bills in the UK this winter. No 10 says people should consider wearing jumpers to keep fuel bills down My favourite reaction and some others: Spencer Dale of the Bank of England has come back for more on Twitter and answered a few final questions submitted for the Bank's #AskBoE event today. He indulges this question with a pun-laden response and gets a message for Carney back: Sticking with markets, Gold prices have also risen a chunky amount today, capping a strong week. The precious metal is on track to put in its strongest weekly gain in two months and currently stands at $1,316 an ounce. The short-term support for gold comes after the protracted US government shutdown has prompted traders to bet the US Federal Reserve will be in no rush to scale back its bond-buying stimulus - the scheme known as quantitative easing (QE). Expectations that such a change in policy was nigh - whereby the Fed \u201ctapers\u201d QE and buys a smaller value of bonds in a month - had taken the shine off gold in recent months. Why does less QE typically mean softer gold prices? The metal is used by investors as a hedging bet against rising inflation, but a reduction in QE is seen as easing price pressures because less central bank cash will flow into financial institutions. But gold may not climb much further from here, warn some analysts. Despite this week\u2019s rise, the tapering anticipation effect will be back in play soon enough, says Citi analyst David Wilson. He tells Reuters: \u201cWe\u2019re now focusing on two things: the next time we\u2019ll have a debate on the (debt ceiling) issue, which is February, and tapering. \u201cThe debate has moved on from if to when (tapering will happen), so that will be continually factored into the gold price.\u201d \u201cRight now, I think gold\u2019s a sell,\u201d he said. \u201cI would think the trading range we had in the five or six days before (Thursday) is one we\u2019ll go back to.\u201d Mitsubishi analyst Jonathan Butler tells the newswire: \u201cIn the long run, the story hasn\u2019t really changed, in terms of seeing a sell-off as soon as tapering comes back on the agenda.\u201d And staying with stock market milestones, while Spain's IBEX breaks through 10,000, in the US, Google shares moments ago hit $1,000 after the search engine group reported a jump in advertising on Thursday. Google shares are currently at $1,004.20, having started this year at $703. In Spain, the IBEX share index has just gone through 10,000 for the first time since July 2011. As had been suggested earlier today by Lorcan Roche Kelly here. Business secretary Vince Cable's letter with some written background on the Royal Mail privatisation for the Business, Innovation and Skills Select Committee has just been posted online here. As Graeme reported earlier, Cable's letter denies Royal Mail was underpriced at 330p per share. In the letter he goes over the pricing process and work with the government's \"Global Coordinators (Goldman Sachs and UBS, together the \"GloCos\")\" as well as \"independent advisor\" Lazard. For those readers who want the details (full letter of course now openly available online), Cable writes: Given final demand indications from the GloCos, it was agreed that 330p was an appropriate valuation of our shareholding. This was endorsed by Lazard... Revising the price range upwards late in the bookbuild was considered given the demand generated. However this was not pursued based on an assessment of the composition of demand in the order book and an assessment of where demand would taper off, especially from informed potential long-term investors. After the market was provided with price guidance on Friday 4th October, (narrowing the initial price range of 260p - 330p to 300p - 330p), a number of the key long-only accounts expressed concern over the possibility that the top of the range might be revised above 330p; a number of other long-only accounts also indicated order sizes reducing as the price rose up to 330p. In addition, execution risk was pointed to by the GloCos. Good afternoon everyone, as Graeme Wearden mentioned, Katie Allen here taking over for the rest of the afternoon. At the opening bell on Wall Street, stock markets ticked higher. The Dow Jones industrial average has since slipped back and 10 minutes in is down 0.3% at 15327 but the Nasdaq is up 0.5% at 3883 and the S&amp;P 500 is up around 0.3% at 1738. Over to Greece again... where our correspondent Helena Smith says a new poll has shown that the neo-Nazi Golden Dawn party has hung onto to its core support base, in the face of the extraordinary moves taken to crackdown on it. Despite concerted efforts to unmask it as a criminal organisation, Golden Dawn remains firmly entrenched as Greece\u2019s third biggest political force. A survey commissioned by the leading polling company, ALCO, has once again reinforced officials\u2019 deepest fears: that despite a crackdown that will likely see more than half of its 18-strong parliamentary presence prosecuted for criminal intent \u2013 following the imprisonment of its leadership including Nikos Michaloliakos, the man who founded the party almost 30 years ago -- the far right extremists have held onto their core support. If elections were held today, 6.8% said they would vote for the neo-Nazi group compared to the 6.9% who catapulted it into the 300-seat House in June 2012. The poll also revealed that despite hoping to benefit from the clampdown, New Democracy, the predominant force in the conservative dominated coalition, was only marginally ahead of the radical left main opposition Syriza party with both picking up 21.2% and 20.5% of the vote respectively. All round this is bad news and will fuel concerns \u2013 readily expressed \u2013 that the crackdown is being perceived increasingly as a smokescreen for yet more austerity measures. Tellingly, Golden Dawn\u2019s spokesman Ilias Kasidiaris, who also faces criminal charges, felt fit to liken Michaloliakos to the Turkish leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan who was himself imprisoned and banned from office before he took on Turkey\u2019s political establishment. \u201cHe was jailed for a year but then came out and put his rivals away for life,\u201d Kasidiaris told a television programme aired on the party\u2019s website in what will go down as an extraordinary step for an ultranationalist party that has made a meal out of denouncing the terrible Turk. Meanwhile, the campaign to convince Greeks that the worse is nearly over continues apace. Helena explains: Amid heightened tensions between the debt-stricken country and its \u201ctroika\u201d of creditors at the EU, ECB and IMF over demands that Greece step up reforms \u2013 and cost cutting in the public sector \u2013 the development minister Kostis Hatzidakis insisted today that 2013 was the last year of recession. \u201cWe are three quarters of the way though and this is the last year of recession while next year we will be on a new path,\u201d he told parliament. \u201cWe are not yet in a spring of investment but something has begun to move,\u201d he said referring to the decision of companies like Hewlett Packard and Phillip Morris to set up shop in Greece. (and with that, I'm handing over to Katie Allen. Cheers all, and have good weekends. GW) Royal Mail shares continue to climb, hitting the 500p mark for the first time this morning. That means the shares have rocketed by 50% since being floated on the stock market a week ago. Lazards, who advised the government on the float, are going to have some serious explaining to do when MPs on the Business, Innovation and Skills committee quiz them in a few weeks. Business secretary Vince Cable is also being hauled back for a second interrogation. Sky News reports that Cable has already written to BIS, again denying that Royal Mail was underpriced at 330p per share. Cable has also, apparently, blamed the threat of a US default and industrial action for weighing on the potential price. (before then saying \"considerable media interest\" has driven shares up once trading began....) \"Value for money has been central to our strategy as we have taken forward the sale of shares through an initial public offering. \"Delivering value for money is about more than just the level of proceeds received on day one,\" he wrote. \"Our long-term strategy to safeguard the universal service and deliver value for money for the taxpayer involves not only getting good value for the initial stake sold but also getting good value for the residual stake held by Government (30% of the Company assuming exercising in full the Over-allotment Option), and leaving Royal Mail in a strong, sustainable position capable of accessing the capital markets in the future.\" Mr Cable said that the initial price range for the flotation, which attributed a value of between \u00a32.6bn and \u00a33.3bn to Royal Mail, was recommended by Goldman Sachs and UBS, the lead banking advisers, and endorsed by Lazard, which provided independent advice to ministers. More here: Cable Hits Back At Royal Mail Sale Critics Thousands of workers and students are protesting in Rome today, calling for an end to Italy's austerity programme. The demonstrations are taking place during a 24-hour strike called by Italian trade unions, as pressure mounts once again on prime minister Enrico Letta over the 2014 budget announced this week. AP has more details: The protests were accompanied on Friday by a 24-hour nationwide strike that caused disruptions for travellers. Train service was guaranteed in most cities for morning and evening commutes, but airports in Rome, Naples, Milan and Bologna had to cancel some flights. Some school and health workers also went on strike. The USB and COBAS unions organized Friday's strike to protest austerity measures reducing transportation budgets. USB union coordinator Pierpaolo Leonardi accused the Italian government of imposing EU directives without concern for the impact on workers. A smaller protest of about 600 workers was held in Milan. Enrico Letta has been under fire since the details of next year's budget emerged. It brought little relief to struggling Italian workers, containing more spending cuts and a continued freeze on public sector wages. There was also disappointment that Letta failed to deliver any meaningful tax cuts. The budget has been heavily criticised by opposition politicians and commentators, and by members of Letta's own government (as reader mrwicket flagged up in the comments this morning). Mario Monti's resignation as leader of his party last night, in a row over the budget, adds to the sense the Italian politics remains rather volatile. Italy's Monti quits party as budget opposition mounts It's official, Europe's equity markets are at their highest level since 2008: \u2022 EUROPE'S FTSEUROFIRST 300 HITS 5 YEAR HIGH AT 1,274.56 POINTS - REUTERS World stock markets are also at a five-year high. This morning's rally in Europe, and the earlier gains across Asia, pushed the MSCI All-Country World Index to levels not seen since before the collapse of Lehman Brothers. Bloomberg has the details: Global stocks rose for a third day, extending a five-year high, and copper climbed after China\u2019s economic growth quickened. Treasury 10-year note yields fell to a 12-week low. The MSCI All-Country World Index advanced 0.3 percent to 394.55, the highest since May 2008, at 7:35 a.m. in New York. Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s 500 Index (SPX) futures added 0.2 percent. The yield on 10-year Treasury notes fell as much as five basis points to 2.54 percent, the lowest since July 24, with high-yield credit risk dropping to the lowest since January 2008 in Europe. China\u2019s yuan had its best week in a year. Copper climbed 0.5 percent, extending the biggest weekly gain in a month. The pick-up in Chinese growth, and predictions that the US Federal Reserve won't slow its stimulus programme this year, get the credit: China\u2019s gross domestic product expanded 7.8 percent last quarter, the statistics bureau said in Beijing today, matching the median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of economists and halting a two-quarter slowdown. Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Charles Evans said yesterday the U.S. shouldn\u2019t reduce stimulus after some economic reports stopped during a 16-day government shutdown. Spencer Dale's Twitter interrogation is over (highlights), and has been well-received. BI: The Bank Of England Is Doing Something Really Cool On Twitter fastFT: Bank of England rates well on Twitter chat Tom Rafferty, China Analyst at The Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU), warns that the increase in Chinese growth rate is a \"temporary surge\" created by Beijing's stimulus measures, and could already be petering out. It reflects the impact of fiscal support extended by the government when economic growth appeared to risk drifting below its bottom-line earlier in the year. The robust condition of the property market has also helped to firm up demand for industrial materials and commodities. Despite the strong outturn in the third quarter, a number of the monthly indicators suggest that the economy is beginning to lose momentum. As the authorities reduce their level of support for the economy, and shift their focus to structural reforms designed to raise long-term productivity, growth is likely to ease in the near-term. Although The Economist Intelligence Unit is likely to raise its estimate of real GDP growth in 2013, to 7.6%, the underlying story of a slowdown in China's economy therefore remains unchanged. The EIU\u2019s forecast of 7.3% growth in 2014 will not be revised.\u201d European stock markets are showing solid gains after this morning's session, driven by China's GDP data and lingering relief that America's politicians agreed yesterday's spending bill. The news that China's economy expanded by 7.8%, year-on-year, in the last quarter has helped drive shares higher. Strong results from Google last night also helped push the STOXX 600 index to its highest level in five years. It's a steady day's trading - nothing too dramatic, with theFTSE 100 up 25 points at 6601, and France's CAC gaining 0.5%. Spain's IBEX is up 37 points at 9954, a two-year high, closing in on the 10,000 mark. Relief is the order of the day, as Spreadex trader David White put it: The sentiment in the market today is one of mild relief and back to business as usual. Alastair McCaig of IG agrees that risk is back on in the City: It might take retail investors a day or two to catch their breath but you suspect institutional investors are already hunting around for equity opportunities. McCaig also pointed to Google's forecast-beating results last night -- which drove its shares 6% higher in after-hours trading: Google\u2019s third-quarter figures has set the markets alight now that traders are able to refocus on corporate news. After climbing as high as $960 in after-hours trading, with a number of institutional analysts increasing their price targets north of the $1000 level, we are sure to see a lively day's trading when US markets open. The US dollar index has taken a bit of a pounding in the last 24 hours and at this rate looks set to retest its February lows. Ahead of the open, we expect the Dow Jones to start 18 points higher at 15,389. Fantasy dinner party, anyone? You can see the full Q&amp;A (which will run for a few more minutes) here. Spencer Dale's online Q&amp;A is going rather well (certainly better than British's Gas's twitter fiasco yesterday). Half an hour in, and the Bank of England chief economist has answered questions on interest rate moves: The short-term spending and debt ceiling deal agreed in Washington: The power of forward guidance: And the Bank's track record on controlling inflation: Attention Twitter users.... Spencer Dale, the Bank of England's chief economist, is about to hold an online Q&amp;A. Our chance to grill him about borrowing costs, or the Bank's new 'forward guidance' (which pegs interest rates to the jobless rate). He'll be using the @bankofengland account, and the #AskBoE hashtag. Questions are already queuing up.... Yesterday, we reported Dale's prediction that interest rates could rise as soon as next year. Interest rates may rise next year, says Bank of England chief economist Presumably he's not been put on Twitter as a penance?.... Could Germany soon find itself with a new finance minister, as the price for a new coalition government? Die Welt reports this morning that the SPD party is pushing for the top jobs in the finance office and the labour ministry if it joins Angela Merkel's CDU party in a Grand Coalition. With SPD chairman Sigmar Gabriel apparently lined up for the Labour brief, the finance ministry could go to SPD parliamentary leader Frank-Walter Steinmeier, or its parliamentary secretary Thomas Oppermann. Here's Die Welt's story (in German). Discussions about policy and cabinet posts should begin next week, and could last a month. Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble has indicated he wanted to stay as finance minister, but clearly both sides must make concessions for the coalition to fly. One big job is certainly vacant - at the foreign ministry, as incumbent Guido Westerwelle's FPD party failed to get back into the Bundestag. Steinmeier was Minister for Foreign Affairs in between 2005 and 2009, in Merkel's first grand coalition with the SPD. He seems to favour the Labour ministry this time, though. Reuters reckons that, if the SPD claims the finance minister's brief then Sch\u00e4uble could be shuttled to the foreign ministry. Here's its factbox on the negotiations Speaking of Greece, the leader of the Democratic Left party has been hospitalised after being taken ill at Athens International Airport. Fotis Kouvelis was taken to the capital's Geniko Kratiko Hospital after fainting, but fellow politicians insist there's no reason for alarm. Kathimerini reports: According to sources, Kouvelis had come round by later on Friday morning, but doctors who gave him first aid treatment proposed that he undergo preventive medical tests. Speaking to Skai, Health Minister Adonis Georgiadis said there was no cause for concern. Kouvelis' close associate Thodoros Margaritis gave the same message \"The doctors did not convey to us any serious concerns.\" Democratic Left quit the Greek coalition government in the summer. Another opposition leader, Syriza's Alexis Tsipras, appears to be in the running for the European Left's candidate to be the next EU commission president. Greece's tourism sector enjoyed a much needed boost in August. Data released by its central bank this morning showed that tourist revenues rose by 12.4% in August, to \u20ac2.8934bn. That means total tourism revenue during 2013 is 13.7% higher, at \u20ac8.698bn. The Bank of Greece also reported that the country's current account surplus shrank in August, due to a widening trade gap. It dropped to \u20ac1.221bn, from \u20ac1.633bn in August 2012. However, that still leaves Greece with a current account surplus for this year of \u20ac1.6bn, compared to a hefty deficit of over \u20ac13bn in 2011. Boris Johnson, Mayor of London, has underlined the importance of the Chinese economy by calling for a new free trade deal between China and the UK, if an EU-wide deal can't be agreed. Boris was speaking during a visit designed to build closer business ties between the two countries. PA has the details: At a British Chamber of Commerce event in Hong Kong, Mr Johnson asked the audience what they wanted to change in London to help break down barriers between the West and the East, and was told to reform import duty and sort out VAT claim-back issues at Heathrow Airport. Mr Johnson said: \"VAT and import duty - those it seems to me are classically things that can be resolved by growing trade and co-operation between London and China, London and Beijing. We need a proper, thoroughgoing free trade agreement. \"If the EU won't do it we can do it on our own.\" Mr Johnson said: \"Free trade would bring greater prosperity in both Britain and China and we should embrace it. \"It would mean better access for British projects to Chinese markets, access that would bring huge benefits to London's economy, creating jobs and growth. Relations between Brussels and Beijing did stumble over the summer, with the EU accusing China of dumping solar panels on its market. However, the trade talks haven't collapsed -- so Boris's latest bright idea may not be needed. Japanese bank Nomura predicts slower Chinese growth in 2014, and reckons the 7.8% annualised growth in the last quarter was just a blip: The Chinese economy used to rattle along with annualised growth of 10% each year, Sunday Times economics editor David Smith reminds us. Not any more.... Strong stuff from Marc Ostwald of Monument Securities this morning. He argues that China's rising growth rate is a blow to those claiming the Chinese economy was stumbling as Europe and the US recovered. Ostwald writes: While healthy scepticism should attend that China data, given that the accuracy of a GDP report produced just 10 working days after the end of the quarter that it references in an economy that encompasses 1.3 billion people has to be questioned, regardless of whether it is a command economy or not. But it still runs counter to the opinion propaganda of the past 6 months, which has resolutely emphasised the strength of private sector growth in the US, China's imbalances and its opined financial sector 'time bomb', and Europe's much vaunted nascent recovery that ignores the fact that there are 3 major economies in the Eurozone: Germany projected to grow just 0.4% in 2013, France seen at best at a negligible 0.1% and Italy seen contracting at least 1.0%, and the rest with the deepest respect are in fact \"peripheral\". And here's more reaction to China's GDP growth jumping to 7.8% in the last quarter: Ting Lu, economist at Bank of America-Merrill Lynch: The growth peak was behind us in the third quarter,\" said\"We believe the People's Bank of China will slightly shift its monetary policy from a moderate expansion in the third quarter to a neutral stance. Louis Kuijs, chief China economist at RBS: The uptick in growth reflects both better exports and solid domestic demand, although the easing of industrial output growth in September indicates that the recovery is tepid. Stan Shamu of IG: In the current environment where China concerns still linger, in-line readings are actually more positive than anything else. The fact that China remains on track is positive for risk sentiment. The US dollar continues to slide, though, sending the euro up to a new eight and a half-month high of $1.369. Europe's markets are open, and they're following Asia's lead with gains across the board. In early trading the FTSE 100 rose 30 points, or 0.45%. The blue-chip index is lead by insurance firms Prudential (+2.3%) and retailer Sports Direct (+1.5%, perhaps on forecasts of higher sales now England are gracing next year's World Cup.) . Other European markets are also gaining, with the French CAC up 0.5%, Spain's IBEX up 0.3% and Italy's FTSE MIB and the German DAX both up 0.4%. Ishaq Siddiqi, market strategist at ETX Capital, said traders were also reacting to events on Wall Street last night: Brighter session in Europe this Friday after stronger China growth data figures together with the S&amp;P500 overnight closing at a record high. Traders on Wall Street responded with relief over the temp fix to America\u2019s fiscal situation, kicking equity markets higher.... Siddiqi added that the slower growth in Chinese industrial output, retail spending and fixed asset investment last month could be a concern: So when taken all together, the overall growth figures will encourage investors about the current state of the Chinese economy, the breakdown of other economic indicators suggest that we could see some weakness in upcoming quarters. Asian stock markets rallied on the news that Chinese economic growth picked up in the last quarter. In Seoul, the main Korean index just closed at a two-year high, up 0.6%. Australia's S&amp;P/ASX200 rose 0.7% to a five-year closing high. And India's Sensex has jumped by 1.5% so far today, putting its own five-year high in sight. The US budget and debt ceiling resolution is also pushing markets up. As a Paris-based trader told Reuters: Now that the crisis in over in the United States, investors are back in the market, and the fear of missing the rally is becoming stronger than the fear of a market correction, so this rally has still legs. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the global economy, the eurozone and the business world. With the threat of America defaulting off the table (for now), attention can return to the state of the world economy, and the fragile state of the eurozone recovery. And the latest signs from China are pretty encouraging. The Chinese economy grew by 7.8% in the third quarter of 2013, accelerating from the 7.5% in the second quarter -- driven by stronger demand from overseas and within China. It suggests Beijing's efforts to stimulate its economy and rebalance towards more domestic demand are bearing fruit. However.....some Chinese data released overnight is slightly less cheering: growth in industrial activity, retail sales and fixed asset investment all slipped in September, while net exports dropped slightly. That suggests the risk of an autumn and winter slowdown remains, as our news story explains: Optimism from the government figures released on Friday could fade quickly as global demand remains volatile, which was underlined by a surprise fall in exports in September. Efforts at home to engineer slower but more sustainable growth will also weigh on the economy in coming quarters, analysts say. \"The Q3 GDP figure is in line with market expectations but the uncertainty is whether the current recovery is sustainable,\" said Shen Jianguang, chief China economist with Mizuho Securities in Hong Kong. \"We think the recovery in the third quarter was mainly driven by the strong momentum of the property market.\" I'll mop up more reaction shortly..... The news sparked a share rally in Asia overnight, and traders reckon shares will rise in Europe this morning too. Elsewhere, there are fresh signs of political instability in Italy -- former technocratic PM Mario Monti resigned the leadership of his centrist party last night. While in Greece, the government's crackdown on the far-right Golden Dawn party continues, as does the speculation about a third aid deal in 2014. We'll be tracking the key developments through the day, as usual....",

      "bodyText": "Mortgage lenders said on Friday that they were financing the largest house-buying spree for five years, in the latest sign of an accelerating housing market. The Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML) described house prices in London as \"resurgent\", though it acknowledged that they had risen only modestly elsewhere in the country. Amid continuing debate about the impact of government-sponsored schemes designed to make credit more easily available, research by the Liberal Democrat peer Lord Oakeshott showed, however, that the house price revival was not just a London phenomenon. Houses in more than 50 local authority districts were revealed as less affordable than at the peak of the 2007 credit crunch. Oakeshott's analysis of local authorities in England found the ratio between local house prices and local earnings was higher than it was in 2007 in districts as diverse as Rutland, the Cotswolds and the Suffolk coast. According to the CML, almost \u00a350bn was advanced to home buyers in the third quarter of 2013, a 17% increase on the previous three months and the highest figure since the third quarter of 2008. Despite a slight dip in September, lending for that month was up 41% on the same month last year, at \u00a316bn. \"Indicators suggest we are witnessing the strongest house purchase performance in five years,\" said the CML's chief economist, Bob Pannell. \"House prices too have revived, but modestly, aside from a resurgent London market.\" The earlier than expected introduction of the second stage of Help to Buy, designed to help buyers with deposits as low as 5% of the value of a property, has sparked a debate about the potential for a boom in house prices. The Bank of England has said it will keep a close watch on the markets and the terms offered by lenders, but insists a boom is not under way. The Bank's own data showed that mortgage approvals for the three months to August had reached their h\u2260\u2260ighest level since February 2008, the month Northern Rock was nationalised, and lending on credit cards was at its highest since February 2010. In contrast, credit to businesses continued to be sucked out of the system, contracting by \u00a32.3bn in the three months to August. Oakeshott said in a column in Property Week that this showed Funding for Lending was failing to help the businesses on which the government had pinned its hopes for economic recovery. Instead, he said, the scheme was restarting a \"house price merry-go-round\". \"The Bank of England's Funding for Lending scheme has failed so far to get desperately needed cash out to small and medium-sized businesses, but has supercharged bank lending on residential property. It's hard to imagine a worse way to rebalance the economy away from the excesses of the noughties,\" said Oakeshott, who runs a property fund called OLIM Property. The CML cited a number of factors to back up its claim that the housing market was at its strongest for five years. Not only is mortgage lending rising, but homeowners took out more than 61,000 home loans in August, 15% higher than a year earlier. \"House prices too have revived over recent months, although much of this reflects the impact of a modest but more broadly based pick-up, overlaid upon what is clearly a resurgent London market. As the Office for National Statistics has recently reported, as of July house prices excluding London are a little over 1% higher than a year ago,\" the CML said. Matthew Pointon, property economist at Capital Economics, said he was gauging whether current prices represented a bubble by measuring mortgage debt as a proportion of earned income, rather than against the disposable income gauge used officially. \"The authorities are taking comfort from the fall in mortgage debt as a share of disposable income in recent years. But that primarily reflects a rise in benefit payments and net interest income, as well as lower taxes. The more relevant indicator for assessing whether further house price gains are warranted is the share of mortgage debt to earned income, and that is still close to record highs.\"",

      "bodyText": "As investors breathed a sigh of relief that the US had retreated from the brink of its debt crisis, and Chinese figures renewed confidence in the global economy, it was the Asian influence that gave Prudential a boost on Friday.

      "body": "<p>It's only a two-hour wait. An ordinary Thursday afternoon at Apple's flagship UK store in Regent Street, London and a long line of customers snakes across the first floor. The hip technology brand is used to queues for the launch of its latest must-have product, but these people have come carrying faulty iPhones and malfunctioning laptops, desperate for help from one of Apple's increasingly hard to reach \"Genius\" experts.</p> <p>When it opened in Virginia in 2001, the first Apple store was hailed as a retail revolution, allowing shoppers to play with expensive technology without any sales pressure. The emphasis on service, with blue-shirted Geniuses on hand to answer queries and fix broken products, has become almost as important to the Apple brand as the aesthetic appeal of its products. But the whole experience is under pressure as a relatively small number of shops struggle to cope with rapidly growing customer numbers. Next week's launch of a new iPad is likely to add to the pressure.</p> <p>Last week, Apple hired Angela Ahrendts, the respected boss of the British fashion label Burberry, to head up its high street and online shop division.</p> <p>With a turnover of $19bn (\u00a311.7bn) and the highest sales per square foot of any retail chain on the planet, Apple's shops dwarf Burberry's. With only around 415 outlets worldwide and retail sales a far smaller proportion of overall revenues than at the fashion brand, there is plenty of room for growth.</p> <p>Ahrendts has also been hired with an eye to her fashion experience, given that the rumoured iWatch, which is likely to be the first of many wearable Apple technologies, could be launched as early as next spring.</p> <p>Ahrendts, said to be a big fan of wristwatches, will undoubtedly have ideas about how such a product can best be displayed and marketed. She also faces the challenge of helping Apple keep its shops at the cutting edge in terms of service and design.</p> <p>The Regent Street outlet, for example, employs at least 120 Geniuses. Each sees up to 30 customers a day but it is impossible to book an appointment less than a week in advance. If the problem is urgent you can turn up and queue, but it could be a very long wait. This week, a gaggle of well-trained, polite and friendly staff worked their way along the line trying to answer simple queries and advise people on alternatives to queueing. But it is hard to redirect people when every nearby shop has its Geniuses fully booked for days on end.</p> <p>The problem is not limited to London. In Apple's Paris flagship store there were no Genius appointments available for 10 days. In New York, the SoHo outlet is so busy that local residents complained a few years ago \"no bar, nightclub or construction site comes close to ruining continually our quality of life like Apple SoHo has\".</p> <p>There is hope that Ahrendts, who has helped make Burberry a world leader in tech-driven shops underpinned by high quality service, will help to bring change. Some argue that Apple needs to take itself further upmarket, so it can serve fewer customers more effectively. That could be an option.</p> <p>The former Dixons boss John Browett, Ahrendts' predecessor, who was sacked after less than six months, is thought to have clashed with Apple's most senior executives over plans to make the shops more efficient. He looked at ways to use fewer staff and produce a similar kind of outlet more cheaply. That may not be the route Apple wants to take but if it is to cope with growing demand it needs to open more shops and come up with clever ways of tackling overcrowding.</p> <p>Jeff Kindleysides, of the store design group Checkland Kindleysides, said Apple should follow the trend towards handy local outlets: \"The problem is accessibility. They could have specialist stores that just deal with iPhones, for example, where customers know why they should go there.\"</p> <p>In Santa Monica, California, Apple has experimented with a completely different approach to improving accessibility by holding workshops outside its shops. Apple experts use a new app to talk to customers while they are on the move. That approach might be more difficult to employ on a wet and windy afternoon in Manchester than in sunny California, but it demonstrates creative thinking.</p> <p>Ahrendts' expertise in linking the online and physical retail worlds at Burberry might also produce other ways of helping customers without the need to visit an outlet. There's certainly a need to improve on a service where you may have to wait for hours for a reply to an email query.</p> <p>David Daziel of the store design firm Daziel &amp; Pow suggests Apple could also open up more \"dead\" space within its existing shops. But Ahrendts will have to move carefully, he said. \"Every one of our clients talks about Apple as the benchmark. There is no one else that has the conviction and clarity that they do in their stores.\"</p> <p>He points out that, even though it is a cutting edge technology company, Apple doesn't do fancy interactive presentations in its stores. The store environment is straightforward and sparse, with computers, iPads and iPhones laid out simply on tables.</p> <p>The company often selects buildings that are beautiful in their own right and highlights the architecture rather than relying on the kind of glitzy gadgetry employed in Burberry's most recent London shop.</p> <p>\"Burberry is a completely immersive digital experience, which is completely the opposite of what Apple does. They use the product and there is no other distraction,\" Daziel said. \"If Apple tries to be like Burberry it might find itself losing some of its uniqueness.\"</p> <p>The move into wearable technology will also present a new challenge. Such items may not look so appealing laid out on tables. Tim Kobe of Eight Inc, the company that helped come up with the original Apple store design, reckons the format is beginning to date. He told the Dezeen website: \"I think the design is getting a little long in the tooth in terms of just continuing to roll out the same type of solution. My sense is that retail is a competitive environment, and I think Apple's ready for that next shift.\"</p> <p>Ahrendts' job is to manage that shift, and she will need all her experience of using social media and other interactive tools to help blur the boundary between the physical and digital world in a way that reduces the queues without losing the magic of the original Apple stores.</p> <h2>New products</h2> <p>Apple's latest iPhones, introduced late last month, remain resolutely high-end despite all the talk before their launch of a cheap version.</p> <p>The iPhone 5C, the source of those rumours, is around the same price as Apple would probably have dropped the iPhone 5 to now, had it not decided to discontinue it when it launched the latest models.</p> <p>The top iPhone 5S retails at the same price as the old iPhone 5 when it was the most advanced model.</p> <p>The impression that the 5C is no more than a 5 in a plastic case has apparently led to disappointing sales.

      "bodyText": "How the UK copes with an increasingly lonely population of over-65s is a key economic and social question, and it is great that the health secretary has thought to mention it in his latest speech. Jeremy Hunt has searched earnestly for an answer. The British way of ageing is deeply flawed, he says, concluding that adopting the Asian way of caring is the answer. The first problem with calls for Britons to be more Asian when it comes to care, just like injunctions to adopt German rigour in business and the Swedish way of family life, is that we are British and culturally we behave very differently. But let's set that aside and ask whether the Asian solution is the answer. Firstly, the responsibility for caring, outside state-organised schemes, often falls to women \u2013 and usually to the middle-aged mother who is also still mainly responsible for bringing up children. Most caring within state and private institutions is also carried out by women, but they are paid and gain some economic independence. Caring when it means giving up work is a form of servitude that leaves many women deeply unhappy. Closer to home, both Germany and Italy have low birth rates associated with traditional family duties.

Pressure to keep the birthrate low is even more intense in Italy, where mothers are also expected to look after parents and in-laws. Italy avoided bankruptcy in the financial crash largely because its welfare state is largely conducted by an unpaid workforce of guilt-tripped women. Having children has become a minority occupation. Secondly, the Asian example is associated with an agrarian economy, where family is close by. Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia and China are rapidly urbanising and confronting the same issues as us. Consider this brief extract from an article in the Jakarta Post: Cumi Solechah, a 65-year-old widow, says she did not think her senior years would be spent in a nursing home. \"Life is just a mystery.

Her husband then passed away. Umi did not elaborate on why she went to a nursing home aside from saying: \"I was abandoned by my brothers and sisters despite my contributions to them.\" Is this the Asian example Hunt wants us to emulate? Indonesia's National Commission for the Elderly said only 3.9% of the country's elderly in 2006 could rely on their monthly pension fund. The commission said this drove about 50% of elderly women to rely on their children and their partners, compared with 29% of elderly men. The Post reported one nursing home head as saying that in many cases the elderly were abandoned by their children or other family members if they had a low income or health issue such as Alzheimer's. Geoff Mulgan, the boss of the government-funded ideas charity Nesta, says we need to create a volunteer workforce to bring the poorer and weaker people among our 12 million over-65s together to alleviate poverty and tackle loneliness. In 2009 I argued for a programme of national service for the over-65s. Mulgan wants a voluntary scheme, and mine would not be compulsory but with elements of coercion and guilt to spur participation. This system would build on existing networks and draw on charities and the latest thinking among local authorities for co-operative ventures.

In aerospace and defence, Liberum said: Government attempts to boost UK exports to \u00a31tr by 2020 are highly relevant given the defence industry's export potential. However, there is risk of negative meddling surrounding big ticket platforms, such as the new aircraft carriers built by BAE Systems and Babcock. On transport, Liberum said FirstGroup, Go-Ahead, National Express and Stagecoach are all exposed to the tougher regulation proposed by Labour. Finally Royal Bank of Scotland could be forced to split into a good and bad bank.",
