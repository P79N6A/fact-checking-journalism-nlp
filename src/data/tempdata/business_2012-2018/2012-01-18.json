      "bodyText": "Fidelity, one of the biggest investors in the stock market, has spoken out against \"over-generous\" and \"over-complex\" boardroom pay and called for shareholders to be given extra powers to vote down cash and share deals. In a move that supports the government's plans to hand shareholders more rights to veto pay deals, Fidelity argues that remuneration reports should be backed by 75% of investors \u2013 compared with 50% now \u2013 and the vote should take place before any bonus is handed to a director. Using unusually confrontational language for a major investor more accustomed to operating behind the scenes, Dominic Rossi, chief investment officer of equities at Fidelity Worldwide Investment, said more transparency was needed on executive pay. \"During the last bull market, boardroom pay dramatically increased relative to the average pay of all employees in a company. Despite the financial crisis of 2008, this trend is continuing. The simple truth is that remuneration schemes have become too complex and, in some cases, too generous and out-of-line with the interests of investors,\" Rossi said. He argued that remuneration committees \u2013 the sub-committee of boards that set executive pay \u2013 need to be more sensitive to the current mood. \"We say to remuneration committees: make sure you understand the mood of the market; tell us in simple terms what you propose; and let shareholders decide.

If the remuneration report fails to attract 75% support, it should be put to a second vote and if it fails again, the chair of the remuneration committee should step down, he said. His remarks come at a critical time for the government, which has pledged to offer shareholders a binding vote on remuneration reports, in contrast to the current rules introduced in 2003 that grant investors an advisory vote on pay. The prospect of a binding vote has proved controversial with some investors after data from shareholder advisory group Pirc found just 18 remuneration reports had been defeated since the advisory voted was introduced. Fidelity's support for a binding vote \u2013 and at a 75% threshold \u2013 coincided with a demand by the shadow business secretary, Chuka Ummuna, that Vince Cable, the business secretary, deliver his proposals on executive pay to the Commons on Tuesday. Cable is preparing to announce his response to last year's consultation on executive pay in a speech at the Social Market Foundation.

David Cameron has already indicated the ratio proposals are unlikely to be taken forward, although Cable is expected to say he wants workers to be more closely involved in the way executive pay is set. Raising a point of order in the Commons, Ummuna said Cable should not be able to duck taking questions on the proposals to crack down on top pay. Ummuna said: \"Executive pay and rewards for failure in the country's boardrooms and the City are a matter of immense public interest \u2013 it is right and proper that any policy change in this area by the government should first be announced to parliament and that the people's elected representatives be given the opportunity to question the business secretary on it\". The Department of Business, Innovation and Skills launched a consultation on executive remuneration last year when Cable was attacked by the new director-general of the British Chambers of Commerce, who called it a \"hobby horse project\". The public mood appears to have hardened since then, as Cameron and his minister have pledged to crack down on executive pay and have seized upon a report by the High Pay Commission, funded by leftwing pressure group Compass and backed by money from the Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust, that warned how \"corrosive\" high pay was to the wider economy.",

Certainly, the company's \u00a3680m pension fund deficit is at least partly traceable to its decision to fall in with corporate fashion during the boom years of the 1990s, and take a seven-year pension holiday for both company and staff that only ended in 2002.</p> <p>There is also the question of whether a move to Care pensions will eventually be followed by Unilever's staff being pushed into an even less generous scheme.

The company claim this is a \"framework rather than a mandatory policy\", but the unions smell a rat: they say that Unilever will only commit to Care pensions for three years, which leaves the way open for yet another downgrade. For the last recorded financial year, Unilever's CEO, Paul Polman, was paid a basic salary of more than \u00a3900,000, and a bonus of \u00a31.45m, as well as \u00a3900,000 in free shares and a \u00a3300,000 contribution to \u2013 you've guessed it \u2013 his pension.

    "sectionName": "Business", 
    "webTitle": "Mario Monti promises Italy won't ask Britain for bailout money", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Italy's prime minister, Mario Monti, has pledged that UK taxpayers will not be asked for bailout funds following his commitment to spending cuts and labour market reforms that he believes will eliminate Rome's budget deficit by next year. After a meeting on Wednesday in London with David Cameron, Monti said UK taxpayers had not provided bailout funds to Italy so far and that there was no reason why he would ask for them in the future. His comments came after the International Monetary Fund warned it needed at least $500bn (\u00a3324bn) in extra funds to support indebted countries, including members of the eurozone, should they be locked out of international money markets. The Washington-based global lender confirmed on Wednesday that it was looking to boost funding to $1tn, a shift that would require as much as \u00a319bn from the UK on a proportional basis. Fears that Italy will be forced to seek a bailout from the European Union and the IMF have heightened uncertainty over the future of the single currency. Germany has come under scrutiny, despite its reputation as a safe haven, following concerns that it may be forced to act as lender of last resort to the entire eurozone. Ratings agency Egan-Jones downgraded Germany's sovereign debt last night by one notch to AA-, citing the large financial burden being imposed on Berlin as the main reason. Monti is due to attend a crisis meeting of the 27 EU states in Brussels on 30 January to thrash out a closer fiscal union. The pact could provide a platform for the European Central Bank (ECB) to provide \u20ac1tn in cheap financing to banks and nations desperate to refinance existing loans. Italy's new technocratic government is against a fire sale of state assets to fund its next budget. Monti said structural reforms to spur growth would underpin his drive to cut the country's debts. \"We both believe \u2013 the UK and Italy \u2013 that adherence to fiscal discipline is a necessary condition for growth. It is not, however, a sufficient condition. And we both believe that not only our individual countries but the EU as a whole has a big role to play \u2026 to foster economic union in a sustainable way.\" A draft fiscal pact has already been criticised by the ECB for being too weak. But the Finnish government has taken the opposite stance and criticised the pact for going further than Helsinki can stomach in overriding national sovereignty. The UK government wants a viable pact in place before agreeing to any IMF request for funds. The Commons has already given the Treasury leeway to draw down an extra \u00a310bn to give the IMF, but anything further would require a fresh vote in the Commons \u2013 and be likely to prompt a backbench Tory rebellion. Ed Balls, the shadow chancellor, has said Labour will vote against extra cash if there is no serious sign that the EU is taking action to strengthen the euro, specifically through further interventions by the ECB. Balls would also like to see a shift in broader European economic policy so there is less emphasis on austerity and more on securing growth. The previous increase in IMF funding last summer was passed in the Commons by 274 votes to 246, despite a rebellion by 32 backbench Tory MPs. Boris Johnson, the mayor of London, said on Wednesday after addressing the 1922 committee of Tory MPs that he favoured an orderly default on Greece's debts. Asked about increasing UK contributions to the IMF to help the eurozone, he said: \"Everybody understands that the euro probably needs a resolution of one kind or another.

      "body": "<p>Italy's prime minister, Mario Monti, has pledged that UK taxpayers will not be asked for bailout funds following his commitment to spending cuts and labour market reforms that he believes will eliminate Rome's budget deficit by next year.</p> <p>After a meeting on Wednesday in London with David Cameron, Monti said UK taxpayers had not provided bailout funds to Italy so far and that there was no reason why he would ask for them in the future.</p> <p>His comments came after the International Monetary Fund warned it needed at least $500bn (\u00a3324bn) in extra funds to support indebted countries, including members of the eurozone, should they be locked out of international money markets. The Washington-based global lender confirmed on Wednesday that it was looking to boost funding to $1tn, a shift that would require as much as \u00a319bn from the UK on a proportional basis.</p> <p>Fears that Italy will be forced to seek a bailout from the European Union and the IMF have heightened uncertainty over the future of the single currency.</p> <p>Germany has come under scrutiny, despite its reputation as a safe haven, following concerns that it may be forced to act as lender of last resort to the entire eurozone. Ratings agency Egan-Jones downgraded Germany's sovereign debt last night by one notch to AA-, citing the large financial burden being imposed on Berlin as the main reason.</p> <p>Monti is due to attend a crisis meeting of the 27 EU states in Brussels on 30 January to thrash out a closer fiscal union. The pact could provide a platform for the European Central Bank (ECB) to provide \u20ac1tn in cheap financing to banks and nations desperate to refinance existing loans.</p> <p>Italy's new technocratic government is against a fire sale of state assets to fund its next budget. Monti said structural reforms to spur growth would underpin his drive to cut the country's debts. \"We both believe \u2013 the UK and Italy \u2013 that adherence to fiscal discipline is a necessary condition for growth. It is not, however, a sufficient condition. And we both believe that not only our individual countries but the EU as a whole has a big role to play \u2026 to foster economic union in a sustainable way.\"</p> <p>A draft fiscal pact has already been criticised by the ECB for being too weak. But the Finnish government has taken the opposite stance and criticised the pact for going further than Helsinki can stomach in overriding national sovereignty.</p> <p>The UK government wants a viable pact in place before agreeing to any IMF request for funds. The Commons has already given the Treasury leeway to draw down an extra \u00a310bn to give the IMF, but anything further would require a fresh vote in the Commons \u2013 and be likely to prompt a backbench Tory rebellion.</p> <p>Ed Balls, the shadow chancellor, has said Labour will vote against extra cash if there is no serious sign that the EU is taking action to strengthen the euro, specifically through further interventions by the ECB. Balls would also like to see a shift in broader European economic policy so there is less emphasis on austerity and more on securing growth. The previous increase in IMF funding last summer was passed in the Commons by 274 votes to 246, despite a rebellion by 32 backbench Tory MPs.</p> <p>Boris Johnson, the mayor of London, said on Wednesday after addressing the 1922 committee of Tory MPs that he favoured an orderly default on Greece's debts. Asked about increasing UK contributions to the IMF to help the eurozone, he said: \"Everybody understands that the euro probably needs a resolution of one kind or another. It's my own belief \u2026 that [resolution] won't be achieved by endlessly bubblegumming the thing together and that some kind of orderly readjustment is necessary.\"</p> <p>An IMF spokesman said: \"Based on staff's estimate of global potential financing needs of about $1tn in the coming years, the fund would aim to raise up to $500bn in additional lending resources.

And while it remained cautiously optimistic about the long-term prospects \u2013 assuming the right formula will be found eventually \u2013 the report described Fresh &amp; Easy as a \"reasonably sustained drag on Tesco's earnings\" that needed to be addressed with some urgency. At the Hermosa Beach store opening, Fresh &amp; Easy was clearly on a mission to please, filling the store with customer service representatives, organising a raffle of store vouchers and giving away fabric shopping bags.

In 2009 Leahy received some \u00a310m in pay and cheap or free shares while Mason received about \u00a37m. The payday sparked a row about executive pay with one US investment group accusing Tesco of giving excessive rewards that its performance did not merit. The row did not go away and iI 2010 the retailer faced embarrassment at the annual meeting when almost half of shareholders failed to back the pay deal. To avoid a repeat of the showdown, Tesco overhauled directors' pay last year with Mason's bonus scheme dropped and new targets set for directors based on wider group performance measures. Analysts think Fresh &amp; Easy will make a loss of at least \u00a3125m in the year to February with Tesco aiming to break even in the coming financial year. The US chain's improving performance was a small detail that got lost within last week's Christmas trading update, which contained its first profit warning in 20 years, wiping \u00a35bn off the company's stock market value. Tesco said that unlike its UK stores Fresh &amp; Easy had a very successful Christmas and New Year with underlying sales up nearly 20%.

      "bodyText": "Goldman Sachs set aside $12.2bn (\u00a38bn) to pay its staff in 2011 \u2013 an average of $367,000 (\u00a3238,000) each \u2013 sparking criticism that the Wall Street firm was living in a \"parallel universe\". The payouts sparked a backlash from unions, who regard them as evidence that David Cameron's government should take steps to ensure top pay is better linked to performance. Campaigners for a \"Robin Hood tax\" on transactions said it backed their case for new levies on banks. \"When even in a bad year each Goldman employee pockets an average of $367,000 \u2013 nearly 10 times the average UK salary \u2013 it's proof that banks live in a parallel universe to the rest of us,\" said a spokesman for the Robin Hood Tax campaign. Goldman used a greater proportion of its revenue (42%) to pay its 33,000 staff in 2011, compared with 39% a year ago. The firm axed 7%, or 2,400, of its staff during the year and those who remain will learn the size of their bonuses in coming days. The highest profile firm on Wall Street reported full-year revenues of $28.8bn \u2013 down 26% and earnings almost halved to $4.4bn. Lloyd Blankfein, chairman and chief executive of Goldman, blamed \"global macroeconomic concerns\". The total payout per staff member of $367,000 \u2013 a figure which includes salaries, bonuses, equity awards and benefits \u2013 was down 15% on the $430,000 paid the previous year. The actual amount set side to pay staff was down 21% at $12.2bn. David Viniar, Goldman's finance director, insisted \"discretionary\" bonuses were down \"considerably more than revenues\" during the year and said the firm had embarked on a strategy to cut $1.4bn of costs. But the TUC general secretary, Brendan Barber, said: \"Goldman Sachs are brazenly defying their own sliding profits by dishing out pay and top bonuses worth \u00a3240,000 a head. This latest example of excessive rewards for mediocrity should give the government the green light to get tough on top pay. Ministers should start by putting workers on remuneration committees and making pay and bonuses exceeding \u00a3260,000 liable for corporation tax.\" The firm has recently disclosed more about its pay deals in the UK as a result of rules set out by the Financial Services Authority requiring firms to publish pay for \"code staff\" \u2013 those taking or managing risk. Regulatory filings for Goldman Sachs Group Holdings (UK) show that it had 95 code staff in 2010 who had an average pay deal of $6.2m (\u00a34m) in 2010 \u2013 and had a further $595m awarded in a one-off mid-year award of shares in 2010. \"This past year was dominated by global macroeconomic concerns which significantly affected our clients' risk-tolerance and willingness to transact,\" Blankfein said. \"As economies and markets improve \u2013 and we see encouraging signs of this \u2013 Goldman Sachs is very well positioned to perform for our clients and our shareholders,\" he added. The turmoil in the eurozone held back many of its business areas. Revenues in investment banking were down 9% while its business that underwrites share offerings was down 14%. Its fixed income, currency and commodities operations suffered a 34% fall in revenue. \"Although activity levels in 2011 were generally consistent with 2010 levels, and results were solid during the first quarter of 2011, the environment during the remainder of 2011 was characterised by broad market concerns and uncertainty, resulting in volatile trading and significantly wider credit spreads, which contributed to difficult market-making conditions and led to reductions in risk by the firm and its clients,\" the firm said.",

The firms asked accountants to check a sample and found 28% of the files reviewed failed to meet the necessary stands.

      "bodyText": "Royal Bank of Scotland's insurance arm, Direct Line and Churchill, has been fined \u00a32.1m by the Financial Services Authority for breaching rules on handling customer complaints. The fine would have been \u00a31m higher if RBS had not co-operated with the investigation by the City regulator \u2013 a probe that was launched when files being sent by the insurance business to the FSA were found to have been \"improperly altered\", some with fraudulent signatures. The FSA had been reviewing complaints files and, after being tipped off, found that of 50 files that had been requested by the regulator, 27 had been altered. While the alterations were minor and did not affect customers, the FSA took the offences seriously. Tracey McDermott, the FSA's acting director of enforcement and financial crime, described the problems as a \"serious breach\" of the rules. \"The firms' attempt to ensure that complete files were provided to the FSA backfired. The firms failed to give clear instructions, resulting in staff making inappropriate alterations, with one individual even forging the signatures of colleagues. The firms' management did not know what changes had been made or when,\" she said. \"In this case, the alterations did not impact on the FSA's ability to do our job. The significant penalty is however intended to underscore to firms that it is of critical importance that material provided to the FSA must reflect the picture as it is \u2013 not as they might like it to be,\" she added. RBS is priming the insurance businesses for sale next year to meet European Union rules covering the \u00a345bn of taxpayer bailout handed to the bank. Paul Geddes, chief executive of RBS Insurance, said he regretted the findings. He said: \"Although no customers were disadvantaged, we are very disappointed that we did not meet the standards we expect of ourselves and which the FSA expects of us.\" The problems arose after the FSA told Direct Line and Churchill that it intended to review how effectively they were handling complaints. The firms asked accountants to check a sample and found 28% of the files reviewed failed to meet the necessary stands. Staff were warned that they risked enforcement action if this continued. In April 2010, some 50 files were sent for a formal review by the FSA, which was tipped off that some had been altered. Some 27 of the 50 files had been altered before they were sent to the FSA, and seven internal documents were found to contain staff signatures forged by one member of staff.",

      "bodyText": "November's pensions strike by public sector unions wiped out 988,000 working days, according to official figures \u2013 the most time lost to industrial action in a single month since Margaret Thatcher was in power. The Office for National Statistics, which published its assessment of the impact of the strike on the labour market alongside the latest unemployment figures, said the last time a strike had such an impact was in 1989. The data also shows that pay growth in the public sector, excluding the bailed-out banks, is running at just 1.4% a year, the slowest rate since comparable records began in 2001. Unemployment across the economy rose by 118,000 in the three months to November, to 2.68 million, the ONS said, in the latest sign that the UK slowed sharply in the autumn. The unemployment rate rose to 8.4%, the ONS said, its highest since 1995, and up 0.3% over the quarter. There was some evidence that the labour market may be stabilising: the rise in unemployment was less dramatic than the 128,000 increase in the three months to October, while the narrower claimant count measure showed a smaller than expected increase of 1,200 in December to 1.6 million. However, the ONS said a total of 1.3 million people are now working part-time because they are unable to find a full-time role: the highest number since records began in 1992. The number of young people out of work is also continuing to rise, hitting 1.04 million in the three months to November, up 52,000 on the three months to October. The ONS also confirmed that the painful squeeze on households' income has continued, with average pay across the economy just 1.9% higher than a year ago \u2013 less than half the rate of inflation. The government's claim that private sector jobs growth will help to compensate for cuts in the public sector was undermined by news that 67,000 jobs were lost in the public sector in the three months to September \u2013 the latest period for which the ONS has figures \u2013 while the private sector created just 5,000 posts. Chris Williamson, the chief economist at information provider Markit, said weak pay growth would continue to depress demand in the coming months. \"The increase in unemployment, plus job security worries and low pay growth for those in work, means consumer spending may remain very subdued this year, despite lower inflation alleviating the squeeze on real incomes that caused so much distress to households in 2011.\" Official figures next Wednesday will reveal whether the economy expanded in the final three months of 2011, with many City economists forecasting a negative number, which could mark the start of a new recession.",

Developing countries would also have much less fiscal space than in 2008 with which to react to a global slowdown (38% of developing countries are estimated to have a government deficit of 4% or more of GDP in 2011). As a result, if financial conditions deteriorate, many of these countries could be forced to cut spending pro-cyclically, thereby exacerbating the cycle.\"</p> <p>The co-ordinated global response to the 2008-09 slump saw interest rates slashed, money created through quantitative easing, public spending increased and taxes cut. \"Monetary policy in high-income countries will also not be able to respond as forcibly as in 2008-09, given the already large expansion of central bank balance sheets,\" the Bank said. \"Among developing countries, many countries have tightened monetary policy, and would be able to relax policy (and in some cases already have) if conditions were to deteriorate sharply.\"</p> <p>Burns said China had the resources and the political will to mount a counter-cyclical policy, but was unlikely to be able to boost its economy as quickly as it did three years ago. \"There was a big response in 2008-09 but it is not obvious that the same mechanisms can be used as effectively as they were in 2008-09.

As a result, if financial conditions deteriorate, many of these countries could be forced to cut spending pro-cyclically, thereby exacerbating the cycle.\" The co-ordinated global response to the 2008-09 slump saw interest rates slashed, money created through quantitative easing, public spending increased and taxes cut. \"Monetary policy in high-income countries will also not be able to respond as forcibly as in 2008-09, given the already large expansion of central bank balance sheets,\" the Bank said. \"Among developing countries, many countries have tightened monetary policy, and would be able to relax policy (and in some cases already have) if conditions were to deteriorate sharply.\" Burns said China had the resources and the political will to mount a counter-cyclical policy, but was unlikely to be able to boost its economy as quickly as it did three years ago. \"There was a big response in 2008-09 but it is not obvious that the same mechanisms can be used as effectively as they were in 2008-09. Those parts of the economy that were stimulated in 2008-09 are already over-heating.\"",

      "bodyText": "Airbus has pledged to create up to 600 jobs in the UK this year, but sent a shot across the bows of domestic manufacturers by warning that Britain's GKN recently lost out on a lucrative parts contract to a Korean rival because it was not competitive enough. Tom Enders, Airbus's chief executive, said the bid for work on wings for the A320 jet was won by Korea Aerospace Industries because it made a cheaper pitch. However, Enders dismissed as \"nonsense\" claims from the Unite trade union that Europe's largest planemaker is undermining the British aerospace industry. \"I know this comes up because we have recently made headlines with outsourcing of so-called UK work to Korea. But that was just simply because of competitiveness. We were running a very competitive tender here.\" He said GKN, also a big player in the car parts industry, submitted a below-par bid. \"GKN did not make their utmost effort to come up with their best offer.\" According to one report, the loss of the work on bottom skins for A320 wings had scuppered plans to create 800 jobs in the UK \u2013 a number Airbus sources do not recognise. Speaking in Hamburg at the annual press conference for Airbus's parent group, EADS, Enders said the move underlined the need for Airbus to stay competitive against rivals including Boeing and did not signal a withdrawal from the UK. \"This company needs to reduce costs,\" he said. \"We need to internationalise further. It is not a signal that we are withdrawing from the UK. That is nonsense.\" Airbus has a workforce of 10,000 in the UK, largely at its wing manufacturing plant in Broughton, north Wales, and at its design and testing facility in Filton near Bristol. Enders said Airbus would create around about 500-600 jobs in the UK this year and company sources said the positions would probably be based at Filton and Broughton. However, Enders used the opening of a new facility at Broughton last year to warn that plane manufacturing at Airbus was no longer a eurocentric activity. \"The best way is for governments to finance and invest in intellectual infrastructure and support research and technology so that we have a basis to work in the UK in the long term,\" he said in October, after Broughton opened a new facility to make wings for the A350 jet. Some 15% of Airbus production is in the UK but the successful KAI bid underlines the threat to that figure, which is understood to have been at 20% in the early years of the production programme for the A380 superjumbo. Britain is the world's second largest exporter of aerospace products. The UK industry, including Rolls-Royce jet engines, employs 96,500 people and generated sales of \u00a323.1bn in 2010. The TUC has meanwhile urged the government to follow Germany's example in manufacturing and do more for apprentices and so-called mittelstand \u2013 medium-sized companiesfirms. Brendan Barber, the TUC general secretary, said: \"The UK has much to learn from Germany \u2013 it is the powerhouse of the European economy and its politicians have never lost sight of the value of their manufacturing sector. But it's not too late for British manufacturing \u2013 a new approach to skills, investment and procurement could help bring the UK back to its rightful place as one of the major manufacturing nations of the world.\"",
