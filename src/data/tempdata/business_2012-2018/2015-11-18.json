      "bodyText": "Amber Rudd\u2019s \u201cnew model\u201d for the UK\u2019s energy market looks very like the old model. It is a mix of the legally necessary, the uncertain and the expensive. At least it was served with an amusing garnish \u2013 the idea that government will one day be able to step back and let market forces supply the nation\u2019s energy needs. Pull the other one. In the age of nuclear, renewables and internationally binding targets for reducing carbon dioxide emissions, energy infrastructure only gets built when the government agrees subsidies and sets economic incentives. Energy secretaries will be in the \u201creset\u201d game for years. The necessary part of Rudd\u2019s policy was the headline-grabber: the closure of the UK\u2019s fleet of coal-fired stations by 2025, with restricted running to operate from 2023. Coal is a dirty fuel and stopping its use is the surest way for the government to meet its carbon-reduction targets without breaking the law. As Peter Atherton, analyst at Jefferies, pointed out, closure in the middle of the next decade has been assumed in government planning for years. The uncertain \u2013 or, more generously, ambitious \u2013 element is building enough gas-fired power stations to replace coal and ensure security of supply. How will it happen? \u201cWe need to get the right signals in the electricity market,\u201d said Rudd. \u201cWe are already consulting on how to improve the capacity market. And after this year\u2019s auction we will take stock and ensure it delivers the gas we need.\u201d Those vague sentences hint at many government interventions. The capacity market is the mechanism via which suppliers are paid to be there, regardless of whether their power is required (for example, on days when wind or solar are supplying more of the mix). The problem is that the current payments, and current wholesale power prices, are too low to prompt mass construction of gas-fired stations. A commitment to close coal stations should, as Rudd argued, encourage more investment in gas but it will not guarantee it. Higher capacity payments \u2013 and thus higher bills for consumers \u2013 will have to be agreed. But that is not the most expensive part. That is nuclear. Hinkley Point in Somerset, as everybody knows by now, will be the most expensive power station built anywhere in the world, with its output priced at twice the current wholesale price and linked to inflation for 35 years. One fears Hinkley has set a benchmark for the financing of all the other new nuclear power stations Rudd envisages. If her line about being \u201ctough on subsidies\u201d applies to nuclear, and not just renewables, it will be astonishing. Ladbrokes merger isn\u2019t everyone\u2019s favourite Dermot Desmond, the Irish billionaire, has left it very late \u2013 probably too late \u2013 to whip up a rebellion among fellow Ladbrokes shareholders against the proposed merger with Gala Coral. But he makes some excellent arguments for why this is \u201cthe wrong deal\u201d for Ladbrokes. First, both companies can\u2019t know how much damage will be inflicted by the Competition and Markets Authority, whose predecessor body blocked the same transaction in 1998. The internet, and mobile apps, have changed the betting landscape since then but Ladbrokes and Coral are still the second and third largest players on the high street. Thus there will be forced disposals of shops \u2013 Desmond quotes estimates of between 400 and 1,000 \u2013 and Ladbrokes will likely have to sell at less than the implied purchase price in the Coral deal. The buyers will be direct competitors. Second, Coral brings \u00a32.2bn of debt, which will bust Ladbrokes\u2019 traditional borrowing thresholds. With some justification, Desmond says the real winners are Coral\u2019s private equity owners. Third, the merger triggers a \u00a375m payment to Playtech, partner for both companies\u2019 digital operations. In one swipe, a year\u2019s planned cost savings will be consumed, and Playtech gets to negotiate a new technology agreement. The case for the defence is that greater size brings greater opportunity to invest, not least in Ladbrokes\u2019 perennially misfiring online business. That\u2019s one reason why the board will probably win next week\u2019s vote. Another is that Desmond\u2019s call for Ladbrokes to explore \u201cstrategic options ... in a very active mergers and acquisitions market\u201d sounds too wishy-washy. During the long descent of Ladbrokes\u2019 share price under chairman Peter Erskine and former chief executive Richard Glynn, no bidder emerged. Yet, on the pure analysis on the deal, the market seems to share Desmond\u2019s low opinion. A 16% drop in Ladbrokes\u2019 share price since the merger announcement is damning.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Barclays\u2019 reputation took another battering on Wednesday when a US regulator imposed a $150m fine on the bank for the way it treated its foreign exchange customers. The New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) released a cache of emails to support its finding against Barclays, including one in which a managing director tells staff to \u201cobfuscate and stonewall\u201d if asked questions about the currency trades. The penalty, which also requires Barclays to fire an unnamed senior individual involved in its electronic global foreign exchange trading business, is related to a computer system the bank devised to reject orders from customers that would not be profitable. The system, known as Last Look, operated by introducing a hold period between a customer order being received and it being executed by Barclays. It allowed the bank to root out trades where the price had moved against them, often in just milliseconds. Customers \u2013 who were sophisticated users such as hedge funds \u2013 would receive messages saying \u201cNACK\u201d (not acknowledged). One customer questioned the receipt of 300 such messages on one day in December 2010 but did not receive a response. Anthony Albanese, the regulator\u2019s acting superintendent of financial services, said: \u201cThis case highlights the need for greater oversight and action to help prevent the misuse of automated, electronic trading platforms on Wall Street, which is a wider industry issue that requires serious additional scrutiny.\u201d The fine is a reminder of the reputational issues still facing the bank in the wake of the 2012 fine for rigging Libor, which sparked a wave of recriminations against Barclays and the entire industry. It also comes just two weeks before the bank\u2019s new chief executive, Jes Staley, takes on his \u00a38m-a-year role. When his appointment was announced last month Staley, a US banker, said: \u201cI feel keenly we must continue to strengthen trust in Barclays.\u201d It is the second NYDFS fine imposed on Barclays for foreign-exchange-related matters this year and takes the total paid by the bank to the New York regulator to $635m. The first was part of a \u00a31.5bn fine on Barclays announced in May, when regulators in the US and UK announced record-breaking fines for manipulating foreign exchange markets. The risk of ongoing fines for banks was raised by ratings agency Moody\u2019s in a report this week that put Barclays, HSBC and Royal Bank of Scotland at high risk of further penalties. Moody\u2019s calculated that 15 major banks had set aside \u00a3144bn to pay legal costs and settle fines and compensation since the onset of the 2008 banking crisis. Barclays admitted it faced further penalties. It said it \u201ccontinues to co-operate with other ongoing investigations and to manage related litigation risks as previously disclosed\u201d. The NYDFS said the problems with Last Look took place on certain occasions between 2009 and 2014. The regulator added that Barclays had made changes to the system in September and October 2014 as result of the broader investigation into foreign exchange market rigging, but that 7% of the activity pushed through the trading platform had continued to benefit Barclays until August 2015.",

It allowed the bank to root out trades where the price had moved against them, often in just milliseconds.</p> <p>Customers \u2013 who were sophisticated users such as hedge funds \u2013 would receive messages saying \u201cNACK\u201d (not acknowledged). One customer questioned the receipt of 300 such messages on one day in December 2010 but did not receive a response.</p> <p>Anthony Albanese, the regulator\u2019s acting superintendent of financial services, said: \u201cThis case highlights the need for greater oversight and action to help prevent the misuse of automated, electronic trading platforms on Wall Street, which is a wider industry issue that requires serious additional scrutiny.\u201d</p> <p>The fine is a reminder of the reputational issues still facing the bank <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jun/27/barclays-chief-bob-diamond-bonus-fine\">in the wake of the 2012 fine for rigging Libor, </a>which sparked a wave of recriminations against Barclays and the entire industry. It also comes just two weeks before the bank\u2019s new chief executive, Jes Staley, takes on his \u00a38m-a-year role.<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/28/barclays-appoints-jes-staley-new-chief-executive\"> When his appointment was announced last month</a> Staley, a US banker, said: \u201cI feel keenly we must continue to strengthen trust in Barclays.\u201d</p> <p>It is the second NYDFS fine imposed on Barclays for foreign-exchange-related matters this year and takes the total paid by the bank to the New York regulator to $635m. The first was part of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/may/20/banks-hit-by-record-57bn-fine-for-rigging-forex-markets\">a \u00a31.5bn fine on Barclays announced in May</a>, when regulators in the US and UK announced record-breaking fines for manipulating foreign exchange markets.</p> <p>The risk of ongoing fines for banks was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/nov/17/barclays-hsbc-royal-bank-of-scotland-moodys-risk-further-penalties\">raised by ratings agency Moody\u2019s in a report this week</a> that put Barclays, HSBC and Royal Bank of Scotland at high risk of further penalties. Moody\u2019s calculated that 15 major banks had set aside \u00a3144bn to pay legal costs and settle fines and compensation since the onset of the 2008 banking crisis.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/nov/17/barclays-hsbc-royal-bank-of-scotland-moodys-risk-further-penalties\">Barclays, HSBC, Royal Bank of Scotland 'at risk of further penalties'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Barclays admitted it faced further penalties.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Blanket austerity across the crisis-hit countries of the eurozone was self-defeating. Germany\u2019s analysis of what needed to be done was wrong. The European Central Bank (ECB) was slow to come up with a stimulus package designed to offset the demand-sapping impact of wage cuts. Those were the main messages of an important International Monetary Fund (IMF) intervention into the debate about how the eurozone should have responded to the problems that affected five of its members \u2013 Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Spain and Italy. This quintet accounts for 30% of eurozone output. The traditional IMF cure for a country in trouble is a solid dose of structural adjustment \u2013 tax cuts, privatisation, reforms of the labour market \u2013 designed to make the domestic economy more efficient, coupled with a devaluation that makes exports cheaper and imports dearer. This recipe was obviously not available to countries inside the eurozone because they all share the same currency. Instead, the recovery plan involved internal devaluation, making an economy more competitive through a reduction in costs. Given that pay is the biggest element of these costs, it requires wage cuts \u2013 and thumping ones at that. The IMF paper asks whether this policy actually works. Its conclusion is that if a single country cuts wages, the effect is positive both for that economy and for the eurozone as a whole. But if five countries adopt the same strategy at once, there has to be action from the central bank to offset the demand-sapping wage cuts. Put simply, if millions of workers across Europe have less money in their pockets, they will consume less. That will affect their own economies and the economies of other non-crisis eurozone countries that export to them. But, as the IMF economists note, there is a problem if official interest rates are already at rock-bottom levels. In those circumstances, central banks have to be a bit more creative if they want to counteract the recessionary impact of wage cuts. One solution is to resort to quantitative easing, something the Bank of England and the Federal Reserve did back when the slump was at its worst in 2008-09. It took the European Central Bank a further five years before it embarked on its own QE programme, by which time sucking demand out of the eurozone economy had achieved predictable results: a double-dip recession, double-digit unemployment rates and a descent towards Japan-style deflation. In a blogpost explaining the paper, the two IMF economists \u2013 Jorg Decressin and Prakash Loungani \u2013 stress that their organisation has \u201calways advocated a comprehensive package that addresses both aggregate supply and aggregate demand\u201d. They add that the fund was \u201cone of the early advocates of supportive monetary policies, including quantitative easing, to boost aggregate demand in the euro area\u201d. The phrases \u201calways advocated\u201d and \u201cearly advocates\u201d are significant. Mario Draghi, the ECB president, finally wore down German resistance to QE, but only after a protracted struggle and when it was clear, even to Berlin, that the eurozone was suffering from a severe lack of demand. In one sense, the IMF analysis is a bit disingenuous. If, as the paper says, it knew from the start that internal devaluations on their own would not work, it makes the fund\u2019s willingness to back bailout packages rather curious. But leaving to one side this blatant back-covering, the analysis is right. The eurozone has begun a slow and tentative recovery since the ECB stepped up its macroeconomic stimulus. Better late than never.",

One solution is to resort to quantitative easing, something the Bank of England and the Federal Reserve did back when the slump was at its worst in 2008-09.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c20a3636b494cc96a94236a28c58f1f539a26eb4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c20a3636b494cc96a94236a28c58f1f539a26eb4/0_71_3364_2019/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The European Central Bank president, Mario Draghi\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The European Central Bank president, Mario Draghi, finally wore down Germany\u2019s resistance to QE.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eric Vidal/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jan/22/ecb-unveils-1-trillion-qe-plan-stimulate-eurozoen-economy\">It took the European Central Bank a further five years before it embarked on its own QE programme</a>, by which time sucking demand out of the eurozone economy had achieved predictable results: a double-dip recession, double-digit unemployment rates and a descent towards Japan-style deflation.</p> <p><a href=\"http://blog-imfdirect.imf.org/2015/11/17/the-effects-of-wage-moderation-can-internal-devaluations-work/\">In a blogpost explaining the paper</a>, the two IMF economists \u2013 Jorg Decressin and Prakash Loungani \u2013 stress that their organisation has \u201calways advocated a comprehensive package that addresses both aggregate supply and aggregate demand\u201d. They add that the fund was \u201cone of the early advocates of supportive monetary policies, including quantitative easing, to boost aggregate demand in the euro area\u201d.</p> <p>The phrases \u201calways advocated\u201d and \u201cearly advocates\u201d are significant. Mario Draghi, the ECB president, finally wore down German resistance to QE, but only after a protracted struggle and when it was clear, even to Berlin, that the eurozone was suffering from a severe lack of demand.</p> <p>In one sense, the IMF analysis is a bit disingenuous. If, as the paper says, it knew from the start that internal devaluations on their own would not work, it makes the fund\u2019s willingness to back bailout packages rather curious. But leaving to one side this blatant back-covering, the analysis is right. The eurozone has begun a slow and tentative recovery since the ECB stepped up its macroeconomic stimulus. Better late than never.</p>",

Large poultry producers were hit by the worst case of avian flu in US history earlier this year resulting in the death of more than 48 million birds. About 7.5 million of them were turkeys \u2013 a fact that has sparked panic among some Americans, who were left wondering about whether they would have a bird on their Thanksgiving table. Well, Americans, rest easy. There will be enough turkey to go around this Thanksgiving. In fact, those turkeys were killed and frozen months ago. \u201cFrozen turkeys were produced and placed in cold storage \u2013 flash frozen quality in March, before avian influenza in late April and May,\u201d Keith Williams, president of the US turkey federation, said. \u201cThe last case of avian influenza was in June. Frozen supplies continued to build throughout that time, because only a few states of the upper midwest were affected and the remaining large producing states continued to produce daily supplies and add to cold storage.\u201d Overall, bird flu has claimed a little over 3% of the US turkey population. That\u2019s equivalent to about 7.5 million of the 240 million birds the US Department of Agriculture projects will be produced this year. But Americans who really want a fresh turkey may want to go ahead and freak out about whether they\u2019ll be able to get one this year. \u201cFresh turkey always is more a challenge to find because 85% of the production in America is of the flash-frozen quality that continues to remain in supply; 15% of the market is of the fresh turkey variety,\u201d said Williams. \u201cFresh turkey is delivered just days before Thanksgiving, and has been and always will be something one needs to order ahead of time.\u201d According to Williams, there is little difference between fresh or flash-frozen turkeys, as the flash frozen birds have \u201cvirtually the same freshness as the day they were processed\u201d. The only difference, he said, is personal preference in price and convenience. Wholesale prices of turkeys are up about 17% compared to last year, reaching $1.36 a pound. \u201cWholesale prices have increased, but they bear no relation to retail prices under the circumstances of Thanksgiving marketing promotions,\u201d said William. The truth is, supermarkets have a vested interest in supplying their customers with turkeys. \u201cThanksgiving is the big shopping day of the year for grocery stores, and they plan ahead for these promotions and contract for supplies months in advance.\u201d If a supermarket can lure shoppers seeking turkeys, chances are the customers will also purchase additional groceries necessary for a Thanksgiving dinner. Thus supermarkets can and do offer special discount promotions for frozen turkeys. Kroger supermarkets ran ads for their promotions in newspapers like the Detroit Free Press as early as the first week of November. Their offer? A pound of turkey for as little as 59 cents. Some reports of a turkey shortage have raised concerns for supply at food banks and pantries which help provide Thanksgiving dinner for the poor. \u201cWe are not seeing any shortage in turkey donation, but the purchasing price of a turkey is higher by an average of 30 cents,\u201d Carol Schneider, associate director of media relations at the Food Bank for New York City, said. \u201cThat is due to the turkey shortage and will affect anyone who is purchasing a turkey for the holidays.\u201d According to Schneider, the food bank placed its turkey order in August.",
