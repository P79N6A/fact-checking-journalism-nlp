      "bodyText": "Malcolm Turnbull has called the chairman of Australia Post after it was revealed its chief executive takes home a multimillion pay packet. Documents published on Tuesday showed Ahmed Fahour was paid a $4.4m salary and a $1.2m bonus last financial year. A parliamentary committee revealed the salaries of Fahour and senior Australia Post executives, saying there were no compelling reasons for the details to be kept from public scrutiny. The documents showed another five executives, who have not been named, earned between $1.8m and $1.3m each. The prime minister said while pay was a decision for the board, he did speak to the chairman, John Stanhope, on Wednesday morning about the package for Fahour, who was born in Lebanon but grew up in Melbourne. \u201cI think that remuneration is too high,\u201d he told reporters in Canberra. Turnbull acknowledged Fahour had a big job overseeing a large government-owned entity, which had improved its operating business. \u201cIn my view, I say this as someone who spent most of his life in the business world before I came into politics, I think it is a very big salary for that job,\u201d Turnbull said. Australia Post, which employs more than 36,000 people, said on Wednesday the remuneration of the executive team, including Fahour, was set by the organisation\u2019s board. Fahour\u2019s total remuneration package took into account the size of the $6bn-turnover business, the statement said. It also reflected the large changes being made to Australia Post and that more than 73% of its revenue came from the nonregulated side of the business where it was competing with major global players such as DHL, FedEx and Toll. Fahour\u2019s remuneration for the 2016 financial year \u201cincluded a performance-based short-term bonus in line with Australia Post returning to profit. The previous year he did not receive a bonus\u201d, the statement said. It added that since 2007 Australia Post has paid more than $6.3bn in dividends and taxes to the federal government. Australia Post does not receive any taxpayer funding. In a chain of correspondence dated after a Senate committee hearing in October, Australia Post had argued revealing the salaries could expose its executives to unwarranted media and cause brand damage. It preferred to release the information on a confidential rather than public basis. But committee chair James Paterson wrote back to the company on Tuesday informing it the documents would be publicly released. \u201cAny potential issues of personal safety and security do not appear to be compelling reasons to withhold publication,\u201d he said. Paterson said Fahour\u2019s salary effectively made him the nation\u2019s highest-paid public servant. Crossbench senator Nick Xenophon praised Paterson for disclosing the salaries. He noted Fahour\u2019s pay was 10 times higher than the prime minister\u2019s. \u201cI think a lot of people will scratch their heads on that one,\u201d he told ABC TV. The Labor senator Doug Cameron questioned whether the executive payouts were value for money, adding Australian bosses were generally overpaid. \u201cThey try and push Bangladesh wage rates and conditions for their workers but Wall Street pay and conditions for the executives,\u201d he said. Cabinet minister Matt Canavan said Fahour would likely face further questions at his next Senate estimates committee appearance.",

      "bodyText": "The UK could lose 30,000 finance sector jobs as a result of Brexit, but EU rivals need to act to avoid importing banking risk to the continent, according to an influential thinktank with close ties to the European commission. The City of London stands to lose 10,000 banking jobs and 20,000 roles in accountancy, law and consulting, as EU clients move business worth \u20ac1.8tn (\u00a31.6tn) to the continent after Brexit, according to Brussels-based Bruegel. According to the economics thinktank\u2019s model, Frankfurt would be the biggest winner, with Paris, Amsterdam and Dublin also making gains. But the researchers warn that having a more geographically diverse spread of financial institutions, without stronger oversight of banks, would heighten the risk of a banking meltdown in the event of an acute financial crisis. These risks could be reduced and benefits shared more evenly, the authors argue, if the EU takes a common approach to investment banks rather than 27 national systems in a \u201cregulatory race to the bottom\u201d to steal London\u2019s crown. The analysis is based on the assumption the UK will leave the single market, as set out in Theresa May\u2019s Brexit speech last month. \u201cBrexit involves risks for market integrity and stability, because the EU including the UK has been crucially dependent on the Bank of England and the UK Financial Conduct Authority for oversight of its wholesale markets,\u201d states the report. \u201cWithout the UK, the the EU27 must swiftly upgrade its capacity to ensure market integrity and financial stability.\u201d Nicolas V\u00e9ron, a co-author, said the EU faced a mix of risks and opportunity, but had barely started discussing post-Brexit financial regulations. \u201cWhat is important is for the EU27 to find its feet in the new financial system of the post Brexit landscape,\u201d he said. Rather than creating \u201c27 clones of the FCA and Bank of England\u201d, the EU should instead design \u201ca more centralised consistent architecture\u201d, with central authorities for banking regulation and conduct, V\u00e9ron added. The City could be a flashpoint in Britain\u2019s EU exit, given London\u2019s outsized role as Europe\u2019s financial centre. Twice as many euros are traded in London as in the 19 countries of the single currency combined. Bruegel was an early advocate of \u201cbanking union\u201d \u2013 the eurozone\u2019s shared, but unfinished, system of banking rules \u2013 and its reports are closely read within the EU institutions. V\u00e9ron expressed optimism that the EU would act despite the loss of political momentum that many people expect in 2017 as a result of elections in the Netherlands, France and Germany. Barring an upset, by October 2017, \u201cgovernments would be in place, which would create a fairly favourable context for decision-making\u201d, he said.",

    "webTitle": "Co-op CEO Richard Pennycook to step down", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Co-operative Group chief executive, Richard Pennycook, who rebuilt the company after its banking crisis, is to step down. Steve Murrells, the chief executive of the Co-op\u2019s food division, will replace him. Pennycook was a key figure in saving the Manchester institution from collapse after the dire financial problems of the Co-operative Bank were compounded by a 2013 tabloid sting that revealed drug use by the bank\u2019s former chairman Paul Flowers. Murrells joined the Co-op in 2012 and has led a successful turnaround of its once ailing grocery chain. The former Tesco executive will replace the outgoing chief executive on the group board on 1 March. Pennycook will then leave the business at the end of March, after the company agreed to forego his six-month notice period, leading to speculation that he has another role lined up. \u201cRichard Pennycook saved our Co-op,\u201d said the Co-op chairman, Allan Leighton. \u201cIn three short years he has rescued and rebuilt our business, and restored pride to our 70,000 colleagues and 4.5 million members. We owe Richard a huge debt of gratitude and his place in Co-op history is secured.\u201d Pennycook will remain on the payroll, however, as he is being retained as an adviser for a fee of \u00a320,000 a month. The role will be focused on the fate of the mutual\u2019s 20% stake in the loss-making Co-op bank. Concerns about the bank\u2019s future have intensified in recent days after it announced that its capital ratio, a key measure of financial strength, would fall below 10%. Leighton said the group was open-minded about the future of the bank stake and did not rule out being part of a plan to inject more capital into the beleaguered lender. Leighton described the handover to Murrells, who previously ran Tesco\u2019s One Stop convenience chain, as a \u201cclassic piece of succession\u201d. Pennycook said his next career step would involve \u201cgoing plural\u201d \u2013 a phrase popularised by Leighton in the 2000s, which refers to building a career out of multiple directorships. Pennycook first signalled plans to build a portfolio career when he resigned from Morrisons in 2012. He joined the Co-op as interim finance director in the summer of 2013, but stepped up in 2014 to lead the group after Euan Sutherland quit, following the leaking of details of his \u00a36.6m two-year pay package to the Observer. \u201cThis time I mean it,\u201d joked Pennycook, 52. \u201cIf I had 10 years of executive life ahead of me, I would want to do that with the Co-op. This is the Co-op\u2019s time, but it is not the time for me to do another long stint as an executive.\u201d The Co-op said Murrells\u2019 pay package would remain the same despite the promotion. He earns a salary of \u00a3750,000 a year, but also participates in annual and long-term incentive plans that can each pay out up to 100% of his salary. Co-op members used a 2015 executive meeting to protest against high executive pay, and last year, Pennycook won plaudits for asking for a 60% cut in his multimillion-pound pay package. He agreed to cut his basic salary from \u00a31.25m to \u00a3750,000, which kicked in last summer, but he will no longer be around to work for the lowered bonus thresholds that came into effect in 2017. Pennycook is leaving as the Co-op looks to move on from its troubled financial past. Murrells is tasked with shaping the group\u2019s next steps as it looks to return to its roots by \u201cchampioning causes\u201d and \u201ctrading with an ethical heart and a social conscience\u201d. When Murrells took charge of the Co-op\u2019s food business, it was struggling following the \u00a31.57bn acquisition of Somerfield in 2008 and he set about reinventing it as a convenience chain, shedding many of the supermarkets it had acquired, a shift that paid off. However, discount rival Aldi overtook the Co-op to become the UK\u2019s fifth-largest grocer on Tuesday. Despite this, Co-op sales have risen by 2%, well ahead of its larger rivals, continuing a run of growth stretching back to July 2015, helping it maintain a 6% market share. Murrells said he was not concerned about supermarket league tables. \u201cThat\u2019s not what we do,\u201d he said. The Co-op had been closing more stores than it was opening in a drive to become more efficient, he added. Leighton said: \u201cSteve has transformed our food business and put it back at the heart of communities across the country. His leadership has seen the Co-op consistently outperform the market in food and he is the right and unanimous choice to now take the whole group forward for the next phase of our transformation.\u201d",

The former Tesco executive will replace the outgoing chief executive on the group board on 1 March.</p> <p>Pennycook will then leave the business at the end of March, after the company agreed to forego his six-month notice period, leading to speculation that he has another role lined up.</p> <p>\u201cRichard Pennycook saved our Co-op,\u201d said the Co-op chairman, Allan Leighton. \u201cIn three short years he has rescued and rebuilt our business, and restored pride to our 70,000 colleagues and 4.5 million members. We owe Richard a huge debt of gratitude and his place in Co-op history is secured.\u201d</p> <p>Pennycook will remain on the payroll, however, as he is being retained as an adviser for a fee of \u00a320,000 a month. The role will be focused on the fate of the mutual\u2019s 20% stake in the loss-making Co-op bank. Concerns about the bank\u2019s future have intensified in recent days after it announced that its capital ratio, a key measure of financial strength, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.investegate.co.uk/co-operative-bank--42rq-/rns/update-on-previous-guidance/201701260700071542V/\">would fall below 10%</a>. Leighton said the group was open-minded about the future of the bank stake and did not rule out being part of a plan to inject more capital into the beleaguered lender.</p> <p>Leighton described the handover to Murrells, who previously ran Tesco\u2019s One Stop convenience chain, as a \u201cclassic piece of succession\u201d. Pennycook said his next career step would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/jun/01/postalservice\">involve \u201cgoing plural\u201d</a> \u2013 a phrase popularised by Leighton in the 2000s, which refers to building a career out of multiple directorships.</p> <p>Pennycook first signalled plans to build a portfolio career when he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jun/25/morrisons-finance-director-quits-richard-pennycook\">resigned from Morrisons</a> in 2012. He joined the Co-op as interim finance director in the summer of 2013, but stepped up in 2014 to lead the group after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/mar/11/co-operative-group-chief-executive-euan-sutherland-resign\">Euan Sutherland quit</a>, following the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/mar/08/new-co-op-storm-pay-deals\">leaking of details</a> of his \u00a36.6m two-year pay package to the Observer. </p> <p>\u201cThis time I mean it,\u201d joked Pennycook, 52. \u201cIf I had 10 years of executive life ahead of me, I would want to do that with the Co-op. This is the Co-op\u2019s time, but it is not the time for me to do another long stint as an executive.\u201d</p> <p>The Co-op said Murrells\u2019 pay package would remain the same despite the promotion. He earns a salary of \u00a3750,000 a year, but also participates in annual and long-term incentive plans that can each pay out up to 100% of his salary.</p> <p>Co-op members used a 2015 executive meeting to protest against high executive pay, and last year, Pennycook won plaudits for <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/07/co-op-chief-pay-cut-2017-richard-pennycook\">asking for a 60% cut</a> in his multimillion-pound pay package. He agreed to cut his basic salary from \u00a31.25m to \u00a3750,000, which kicked in last summer, but he will no longer be around to work for the lowered bonus thresholds that came into effect in 2017.</p> <p>Pennycook is leaving as the Co-op looks to move on from its troubled financial past. Murrells is tasked with shaping the group\u2019s next steps as it looks to return to its roots by \u201cchampioning causes\u201d and \u201ctrading with an ethical heart and a social conscience\u201d. </p> <p>When Murrells took charge of the Co-op\u2019s food business, it was struggling following the \u00a31.57bn <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/jul/16/coop.somerfield\">acquisition of Somerfield</a> in 2008 and he set about reinventing it as a convenience chain, shedding many of the supermarkets it had acquired, a shift that paid off.</p> <p>However, discount rival <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/feb/07/aldi-uk-fifth-largest-supermarket\">Aldi overtook the Co-op</a> to become the UK\u2019s fifth-largest grocer on Tuesday. Despite this, Co-op sales have risen by 2%, well ahead of its larger rivals, continuing a run of growth stretching back to July 2015, helping it maintain a 6% market share.</p> <p>Murrells said he was not concerned about supermarket league tables. \u201cThat\u2019s not what we do,\u201d he said. The Co-op had been closing more stores than it was opening in a drive to become more efficient, he added.</p> <p>Leighton said: \u201cSteve has transformed our food business and put it back at the heart of communities across the country. His leadership has seen the Co-op consistently outperform the market in food and he is the right and unanimous choice to now take the whole group forward for the next phase of our transformation.\u201d</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Lloyds Banking Group has apologised for the impact of the \u00a3245m loan scam at HBOS and pledged to examine whether any of the small businesses affected should receive compensation. The bailed-out bank issued a statement following pressure from MPs and small businesses after the jail sentences totalling more than 47 years handed down last week to former senior HBOS manager Lynden Scourfield and five associates. Scourfield, who received a sentence of 11 years and three months, pleaded guilty to the scheme, which involved introducing his small business clients to consultant David Mills. Scourfield gave inappropriate loans to struggling businesses, which allowed Mills and his associates to profit from high consultancy fees while the banker was rewarded with foreign cruises and sex parties. Lloyds rescued HBOS during the 2008 crisis and the events took place before its period of ownership. It said after the convictions that it would consider reviews for compensation on the basis of any new information from the trial. It will now appoint an independent organisation to review whether it should pay compensation, in consultation with City regulator the Financial Conduct Authority. \u201cThe group deeply regrets that the criminal actions have caused such distress for a number of HBOS business customers,\u201d Lloyds said. \u201cCustomer cases will be considered afresh in light of all relevant evidence including new evidence that emerged during the trial. Since the investigation began in 2010, it was important that the group did not do or say anything that could subsequently prejudice the trial,\u201d the bank added. Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio, chief executive of Lloyds since 2011, also wrote to George Kerevan, the MP who chairs the all-party group for fair business banking, to pledge action for businesses that were affected. \u201cNow the trial is concluded we would like to express our deep regret and apologies to any customers who were directly affected by the criminal behaviour of these individuals,\u201d Horta-Os\u00f3rio said. \u201cWe are now able to take action to review the cases of all those who may have been affected and, where appropriate, to ensure they are fairly recompensed.\u201d Kerevan, an SNP MP, said he now wanted to ensure that the compensation system was robust. Taxpayers own just under 5% of the shares in Lloyds, which received a \u00a320bn bailout during its takeover of HBOS. At one point, taxpayers owned 43% of the shares in Lloyds, which is the UK\u2019s biggest mortgage lender and savings institution. A jury last week convicted Mills along with his wife Alison, and their associates Michael Bancroft and Tony Cartwright, for running the fraud between 2003 and 2007. Mark Dobson, another HBOS banker who used to work under Scourfield, was also found guilty. A seventh man, accountant Jonathan Cohen, was acquitted. The Mills owned a \u00a32m superyacht called Powder Monkey which the prosecution said was funded by the elaborate fraud scheme. The bank said it would \u201ccontact all those customers they have identified as potentially affected by the criminal activities and provide redress if appropriate\u201d. \u201cWhilst this should result in all these customers being contacted proactively, any customer who believes they may have been affected can also raise concerns direct with [the bank],\u201d it added. It said cases to be reviewed would involve customers who were referred by Scourfield and Dobson to Quayside Corporate Services, the business run by Mills, and those that were managed by it. This is likely to amount to about 50 businesses. But the bank said it would also review previous complaints and any new customer complaints related to the convicted former HBOS employees and QCS. Case study Paul and Nikki Turner, who spent 10 years investigating HBOS Reading, are \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d after Lloyds\u2019 announcement that customers of the crooked banker might now receive compensation. The Cambridge-based couple felt ignored when tried to raise the alarm about the way their business \u2013 publisher Zenith \u2013 was treated by Lynden Scourfield, the former HBOS banker jailed last week, and David Mills\u2019 Quayside Corporate Services. Their involvement with HBOS Reading began in 2003 when they took a \u00a3160,000 business loan from the operation and were introduced to QCS the following year when Scourfield started managing their account. They were required to pay fees \u2013 which they said eventually amounted to thousands of pounds \u2013 to QCS on a monthly basis. The pair \u2013 who set a group campaigning for fair treatment from banks for small business customers \u2013 asked for the relationship with QCS to end, the Turners said, but they said the fees kept being taken from their accounts. The bank made 22 attempts to repossess their bungalow in Cambridgeshire \u2013 where at the time they lived with their two daughters who are now 24 and 25 \u2013 which has been without hot water since 2006. \u201cI\u2019m cautiously optimistic about what happened today and glad the bank has said its going to do the right thing and compensate the victims,\u201d said Paul Turner. After the convictions last week, they felt they had a won a a battle. \u201cNow we might have won what we consider a war. We\u2019ve got to negotiate the surrender for the victims.\u201d \u201cThis is just about why it should have gone on so long,\u201d he said. The bank has not not yet aside funds to compensate customers. \u201cWe\u2019ve had to dedicate our lives to uncover this,\u201d said Nikki Turner. \u201cI don\u2019t think you can quantify 13 years of someone\u2019s life.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "UK tax burden will soar to highest level for 30 years, warns IFS", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The government is on course to impose steep cuts in public spending and increase taxes by the end of the decade to their highest level in 30 years to combat the UK\u2019s persistent budget deficit. But slower economic growth after the Brexit vote and lower than expected tax receipts will still leave the UK with one of the largest shortfalls in public spending in the developed world, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies. The leading tax and spending thinktank said downgrades in GDP growth over the next four years would strain the public finances, which are already on course to be \u00a313bn worse off in this financial year than forecast. Low levels of business investment and weak productivity growth were blamed for the economy\u2019s weaker outlook for the rest of the decade, which will force ministers to raise taxes and cut spending to reduce the deficit. About \u00a317bn of tax rises are planned over this parliament, pushing the tax share of GDP above 37% of national income for the first time since 1986\u201387. Ministers are also meant to find further cuts in spending on top of the 10% already sliced from service budgets since 2010. By 2019\u201320, departmental spending is expected to be 13% lower than it was in 2010 after inflation is taken into account, with cuts of about 40% to the justice, business, culture and environment budgets. Social care, which has climbed the political agenda amid a funding crisis, is another high-profile target for cuts over the next four years alongside schools in England, which were protected with health and pension spending until this year. Paul Johnson, the IFS director, said even without the downturn in the economic outlook after the referendum, Britons were facing three parliaments of austerity. \u201cFor all the focus on Brexit, the public finances in the next few years look set to be defined by the spending cuts announced by George Osborne,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cCuts to day-to-day public service spending are due to accelerate while the tax burden continues to rise. Even so the new chancellor may not find it all that easy to meet his target of eliminating the budget deficit in the next parliament. \u201cEven on central forecasts that is going to require extending austerity towards the mid-2020s. If the economy does less well than hoped then we may see yet another set of fiscal rules consigned to the dustbin.\u201d Highlighting the pressure on the chancellor, Philip Hammond, before his first budget next month, the IFS\u2019s annual assessment of the public finances found that Britain\u2019s ageing population and increasing demands on the NHS could blow an even bigger hole in the government budget over the next two parliaments. \u201cTaking into account possible negative effects from lower growth, the government may need to enact further measures worth \u00a334bn [in 2016-17 terms] in order to eliminate the deficit in the next parliament,\u201d the report said. A Treasury spokeswoman said the government was committed to repairing the public finances so the UK lived within its means. She said: \u201cThat has required some difficult decisions on spending, but we are determined to deliver efficient public services which provide maximum value for every pound of taxpayers\u2019 money.\u201d Hammond said in the autumn statement last year that he was able to find funds to bolster public investment spending back above pre-crisis levels, with much of the extra cash to be spent on transport infrastructure. The chancellor also said the government still planned to pay for large giveaways in the form of a higher income tax personal allowance at the basic and higher rate. If Hammond maintains freezes on fuel duty, the combined giveaway will total \u00a34.25bn a year by 2020. The IFS said: \u201cPublic spending, especially on health, pensions and overseas aid will be higher as a share of national income than in 2007-08, while spending on schools, defence and \u2013 in particular\u2013 public order and safety will be lower.\u201d The Liberal Democrats\u2019 Treasury spokeswoman, Susan Kramer, said: \u201cCut after cut will be the new normal for this Conservative government, even before the effects of Brexit hit. Failure on the deficit, high taxes and rising prices. It is those on low and middle incomes who will be hit hardest.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 7 February 2017 to correct the figure needed to eliminate the budget deficit from \u00a340bn to \u00a334bn",

      "bodyText": "Despite US markets hitting new highs as the Trump rally returned, it was a different picture in Europe. UK markets ended in positive territory, with the FTSE 100 helped by a weaker pound and a strong performance from precious metal miners. Germany\u2019s Dax also moved higher but France was under pressure on concerns about the presidential election, while the latest Greece developments pushed up the country\u2019s bond yields again. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 14.07 points or 0.2% at 7186.22 Germany\u2019s Dax rose 0.34% to 11,549.44 France\u2019s Cac closed down 0.49% at 4754.47 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 0.17% to 18,662.61 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 0.28% at 9331.5 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.42% to 623.37 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 34 points or 0.17%. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Back with Greece, and Monday\u2019s IMF meeting appears to have reinforced the government\u2019s resolve not to give in to more demands for austerity, reports our correspondent Helena Smith: The Greek government has long argued that the country has been hostage to the deep differences that exist over fiscal targets between its creditors. In recent months as the rhetoric has crescendoed it is a claim that has been openly used to account for the foot dragging in implementation of reforms. Now that a split within the IMF itself has also come to light, cadres in the ruling Syriza party are saying it will only strengthen the leftist-led coalition\u2019s determination to stick to its guns and not forge ahead with more painful austerity. The government spokesman\u2019s description of IMF demands as \u201cillogical\u201d is indicative, they say, of Athens now digging in. \u201cThere is a lot of behind-the-scenes movement to see where the points of convergence are,\u201d said one. \u201cBut to ask us to strangle our economy further and take additional measures once the bailout ends when our [economic] progress has been openly acknowledged is totally absurd.\u201d Thursday\u2019s Euro working group will be seminal in seeing if a solution can be found to break the deadlock and conclude the review by February 20 when euro area finance ministers next meet in eurogroup session. Creditors are now saying it is up to the Greek finance ministry to take the initiative with announcement of new reforms, not least further broadening of the personal income tax base by lowering the tax threshold to \u20ac6000 \u2013 a measure that would bring around 1.5 million Greeks currently surviving on very low wages and pensions into the tax fold. Euclid Tsakalotos, the Greek finance minister, has opposed the measure amid widespread rumour that he will hand in his resignation if forced to rescind. The circular nature of Greece\u2019s debt crisis is such that even with borrowing costs rocketing and yields on ten-year bonds soaring, the government is still confident that a compromise formula will be found with several leading figures repeating prime minister Alexis Tsipras\u2019 conviction that the review will wrap up sooner rather than later with the IMF ultimately remaining in the programme even if only in an advisory role. UK markets have closed higher, helped by the weakness in the pound, with the FTSE 100 up 0.2% and the FTSE 250 closing at a new high, of 18,559, up 0.99%. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: Stock markets are back on the rise, with the FTSE benefitting from a weaker pound, and US markets reaching record highs despite a widening trade deficit. The FTSE is enjoying a strong recovery today, with the deterioration in the pound helping to boost the index. Once more it is the gold producers heading up the leaderboard, with Randgold and Fresnillo rallying sharply despite today representing an off day for the gold price. Despite the weakness we saw earlier in the week, it is clear that investors see any pullback as an opportunity to get into the Trump rally, with the Dow and Nasdaq hitting a fresh all-time intraday high in early trading. The pound remained subdued against a resurgent dollar today, despite BoE member Forbes speculating that the MPC should seek to raise rates even with the Brexit uncertainty. Improved inflation data across the world has raised suspicions that we could see the likes of the ECB and BoE tout a more hawkish tone. Today\u2019s comments stand in stark contrast to the accommodative stance preferred across Europe as a means to ward against any adverse economic effects of the Brexit process. The bank could end up choosing between respecting its price stability mandate or providing a supportive policy framework for a downturn that may never come. The worries about Greece\u2019s debt problems following the signs of a split among the IMF board members continues to hit the country\u2019s bonds. Yields on its 10 year bonds are at 7.8% while the two year yield is at 10%: The pound is still lower against a strong dollar - the US currency being boosted by Fed comments suggesting a rate hike before long - but it is well off its lowest levels. Sterling has recovered some lost ground after the news of a vote on a Brexit deal in parliament, as well as the comments from Bank of England policymaker Kirstin Forbes that UK rates may soon need to rise. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: As the Brexit debate rages on, news that MPs will get a vote on a deal, before the European parliament and covering \u2018not only the withdrawal arrangements but also the future relationship with the European Union took the edge off the pound\u2019s decline as the afternoon went on. Sterling was also helped by comments from the Bank of England\u2019s Kristin Forbes, who stated that she believes a rate hike might be need to prevent inflation from getting too unwieldy. This could only erase a small part of the pound\u2019s losses, however, with sterling still down 0.7% against the dollar. The euro, meanwhile, maintained its half a percent drop against the greenback, spooked by both Draghi\u2019s pro-stimulus comments yesterday and the truly terrifying prospect of President Marine Le Pen. The Le Pen issue meant that, while the FTSE and DAX rose 0.6% and 0.4% respectively, the CAC slipped by 0.4%, the French index finding itself back under 4800 once again. Meanwhile the FTSE 250 is heading towards a new peak. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: After weak start European stock markets are slightly more buoyant today, helped in part by a weaker euro and a weaker pound, helping push the DAX and FTSE100 higher on the day, with the FTSE 100 hitting a two week high and the FTSE 250 set to post a new record close, begging the question, are UK stocks becoming a safe haven for European political risk? Back with Greece, and the country is doing better than the IMF suggests. That is the view of Eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem, who said the IMF\u2019s report was outdated due to recent Greek growth, and he was surprised by the harshness of the fund\u2019s comments. He said that there had been some easing of Greece\u2019s debt but more was needed. But he saw no forgiveness of Greek debt, only the possibility of easier repayment terms. Over on Wall Street, and US markets are on the rise again. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has hit a new record of 20,126, up 74 points, while the Nasdaq Composite is also in uncharted territory again. Investors have been encouraged by the trade deficit in December coming in better than expected, ignoring a fall in fourth quarter income at General Motors. Over in the UK parliament, a concession from the government: Brexit minister David Jones has announced that MPs will get a vote on the final deal to leave the EU before it is concluded. More at our politics live blog here. The comments about a possible rise in interest rates from the Bank of England\u2019s Kirstin Forbes has given some support to the pound. It has erased some of its losses against the dollar, and is now down 0.67% at $1.2386 having earlier fallen as low as $1.2348 this morning. And against the euro, sterling has now edged up 0.02% to \u20ac1.1597 after dropping to \u20ac1.1576. Bank of England policymaker Kristin Forbes has suggested she is getting closer to voting for a rate rise to stop inflation rising too high. In a speech in Leeds, she is saying the economy had outperformed gloomy post-referendum expectations and continued to hold up well. Here\u2019s the key comment from Forbes: \u201cIf the real economy remains solid and the pickup in the nominal data continues, this could soon suggest an increase in Bank Rate. \u201cIt is worth highlighting that an increase in interest rates, however, given today\u2019s extremely low level of Bank Rate, and the substantial amount of monetary stimulus that is already in place through a variety of programs, would still leave a substantial amount of monetary support for the economy\u201d Forbes had also become the latest economist to raise the question of whether her profession might have been smarter not to factor in any leave vote impact at all for the UK economy in 2016. Forbes notes how much actual developments in the second half of 2016 matched the Bank\u2019s economic forecasts made in May last year on the basis on a remain vote. Forbes\u2019 comments come after her colleague on the committee, Andy Haldane, said last month that it was fair to describe economics as being in crisis given a series of forecasting errors before and after the financial crash. He described the collapse of Lehman Brothers as the economics profession\u2019s \u201cMichael Fish moment\u201d - a reference to when the BBC weather forecaster predicted in 1987 that the UK would avoid a hurricane that went on to devastate large parts of southern England. Forbes said in her speech in Leeds - where she is talking about the Bank\u2019s latest outlook in the inflation report - that \u201cthere is certainly fodder for criticism\u201d. \u201cThe vast majority of economists and forecasters expected the UK economy to slow immediately after the UK voted to leave the European Union, with some even predicting an outright recession. Most put substantial weight on the evidence that growth, and especially investment, tends to slow sharply in the face of heightened uncertainty. I was on the more optimistic end of the forecasters, but I still expected to see at least some softening. \u201cBut this slowdown has not occurred - and it has now been over 7 months since the June vote...Growth may still slow as higher inflation reduces real incomes, or if negative supply effects related to the UK\u2019s departure from the European Union build over time. Signs of such a slowdown starting soon, however, are as yet few and far between.\u201d But she, like several City economists of late, was quick to point out that the forecasts made for the UK voting to stay in the EU had turned out to be close to the mark. Referring to Haldane\u2019s Michael Fish remark, Forbes said: \u201cYou may have heard that UK economic forecasters have recently been less accurate than weathermen. But I will show you that the Bank of England has actually done quite well - that is, if you compare the UK\u2019s recent performance to what was predicted in May based on the assumption that the UK would vote to remain in the European Union... ... The bottom line: the real economy, including the labour market, have performed largely as forecast last spring. Most economic measures (except investment) have matched or slightly outperformed our May expectations based on a Remain vote. The UK economy appears to have been largely resilient to Brexit uncertainty. The main exception is sterling and the nominal data - which indicate sharply higher inflation than expected last spring\u201d As for why the economy had proved so resilient to the vote, Forbes listed several possible factors and said the UK had benefited from a \u201cSeries of Fortunate Events\u201d in the second half of 2016. Supporting factors included Bank of England action after the vote, including a rate cut, the pound\u2019s depreciation, a stronger global economy, a higher minimum wage and \u201cless negative effects of heightened uncertainty than expected\u201d. Talking about the Bank\u2019s forecasts for growth to be 2% this year but slow next year, for inflation to rise and for unemployment to edge up, Forbes said for her the key risks to that view were: how sterling\u2019s depreciation affects inflation dynamics, how wages evolve, and how consumersrespond to slower real income growth. Reuters\u2019 Jamie McGeever points out that US trade deficit actually narrowed last year, as a proportion of the economy - and despite a strengthening dollar. Here\u2019s some instant reaction to the US trade data (no word from the president yet, I\u2019m afraid...) Donald Trump has made trade a massive issue, so the latest US trade figures are going to be particularly closely watched. And the headline news is that America\u2019s trade deficit with the rest of the world has hit a four-year high in 2016, at $502.3bn, up from $500.4bn in 2015. That included a $347bn trade deficit with China, and a $146bn deficit with the European Union. But... the figures also show that America\u2019s trade deficit narrowed in December, to $44.3bn, thanks to a rise in exports. With the euro still wallowing below $1.07, analysts are blaming political uncertainty in Europe. Analysts at Rabobank say the French presidential election is to blame. \u201cAlthough opinion polls suggest that (Far-right National Front Leader Marine) Le Pen will not win the second round of the French presidential election in May, polls have wrongly picked the winners of both socialist and republican primaries.\u201d Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says yesterday\u2019s dovish comments from ECB president Draghi aren\u2019t helping the euro either. Draghi\u2019s comments yesterday about the need for stimulus in the Eurozone despite rising inflation, alongside the damage the currency would suffer if Marine Le Pen becomes the next French president, are dragging it lower. Overall if seems that the pound is struggling the most, however, dipping by 0.2% against the euro having been 0.3% up just after the bell. One point... Although the rise in Greece\u2019s 10-year bond yields is significant, it doesn\u2019t actually affect its borrowing costs yet (because the country is in a bailout programme). As Dan Davies of Frontline Analysts reminds me... the short-dated two-year Treasury bonds are a better measure of the current borrowing costs (They\u2019ve spiked even more sharply, to around 10%) Ten-year bond yields show how much confidence \u2018the market\u2019 has in a country\u2019s long-term credit-worthiness. If investors are demanding much higher yields to hold the debt (yields rise when prices fall), then they\u2019re more worried. Athens-based journalist Omaira Gill tweets: The Greek government has now weighed in on the ongoing row over its bailout. Spokesman Dimitris Tzanakopoulos said the government hopes for a \u2018positive conclusion\u2019 to the long-running (and bogged down) review of the programme. He also insisted that Athens will not swallow additional austerity measures, and still hopes to be included in the eurozone\u2019s stimulus programme soon. Tzanakopoulos says: \u201cThe government is aspiring for a deal that will lead to the country\u2019s inclusion in the (ECB\u2019s) quantitative easing programme. The government\u2019s position is clear and it has been expressed categorically ... our aim is to not yield to illogical demands by the International Monetary Fund, which insists on legislating precautionary (austerity) measures after the programme ends.\u201d The UK Treasury has responded to today\u2019s warning that Britain\u2019s tax burden will soon hit a three-decade high: \u201cThe government is committed to repairing the public finances and living within our means so that we can build an economy that works for all. That has required some difficult decisions on spending, but we are determined to deliver efficient public services which provide maximum value for every pound of taxpayers\u2019 money.\u201d As former Treasury head honcho Rupert Harrison points out, this means even more austerity.... Back to Greece...and the country\u2019s benchmark borrowing costs have spiked to their highest level of this year. The yield, or interest rate, on Greek 10-year bonds has jumped to 8% this morning - after the IMF revealed its board is split over how much austerity the country should swallow. That\u2019s the highest level since last October, and puts Greek debt firmly in the \u2018danger zone\u2019. The IMF\u2019s repeated warnings that Greece\u2019s debt burden is unsustainable, and its persistent reluctance to join the latest bailout, is worrying investors. Mihir Kapadia, CEO and Founder of Sun Global Investments, has a good take: \u201cThe European debt crisis never went away \u2013 a fix was implemented and the can was kicked down the road but the problem came back in 2016, particularly in the case of Italy and Greece In the meantime, the fractures in these and other countries have grown as the economies have shrunk or barely grown with the growth of extremist, protectionist parties which are a threat to the liberal values. 2017 has a number of elections including in France, Netherlands and Germany which represent significant risks for the Eurozone. . In particular Greece is renegotiating its bailout at a time when the economy continues to struggle and living standards have plummeted and the country is in the frontline of a migration crisis. The Troika of Greek Creditors, the IMF, EU and ECB face a very difficult situation. They do not want to write off but Greece is in no position to pay. There is a rift even within the IMF about fiscal targets set for Greece. Some within the IMF have called them unsustainable, seriously questioning the country\u2019s ability to generate and sustain a surplus and long term growth.\u201d Greece\u2019s two-year bonds are also spiralling higher this morning, showing renewed concerns over its bailout. Here\u2019s more details of the IFS\u2019s grim assessment of the UK economy: Newsflash: Britain\u2019s tax burden is set to hit its highest level in three decades, to help fix the black hole in the UK public finances That\u2019s according to the well-respected Institute for Fiscal Studies, which has just published its new \u2018Green budget\u2019. It shows that Britain\u2019s tax take is on track to hit 37% of national income by 2019-2020, a level not seen since 1986. Paul Johnson, Director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, gives a very gloomy assessment of the UK economy: \u201cFor all the focus on Brexit the public finances in the next few years look set to be defined by the spending cuts announced by George Osborne. Cuts to day-to-day public service spending are due to accelerate while the tax burden continues to rise. Even so the new chancellor may not find it all that easy to meet his target of eliminating the budget deficit in the next parliament. Even on central forecasts that is going to require extending austerity towards the mid-2020s. If the economy does less well than hoped then we may see yet another set of fiscal rules consigned to the dustbin.\u201d Here\u2019s our news story: And here\u2019s more details: In yesterday\u2019s liveblog, we reported how British businesses are already suffering a negative impact from the Brexit vote. Today\u2019s news is more encouraging -- the UK could be the fastest growing economy between now and 2050, according to new research from PwC. But there\u2019s a big \u201cif\u201d -- Britain needs to secure successful trade deals to ease the disruption from Brexit, and keep pace with fast-growing developing markets. My colleague Katie Allen explains: PwC sets out the UK\u2019s prospects in its latest report into how the world economy will look in 2050. Using models that analyse population trends, investment, education and technological progress, PwC economists expect six of the seven largest economies by 2050 will be emerging markets, led by China. They see the UK economy remaining in the top 10, slipping down one spot from ninth place now to 10th in purchasing power parity (PPP) terms, which adjusts for price differences between countries to provide a measure of the volume of goods and services produced by an economy. France is forecast to drop out of the top 10, to 12th place in 2050, while Germanyis forecast to fall from fifth place to ninth. Mexico is the only newcomer to the top 10 in 2050. More details of the report are here. French bonds are coming under more pressure this morning too. This selloff has pushed the gap between Paris and Berlin\u2019s respective borrowing costs to a four-year high. The cost of insuring French bonds against default is also rising; traders have heard Marine Le Pen pledge to take the country out of the euro. Kit Juckes, currency expert at Societe Generale, expects political worries to gnaw at the euro over the next few months. We expect the euro/US dollar exchange rate to reach the low for the year sometime in the next three months, during the French political election campaign, at a level close to parity. If Marine Le Pen doesn\u2019t win the election, we expect a very significant Euro rebound through the second half of 2017 as valuations and capital flows dominate. But with M Fillon showing no signs of leaving the fray, M Bayrou still lurking in the shadows, and M Hamon still making overtures to M Melenchon, the only candidate confident of making it to the second round is \u201cMarine\u201d. The US dollar is enjoying a little surge this morning, sending the pound and euro reeling in its wake. Sterling has dropped almost a whole cent to $1.237, a two-week low. The euro is also taking a bath, down 0.7% at $1.067. Neil Wilson of ETX Capital has a theory: Traders in the City seem to have woken up to the prospect of the Fed tightening interest rates quicker than they\u2019d thought, after Philly Fed president Patrick Harker said he would support hiking rates in March. That\u2019s thrown the cat among the doves a bit as the last FOMC meeting suggested the Fed was not likely to raise rates until the summer. The rally in safe haven assets seems to have stalled and traders are piling back into long dollar positions. Dublin MEP Nessa Childers is pleased that most IMF board members believe Greece\u2019s fiscal targets should be cut, to just 1.5 % of GDP. Newsflash: UK house prices fell (yes, fell) by 0.9% month-on-month in January, according to new figures from the Halifax. Economists had expected prices to remain flat. On an annual basis, prices were 5.9% higher, with the average house costing just over \u00a3220,000. Greece\u2019s government debt is falling in value this morning. The yield, or interest rates, on 10-year Greek bonds has jumped to 8%, from 7.85% last night. That means its price has fallen, with investors calculating that there\u2019s a greater risk that Athens defaults. Short-term Greek debt is also under real pressure, sending yields spiking higher: The divisions among the IMF\u2019s board over Greece\u2019s bailout highlight its long-running row with Europe, points out the Financial Times: The fund did not reveal which board members had objected. But the public statement illustrates the sensitivity surrounding the continuing Greek bailout programme. It also points to one of the main political challenges facing Christine Lagarde, the IMF\u2019s managing director who has battled with European leaders over the Greek debt issue for almost two years. The IMF has been the target of criticism since first joining the EU-led bailout of Greece in 2010, particularly over the strict fiscal targets it set early on. Economists have also blamed the IMF and its European partners for not doing enough to reduce Greece\u2019s long-term debt load. But the IMF has for the past two years insisted that Germany and other eurozone members needed to do more to tackle that debt. By labelling Greece\u2019s public debt unsustainable it has also made its own financial contribution to a bailout impossible under its own rules unless Athens\u2019 debt is either restructured or forgiven in part. The IMF has also made its traditional call for Greece to receive fresh debt relief. Today\u2019s statement says: Most Directors considered that, despite Greece\u2019s enormous sacrifices and European partners\u2019 generous support, further relief may well be required to restore debt sustainability. They stressed the need to calibrate such relief on realistic assumptions about Greece\u2019s ability to generate sustained surpluses and long term growth. Directors underlined, however, that debt relief needs to be complemented with strong policy implementation to restore growth and sustainability. A split has opened up at the International Monetary Fund over the terms of Greece\u2019s bailout, raising new doubts over its participation in the rescue plan. In its latest annual review of the Greek economy, the IMF revealed that its board members are in disagreement over whether Athens should enforce even more austerity to satisfy its lenders. \u201cMost\u201d of the 24-strong group agreed that Greece was on track to achieve a surplus of 1.5% of GDP, and should not make further cuts. However, another group on the board argued that Athens needed to tighten further to push its surplus up to 3.5% of GDP, the level agreed in its last bailout. In a rare statement, the IMF says that: Most Executive Directors agreed with the thrust of the staff appraisal while some Directors had different views on the fiscal path and debt sustainability..... Most Directors agreed that Greece does not require further fiscal consolidation at this time, given the impressive adjustment to date which is expected to bring the medium-term primary fiscal surplus to around 1\u00bd percent of GDP, while some Directors favored a surplus of 3\u00bd percent of GDP by 2018. Here\u2019s the statement: IMF Executive Board Concludes 2016 Article IV Consultation, and Discusses Ex Post Evaluation of Greece\u2019s 2012 Extended Fund Facility IMF board meetings are usually kept confidential, so we wouldn\u2019t normally know whether decisions are unanimous or not. The unusual decision to reveal the split highlights the divisions over Greece within the IMF, which hasn\u2019t joined the country\u2019s third bailout, agreed in August 2015. Last month, a leaked report showed that the IMF believes Greece\u2019s debt pile is on track to swell to almost 300% of GDP by 2060 -- a profoundly unsustainable level. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Political tensions are rising in Europe, and exerting pressure on the financial markets. The possibility of a far-right win in France\u2019s presidential election this spring has pushed French bonds to their weakest level in 18 months, widening the gap with \u2018safe-haven\u2019 Germany. If the eurozone was totally secure, French debt would be as safe as Germany\u2019s - but right now, investors seem anxious. An opinion poll showing that Angela Merkel\u2019s CDU party had fallen to second place, behind the Social Democrats, has also caused jitters. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets explains: European markets got off to a poor start to the week yesterday, slipping to seven week lows, with investors once again reluctant to try their luck against a backdrop of rising political risk, on both sides of the Atlantic. While US President Trump has extended his one man crusade to the US court system, after his travel ban was overturned, any notion of a more stable political outlook in Europe took another twist over the weekend, as a narrowing of opinion polls in Germany, cast doubt on Angela Merkel remaining as Chancellor later this year, while Marine Le Pen launched her bid for the French Presidency as well. In the UK, the Institute for Fiscal Studies will publish its \u2018Green Budget\u2019, outlining the challenges facing chancellor Philip Hammond as he draws up new tax and spending plans (the real budget is on 8th March). The Halifax building society is releasing its latest house price figure at 8.30am GMT. On the corporate front, oil giant BP, travel firm FirstGroup and model maker Hornby are reporting results.",

The government spokesman\u2019s description of IMF demands as \u201cillogical\u201d is indicative, they say, of Athens now digging in. \u201cThere is a lot of behind-the-scenes movement to see where the points of convergence are,\u201d said one. \u201cBut to ask us to strangle our economy further and take additional measures once the bailout ends when our [economic] progress has been openly acknowledged is totally absurd.\u201d </p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"531eb5a79665893f03bc337881fa403eea7e221c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/531eb5a79665893f03bc337881fa403eea7e221c/899_146_4023_2413/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Greek finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Greek finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Isopix/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <blockquote> <p>Thursday\u2019s Euro working group will be seminal in seeing if a solution can be found to break the deadlock and conclude the review by February 20 when euro area finance ministers next meet in eurogroup session. </p> <p>Creditors are now saying it is up to the Greek finance ministry to take the initiative with announcement of new reforms, not least further broadening of the personal income tax base by lowering the tax threshold to \u20ac6000 \u2013 a measure that would bring around 1.5 million Greeks currently surviving on very low wages and pensions into the tax fold. Euclid Tsakalotos, the Greek finance minister, has opposed the measure amid widespread rumour that he will hand in his resignation if forced to rescind. </p> <p>The circular nature of Greece\u2019s debt crisis is such that even with borrowing costs rocketing and yields on ten-year bonds soaring, the government is still confident that a compromise formula will be found with several leading figures repeating prime minister Alexis Tsipras\u2019 conviction that the review will wrap up sooner rather than later with the IMF ultimately remaining in the programme even if only in an advisory role. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5899f20ae4b0dde15c90a837\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-02-07T16:53:17.377Z\">4.53pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>UK markets have closed higher, helped by the weakness in the pound, with the FTSE 100 up 0.2% and the FTSE 250 closing at a new high, of 18,559, up 0.99%.

Improved inflation data across the world has raised suspicions that we could see the likes of the ECB and BoE tout a more hawkish tone. Today\u2019s comments stand in stark contrast to the accommodative stance preferred across Europe as a means to ward against any adverse economic effects of the Brexit process.

I was on the more optimistic end of the forecasters, but I still expected to see at least some softening. </p> <p>\u201cBut this slowdown has not occurred - and it has now been over 7 months since the June vote...Growth may still slow as higher inflation reduces real incomes, or if negative supply effects related to the UK\u2019s departure from the European Union build over time. Signs of such a slowdown starting soon, however, are as yet few and far between.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>But she, like several City economists of late, was quick to point out that the forecasts made for the UK voting to stay in the EU had turned out to be close to the mark.</p> <p>Referring to Haldane\u2019s Michael Fish remark, Forbes said:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cYou may have heard that UK economic forecasters have recently been less accurate than weathermen. But I will show you that the Bank of England has actually done quite well - that is, if you compare the UK\u2019s recent performance to what was predicted in May based on the assumption that the UK would vote to remain in the European Union...</p> <p>... The bottom line: the real economy, including the labour market, have performed largely as forecast last spring. Most economic measures (except investment) have matched or slightly outperformed our May expectations based on a Remain vote. The UK economy appears to have been largely resilient to Brexit uncertainty. The main exception is sterling and the nominal data - which indicate sharply higher inflation than expected last spring\u201d</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8fa3d24f39080f96496e5443a388b679bad63ad0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8fa3d24f39080f96496e5443a388b679bad63ad0/0_0_949_742/500.jpg\" alt=\"Bank of England forecasts\" width=\"500\" height=\"391\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A chart from Kristin Forbes\u2019 speech</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bank of England</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As for why the economy had proved so resilient to the vote, Forbes listed several possible factors and said the UK had benefited from a \u201cSeries of Fortunate Events\u201d in the second half of 2016.

It is joining the chorus of voices expressing concern about executive pay in a year in which large numbers of companies are putting their bonus deals to a binding vote \u2013 rather than an advisory one \u2013 at their AGMs. \u201cWe voted against two-thirds of remuneration reports that were proposed last year,\u201d said Adam Matthews, head of engagement for the Church Commissioners \u2013 an investment fund manager that is a member of the Church Investors Group \u2013 and Church of England Pensions Board. \u201cWe\u2019re saying that when we see pay policies that aren\u2019t justified we will vote against them. We want to see greater use of discretion by remuneration committees.\u201d The Church Commissioners manage \u00a37bn of the Church of England\u2019s investments, and help funds dioceses and parishes. Major institutional investors such as BlackRock \u2013 the world\u2019s biggest fund manager \u2013 and Standard Life have also warned companies that they are on alert for excessive pay deals for company executives. Investors have already scored a victory this year when Imperial Brands, maker of Gauloises and John Player cigarettes, scrapped a pay rise for its chief executive Alison Cooper. Matthews said this year\u2019s AGM season was important because of the number of binding votes on pay policies, which must be put forward for shareholders\u2019 approval every three years. It has been estimated that about two-thirds of companies in the FTSE 100 have to put their pay policies to a vote this year. Annual pay deals are voted on separately each year, but this is only advisory. He said there was \u201ccollective concern\u201d among investors about pay deals this year, which are being put to a vote at a time when the government is consulting on changes to the way the executive remuneration system operates. The green paper \u2013 open for discussion for three months \u2013 was launched after Theresa May pledged to reform big business during her campaign to become Conservative leader. It asked if companies should publish their pay ratio \u2013 the gap between the chief executive and the wider workforce. In 2015 chief executives received 128 times the average pay of their staff, it said. The letter to FTSE 350 companies, signed by James Corah, secretary to the Church Investors Group, urges companies to provide information on pay ratios. It also warned that it intends to focus on climate change, water use and the way companies treat their employees. Edward Carter, a canon who chairs the Church Investors Group, said: \u201cOur members are committed to playing an active and productive role in advocating for improved governance at this important time of reform.\u201d The Church Commissioners\u2019 largest stakes are in banking groups such as Lloyds and HSBC, supermarket group Tesco and pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca. Matthews also warns that the investment group keeps a close interest in climate change. In the past the Church has challenged BP and Shell to take responsibility for their carbon footprints and limit their contribution to global warming by submitting shareholder resolution calling on the energy companies \u201cto adapt their businesses over the long term for a low carbon economy\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "England\u2019s housing market is broken, the government has admitted, with home ownership a \u201cdistant dream\u201d for young families, as it unveiled a white paper promising a fresh wave of home building. The communities secretary, Sajid Javid, told the House of Commons that average house prices had jumped to 7.5 times average incomes and rents in many places swallowed more than half of take-home pay. He placed the blame almost entirely on low rates of house building, telling MPs that the number of home completions in England has been lower than anywhere else in Europe, relative to the population, for the last three decades. Javid said house building needs to rise to 225,000 to 275,000 units a year compared with 190,000 built in 2016 and as little as 95,000 following the financial crisis. But the white paper warns that the density of development in England\u2019s urban areas will have to increase, and home sizes may shrink. \u201cOur housing market is broken,\u201d he told MPs. \u201cWe have to build more, of the right homes in the right places, and we have to start right now.\u201d Every local council will be forced to publish projections for local house building, developers will be forced to use-or-lose planning permission once granted, older people will be given incentives to move out of underused big homes, and tenants will be given extra protection. Labour\u2019s housing spokesman, John Healey MP, condemned the white paper as \u201cfeeble beyond belief\u201d. \u201cIs that it?\u201d he said after Javid gave his statement to the Commons. \u201cHis statement will desperately disappoint millions of people struggling to cope with the cost of the housing crisis. \u201cAfter seeing home ownership in freefall over seven years of Conservative government, this is a white flag not a white paper. It confirms the Tories have given up on home ownership and have no plan to fix the country\u2019s housing crisis.\u201d Javid said there was \u201cno single bullet\u201d that would solve the crisis, but that the government could act to speed up house building across many fronts. The housing white paper, entitled \u201cFixing our broken housing market\u201d, introduces new ways of assessing housing need, putting the onus on local councils to avoid \u201cducking difficult decisions\u201d and encouraging them to use compulsory purchase orders, he said. But he stepped back from giving the go-ahead to build on greenbelt land. \u201cThis [paper] will not entail recklessly ripping up our countryside,\u201d Javid said, adding that not a single restriction on greenbelt building would be lifted. The white paper confirmed the government would press ahead with a controversial ban on letting agency fees for tenants \u2013 but there is still no firm date for when this will happen. In November 2016, the government announced it would introduce a ban, which means tenants will no longer have to pay fees that can run into hundreds of pounds when they sign a new tenancy agreement. But some felt at the time that there was a worrying lack of detail. The white paper states: \u201cWe will consult early this year, ahead of bringing forward legislation as soon as parliamentary time allows, to ban letting agent fees to tenants.\u201d Among the main proposals in the white paper are: Every local authority will have to draw up and regularly review an \u201chonest assessment\u201d of local housing need. Developers forced to build within two years of gaining planning permission, or see it lapse. Currently permission lapses after three years. An expanded and more flexible affordable homes programme, for housing associations and local authorities, with \u00a37.1bn of already announced funding. \u201cWe will provide clarity over future rent levels. In return, we expect them to build significantly more affordable homes over the current parliament.\u201d Smaller building firms will be given assistance to expand, including support for off-site construction, where parts of homes are assembled in a factory. An end to \u201cleasehold abuse\u201d by which home buyers are locked into leases with spiralling ground rents. Encouragement for \u201cbuild to let\u201d where private companies build large-volume rental flats for tenants. The white paper envisages urban areas in England becoming more densely populated than ever, with cities expected to build upwards rather than outwards, and for homes to get smaller. New-build homes and apartments in England are already among the smallest in Europe, but the white paper suggests that the size of homes could shrink even further. The white paper says that a \u201cone size fits all\u201d approach on minimum space standards may not fit modern needs, citing developer Pocket Homes \u2013 which builds flats that are only 400sq ft (37sq metres). It said the government would review the Nationally Described Space Standard so that there could be \u201cgreater local housing choice\u201d. The growing gap between planning permission granted for new homes, and the number actually built, is also highlighted by the white paper. While in 2007-08 the gap was only 25,000 homes, by 2015-16 it had grown to nearly 100,000. The paper says: \u201cThere is concern that it may be in the interest of speculators and developers to snap up land for housing and then sit back for a while as prices continue to rise.\u201d The paper promises a carrot-and-stick approach, with local authorities planning departments beefed-up and given extra powers to speed up development. But in a return to more centralised control of building, the white paper warns councils that \u201cwhere the number of homes being built is below expectations, the new housing delivery test will ensure that action is taken\u201d. Four out of 10 local authorities, it warned, \u201cdo not have a plan that meets the projected growth in households in their area\u201d. Building on brownfield sites will be at the core of the government\u2019s plans. It said it would release enough land to build 160,000 new homes during this parliament, and expected local authorities to do the same. The share prices of all the major housebuilders leaped despite the promise to help smaller firms. Persimmon, Barratts and Taylor Wimpey were all among the top 10 highest risers on the London stock exchange as Javid made his statement to the Commons. Campaign groups said the white paper offered little to the growing number of private renters. Dan Wilson Craw of Generation Rent said: \u201cSajid Javid has the right analysis about the plight of renters, but his white paper has failed to offer us anything of substance. \u201cBy limiting longer tenancies to new purpose-built private rented homes, the government has offered renters the bare minimum. The vast majority of tenants will remain in existing properties, with no certainty over their home beyond the next 12 months. \u201cUntil the government builds enough to overcome the housing shortage, high rents will continue to stifle living standards. Renters on stagnant wages need homes that cost no more than a third of their income, not ones let at 80% of the market rent, with a sticker that says \u2018affordable\u2019.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "UK house prices fell at the turn of the year, the first monthly drop since last August, according to Britain\u2019s biggest mortgage lender. Experts said the figures pointed to a market slowdown in 2017, although Halifax said a shortage of houses for sale should prevent a steep slump in prices. The average price of a home fell by 0.9% to \u00a3220,260 between December and January. The previous monthly decline was 0.3% in August 2016, according to Halifax. The annual rate of growth in the three months to January fell to 5.7% from 6.5% in the three months to December, and is well below the 10% peak last March. Last week, rival mortgage lender Nationwide reported that house prices grew by 4.3% in January, the weakest annual rate since November 2015. Samuel Tombs, the chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: \u201cWhile large month-to-month falls in Halifax\u2019s measure of house prices are common, price growth has fundamentally weakened since the [EU] referendum.\u201d Martin Ellis, Halifax\u2019s housing economist, said house prices were being underpinned by a shortage of properties on the market, low levels of housebuilding and ultra-low interest rates. \u201cThese factors are unlikely to change materially during 2017. Nonetheless, weaker economic growth and increasing pressure on spending power, along with affordability constraints, are expected to dampen housing demand, resulting in some downward pressure on annual house price growth during the year,\u201d he said. Along with other forecasters, Halifax is expecting the economic slowdown to put a brake on the housing market after several years of growth. It has pencilled in price growth of between 1% and 4% this year, and falling prices in London. Nationwide expects a gain of about 2% in 2017, while surveyors\u2019 body Rics has gone for 3%. Financial analyst IHS Global Insight said the Halifax figures pointed to growth of 3% this year \u2013 half the increase reported by Halifax in 2016. \u201cJanuary\u2019s correction in house prices reported by Halifax fuels our belief that house price gains over 2017 will be no more than 3%,\u201d said Howard Archer, the chief UK economist at IHS. \u201cWeakening consumer fundamentals, likely mounting caution over making major spending decisions and elevated house price-to-earnings ratios are likely to weigh down on house prices. However, a shortage of supply is likely to put a hard floor under prices.\u201d Capital Economics expects house price growth to cool to 2% by the end of the year, saying \u201cthe squeeze on household incomes we expect will tend to curb demand\u201d. Tombs has the same prediction. \u201cThe boost to price growth from the Bank of England\u2019s August interest rate cut is starting to wear off and there are signs growth will moderate further over the coming months,\u201d he said. \u201cWith mortgage rates now at a floor and loan-to-income ratios nearing the financial policy committee\u2019s limits, house prices will have to track growth in households\u2019 incomes much more closely this year.\u201d Halifax estimates that the number of first-time buyers rose by 7% last year to 335,750 \u2013 the highest level since the start of the financial crisis in 2007. However, first-time buyer numbers still remain well below the pre-crisis peak of 402,800 in 2006. A total of 1.2m homes changed hands last year, up by 0.4% on 2015.",

      "bodyText": "Aldi has overtaken the Co-op to become the UK\u2019s fifth largest grocer as the discount supermarket stepped up the pace of growth in January. The German retailer increased its market share to 6.2% in the 12 weeks to 29 January compared with 6% for the previous three months, after sales rose 12.4%, well ahead of the market. Fraser McKevitt, the head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar Worldpanel, said: \u201cJust a decade ago Aldi was the UK\u2019s 10th largest food retailer, accounting for less than 2% of the grocery market. Since then the grocer has grown rapidly, climbing the rankings by an impressive five places.\u201d He said that Aldi had attracted 826,000 more shoppers than the same period last year after it opened 70 new stores. Matthew Barnes, the chief executive of Aldi UK and Ireland, said: \u201cAldi customers get products of comparable quality to the leading brands at prices that are significantly cheaper than any of our competitors. This unique offering is resonating with British shoppers and we are opening 70 new stores this year to help keep up with customer demand.\u201d While their pace of growth has slowed in the past two or three years, Aldi and Lidl now control nearly 11% of the UK grocery market after the major players Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s and Asda all lost share. The rise of the discounters, which stock a much smaller range of goods than in most rival stores, has led to price cuts across the sector as the traditional supermarkets try to win back shoppers. Despite being overtaken by Aldi, Co-op sales rose by 2% \u2013 also well ahead of its bigger rivals, continuing a run of growth stretching back to July 2015, helping it maintain a 6% market share. Of the big four supermarkets, only Morrisons gained market share in the period, taking it to 10.9%. The Bradford-based chain increased sales by 1.9% compared with the same period last year, boosting its share of sales for the first time since June 2015. McKevitt said Morrison\u2019s premium own label The Best range proved \u201ca real bright spot\u201d with sales up by 35%. Sainsbury\u2019s sales were flat year on year, while Tesco\u2019s rose 0.3%. Asda continued to lose sales and market share although it slowed the pace of decline to 1.9%, from 2.4% reported at new year. However, the sector has been lifted by the rise in inflation \u2013 from 0.2% to 0.7% in the three months up to 1 January. Even Aldi and Lidl have begun raising the price of basic groceries, including milk and bananas, as the weakening pound increases costs.

      "bodyText": "Websites that let touts resell tickets could be prosecuted unless they have permission from event organisers, under proposals aimed at curbing the secondary ticketing market. Members of the House of Lords have put forward amendments to the digital economy bill that campaigners say would outlaw much of the controversial ticket resale industry, dominated by Viagogo, StubHub, Seatwave and GetMeIn. Among them is a rule that would stop anyone reselling a ticket unless they have been authorised in writing to do so by the event organiser. The measure would deal a major blow to touts who harvest tickets in bulk to resell at vast markups, often despite opposition from artists. The sites also take a cut of the profits from a sale. The offence would carry a maximum fine of \u00a35,000 and this could wipe out the potential profit on resale of a ticket if it is rigidly enforced. Singers Adele and Ed Sheeran and the producers of hit musical Hamilton have taken steps to prevent their tickets being resold at inflated prices but have seen touts circumvent their efforts with relative ease. Proposed amendments to the digital economy bill also include other measures aimed at some of the more controversial methods employed by ticket touts. They include prison terms of up to a year for the use of bot software to harvest tickets \u2013 a measure proposed by Conservative MP Nigel Adams \u2013 and a provision allowing promoters to take legal action against touts. This would allow for court action to remove tickets advertised for sale if the seller does not provide sufficient information about the ticket, while touts could also be forced to hand over any profit. Another amendment would see internet service providers fined if they do not withdraw internet access from touts who breach consumer laws. Touts would also face more stringent requirements to publish their name and company details, under proposals to strengthen the Consumer Rights Act. The Competition and Markets Authority is already looking into whether touts are complying with existing provisions of the act, such as the requirement to publish the seat location and its face value. The proposals, to be debated in the House of Lords this week, follow a string of revelations about the grip on tickets for in-demand events wielded by the UK\u2019s most powerful touts. The amendment banning unauthorised ticket resale was tabled by Liberal Democrat peers Lord Clement-Jones and Lord Foster of Bath and is likely to be refined as the bill goes through parliament. Security consultant and ticketing expert Reg Walker said it could restore the power over ticket distribution to the music and sports industries. \u201cIt will go a long way to curbing the activities of the secondary ticket market which prevents fans from buying tickets at face value, artificially inflates prices, and makes music and sporting events unaffordable to a whole strata of society,\u201d Walker said. \u201cIt will outlaw a large part of the secondary market that currently works to the detriment of consumers.\u201d But he warned that the law would have to cover overseas firms, given that Viagogo is registered in Switzerland and StubHub, owned by eBay, is registered in Luxembourg. Labour MP Sharon Hodgson said: \u201cThere is far more the government can be doing to support genuine fans and stop touts, and I hope the government responds constructively when debating these amendments.\u201d A spokesperson for anti-tout campaign group FanFair Alliance said: \u201cThis is a broken market, and UK audiences are the ones paying the price,\u201d adding that \u201cthe status quo has become untenable\u201d. The group said the music industry needed \u201ca suite of measures to tackle this scourge above and beyond action to stop the misuse of bots to bulk buy and harvest tickets\u201d. But it warned of unintended consequences if firms were banned from unauthorised resale even at face value or below. Some ticket firms are understood to be concerned that Ticketmaster could corner the market for authorised resale, thanks to the power wielded by its parent company LiveNation, the world\u2019s largest live entertainment firm.",

      "bodyText": "The UK could shake off the near-term impact of Brexit to become the fastest-growing economy in the G7 group of rich countries between now and 2050, according to a report that paints a bright outlook for the country\u2019s prospects outside the EU. Consultants PwC say the UK economy will not escape entirely unscathed from the decision to leave the bloc and that it will dampen growth prospects in the short term. But the brunt of the impact would be felt by 2020 and in the years that follow the UK would outperform its peers thanks to its relatively large working age population and its flexible economy. PwC sets out the UK\u2019s prospects in its latest report into how the world economy will look in 2050. Using models that analyse population trends, investment, education and technological progress, PwC economists expect six of the seven largest economies by 2050 will be emerging markets, led by China. They see the UK economy remaining in the top 10, slipping down one spot from ninth place now to 10th in purchasing power parity (PPP) terms, which adjusts for price differences between countries to provide a measure of the volume of goods and services produced by an economy. France is forecast to drop out of the top 10, to 12th place in 2050, while Germany is forecast to fall from fifth place to ninth. Mexico is the only newcomer to the top 10 in 2050. PwC says the UK\u2019s performance will depend on it setting up strong trading arrangements and remaining open to \u201ctalented workers\u201d from around the world. \u201cOur relatively positive long-term growth projection for the UK is due to favourable demographic factors and a relatively flexible economy by European standards,\u201d said John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC. \u201cHowever, developing successful trade and investment links with faster-growing emerging economies will be critical to achieving this, offsetting probable weaker trade links with the EU after Brexit.\u201d With annual average growth of about 1.9% over the period to 2050, the UK is projected to be the fastest-growing economy of the G7, which comprises it, the US, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan. PwC\u2019s projections see the world economy doubling in size by 2042, growing at an average annual rate of 2.5% to 2050. But it adds a note of caution that the forecasts are based on some basic assumptions. \u201cWe assume broadly growth-friendly (but not perfect) policies and no major civilisation-threatening global catastrophes (eg nuclear war, asteroid collisions) over the period to 2050,\u201d the report said. In PPP terms, China is already the world\u2019s largest economy and will continue to be so in 2050, by a significant margin, the report said. Emphasising the role of emerging economies in driving growth and taking an increasing share of the global economy, the report also predicted India could have edged past the US into second place by then, with Indonesia rising to fourth place. But the picture is very different when economies are ranked by GDP per person, which is seen as a better gauge of how growth is translating into changes in living standards. By that measure, the US is still the world\u2019s leading economy in 2050 followed by Germany, the UK and Canada. But China and India are closing the income gap with those at the top, according to PwC\u2019s projections. \u201cIn 2016, US GDP per capita was almost four times the size of China\u2019s and almost nine times the size of India\u2019s. By 2050, these gaps are projected to close to around double China\u2019s and around three times India\u2019s, demonstrating long-term income convergence,\u201d the report said. The consultancy firm\u2019s long-term optimism about the UK economy is in contrast to its more gloomy near-term forecasts for the effects of a Brexit vote, published with pro-remain business group the CBI before the referendum. Its analysis in March last year warned that leaving the EU would cause a serious shock to the UK economy that could lead to 950,000 job losses and leave the average household \u00a33,700 worse off by 2020. Since the referendum, most economic outlooks have been shown to be overly pessimistic and forecasters, including the Bank of England, have been forced to revise up their predictions for UK growth. Hawksworth conceded that after unexpected events in 2016, it may appear odd to make predictions for as far out as 2050. But he said there was an important role for such long-range forecasting. \u201cAfter a year of major political shocks with the Brexit vote and the election of President Trump, it might seem brave to opine on economic prospects for 2017, let alone 2050,\u201d he said. \u201cBut a long-term view is crucial for considering areas like pensions, healthcare, energy and climate change, housing, transport and other infrastructure investment. By looking beyond unpredictable short-term economic and political cycles and focusing on fundamentals, long-term growth projections can actually be more reliable than short-term forecasts.\u201d",
