      "bodyText": "\u201cAny company that gives stuff away is not a company, it is a charity,\u201d grumbled Vittorio Colao, the chief executive of Vodafone, last November when a competitor in India started offering free mobile phone services, thereby putting a \u20ac6.3bn (\u00a35.4bn) dent in the value of the provider\u2019s local business. Vodafone shareholders, who hadn\u2019t been terribly enthusiastic about India for a while, braced themselves for further instalments in a tale of disappointed dreams. But here comes the fightback \u2013 or, rather, a defensive deal designed to ensure Vodafone can stay the course in India. Vodafone, No 2 in the market, has opened negotiations to merge its operations with those of the third-largest operator, Idea Cellular. The combined business would be the market leader in India with an astonishing 380 million customers. Is that sufficient protection against the aggressive pricing tactics of Reliance Jio, owned by the billionaire Mukesh Ambani? It ought to be \u2013 eventually. Jio is very definitely a company but Colao was correct that even wealthy tycoons do not authorise $25bn of investment unless they intend to make a commercial return. Jio has acquired 70 million customers via its cut-price and free deals; the moment at which it tries to make some money from them can\u2019t be delayed indefinitely. In theory, then, a Vodafone-Idea operation ought to be well positioned when the dust settles. But, before Vodafone shareholders rediscover their taste for India, they will want to see the terms of any deal with Idea. The Indian company\u2019s announcement said the two partners would have equal rights in the merged entity. But Vodafone is the larger player. If equality is to be achieved via an equalisation payment, it needs to be transparent and fair. If not, Colao, in his search for safety, could himself be accused of being too charitable. But, if he can clear that hurdle, Colao would be entitled to encourage his shareholders to be more cheerful about India. The market is huge and all the mobile operators benefit from an underpowered fixed-line network. Owning a half-share in the No 1 player is not a bad place to be if you\u2019re prepared to take a long-term view. CMA will make a meal of Tesco\u2019s Booker deal On the second trading day, investors finally understood that Tesco\u2019s plan to buy Booker for \u00a33.7bn won\u2019t be a picnic. The inevitable competition inquiry could be long and its outcome is anybody\u2019s guess. Both companies\u2019 share prices fell \u2013 Tesco\u2019s by 4%, reversing half of Friday\u2019s gain. Clive Black, an analyst at Shore Capital, has coined the term \u201cpostcode analysis constipation\u201d to describe an ailment that could afflict the Competition and Markets Authority in the months ahead. The regulator has been a regular sufferer in the past with its phenomenally detailed on-the-ground studies of competition implications. With Tesco and Booker, the postcode pain threatens to be excruciating. The big idea in the takeover is that thousands of independent Premier, Londis and Budgens convenience stores \u2013 currently supplied by Booker \u2013 will be serviced in future by the company that owns thousands of competing Tesco Metros, Expresses and One-Stop convenience outlets plus the UK\u2019s biggest traditional supermarket business. That arrangement would definitely be unusual. Would it also be anti-competitive? Supplying competing outlets is not the same as owning them; all those independent Premier, Londis and Budgens shopkeepers would still be free to take their business elsewhere. But it is inevitable that some Tesco-heavy postcodes will become more so if one counts the to-be-supplied convenience stores. But, if that\u2019s deemed to be against consumers\u2019 interests, how to unpick the worst examples of local dominance? What if all those Booker independent shopkeepers accept chief executive Charles Wilson\u2019s line that Tesco can sell them better quality fruit\u2019n\u2019veg at better prices? Would it be fair to declare that only some of the shopkeepers can join the party? There is a long way to go before such decisions become relevant. But already one can understand why Richard Cousins, the dissenting director on Tesco\u2019s board, quit. Cousins thought Tesco needed to simplify its business, not make it more complicated by buying Booker. He had wider factors in mind than just the competition inquiry. But, once the CMA gets stuck in, complication is the way to bet. Ex-FCA chief\u2019s Standard Chartered role is no big deal Tracey McDermott, formerly the enforcement chief and then acting head of the Financial Conduct Authority, is to join Standard Chartered, one of the banks she used to help regulate. She\u2019s done the appropriate spell of gardening leave, the FSA has imposed rules of engagement on Standard Chartered and McDermott is entitled to seek new employment. All the same, many will be dispirited to see the revolving door between regulators and banks take another spin. But we should probably get over such squeamishness. If it is OK for the former chancellor George Osborne to earn \u00a3200,000 a year advising the fund manager BlackRock while remaining an MP, McDermott\u2019s move barely merits a footnote.",

    "webTitle": "Stock markets hit by US travel ban fears, Dow falls below 20,000 - as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The uncertainty and chaos caused by Donald Trump\u2019s travel ban has sent stock markets tumbling. With a number of Asian markets falling overnight - the Nikkei lost 0.5% - Europe and the US soon followed suit. In the UK, the FTSE 100 lost all the gains made so far this year, closing at its lowest level since 28 December. Things would have been worse without a boost from Vodafone after the mobile phone group said it was in talks about merging its Indian business with Idea Cellular. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: The market narrative has shifted once again. For the past three months a Trump presidency has been heralded as great for stocks. Now, with Dow 20,000 behind us, it seems his government can be blamed for the bout of selling that has engulfed markets. The truth, as ever, probably lies somewhere in between these two extremes but there is probably some truth in the idea that geopolitical jitters are playing a part in price action today. The FTSE 100 has now surrendered all its gains for the year...Markets overall have been ripe for a correction for some time now, and were merely in need of a reason to begin; Trump\u2019s rambunctious opening to his presidency, and the lighter volumes caused by holidays in Asian markets, may well have provided the bears with the opening they needed. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 0.92% or 66.01 points at 7118.48 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 1.12% to 11,681.89 France\u2019s Cac closed down 1.14% at 4784.64 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 2.95% to 18,759.40 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 1.5% lower at 9361.3 In Greece, the Athens market lost 3.53% to 614.08 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 183 points or 0.92% at 19,910. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Italy\u2019s biggest bank has said its capital ratios at the end of 2016 would not meet requirements set down by the European Central Bank. The bank is launching a \u20ac13bn rights issue to help bolster its finances, which should put it back on track to meet the ECB levels. It said: [We envisage] a temporary deficit versus the corresponding applicable capital requirement as at 31 December 2016 .... by approximately 2% which is expected to be fully restored upon completion of the rights issue, which, subject to regulatory approvals, is expected to be settled before March 10th, 2017 on the basis of the current timetable. The bank also said it expected to make an \u20ac11.8bn loss for 2016, with further negative one-off items: Group financial results are impacted by a number of negative non-recurring items of which approximately \u20ac12.2bn were disclosed at UniCredit\u2019s Capital Markets Day, on December 13th, 2016, in the context of the presentation of the 2016-2019 Strategic Plan.. The Group has taken into account a number of additional negative one-off items amounting to approximately \u20ac1.0bn, which are expected to be recorded in 2016. Such one-off items primarily result from a higher write-down of the investment in the Atlante Funds, on some participations and Deferred Tax Assets for temporary differences and extraordinary contributions to the National Resolution Fund. As a result, the 2016 Group\u2019s estimated net financial result is expected to record a loss of approximately \u20ac11.8bn. Unicredit\u2019s shares fell 5.45% on the news, helping drag the Stoxx 600 Banking Index down 1.68%. Despite the slump in markets following Trump\u2019s travel ban, most are still within reach of record highs. But Larry Summers, former US Treasury Secretary, has told Bloomberg TV he is concerned about the recent rises in markets: What I think is a clear error, is to confuse several months of strong markets, with strong fundamentals. The period post-election when markets did best in the twentieth century was the period between Herbert Hoover\u2019s election and his inauguration. And of course, as a presidency, that was the biggest economic disaster that we had. So I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen next in markets, but nobody should be serene just because markets are behaving well. On the Trump ban he said he was not surprised that the technology sector has spoken out against it: As global businesses, they have a huge stake in the United States being a nation of the Statue of Liberty rather than being a nation of refugee camps and barbed wire. They have a huge stake in the United States supporting an open and tolerant global system, they have that stake for their employees, they have it for their customers, they have it for the reputation of the United States and they have spoken out. And on chief executives being threatened by the prospect of Trump tweeting against their companies, he said: I\u2019m sure most of them share the values of inclusion, the values of American tradition that were reflected in the statements that John McCain and Lindsey Graham made, the statements that Jeff Immelt made. And I don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s a sadder thing if others don\u2019t have those values or whether it\u2019s a sadder thing if they are being intimidated by the prospect of a tweet. But it\u2019s an extraordinary thing if business leaders in the United States are being intimidated by a president\u2019s threats of calling them out when the president\u2019s been in office for one week. That is an extraordinary change in what the United States is about. Back with the markets, and the Dow\u2019s fall back below 20,000, Spreadex financial analyst Connor Campbell said: In what is a fairly significant development the Dow Jones opened under 20000 this Monday, causing the Trump travel ban losses to increase across the board. The Dow plunged by 150 points after the bell, US investors equally unhappy with the instability brought on by Trump\u2019s actions as their European cousins. Now, the fact that a potentially March rate-hike signalling Fed meeting looms on Wednesday, alongside the first Trump-era non-farm jobs report on Friday, may have something to do with the Dow\u2019s losses. However, there is no doubt that the main catalyst for the drop has been the Muslim travel ban executive order from the President, not for moral reasons that have caused outrage elsewhere but instead the potential ramifications it could have for trade from the Middle East and elsewhere. With the Dow dipping below its landmark 20000 level there was no reason for the European indices to change tack this afternoon. The FTSE maintained a 0.8% decline as the day went on, keeping the UK index at a 2017 low despite the pound\u2019s own slide against the dollar and euro. The DAX and CAC, meanwhile, gradually saw their losses intensify after the US open; the German and French indices are now both down 1.1%. Still with housing, but moving to Ireland, and credit ratings agency Moody\u2019s predicts that Irish house prices could rise by 5% this year. Henry McDonald adds: The number of homeowners in the Republic who are trapped in negative equity or have fallen behind in their mortgage repayments has also dropped dramatically, Moody\u2019s say. In their new year analysis of the Irish housing market, which was one of the main factors contributing to Ireland\u2019s economic collapse towards national bankruptcy in the recession, the Moody\u2019s report found that negative equity in the Republic is \u201cstill high.\u201d However, Moody\u2019s have found that the number of borrowers in arrears or negative equity has fallen from its peak in 2013 to one third of all homeowners. In the aftermath of the financial crash, almost two-thirds of Irish homeowners were exposed to mortgage arrears or negative equity. Its report also forecasts a supply shortage in new or available homes which will fuel rising house prices in the state. Overall Moody\u2019s projects that rising house prices and few mortgage arrears will continue to spread to Irish banks and their bonds which are backed up by home loans According to the Irish Mortgage Holders Organisation there are 35,000 home owners in the Republic who have been in mortgage arrears for over two years. Signs of strength in the US housing market. Pending home sales rebounded in December after a decline the previous month, with the National Association of Realtors\u2019 index rising by 1.6% to 109. Analysts had been expecting a 1% increase. Lawrence Yun, the association\u2019s chief economist, said: Pending sales rebounded last month as enough buyers fended off rising mortgage rates and alarmingly low inventory levels1 to sign a contract. The main storyline in the early months of 2017 will be if supply can meaningfully increase to keep price growth at a moderate enough level for households to absorb higher borrowing costs. Sales will struggle to build on last year\u2019s strong pace if inventory conditions don\u2019t improve. The news has done little for the market, where investors are more worried about the uncertainty caused by Donald Trump\u2019s travel ban. Unsurprisingly given the chaos and uncertainty caused by Donald Trump\u2019s travel ban and the falls it has caused in Asian and European markets, Wall Street has opened sharply lower. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has dropped 0.66% or 130 points to 19,963 - below the 20,000 barrier it struggled for so long to achieve. The S&amp;P 500 opened 0.41% lower and the Nasdaq Composite 0.46%. Losses were not confined to one particular sector but spread across the board. In the UK market, one of the day\u2019s big risers is engineering and consultancy group WS Atkins. Its shares have jumped more than 7% following a report in the Times (\u00a3) that US peer CH2M had approached the group about a possible merger. Atkins - which has partnered the US group on projects - is not commenting, but analysts at Liberum said the idea was credible: A response from Atkins in relation to the rumoured merger with CH2M is possible in the next day. A merger would almost double the size of the current business and would have more than 50% sales to the US. The business would be particularly strong in Energy, Water and Transportation. We believe that speculation is credible given the industry trend towards consolidation and would potentially create a top 5 global design company. Although the history of M&amp;A is chequered in the sector, we see the potential combination as an early cycle play on growth in US infrastructure. CH2M\u2019s third quarter trading update indicated lower earnings year on year. CH2M has had a challenging time but the suggested valuation of $2bn appears to be a reasonable market cap. The enterprise value is significantly higher, given debt, preference shares, pensions, and perhaps joint venture liabilities. The pension will be a key factor although liabilities have reduced post a controversial deal with the PPF. Premature to assess value creation, but expect limited cost-savings and an interesting debate on revenue synergies. Atkins has already said it is hoping to benefit from Donald Trump\u2019s proposed infrastructure spending plans. Back with the German inflation figures, and despite consumer prices increasing by 1.9% year on year in January, that does not mean the ECB should rein in its stimulus programme, says economist Dr Andreas Rees at UniCredit: Four weeks ago when the December figure was released, there was an outcry by some media and politicians about rising inflation risks in Germany. The ECB should act by unwinding QE as quickly as possible before it is too late, so the story went. It is likely that you will read such statements once again even the latest headline inflation figure came in a tad below expectations. In our view, this kind of thinking is not based on economic facts for two reasons. First, there are no signs of a persistent upward trend in consumer prices. Instead, it is largely about oil. Second, German private households\u2019 inflation expectations remained well anchored. Let us state the obvious: Rising inflation at the turn of the year has primarily been caused by energy prices, or more precisely by the higher oil price. The latest driver was the agreement between OPEC and non-OPEC countries such as Russia at the end of November to curb output. It was the first agreement of a global oil cartel since 2001. According to our calculations based on federal states data, inflation excluding food and energy was up a more moderate 1.4% year on year after 1.5% in the previous month.... More important, the latest inflation excitement in the media and by some policymakers has been crying wolf as flagged by forward-looking surveys. Private households do not anticipate any surging inflation which goes beyond the energy rise. As a matter of fact, inflation expectations of Germans for the next 12 months hit its trough in spring of last year and rose since then, pretty much in line with what one would expect in the light of the oil price increase. The latest inflation expectations survey for January (conducted by the EU Commission) shows that they still remained below its long-term average. In other words, the allegedly so inflation averse Germans have noticed higher fuel price at the gas stations but they are not really concerned for good reason. Going forward, we expect further rising inflation rates in a range of 2\u00bc%-2\u00bd% year on year for the next three months or so before a stabilisation is kicking in. It will be all about the oil price ... whose effects (on a year on year basis) will be fizzling out in the further course of 2017. On average, we expect +1.8% in consumer prices this year after +0.5% in 2016. There\u2019s no sign of a recovery in the European stock markets: FXTM\u2019s vice president of market research, Jameel Ahmad, says the turmoil caused by the Trump administration in the last few days is to blame. Whether it is building a wall, banning certain nationalities, starting a trade war or pretty much anything else President Trump may do to upset people, it does risk both creating and deepening a negative perception of the US. What if someone now reacts by banning US products, or even worse US nationals from entering their nations? What if investors now decide to take money out of US funds? Over one million Britons have already reacted by signing a petition to stop an upcoming visit from Trump to the United Kingdom, something that will put even more pressure on Theresa May as she has not only just concluded a meeting with the new President but is already under pressure to meet her own deadline to invoke Article 50 within the next two months. Although it is expected and understood that the UK will be aiming to strengthen relationships around the world following the result of the EU Referendum, I am unsure how people will react to Theresa May strengthening a relationship with the United States that appears on track to isolate itself from globalisation. Fresh US consumer spending figures show that the American public kept spending last month. Consumer spending rose by 0.5% in December, up from +0.2% in November, suggesting the economy ended 2016 in solid shape. The report also shows inflation picking up; the Personal Consumption Expenditure index (a measure of the cost of living), jumped to 1.6%, or 1.7% if volatile factors like food and energy are excluded. The jump in German inflation to 1.9% this month will intensify the pressure on the European Central Bank to rein in its stimulus programme. The ECB is currently keeping interest rates at 0%, charging banks which leave money with them, and buying \u20ac80bn of government and corporate debt each month with newly created money. With German inflation on the brink of 2%, Berlin will argue that the ECB needs to tighten policy now - even though prices are rising more modestly in other countries. Carsten Brzeski, chief economist at ING, says Germany\u2019s \u2018bogeyman\u2019 has returned. But we\u2019re not back in the 1920s yet..... As Brzeski puts it The common German reflex to criticize the ECB and call for an end of QE is, in our view, overblown. First of all, there is very little the ECB can do about an increase in inflation, almost exclusively driven by energy and food prices. Secondly, even in an economy operating at full employment and which is most advanced in the current cycle, underlying inflationary pressure remains low... Thirdly, even if German inflation was to exceed 2% sustainably, it is simply a mathematical prerequisite for the inflation in the entire Eurozone to also get close to 2%. Newsflash: Inflation in Germany has hit its highest level since July 2013, in the latest sign that the cost of living is picking up in Europe. Germany\u2019s Consumer Prices Index jumped to 1.9% in January, according to flash estimates, up from 1.7% in December. Some economists had expected it to hit 2% - just over the official target for inflation across the eurozone. There are also signs today that the eurozone debt crisis is bubbling up. The yield, or interest rate, on Greek two-year bonds has jumped from 6.8% to 8.6% today. That means investors are keen to offload the debt, following the IMF\u2019s warning that Greece needs substantial debt relief. Shares in several travel companies have fallen today. Air France-KLM are down 2.2%, IAG (parent company of British Airways) have lost 1.2% and InterContinental Hotels are 1.6% lower. They would all suffer if the global economy slows, or enters an era of greater protectionism. Insurance group AXA UK has pledged to will honour claims from customers affected by Trump\u2019s travel clampdown - even though they\u2019re not technically covered for such disruption. Here\u2019s the official statement: \u201cIn light of the sudden and unexpected decision by the Trump administration to block entry to the US for nationals from Syria, Somalia, Sudan, Iraq, Iran, Libya and Yemen, AXA Insurance UK confirms that individuals who have been denied entry as a result of the executive order, will be able to claim on their policy. Although not technically covered, we view the current situation as unprecedented and unforeseen and as such we are extending the cover under our policies. For those intending to travel to, or return from, the United States of America we recommend allowing extra time due to protests currently taking place at a number of airports.\u201d European stock markets remain in the red as lunchtime approaches, with the German, French and UK indices all down around 0.8%. CMC Markets\u2019 Michael Hewson says the US president\u2019s ban visitors from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen is causing alarm. Global Indices have started on the back foot this morning, after US President Trump announced one of his most radical policies yet, in the form of a travel ban. The resulting press criticism and mass protests appear to have pushed some investors to the sidelines as rising uncertainty in the ability of the President not to cause damage to the US economy starts to increase, and uncertainty rarely bodes well for financial markets. Bloomberg has flagged up that the tech industry has particular reasons to worry about Trump: A glimmer of good news; economic confidence across the euro area has hit its highest level in almost six years. The EC\u2019s Economic Sentiment Indicator, which tracks business and consumer confidence, has jumped to 108.2 from 107.8 in December, the best reading since March 2011. But with Trump causing anxiety worldwide, and crunch elections in Germany and France this year, can confidence hold up? Only a handful of the 100 companies on the blue-chip Footsie index have risen this morning; the rest have been dragged down by concerns over Trump\u2019s policies. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, says the FTSE 100 is \u2018floundering\u2019 this morning, as it sheds 60 points to its lowest level of 2017. Friday\u2019s dour finish across US markets seems to have paved the way for this morning\u2019s weak trade, with markets turning their focus away from Donald Trump\u2019s business friendly measures and towards his more controversial decision to ban citizens and refugees from seven states in the Middle East and Africa. As we enter February, we are due the typical raft of economic data, with the Bank of England\u2019s \u2018Super Thursday\u2019 and Friday\u2019s US jobs report meaning that volatility is expected to grow as the week progresses. UK public anger about Trump\u2019s actions continues to build; one million people have now signed the petition opposing him receiving a state visit. The US stock market is expected to dip when trading begins in five hours time. The futures market indicates the Dow Jones industrial average will shed 40-ish points to around 20053, having hit record highs last week. Remo Fritschi, institutional Sales Manager at ADS Securities in London, believes Trump\u2019s refugee clampdown could spur a burst of profit-taking on Wall Street. Wall Street is looking at a softer start to the week as questions begin to mount over just how damaging the new US immigration policy will be to a number of multinational businesses. Sweeping bans on admission to the country from a number of nations risks undermining the globalisation agenda that has helped pump valuations in a range of US-listed stocks over the last few years, whilst the prospect of similar restrictions being applied to US citizens could also hamper overseas trade initiatives. Back in the eurozone, Spain\u2019s economy has posted another quarter of solid growth. Spanish GDP expanded by 0.7% in October-December, matching the growth rate in the previous three months. It means Spain grew by 3.2% in 2016, the third year of growth since its recession during the euro debt crisis. Reminder, we get more eurozone GDP data on Tuesday. Paul Donovan, economist at UBS, has warned clients that investors in the Middle East could pull money out of America, if they feel Trump is persecuting Muslims. European stock markets are all in retreat this morning, as the US travel ban hits sentiment across the continent. The share price rally sparked by Trump\u2019s shock election win in November has now fizzled out; the FTSE 100 is now in the red for 2017. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says: Pretty much everything slipped into the red this morning, the markets reacting to the fresh bout of instability brought on by Donald Trump over the weekend. Though the Trump rally may have lifted the markets to their current peaks, the global outrage that has greeted the President\u2019s first week in office, the most recent instance being the well-placed disgust at his Muslim travel ban, is now beginning suppress investors\u2019 appetites especially since, as mentioned, the indices are trading so high. Naeem Aslam, analyst at Think Markets, says Trump is creating \u201cmore uncertainty and jitters among investors.\u201d The major US tech giants have also strongly condemned the president\u2019s executive order which is not helping business confidence. Starbucks, the US coffee giant, announced today that they will hire 10,000 refuges over the next 5 years, sending a clear message to Trump\u2019s anti-immigrant and biased policies. You could certainly say that the tourism sector over in the US might also feel the pinch as holidaying stateside is not an ideal scenario for visitors in light of his new anti-immigration policies. After a blizzard of executive orders on immigration, border control, oil pipelines and trade, it\u2019s becoming clear that Trump actually means what he said during last year\u2019s campaign. This may be an unwelcome shock to investors who hoped the billionaire would take a different path once in office. James Woods, global investment analyst at Rivkin Securities in Sydney, explains (via Reuters): \u201cTrump always stated these were policies he would implement. \u201cQuite a lot of it was brushed off as \u2018campaign rhetoric\u2019 but he is following through. \u201cThis renews concerns about a trade war with China that would significantly affect both Asian and the global economy.\u201d Stock markets and the US dollar are both starting the week on the back foot, as Donald Trump\u2019s controversial travel ban worries investors. Shares have fallen in Asia, amid fears that Trump\u2019s policies will hurt the US economy, and trigger a new phase of protectionism. Japan\u2019s Nikkei fell 0.5%, while Australia\u2019s S&amp;P/ASX index shed almost 1%. European stock markets are under pressure too, with London\u2019s FTSE 100 dropping by 55 points, or 0.75%, to 7129 in early trading. The US dollar also retreated against the Japanese yen, dropping by 0.2% to \u00a5114.88. The selloff comes after Trump imposed a 90-day ban on citizens from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia or Yemen travelling to the US, and temporarily halted America\u2019s refugee programme. The move has sparked heavy criticism around the globe, and protests in several American cities. In Britain, a petition against Trump being granted a state visit to Britain has already attracted almost one million signatures. Financial analysts are concerned that the backlash against Trump\u2019s plans could have serious economic consequences. Stephen Innes, a senior trader at OANDA, summed the situation up well: \u201cWorld leaders were quick to condemn President Trump\u2019s executive order to ban U.S. travel from seven Muslim countries. The global reaction has been one of universal condemnation. The fear here is that the market may start to think that personal vendetta is clouding the Oval Office judgment and they could express a huge vote of non-confidence through the markets. \u201cThe increase in civil unrest alone should be a concern for investors, and with a lack of clarity on the economic policy front, markets will be cantankerous early in the week as they\u2019re completely uncertain of what\u2019s next from President Trump on the geopolitical landscape.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. This is going to be a big week for news, with European growth data being released, two key central bank meetings, and a new healthcheck on America\u2019s jobs market. On Tuesday, we get new eurozone GDP figures showing how the currency bloc fared in the last three months of 2016, plus euro inflation data for January. Wednesday brings a Federal Reserve meeting; the US central bank isn\u2019t expected to raise interest rates, but could hint at a hike in March. Here\u2019s Bloomberg\u2019s take: On Thursday the Bank of England will announce its interest rate decision, and publish its quarterly inflation report. With inflation picking up, the BoE could face pressure to raise rates sooner than expected. Finally, Friday will bring the latest US jobs data, in the Non-Farm Payroll report. That will show if America\u2019s labour market is slowing down, after years of solid growth under Barack Obama. Coming up today.... The week starts with new inflation figures from Germany, at 1pm GMT, and America at 1.30pm GMT. Economists predict that Germany\u2019s inflation rate may have risen to 2% in January, slightly over the eurozone\u2019s target, and ahead of other European countries. German politicians are already anxious that the European Central Bank is too relaxed about the rising cost of living, so today\u2019s data could fuel that debate. Analysts at RBC Capital Markets say: The consensus call is that the German inflation rate rose to 2% y/y in January, in line with the ECB\u2019s own target with the likelihood that the rate will rise further in coming months which will likely see further public calls from Germany policy makers and commentators for the ECB to begin to consider normalising policy. We\u2019ll also have an eye on Greece, as talks with its creditors drag on. Experts fear trouble ahead unless the latest phase of Athens\u2019 bailout is signed off by 20 February. We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day....",

In the UK, the FTSE 100 lost all the gains made so far this year, closing at its lowest level since 28 December. Things would have been worse without a boost from Vodafone after the mobile phone group said it was in talks about merging its Indian business with Idea Cellular. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The market narrative has shifted once again. For the past three months a Trump presidency has been heralded as great for stocks. Now, with Dow 20,000 behind us, it seems his government can be blamed for the bout of selling that has engulfed markets. The truth, as ever, probably lies somewhere in between these two extremes but there is probably some truth in the idea that geopolitical jitters are playing a part in price action today. The FTSE 100 has now surrendered all its gains for the year...Markets overall have been ripe for a correction for some time now, and were merely in need of a reason to begin; Trump\u2019s rambunctious opening to his presidency, and the lighter volumes caused by holidays in Asian markets, may well have provided the bears with the opening they needed.</p> </blockquote> <p>The final scores in Europe showed:</p> <ul> <li><strong>The FTSE 100 finished down 0.92% or 66.01 points at 7118.48</strong></li> <li><strong>Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 1.12% to 11,681.89</strong></li> <li><strong>France\u2019s Cac closed down 1.14% at 4784.64</strong></li> <li><strong>Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 2.95% to 18,759.40</strong></li> <li><strong>Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 1.5% lower at 9361.3</strong></li> <li><strong>In Greece, the Athens market lost 3.53% to 614.08</strong></li> </ul> <p>On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 183 points or 0.92% at 19,910.</p> <p><em>On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening.

They have a huge stake in the United States supporting an open and tolerant global system, they have that stake for their employees, they have it for their customers, they have it for the reputation of the United States and they have spoken out.</p> </blockquote> <p>And on chief executives being threatened by the prospect of Trump tweeting against their companies, he said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I\u2019m sure most of them share the values of inclusion, the values of American tradition that were reflected in the statements that John McCain and Lindsey Graham made, the statements that Jeff Immelt made.</p> <p>And I don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s a sadder thing if others don\u2019t have those values or whether it\u2019s a sadder thing if they are being intimidated by the prospect of a tweet. But it\u2019s an extraordinary thing if business leaders in the United States are being intimidated by a president\u2019s threats of calling them out when the president\u2019s been in office for one week.

A merger would almost double the size of the current business and would have more than 50% sales to the US. The business would be particularly strong in Energy, Water and Transportation. We believe that speculation is credible given the industry trend towards consolidation and would potentially create a top 5 global design company. Although the history of M&amp;A is chequered in the sector, we see the potential combination as an early cycle play on growth in US infrastructure. CH2M\u2019s third quarter trading update indicated lower earnings year on year. CH2M has had a challenging time but the suggested valuation of $2bn appears to be a reasonable market cap. The enterprise value is significantly higher, given debt, preference shares, pensions, and perhaps joint venture liabilities. The pension will be a key factor although liabilities have reduced post a controversial deal with the PPF. Premature to assess value creation, but expect limited cost-savings and an interesting debate on revenue synergies.</p> </blockquote> <p>Atkins has already said it is hoping to benefit from Donald Trump\u2019s proposed infrastructure spending plans.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-01-30T14:21:48.493Z\">at 2.21pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-588f4814e4b0f1550c0da66f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-01-30T14:10:47.838Z\">2.10pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Back with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2017/jan/30/stock-markets-us-dollar-trump-travel-ban-german-inflation-business-live?page=with:block-588f391de4b0860ce556a712#block-588f391de4b0860ce556a712\">the German inflation figures</a>, and despite consumer prices increasing by 1.9% year on year in January, that does not mean the ECB should rein in its stimulus programme, says economist Dr Andreas Rees at UniCredit:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Four weeks ago when the December figure was released, there was an outcry by some media and politicians about rising inflation risks in Germany. The ECB should act by unwinding QE as quickly as possible before it is too late, so the story went. It is likely that you will read such statements once again even the latest headline inflation figure came in a tad below expectations. In our view, this kind of thinking is not based on economic facts for two reasons. First, there are no signs of a persistent upward trend in consumer prices. Instead, it is largely about oil. Second, German private households\u2019 inflation expectations remained well anchored.</p> <p>Let us state the obvious: Rising inflation at the turn of the year has primarily been caused by energy prices, or more precisely by the higher oil price. The latest driver was the agreement between OPEC and non-OPEC countries such as Russia at the end of November to curb output. It was the first agreement of a global oil cartel since 2001. According to our calculations based on federal states data, inflation excluding food and energy was up a more moderate 1.4% year on year after 1.5% in the previous month....</p> <p>More important, the latest inflation excitement in the media and by some policymakers has been crying wolf as flagged by forward-looking surveys. Private households do not anticipate any surging inflation which goes beyond the energy rise. As a matter of fact, inflation expectations of Germans for the next 12 months hit its trough in spring of last year and rose since then, pretty much in line with what one would expect in the light of the oil price increase. The latest inflation expectations survey for January (conducted by the EU Commission) shows that they still remained below its long-term average. In other words, the allegedly so inflation averse Germans have noticed higher fuel price at the gas stations but they are not really concerned for good reason. </p> <p>Going forward, we expect further rising inflation rates in a range of 2\u00bc%-2\u00bd% year on year for the next three months or so before a stabilisation is kicking in. It will be all about the oil price ... whose effects (on a year on year basis) will be fizzling out in the further course of 2017. On average, we expect +1.8% in consumer prices this year after +0.5% in 2016. </p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-01-30T14:11:19.131Z\">at 2.11pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-588f4623e4b0860ce556a75f\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-01-30T14:00:00.414Z\">2.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Trump turmoil keeps markets in the red</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>There\u2019s no sign of a recovery in the European stock markets:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6993869687bc04daeac7c347e4b4c24679964b67\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6993869687bc04daeac7c347e4b4c24679964b67/0_0_741_413/500.jpg\" alt=\"European markets, 1.45pm GMT\" width=\"500\" height=\"279\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>FXTM\u2019s</strong> vice president of market research, <strong>Jameel Ahmad,</strong> says the turmoil caused by the Trump administration in the last few days is to blame<strong>.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Whether it is building a wall, banning certain nationalities, starting a trade war or pretty much anything else President Trump may do to upset people, it does risk both creating and deepening a negative perception of the US.</p> <p>What if someone now reacts by banning US products, or even worse US nationals from entering their nations?

      "bodyText": "A group of six financiers including a former senior HBOS banker face jail after being convicted on Monday for their roles in a scam involving \u00a3245m worth of fraudulent loans. Ex-HBOS manager Lynden Scourfield, 54, was bribed by David Mills, 60, with foreign cruises and sex parties, a jury at Southwark crown court found on Monday. In addition the former banker was lavished with stays in Mayfair hotels, trips to Las Vegas and Barbados, a \u00a33,220 Cartier watch and enjoyed three nights on a six-star cruise from Nice to Saint Tropez. In return, Scourfield, who had previously pleaded guilty to charges relating to his role in the scam last year, agreed to give inappropriate loans to struggling businesses, which allowed Mills and his associates to profit from imposing high consultancy fees on those firms. Many of the businesses went bankrupt as a result and some of the owners lost their homes. Stephen Rowland, of the Crown Prosecution Service fraud division, said: \u201cThis had a very real impact on a lot of people, individuals who had worked had to build up companies.\u201d Mills, who faces the potential of a long prison term along with Scourfield, was convicted alongside his wife Alison, 51, their associates Michael Bancroft, 73, and Tony Cartwright, 72, for their various roles in running the fraud between 2003 and 2007. Mark Dobson, 56, another HBOS banker who used to work under Scourfield, was also found guilty. A seventh man, accountant Jonathan Cohen, 57, was acquitted. Scourfield was in charge of corporate customers experiencing financial difficulties at HBOS\u2019s branch in Reading, Berkshire, until he resigned in 2007. He received gifts of clothes, jewellery, luxury hotels, business-class flights and expensive meals at an oyster bar and a cheesecake restaurant, the jury heard during a four-month trial. The court was told how more than \u00a328m passed from HBOS through the bank accounts of either Mills, his wife or companies under his control, although not all of that sum was retained by the financier. Mills\u2019s wife also played an active role in the scheme, inviting Scourfield and his wife, plus Dobson, to go on trips to Ascot racecourse. Meanwhile Mills, Bancroft, Scourfield and their wives holidayed together in Barbados to celebrate Alison Mills\u2019 40th birthday. Aside from stories of high end holidays, luxury yachts and expensive jewellery, the court also heard less glamorous evidence, including how Scourfield would receive regular bribes in the form of envelopes stuffed with thousands of pounds in cash to pay for sex workers at a flat in Marylebone, central London. One woman who worked at Fantasy \u2013 a pornographic magazine company under Scourfield\u2019s portfolio \u2013 said she was asked to arrange girls for the \u201cposh twat banker friends\u201d. A diary entry from one of the sex workers read: \u201cMet guys, me, Amber and Suzie. Chinese meal. Then drinks at flat and quick shag. Easy \u00a31,500.\u201d Rowland said: \u201cThere was a very seedy side to this case and that\u2019s indicative of the kind of mindset and the kind of sleazy elements of these kinds of crimes.\u201d The prosecution was brought after a six-year investigation by Thames Valley police that involved 150 officers who sifted through about 500,000 documents. Three rooms were needed to house the evidence collected during the investigation. Scourfield pleaded guilty in August to six counts, including conspiracy to corrupt. Mills and Bancroft were found guilty of six and five counts respectively, including conspiracy to corrupt and fraudulent trading. Alison Mills was convicted of one count of money laundering. Dobson and Cartwright were both convicted on two counts. Sentencing is scheduled for Thursday.",

Mark Dobson, 56, another HBOS banker who used to work under Scourfield, was also found guilty.</p> <p>A seventh man, accountant Jonathan Cohen, 57, was acquitted.</p> <p>Scourfield was in charge of corporate customers experiencing financial difficulties at HBOS\u2019s branch in Reading, Berkshire, until he resigned in 2007. </p> <p>He received gifts of clothes, jewellery, luxury hotels, business-class flights and expensive meals at an oyster bar and a cheesecake restaurant, the jury heard during a four-month trial.</p> <p>The court was told how more than \u00a328m passed from HBOS through the bank accounts of either Mills, his wife or companies under his control, although not all of that sum was retained by the financier.</p> <p>Mills\u2019s wife also played an active role in the scheme, inviting Scourfield and his wife, plus Dobson, to go on trips to Ascot racecourse. Meanwhile Mills, Bancroft, Scourfield and their wives holidayed together in Barbados to celebrate Alison Mills\u2019 40th birthday.</p> <p>Aside from stories of high end holidays, luxury yachts and expensive jewellery, the court also heard less glamorous evidence, including how Scourfield would receive regular bribes in the form of envelopes stuffed with thousands of pounds in cash to pay for sex workers at a flat in Marylebone, central London.</p> <p>One woman who worked at Fantasy \u2013 a pornographic magazine company under Scourfield\u2019s portfolio \u2013 said she was asked to arrange girls for the \u201cposh twat banker friends\u201d.</p> <p>A diary entry from one of the sex workers read: \u201cMet guys, me, Amber and Suzie. Chinese meal. Then drinks at flat and quick shag. Easy \u00a31,500.\u201d</p> <p>Rowland said: \u201cThere was a very seedy side to this case and that\u2019s indicative of the kind of mindset and the kind of sleazy elements of these kinds of crimes.\u201d </p> <p>The prosecution was brought after a six-year investigation by Thames Valley police that involved 150 officers who sifted through about 500,000 documents. Three rooms were needed to house the evidence collected during the investigation.</p> <p>Scourfield pleaded guilty in August to six counts, including conspiracy to corrupt.</p> <p>Mills and Bancroft were found guilty of six and five counts respectively, including conspiracy to corrupt and fraudulent trading. Alison Mills was convicted of one count of money laundering.</p> <p>Dobson and Cartwright were both convicted on two counts. </p> <p>Sentencing is scheduled for Thursday.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Weetabix has warned that it may become the latest consumer brand to raise prices this year as a result of the pound\u2019s slump since the Brexit vote. The breakfast cereal manufacturer said if prices were to go up, the increases would probably be in the \u201clow single digits\u201d. During a BBC interview, Giles Turrell, the Weetabix chief executive, said price rises would be a \u201clast resort\u201d. Although the company harvests wheat in Northamptonshire, it is sold in US dollars on global markets, meaning the cost in pounds to buy wheat in the UK has gone up. Like other packaged food makers, it has been squeezed by the plunging value of sterling since last June, which has raised the cost of imported goods or globally traded commodities priced in US dollars. On Monday, Weetabix said it was in discussions with retailers about price increases. \u201cWe would always look to mitigate cost pressure, but unfortunately we are unable to cover all of the cost impacts we\u2019ve been faced with recently,\u201d it said in a statement. Several food companies, including Unilever, which owns Marmite and Magnum ice cream, the Mr Kipling maker Premier Foods, and Mondelez International, the owner of Cadbury, have increased prices in the UK or warned they will do so to offset the weakness of the pound. Unilever\u2019s decision to raise the price of Marmite by 10% last October led to a dispute with Tesco and predictions of further price increases this year. Weetabix, an 85-year-old brand that includes cereals and breakfast drinks, was taken over by Bright Food in 2012, when the Chinese state-owned company bought a controlling stake from private equity firm Lion Capital. The business is reported to be up for sale. The company announced a \u00a330m capital investment programme up to 2018 across its UK manufacturing sites in Burton Latimer and Corby. Food and drink is by far the UK\u2019s largest manufacturing sector, accounting for 16% of total manufacturing by turnover (\u00a383.7bn a year) and directly employing about 400,000 people across 6,620 businesses.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "At the height of the credit boom in 2005, a financier was sent by his boss to a corporate flat in Portman Square in London\u2019s West End. In his hand was an envelope containing about \u00a34,000 in cash for which he had been given specific instructions. He was to hand the package to a business contact called Lynden Scourfield, then a lead director of the HBOS\u2019s impaired assets division, who was expected to be entertaining guests in the apartment. Or, if the banker wasn\u2019t in residence, the cash was to be left for him in \u201cthe blue drawer\u201d, which referred to the spot that was also used to store Viagra for sex parties. That might all seem like the preamble for a new Netflix series, on which the scriptwriters still have to do a bit of work. But it was the scene-setter that greeted jurors at Southwark crown court in September, as they prepared to hear a fraud case relating to one of the crustiest of finance sectors, corporate banking. This is the seemingly tired old trade of lending money to businesses. Still, the narrative took the courtroom back to a financial period when almost any indulgence was encouraged \u2013 and was justified by unremarkable operators who assumed their own genius was making them rich. However, now it can be reported for the first time that Scourfield, 54, is corrupt, and pleaded guilty last year to six counts relating to his role in a scheme that cost the bank \u00a3245m. On Monday his business associate David Mills, 60, who ran a small business turnaround consultancy Quayside Corporate Services (QCS), Mills\u2019s wife. Alison, 51, plus their associates Michael Bancroft, 73, and Tony Cartwright, 72, were all convicted for their roles in helping to run Scourfield\u2019s scam. A sixth man, Mark Dobson, 56, who worked for Scourfield at HBOS, was also convicted, while one other defendant, Jonathan Cohen, 57, was acquitted. Despite his absence from the courtroom having changed his plea last year, Scourfield\u2019s presence loomed over proceedings each day of the four-month trial. The jury heard more lurid stories of those parties held in the London flat, which prompted one sex worker to comment on Scourfield\u2019s movie star looks (sadly for him, Danny de Vito). They also heard how, apart from funding the evening entertainments, Mills also applied to have a second card on his American Express account, which was issued under Scourfield\u2019s name. That Amex card was used to pay for, among other things, a \u00a35,880, three-day cruise between Nice and St Tropez in October 2004, which was booked by Scourfield for himself and his wife, as well as the Millses. It also shows a booking for a seven-day jaunt for the Scourfields after boarding the Grand Princess cruise ship in Miami earlier that year, plus on-board expenses totalling $2,769 (\u00a32,215), of which $1,580 was spent in the ship\u2019s gift and jewellery shop. In return for Mills\u2019s generosity, the prosecution alleged, Scourfield would use his position within HBOS to make some demands of his clients and their struggling businesses, such as hiring Mills as an expensive adviser to firms before they could receive loans. In some cases, the jury was told, Mills and his associates also took control of the struggling companies, running them for their own benefit. \u201cScourfield advanced huge sums to the businesses, and continued to do so well past the point when it would have been obvious to any honest banker that the bank debt could and would never be repaid,\u201d Brian O\u2019Neill QC, prosecuting, told the court. He added that more than \u00a328m passed from HBOS through the bank accounts of either Mills, his wife or companies under his control \u2013 and while not all of that money stayed with the defendants, Mills and his wife \u201cdid benefit enormously\u201d. But who was hurt by all this? Lloyds Banking Group is one victim. It had taken over HBOS, was rescued by the taxpayer and was subsequently forced to write off \u00a3250m from its impaired assets division. Of that sum, \u00a3245m related to bank customers under Scourfield\u2019s management. Meanwhile, campaigners say that lives of some of the people running the businesses have been ruined as they watched firms they had built up being milked. All of which was allowed by the lax controls within the bank, the jury was told. The court heard how the HBOS computer system permitted bankers to approve credit positions of clients without approval. The manager who discovered the scam described the failings as \u201castounding\u201d. Giving evidence in court, Tom Angus, who took control of the bank\u2019s impaired assets in July 2006, recalled how he had produced an internal review in 2007 focussing on 38 struggling businesses, each of which had received \u201cirregular\u201d loans and which together owed the bank \u00a3375m. All 38 were supervised by Scourfield. After his review, Angus had been left with \u201cthe clear impression that Lynden [Scourfield] had been agreeing substantial amounts of credit to distressed companies \u2026 completely without his authority and without any authorisation from [his bosses]\u201d. These observations were backed up by the so-called David Miller report, published in May 2007, plus a separate investigation by the HBOS corporate financial crime prevention team, which produced the first of its its three reports on 27 March 2007. Scourfield left the bank on 8 March that year before formally resigning a month later. Yet even after all that, HBOS insisted to victims that there had been nothing wrong with Mills\u2019s QCS. Some of the bank\u2019s former clients told the Guardian they were stunned to hear from the trial that HBOS had investigated loans presided over by Scourfield before the bank told them there had been no fraud. Lloyds insisted on Monday it was only the police that had the ability to investigate if there had been a fraud and added: \u201cThe trial highlighted criminal actions that bear no reflection on the behaviours of the vast majority of the employees of HBOS at the time or in the group today.\u201d All of which does little to alleviate the sense that the period of financial history focused on during the trial was one of a long orgy, kept going artificially with other people\u2019s money. With the benefit of hindsight, Scourfield\u2019s evening entertainments look an apt metaphor.",

All 38 were supervised by Scourfield.</p> <p>After his review, Angus had been left with \u201cthe clear impression that Lynden [Scourfield] had been agreeing substantial amounts of credit to distressed companies \u2026 completely without his authority and without any authorisation from [his bosses]\u201d.</p> <p>These observations were backed up by the so-called David Miller report, published in May 2007, plus a separate investigation by the HBOS corporate financial crime prevention team, which produced the first of its its three reports on 27 March 2007. Scourfield left the bank on 8 March that year before formally resigning a month later.</p> <p>Yet even after all that, HBOS insisted to victims that there had been nothing wrong with Mills\u2019s QCS.</p> <p>Some of the bank\u2019s former clients told the Guardian they were stunned to hear from the trial that HBOS had investigated loans presided over by Scourfield before the bank told them there had been no fraud.</p> <p>Lloyds insisted on Monday it was only the police that had the ability to investigate if there had been a fraud and added: \u201cThe trial highlighted criminal actions that bear no reflection on the behaviours of the vast majority of the employees of HBOS at the time or in the group today.\u201d</p> <p>All of which does little to alleviate the sense that the period of financial history focused on during the trial was one of a long orgy, kept going artificially with other people\u2019s money. With the benefit of hindsight, Scourfield\u2019s evening entertainments look an apt metaphor.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Ministers should ban coal power stations from a scheme paying their owners subsidies to provide backup power, a leading energy company and green energy group have urged. Scottish Power and RenewableUK said it was an \u201cobvious paradox\u201d and \u201ccounterproductive\u201d that the government had committed to closing all coal power stations by 2025 while continuing to support them through the capacity market, its system for ensuring power when supplies are low. Three major coal power plants closed last year, largely because of the impact of the government\u2019s carbon tax. But coal is still expected to win a significant number of contracts in a capacity market auction starting on Tuesday to provide backup power next winter, paid through subsidies levied on household energy bills. Scottish Power, one of the UK\u2019s big six energy companies, said it was time to exclude coal from future auctions, the first of which is due in December. \u201cAs coal has to be replaced by 2025, we think that the government should now consider introducing an emissions restriction as part of the qualifying criteria for the next auction in December and any subsequent such auctions,\u201d said Keith Anderson, the chief corporate officer of Scottish Power. As the most carbon-intensive fuel, coal would likely fall foul of any such restriction. \u201cReplacing old coal with new gas is by far the cheapest way of reducing carbon emissions from the power sector and securing supply,\u201d Anderson added. The company wants to build a new gas power station, but lost out for that plant in the last capacity market auction after the price went relatively low, disappointing government hopes of encouraging new gas power stations to be built. Emma Pinchbeck, the executive director of trade group RenewableUK, echoed the call to end subsidies for coal. \u201cEveryone knows that it\u2019s game over for coal. It would be counterproductive to throw bill-payers\u2019 money away on a dirty technology which the government has quite rightly committed to phasing out by 2025.\u201d She added that the government\u2019s upcoming vision of a more flexible, smarter energy system could show how to keep electricity supplies secure without relying on \u201cold-fashioned, unclean and unreliable\u201d coal. Steve Holliday, the former chief executive of National Grid, which oversees the capacity market auctions, told the Guardian it was important to consider that in the future the power grid would be more flexible and capable of coping with peaks in demand. \u201cBy 2022 we should have half-hour metering which means lots more business customers can be flexible on their electricity demand; the government says all homes will have smart meters so even if you\u2019re pessimistic the vast majority will have a smart meter; and there will be a lot more battery storage,\u201d he said. \u201cSo let\u2019s not commit to big central generation [such as gas or coal] too soon.\u201d One senior industry figure said the Scottish Power proposals were sensible, but others said it would be better to target diesel generators, which have won lucrative capacity market subsidies. Uniper, the company formed to take care of E.ON\u2019s fossil fuel operations when the German group split its businesses, rejected the idea of a ban. \u201cThe capacity auctions to date clearly indicate that a phased closure of coal is already happening and a ban seems neither the best way forward to ensure consumers get the best deal, nor to ensure security of supply,\u201d said a spokeswoman for the company, which runs Ratcliffe coal plant in Nottinghamshire. SSE, which operates the Fiddler\u2019s Ferry coal power station in Cheshire, also disputed the need to ban coal from the capacity market. Analysts predict the auction this week, which is designed to guarantee backup power in the winter of 2017-18, would fetch a higher price than previous ones. Cornwall Energy said it expected a clearing price of \u00a323 to \u00a328 a kilowatt, compared with \u00a322.50 in the last auction, but coal power generators would drive the price down with bids of \u00a320 to \u00a330. \u201cOlder, less efficient plants will play a greater role in meeting the envelope [of backup capacity] than we have seen before,\u201d the group said. Coal operators have previously won agreements to provide a considerable 6.1 gigawatts (GW) of capacity in the winter of 2020-21, down from 9.2GW in 2018-19. \u201cWe are already seeing a significant reduction in the role that coal will play in the capacity market year on year,\u201d said a government spokesman. Holliday said the use of \u201cBlackout Britain\u201d headlines should end. \u201cWe\u2019ve been talking about blackouts for 15 years every time it gets cold, but it\u2019s a scare story,\u201d he told the BBC. The Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, a UK-based thinktank, said the former grid boss\u2019s comments were refreshing, and noted that none of the UK\u2019s reserve power had been called on this winter.",

      "bodyText": "Volkswagen has become the world\u2019s biggest car manufacturer, overtaking Toyota in the number of new vehicles sold in 2016 despite the damage it suffered in the diesel emissions scandal. Toyota had been the biggest seller for the past four years but its 2016 sales total of just under 10.2m vehicles, announced on Monday, fell short of the more than 10.3m cars sold by VW. General Motors is reporting its 2016 sales next week, but industry analysts said it had no chance of overtaking VW. GM was third behind VW last year and held the top spot in 2011, when Toyota\u2019s production was disrupted by the Japanese earthquake and tsunami. It marks the first time that the German manufacturer has become the global bestseller, a record it has achieved despite having being beset by scandal for rigging emissions tests for its diesel vehicles. Riding out prosecutions, fines and vehicle recalls in the US, the VW group \u2013 which includes the Audi, Porsche and Skoda brands \u2013 recorded an overall 3.8% rise from 2015. A major contribution was booming sales growth of 12% in a year in China, where VW sells few diesel vehicles. But the figures suggest that VW\u2019s brand has not been seriously damaged in the eyes of consumers. However, David Bailey, professor of industrial strategy at Aston University, said: \u201cIt may seem odd that they\u2019ve taken No 1 spot now, but they may have been further ahead; market share in Europe and sales in the US have dropped for VW. But its Audi brand is very powerful in China, selling more than half a million a year, and dieselgate is a non-issue there.\u201d He said that VW\u2019s diesel problems had arisen in the process of meeting huge growth targets set by its former chief executive, Martin Winterkorn. \u201cToyota had put growth ahead of quality until their own scandal in 2009. Both of them had the growth bug and got into problems as a result of that.\u201d Toyota, which had to recall millions of vehicles due to safety fears over faulty accelerator pedals in 2009-10, now says it is not concerned with maintaining pole position on sales. In a statement, the manufacturer said: \u201cAt Toyota, we are not focused on chasing volume. We believe that our sales volume is just the result of our focus on making ever-better cars and providing better customer experiences. Our goal is to be No. 1 with consumers by engineering and producing ever-better cars.\u201d Toyota\u2019s domestic sales grew, but the Japanese market is small compared with the US, where its sales fell. With the manufacturer having already been the subject of a barrage of tweeted warnings from President Trump before he took office over its plans to locate factories in Mexico, its problems there may be growing. Chevrolet and Cadillac maker General Motors had been the top-selling carmaker for more than 70 years until Toyota took that mantle in 2008.",

      "bodyText": "Brexiters toasting an impending exit from the EU with a pint of ale could be in for a sobering shock, after some of Britain\u2019s top brewers warned that the weak pound is putting the craft beer revolution at risk. The country\u2019s brewery industry has been enjoying a renaissance, with about 200 new breweries a year adding to the choice for drinkers. But small-scale brewing is already feeling the pinch from the slump in sterling, which has sent the cost of imported ingredients and equipment soaring. Now drinkers, already asked to pay more than \u00a35 a pint for some independent brews, are being warned that they may have to accept price rises or switch to cheaper mass-market brands. Unlike multinational beer companies behind such brands, which are not immune to the weak pound but spend relatively little on ingredients, craft brewers scour the globe for the best hops and malt, often preferring overseas varieties. \u201cEverybody\u2019s noticed it and it\u2019s to be expected because you\u2019re importing hops from places like the US and Europe,\u201d said Andrew Paterson, head brewer at Dark Star Brewing in West Sussex. \u201cIt\u2019s also the case for steel tanks, kegs, yeast manufactured in Holland, anything that\u2019s imported. We\u2019re not going to compromise on quality so it\u2019s an ongoing cost.\u201d Fabio Israel, head brewer at Bedlam Brewery, says the Brexit effect is making it harder for firms such as his to grow. Bedlam, which like Dark Star is also based in West Sussex, is planning to build a new brewery and Israel reckons the investment cost has gone up from about \u00a3500,000 to \u00a3600,000. He has also been forced to pay more for malt from Germany, yeast from France and hops from the US and the Czech Republic. The end result, says Israel, is that beer companies must either risk their own survival by absorbing cost increases, or ask consumers to fork out more. \u201cWe\u2019ll work hard to keep costs where they are but everything is getting more expensive and we\u2019re likely at some stage to pass these costs on to publicans.\u201d While established independent brewers with a loyal customer base can wield some pricing power, cost increases pose more of a threat for newcomers. Neil Randle had just launched Bang On Brewery in Bridgend, Wales, when the Brexit result sent the pound into a tailspin. \u201cWithin our first month of trading, the price of pretty much everything has gone up,\u201d he said. \u201cBrewers work on pretty tight margins. Pubs are already trying to squeeze the margins to increase their profits so we\u2019re being squeezed from both ends.\u201d The flip side of the devalued pound is that brewers\u2019 pain could be British farmers\u2019 gain. The price of hops was on the rise well before the EU vote, owing to increasing demand for hop-heavy craft beers and limited supply. \u201cImported varieties are more expensive due to the drop in the value of the pound so British brewers using these varieties have taken a double hit on the price,\u201d says Paul Corbett, managing director of hop merchant Charles Faram. \u201cThe good news for British hop growers is that their hops are much more competitive and they are now seeing increasing demand.\u201d Gavin Hogg, managing director of Salcombe Brewery in Devon, has witnessed the same effect in the price of barley. \u201cUK barley is very attractive to overseas buyers right now so that\u2019s pushing up the price for us by about \u00a350 per tonne.\u201d But while some brewers are considering switching to British-grown ingredients, Hogg is among those far from thrilled about that prospect. He says UK soil is not right for growing some types of hops such as Citra and Mount Rainier. \u201cThe Americans produce really good hop varieties and we don\u2019t in the UK, so we\u2019re at the whim and mercy of the exchange rate,\u201d he adds. Hogg says Salcombe has begun buying more hops in advance to hedge against any further falls in the pound. Daniel Lowe, co-founder of London brewery Fourpure, took a different route, buying euros before the EU referendum to insulate the business against currency risk. For brewers who export, there is some upside. \u201cFive days after the [Brexit] vote, when the pound dropped to \u20ac1.20, we exported our first pallet to Germany,\u201d says Israel. \u201cThe buyer didn\u2019t want to buy but five days after Brexit we offered a 15% discount, which was basically the drop in the pound.\u201d However, Israel warns that the export benefits are far outweighed by import costs. That leaves drinkers with a Hobson\u2019s choice: pay more for beer, or risk seeing their favourite brewers go out of business. The Society of Independent Brewers (SIBA), which represents 850 breweries in the UK, is hoping ale enthusiasts are prepared to dig deeper into their wallets. \u201cIt is important that beer drinkers understand the challenges that face Britain\u2019s independent brewers in terms of rising costs but also the fundamental truth that craft beers rely heavily on quality, often imported ingredients,\u201d said its managing director, Mike Benner. \u201cIndependent brewers use these quality ingredients purely for their flavour, which means consumers are getting very good value for money when they choose an independent craft beer.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Starbucks has promised to hire 10,000 refugees over five years in response to Donald Trump\u2019s executive order temporarily barring refugees access to the US and banning entry for anyone from seven majority Muslim countries. The move came as leading US companies including Alphabet, Amazon, Ford, Goldman Sachs and Microsoft came out against the policy. Howard Schultz, the coffee chain\u2019s chief executive, said he had \u201cdeep concern\u201d about the president\u2019s order and would be taking \u201cresolute\u201d action, starting with offering jobs to refugees. \u201cWe are developing plans to hire 10,000 of them over five years in the 75 countries around the world where Starbucks does business,\u201d he told employees in a strongly worded note. He added that the move was to make clear the company \u201cwill neither stand by, nor stand silent, as the uncertainty around the new administration\u2019s actions grows with each passing day\u201d. Schultz said the initial focus would be in the US and for refugees who had served as interpreters for the US military, but it is not yet clear when the five-year period would begin, or whether people would be employed directly by Starbucks or by suppliers. Schultz added that the Seattle-based company had also contacted employees who had been affected by the immigration ban. The move met with both support and a backlash on social media. The hashtag #BoycottStarbucks was trending on Twitter on Monday morning, with people praising and condemning the company\u2019s move. Starbucks\u2019 move came as leading banks, car companies and technology firms voiced concern at the executive order. On Sunday, the Goldman Sachs chief, Lloyd Blankfein, left a voice message for staff that warned the plan could create \u201cdisruption\u201d for the bank and its staff, according to a transcript seen by Reuters. \u201cThis is not a policy we support, and I would note that it has already been challenged in federal court, and some of the order has been enjoined at least temporarily,\u201d Blankfein said. Ford\u2019s executive chairman, Bill Ford Jr, and chief executive, Mark Fields, also condemned the travel ban in a statement to staff. \u201cWe do not support this policy or any other that goes against our values as a company,\u201d they said. Technology firms were the first to come out publicly against Trump\u2019s plans. Satya Nadella, Microsoft\u2019s CEO, said that as an immigrant himself, he would \u201ccontinue to advocate\u201d on the issue. \u201cAs an immigrant and as a CEO, I\u2019ve both experienced and seen the positive impact that immigration has on our company, for the country, and for the world,\u201d he wrote on LinkedIn, the business networking site owned by the group. Microsoft\u2019s president, Brad Smith, said 76 employees had been affected by the 90-day ban on entry for citizens from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. In an email to Microsoft staff, he said: \u201cWe believe that immigration laws can and should protect the public without sacrificing people\u2019s freedom of expression or religion. And we believe in the importance of protecting legitimate and law-abiding refugees whose very lives may be at stake in immigration proceedings.\u201d On Sunday, the Google co-founder and Alphabet president, Sergey Brin, was photographed among people protesting at San Francisco international airport over the immigration measures. Brin said he was there in a personal capacity, but reportedly told one journalist: \u201cI\u2019m here because I\u2019m a refugee.\u201d A Google spokeswoman said: \u201cWe\u2019re concerned about the impact of this order and any proposals that could impose restrictions on Googlers and their families, or that could create barriers to bringing great talent to the US. We\u2019ll continue to make our views on these issues known to leaders in Washington and elsewhere.\u201d On Monday, the billionaire investor Mark Cuban added his voice to Trump\u2019s critics. Cuban, who campaigned for Hillary Clinton during the election, told CNBC that in person Trump seemed reasonable and open-minded. \u201cBut all that is thrown out the window when he tweets and when he communicates with the media,\u201d he said. \u201cThis dichotomy makes things very difficult for business.\u201d Cuban said that Google, Microsoft and others had already had their businesses disrupted by Trump\u2019s travel restrictions and that they were making life more confusing for employers of foreign-born workers. \u201cNow you have to give consideration to where they\u2019re from, what their circumstances are, what type of travel that person is doing. Are they a risk? How does that impact my future hiring?\u201d",

Satya Nadella<strong>,</strong> Microsoft\u2019s CEO, said that as an immigrant himself, he would \u201ccontinue to advocate\u201d on the issue. \u201cAs an immigrant and as a CEO, I\u2019ve both experienced and seen the positive impact that immigration has on our company, for the country, and for the world,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/yesterdays-us-executive-order-immigration-satya-nadella?trk=prof-post\">he wrote on LinkedIn</a>, the business networking site owned by the group. </p> \n<p>Microsoft\u2019s president, Brad Smith, said 76 employees had been affected by the 90-day ban on entry for citizens from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2017/jan/29/trump-refugee-ban-airport-protests\" data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5zdf2\" data-show-ads=\"true\" data-video-id=\"3139481\" data-video-name=\"Crowds gather at US airports to protest Trump's immigration ban \u2013 video\" data-video-provider=\"AP/Reuters/The Guardian\"> \n <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-588d688ee4b0860ce5569da7\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> \n  <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2017/01/29/170129AirportProtestsUpdate_desk.mp4\">\n  <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2017/01/29/170129AirportProtestsUpdate.m3u8\">\n  <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2017/01/29/170129AirportProtestsUpdate_WebM.webm\"> \n </video> \n <figcaption>\n  <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2017/jan/29/trump-refugee-ban-airport-protests\">Crowds gather at US airports to protest Trump\u2019s immigration ban</a>\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>In an email to Microsoft staff, he said: \u201cWe believe that immigration laws can and should protect the public without sacrificing people\u2019s freedom of expression or religion. And we believe in the importance of protecting legitimate and law-abiding refugees whose very lives may be at stake in immigration proceedings.\u201d</p> \n<p>On Sunday, the Google co-founder and Alphabet president, Sergey Brin, was photographed among people protesting at San Francisco international airport over the immigration measures. Brin said he was there in a personal capacity, but reportedly told one journalist: \u201cI\u2019m here because I\u2019m a refugee.\u201d</p> \n<p>A Google spokeswoman said: \u201cWe\u2019re concerned about the impact of this order and any proposals that could impose restrictions on Googlers and their families, or that could create barriers to bringing great talent to the US. We\u2019ll continue to make our views on these issues known to leaders in Washington and elsewhere.\u201d<br></p> \n<p>On Monday, the billionaire investor Mark Cuban added his voice to Trump\u2019s critics. Cuban, who campaigned for Hillary Clinton during the election, <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2017/01/30/mark-cuban-takes-issue-with-trumps-management-style-says-everything-seems-rushed.html\">told CNBC</a> that in person Trump seemed reasonable and open-minded. \u201cBut all that is thrown out the window when he tweets and when he communicates with the media,\u201d he said. \u201cThis dichotomy makes things very difficult for business.\u201d</p> \n<p>Cuban said that Google, Microsoft and others had already had their businesses disrupted by Trump\u2019s travel restrictions and that they were making life more confusing for employers of foreign-born workers.</p> \n<p>\u201cNow you have to give consideration to where they\u2019re from, what their circumstances are, what type of travel that person is doing. Are they a risk? How does that impact my future hiring?\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Almost every British city depends on the EU more than any other market for their exports, according to a new analysis that underscores the risks to the jobs and growth from a hard Brexit deal. Research by the respected thinktank Centre for Cities found British cities would have to dramatically increase trade with other international markets to compensate for a downturn in exports to the EU once the UK leaves the bloc. Almost half, or 46%, of exports from urban centres go to the EU, compared with just 15% to the US and 4% to China. The focus on exports in the thinktank\u2019s annual healthcheck on cities follows Theresa May\u2019s speech this month setting out a vision for a \u201cglobal Britain\u201d. In her first key announcement on Brexit, the prime minister also confirmed the government planned to take the UK out of the EU single market. That plan has raised fears for the UK\u2019s long-term prosperity, given its strong reliance on the EU as a trading partner. The Centre for Cities said its report showed the importance of getting a new EU trade deal in Brexit talks. It says that while UK cities cover just 8% of land in the UK, they account for 54% of the population, 60% of jobs and 62% of all exports. Data from 2014 shows 61 of the 62 places the thinktank defines as cities send more goods and services to the EU than anywhere else. In the one exception, Hull, almost a third of exports are to the EU, while 46% go to the US thanks to the city\u2019s strong overseas sales of pharmaceutical and medical goods. Nurofen maker Reckitt Benckiser has a research and development centre in Hull. The thinktank\u2019s chief executive, Alexandra Jones, said protecting and promoting exports from cities would be key to improving the UK\u2019s productivity performance and ensuring living standards continue to rise. \u201cSecuring the best possible EU trade deal will be critical for the prosperity of cities across Britain, and should be the government\u2019s top priority as we prepare to leave the single market and potentially the customs union,\u201d she said. \u201cWhile it\u2019s right to be ambitious about increasing exports to countries such as the US and China, the outcome of EU trade negotiations will have a much bigger impact on places and people up and down the country.\u201d Some supporters of leaving the European single market have argued the move would free the UK from the bloc\u2019s protectionism and also push British businesses to seek trade with faster growing markets further afield. But the Centre for Cities report estimated trade with non-EU markets would have to rise substantially to fill the gap of any EU trade downturn. For example, to make up for a 10% decrease in exports to the EU, British cities would have to nearly double exports to China. The thinktank also urges the government to seek trade agreements covering as many sectors as possible, rather than prioritising deals for high-profile industries based in a small number of places. It notes that some places like Sunderland, where carmaker Nissan is based, are heavily reliant on a specific industry but they form the minority of cities \u2013 a total of seven. \u201cFor most cities, their exports are generated by a range of industries. In total, 35 cities had less than one-fifth of their exports concentrated in one industry,\u201d the report notes. It found a north/south divide. Places in the north and Midlands mainly export goods, which make up almost 90% of exports from Derby and Hull, for example. Southern cities have a much greater reliance on exporting services, with nine out of the top 10 cities located in the south of England. The report\u2019s analysis of cities\u2019 trade links with the EU showed Exeter was most reliant on it for exports, with 70% going to the bloc. The city exports across a range of industries, including transport equipment, insurance and pensions. Exeter is followed by Plymouth, Bristol, Mansfield, Cardiff and Aberdeen, which all send 60% or more of their exports to the EU. The city least reliant on the EU for exports was Derby, home to Rolls-Royce. A quarter \u2013 25% \u2013 of its exports go to the EU, 22% to the US and 5% to China. For Hull, 29% of exports to go the EU, 46% to the US and 2% to China.",
