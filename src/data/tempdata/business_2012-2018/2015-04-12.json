      "bodyText": "Greece has denied being intransigent in its dealings with eurozone officials, ahead of another crucial week for the cash-strapped country. Greece\u2019s finance ministry dismissed on Sunday a report by a German newspaper which reported that eurozone officials were \u201cdisappointed\u201d by Greece\u2019s failure to come up with plans for economic reforms at last week\u2019s talks in Brussels. The mood between Greece\u2019s leftist government and its eurozone partners has remained tense during negotiations to determine whether or not the country qualifies for further financial aid from international lenders. Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung (FAS) cited officials at last week\u2019s meeting as saying they were shocked by the lack of progress, and that the new Greek representative just asked where the money was \u2013 \u201clike a taxi driver\u201d \u2013 and insisted his country would soon be bankrupt. Eurozone officials disagreed with this assessment, saying Athens was still able to meet its international obligations, and regarded its ability to pay public sector wages and pensions as a domestic problem, according to the report. They deplored Greece\u2019s unwillingness to discuss cuts to public sector pensions. The finance ministry in Athens hit back on Sunday, saying: \u201cWhen the readers of FAS read the minutes \u2026 the newspaper will have difficulty justifying its headline and the content of its article. Such reports undermine the negotiation and Europe.\u201d Greece made a \u20ac450m loan repayment to the International Monetary Fund last week. A further \u20ac747m payment is due on 12 May. There are fears that Athens could run out of cash in coming weeks. It needs to pay out more than \u20ac1.5bn of social security payments for April this week. IMF managing director Christine Lagarde said last week that talks between Greece and its creditors had been \u201cdifficult on almost a daily basis\u201d. She added: \u201cWhat really matters now is for Greece and the three institutions to get on with the work so we can identify together the measures that will take Greece out of the very bad economic situation it could be in if those measures are not taken.\u201d A meeting of deputy finance ministers \u2013 called the Euro Working Group \u2013 last Thursday gave Athens six working days to come up with a convincing economic reform plan before eurozone finance ministers meet on 24 April to decide whether to unlock \u20ac7.2bn of bailout funds. Greece has been on the verge of bankruptcy since 2009 and has depended on rescue loans totalling \u20ac240bn from the EU and IMF to stay afloat. Technical teams from Greece and its international lenders held a teleconference on Saturday to set the agenda of talks in the coming days, a Greek finance ministry official said. Negotiations are expected to restart on Monday, between technical officials in Athens and Brussels. Analysts at Daiwa Capital Markets said: \u201cAn intense week lies ahead for the cash-starved Greek government ... The onus [is] on Greece to smooth out the many points of contention with the Brussels group next week in continuous discussions at both technical and political levels.\u201d Meanwhile, the head of the country\u2019s Orthodox church said at the weekend it was willing to put its land and property up for development to raise money to repay Greek debt. The church owns more land than any party except the state, including prime land and property in Athens. \u201cCome, let\u2019s develop [property] for Greece,\u201d Archbishop Ieronymos of Athens told Greek TV during the Greek Orthodox Easter holiday. \u201cIf needed by the state to cooperate, we\u2019re here.\u201d However, he ruled out selling off property and did not spell out what kind of business developments he was thinking of. Critics say the church owns too much property and does not pay enough tax, at a time when ordinary Greeks\u2019 bills have soared during the economic crisis.",

They deplored Greece\u2019s unwillingness to discuss cuts to public sector pensions.</p> <p>The finance ministry in Athens hit back on Sunday, saying: \u201cWhen the readers of FAS read the minutes \u2026 the newspaper will have difficulty justifying its headline and the content of its article. Such reports undermine the negotiation and Europe.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/apr/09/greeces-459m-debt-payment-to-imf-due-on-thursday\">Greece made a \u20ac450m loan repayment to the International Monetary Fund</a> last week. A further \u20ac747m payment is due on 12 May. There are fears that Athens could run out of cash in coming weeks. It needs to pay out more than \u20ac1.5bn of social security payments for April this week.</p> <p>IMF managing director Christine Lagarde said last week that talks between Greece and its creditors had been \u201cdifficult on almost a daily basis\u201d. She added: \u201cWhat really matters now is for Greece and the three institutions to get on with the work so we can identify together the measures that will take Greece out of the very bad economic situation it could be in if those measures are not taken.\u201d</p> <p>A meeting of deputy finance ministers \u2013 called the Euro Working Group \u2013 last Thursday gave Athens six working days to come up with a convincing economic reform plan before eurozone finance ministers meet on 24 April to decide whether to unlock \u20ac7.2bn of bailout funds. </p> <p>Greece has been on the verge of bankruptcy since 2009 and has depended on rescue loans totalling \u20ac240bn from the EU and IMF to stay afloat.</p> <p>Technical teams from Greece and its international lenders held a teleconference on Saturday to set the agenda of talks in the coming days, a Greek finance ministry official said. Negotiations are expected to restart on Monday, between technical officials in Athens and Brussels.<br></p> <p>Analysts at Daiwa Capital Markets said: \u201cAn intense week lies ahead for the cash-starved Greek government ... The onus [is] on Greece to smooth out the many points of contention with the Brussels group next week in continuous discussions at both technical and political levels.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, the head of the country\u2019s Orthodox church said at the weekend it was willing to put its land and property up for development to raise money to repay Greek debt. The church owns more land than any party except the state, including prime land and property in Athens.<br></p> <p>\u201cCome, let\u2019s develop [property] for Greece,\u201d Archbishop Ieronymos of Athens told Greek TV during the Greek Orthodox Easter holiday. \u201cIf needed by the state to cooperate, we\u2019re here.\u201d</p> <p>However, he ruled out selling off property and did not spell out what kind of business developments he was thinking of.</p> <p>Critics say the church owns too much property and does not pay enough tax, at a time when ordinary Greeks\u2019 bills have soared during the economic crisis.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Tension between the Co-operative Group\u2019s new management and its grassroots membership reignited at the weekend when members demanded the reinstatement of three candidates rejected by the group for election to the board. The 100-strong national members\u2019 council met on Friday and Saturday to discuss the board election and other matters before the Co-op\u2019s annual meeting next month. Allan Leighton, the Co-op\u2019s chairman, and his chief executive, Richard Pennycook, attended. The meeting was said to be professionally conducted but with feelings running high at times as members argued that the mutual group\u2019s democratic principles were at risk. The members\u2019 main complaint was about the selection of candidates for election to the board. On Thursday, Co-op management announced three candidates for the three director posts: former Labour cabinet minister Hazel Blears; Ruth Spellman, chief executive of the Workers\u2019 Educational Association; and Paul Chandler, former CEO of the fair trade group Traidcraft. The group and its recruitment firm rejected three other candidates from a shortlist of six, including Dame Pauline Green, the president of the International Co-operative Alliance, and Nick Eyre, the Co-op\u2019s former group secretary. On Saturday, the council told the group to reinstate the three candidates and called for a fourth member-elected board director to ensure greater representation of members. A member of the council said: \u201cMembers have asked the board to go back to that decision to reinstate all six people on to the ballot paper to make sure members have the say they were meant to have,\u201d said a member who attended the meeting. The decision to present members with just three candidates for three positions was criticised last week by Sir Graham Melmoth, the respected former Co-op boss. Melmoth pointed out that vetoing Green and Eyre meant the board election would not be contested and claimed the three candidates selected had tenuous links to the Co-op. Each candidate needs a majority of votes to be elected. Members also resisted an attempt by the Co-op Group to take a historic step back from direct involvement in politics, by calling on management to withdraw a motion concerning contributions to political parties. That motion asks whether the Co-op should donate to parties, whether it should fund the Co-operative party and whether it should donate to various parties. For the first time in almost a century, the board failed to back a members\u2019 motion endorsing up to \u00a31m of funding for the Co-operative party. The members\u2019 council argued that the board\u2019s three questions were incoherent and unhelpful. They had previously called for continued funding to the Co-operative party \u2013 which is allied with Labour and had 30 MPs in the last parliament. The council also asked the group to withdraw its revised description of the Co-op\u2019s purpose in society: \u201cChampioning a better way of doing business, for you and your communities.\u201d The council\u2019s requests are not binding but the board has an obligation to try to reach agreement. Leighton, the former Royal Mail chairman who joined the Co-op in February, attended the meeting on Friday but was not there when the council made its demands. Pennycook and other officials were asked to leave the room while the council decided on its requests on Saturday. The membership council will be revamped after the AGM. A transitional council was put in place to oversee governance changes recommended by Lord Myners, the former City minister, last year. Veteran Co-op members were unhappy about Myners\u2019 changes but accepted most of them as a way to draw a line under the turmoil created by the near-implosion of the Co-op Bank in 2013. In a statement, Leighton said: \u201cThe Co-operative Group operates under a unique governance model which ensures members have a direct say in the group\u2019s future. After the reforms of last year, this remains a fledgling democracy and we are working to ensure it becomes firmly established so it can operate in the interests of all our members, colleagues and customers whilst avoiding the catastrophic events of our recent past.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain could fall into deflation this week for the first time in more than half a century, the result of an escalating supermarket price war and falling energy prices. Inflation, as measured by the consumer prices index, fell to zero in February for the first time since comparable records began in 1989. Estimates from the Office for National Statistics suggested that it was the lowest reading since 1960. The statistics office will release the latest inflation figures, for March, on Tuesday morning. City economists say it is going to be a close call between a zero reading and a 0.1% dip. Petrol prices rose 3.6% last month, reflecting a rebound in global oil prices, which is expected to push up the inflation rate by 0.1 percentage points. This will be offset, however, by the 5% cut in gas prices by British Gas, Britain\u2019s largest energy supplier, and low food price inflation. Fierce competition from discount chains has forced the major supermarket groups to slash prices on basic items such as bread, with the discounter Aldi overtaking Waitrose to become the UK\u2019s sixth-largest grocer recently. Alan Clarke, an economist at Scotiabank, said: \u201cWhile food price deflation of close to 4% year on year may sound extreme, this represents something of a relief after years of rapid price increases. More specifically, over the seven years between 2007 and 2013, the average annual pace of increase in food price inflation was 5% per year. Enjoy the cheap food and fuel while it lasts!\u201d Even if the UK avoids deflation in March, it will probably enter a period of falling prices at some point soon \u2013 following in the footsteps of other countries. Eurozone inflation has been negative since December, and the US rate turned negative in January before recovering to zero in February. There is no reason to panic, according to the Bank of England and City analysts. They claim any period of UK deflation is likely to prove temporary, unlike the deflationary spiral in Japan, where people have lived with falling prices for two decades. The Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, has sought to allay fears that Britain faces a 1930s-style deflationary spiral, describing the falling oil price as \u201cunambiguously good\u201d for the economy. An oil glut pushed the price of Brent crude, the international benchmark, down by more than 50% from last summer to a six-year low earlier this year. In the last major speech before the central bank went into purdah before the general election, policymaker Ben Broadbent also argued that deflation fears were overblown. \u201cThe likelihood of a broad and protracted deflation, afflicting wages as well as prices, is pretty low,\u201d he said in late March. Low, or non-existent, inflation means that there is no need to raise interest rates any time soon. The City expects the first rate rise, from the current record low of 0.5%, to come late next year. Further rate cuts seem unlikely, however. The Bank\u2019s chief economist, Andy Haldane, recently surprised markets by suggesting rates could be cut again, but Carney and other members of the monetary policy committee disagree strongly, arguing that low inflation is likely to prove temporary. Vicky Redwood, the chief UK economist at Capital Economics, argues that a dose of negative inflation would not be bad for the UK. \u201cWe don\u2019t think that deflation is a bad thing in its current form,\u201d she said. \u201cIt has been driven by a drop in energy and food prices that is helpful for the economy. There is no evidence yet that a more damaging, long-lasting period of deflation is on its way.\u201d She noted that inflation expectations among households rose surprisingly in February. She, along with many other economists, expect inflation to be heading up again by the end of the year. Inflationary pressures could also rise if sterling continues to weaken, which drives up import prices. The pound hit a five-year low against the dollar on Friday, ending the week at $1.4629.",

      "body": "<p>One of America\u2019s biggest banks is going to be protested by an unlikely group on Monday: its employees.</p> <p>Workers at Wells Fargo and their supporters are to gather in front of the bank\u2019s corporate office in Minneapolis to protest the bank\u2019s alleged predatory practice \u2013 mainly the sales quotas imposed on some of its workers. </p> <p>The quotas, <a href=\"http://blog.thomsonreuters.com/index.php/wells-fargos-account-opening-quota-leads-to-fraud-suit-says/\">first exposed in a lawsuit</a> filed by a long-term Wells Fargo customer, David Douglas, have led to at least 30 employees opening duplicate accounts, sometimes without customers\u2019 knowledge, in order to inflate their sales numbers. The 30 employees have been fired, <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-wells-fargo-sale-pressure-20131222-story.html#page=1\">according to the Los Angeles Times</a>. The quotas, however, persist.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I started and was really struggling with meeting my quota, a few of my co-workers approached me and said: \u2018Oh, you are lucky. They reduced the sale quotas\u2019,\u201d Khalid Taha, 27, who works as a personal banker in San Diego, California, told the Guardian. Taha started working for Wells Fargo in November 2013. In 2013, the sales quota for personal bankers like him was to make 20 sales per day, he said. That means bankers had to sell 20 products, such as a new account, overdraft insurance or travel insurance.</p> <p>\u201cI am not sure how that\u2019s possible within an eight-hour day of work. Pretty much every customer takes an hour,\u201d said Taha. Then, beginning in 2014, \u201cthe sales goal dropped to 15 products a day, which is still unreasonable. You don\u2019t sell more than a product per customer. You can, but it\u2019s not that easy. And most of our customers are current customers. They already have several products.\u201d</p> <p>Taha pointed out that customers who visit the bank often just want to get a statement, check their balance, or change their address.</p> <p>\u201cThese are all of the services we are required to do as well. That\u2019s a challenge for us because we open our doors from 9am to 6pm at my branch \u2013 and that\u2019s for both my sales and my customer service goals,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The bank insists that customers are not forced to buy products they don\u2019t use or need. </p> <p>\u201cWe place a high priority on ethical business practices and a culture of doing what is best for our customers. It is in Wells Fargo\u2019s best interest for customers to purchase only the products they need and benefit from \u2013 that\u2019s what keeps them coming back for more for a lifelong relationship,\u201d Richele Messick, the bank\u2019s spokeswoman, told the Guardian in an email.</p> <p>\u201cIt is not in Wells Fargo\u2019s best interest for customers to purchase products and services they don\u2019t use or need.\u201d</p> <p>Wells Fargo employees insist that even if the quotas have been reduced, little has changed since 2013.</p> <p>\u201cNothing has changed,\u201d said Michael Lewis, 46, who works as a financial crime specialist at Wells Fargo in Chandler, Arizona. Lewis has worked for the bank for three years and is one of the people who handle calls disputing charges and fees accrued by the bank\u2019s customers.</p> <p>\u201cBasically, what I do all day is look at people\u2019s bank statements,\u201d he said. \u201cI have kind of an unique experience knowing how America spends its money and knowing how broke everyone is.\u201d</p> <p>While Lewis has no quotas to fill himself, he said he is affected by those imposed on the personal bankers.</p> <p>\u201cIt does affect me in the sense that [the customers] will call and dispute an internal charge \u2013 like a travel insurance charge \u2013 that they never signed up for, and then we will have to address that,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople claim that they have been signed up for bank services that they never agreed to, like overdraft protection.\u201d</p> <p>Lewis has \u201cno concrete proof\u201d that bankers are signing up customers for these services without their knowledge in order to meet the quotas, but \u201cthat is the assumption\u201d, he said.</p> <p>A number of Lewis\u2019s coworkers at the call center have previously worked at the banks and were subject to the quotas. \u201cWhat I see a lot is a sense of relief that they have made it out of the bank,\u201d said Lewis.</p> <p>Back in 2013, when the reports of quotas and their effect on the behavior of tellers first came to lights, Wells Fargo created an ethics program office to \u201clook at existing programs across the company to ensure consistency and a holistic approach\u201d.</p> <p>The bank, the fourth largest in the US by assets, would not say what the creation of this office had accomplished, whether the quotas are still an issue nor whether the quotas had changed.</p> <p>\u201cSales are just one part of our goals, which also include customer experience and ethical behavior,\u201d Messick said. \u201cGoals continually evolve and we regularly monitor and test our goals to ensure they are appropriate and drive behaviors that are in the best interest of customers.\u201d </p> <p>On Monday, Taha will join other bank workers from the country\u2019s biggest banks in the Twin Cities, Minneapolis-St Paul in Minnesota. The workers plan on holding a rally in front of the bank\u2019s corporate office and demand a meeting with the bank\u2019s executives to share their concerns around predatory practices and sales quotas.</p> <p>\u201cWe encourage all of our team members to talk to their managers, participate in the annual team member connection survey, speak to their HR representatives, and use other available channels \u2013 including confidential ethics lines \u2013 to contribute to a constructive dialogue about the team member experience at Wells Fargo,\u201d Messick said.<br></p> <p>Since December 2013, the workers have been collecting signatures on <a href=\"https://www.coworker.org/petitions/wells-fargo-end-the-obsession-with-sales-goals\">a petition calling for an end to sales goals</a>. The workers plan to deliver the petition, which has a little over 10,000 signatures so far, on Monday. Among their other demands are better pay and full-time work. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-2d4d7572-64ca-4e8d-87f9-7a50e0abf348\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/4/10/1428686659028/e4f6be76-3790-4940-b3be-8add57a46a44-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"wells fargo in colorado\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wells Fargo said that all of its salaries are at least 50% above the federal minimum.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: RICK WILKING/REUTERS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Living paycheck to paycheck</h2> <p>Prior to working at Wells Fargo, Lewis worked \u2013 in a similar capacity \u2013 at American Express for almost 10 years.

      "bodyText": "Rarely, if ever, has there been a more parochial election. Apart from the confected row about the renewal of Trident, the two main parties seem curiously indifferent to what is going on beyond Britain\u2019s shores, unless it involves immigration. The assumption is that voters only really care about bread-and-butter domestic issues such as whether they have a job and a roof over their head. Yet it is not so long ago that people took to the streets of Birmingham in 1998 to demand that the G8 countries provided debt relief to the world\u2019s poorest nations. Action followed because it was obvious plenty of voters cared passionately about international development. When the UK next hosted the G8 seven years later, the agenda at Gleneagles was dominated by Africa and the looming threat of climate change. The people who took part in the Jubilee 2000 and Make Poverty History campaigns are still there. They haven\u2019t gone away. The calculation, however, is that there are no votes in development - which is why, when the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank meet in Washington later this week, the talks will not impinge on the election campaign. George Osborne and Ed Balls will be looking to see how they can exploit what the IMF says about the health of the UK economy for domestic political reasons, but that\u2019s about it. This is a shame, not least because the next government will be affected by three sets of issues being discussed in Washington this week. One set involves the current state of the global economy: not just the individual hotspots such as Greece and Ukraine, but how and when central banks start to unwind the unprecedented monetary stimulus provided since 2008-09. Another set involves the future of the so-called Bretton Woods institutions themselves, where the creation of the Asian Infrastructure and Investment Bank is a direct result of the US refusal to back reforms that would give countries such as China, India and Brazil a bigger say in the running of the World Bank and the IMF. The AIIB is a Beijing initiative and will be a rival to the World Bank, an institution that the UK helped found in 1944 and has strongly backed with a rising aid budget in recent years. The final set of issues involves the development agenda for the next 15 years. In July, world leaders will gather in Addis Ababa to discuss how they will finance development. In September, the same cast will gather in New York to set sustainable goals to be achieved by 2030. The caravan then moves on to Paris in December where leaders will try to forge an agreement on climate change. The meetings are linked. Sustainable development goals will only be achievable if there is money on the table. Developing countries will demand help to deal with the impact of climate change if they are to sign up to tougher emission targets. Jim Kim, the president of the World Bank, was right last week when he said that this was the most important year for global development in living memory. Both the main parties have a good story to tell on international development. It was under Labour that the UK committed to meet the UN target of spending 0.7% of national income on aid. It was under the Conservative-led coalition that the target was finally hit. Only three areas of spending have been spared the cuts the government deemed necessary to repair the hole in the public finances left by the recession: the NHS, schools and the Department for International Development. DFID has a programme budget of \u00a311bn a year. David Cameron\u2019s commitment to the 0.7% target before the last election was part of the rebranding of the Conservative party, an indication that it was no longer nasty. It is to the prime minister\u2019s credit that he has stuck to his pledge. There are only five countries that meet or exceed the UN target and Britain is one of them. Aid has not always been well spent. Undoubtedly, it could be used more effectively. Without a commitment to mobilise finance, however, the Addis summit will fail. The number of people living in extreme poverty has halved to just under a billion in the past 25 years, but far too many still lack access to the basics of life: electricity, clean water, sanitation and education. The recent Ebola epidemic in west Africa highlighted the inadequacy of health systems. Kim says extreme poverty can be eradicated through a three-pronged approach: grow, invest and insure. He wants aid to leverage in private capital. The UK\u2019s Overseas Development Institute will publish a paper on Monday [it will appear here] that says the Addis Ababa conference should lay the foundations of a minimum standard of living for all \u2013 a global compact with the world\u2019s poor that would guarantee universal healthcare and education, and the creation of a social safety net to support those on the lowest incomes. The ODI says the price tag would be $73bn a year, assuming poor countries continue to grow at their recent rates and improve tax collection. This looks ambitious at a time when the latest Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development figures show that donors provided $25bn in aid to the poorest countries in 2014, 16% down on the previous year. Kevin Watkins, the ODI\u2019s executive director, says the UK will have influence in the Addis talks should it wish to use it. \u201cThe UK must prioritise pushing for a strong, ambitious package of support in July,\u201d he said. \u201cOur research lays out a costed plan of what\u2019s needed to improve the lives of the world\u2019s poor. Supporting this plan would send a clear signal that the new UK government will continue to be a global leader in development.\u201d There was a time when the UK was proud to be a \u201cglobal leader\u201d in development, even during the last parliament when the then international development secretary, Andrew Mitchell, insisted that higher aid spending had to be matched by greater aid effectiveness, an entirely laudable objective. The Conservatives, however, are now embarrassed by their record on aid. The increase in DFID\u2019s budget is unpopular with the Tory press. Cameron and Osborne appear to have calculated that there are more votes to be had from potential Ukip supporters who are opposed to Britain spending more on overseas development, than from voters in the centre who are proud the commitment has been met. Even so, they have enshrined the 0.7% target in law, which means they will get no credit for protecting the aid budget while pledging to continue doing so. The next four weeks will reveal whether this is a masterstroke or a tactical blunder. Certainly, highlighting the government\u2019s track record on aid would make the Conservative\u2019s approach to winning the election look positive and less mean-spirited.",

      "body": "<p>Rarely, if ever, has there been a more parochial election. Apart from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/apr/09/from-non-doms-to-trident-a-perilously-off-piste-week-for-the-tories\">the confected row about the renewal of Trident</a>, the two main parties seem curiously indifferent to what is going on beyond Britain\u2019s shores, unless it involves immigration. The assumption is that voters only really care about bread-and-butter domestic issues such as whether they have a job and a roof over their head.</p> <p>Yet it is not so long ago that people took to the streets of Birmingham in 1998 to demand that the G8 countries provided debt relief to the world\u2019s poorest nations. Action followed because it was obvious plenty of voters cared passionately about international development. When the UK next hosted the G8 seven years later, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2005/jun/14/globalisation.development\">the agenda at Gleneagles was dominated by Africa and the looming threat of climate change</a>. The people who took part in the Jubilee 2000 and Make Poverty History campaigns are still there. They haven\u2019t gone away. </p> <p>The calculation, however, is that there are no votes in development - which is why, when the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank meet in Washington later this week, the talks will not impinge on the election campaign. George Osborne and Ed Balls will be looking to see how they can exploit what the IMF says about the health of the UK economy for domestic political reasons, but that\u2019s about it.</p> <p>This is a shame, not least because the next government will be affected by three sets of issues being discussed in Washington this week. One set involves the current state of the global economy: not just the individual hotspots such as Greece and Ukraine, but how and when central banks start to unwind the unprecedented monetary stimulus provided since 2008-09. </p> <p>Another set involves the future of the so-called Bretton Woods institutions themselves, where <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/asian-infrastructure-investment-bank\">the creation of the Asian Infrastructure and Investment Bank </a>is a direct result of the US refusal to back reforms that would give countries such as China, India and Brazil a bigger say in the running of the World Bank and the IMF. The AIIB is a Beijing initiative and will be a rival to the World Bank, an institution that the UK helped found in 1944 and has strongly backed with a rising aid budget in recent years.</p> <p>The final set of issues involves the development agenda for the next 15 years. In July, world leaders will gather in Addis Ababa to discuss how they will finance development. In September, the same cast will gather in New York to set sustainable goals to be achieved by 2030. The caravan then moves on to Paris in December where leaders will try to forge an agreement on climate change. </p> <p>The meetings are linked. Sustainable development goals will only be achievable if there is money on the table. Developing countries will demand help to deal with the impact of climate change if they are to sign up to tougher emission targets. Jim Kim, the president of the World Bank, was right last week when he said that this was the most important year for global development in living memory.</p> <p>Both the main parties have a good story to tell on international development. It was under Labour that the UK committed to meet the UN target of spending 0.7% of national income on aid. It was under the Conservative-led coalition that the target was finally hit.</p> <p>Only three areas of spending have been spared the cuts the government deemed necessary to repair the hole in the public finances left by the recession: the NHS, schools and the Department for International Development.

      "bodyText": "When the last recession struck, the North Devon-based manufacturing company Renatus found its organ-building business was starting to suffer. Salvation came in an unlikely form \u2013 a machine sitting unused in its factory. Now up to 20% of its business comes from orders for precision-cut pieces of simple wooden desks and chairs. The precise plans of the furniture are emailed to the company and then made on a computer-guided machine that etches out shapes from plywood sheets which are then delivered to the customer, usually within a short time frame, and then clicked together. Behind this new take on production is the London-based firm Opendesk whose brief is to overhaul how furniture is manufactured and bought. It connects the designers, who create desks, tables, chairs and stools for offices, with customers anywhere in the world and nearby manufacturers such as Renatus who can cut out the design. By taking the storage facilities, lengthy shipping times and showrooms out of the equation, Opendesk says it can cut out the numerous middlemen and change how furniture is sourced, in what they describe as an attempt to do to firms such as Ikea what Airbnb is doing to the hotel industry. The process begins with a customer selecting a piece of furniture from a database of items made by designers linked with Opendesk. A nearby maker which can cut out the plywood pieces for the design is sourced and the item goes into production. The items are made using computer numerical control machining in which computers control the cutting tools. When completed, the boards can be transported flatpacked and erected by clicking together the legs, sides and tops of the furniture, each of which are designed to not need metal parts. Joni Steiner, one of the five co-founders at Opendesk, which was established in 2013, said they took a guiding principle from economist John Maynard Keynes, who said: \u201cIt is easier to ship recipes than cakes and biscuits.\u201d One of the first jobs for the start-up was an order for a desk in New York which they then linked to a local company that they had not worked with before. \u201cYou have these designers who have these digital designs, you have the makers who have access to the tooling, and then you have an online platform which connects them and provides a retail point for people to place an order from someone local. That is where Opendesk sits, in the middle of that process,\u201d said Nick Ierodiaconou, another co-founder. \u201cWhat we are able to do is give a consistent level of information for people wherever they are in the world in order to make something that comes out as a makeable quality piece of furniture.\u201d Still in its early days, Opendesk has a database of 200 makers across 32 countries and has designs for about 50 products. One of the designers, Denis Fuzii, published the specifications for a lounge chair, made of six pieces which can be assembled in a minute, from his studio in S\u00e3o Paulo. Fuzii has now reached a worldwide audience, with his designs downloaded more than 5,000 times across 95 countries. \u201cUnlike a traditional channel for a designer where they would have to negotiate big contracts with distributors and retailers in order to get discovered and off the ground, in our minds once you have the internet, there are already so many channels online [where] people can self-publish,\u201d said Ierodiaconou. By changing the way in which the furniture is produced and moved \u2013 without time-consuming and expensive shipping, costly showrooms and storage facilities \u2013 the slice of the cost price which each side earns also changes. Typically, 10% goes to the designer, 60% to the maker and the rest for Opendesk themselves. As the furniture is made on demand, the amount of time it takes to be produced is also reduced. Where this can work against Opendesk is that it doesn\u2019t have a showroom for companies to look at its furniture to kit out their offices. Instead, some of the businesses which have bought from Opendesk allow prospective purchasers to come in and have a look. \u201cDo you need to have a showroom for all of your products? Well, yes, if you are on the high street and you are competing with the shop next door, but no if there are businesses all around your business which have the same furniture that you can just pop in and have a look at,\u201d says Ierodiaconou. One of its trademark four-person desks sells for about \u00a31,400, which the company says is 50% cheaper than a high-design solution and just two to three times higher than the Ikea price. If sold at retail, where there is a typically a 200% mark-up, the designer would receive half of what he would get through Opendesk, says Ierodiaconou. \u201cThe maker would be completely squeezed, there would be a huge amount of shipping plus environmental costs.\u201d Customers who have bought furniture from Opendesk include Greenpeace and actor Steve Coogan\u2019s Baby Cow production company. The focus at the moment is on businesses, such as start-ups, which are growing and need furniture. A move into residential furniture has been mooted for the future. The company deals with orders in the UK and parts of North America at present and connects customers and makers outside of those areas online. Around \u00a3640,000 has been raised so far by Opendesk in crowdfunding, angel investment and grants, with profit forecast for 2017. Opendesk expects to sell \u00a3250,000 worth of products in the first half of 2015. Another of the founders, the CEO Tim Carrigan, used the example of Made.com (the online furniture retailer which cuts out the middleman and allows customers to buy furniture directly from the makers) to demonstrate how people are prepared to change the way they buy furniture. Along with Ierodiaconou, Steiner and Carrigan, the other co-founders of Opendesk are James Arthur and Ian Bennik. Back in Devon, Jeremy Hayden of Renatus says its new system, using the largely unused CNC machine, has given the company a boost. \u201cWithin a year, it has gone from nothing to perhaps 15% to 20% of the turnover,\u201d he says. The desk of the future may not be a fixed piece of wood but have parts which can be chopped and changed as technological advances happen, says co-founder Joni Steiner. Opendesk is looking at ways in which a desk can be upgraded over time to clip on new products, such as wireless phone charging or LEDs which blink when there is a phone message.

      "bodyText": "George Osborne, the arch-tactician, surely has at least one pre-election lollipop up his sleeve for Tuesday\u2019s Tory manifesto launch; but so far in the general election campaign, Labour have made the running on tax. When Ed Miliband announced his party\u2019s pledge to abolish non-domiciled tax statutes, the Conservatives \u2013 unsure whether to attack Labour for destroying a useful quirk of the UK tax system, or condemn the policy as half-hearted \u201ctinkering around the edges\u201d \u2013 became bogged down in arguments about how much revenue abolition would raise. Yet, as the clear public support for the policy in subsequent polls suggested, voters aren\u2019t interested in the niceties of whether it would bring in a few million pounds, a billion, or even nothing: they\u2019re concerned about fairness. And a few days on, looking up from the maelstrom of the campaign, that suggests two wider thoughts. For one thing, the non-doms debate was a reminder of just how much our tax system is silted up with decades\u2019 worth of historic detritus. As Labour took delight in pointing out, the notion of a non-domiciled status for tax purposes was introduced by William Pitt the Younger in 1799. It was an artefact of Britain\u2019s colonial past, which, like curry and our chippiness about the Yanks, had gone largely unquestioned ever since. Labour introduced a charge on non-doms in 2008, but only after Osborne mooted the idea in his 2007 conference speech. Abolishing the privilege had still largely remained the concern of committed tax campaigners, such as the Tax Justice Network, which has highlighted the iniquities of non-dommery for many years. Elsewhere there\u2019s a tendency to resort to the British version of the Gallic shrug: one which says, this is the way we do things; it\u2019s the accretion of hundreds of years of history; let it be (I experienced this phenomenon most recently while watching the flummery of the black-stockinged functionaries in Michael Cockerell\u2019s excellent Inside the Commons series). One of the refreshing things about Miliband\u2019s politics is that he seems willing to ditch this kind of business-as-usual approach where it can, and should be, trumped by fairness. And that\u2019s the second thought which remains after the non-dom shenanigans. Once we start to subject Britain\u2019s tax system to the test of basic fairness \u2013 even plain logic \u2013 there are plenty more arcane accretions that should be swept away. As the Equality Trust said in a report last year, taking the system as a whole, including regressive VAT, as well as income and property taxes, the poorest tenth of households pay 43% of their income in tax, while the top tenth pay 35%. That\u2019s partly because politicians have reached for quick-and-easy VAT changes as a money-raiser in recent years, hoping they are less noticeable than piling a penny on income tax, which shows up in black and white on pay slips. And it\u2019s also because of a more recent historical deposit than anything Pitt ordered. Margaret Thatcher\u2019s deeply regressive poll tax, abandoned in the face of mass public protest, was replaced with a council tax based on 1991 property values. It was never completely proportional, but the intention was for regular revaluations, so that the tax would keep pace with house-price inflation. Yet successive governments wary of upsetting a key demographic \u2013 the comfortable homeowner \u2013 have repeatedly failed to carry out revaluations, despite rocketing prices. As the Institute for Fiscal Studies\u2019 authoritative Mirrlees Review of Britain\u2019s tax system put it, \u201cany revaluation inevitably creates losers and winners \u2013 and losers tend to be very vocal\u201d. It called the failure to revalue council tax bands, \u201cone of the most egregious demonstrations of the \u2018tyranny of the status quo\u2019 as a block to desirable change\u201d. The Equality Trust finds that even with rebates and council tax benefit taken into account, the poorest tenth of households now pay almost 6% of their income in council tax, against 1.39% for the richest tenth. It argues for extra bands for the most valuable properties and a commitment to regular future revaluations. That might be less popular than Labour\u2019s \u201cmansion tax\u201d on \u00a32m-plus properties or Osborne\u2019s recent decision to increase the burden of stamp duty for richer buyers, but it would be much fairer, while increasing the costs of leaving properties standing empty, one of the myriad causes of Britain\u2019s housing crisis. In fact, the Mirrlees Review suggested replacing council tax with a \u201chousing services tax\u201d, directly proportional to a property\u2019s value . Over time, it suggested, its value could be increased so it would completely replace not just council tax, but the notoriously distortionary stamp duty too. And while on the subject of dusty, outdated corners of the tax system that should be looked at again in the light of fairness, national insurance is now a nostalgic relic of a contributory social security system that bears little connection to today\u2019s reality. It\u2019s poorly understood, based on a different definition of earnings to income tax, and has different rates and thresholds, petering out almost completely for the highest-paid. Osborne may yet announce that a Tory government would merge the national insurance and income tax systems, a change he first mooted back in 2011 and which has repeatedly been rumoured as a runner for the Tory manifesto. That would be a sensible move which would give taxpayers a clearer idea of their total financial contribution. And that\u2019s the real challenge to iniquities such as continued existence of non-dom status. You can read public enthusiasm for abolishing it as the politics of envy, a desire to bring the super-rich down a peg or two. But there\u2019s also a sense that not paying tax means you\u2019re a taker, not a giver; semi-detached, not a real member of society. Politicians tend to couch tax promises to the electorate as if some distinct and unsympathetic group \u2013 mansion-owners; super-rich foreigners; City bankers \u2013 will pay the price of nursing the sick and educating our kids. In fact, it\u2019s down to all of us. And the more taxation is clear, simple and fair \u2013 the mark of a civilised society, instead of an optional extra the rich can skip out off \u2013 the more loudly that argument can be made.",

You may not quite get the difference between the two, but don\u2019t worry. This week might provide you with the chance to enrol in one of those crash courses in the dismal sciences that we all adore, as there\u2019s a chance that when the latest inflation data is revealed we will discover that prices have been falling (at least according to the consumer price index measure). In February, Bank of England governor Mark Carney predicted the UK would experience its first bout of negative inflation in more than half a century \u2013 with the last time it retreated being March 1960, according to the closest comparable data from the Office for National Statistics. Still, the Bank expects the slump in oil prices and falling food prices to keep inflation low in the short term, only for lower oil prices to then significantly boost consumer spending, which in turn should fuel growth and push inflation higher over the medium term. Incidentally, the difference between deflation and negative inflation is this. Negative inflation is falling prices over a short period, but over the medium to long term it\u2019s called deflation. Or, on the beach, a slow puncture. Debenhams avoids cuts to prices \u2013 or the boss\u2019s pay There are not many achievements that the City is willing to credit to Debenhams boss Michael Sharp, but there is one that he can surely be proud of. The UK\u2019s (potential) new economic model of falling prices is one lifted right out of the retailer\u2019s chunky playbook of disasters. The department store got itself into all sorts of trouble last year over its constant discounting \u2013 and after it finally grew tired of all the stick, it came up with a plan: fewer discounts, improved online delivery and better product, by introducing concessions from the likes of, er, Sports Direct. Anyway, this year Debenhams avoided a repeat of the sharp profit warning of Christmas 2013, but its trading over the 2014 festive period was still disappointing, and we will find out this week whether it\u2019s making progress when it reports much-anticipated results. Still, while some price-slashing is hard to stop \u2013 the shares are still trading at a large discount to the sector \u2013 Debs has proved that other prices can rise. For example, in the 12 months to August, Sharp enjoyed a 32% rise in his pay, despite the continuing struggles at the department store. Isn\u2019t life grand? WH Smith prospers after Swann\u2019s departure There\u2019s a school of thought that if the price of a bottle of water from WH Smith was used to calculate CPI, we might now be in the realms from hyperinflation. As thirsty airline and train travellers frequently moan, such are the retailer\u2019s prices for H2O, that purchases must be accompanied by a free copy of the Daily Telegraph and a check on your own credit worthiness. Neither tends to be all that welcome. Anyway, the retail chain seems to know what it\u2019s doing, as we may find out again when it reports this week. Following Kate Swann\u2019s lengthy acclaimed spell running a shop, plenty (including this page) feared for her successor, Stephen Clarke, who took over in July 2013. But in what may yet prove to be the only case in recent history of a top retailer resisting the temptation to stitch up their replacement, WH Smith shares are close to doubling since Swann left. All of which is something of a surprise. The rule of thumb in the shopping sector is that when a long-standing and widely lauded chief executive stands down, you sell the shares. But here, loyal WH Smith investors who held on after Swann left have been rewarded \u2013 and are probably now so rich that they can afford to buy a drink from WH Smith.",

      "bodyText": "The world of Big Oil looks set for another round of mega-mergers and acquisitions after Shell set the ball rolling this week with its $70bn agreement to take over BG. All eyes are on ExxonMobil. The world\u2019s largest shareholder-funded energy giant has plenty of cash \u2013 and opportunities, now that the drop in oil prices has produced an army of willing sellers. At one of the company\u2019s rare meetings with Wall Street analysts recently, Exxon executives boasted it had a serious call from investment bankers acting on behalf of distressed oil companies looking for a saviour. Although Brent blend has only recently dived to less than $60 per barrel, from the highs of $115 seen last June, many energy companies are over-extended after a three-year period when they grew fat and over-ambitious, feasting on very high oil prices. Among the most obvious targets would have been Britain\u2019s former flagship oil group, BP. But the reality is that its continuing legal fallout from the Deepwater Horizon accident in the Gulf of Mexico and its deep involvement in the Russian state oil sector has made it a poisonous pill that few predators would want to ingest. But there will be endless speculation now about the future of other European energy companies such as Total of France and ENI of Italy, never mind US groups such as Chevron, ConocoPhillips and Anadarko or the plethora of North Sea minnows. The last round of intense mergers, when Chevron moved on Texaco, Conoco on Phillips and Exxon on Mobil, was triggered by a similar collapse in oil prices at the end of the millennium. It was BP\u2019s then chief executive, John Browne, who set the pace with quick takeovers of first Amoco, followed by Arco and then Castrol. Oil bosses saw the opportunity of mergers that would enable them both to cut costs through removing jobs and offices and increase their oil reserves without the need for costly exploratory drilling. The same factors are in play today, but still it has been quite a turnaround for Ben van Beurden and Shell. The seemingly sober Dutchman succeeded to the top job at the start of last year, promising to slash spending and sell underperforming assets. Barely 12 months later, the Shell lifer has turned into a swashbuckling corporate acquirer, agreeing to take over BG in one of the biggest deals ever seen in the energy sector. There are still regulatory hurdles to overcome and plenty of analysts are alarmed at the price offered: a 50% premium to the share value. Shell has been seen in the past as a slow-footed beast that has missed out on some of the big opportunities: not just the mega-mergers of the late 1990s but also the US shale revolution and huge Brazilian deep-water finds. This time the Anglo-Dutch business has led from the front \u2013 as it seems to be doing in the race for the Arctic, with its determination to press ahead with drilling off Alaska despite widespread concern about the impact on the environment. The takeover of BG can be seen as an opportunity for Shell to bulk up in Brazil; or as a chance to leap to the top of the liquefied natural gas (LNG) market, where BG is predominant; or as a cost-cutting exercise. In fact, it is a bit of everything, and Shell has been linked by the City with the possible acquisition of the former British Gas exploration arm for years. No one had any doubts about the synergies. Luck and timing are as important in business as in sport or other endeavours, and van Beurden had almost six months from the start of last year to begin his original cost-cutting exercise at Shell before oil asset prices slumped. Rivals will base their moves partly on what they think will be the future direction of oil prices. If they think the cost of Brent will bounce back shortly, now is the time to pick up those assets on the cheap. Athens close to the brink A trap door is slowly opening under Athens. The Finns appeared to give it a little nudge last week with a leaked report offering a glimpse of its battle plans should the Greeks exit the euro. In Berlin, the finance minister\u2019s obsession with paying down debts (bizarre when German infrastructure is falling apart) was on display again and gave a further clue that he will not tolerate Greece reneging on its own borrowing. While words like denouement have been used before in reference to the crisis, itreally looks as if we are on the last chapter of a very long book. With only days left to present a plan and not more than two weeks to come up with some serious cash to repaya series of outstanding loans, Athens is at crunch point. After weeks of contradictory statements, finance minister Yanis Varoufakis announced last week the sale of state assets, halted when the leftist-led Syriza government was elected in January, but would resume on different terms. He didn\u2019t say what he would sell, but made the obvious point that there were many things the state owns which will suffer from a chronic lack of investment if left in government hands. Many analysts still doubt a majority of the eurozone countries will let Greece leave the currency bloc. In a small short-term boost, it is understood that the European Central Bank ECB has agreed to increase the ceiling on emergency lending assistance to Greek banks by \u20ac1.2bn to \u20ac73.2bn (\u00a359bn). The ECB is reviewing the limit weekly while eurozone negotiations continue. Yet the exit seems to edge ever wider. Prime minister Alexis Tsipras, elected on a promise to end austerity, is balking at Brussels\u2019s demands to reform the pension system and labour markets \u2013 demands to which his conservative predecessor had agreed. Brussels might relent and push Athens to liberalise other markets as a way to achieve the same end. But window dressing cannot disguise the fact that Greece simply has not got the money to pay its debts and Europe\u2019s big beasts are unwilling to offer more subsidies. Co-op conversion The Co-operative Group\u2019s chief executive, Richard Pennycook, declared last week that Britain\u2019s biggest mutual had come through the worst as it returned to profit after a tumultuous two years. But when Pennycook\u2019s predecessor, Euan Sutherland, complained as he walked out that the Co-op was ungovernable, he hit on problems that have not entirely gone away. There has been reform. The group\u2019s members reluctantly accepted governance changes to get through the crisis caused by the near-collapse of its bank. They agreed to only elect three members of the group\u2019s shrunken board, with the rest appointed from the world of business. But last week members were presented with just three candidates, with little background as co-operators, giving them no choice. Dame Pauline Green, a senior figure in the movement, was told she could not stand. The Co-op prides itself on being different \u2013 ethical and democratic as well as good value for its customer owners. That\u2019s a difficult combination in today\u2019s environment for retail, the group\u2019s biggest business. Yet if that distinctiveness is lost, what\u2019s the point of the Co-op?",
