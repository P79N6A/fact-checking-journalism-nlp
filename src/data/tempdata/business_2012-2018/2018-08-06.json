Despite some disappointment with the latest Weight Watchers results, the company is still far above the record low of $3.75 it reached in July 2015 when Winfrey acquired 6.4m shares and signed on to a five-year deal to be the face of the firm. By October that year, Winfrey\u2019s five-year deal had already netted her $50m in share appreciation. WTW\u2019s shares are up 170% over the past year.",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s hot summer has masked the weakness of consumer demand by prompting the sharpest monthly growth in food spending in five years, the latest snapshot of the high street has shown. The British Retail Consortium (BRC) said the main beneficiaries of the long, dry spell were supermarkets and pubs as well as shops selling fans and other cooling equipment, but that other parts of the sector suffered. Food retailers reported their best sales for July in five years as households prepared for barbecues and picnics but the extra spending came at the expense of stores selling goods for the home. The BRC said that in the three months to July, food sales were up by 4.5% while non-food sales declined by 1.2%. Helen Dickinson, the BRC\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cLast month\u2019s sweltering temperatures kept shoppers focused on eating, drinking and keeping cool. Food sales had their best July in five years, while fans and cooling equipment flew off the shelves. \u201cHowever, total sales growth slowed as the heat laid bare the underlying weakness in consumer spending. Sales of non-food products struggled. Three months into an extended period of summer weather, demand for many seasonal purchases has slowed while the heat has kept shoppers away from days spent browsing new ranges. For many in the industry, autumn could not come sooner.\u201d Dickinson said traditional high street retailers were suffering from the twin effect of lower consumer footfall and rising business rates. With household budgets squeezed, the past year had led to in-store sales of non-food products falling by 2.5% at a time when business rates increased by almost 3%. \u201cAlthough changing consumer behaviour means we will have fewer shops in future, the reality is that if we want to support a positive reinvention of our high streets, business rates cannot go on increasing.\u201d A separate report from Barclaycard found that the England football team\u2019s better-than-expected performance at the World Cup boosted pub takings. They rose by 73% on the day of the semi-final against Croatia. Barclaycard said spending was up by 5% in July but Esme Harwood, a director at the company, said: \u201cIt will be interesting to see if this strong level of growth continues as we move into the final stretch of summer. It\u2019s clear that some consumers remain cautious about what\u2019s to come, with interest rates rising and overall confidence in household finances down slightly from June.\u201d",

The gimmicky stuff has worked wonders for WeWork. The fashionable US company is supposedly worth $20bn in privately owned form, even though it is loss-making. By contrast, IWG, a quoted UK firm that has been around for 30 years and is substantially larger, makes profits. Yet it cannot land a buyer willing to pay the much smaller sum of \u00a32.8bn-ish. IWG on Monday said it had ended takeover talks with three private equity suitors, meaning it has had unsuccessful negotiations with six would-be bidders in short order. \u201cNone of the interested parties is currently capable of delivering an executable transaction at a recommendable price,\u201d IWG said. Its shares fell 20%. Mark Dixon, the founder and 25% owner of IWG, naturally did not say what a \u201crecommendable\u201d price might be. But if he has been distracted by the mania around WeWork, he should let go. The valuation of the US company is bizarre and surely could not be sustained on the public markets. Harder-headed investors would want more than WeWork\u2019s boasts about how it is reinventing workplaces as \u201cdynamic environments for creativity, focus and connection\u201d. In the end, it is in the humdrum business of providing short-term office space on flexible terms. That\u2019s also IWG\u2019s market. The fact that no would-be bidder has been prepared to pay a silly takeover price should send a message across the Atlantic. Yes, IWG is suffering a few headaches in the UK and pre-tax profits fell by a third to \u00a354.3m at the half-year stage. But, on any normal measure, it should still be worth more than WeWork. The moral of the non-bids for IWG is surely that the sceptics are right and that WeWork is overvalued. New York challenge should be on UK radar The chancellor, Philip Hammond, reports the FT, has privately told City bosses to expect a French assault on the UK\u2019s financial services industry after Brexit. UK bank bosses had reached roughly the same conclusion themselves. First, bankers say the contrast is stark between German and French appetites to grab some of the City\u2019s business. German politicians simply aren\u2019t interested. Deutsche Bank is regarded as a national embarrassment and its troubles have deadened any desire to house international investment banks in Frankfurt. By contrast, the French establishment, even before the arrival of President Macron, is affronted that French banks such as Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale have placed their main trading floors in London. Hammond\u2019s reported worry that regulation will be used by France to force business out of London is also familiar. Paris fought fiercely to become the new home of the European Banking Authority and got its wish. It may see a chance to rewrite rules that it regards as having been written in London to favour the home team. In other words, Hammond\u2019s analysis of the French threat to the City will not be controversial. But it would be more enlightening to hear his plan for tackling the parallel risk that Brexit-inspired upsets will allow New York to collect business from London, the traditional rival. Most UK bankers take the view that Wall Street represents the real danger, especially for financial activity that could take place anywhere in the world. UK politicians barely bother to talk about the New York challenge. They should. Hungry Wall Street banks are just as formidable as French administrators \u2013 probably more so. Premature for JLIF to run for the hills The board of John Laing Infrastructure Fund is terribly pleased with itself for agreeing a takeover bid at 142.5p a share, or \u00a31.4bn. The price is \u201can attractive premium to the undisturbed share price,\u201d says the chairman, David MacLellan. Well, yes, that\u2019s true in the sense that the offer is pitched at almost 24% above the share price before the joint bidders, Dalmore Capital and Equitix Investment Management, came calling last month. Come on, though, there are other ways to judge value. JLIF\u2019s shares stood at 139p last September and City analysts estimate that the true net asset value \u2013 a key number for infrastructure funds \u2013 is about 130p. Viewed through those lenses, the takeover premium is miserable. JLIF\u2019s board seems scared stiff of Labour\u2019s plans to nationalise PFI assets, which compromise a large chunk of the portfolio. But the shadow chancellor John McDonnell\u2019s ambitions are understandably vague at this stage, so it\u2019s surely premature for JLIF to run for the hills. Some shareholders are reportedly unhappy with the lowball bid. You can\u2019t blame them. Their board has surrendered meekly.",

But it would be more enlightening to hear his plan for tackling the parallel risk that Brexit-inspired upsets will allow New York to collect business from London, the traditional rival. Most UK bankers take the view that Wall Street represents the real danger, especially for financial activity that could take place anywhere in the world.</p> <p>UK politicians barely bother to talk about the New York challenge. They should. Hungry Wall Street banks are just as formidable as French administrators \u2013 probably more so.</p> <h2>Premature for JLIF to run for the hills</h2> <p>The board of John Laing Infrastructure Fund is terribly pleased with itself for agreeing a takeover bid at 142.5p a share, or \u00a31.4bn. The price is \u201can attractive premium to the undisturbed share price,\u201d says the chairman, David MacLellan.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Guardian business email sign-up\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for\u00a0Business\u00a0Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Well, yes, that\u2019s true in the sense that the offer is pitched at almost 24% above the share price before the joint bidders, Dalmore Capital and Equitix Investment Management, came calling last month. Come on, though, there are other ways to judge value. JLIF\u2019s shares stood at 139p last September and City analysts estimate that the true net asset value \u2013 a key number for infrastructure funds \u2013 is about 130p. Viewed through those lenses, the takeover premium is miserable.</p> <p>JLIF\u2019s board seems scared stiff of Labour\u2019s plans to nationalise PFI assets, which compromise a large chunk of the portfolio. But the shadow chancellor John McDonnell\u2019s ambitions are understandably vague at this stage, so it\u2019s surely premature for JLIF to run for the hills. Some shareholders are reportedly unhappy with the lowball bid. You can\u2019t blame them. Their board has surrendered meekly.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The retail trade data released last week was just the latest disappointment in the search for positive signs of household spending. While the figures showed some slightly better signs, overall they merely confirmed that households have shut their wallets as the lack of real wage growth continues. One of the things about underperforming sectors of the economy is how quickly previously weak figures are treated as good signs. The latest retail trade figures released by the Bureau of Statistics showed that in trend terms retail spending in June was 3.1% above where it was 12 months earlier. This was the first time for a year that the annual growth was above 3% and well above the nadir of 1.8% growth in October last year. So yes, good news. But come on, let\u2019s not get too excited. Three per cent spending growth is bloody awful on an historical basis: One of the factors with retail trade data we need to consider is inflation. While most economic data we look at in the GDP figures is in real terms, retail trade figures are nominal \u2013 ie they count the actual dollars spent. This means that they are affected by the current low level of inflation. And while the cost of some of the more essential items of household expenditure are rising above inflation levels, generally that is not the case with the things we buy in retail shops. The closest to the 2.1% CPI rise is in the food categories \u2013 both the general \u201cfood\u201d group and the cafe, restaurants and take-away group. Overall, however, the price of retail trade goods and services rose just 0.2% in the past 12 months \u2013 mostly due to large falls in the cost of items in the household goods group (-2.9%), the clothing and footwear group (-2.3%) and the cost of goods in departments stores (-3%). What this means is that a large proportion of the growth in retail spending has been on food. This is not unusual given we spend about 40% of monthly retail spending on food, but in the past 12 months food spending accounted for 54% of the growth: The only group where we seem to have taken advantage of the fall in prices and spent more than normal was on clothing and footwear. All other groups saw a smaller increase in spending than you would expect given how much we normally spend on them each month. So, to an extent, you can understand why the growth of retail trade is so low. If the price of items was growing at 3%, then even if we all just bought the same amount of goods as we did a year ago, the retail trade would have grown by 3%. With the price of goods barely increasing it means any growth in retail trade has to come from an increase in the amount of things we buy, not from things costing more. The good thing about the latest retail trade data is that it also gives us the latest quarterly figures for volume of trade \u2013 ie growth that takes into account inflation. But these figures show that the low level of retail trade is not due to just weak inflation, but also because households are not increasing their spending anywhere near the level they used to. In the past 12 months, the volume of retail trade grew by 2.5% \u2013 a level it has been stuck at for a year now: The annual growth of 2.5% is also pretty much bang on the average since the GFC hit in 2008, but it remains well below the 4.1% average growth from 1984 to 2008. And this does not bode well for household consumption boosting the GDP figures out next month. While retail trade is not a perfect match for household consumption it is a pretty good guide. The flatness of retail trade volume also means that any lift from household consumption will need to come from areas such as insurance, health, rent and utilities spending: There is not likely to be any lift from the other major non-retail area of new car purchases. The latest new car sales figures also out last week via the federal chamber of automotive industries (the ABS no longer calculate vehicle sales figures) showed that over the past 12 months new car sales fell 7.8%. It is just more evidence that despite pretty solid employment growth figures the lack of income growth remains a major factor for Australian households. We\u2019re not really taking advantage of low inflation to spend more because even with that low inflation our incomes are barely keeping pace (and for many not) with rises in the cost of living. As such we\u2019re spending more on essentials such as food, and holding off on making a major new purchase like a new car. It highlights how, more than ever \u2013 both in political and economic terms \u2013 the major issue is wages growth. Until our wages start growing at a faster pace, we will remain stuck with economic growth much lower than we were once used to. Greg Jericho is a Guardian Australia columnist",

      "bodyText": "The Insolvency Service is to start interviewing former directors of the collapsed government contractor Carillion as it steps up an investigation into one of the biggest corporate failures in recent British history. Nearly seven months after Carillion entered liquidation, the government agency said it had finished transferring 278 contracts to new suppliers as part of a painstaking process designed to ensure smooth continuity of public services. Officials are now expected to devote more time to an investigation into why the company failed, including a closer examination of the role played by former directors, who were branded \u201cdelusional\u201d by MPs earlier this year. The service has the power to disqualify people from serving as company directors for up to 15 years if it finds them guilty of misconduct and can pass information to criminal enforcement bodies in the most serious cases. Earlier this year, the business secretary, Greg Clark, called on the government agency, which has 1,700 staff, to fast-track its investigation. But while officials are understood to have been in contact with directors, who were accused of \u201crecklessness, hubris and greed\u201d in a report by MPs, they are yet to be interviewed. The government\u2019s official receiver, Dave Chapman, is expected to start the interview process in the coming weeks following the completion of the transfer of public and private sector contracts. In a statement, the Insolvency Service said Chapman had \u201cwide-ranging powers to obtain information, material and explanations\u201d. The inquiry will run alongside two parallel investigations into Carillion\u2019s failure, which is likely to cost the government at least \u00a3150m due to the expense of hiring a team from the accountancy company PricewaterhouseCoopers to help manage its liquidation. The Financial Conduct Authority is looking into allegations of insider trading, while the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) is examining the role played by its auditor, KPMG, and the former finance directors Zafar Khan and Richard Adam. The Insolvency Service is turning its attention to the directors after completing the \u201ctrading phase\u201d of the liquidation, which involved finding new companies to take on contracts for public services such as cleaning hospitals, serving school dinners, and road and rail projects. A further 429 jobs have been rescued, taking the number saved since Carillion\u2019s collapse to 13,945 \u2013 more than three-quarters of the company\u2019s pre-liquidation workforce. The number of redundancies has reached 2,787, while 1,272 have retired or found work elsewhere, the Insolvency Service said. A further 240, mainly in Carillion\u2019s former head office in Wolverhampton, have been retained by the Insolvency Service to help wind down its remaining activities. Chapman said: \u201cCarillion is the largest ever trading liquidation in the UK. \u201cThe continued uninterrupted delivery of essential public service since the company\u2019s collapse in January reflects the significant effort put in by its employees, supported by my team and those employed by the special managers [PwC].\u201d He said the Insolvency Service was still overseeing the transition of \u201climited\u201d services to some suppliers and would also work with suppliers who have continued to provide goods and services during the liquidation to make sure they get paid. \u201cMy investigation into the cause of the company\u2019s failure, including the conduct of its directors, is also under way,\u201d he said. Carillion\u2019s failure in January led to widespread recriminations, with former directors, regulators and the government all facing criticism over a company that managed huge construction projects and provided government services. A 100-page report published in May by two select committees found directors prioritised senior executive bonus payouts and dividends for shareholders, even as the company neared collapse, while treating pension payments as a \u201cwaste of money\u201d. They also criticised the leadership and regulatory oversight of the FRC and the Pensions Regulator, whose chief executive, Lesley Titcomb, announced she was stepping down weeks after the report. The public accounts select committee found the government was too slow to react to developing financial problems at a key contractor. While public services have now been transferred to new suppliers, work remains on hold at two major hospital projects in Liverpool and Birmingham, for which Carillion was the main contractor.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Indra Nooyi, one of the world\u2019s most high-profile female chief executives, is stepping down from the top job at PepsiCo after 12 years. During more than a decade running the US company, Nooyi, regularly named in lists of the most influential women in business, sought to respond to shifting consumer tastes by adjusting the focus of the firm from sugary soft drinks and snacks toward healthier fare. She was only the fifth chief executive in the group\u2019s 41-year history and will remain as chairman until early next year. She will be succeeded by Ramon Laguarta, a 22-year veteran of the company who previously oversaw global operations, corporate strategy and public policy and government affairs, and had spearheaded PepsiCo\u2019s expansion in sub-Saharan Africa. The 64-year-old Nooyi has been with PepsiCo for 24 years, and is a leading figure in an elite but diminishing group of high-profile female chief executives at Fortune 500 companies. \u201cGrowing up in India, I never imagined I\u2019d have the opportunity to lead such an extraordinary company,\u201d Nooyi said in a statement. \u201cPepsiCo today is in a strong position for continued growth with its brightest days still ahead.\u201d Nooyi, who is said to get up at 4am, was born in Madras, now Chennai, and left India at the age of 23 to study at Yale, where she earned her master\u2019s degree in public and private management. She went on to work for Boston Consulting and later Motorola, where she became director of corporate strategy and planning. She joined PepsiCo in 1994. Often choosing to wear the traditional sari at corporate events, Nooyi has often expressed pride in her Indian background, attributing her success to a tough upbringing by her parents and grandfather, who insisted that she always come in the top three in her class at school. \u201cAlthough I\u2019m a daughter of India, I\u2019m an American businesswoman,\u201d she once said. Nooyi\u2019s departure leaves just 22 women as chief executives of Fortune 500 companies, a drop from 32 in 2016. Others who have left their jobs recently include Denise Morrison at Campbell Soup, Margo Georgiadis at the toy company Mattel, Sheri McCoy at Avon, Irene Rosenfeld at Mondelez and Meg Whitman at Hewlett-Packard. However, there are still twice as many women leading Fortune 500 companies as when Nooyi took over at PepsiCo in 2006. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing the first women to break the glass ceiling reach the age of retirement,\u201d said Betsy Berkhemer-Credaire, author of The Board Game: How Smart Women Become Corporate Directors. \u201cIt\u2019s a very difficult ascent of the patrician mountain, and corporations should be grooming their next tier of executives to include women, so that at least one woman has a chance to move into that senior executive role.\u201d Nooyi helped steer PepsiCo away from a dependence from sugary soft drinks and snacks such as Doritos and toward healthier but less profitable baked chips and water brands like Lifewtr and Bubly. It recently acquired Bare Foods, a maker of baked fruit and vegetable snacks, and was early in the coconut water market with its Naked brand. The proportion of PepsiCo\u2019s revenue coming from healthier food and beverages has risen from 38% in 2006 to 50%. Under Nooyi\u2019s watch, PepsiCo\u2019s revenue grew to $63.5bn, from $35bn in 2006.",

    "webTitle": "EU acts to protect firms from Donald Trump's sanctions against Iran", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The EU has launched an attempt to protect European businesses from Donald Trump\u2019s sanctions against Iran as the US administration voiced its intent to apply maximum pressure on Tehran by vigorously applying its punitive measures. The sanctions came into force at midnight (US east coast time). At the same time, a blocking statute \u2013 last used to protect EU firms from US sanctions against Cuba \u2013 was brought into force in an attempt to insulate firms and keep alive a deal designed to limit the Iranian government\u2019s nuclear aspirations. European firms have been instructed that they should not comply with demands from the White House for them to drop all business with Iran. Those who decide to pull out because of US sanctions will need to be granted authorisation from the European commission, without which they face the risk of being sued by EU member states. A mechanism has also been opened to allow EU businesses affected by the sanctions to sue the US administration in the national courts of member states. Trump announced his intention to hit firms doing business with Iran when he reneged on a deal struck in 2015 designed to help curtail Tehran\u2019s nuclear ambitions in return for limited sanctions relief. A joint statement issued on Monday by the foreign ministers of the EU\u2019s 28 member states, including the UK\u2019s Jeremy Hunt, said there was a \u201cdetermination to protect\u201d the bloc\u2019s economic interests and the nuclear deal, which Brussels, along with China and Russia, continues to support. The statement said: \u201cThe lifting of nuclear-related sanctions is an essential part of the deal; it aims at having a positive impact not only on trade and economic relations with Iran, but most importantly on the lives of the Iranian people. \u201cWe are determined to protect European economic operators engaged in legitimate business with Iran, in accordance with EU law and with UN security council resolution 2231. This is why the European Union\u2019s updated blocking statute enters into force on 7 August to protect EU companies doing legitimate business with Iran from the impact of US extra-territorial sanctions.\u201d Despite the tough public stance, there are concerns about the efficacy of the blocking statute; EU officials admit that companies continuing to invest in Iran are taking a risk. The Trump administration said on Monday it was not particularly concerned by the EU decision and that the US strategy was designed to apply maximum pressure on Tehran. \u201cThis is completely consistent with what the president has done with other less friendly regimes \u2026 to keep the maximum pressure until our goals are achieved,\u201d a senior administration official told reporters. The Trump administration said it was ultimately seeking a new deal that addressed \u201cthe totality of the Iranian threat\u201d, even as Tehran and key US allies have scoffed at the notion of renegotiating the 2015 nuclear accord known as the joint comprehensive plan of action (JCPOA). The Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, praised the EU for its stance and dismissed the sanctions as \u201cpsychological warfare\u201d designed to help Trump\u2019s political allies in the US midterm elections in November. Speaking on state television on Monday, Rouhani also said that Trump\u2019s recent offer to meet him was now meaningless: \u201cThe person who has knifed his rival\u2019s arm \u2026 now says that he wants talks. They should first take out their knife and put it in their pocket.\u201d The controversial decision to withdraw the US from the JCPOA paved the way for the reimposition of sanctions in two stages. The first round comes into force on Tuesday, and the second takes effect on 4 November, 180 days after Trump ended US participation. The transition period was intended to provide companies already doing business with Iran time to wind down their activities. \u201cOur stated policy has not been regime change, it has been to modify the regime\u2019s behavior,\u201d a US official said. Iran\u2019s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, pledged that his country would \u201covercome this period of hardship\u201d, dismissing the new round of sanctions as mainly psychological warfare. Zarif said the fact that sanctions targeted Iran\u2019s ability to purchase passenger planes showed the US contempt for the Iranian population at large. \u201cIf you have [good] relations with people of Iran, then the question is why the first round of sanctions you imposed were targeting planes?\u201d There have been scores of plane crashes in Iran since the 1979 Islamic revolution, resulting in at least 1,985 deaths. Decades of western sanctions have limited the country\u2019s access to spare parts or new planes.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Time for a recap: Brexit fears have dragged the pound down to its lowest level in almost a year. Sterling slid by three quarters of a cent today to hit $1.2920, its lowest point since September 2017, as City traders fretted about the slow pace of Brexit talks. The selloff was blamed on international trade secretary Sir Liam Fox, and his warning that a \u2018no-deal Brexit\u2019 was a 60:40 chance. Fox also attacked the European Commission for being intransigent, declaring. If the theological obsession of the unelected takes priority over the economic wellbeing of the people then it\u2019s a bureaucrats\u2019 Brexit. This latest sign that UK-Brussels negotiations are floundering also sent the pound down against the euro, losing half a eurocent to \u20ac1.119. Theresa May\u2019s spokesman, though, insists that Britain is confident of getting a good deal (which sticking to its fallback position that no deal is better than a bad one). The EC have denied hampering Brexit talks, telling reporters that: \u201cWe are working constructively, day and night, to reach a deal with the United Kingdom and I think this is also reflected in the fact that the next negotiation round is scheduled for 16 and 17 of August.\u201d City analysts are bracing for more volatility in the months ahead, as Britain heads towards Exit Day, 29th March 2019. Analysts at Capital Economics predict that the pound could fall to $1.20, if London can\u2019t agree a deal with Brussels (or rise to $1.40 if the no-deal threat is avoided). Financial markets have also been jolted by a worrying drop in German factory orders. New manufacturing orders shrank by 4% in June, the biggest drop in almost 18 months. Orders from within Germany, across the eurozone, and beyond all fell -- a bad sign for economic prospects. The decline may show that Donald Trump\u2019s imposition of tariffs on China and the EU are damaging the global economy, denting confidence and cutting demand for German goods. Economists warned that the \u201chorrendous\u201d data suggests Europe\u2019s powerhouse economy is weakening. And with trade war fears escalating, the situation could worsen this autumn. This has pulled several European stock markets into the red today, with Germany\u2019s DAX index down 0.3%. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 ended the day flat, though, as the falling pound helped exporters and firms with overseas earnings. That\u2019s probably all for today. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW Boom! Capital Economics have predicted that the pound could slide back to $1.20 if Britain can\u2019t agree a deal with the EU. Even though sterling has already fallen a long way against the dollar, it would probably drop a lot more if fears of a \u201cno deal\u201d materialised, says analyst John Higgins. Higgins warns: After all, investors still seem to be assigning a fairly low probability to this outcome. Unlike in the run-up to the vote for Brexit in June 2016, there has been no surge in the demand for options to protect against a slump in sterling. And in the past few months, it has only fallen a few cents more against the dollar than might have been expected given the shift in UK/US rate expectations. ... The upshot is that we wouldn\u2019t be surprised if, in the event of no deal, the exchange rate plunged towards, or even below, the level of circa $1.20/\u00a3 that it reached in early 2017. Having said that.... Capital Economics\u2019 \u201cbaseline assumption\u201d is that a deal is reached, pushing the pound back to $1.40 by the end of 2018 (from $1.29 today). Over in the eurozone, Greece has received the final tranche of its bailout - as it prepares to exit the programme in a fortnight. But there\u2019s no celebrating in Athens, following the forest fires left a trail of death and destruction east of the capital. Our correspondent HelenaSmith report from the Greek capital As the death toll rose to 94 - prime minister Alexis Tsipras, whiplashed by public discontent over its handling of the fires, accepted the resignation of the head of the country\u2019s civil protection agency this morning. The resignation, which follows the government\u2019s replacement of the heads of the fire and police services last night, has spurred speculation Tsipras will move ahead with a far-reaching reshuffle to boost his two-party coalition\u2019s flagging popularity imminently. Government sources told the Guardian the makeover will take place well in advance of the leftist leader making his annual economic address in Thessaloniki on September 9th. Tsipras says August 21st will mark the beginning of the end of debt-stricken Greece\u2019s arduous nine-year odyssey on the frontline of Europe\u2019s debt crisis. \u201cAt long last we will reclaim our sovereignty,\u201d he told Greeks claiming \u201cpolitical responsibility\u201d for the fires. But as the countdown intensifies and the trauma of the fires intensifies, it feels anything but festive among those in office in Athens amid reports this morning that even the finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos may not be around for too much longer.... Steven Barrow, strategist at South Africa\u2019s Standard Bank, thinks the pound is falling because time is running out to agree a Brexit deal. He warns (via the FT) that the selloff could intensify this autumn. \u201cWe think the timescale is unrealistic and, as this starts to dawn on the market, it could just prove another factor tipping risk assets over the edge in the autumn. Sterling caught a dose of the \u201cBrexit blues\u201d today, says Connor Campbell of financial spread-betting group SpreadEx. He blames Dr Fox\u2019s warning that a no-deal Brexit was a 60:40 shout, on top of Bank of England governor Mark Carney\u2019s concerns. Campbell says: Though the Western markets were almost uniformly in the red, the day\u2019s real loser was the pound. Plunging half a percent against the dollar \u2013 cable is at a fresh 11 month low \u2013 and 0.3% against the euro, sterling was spooked by the apparent increase in likelihood of a \u2018no-deal\u2019 Brexit, with international trade secretary Liam Fox echoing Mark Carney\u2019s claims last week that the chances of the UK leaving the EU without an agreement in place is becoming more and more of a reality. Brexit worries have also pulled the pound down against the euro today. Sterling has dropped below \u20ac1.12 today, a decline of 0.35%. Back in April it was worth almost \u20ac1.16, meaning UK holidaymakers got a little bit more for their money overseas. Polling company ORB has bad news for the government: public support for Theresa May\u2019s handling of the Brexit negotiations has hit a record low. Just 24% of the public approve of the way things are going, they say, things are going well, down from 40% back in April. European stock markets have slipped into the red today. Investors are worrying about the decline in German factory orders in June and the lack of Brexit progress, meaning the FTSE 100 didn\u2019t get its typical boost from the weakening pound. Mihir Kapadia, CEO of Sun Global Investments, says: \u201cEuropean stock markets opened mixed today as the trade dispute between the US and China continues to hang over investors and stocks... There has been an marked escalation in the trade war, with President Trump\u2019s claiming the US was winning the trade dispute.\u201d The drop in the pound has been the main event on a quiet session, says Boris Schlossberg, managing director of FX Strategy BK Asset Management. He writes: \u201cThe biggest story of the day was the continued slide in cable which hit fresh 11 month highs as it dipped below towards $1.2950 support on renewed fears of a hard Brexit.\u201d Schlossberg also warned that the \u201cwaves of uncertainty\u201d buffeting sterling will become choppier as the Brexit deadline approaches. Marketwatch has more details. The latest attacks on Europe from eurosceptic voices such as Liam Fox are pushing the pound down, argues Commerzbank currency strategist Ulrich Leuchtmann. Leuchtmann says: \u201cThe voices forecasting a hard Brexit are becoming increasingly shrill. The FX [foreign exchange] market is slowly beginning to work out that these people might successfully torpedo a constructive solution.\u201d The pound is continuing to drop, and is now down three-quarters of a cent at $1.293. Over in Downing Street, the prime minister\u2019s spokesman has denied that Britain is likely to leave the EU without a deal. He told reporters at the regular lobby briefing that: \u201cWe continue to believe that a deal is the most likely outcome because reaching a good deal is not only in the interests of the UK, it is in the interests of the EU and its 27 members.\u201d But, he also argued that Liam Fox was right to warn that a \u2018no-deal\u2019 Brexit is an option (spooking the pound to an 11-month low) Why a no-deal Brexit worries the City: The pound is hitting new 11-month lows, due to Brexit worries and a general move into the US dollar this morning. UBS Wealth Management has cut its recommendation for clients to go \u2018overweight\u2019 on shares, due to the threat of a trade war. It fears that the dispute will get worse in the months ahead, with \u201cseveral painful rounds of talks and new tariff measures\u201d on the horizon. Caroline Simmons, deputy head of UBS Wealth Management\u2019s UK Investment Office, warns that trade war spats could rumble along for Donald Trump\u2019s entire presidency: \u201cWhile we expect the trade disputes to ultimately be resolved before the world is tipped into another recession, our base case now assumes things will get worse before they get better. \u201cThe benign macroeconomic environment, and strong fundamentals, have emboldened a recent sense of market optimism. But there is a very real danger of overlooking the possibility of the trade situation getting worse, which could have significant impacts, such as supply-chain disruptions, reduced hiring, and lower investment. \u201cTo reflect this risk and take advantage of the recent move higher in equities, we are reducing our overweight in global equities versus high grade bonds.\u201d The drop in German factory orders may indicate that the country\u2019s growth rate is slowing fast, warns Mikael Sarwe of Nordea Markets: Newsflash: The pound has hit its lowest level since last September, amid heightened worries over Brexit. Sterling fell half a cent this morning to $1.2954. That takes it below its mid-July low to the weakest point in 11 months. The selloff came after Britain\u2019s international trade secretary, Dr Liam Fox, warned that a no-deal Brexit was now more likely than not. Fox told the Sunday Times that there was a 60:40 chance that the UK would leave the European Union without an agreement. He accused the Commission of \u201cintransigence\u201d putting EU rules above economic well-being. Last Friday, Bank of England governor Mark Carney warned that a no-deal Brexit was an \u201cuncomfortably high\u201d risk. He was then criticised as being a \u201chigh priest\u201d of Project Fear; presumably Dr Fox will get the same treatment?.... Back in the UK, car sales have crept up in July, despite a drop in demand for diesel cars again. Some 163,898 new cars were registered last month, up 1.2% year-on-year, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders reports. Diesel registrations slumped by nearly 25% compared with July 2017, as the knock-on effect of the emissions scandal lingers. Petrol car sales jumped by 20%, while electric car sales jumped 21% - giving them 6.5% of the market. Ian Plummer, director at Auto Trader, reckons car buyers got some good deals last month: \u201cManufacturers have been racing to clear stock before new regulations on fuel economy and emissions take effect in September, resulting in some great opportunities for consumers.\u201d Reuters reports that the Chinese media turned up the heat on Donald Trump over his trade policies: The overseas edition of the ruling Communist Party\u2019s People\u2019s Daily newspaper singled out U.S. President Donald Trump in an editorial on Monday, saying he was starring in his own \u201cstreet fighter-style deceitful drama of extortion and intimidation\u201d. Fears of a trade war with America hit China\u2019s stock market today. The Shanghai composite index fell by 1.25%, as traders fretted about the threat of tariffs hurting global trade. Last Friday, Beijing announced plans for new taxes on $60bn of America goods, if Washington carries out its threatened 25% tariffs on $200bn of Chinese goods. Such a move, though, might trigger fresh retaliation from Washington. Yesterday, president Donald Trump claimed that his tariffs were working, indicating that he isn\u2019t planning to change his trade policies: Factcheck: the US budget deficit is actually rising sharply, thanks to Trump\u2019s tax cuts, while farmers are getting a $12bn bailout to protect them from the trade dispute with China. The drop in German factory orders was much steeper than expected, says Bloomberg: Orders fell 4 percent from the previous month -- eight times as much as forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists -- and the 0.8 percent drop from a year ago was the first annual decline since July 2016. The size and scale of the drop in German factory orders in June is almost too bad to be true, suggests Marc Ostwald of ADM Investor Services. He writes: The fact that every single category fell - be that domestic, Eurozone &amp; Non-Eurozone or Capital Goods, Consumer Durables or Intermediate Goods - looks to be highly anomalous, in so far as there is rarely ever a month where there is a \u201cparallel shift\u201d down, barring events such as the global financial crisis of 2008. As such, he expects a sharp bounceback in July. Alternatively, today\u2019s data might be revised up. Economist Fred Ducrozet of Pictet Bank points out that \u2018core\u2019 German factory orders also fell in June: The broader picture is that German factory orders have fallen in five of the first six months of 2018, as this chart from the Financial Times show: The FT\u2019s Camilla Hodgson writes that trade tensions are a factor: The data covers a month when the transatlantic trade relations between the US and the European Union were worsening, ahead of a meeting between US President Donald Trump and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker in July. Carsten Brzeski of Dutch bank ING also believes Germany is being buffeted by rising trade tensions. Here\u2019s his take on today\u2019s data: German industrial orders took a severe hit in June, dropping by 4% month-on-month, from [up] 2.6% month-on-month in May. On the year, new orders were down by 0.8%. Even though new orders data are highly volatile, the June report could be a tentative sign of how trade tensions are hitting the German economy. Foreign orders from outside the eurozone dropped by almost 6% MoM. At the same time, domestic orders decreased by 2.8% MoM. With the sharpest drop since January 2017, today\u2019s new orders data do not bode well for German industry going into the second half of the year. Oliver Rakau of Oxford Economics says today\u2019s German factory data is \u201chorrendous\u201d, and a sign that economic uncertainty is dampening demand. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Donald Trump\u2019s trade wars appear to be biting. New data show that German factory orders slumped by 4% in June, the biggest fall in almost 18 months. The decline was driven by weaker overseas demand, with orders from outside the eurozone slumping by 5.9%. Domestic orders dropped by 2.8%, while orders from other euro countries declined by 2.7%. Orders for capital goods and consumer goods were particularly weak, falling 4.7% and 4.5% respectively. This monthly data can be volatile, but such a big decline suggests that the tariffs imposed by America in recent months are hurting global trade. Germany\u2019s Economy Ministry said that industrial orders fell by 1.6% in April to June, and singled out president Trump\u2019s politics, saying: \u201cRegarding the latest development, uncertainty caused by trade policy probably played a role.\u201d Given the size of Germany\u2019s manufacturing base, this data may highlight wider problems building in the world economy...

The provisional settlement over the way HSBC packaged up toxic bonds between 2005 and 2007 is smaller than some of the settlements the DoJ has reached with other banks, such as the $4.9bn penalty for Royal Bank of Scotland and the $2bn settlement with Barclays. The details of the settlement came as HSBC unveiled a 4.6% rise in first-half profits before tax to $10.7bn from $10.2bn, following years of restructuring. Revenues rose 4% to $27.3bn in the six months to June, while costs climbed 7% to $17.5bn as the bank spent more on hiring staff and on digital improvements. Profits in Asia jumped 23% to $9.4bn but in North America profits were almost wiped out by the DoJ settlement. John Flint, the new chief executive who took over from Stuart Gulliver in February, recently set out a three-year plan to invest $15bn-$17bn in new technologies and China. He said: \u201cWe are taking firm steps to deliver the strategy we outlined in June. We are investing to win new customers, increase our market share and lay the foundations for consistent growth in profits and returns.\u201d However, HSBC, which gets nearly 90% of its profits from Asia, admitted it could take a hit from the unfolding trade war between the US and China. Flint said: \u201cIf there is a full-blown trade war, could it impact our business? Of course. But equally, while we recognise the potential threat, we haven\u2019t seen any impact in our business so far.\u201d He added that there had been no meaningful impact on business yet and whether \u201cthe rhetoric turns to reality remains to be seen\u201d. Steve Clayton, manager of the Hargreaves Lansdown Select UK Income Shares fund, said: \u201cThe potential for growth from China and the wider south-east Asian region ought to be good and HSBC has long thrived from financing global trade flows. \u201cBut in a world of tit-for-tat sanctions between the global powers, it could become harder for HSBC to benefit from its deep Asian roots.\u201d",
