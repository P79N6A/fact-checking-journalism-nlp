      "bodyText": "Comcast has moved swiftly to table a \u00a326bn offer to buy Sky, trumping Rupert Murdoch within hours of the media mogul tabling a new \u00a324.5bn offer. Comcast\u2019s \u00a314.75p a share offer followed Murdoch\u2019s new \u00a314 a share offer valuing Sky at \u00a324.5bn. Murdoch moved to up his original bid \u2013 of \u00a310.75p a share \u2013 ahead of the culture secretary, Jeremy Wright, finally clearing the bid on Thursday. Murdoch is aiming to takeover the 61% of Sky he doesn\u2019t already own through 21st Century Fox, which owns assets including the Hollywood studio behind films including X-Men and Deadpool. Comcast\u2019s first \u00a312.50 a share offer, valuing Sky at \u00a322bn, resulted in Sky\u2019s independent committee recommending shareholders reject Murdoch\u2019s original \u00a310.75 deal tabled in December 2016. His new offer made on Wednesday, at \u00a314.00 a share, once again won over Sky\u2019s independent directors who recommended the new \u00a324.5bn deal. However, Comcast\u2019s new offer, more than 5% over Murdoch\u2019s latest deal, has won the recommendation of Sky\u2019s independent committee. \u201cWe are please to be announcing a recommended increased offer for Sky today,\u201d said Brian Roberts, chief executive of Comcast. \u201cWe have long admired Sky, which we believe is an outstanding company and a great fit with Comcast. We will be posting our offer document to Sky shareholders shortly.\u201d Martin Gilbert, deputy chairman of Sky, said that Comcast\u2019s offer represent an \u201cattractive premium to the current alternative offer\u201d. \u201cWe have long recognised the unique position that Sky occupies,\u201d said Gilbert. \u201cAnd unanimously recommend this offer by Comcast.",

      "bodyText": "The UK is, President Trump kindly informs us, in turmoil. In Westminster, there is feverish talk of a leadership challenge. The economy is in a state of peak Brexit uncertainty. The trade deficit has worsened yet again. An increasingly bitter trade war is battering Britain\u2019s FTSE-quoted commodity giants. In the past, sterling, as the barometer of the nation\u2019s international standing, would have collapsed in value in such a crisis. Yet for the last year the pound-euro rate has never been more stable. On 11 July 2017, the foreign exchange markets gave you precisely \u20ac1.13116 for each \u00a31. One year on \u2013 on Wednesday at just after 10am \u2013 the pound was trading at ... \u20ac1.13116. After a year of catastrophic Brexit negotiations and a UK economy that has slowed to a crawl compared to its neighbours, sterling is in exactly the same place. There was a wobble in August 2017, but since last September, sterling/euro has been held in a virtual straitjacket. It has traded almost constantly in the narrow range of \u20ac1.12 and \u20ac1.14, exhibiting less volatility than at almost any time over the past decade. City scribblers have a habit of focusing on the sterling-dollar rate but in truth sterling-euro is more important; most of our trade is in euros, and so is most of our holiday spending. It\u2019s just that multinationals present their results in dollars, and commodity markets price in dollars, so the financial pages follow suit. Why has the UK\u2019s most important exchange rate stayed so remarkably stable? One view is that currency markets have convinced themselves a hard Brexit is simply not going to happen and that a deal will be thrashed out. Maybe they are comforted by the EU negotiator Michel Barnier\u2019s surprise statement that we\u2019re already 80% there. If so, it would be a rare display of insouciance among FX traders better known for their animal instincts. Long periods during which sterling is becalmed tend to end like summer heatwaves \u2013 with a thunderous tempest before the air clears again. Last week UBS Wealth Management was so confident that sterling is in the danger zone that it issued a press release to say it was opening a short position on the pound. It reckons that UK economic activity lacks the muscle to trigger a Bank of England rate hike in August, and that the eurozone should bounce back from a soft patch while we sit under a Brexit-related cloud. Maybe so. But the euro is also weighed down by the vulnerability of German manufacturing exports in a trade war, and the European Central Bank\u2019s continuing quantitative easing programme, which has the effect of depressing the currency. The unexpected robustness of sterling over the past year amid one political crisis after another may be testament to an underlying strength. On a purchasing power parity basis sterling is probably mildly undervalued against most locations in Europe outside of Spain. It may indeed lurch down if a hard Brexit emerges. But if a deal of some sort is finally signed, prepare for a Brexit bounce in the currency \u2013 and a hurried unwinding of short positions. Ryanair strike Ryanair\u2019s operations from Stansted are far bigger than those from Dublin, and Italy is now a more important market than Ireland. But Dublin, the airline\u2019s global base, retains a compelling hold over the company \u2013 and that is why a \u201clocal\u201d strike by Dublin-based pilots on Thursday could be a pivotal moment. The 24-hour strike won the support of 99% of Dublin-based pilots who voted in a ballot for industrial action. More one-day strikes are planned. In past disputes, the airline\u2019s buccaneering boss would face down strikers, declaring that most flights would still run on time. And most did. This time it\u2019s different: the airline has chosen to cancel scores of flights in anticipation that the once easily browbeaten pilots really won\u2019t show up. Slowly, but perceptibly, the balance of power is shifting. Ryanair is likely to be forced into real, and costly, negotiations with unionised employees no longer willing to accept the jolly japery of its chief executive, Michael O\u2019Leary. Will shareholders follow suit? They have a right to feel impatient; Ryanair\u2019s share price has dropped from \u20ac18.59 to \u20ac15.10 over the past year, a fall of 19%, while easyJet\u2019s has jumped by 12% over the same period. But while some regard O\u2019Leary as a rascal, many others recognise him as the godfather of cheap travel \u2013 and the man who made airlines a properly investable business. He\u2019s still only 57, with no obvious successor. His big problem is that Ryanair, to get through its severe turbulence, needs to show a bit of humility and emollience, and throw a fair wodge of cash towards its overpressed workers.",

      "bodyText": "Global investors have been rattled after a threat by the Trump administration to impose 10% duties on $200bn (\u00a3151bn) of imports prompted protests from Beijing and brought an all-out trade war a step closer. Stock markets headed lower in the US, Asia and Europe on Wednesday as the US warned that it would press ahead with further tariffs and China promised to \u201cfight back as usual\u201d with \u201cfirm and forceful measures\u201d if they were enacted. The FTSE 100 finished the day 100 points lower at 7,591, down 1.3%, while the Dax slipped 1.5% in Germany and the Dow Jones dropped 180 points, or 0.7%, in early trading. The Shanghai stock market hit 2,777, down 1.8% on the previous day and about 25% on the year so far. The US administration released a wide-ranging list of Chinese goods that could be hit by new tariffs after a two-month consultation, including hundreds of food products as well as tobacco, coal, chemicals and tyres, pet food, and consumer electronics including television components. Some of the more eccentric items on the list included frog legs and anvils. The US-China trade spat started in earnest last week after the US formally implemented $34bn worth of tariffs on Chinese goods, including boats, aircraft engines and nuclear reactors. Beijing retaliated with countermeasures of a similar value that targeted soybeans, tobacco and cars. \u201cFor over a year, the Trump administration has patiently urged China to stop its unfair practices, open its market, and engage in true market competition,\u201d said the US trade representative, Robert Lighthizer. Referring to the Chinese retaliation on Friday, he added: \u201cRather than address our legitimate concerns, China has begun to retaliate against US products \u2026 There is no justification for such action.\u201d On Wednesday, China responded to the further threat of tariffs, which would be on top of two other rounds of levies, by saying \u201cirrational US actions\u201d were hurting the world as well as the US. Officials said China would seek support from the international community to resist \u201ctrade hegemony\u201d. China\u2019s ministry of commerce said: \u201cChina is shocked by US\u2019s behaviour. In order to safeguard the core interests of the country and the people, China will have to fight back as usual.\u201d Li Chenggang, an assistant minister at the ministry, said at a forum in Beijing that the latest US proposals interfered with the globalisation of the world economy and that China\u2019s support for a multilateral trade system would not change. China has repeatedly said it is more prepared for a trade war than the US. An English-language editorial in the state-run China Daily said: \u201cIf Trump launches an all-out trade war, the US economy and society may not be able to withstand the impact of countermeasures from China and other economies.\u201d Chinese investors and companies have been worried about a trade war between the world\u2019s two largest economies. Before the tariffs implemented last week, the Shanghai Composite had fallen to a two-year low. China exports aabout $500bn worth of goods to the US a year while it imports about $130bn worth of US goods, giving the US more leverage in the strict confines of a battle over the costs of traded goods. Ma Jun, a former chief economist at China\u2019s central bank, told the Xinhua news agency: \u201cThere are still all kinds of uncertainty over whether the tariffs will be imposed and on what products.\u201d Donald Trump has said he may ultimately impose tariffs on more than $500bn worth of Chinese goods. There are no signs of talks between the two sides. Some US business groups and senior lawmakers criticised the latest action, with the Republican chair of the Senate finance committee, Orrin Hatch, saying it \u201cappears reckless and is not a targeted approach\u201d. The US Chamber of Commerce, which has supported Trump\u2019s tax cuts and efforts to reduce regulation of businesses, also criticised the administration\u2019s move. \u201cTariffs are taxes, plain and simple. Imposing taxes on another $200bn worth of products will raise the costs of everyday goods for American families, farmers, ranchers, workers, and job creators. It will also result in retaliatory tariffs, further hurting American workers,\u201d a spokeswoman said. The Retail Industry Leaders Association, a lobby group representing the largest US retailers, said: \u201cThe president has broken his promise to bring maximum pain on China, minimum pain on consumers.\u201d Hun Quach, the head of international trade policy for the group, said: \u201cAmerican families are the ones being punished. Consumers, businesses and the American jobs dependent on trade are left in the crosshairs of an escalating global trade war.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "News that the Trump administration has threatened to slap tariffs on another $200bn of imports from China has sent a shudder through global stock markets, which were beginning to take a lack of developments on the trade war front as a positive sign. With China expected to respond - but uncertainty over how it will do so - investors decided it was a day to sell out. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished 100.08 points or 1.3% lower at 7591.96 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 1.53% to 12,417.13 France\u2019s Cac closed 1.48% down at 5353.93 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 1.58% to 21,708.06 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended off 1.57% 9733.6 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 174 points or 0.7%. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow, barring any major new developments later. China\u2019s response to Trump\u2019s latest tariff threat could hit the US stock market even hard, especially if it targets American companies operating in China, says Oliver Jones at Capital Economics: Chinese equities were amongst the worst performers today, with the Shanghai Composite dropping 1.8% after the US Trade Representative set out the $200bn of Chinese imports on which it intends to impose a 10% tariff. In contrast, the US S&amp;P 500 has so far fallen by much less. But China\u2019s reaction to the US tariffs could pose a far greater threat to the index in time. China has yet to announce exactly how it will respond to the US announcement. It could implement further tariffs on its goods imports from the US (it matched the duties on $34bn of goods imposed by the US last week). But it would not be able to fully match the scope of the US tariffs, since its goods imports from the US amounted to only $154bn last year. And it might be wary of imposing blanket tariffs, as some of the goods it imports from the US will be difficult to source elsewhere. China can respond by other means, though. It has been suggested that it could deliberately weaken the renminbi \u2013 which fell by more than 0.6% against the dollar today. But while we forecast that the renminbi will fall a little further this year, we doubt that the People\u2019s Bank will tolerate, or engineer, a steep fall in the currency. Our forecast for the end of the year is 6.80/$, compared to 6.67/$ now. Instead, we suspect that China will target US firms operating in China directly...The operations of the majority-owned foreign affiliates (MoFAs) of US multinational enterprises (MNEs) in China dwarf those of their Chinese counterparts in the US, measuring either by sales or employment. And the sales of US MoFAs in China exceeded $350bn in the most recent year for which we have data, which is similar in scale to the US trade deficit in goods with China. So there is considerable scope for China to retaliate by penalising these firms, for example via much more stringent regulatory checks or consumer boycotts. Despite falling today, US equities have generally proved surprisingly resilient to trade worries, while those in China have suffered considerably. But if China were to target US multinationals directly, then this might well change. Heading into the close for European markets, IG\u2019s chief market analyst Chris Beauchamp says the trade tensions have made investors more selective: While stock markets remain in the red in Europe and the US, we are still seeing some buying, taking the likes of the Dow and the Nasdaq firmly off their overnight lows. It feels like we have been stuck in a \u2018trade wars on, trade wars off\u2019 for months now, and last night\u2019s headlines about fresh US taxes on imports from China certainly fitted this game plan. The big question for investors is whether their fear of the damage done by tariffs outweighs their expectations of further global growth. While we have seen the S&amp;P 500 knocked back once again from 2800, it remains within touching distance of this level. Perhaps trade wars are losing their ability to shock, or perhaps investors are more convinced after last week\u2019s minutes that the Fed does have their back if things really do turn ugly. One thing is for certain, and that is that trade wars have made investors more selective about which index to pick \u2013 this afternoon sees a repeat of previous trade war-influenced sessions, as the small cap Russell 2000 outperforms its bigger brethren. US crude stocks fell by a bigger than expected 12.6m barrels last week, the largest drop since September 2016, according to the Energy Information Administration. Analysts had been expecting a fall of 4.5m barrels. Gasoline stocks dropped by 694,000 barrels, compared to forecasts of a 750,000 barrel decline. But with Opec forecasting a fall in demand for its crude next year, down by 760,000 barrels a day to 32.18m, oil prices remained under pressure. Already hit by the prospect of a trade tariff impact, Brent crude is down 2.3% at $76.98 a barrel. Markets are still in the red, but the outlook is really dependent on how China actually responds to the new US threat of tariffs on $200bn of Chinese imports. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: It was one of those days defined by one single, market-shaking event, the kind that actually end up being quite boring because of the rigidity of trading. All that is to say little changed as Wednesday went on, Donald Trump\u2019s threats to $200 million of Chinese imports keeping the markets a state of fear throughout the session. And while the Dow Jones didn\u2019t fall quite as sharply as promised by its futures, the index still plunged 0.6% after the bell, taking it back below 24800 having hit 3 week peak on Tuesday. The day\u2019s losses were actually far worse in Europe. The DAX, perhaps spooked by the sniping between Trump and Angela Merkel, was the worst hit, the German index dropping 1.4%, with the CAC not too far behind with a 1.3% decline. The FTSE, meanwhile, was down 1.1%, just about keep above 7600 having crossed 7700 earlier in the week. While the indices remained resolutely in the red, the forex markets completely flattened out as Wednesday progressed. The dollar, previously in the green as investors looked for a safe haven, shed its growth, reverting back to its starting positions against the pound and the euro. Heading into Thursday and investors will be on high alert for a Chinese response, with any potential Beijing retaliation \u2013 or, equally, a lack of reaction \u2013 likely to be what drives trading in the second half of the week. Commenting on the Canadian rate rise, ING economist James Smith says: As was largely expected, the Bank of Canada resumed its tightening cycle on Wednesday with its first rate hike since January. But the big question going into this meeting was how policymakers would view the recent flare-up in trade tensions. Well, although the statement is littered with references to tariffs \u2013 the word \u201ctrade\u201d appears no less than six times \u2013 the message appears to be one of cautious optimism. Interestingly, it expects the impact of the steel/aluminium tariffs to be \u201cmodest\u201d and still expects growth to average around 2% over the next couple of years. It also remains fairly upbeat about investment, despite trade concerns weighing \u201cin some sectors\u201d. So with most core inflation measures now back around 2%, we suspect the Bank of Canada could strike again later this year \u2013 though it\u2019s clear this is highly contingent on Nafta talks. Negotiations have noticeably stalled over the past month-or-so and it looks like talks could stretch beyond the US mid-term elections in November. This would mean a more prolonged period of uncertainty for Canadian firms. But on the flip-side, as long as the actual trade situation remains unchanged, Canada will continue to reap the rewards of an exceptionally strong US economy. At this stage, we are forecasting another rate hike in the fourth quarter, although any breakdown in Nafta talks, or implementation of further tariffs, could easily change that. Back in the US, and further signs of inflation even before the tariff effect. Producer prices rose by 3.4% year on year, compared to expectations of a 3.2% increase. Bart Hordijk, market analyst at Monex Europe,said: The US Producer Price Index has moved up 3.4% on a 12-month basis, the steepest growth since November 2011, beating expectations for the second month in a row. As the most recent report concerns June, the impacts of the steel and aluminium tariffs that recently came into effect are still hard to discern. Increases in prices for services, for example, contributed the most to the higher than expected price growth, not a rise in prices in goods, as might be expected if companies were hoarding inputs en masse as they await the broadly announced tariffs to come into effect. We know that when producers are forced to switch from cheap foreign inputs to more expensive domestic inputs, or face added tariffs to what they import, that prices paid for inputs are bound to increase. With producer prices already increasing at a multi-year record high pace, tariff induced inflation will only push producer inflation further into record territory. As producers need to pass the higher prices on to consumers, given that lowering margins is not always possible, then consumer prices may receive an extra boost from the side of producers. Today\u2019s PPI numbers thus indicate risks of an upward trajectory for the Consumer Price Index. Over in Canada, the country\u2019s central bank has raised interest rates and warned of more to come. The Bank of Canada lifted its overnight rate target from 1.25% to 1.5%, as analysts had been expecting. It said further gradual rises would be justified, but warned that increasing trade tensions could have a bigger than expected impact on investment and exports: The possibility of more trade protectionism is the most important threat to global prospects. It added: The July projection also incorporates the estimated impact of tariffs on steel and aluminum recently imposed by the United States, as well as the countermeasures enacted by Canada. Although there will be difficult adjustments for some industries and their workers, the effect of these measures on Canadian growth and inflation is expected to be modest. With the escalating trade tensions thanks to the threatened new round of Trump tariffs on $200bn of Chinese imports, it is no surprise that Wall Street has followed other global markets lower. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 140 points or 0.56%. The S&amp;P 500 opened 0.5% lower and the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.78%. Donald Trump may be at the Nato meeting, but he is still preoccupied with tariffs: The escalation of the trade dispute could cause a chain reaction of negative events around the world, says Nigel Green, chief executive of financial advisory group deVere: It is going to lead to higher inflation in the US, as import tariffs raise the cost of imported goods while domestic producers find that they can increase their prices as foreign competition weakens. This means interest rates will be hiked and the dollar will go up. China\u2019s cheap goods have helped keep prices, and therefore US and global inflation, low. To counteract increasing inflation, the US Federal Reserve is even more likely to raise interest rates. A jump in rates will, of course, strengthen the dollar. A stronger dollar also increases stress in emerging markets, many of which have borrowed heavily in recent years in dollars and who now find interest and capital repayments on these loans have shot up in local currency terms. In addition, emerging markets are particularly vulnerable to a downturn in exports resulting from a rise in quotas and import by the US, given that exports are a key driver of growth for many under-developed countries with China the most obvious example. Trump\u2019s trade war is a masterclass in self harm for the US and global economy. China could retaliate against Donald Trump by launching a currency war, and allowing the yuan to weaken, argues Tom Milson, executive director at GWM Investment Management. This would allow China to overcome being unable to impose retaliatory tariffs as it doesn\u2019t import $200bn from the US each year (as explained earlier). Milson explains: The issue China has is that is unable to match the US in the value of imports it applies tariffs to, as the US imports more Chinese goods and services than the Chinese import from the US. China will therefore have to be creative and could retaliate by using its currency to strengthen the value of US dollar, thereby pushing up borrowing costs in the US and making Chinese goods cheaper. It could also put in place measures that will make things difficult for US businesses such as increased regulations. The US stock markets is expected to fall when trading begins, following the losses in Europe and Asia. The Dow Jones industrial average is being called down 170 points, or 0.7%, at 24,750. Artjom Hatsaturjants, research analyst at Accendo Markets, says Wall Street is fretting about Donald Trump (who is currently attending the NATO summit in Brussels). After several days of calm, investors are back worrying about Trump\u2019s latest threat, which would target $200bn of Chinese goods with 10% import duty. This latest effort to \u2018correct\u2019 the Sino-US trade imbalance would take him half-way to his avowed $500bn \u2018nuclear option\u2019, targeting all Chinese exports to the US. His aggressive opener at NATO could also tee us up for a volatile rest of the week in Europe. Economic growth in China and the US would suffer if Donald Trump imposes tariffs on $200bn of Chinese imports, on top of the $34bn of reciprical tariffs already implemented. Louis Kuijs, head of Asia Economics at Oxford Economics, estimates that around 0.25 percentage points could be knocked off China\u2019s growth rate next year, with more damage in 2019. The US would also take a (smaller) hit, Kuijs estimates. Kuijs also warns that \u201cfurther escalation seems unavoidable\u201d, unless Beijing and Washington can negotiate and dial down the situation. It\u2019s possible that criticism from US politicians could persuade Trump to step back, he adde. Obviously, China cannot continue to retaliate with a proportionate response, given that its imports from the US are much lower than its exports to the country. But the new US tariffs are not a done deal either. Although the Trump administration seems quite determined to take further steps, China\u2019s leaders must still hope that low domestic support for a trade war in the US could delay and/or reduce the scale of further actions from the US. Indeed, the latest actions quickly drew criticism at home, including from Orrin Hatch, the Republic chairman of the Senate finance committee. Tomorrow Donald Trump arrives in the UK for a controversial visit that will be marked by protests in London, and a swanky dinner at Blenheim Palace. Some of the great and the good of British business will be there....but it appears entrepreneur Sir Alan Sugar won\u2019t be wielding a fish knife in Woodstock tomorrow. My colleague Rob Davies asked Lord Sugar to check his diary.... It\u2019s not clear whether Sir Alan has nobly declined to meet the US president as a matter of principle, or simply been missed off the guest list altogether. Either way, it means the two hosts of The Apprentice won\u2019t be able to swop anecdotes about boardroom bloodletting. It might be for the best, though. Back in 2012, Sugar and Trump clashed over plans to build wind turbines in Scotland, leading to this unedifying exchange: Perhaps we\u2019d better not let them get too close to sharp implements, and each other... Newsflash: The Chinese yuan is weakening, as anxiety over the trade war builds. The yuan fell through the 6.7 mark against the US dollar in offshore trading, down from 6.65 yuan to the US dollar last night. The 6.7 point is seen as an important psychological point for the yuan against the US dollar -- previously, the People\u2019s Bank of China has intervened to prevent the currency weakening beyond this point. It\u2019s not just badger hair on the list! The FT have spotted that human hair imported from China to the US could soon face a 10% tariff. Live eels, feathers and \u2018beaver heads, tails and paws\u2019 are also among the thousands of products facing new levies. Donald Trump is taking the trade dispute with China to the dangerous point where neither side can back down, argues Bloomberg. They say that the new tariffs on $200bn of Chinese imports outlined overnight could force Beijing to escalate the dispute (it\u2019s either that or a humiliating surrender), which could have dangerous consequences. China has seven weeks to make a deal or dig in and try to outlast the U.S. leader. President Xi Jinping, facing his own political pressures to look tough, has vowed to respond blow-for-blow. He\u2019s already imposed retaliatory duties targeting Trump\u2019s base including Iowa soybeans and Kentucky bourbon. Yet matching the latest U.S. barrage would force China to either levy much higher tariffs or take more disruptive steps like canceling purchase orders, encouraging consumer boycotts and putting up regulatory hurdles. Not only does that risk provoking Trump to follow through on threats to tax virtually all Chinese products, it could unleash nationalist sentiment on both sides that fuels a deeper struggle for geopolitical dominance. \u201cIt\u2019s already past the point of no return,\u201d said Pauline Loong, managing director at research firm Asia-Analytica in Hong Kong. \u201cWhat\u2019s next is not so much a trade war or even a cold war as the dawn of an ice age in relations between China and the United States.\u201d The trade war is coming to American bathrooms. Personal deodorants, antiperspirants, bath salts, shampoos, eye and lip make-up, soap and manicure preparations are all on the new list released by the US Trade Representative last night. So unless America backs down, these products will be around 10% more expensive this autumn. Manure spreaders, shark fins, cod-liver oil, baseball mitts and bicycle speedometers are all also on the list of Chinese goods facing 10% tariffs. So, weirdly, are \u201cfootwear of asbestos\u201d..... David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, sums up the situation: Stock markets in Europe are firmly in the red as President Trump outlined plans to impose a fresh round of tariffs on China. The US president has lined up tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods as a way of showing Beijing he means business. There will be a two month review process, and a hearing in late August. The threat of another round of tariffs has rattled investors, just as market confidence was picking up. China will have to think creatively when it hits back against America\u2019s tariffs. Beijing cannot simply simply slap a reciprocal 10% tariffs on $200bn US goods, because it actually only imported $150bn of goods from America last year. This chart shows: In theory, Beijing could impose a higher tariff, to create the same economic impact. Or it could target the services sector - where America ran a surplus with China. But if China does retaliate again, then Donald Trump could hit back with further tariffs. America imported around $500bn of stuff from China last year - giving Trump another $250bn of ammunition. America could suffer economic damage if these new tariffs are imposed in September, says Cailin Birch, global analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit. He explains: The proposed list of $200bn worth of goods includes a number of industrial inputs and components that would squeeze US companies\u2019 supply chains and ultimately raise consumer prices. And this, at a time when US exporters (particularly of agricultural products and manufactured goods including clothing and machinery) will be suffering from weaker external competitiveness, as a result of the tariffs imposed by China--as well as the by EU, Canada and Mexico, as part of a related dispute. In some areas, China will continue to rely on (now more costly) US imports, including soybeans, which will raise inflationary pressures in China. In others areas, however, China will eventually divert its trade flows and source these goods from elsewhere. Russ Mould, investment director at stock brokers AJ Bell, says investors are scrambling to put their money into safe assets toda: \u201cPlans by the US for an additional $200bn of tariffs on Chinese goods has caused investors to lose their appetite for risk and seek solace in more defensive sectors such as consumer goods and utilities.\u201d European stock markets are not a pretty picture this morning, as trade war worries hit stocks. In London the FTSE 100 is now down by 105 points, or 1.3%. The Stoxx 600, which tracks the biggest companies in Europe, is down 1%. Mining companies are among the top fallers in the City, dragged down by today\u2019s tumble in commodity prices. Trump\u2019s decision to kick off the process of imposing tariffs on $200bn of Chinese goods has clearly hit confidence. Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index, explains: Things were going so well. After four days of straight increases in US stock markets, mainly prompted by the looming earnings season which is expected to show a very respectable growth of about 20% this quarter for the S&amp;P 500, stock markets in Asia, Europe, the US and most of the major commodities were plunged into red this morning, courtesy of the latest US trade tariff decision.... In commodities the board was also almost uniformly red with declines in Brent Crude, gas, precious metals and wheat prices. Worse hit was copper, trading down 3.2% on the day. With China being the single biggest global buyer of base metals, frequently accounting for about half of global trade in the likes of copper, aluminium, nickel and zinc, investors were spooked by the intensifying trade tit-for-tat. Not only will this be negative for China\u2019s demand for metals but will also affect FTSE heavyweights such as Rio Tinto, Glencore and BHP Billiton and a whole host of medium sized and smaller metals producers. America is now conducting a two-month consultation on these proposed tariffs, meaning they could be imposed in September. Paul Donovan of UBS points out that tariffs are actually an additional sales tax, as they make imports more expensive. He says: President Trump once again prepared to lower the yoke of additional taxation onto the shoulders of US consumers. Commodity prices are being hit hard today, with zinc dropping by 6% in Shanghai and copper down around 3.5%. Traders are worried that these new tariffs will dent demand for metals, especially if Chinese growth is hit. The list of Chinese goods facing new 10% tariffs at the US border is long and varied. Thousands of individual products are being targeted. I\u2019ve just speed-read the list, here are some highlights: Meat, such as frozen swine and frogs legs Fish, including live trout, tuna, turbot, Vegetables, such as butter, onions, garlic, fruits and nuts Drinks such as malt beer, orange juice, rice wine Various tobacco products, including cigarettes and cigars Building products such as gypsum and sandstone Commodities including copper, nickel, lead and tin ores Chemicals such as Chlorine, argon, oxygen, barium and mercury Industrial products, such as metals, tires, leather, fabrics, wood and papers. Consumer products such as electric lamps, mattresses, furniture, and camera equipment Electronic kit such as TV components More unusual products on the list include Badger hair for brushmaking Bovine semen Dog and cat food. Antiques at least one hundred years old Postage stamps You can read the full list here Our Beijing correspondent, Lily Kuo, reports that China has heavily criticised America\u2019s move. She writes: In Beijing, Li Chenggang, assistant minister at the ministry, said at a forum in Beijing that the latest US proposals interfered with the globalisation of the world economy and that China\u2019s support for a multilateral trade system would not change. An English-language editorial in the state-run China Daily that has now been taken down said, without mentioning the new tariffs. \u201cChina has no option but to fight fire with fire. It has to resolutely fight back while taking proper measures to help minimise the cost to domestic enterprises and further open up its economy to global investors.\u201d Another editorial in China Daily said, \u201cIf Trump launches an all-out trade war, the US economy and society may not be able to withstand the impact of countermeasures from China and other economies.\u201d More here: Duncan Innes-Ker of the Economist Intelligence Unit points out that America is now targeting low-value manufacturing goods. This could drive production out of China, perhaps to Vietnam and Mexico. America\u2019s new planned tariffs could have a serious impact on China\u2019s factories. China exports around $500bn of goods to the US each year. If these latest tariffs go through, then around half those goods will arrive with additional levies slapped on them. That could hurt demand for Chinese goods in America, creating damage in China and beyond. As Zhu Huani of Mizuho Bank put it: \u201cGiven the magnitude and breadth of the tariff list, the impact is expected to ripple through supply chains and cause collateral damage on regional economies\u201d. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 index has fallen 60 points, or 0.8%, to 7630 in early trading. Other European markets are also in the red, as trade war fears ripple across the trading floors again. The Chinese stock market slumped by over 2% after America announced it was targeting another $200bn of imports. The CSI 300 shed 77 points to 3,390, back towards the 18-month low struck last week. Konstantinos Anthis, head of research at ADSS, says there is shock at Washington\u2019s latest move. This new $200 billion salvo would be a considerable step up in the trade spat between the world\u2019s strongest economies and the odds of this dispute taking a toll on global growth are now mounting. The European and US futures are reflecting investors\u2019 nervousness and the gains seen this week are now under threat Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Global markets are rattled this morning after America escalated the deepening trade war between the two countries. Overnight, Donald Trump began the process of slapping 10% tariffs on a further $200bn of imports from China, on top of the $34bn (soon to be $50bn) imposed last week. The move is a significant escalation of the trade war between Washington and Beijing, further raising the dangers of a major economic shock. US trade representative Robert Lighthizer announced that the US was acting because China had not heeded previous warnings. For more than a year, the Trump administration has patiently urged China to stop its unfair practices, open its market, and engage in true market competition. We have been very clear and detailed regarding the specific changes China should undertake. Unfortunately, China has not changed its behaviour \u2014 behaviour that puts the future of the US economy at risk.\u201d The list of products facing tariffs is long and varied -- everything from vacuum cleaners and TV components to bricks, tires and badger hair for shaving brushes (!) (I\u2019ll pull together a longer list ASAP). The move has been swiftly and heavily criticised by China, which said it was \u201ctotally unacceptable\u201d for America to keep escalating the trade dispute. Investors have also reacted badly, with shares and emerging market currencies falling overnight. The MSCI index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 1.1 %, while Japan\u2019s Nikkei dropped by 1.1%. European stock markets are expected to follow Asia\u2019s lead, as economics warn that a trade war would cause serious economic harm.

In contrast, the US S&amp;P 500 has so far fallen by much less. But China\u2019s reaction to the US tariffs could pose a far greater threat to the index in time.</p> <p>China has yet to announce exactly how it will respond to the US announcement. It could implement further tariffs on its goods imports from the US (it matched the duties on $34bn of goods imposed by the US last week).</p> <p>But it would not be able to fully match the scope of the US tariffs, since its goods imports from the US amounted to only $154bn last year. And it might be wary of imposing blanket tariffs, as some of the goods it imports from the US will be difficult to source elsewhere.</p> <p>China can respond by other means, though. It has been suggested that it could deliberately weaken the renminbi \u2013 which fell by more than 0.6% against the dollar today. But while we forecast that the renminbi will fall a little further this year, we doubt that the People\u2019s Bank will tolerate, or engineer, a steep fall in the currency. Our forecast for the end of the year is 6.80/$, compared to 6.67/$ now.</p> <p>Instead, we suspect that China will target US firms operating in China directly...The operations of the majority-owned foreign affiliates (MoFAs) of US multinational enterprises (MNEs) in China dwarf those of their Chinese counterparts in the US, measuring either by sales or employment. And the sales of US MoFAs in China exceeded $350bn in the most recent year for which we have data, which is similar in scale to the US trade deficit in goods with China. So there is considerable scope for China to retaliate by penalising these firms, for example via much more stringent regulatory checks or consumer boycotts.</p> <p>Despite falling today, US equities have generally proved surprisingly resilient to trade worries, while those in China have suffered considerably. But if China were to target US multinationals directly, then this might well change.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b461cc8e4b0f86cea7477f6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-07-11T15:07:25.838Z\">4.07pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Heading into the close for European markets, IG\u2019s chief market analyst Chris Beauchamp says the trade tensions have made investors more selective:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> While stock markets remain in the red in Europe and the US, we are still seeing some buying, taking the likes of the Dow and the Nasdaq firmly off their overnight lows.

While we have seen the S&amp;P 500 knocked back once again from 2800, it remains within touching distance of this level. Perhaps trade wars are losing their ability to shock, or perhaps investors are more convinced after last week\u2019s minutes that the Fed does have their back if things really do turn ugly.</p> <p>One thing is for certain, and that is that trade wars have made investors more selective about which index to pick \u2013 this afternoon sees a repeat of previous trade war-influenced sessions, as the small cap Russell 2000 outperforms its bigger brethren.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b461944e4b0f86cea747785\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-07-11T14:56:18.757Z\">3.56pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>US crude stocks fell by a bigger than expected 12.6m barrels last week, the largest drop since September 2016, according to the Energy Information Administration.

The DAX, perhaps spooked by the sniping between Trump and Angela Merkel, was the worst hit, the German index dropping 1.4%, with the CAC not too far behind with a 1.3% decline. The FTSE, meanwhile, was down 1.1%, just about keep above 7600 having crossed 7700 earlier in the week. </p> <p>While the indices remained resolutely in the red, the forex markets completely flattened out as Wednesday progressed.

But the big question going into this meeting was how policymakers would view the recent flare-up in trade tensions.</p> <p>Well, although the statement is littered with references to tariffs \u2013 the word \u201ctrade\u201d appears no less than six times \u2013 the message appears to be one of cautious optimism. Interestingly, it expects the impact of the steel/aluminium tariffs to be \u201cmodest\u201d and still expects growth to average around 2% over the next couple of years. It also remains fairly upbeat about investment, despite trade concerns weighing \u201cin some sectors\u201d.</p> <p>So with most core inflation measures now back around 2%, we suspect the Bank of Canada could strike again later this year \u2013 though it\u2019s clear this is highly contingent on Nafta talks. Negotiations have noticeably stalled over the past month-or-so and it looks like talks could stretch beyond the US mid-term elections in November. This would mean a more prolonged period of uncertainty for Canadian firms. But on the flip-side, as long as the actual trade situation remains unchanged, Canada will continue to reap the rewards of an exceptionally strong US economy.</p> <p>At this stage, we are forecasting another rate hike in the fourth quarter, although any breakdown in Nafta talks, or implementation of further tariffs, could easily change that.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b4611e8e4b0f86cea747709\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-07-11T14:21:46.270Z\">3.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Back in the US, and further signs of inflation even before the tariff effect.</p> <p>Producer prices rose by 3.4% year on year, compared to expectations of a 3.2% increase.

Increases in prices for services, for example, contributed the most to the higher than expected price growth, not a rise in prices in goods, as might be expected if companies were hoarding inputs <em>en masse</em> as they await the broadly announced tariffs to come into effect.</p> <p>We know that when producers are forced to switch from cheap foreign inputs to more expensive domestic inputs, or face added tariffs to what they import, that prices paid for inputs are bound to increase. With producer prices already increasing at a multi-year record high pace, tariff induced inflation will only push producer inflation further into record territory. As producers need to pass the higher prices on to consumers, given that lowering margins is not always possible, then consumer prices may receive an extra boost from the side of producers.</p> <p>Today\u2019s PPI numbers thus indicate risks of an upward trajectory for the Consumer Price Index.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b460ec2e4b01745341497e5\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-07-11T14:12:09.612Z\">3.12pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Bank of Canada raises interest rates</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Over in Canada, the country\u2019s central bank has raised interest rates and warned of more to come.</p> <p>The Bank of Canada <a href=\"https://www.bankofcanada.ca/2018/07/fad-press-release-2018-07-11/\">lifted its overnight rate target from 1.25% to 1.5%,</a> as analysts had been expecting.

Tesco warehouse staff earn from about \u00a38.50 an hour, up to more than \u00a311 an hour, while store staff earn about \u00a38 an hour in basic pay, according to the claim. The disparity could mean a full-time distribution worker earning over \u00a35,000 a year more. Paula Lee, one of the lawyers handling the Tesco claims at Leigh Day, said: \u201cWe\u2019ve had an incredible response to the announcement of this legal action. Many proud members of staff have realised that this claim is not anti Tesco, but it is to ensure that the work done in stores and distribution centres is recognised as being of equal value; not the same work, but work of equal value. And that they should be paid the same as their colleagues in distribution. The concept of \u2018women\u2019s work\u2019 is an outdated approach to employment from the middle of the last century which needs to be corrected.\u201d A Tesco spokesperson said: \u201cWe cannot comment on an ongoing legal matter, but we will be defending this claim about equal pay. Tesco has always been a place for people to get on in their careers, regardless of their gender, background or education, and we work hard to make sure all our colleagues are paid fairly and equally for the jobs they do.\u201d The Tesco case follows similar actions against Asda and Sainsbury\u2019s, which are working their way through the employment tribunal process. Nearly 20,000 people are involved in the Asda case, where the latest ruling backed the shop workers\u2019 right to compare their jobs to employees \u2013 mainly men \u2013 working in distribution centres. Asda is due to appeal against that ruling at the court of appeal in October. About 1,000 workers are involved in the Sainsbury\u2019s action.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Rupert Murdoch has upped his offer for Sky to \u00a324.5bn, trumping the offer tabled by rival Comcast and intensifying the bidding war for the broadcaster. The bid worth \u00a314 per share means Murdoch\u2019s 21st Century Fox will have to pay \u00a314.7bn for the 61% of Sky it does not already own. The bid is a significant increase on the \u00a312.50 a share, or \u00a322bn valuation, offer made by its rival Comcast. Comcast must post its offer document to shareholders. It resulted in Sky\u2019s independent directors withdrawing their recommendation to shareholders to accept Murdoch\u2019s first \u00a310.75 offer, to Sky shareholders by Friday. Murdoch\u2019s all-cash bid, which is 30% higher than his original offer and a 12% premium on Comcast\u2019s deal, has been recommended to shareholders by Sky\u2019s independent committee. In light of Murdoch\u2019s new bid, Comcast is likely to counter with a new bid this week for Sky, which has assets including Premier League football rights and a production arm responsible for shows such as the dramas Riviera and Patrick Melrose, starring Benedict Cumberbatch. Murdoch has felt emboldened to forge ahead with a new offer as he is finally set to be given clearance by the government to take over Sky. The new culture secretary, Jeremy Wright, will clear the bid in an announcement scheduled to be made by the end of the day on Thursday. Earlier this week, the Guardian revealed that Murdoch would gain clearance to finally take over Sky after 18 months of battling regulatory red tape and political opposition to the deal, and raise his bid. Wright, who has only been in the job days, will deliver the result on a final consultation on plans to make Murdoch sell Sky News to reduce his control of UK news media. The government said on Tuesday it had only had five responses to the consultation. As well as selling Sky News, most probably to Disney, Murdoch must also top up any potential shortfall in funding by the channel\u2019s new owner to keep its budget at \u00a3100m for the next 15 years. The battle for Sky is playing out against a larger fight between Disney and Comcast to take over most of 21st Century Fox, which owns 39% of Sky as well as assets including the Hollywood studio behind films such as Deadpool and X-Men. Last month, Disney, which has offered to buy Sky News from Murdoch to help him secure clearance to buy Sky, upped its offer for Fox to $71.3bn ($38 a share). Earlier in the month, Comcast had trumped Disney\u2019s first offer for Fox ($55.4bn; $28 a share) with a $65bn, or $35 a share, bid. Fox shareholders are due to vote on Disney\u2019s offer on 27 July, unless Comcast ups its bid again as rumoured. The spiralling price tag for Fox has significant ramifications on the ultimate price that will be paid to win the separate battle for Sky. In April, the UK Takeover Panel ruled that if Disney successfully takes over Fox before Murdoch, Comcast or another bidder has taken full control of Sky, then it will be forced to buy out the 61% of the satellite group it does not own. The panel ruled that Disney would have to buy the stake at \u00a310.75 a share \u2013 the now 18-month-old bid price tabled by Murdoch. This \u201cchain principle\u201d is designed to make sure minority shareholders are treated fairly; in this case to ensure Sky\u2019s minority shareholders receive the same amount as 21st Century Fox. The rule would also apply to Comcast if it beats Disney in agreeing a deal to buy Fox. However, after Disney significantly upped its bid for Fox, the UK Takeover Panel is looking at whether it should be forced to pay a much higher price. Disney\u2019s new bid for Fox is 36% higher than its original one, which has led analysts to suggest that premium could be extended to Sky to make Disney pay at least \u00a314.62 a share. The battle for Sky should be over in September, with either Fox or Comcast the winner \u2013 unless a surprise new bidder emerges. This means it is highly unlikely that whoever is ultimately victorious in the hunt for Fox \u2013 Disney or Comcast \u2013 will find itself having to make a move for an unsold part of Sky when the deal completes in the US next year. However, the Takeover Panel ruling, which could also be announced this week, could theoretically set a new, higher, price floor for buying Sky than Murdoch\u2019s latest bid.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "BT has been hit by a significant shareholder rebellion over its outgoing chief executive Gavin Patterson\u2019s \u00a32.3m pay packet. At its annual meeting in Edinburgh, 34.2% of investors voted against the telecoms group\u2019s remuneration report, including the payout to Patterson. The AGM result will lead to BT being placed on a public register of firms in which more than 20% of shareholders have voted against an executive pay resolution. Patterson\u2019s 2017 pay package was revealed in May, only weeks after he unveiled a new strategy for the embattled company, including 13,000 job cuts in a bid to slash costs. The payout included a performance bonus of \u00a31.3m for the year to the end of March. In June, BT announced that Patterson was leaving, after a backlash from shareholders over the company\u2019s poor performance and concerns that Patterson was not the right person to lead the company through an ambitious restructuring plan. He is due to step down later this year after a replacement is appointed. Overall BT\u2019s top management pocketed \u00a321.5m in pay, bonuses and share awards last year, 23.5% more than the previous 12 months. BT said: \u201cWe are naturally disappointed with the lower level of support received for our remuneration report for the year ending 31 March 2018.\u201d It added that it was mostly related to the annual bonus payment to Patterson. The company said it had been been talking to its main shareholders over the past two weeks to discuss their concerns and vowed to do more to listen to investors. BT said: \u201cDuring the remainder of 2018 we will engage further with our shareholders and proxy advisers to understand in full detail the reasons for their concerns and whether we should consider any changes to our longer-term approach to remuneration.\u201d Several shareholder advisory groups, including ISS and Pirc, had urged investors to oppose the payout to BT\u2019s chief executive. Pirc said: \u201cThe company\u2019s recent poor share performance, the decision to cut 13,000 jobs in order to deal with losses and the losses brought about by BT Italy\u2019s accounting practices are not reflected in the CEO\u2019s remuneration.\u201d The company is under pressure for its poor performance, including an accounting scandal at its Italian division, which led to a \u00a3530m writedown and a big fall in its share price last year. The scandal resulted in Patterson\u2019s pay being cut by \u00a34m to \u00a31.34m in 2016-17. There have been a number of shareholder rebellions this year at companies ranging from the drugmaker AstraZeneca to the turnaround specialist Melrose. Royal Mail could also face an investor revolt over executive pay at its annual meeting in Sheffield on 19 July. It has been criticised by two investor advisory groups, ISS and Glass Lewis, for its decision to pay its new chief executive, Rico Back, a higher salary than his predecessor. ISS is also concerned that the outgoing CEO, Moya Greene, will leave with a payoff of more than \u00a3900,000. In a statement, Royal Mail said: \u201cWe recognise that executive remuneration is a sensitive issue in the current economic environment. Our remuneration approach remains to recruit, retain and motivate executives of a high calibre that have the experience and expertise to lead our very large and complex company through a period of intensive change. \u201cWe have sought to ensure that Rico Back and Moya Greene\u2019s overall fixed cash remuneration \u2013 their base salary, pension entitlements and benefits \u2013 are broadly the same. So Rico\u2019s annual salary is higher than Moya\u2019s to compensate for the halving of the cash pension allowance he would have received were this the same as the pension allowance Moya received. It is worth noting that the potential increase in Rico\u2019s variable pay is subject to meeting stringent performance conditions.\u201d",

He is due to step down later this year after a replacement is appointed.</p> <p>Overall BT\u2019s top management pocketed \u00a321.5m in pay, bonuses and share awards last year, 23.5% more than the previous 12 months. </p> <p>BT said: \u201cWe are naturally disappointed with the lower level of support received for our remuneration report for the year ending 31 March 2018.\u201d It added that it was mostly related to the annual bonus payment to Patterson. </p> <p>The company said it had been been talking to its main shareholders over the past two weeks to discuss their concerns and vowed to do more to listen to investors.</p> <p>BT said: \u201cDuring the remainder of 2018 we will engage further with our shareholders and proxy advisers to understand in full detail the reasons for their concerns and whether we should consider any changes to our longer-term approach to remuneration.\u201d</p> <p>Several shareholder advisory groups, including ISS and Pirc, had urged investors to oppose the payout to BT\u2019s chief executive. <br></p> <p>Pirc said: \u201cThe company\u2019s recent poor share performance, the decision to cut 13,000 jobs in order to deal with losses and the losses brought about by BT Italy\u2019s accounting practices are not reflected in the CEO\u2019s remuneration.\u201d <br></p> <p>The company is under pressure for its poor performance, including an<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/24/bt-loses-7bn-in-value-as-italian-accounting-scandal-deepens\"> accounting scandal at its Italian division</a>, which led to a \u00a3530m writedown and a big fall in its share price last year. The scandal resulted in Patterson\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/may/11/bt-chief-pay-italy-accounting-scandal-gavin-patterson-bonus\">pay being cut by \u00a34m to \u00a31.34m</a> in 2016-17.</p> <p>There have been a number of shareholder rebellions this year at companies ranging from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/18/astrazeneca-rocked-by-shareholder-revolt-over-executive-pay\">drugmaker AstraZeneca</a> to the turnaround specialist Melrose. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Guardian business email sign-up\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for\u00a0Business\u00a0Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Royal Mail could also face an investor revolt over executive pay at its annual meeting in Sheffield on 19 July. </p> <p>It has been criticised by two investor advisory groups, ISS and Glass Lewis, for its decision to pay its new chief executive, Rico Back, a higher salary than his predecessor. ISS is also concerned that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/20/royal-mail-moya-greene-to-step-down-as-chief-executive-rico-back\">the outgoing CEO, Moya Greene</a>, will leave with a payoff of more than \u00a3900,000.</p> <p>In a statement, Royal Mail said: \u201cWe recognise that executive remuneration is a sensitive issue in the current economic environment. Our remuneration approach remains to recruit, retain and motivate executives of a high calibre that have the experience and expertise to lead our very large and complex company through a period of intensive change.</p> <p>\u201cWe have sought to ensure that Rico Back and Moya Greene\u2019s overall fixed cash remuneration \u2013 their base salary, pension entitlements and benefits \u2013 are broadly the same. So Rico\u2019s annual salary is higher than Moya\u2019s to compensate for the halving of the cash pension allowance he would have received were this the same as the pension allowance Moya received. It is worth noting that the potential increase in Rico\u2019s variable pay is subject to meeting stringent performance conditions.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Burberry has warned of falling sales in the UK and Europe as a stronger pound and euro deter Chinese tourists. The luxury fashion house, known for its distinctive check motif and trenchcoats, posted revenues of \u00a3479m in the 13 weeks to 30 June, compared with \u00a3478m a year earlier. Same-store sales grew 3%, down from the 4% growth reported this time last year. Sales fell by \u201ca low single-digit percentage rate\u201d in the UK and Europe because of weaker tourism demand. Burberry shares dropped 3.6% in early trading on the news. Sterling has strengthened over the past year, making the UK a less attractive destination for shoppers. The euro has also strengthened. The pound was trading at around $1.41 in early April, compared with $1.24 a year earlier. Julie Brown, the firm\u2019s chief operating and financial officer, said: \u201cWe had far fewer Chinese tourists coming to the UK and Europe. They were shopping more in Asia.\u201d She said Chinese consumers \u2013 who account for 40% of Burberry\u2019s sales \u2013 were very sensitive to currency movements and tended to travel and shop in countries that offer the most favourable exchange rates. The sharp decline in the pound in the months after the Brexit vote two years ago lured more Chinese tourists to Britain but as the currency started to recover those numbers dwindled. Instead, they have been shopping in Hong Kong, South Korea, Japan and mainland China, boosting Burberry\u2019s sales in Asia Pacific by a mid-single-digit percentage. Burberry has introduced new handbags such as the D-ring and complementary tops and skirts, and has revamped its trenchcoats. The new belt bag, priced at \u00a31,390 to \u00a31,790, is selling well in China, along with car coats and \u00a31,690 tropical gabardine trenchcoats. Brown said there was also a slight decline in spending by domestic shoppers in Britain. Sales in the Americas grew by a high single-digit percentage as the improving US economy encouraged more consumers to buy Burberry products. The fashion house is gearing up for the debut collection from its new chief creative officer, Riccardo Tisci, to be presented during London fashion week on 17 September. Tisci is a former designer for Givenchy, where he used shark teeth and nose ring motifs. Burberry plans to launch pieces from the collection in \u201cinstant drops\u201d from September, aiming for more frequent product launches in future. Brown said: \u201cIt\u2019s all about exciting the consumer with frequent drops, freshness.\u201d The firm is also collaborating with the veteran British designer Vivienne Westwood, whose collection will be in stores in December. Marco Gobbetti, Burberry\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cWhile we know it will take time to achieve our ambitions, our progress to date and the energy in and around the company give me confidence for the future.\u201d Mamequa Boafo, a senior retail analyst at GlobalData, said: \u201cThe brand\u2019s overall strategy to invest in a number of key territories is a wise one in order to counteract the challenging sales faced in the domestic market and support future growth.\u201d Burberry said its partnership with the online marketplace Farfetch, which started in February, was performing ahead of expectations. It will give Burberry access to more than 150 countries. The UBS analyst Helen Brand said: \u201cWe see a potential long-term improvement story at Burberry but \u2026 investors are hoping for the benefits of a turnaround to show somewhat sooner.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The online grocer Ocado has outlined ambitious expansion plans that include a move beyond groceries into using its hi-tech warehouses to sell clothing and homeware. The company was dubbed the \u201cMicrosoft of retail\u201d by one analyst after recently signing a blockbuster deal with the US supermarket Kroger which propelled the company into the FTSE 100. \u201cWe need to focus not just on what we have to do today but we have to make sure we innovate for the future,\u201d said Ocado\u2019s chief executive, Tim Steiner, as he updated the City on trading for the six months to 3 June. \u201cThere\u2019s a big market in food but we are also exploring other applications where our skills at moving things are just as useful as they are in the food market.\u201d Ocado has just opened a second general merchandise warehouse in Erith, south London, which is able to handle an extra \u00a3200m of non-food sales annually. The company already handles online orders for Dobbies garden centres, which is chaired by the former Ocado finance director Andrew Bracey. The company\u2019s shares closed up 9% at \u00a311.03, the biggest riser on the FTSE 100. The recovery came after a dip of more than 7% in early trading after the company warning the City to expect a bigger than expected annual loss in 2018. Before the update analysts had pencilled in a pre-tax loss of \u00a316.1m but the company cited increased investment in its warehouses, where groceries are picked by robots, and a \u00a39m charge relating to management bonuses. After several years hawking its wares around the globe, Ocado has signed a flurry of international partnership deals, including with Groupe Casino of France and Canada\u2019s Sobeys. The deals have fuelled a 250% rise in Ocado\u2019s share price over the last year which means managers, including Steiner who is one of the company\u2019s founders, are in line for hefty stock price-related payouts. With a market value of more than \u00a37.4bn, Ocado is now worth more than Morrisons, which is the UK\u2019s fourth biggest supermarket, and Marks &amp; Spencer. The update came as the company reported a pre-tax loss of \u00a39m for the six months to 3 June on sales up 12% at \u00a3800m. The performance reflected heavy investment in its warehouse in Andover, in Hampshire. The company hired more than 150 new software and hardware engineers during the period, boosting the total number of technical experts it employs to 1,550. Ocado warned in February investment in its UK distribution centres and software platform would dent profits in 2018. At that time it said capital expenditure would be \u00a3210m in 2018, up from \u00a3160m in 2017, as it pumped cash into fine-tuning the expensive technology behind its hi-tech warehouses.",
