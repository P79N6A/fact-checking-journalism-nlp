      "bodyText": "So-called \"low fat\" foods can contain a similar number of calories to the standard versions \u2013 and in some cases contain even more sugar, according to a study by a consumer watchdog. The investigation by Which? found that as many as six out of 10 consumers eat low-fat and light foods several times a week believing that they are a healthier option and can help them to lose weight. But its \"snapshot sample\" of 12 low-fat, reduced and light products from supermarkets compared with their standard counterparts found minimal differences in calorie content. Among the foods singled out are a standard McVitie's chocolate digestive, which contains 85 calories, compared with 77 in the \"light\" version \u2013 a difference of just eight calories. A Tesco low-fat yogurt has more calories per pot \u2013 130 \u2013 compared with the Activia standard yoghurt, containing 123 calories. The Tesco yogurt also contained more sugar \u2013 20.2g (equivalent to more than four teaspoons) per pot rather than 16.9g in the Activia version. Which? said its research also uncovered misconceptions among consumers about what the terms \"reduced fat\" and \"light\" mean. Products labelled with these terms only have to contain 30% less fat than the standard version, yet only 16% of people surveyed understood this. Labelling regulations define low fat as containing less than 3% fat, the terms reduced fat, light and lite mean 30% less fat than the standard or original product, and more than 20g of fat per 100g makes a product high in fat. More than 5g saturated fat per 100g means it is high in saturated fat.Which? executive director Richard Lloyd said: \"Consumers are choosing 'low-fat' and 'light' options believing them to be a healthier choice, but our research has found that in many cases they're just not living up to their healthy image. Our advice to consumers is to read the nutritional labels carefully.\" Which? has been campaigning for the supermarkets to add clearer labelling to packaging so consumers can make a more informed choice about what they eat. It is calling on Morrisons and Iceland, the two remaining supermarkets yet to adopt the traffic light labelling system, to do so as soon as possible. In August Tesco backed down and announced it would develop a \"hybrid\" labelling system incorporating both traffic lights and its long-favoured GDA system showing \"guideline daily amounts\" without colours. A Tesco spokesperson said of its yogurt product: \"We take seriously our responsibility to help our customers make healthy choices. Our products display clear nutritional information on the front of the packaging, and we always act in accordance with the strict rules around the use of words such as reduced or light.\" United Biscuits, which makes the McVitie's chocolate digestive, said the report was misleading about its products. A spokesman said: \"While it focused on the fact that the Lights variant of the McVitie's chocolate digestive had only eight fewer calories per biscuit than the standard product, it ignored the fact that the Lights version had 30% less fat. \"It also wrongly suggested that the fat reduction was achieved by reducing the amount of chocolate on the Light variant \u2013 this is not the case. The fat reduction has been achieved through changes to the biscuit dough recipe.\" Rebecca Smithers",

Hibu repeated its July warning that the shares, which have fallen 90% this year, could become worthless.</p> <p>\"While no decision has yet been made, certain options may result in a dilution of existing shareholders' interests including some options which may attribute little or no value to the group's ordinary shares,\" the company stated.</p> <p>Analysts had been forecasting an average of \u00a3300m of full-year earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortisation (ebitda), and have now revised their predictions, with the figure reset at \u00a3270m.

With borrowings of \u00a32.2bn as of July and a dying directories business, Hibu's lenders are in talks to take control of the company in a debt-for-equity swap that could lead to the shareholders being wiped out. Hibu repeated its July warning that the shares, which have fallen 90% this year, could become worthless. \"While no decision has yet been made, certain options may result in a dilution of existing shareholders' interests including some options which may attribute little or no value to the group's ordinary shares,\" the company stated. Analysts had been forecasting an average of \u00a3300m of full-year earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortisation (ebitda), and have now revised their predictions, with the figure reset at \u00a3270m. This compares with ebitda of \u00a3460m in the year to 31 March, on revenues of \u00a31.6bn. \"This is another profit warning and the shares are probably totally worthless,\" said Panmure Gordon &amp; Co analyst Alex Degroote. Hibu, which changed its name from Yell earlier this year, recently formed a co-ordinating committee of its lenders, which include the Royal Bank of Scotland, Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank. A restructuring plan is expected shortly, although this may not come in time for half-year results on 13 November. The plan could result in part of the debt being cancelled and Hibu's departure from the stock exchange. The company ran into difficulties after embarking on a debt-fuelled international expansion drive \u2013 it spent \u20ac3.3bn (\u00a32.66bn) buying a Spanish directories business \u2013 just as people were beginning to use Google to look up phone numbers and local businesses.",

    "webTitle": "Asos humbles French Connection in the high street fashion battle", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Clothing website Asos has emerged as one of the victors in the fashion wars. Its stellar quarterly growth figures contrasted sharply with the dire fortunes of high street chain French Connection, which now expects to plunge into the red this year. French Connection lost \u00a36.3m in the first six months of the year as shoppers defected to cheaper rivals such as Zara and Primark, as well as Asos, to get the latest catwalk trends at high street prices. With UK like-for-like sales down nearly 10% and a full-year loss now \"highly likely\", the French Connection management team on Wednesday admitted for the first time that the company's prices were too high and that a major shake-up of both its clothing ranges and pricing was now on the cards. Announcing a two-year turnaround plan, operations director Neil Williams conceded that the company's recent collections \"didn't resonate with customers\" and that it needed to respond faster to changing trends if it was to win back its internet-savvy target audience of 25-to-34-year-olds. \"Some of our top end pricing had got away from where the sweet spots are,\" he said. \"There's a price at which people will say 'that's what I'm prepared to pay for a nice French Connection dress or top' and you will see more product clustered around that price point.\" As French Connection's star has waned, Asos's has risen, and that was reflected in their share prices on Thursday: French Connection closed down 8% at 23p while Asos finished up more than 14% at \u00a323.30. Asos, which targets young women looking to emulate the designer looks of celebrities such as Alexa Chung, Tulisa Contostavlos and Kate Moss, reported growth of 31% in the fourth quarter thanks in part to strong trading in overseas markets such as the United States and Australia. The quarterly figures showed a pick-up in UK sales, up 15% compared with 8% in the previous period. Despite grim figures from Next last week, chief executive Nick Robertson said he had not detected a slowdown in August and early September, adding: \"August is always a bit slower for us. All the kids are in Ibiza and partying.\" Faced with weak demand for its products, French Connection was forced to discount heavily to clear unsold stock. The retailer has since made changes to its design team: among the initiatives announced was a staff training push to improve customer service. Williams said that the brand was holding its own online but needed to get a better performance out of its shops. The retailer is trying to dispose of 15 loss-making stores. Conlumino analyst Neil Saunders said there was a sense that the French Connection brand had become \"rather stale\" and had \"lost its way\". Online sellers such as Asos have gained market share by providing relatively cheap fast-fashion fixes, Saunders said, adding: \"Against such a vibrant market, French Connection is looking increasingly colourless.\" The challenge faced by French Connection was emphasised by better than expected figures from Spanish fashion juggernaut Inditex. The owner of the Zara chain said profits had jumped 32% to \u20ac944m in the six months to 31 July, with like-for-like sales up 7%. Inditex, whose founder Amancio Ortega is now Spain's richest person and the world's fifth-wealthiest according to the Forbes list of billionaires, was one of the pioneers of the fast fashion retailing model which sees new products flow into store every week to keep shoppers coming back for more. Tesco boss: apps are the new high street Tesco boss Philip Clarke has warned that the \"tectonic plates are shifting\" in the retail industry as shoppers increasingly rely on the internet and smartphones. \"People are opting out of stores,\" he said. \"Apps have become the new high street.\" Clarke, speaking at the World Retail Congress, said half the people looking at Tesco's food website were doing so to check prices rather than shop. Since taking charge of the supermarket group last year, Clarke has put the brakes on expansion and focused on revamping stores and investing in new technology. He added on the retailer's new blog Talking Shop that new stores were about \"new customers, not loving the customers we've got\". \"We needed to invest more in our customers, in the stores they are using today with better quality products and more staff. And if we're investing in tomorrow's customers, our money is better spent online because that's where the future growth is,\" he said.",

The latest sub-plot may be of interest only to addicts of the drama, but Hector Sants, former chief executive of the Financial Services Authority, is determined to be heard. He takes issue with paragraph 116 of the Treasury select committee's report into the Libor scandal, where it is recorded that Barclays' dodgy submissions \"were not raised by the FSA at that time [September 2010] as casting doubt on his [Diamond's] suitability as CEO.\" That's what Marcus Agius, Barclays' chairman, told the MPs. But Sants reckons Agius has got his facts wrong. The FSA, says Sants, did consider the Libor investigation at the time but concluded it could not prejudge its outcome. Thus the FSA told Agius that it reserved the right to reassess Diamond's suitability for the top job upon completion of its investigation. Are the two accounts really at odds? Not fundamentally. There was nothing factually incorrect in Agius's letter since the FSA had conceded that it would not prejudge the findings. On the other hand, Sants's touchiness is understandable since Agius could \u2013 and probably should \u2013 have volunteered the fact that the FSA reserved the right to change its mind. But there's no new scandal here. Indeed, Diamond wasn't even forced out because of the Libor conclusions, when they finally came. His departure instead came when regulators, after a public outcry, told Agius they had lost faith in Diamond's ability to restore Barclays' battered reputation. The real mystery is why Agius took so long to understand that Diamond had to go. On that score, outsiders will be more intrigued by the bizarre language used by Agius at the time of Diamond's appointment. His assessment, revealed in Wednesday's documents, reads like a public-school head teacher's report on a promising, but sometimes wayward, 16-year-old who is being given the chance to show his worth by becoming a prefect. Bob is said to be a \"very competitive\" chap, but one who is expected to \"mature and relax\" into his new role with the help of John Varley, outgoing head-boy-cum-chief-executive, who will be on hand to \"coach\" him. In reality, Bob was a 59-year-old who had risen to the top of the cut-and-thrust world of investment banking. Very strange.",

His assessment, revealed in Wednesday's documents, reads like a public-school head teacher's report on a promising, but sometimes wayward, 16-year-old who is being given the chance to show his worth by becoming a prefect.</p> <p>Bob is said to be a \"very competitive\" chap, but one who is expected to \"mature and relax\" into his new role with the help of John Varley, outgoing head-boy-cum-chief-executive, who will be on hand to \"coach\" him. In reality, Bob was a 59-year-old who had risen to the top of the cut-and-thrust world of investment banking. Very strange.</p>",

Sportingbet, shirt sponsors of Wolverhampton Wanderers football club, had last year been in lengthy takeover discussions with William Hill's closest competitor Ladbrokes. A deal could not be thrashed out, however, because of legal concerns about Sportingbet's activities in unregulated markets. Traditional high street bookmakers are racing to expand their online businesses to keep pace with liberalising markets around the world and technologic advances that are transforming the range of products offered to sports betting punters. Shares in Sportingbet, which have been rising in recent months, closed up 7.25p at 51p following an announcement from William Hill on Wednesday. This values the business at \u00a3330m. Sportingbet's Australian business accounts for about half of the group's revenues and the lion's share of profits. Spain \u2013 a newly regulated online market \u2013 represents a further 14% of revenues. Other important territories include Greece, Germany and the UK. In a statement to the stock market, William Hill said it was at the early stages of considering an offer for Sportingbet. It is in discussions with potential co-bidder GVC, an internet bookmaker listed on the junior AIM market which last year indirectly took over Sportingbet's controversial Turkish business Superbahis.com. The Turkish authorities have said they regard this site's activities as illegal. William Hill said any offer would be substantially in cash with an element of GVC shares also forming part of the consideration. The betting shop group already has an internet joint venture with London-listed Playtech, called William Hill Online, though it is thought the acquisition of Sportingbet businesses would be held separately from that operation. Founded in 1998 by Mark Blandford, who had previously run a small chain of betting shops, Sportingbet rapidly grew into one of the largest online gambling businesses in the world, acquiring a string of international rivals, many of which accepted bets from countries where internet bets were unregulated or even considered illegal. With the acquisition of US-focused Paradise Poker in 2004, Sportingbet became one of the stock market's fastest growing companies and, a year later, was valued at more than \u00a31bn. Its chairman, Peter Dicks, was arrested on a Louisiana state indictment in 2006 but charges were later dropped. However, by the autumn of that year, new US laws made it illegal for banks to process credit card payments for gambling, effectively wiping out much of Sportingbet's revenues. In March this year the firm paid the final instalment on a \u00a321.3m fine to secure a non-prosecution agreement with Preet Bharara, the US attorney for the southern district of New York.

Lower down the market Hibu, the ridiculous new name for Yellow Pages group Yell, dropped 35% to 0.44p after it warned again on profits and repeated that its restructuring discussions could lead to an outcome where its ordinary shares had no value. In a similar boat were shareholders in AEA Technology, down 33% to 0.06p. The environmental advisor said it was in talks with a number of parties, but that none of these were likely to lead to an offer for the company, meaning there will be little or no value for shareholders. It suffered a shareholder rebellion at its annual meeting over its remuneration report, surely too little too late as a protest?",

      "bodyText": "BP says it is in \"advanced talks\" with potential purchasers for its Texas City refinery \u2013 one of its most troubled assets \u2013 and is expecting to sell it before the end of the year. Shares in BP were up 2.2p to 441.2p by mid-afternoon on Wednesday amid speculation that US company Marathon Petroleum was poised to take over America's third largest refinery for around $2.5bn (\u00a31.5bn). Neither Marathon nor BP would comment on the identity of any possible purchaser but the UK-based company admitted it was close to the disposal of the refinery where 15 people were killed and 170 injured in an explosion seven years ago. \"We are in advanced discussions regarding potential sale. We have engaged a number of interested, qualified industry participants. We remain on track to announce a transaction before year end,\" said BP in a statement. The sale has been triggered by BP's desire to raise $38bn of cash to pay for liabilities and possible fines related to another disaster: the 2010 Deepwater Horizon spill in the Gulf of Mexico. BP has also been happy to scale down its refining operations, where profit margins have been thin for many years. The energy group recently disposed of the Carson refinery in California to Tesoro for $2.25bn but said it planned to hang on to three core US sites: Whiting in Indiana, Cherry Point in Washington and Toledo in Ohio. Earlier this month BP sold off oil and gas fields in the Gulf of Mexico to Plains Exploration for $5.5bn and revealed it had asked a Louisiana court to approve a multibillion-dollar settlement over the Deepwater Horizon incident with hundreds of private claimants. But that filing provoked a fierce response from the US department of justice, which said it still expected to find the company guilty of gross negligence in a court case which restarts in January. There had been hopes that the department and BP were close to some kind of out-of-court settlement. The sale of Texas City would bring to an end a sorry chapter in BP's history: safety authorities found the company guilty of over 300 violations after the fire and slapped a record fine on it.",

      "bodyText": "November is likely to be chilly, yet there could be a little warmth flowing in the direction of stock market traders should the Bank of England inject a further \u00a350bn of new, freshly printed money into the economy, as looks increasingly likely. The stock market likes nothing better than cheap funds to play with when there is little in the real economy to get excited about. Most economists seem to think the latest minutes from the central bank's monetary policy committee, released on Wednesday morning, show its quantitative easing (QE) programme will rise from \u00a3375bn to \u00a3425bn when the current spending spree is completed in two months time. QE involves the central bank buying government bonds from high street banks, insurers and other financial companies in the hope they lend the money to businesses or buy shares in corporate Britain via the stock market. A debate over whether QE has run out of steam seems to be heading down a blind alley. While the government sits on its hands, fearful of a bond market backlash against any hint of spending, the Bank of England's QE programme is the only game in town. The British Chambers of Commerce wants the bank's governor, Sir Mervyn King, to spend the money more imaginatively, but recognises QE's supporters are more numerous and influential. David Kern, chief economist at the BCC, points out that there is clearly a sense of momentum inside the MPC and the financial markets are expecting a QE increase sooner rather than later. Expectations are important to central banks and having built up the expectation of more QE, MPC members will be loath to disappoint. Kern said monetary easing by the European Central Bank, the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan will probably reinforce pressures for an increase. \"But we still think the MPC should be cautious and refrain from adding to QE unless the UK financial system faces new threats due to developments in the eurozone. It is important that additional QE is not used to limit falls in inflation over the next year, as a temporary fall below the 2% target would support demand.\" Kern view is reflected across much of industry and there are some supporters inside Threadneedle Street who are sympathetic to the idea that QE has run its course and now is the time for something else. However, QE has one little discussed benefit: it pushes down the value of the pound. And maybe we are witnessing a race to the bottom by the world's major currencies. Is a cheaper currency a key policy objective? Overnight the Bank of Japan added to its own QE policy. Ostensibly the plan is to keep money flowing around the world's banking system. Another view says it is part of a desperate fight to prevent the yen inflating against the dollar after the Fed said it would start QE3 using $50bn a month until the US economy improves. The dollar rose 14% during the summer while the pound fell 11% and the euro 16% against a basket of currencies. The yen is up 50% against the dollar since the financial crash. Simon Smith, chief economist at currency dealer FxPro, points out that the Fed's plan is killing Japanese exporters and the BoJ could be forced to continue printing yen to counter the Fed's QE3. If exporting is the answer to flat domestic demand, then a lower currency is a key to unlocking foreign markets. The trouble is that if everyone is fighting the same battle using the same tools, it becomes fruitless. Everyone ends up back where they started, though with hundreds of billions of extra currency swashing around the financial system.",

      "bodyText": "Mortgages with a 30-year lifespan are on the rise. The Office for National Statistics reveals that 23.3%, or almost a quarter, of all new mortgages are spread over three decades or more. The 25-year mortgage has been dying since the early 1990s when it accounted for 70% of all mortgages. Today the figure is just 30%. It's a worrying process that shows an increasing proportion of mortgage buyers opting to pay over a longer period. After the financial crash of 2008 panicked borrowers appeared to be more debt-conscious. In 2008 and 2009 the proportion of 30-year mortgages went into decline for the first time and by 2010 accounted for 19.1% of mortgages bought in that year. But the figures for 2011 show 23.3% of mortgage buyers stretching their repayments again over 30 or more years. Bob Pannell, chief economist at the Council of Mortgage Lenders, says the lengthening of mortgage terms reflects the increasing cost of a mortgage. He warns against reading too much into the figures because the move to regular remortgaging every two years and the rise of interest-only loans complicated the picture before 2007. In this environment, saying you had a 25-year or 30-year mortgage was less relevant. However, it is still the case that monthly mortgage payments are calculated over a set period and the easiest way to cut the monthly bill is to tell the lender payments should be over 30 years and not 25 years as previously agreed. Does this tell us that there are more people on the edge of being repossessed whose only option is to almost turn their mortgage into a rental payment it lasts so long? Pannell says it shows that as house prices have risen and regulations become more stringent on the sale of mortgages, first-time buyers and existing home owners have decided to take longer to pay off their mortgages. It is an affordability issue. We cannot tell from the figures how many are distressed homeowners. But there is an argument that old rules stipulating 25-year terms over which the capital is repaid should be applied even more rigorously. The only result of lax mortgage rules is higher prices. It creates a demand where there would be none if people were told they don't have the income to cope. If we are wiser after the worst financial crash in modern times, it should be to say no more to higher loan-to-value calculations, teaser rates that are unaffordable over the longer term and a disregard for the borrower's ability to pay in a sensible timescale.
