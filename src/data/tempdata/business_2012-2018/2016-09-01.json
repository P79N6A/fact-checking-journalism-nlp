Apple has always been about doing the right thing, never the easy thing.\u201d So said its chief executive, Tim Cook, on Thursday, still hopping mad about the European commission\u2019s ruling that the iPhone-maker should pay \u20ac13bn (\u00a311bn) in back-taxes to Ireland. The plea of wounded innocence \u2013 plus the accompanying folksy tale about the company\u2019s 37-year \u201cmarriage\u201d with the people of Ireland \u2013 would be more persuasive if Cook would explain how on earth paying a corporate tax rate of 0.005% on European profits in 2014 fits with doing the right thing. Cook says he disputes the commission\u2019s numbers. Maybe so, but the EU competition chief, Margrethe Vestager, had a sharp retort: allow the world to see the confidential calculations on which the commission reached its conclusion. \u201cIf it was up to me, the confidential version would have been published yesterday ... It is very good for everyone to see our reasoning,\u201d said Vestager. The non-confidential version, as explained by the commission on Tuesday, makes a strong case that Apple\u2019s choice of corporate structure in Ireland went well beyond any commonsense understanding of legitimate tax planning. The bulk of profits were channelled through \u201chead offices\u201d that were not based in any country and did not have employees or premises. Those profits ended up being untaxed anywhere, not even in the US, alleges the commission. Apple, we might agree, wasn\u2019t doing the easy thing; it was engaged in something difficult, in the sense of convoluted and elaborate. Cook \u2013 who knows? \u2013 may be right that the commission\u2019s ruling will be overturned on appeal. Brussels\u2019 power to interfere in a long-standing tax deal between a EU national government and a company is unclear. And, as a competition commissioner, Vestager may have gone beyond her brief in making judgments on what constitutes illegal state aid. Yet Cook, before denouncing the affair as \u201cpolitical crap\u201d should put himself in his customers\u2019 shoes. Most aren\u2019t free to exploit the difference between the tax residency rules of Ireland and the US. Many are sick of the over-aggessive tax tactics deployed by too many multinationals. Some will conclude that Apple\u2019s use of head offices that existed only on paper was a prime example of \u201ccorporate crap\u201d that requires a fuller explanation by the company. CBI needs to focus on infrastructure not banks The CBI has always had a soft spot for banks (they\u2019re some of its biggest members) but its director-general, Carolyn Fairbairn, is pushing her luck in calling for gentler treatment for the industry from regulators and government. Specifically, she wants the mission statements of the Prudential Regulation Authority and the Financial Conduct Authority to be rewritten so that \u201cgrowth and innovation\u201d become part of regulators\u2019 \u201craison d\u2019\u00eatre\u201d. The call is framed as a need to ensure the financial services industry is competitive after Brexit, but it sounds suspiciously like a plea to return to the pre-crash era of light-touch regulation. No thanks. For good measure, Fairbairn wants the government to set a date to end the corporation tax surcharge on banks\u2019 profits, the successor to the bank levy introduced by the former chancellor George Osborne to help clean up after the crash. Good luck with that. The levy-cum-surcharge brings in decent money for the Treasury and one suspects it will be around for at least a decade yet. The CBI would be better advised to concentrate on calling for more (and smarter) infrastructure spending to benefit the economy as a whole. The chances of success are greater, and the issue is surely closer to the hearts of its rank-and-file members. Stress to impress - the City\u2019s unwritten dress code Always be prepared for Lord Rothschild to ring and invite you to lunch today, advised an esteemed City editor early in your correspondent\u2019s career. Lord R never called at short notice but the sartorial advice was sound. An unwritten dress code operates in the City, so best not to put yourself at a tactical disadvantage. There is, though, a world of difference between such commonsense instruction to look smart and the practices of the recruitment departments of investment banks, as described by the Social Mobility Commission. A loud tie, brown shoes (unless you\u2019re from continental Europe, apparently) or an ill-fitting suit can kill a graduate interviewee\u2019s chances, says the report. All fail the test for \u201cpolish\u201d. Unbelievable? Sadly, it rings true. The City has always been obsessed by appearance. Remember Swiss bank UBS\u2019 40-page guide to staff in 2010 that included a ban on eating onions and garlic? The commission claims investment banks\u2019 fussiness-cum-prejudice is really a way to \u201cset up barriers for individuals from non-privileged backgrounds\u201d. Hard to prove definitively.

      "bodyText": "Ireland may have to revise its annual GDP figures for the past decade following the European commission\u2019s ruling that the majority of Apple\u2019s overseas profits should have been taxable in the Republic. Europe\u2019s competition watchdog ruled on Tuesday that the company owed the Irish government \u20ac13bn (\u00a310.9bn) in unpaid taxes on profits from international sales routed through subsidiaries in Ireland. When interest is added the final bill could reach \u20ac19bn. \u201cIf the European commission have ruled this profit should be taxable in Ireland, it should be reflected in the GDP numbers,\u201d said Seamus Coffey, lecturer in economics at University College Cork. He believes the revision, which could be required by the European statistics agency Eurostat, could show that the Irish economy was growing between 6% and 8% a year from 2010 onwards. This would represent a dramatic change, at least on paper: Ireland\u2019s GDP shrank in 2012 and growth was recorded at zero in 2011. \u201cThe commission is essentially reallocating the profits from the US to Ireland,\u201d said Coffey. \u201cThey are now saying the output produced in Ireland is billions higher. The 2015 number won\u2019t change. What will happen is the years before it will rise up.\u201d Following this week\u2019s ruling, which Apple has vowed to appeal against, Ireland must now recover unpaid taxes from Apple for the years 2003 to 2014. The cash will not transfer immediately to the Irish revenue. Apple\u2019s chief executive Tim Cook has confirmed that a sum based on the commission\u2019s calculations will be paid into an escrow account pending the end of the appeals process. Apple books the vast majority of its non-US revenues through Ireland, and the amounts passing through the books of its two principal subsidiaries in the Irish Republic have been significant since 2010, when sales of the iPhone and iPad ballooned. Between 2009 and 2014, Apple\u2019s pre-tax earnings from outside the US rose from $6.6bn to $33.6bn. They were $47.6bn (\u00a335.8bn) last year. A statistical change in the rate at which the economy grew could have material consequences. In July, the finance minister, Michael Noonan, confirmed Ireland would have to contribute an additional \u20ac280m to the European Union budget to reflect a recent revision to its growth. Ireland\u2019s GDP grew by an astonishing 26.3% in 2015, according to revised statistics published by the government in July. The rate is nearly three times the highest level recorded during the so-called Celtic Tiger boom years and was far ahead of a previous estimate of 7.8%. Nobel prizewinner Paul Krugman described the figures as \u201cleprechaun economics\u201d, while Sinn F\u00e9in MP Pearse Doherty said that the economy was now \u201cso intertwined in international tax and accounting stunts that they bring with them a serious risk\u201d. The National Treasury Management Agency, which manages Ireland\u2019s debt, said the jump was due to a number of large multinationals moving their tax domicile to Ireland. This led to a \u20ac300bn increase in the country\u2019s capital stock, which records assets such as roads and hospitals but also intangibles such as intellectual property. This pushed the value of assets above \u20ac1tn for the first time. \u201cWhether by re-domiciling or by inverting, the reclassification of several large companies as Irish resident expanded the capital stock in 2015,\u201d the agency said in a presentation in July. Since Tuesday\u2019s ruling, there has been speculation that the GDP leap may be linked to a change in Apple\u2019s offshore strategy. The commission stated that its ruling only applied to the end of 2014 because the company\u2019s two main Irish subsidiaries \u2013 Apple Sales International and Apple Operations Europe \u2013 altered their structures in 2015. If Apple has reallocated more of its intellectual property, such as patents and branding rights to Ireland, the change could explain the \u20ac300bn increase in the value of Irish assets. \u201cWe don\u2019t know that what happened in 2015 was Apple,\u201d said Coffey. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s spread across 40 companies. But the EU ruling did say that Apple restructured in 2015. We do know that a lot of intellectual property is moving to Ireland. With most companies it might be worth a couple of hundred million or a billion, there aren\u2019t many companies where it\u2019s on the scale of Apple.\u201d The speculation that a single accounting change at Apple might explain the massive swing in Ireland\u2019s GDP underlines its importance to the economy. The firm employs 6,000 staff at its European headquarters in Cork, a significant proportion of the area\u2019s 200,000 strong metropolitan population.",

Writing for the Guardian, Kroes attacked Tuesday\u2019s ruling by Margrethe Vestager, her successor as Europe\u2019s top competition watchdog. The commission found that Ireland had breached state-aid rules by allowing the California technology group to pay substantially less tax than other businesses since 1991. It made a similar ruling against Starbucks and Fiat in the Netherlands last year, and has used state-aid laws to launch ongoing investigations into Amazon and McDonald\u2019s in Luxembourg. Kroes said state-aid rules should not apply to tax matters. \u201cEU member states have a sovereign right to determine their own tax laws,\u201d she said. \u201cState aid cannot be used to rewrite those rules. However, the current state-aid investigations into tax rulings appear to do exactly that.\u201d Apple routes the majority of its European and other foreign revenues through Ireland. The commission found Apple\u2019s effective rate of corporation tax at one subsidiary in Ireland was just 0.005% of its profits in 2014 \u2013 equal to a tax bill of just \u20ac50 on each \u20ac1m of profit. Kroes is also critical of the retrospective nature of the ruling, which determined that Apple had underpaid its Irish taxes from 2003 until 2014, saying a fundamental principle of tax law is that changes do not apply to past years. She writes: \u201cYou cannot change the rules of the game through ad hoc state-aid enforcement, and then seek retroactive recovery for unpaid taxes. Doing so would be fundamentally unfair and would harm competition, growth and tax income in Europe. And it raises serious questions about legal certainty and the rule of law.\u201d The Dutch former politician, who headed the commission\u2019s competition directorate from 2004 to 2010, now sits on the public policy board of the taxi-hailing business Uber, a technology group headquartered in California. Uber uses subsidiaries in the Netherlands to shield its overseas income from United States taxes. \u201cWe all agree on the need to tackle tax avoidance, but such reform should come from a transparent legislative process within the EU and through consensus building in international fora,\u201d says Kroes. She argues that the commission\u2019s use of state-aid laws to force companies to pay more tax risks undermining the work of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), which has been pushing for more transparency around the tax paid by multinationals and ways to block the use of artificial structures designed to cut tax bills.",

    "webTitle": "UK manufacturing stages surprise rebound as Brexit shock fades - as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The day has been dominated by a raft of manufacturing PMI reports for August, providing a snapshot of the global economy. The biggest surprise came from the UK, where an unexpected and sharp rebound in the headline index suggested the shock of the Brexit vote had faded. The eurozone PMI index fell to the lowest level in three months, giving Mario Draghi and his colleagues at the European Central Bank more to think about as they gather for their next policy meeting next week. Manufacturing growth slowed in the the US according to the PMI, but only slightly. Figures out just now however show a sharper drop on the ISM measure of manufacturing - to 49.4 in August from 52.6 in July. Weaker US manufacturing is likely to dampen expectations of a September US rate hike, but more importance will be placed by investors on Friday\u2019s non-farm payrolls. The FTSE is still lagging other European markets, down 0.5% or 34 points. That\u2019s all for today. Thank you for all your comments today, please join us again tomorrow. It\u2019s America\u2019s turn for the manufacturing PMI report... The headline index dropped slightly to 52 in August from 52.9 in July, where anything above 50 signals growth. Chris Williamson, chief economist at PMI provider Markit, says the slightly slower growth is no crisis: Despite the PMI falling in August, the survey suggests the third quarter is shaping up to be the best quarter so far this year for manufacturing, with output growth picking up compared to the first half of the year on the back of improved export sales. The overall rate of expansion remains only modest, however, and the upturn fragile. Weak domestic demand remains a drag on order books. Concerns about the outlook have also resulted in a marked reduction in the rate of job creation. Manufacturing has been one of the weakest parts of the US economy in recent months, and Williamson says the latest PMI is supportive of the view that the Fed should hold rates for now: The overall sluggish pace of expansion signalled by the survey, and the slacking of inflationary pressures, provides support to those arguing that interest rates should remain on hold. US markets are subdued in early trading, opening roughly flat: Dow Jones: -0.05% at 18,393 S&amp;P 500: -0.02% at 2,171 Nasdaq: +0.09% at 5,218 Just as last week investors awaited Janet Yellen\u2019s Jackson Hole Speech, this week they await Friday\u2019s non-farm payrolls for clues over the timing of the next US rate hike. Economists polled by Reuters are expecting a 180,000 rise in August, following a 255,000 rise in July. A number in line with or better than expectations will fuel speculation that the Fed will raise rates at this month\u2019s meeting. A disappointing number will prompt speculation that the Fed will be inclined to wait until December or later. The proportion of children living in workless households dropped in the second quarter of 2016 to 11% - the lowest level on record. There were 1.4 million children living in workless households during the period, while 7 million were in working households and 3.9 million were in mixed households. The report from the Office for National Statistics showed 57.4% of all UK households were working in the second quarter, up from 55.4% a year earlier and 49.3% in Q2 of 1996. The disappearance of BHS from UK high streets continues: Neelie Kroes, the European commissioner for competition between 2004 and 2010, suggests her former colleagues have taken the wrong approach over Apple\u2019s Irish tax affairs. Writing for the Guardian, she says: Rather than pursuing a handful of countries and companies for the past, we should focus on shaping a fair tax system for the future. The controversy about state aid and tax rulings is not about whether companies pay their fair share, but where that share should be paid. That is an important question, but not one for state aid. Read the full piece: Wall Street is expected to open higher: Donald Tusk, president of the European Council, has set the tone for a meeting of EU leaders to discuss what Brexit means for the EU. Theresa May is not invited to the meeting in Bratislava on 16 September, where leaders will be talking about her and not to her. Tusk said on Thursday there would be no informal discussions with the UK over Brexit. In a statement during a visit to Luxembourg, he said: We need to discuss what Brexit means politically for the European Union. We need to talk about ourselves, the European Union, that sooner or later will be left by the UK. It is not our intention to talk about the UK in Bratislava or our negotiation strategy vis-\u00e0-vis the UK. Our position is crystal clear: there will be no negotiations without notification. This principle is enshrined in our treaties. And it is there for a reason: to protect the interests of the members of the Union that want to stay together, not the one which decides to leave. Therefore, we shall not give up on this principle. Over in the US, the number of people filing new claims for jobless benefits rose last week compared with a week earlier. There were 263,000 new claims in the week ending 27 August, 2,000 fewer than economists were expecting, but 2,000 more than the previous week. The four-week rolling average fell to 263,000 claims, from 264,000 according to the US Labor Department. Ratings agency S&amp;P says Ireland\u2019s potential \u20ac13bn windfall from Apple following the EU\u2019s controversial ruling does not alter its A+ stable rating. At first glance, the tax ruling may appear favourable for the sovereign. However, while the sums involved are significant, they will not, in our view, fundamentally change Ireland\u2019s credit metrics. There may also be downside risks should the ruling lead to weaker institutional effectiveness or compromise Ireland\u2019s economic growth outlook. Should the windfall be used entirely to reduce Ireland\u2019s general government debt burden, public debt could fall to just over 80% of GDP next year. While not insignificant, it is dwarfed by the close to 40 percentage points of GDP reduction of the debt ratio from the 135% peak in 2012, brought about by Ireland\u2019s robust economic expansion following the crisis and sizable asset sales. Even if the tax funds were eventually received, they may not be fully dedicated to public debt reduction, further reducing the potential positive impact. S&amp;P goes on to highlight the potential negatives for Ireland, including divisions within the government over the issue: The initial reaction has exposed hitherto invisible splits on the issue inside the ruling coalition, which could negatively affect the effectiveness, stability, and predictability of the sovereign\u2019s policymaking and primary institutions, which we currently assess as a credit strength. Foregoing such a significant financial windfall by appealing against it, the government\u2019s credibility could suffer in the eyes of the electorate. An appeal could also lead to a more conflicted relationship with some of Ireland\u2019s EU partners, some of which have eyed Ireland\u2019s tax policies with suspicion in the past. Finally, the EU tax ruling could come with economic risks. The fear is that the ruling undermines Ireland\u2019s attractiveness as a business location for multinational corporations, hitherto a key factor in Ireland\u2019s economic progress in recent decades. The FTSE is just about holding on to positive territory, up five points or 0.1%. Earlier gains from the miners have faded away, oil prices are dipping. The UK\u2019s leading index is lagging its counterparts in Europe, where investors are shrugging off a weaker eurozone manufacturing PMI. FTSE 100: +0.1% at 6,787 Germany\u2019s DAX: +0.5% at 10,641 France\u2019s CAC: +1% at 4,481 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: +1.7% at 17,222 Spain\u2019s IBEX: +1.7% at 8,866 Greece\u2019s ATG: +0.4% at 580 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: +0.8% at 346 Martin Beck, senior economic advisor to the EY Item Club, says the August manufacturing PMI is the latest sign that sentiment quickly recovered after taking a bashing in July in the immediate aftermath of the Brexit vote. The month-on-month change in the PMI was the joint largest in the survey\u2019s history. It follows the pattern seen in a number of other indicators where a decline in sentiment in the immediate aftermath of the vote to leave the EU was followed by a recovery, as the dust settled. But just as we cautioned against getting too carried away with the weak July reading, August\u2019s rebound should not be taken as a sign that everything is fine. Taking the survey evidence in the round, there still remains a good chance that manufacturing output saw a contraction in Q3. Monday\u2019s survey for the much larger services sector will provide a stronger steer. More reaction now to the surge in UK manufacturing in August, following a sharp drop in July in the immediate aftermath of the Brexit vote. The five-point jump in the headline PMI index to 53.3 took City economists and commentators by surprise. Stephen Cooper, head of manufacturing at KPMG UK, says the number was \u201cspectacular\u201d: The August UK PMI results are spectacular for UK manufacturing. Reports of postponed work and delayed projects being restarted, following the EU referendum, are amongst the reasons cited for the better than expected performance. The 10% fall in the value of sterling has had a marked impact on export orders too. One swallow does not a summer make, and as autumn progresses, we will see if this is a blip, or whether it\u2019s the start of a long-term trend. Lee Hopley, chief economist at EEF, the manufacturers trade body, said companies had got their mojo back: Manufacturers, unnerved in July by the referendum outcome, appear to have their mojo back in August. Today\u2019s data provides a lot of relief that manufacturing activity is still on the up. But the heightened volatility in the indicator in the last couple of months still raises questions about whether sentiment has overshot somewhat and, rather than this pace of expansion being sustained, some moderation is likely in the coming months. Philip Hammond, the new(ish) chancellor, says Britain will remain an outward-looking country, attractive to foreign companies: In a statement released to coincide with a visit to Jaguar Land Rover (owned by India\u2019s Tata), he said: As an outward-looking country, we will continue to attract companies to invest and grow in the UK, while supporting British businesses. His boss Theresa May will attend the G20 summit in China later this week, where she is expected to tell world leaders Britain is \u201copen for business\u201d and keen to forge relationships with new markets. Time to buy euros? The pound has risen sharply following the surprisingly strong August manufacturing PMI. It is up 0.9% against the euro and earlier hit a one-month high. The pound is also up 0.7% against the dollar at $1.3236. Neil Wilson, market analyst at ETX Capital: We\u2019re seeing a strong bid for sterling after a stonking manufacturing PMI showed the UK\u2019s factories sparked back into life in August following the July post-Brexit slowdown. The pound is cranking higher on the results, with cable now trading around $1.3250, its best since the Bank of England cut interest rates a month ago. The focus will now be on the key services sector PMI [on Monday]. The omens are good, with consumer spending very robust. However, let\u2019s remember that Brexit negotiations have not even begun yet so there is still plenty of time for things to turn south. The five-point jump in the headline index of the August UK manufacturing PMI was a major rebound for the sector. It was the joint biggest monthly surge in the survey\u2019s near 25-year history, and will add weight to the view that the June Brexit vote has not (yet) plunged the UK economy into crisis. Output, new orders, and employment all jumped in the sector in August. Firms taking part in the survey said stronger demand, new product launches, and customers committing to new and previously postponed contracts all boosted business. Manufacturers said the drop in the pound since the Brexit vote had driven a rise in exports, with swelling sales to overseas markets such as the US, Europe, China, Southeast Asia, the Middle East and Norway. A weak pound makes British goods cheaper abroad, which is a good for exporting businesses. But it also makes imports from other countries more expensive, and evidence of this could be seen in the August PMI. Input prices - those paid by manufacturers for their raw materials - increased at the fastest rate in more than five years in August. About 44% of firms reported a rise in purchasing costs. Factory gate inflation - the price charged by manufacturers as they leave the factory - also rose at the fastest pace for five years. Rob Dobson, senior economist at IHS Markit, says the August report suggests the sector has swerved a (Brexit-induced) downturn: The August PMI data indicate a solid rebound in the performance of the UK manufacturing sector from the steep downturn that followed the EU referendum. Companies reported that work that had been postponed during July had now been restarted, as manufacturers and their clients started to regain a sense of returning to business as usual. Inflation is raising its ugly head, however. Rates of increase in input prices and output charges both hit five-year highs, which manufacturers placed squarely at the door of the cost impact of sterling on import prices. It is too early to say whether the rebounds in growth and inflation will be sustained, but the upturn in August suggests that the weaker exchange rate and recent policy action have helped to avert a downturn. Big upside shock for UK manufacturing PMI in August. The headline index jumped to 53.3 from 48.3 in July. Economists had expected the index to remain in contraction territory (below 50) at 49. More soon. Looking at the detail of the eurozone manufacturing PMI survey, rates of growth slowed for production, new orders, and new export business, which in turn resulted in weaker job creation. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, said there were suggestions from the firms surveyed for the PMI that growth could slow further. There is some suggestion of a Brexit impact, and growth may wane further in September after new orders growth slipped to a one-and-a-half year low. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the strengthening of the euro and reduced sales to the UK were partly to blame for the order book slowdown. Employment growth also eased to a five-month low, indicating an increased hesitancy to hire amid the heightened political uncertainty. Once again, it\u2019s also a worryingly mixed picture across the region. Northern countries including Germany, the Netherlands and Austria are providing the main power to the expansion, but elsewhere the picture is looking more subdued. France and Italy are in decline, Greece is stagnating and both Spain and Ireland are enduring their worst growth spells since mid-2013. Here is a country breakdown of the headline numbers for August. Anything above 50 signals growth, anything below 50 signals contraction: Germany: 53.6 Netherlands: 53.5 Austria: 52.1 Ireland: 51.7 Spain: 51 Greece: 50.4 Italy: 49.8 France: 48.3 Activity in the eurozone\u2019s manufacturing sector grew at the slowest rate in three months in August according to the latest survey. The headline index on the Markit PMI edged down to 51.7 in August from 52 in July. Anything above 50 signals expansion. A breakdown of the surveys from the eurozone\u2019s biggest economies showed a mixed picture. In Germany, the sector grew in August at the same pace as July, as expected. It was the same story in Spain. But Italy was a miss, with the manufacturing sector shrinking unexpectedly in August, and in France the sector contracted at a slightly quicker rate than July. The price of a barrel of Brent crude oil is up 0.6% this morning at $47.19. The better-than-expected manufacturing data out of China has also pushed the prices of London zinc, lead and tin to the highest level in more than a year. China is the world\u2019s biggest user of metals. Miners on the FTSE 100 are reaping the rewards this morning: Europe\u2019s major markets are all up this morning, starting September off on a positive note. The FTSE 100 is up 43 points or 0.6%, boosted by mining shares that have been a drag in recent days. The miners are helped today by the better-than-expected Chinese manufacturing data, which is a positive for global demand and is pushing up commodity prices. FTSE 100: +0.6% at 6,823 Germany\u2019s DAX: +0.3% at 10,625 France\u2019s CAC: +0.6% at 4,464 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: +1% at 17,110 Spain\u2019s IBEX: +0.6% at 8,771 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: +0.5% at 345 Activity in China\u2019s factories rose unexpectedly in August at the fastest pace in two years as construction boomed in a sign government spending is paying off. The official purchasing managers\u2019 index rose to 50.4 in August from 49.9 in July - crucially taking the index above the 50 mark which signals growth. Economists had expected the headline index to remain unchanged at 49.9. The best manufacturing performance since late 2014 is likely to add to views that China\u2019s central bank will be in no hurry to inject further stimulus into the world\u2019s second largest economy. Julian Evans-Pritchard, China economist at Capital Economics, said the survey would boost confidence: This ought to boost sentiment and suggests that earlier policy easing is still being supportive of economic activity. Today\u2019s PMI readings paint a fairly reassuring picture about the current state of China\u2019s economy and fit with our long-running view that earlier policy stimulus ought to be sufficient to shore up growth until the end of this year. The first of the PMI surveys for August will be published today, starting with manufacturing in the eurozone, UK and US. The PMIs are business surveys rather than official data, but they are closely watched by central bankers, investors and economists, not least because they give the earliest indication of how an economy is performing. There is more of a lag with much of the official data. As we begin a new month, attention is turning to potential action by the world\u2019s central banks as they prepare for their next policy meetings. In the UK and eurozone, the likelihood is for further stimulus, whereas in the US - where economic data and the outlook has been generally more robust - attention is focused on the timing of the next rate hike. The PMI surveys will be scanned for any clues on whether policy action is more or less likely in the world\u2019s major economies. Weekly jobless claims will be published later in the US, ahead of the crucial non-farm payrolls report on Friday which is expected to give the clearest signal as to whether the US Fed will raise rates this month. European markets are expected to open higher after most indices fell on Wednesday: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Apple boss Tim Cook is still fuming over the EU\u2019s ruling earlier in the week that the US tech giant must pay the Irish government up to \u20ac13bn plus interest in back taxes. In a new interview with the Irish independent he condemns the move as \u201ctotal political crap\u201d, and repeats his vow to fight the EU. Cook suggests Apple has been specifically targeted by commissioners in Europe and that Ireland - which does not want the company to repay the money and has also pledged to appeal the ruling - is being picked on. I think we\u2019ll work very closely together, as we have the same motivation. No one did anything wrong here and we need to stand together. Ireland is being picked on and this is unacceptable. He rejects the claim by European competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager that Apple paid just 0.005pc tax in Ireland in 2014: It\u2019s total political crap. They just picked a number from I don\u2019t know where. In the year that the Commission says we paid that tax figure, we actually paid $400m. We believe that makes us the highest taxpayer in Ireland that year. This conclusion that the Commission has reached has no basis in law or in fact. So I think it clearly suggests that this is politics at play. He continues that while Apple hasn\u2019t always see eye-to-eye with the US government, they are united on this particular issue: This is a huge overreach that represents retrospective activity and is completely unfair,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s wrong. In the last several years, we\u2019ve had political differences of opinion in the US on this. But on this one, literally 100pc of the comments are in agreement. I think that Apple was targeted here,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I think that (anti-US sentiment) is one reason why we could have been targeted. People in leadership positions in several countries tell me that this is the agenda. I don\u2019t know where that comes from. But what I feel strongly about is that this decision was politically based, of that I\u2019m very confident. There is no reason for it in fact or in law. He said Apple remains fully committed to Ireland, and will repay its loyalty. We are going forward, absolutely,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to be really clear that we are very committed on Ireland. We are going to continue with the expansions we talked about. We\u2019ve been spending a lot of money on building out a large location in Cork, We have a 37-year-old marriage with Ireland and it means something to us. It\u2019s a very deep relationship. Every time I go there it brings me such joy. It is an integral part of the company. I feel like Ireland stuck with Apple when it wasn\u2019t easy to stick with Apple and now we\u2019re sticking with Ireland. A reminder of what this is all about:",

      "bodyText": "The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has called for the leaders of the world\u2019s leading economies to make a positive case for globalisation after voicing concern that prolonged slow growth and rising inequality is eroding support for free trade and open markets. In a report published before this weekend\u2019s gathering of the G20 group of developed and developing nations in China, the fund warned that slower than expected growth in the US and the knock-on impact of Brexit were likely to result in a fresh downgrade of its forecasts for global activity in 2016. While expressing relief that the financial markets had stabilised after the turmoil in the days after the UK\u2019s EU referendum on 23 June, the IMF signalled that it would be revising down its July prediction of 3.1% growth for this year when it publishes its World Economic Outlook next month. The fund\u2019s Global Prospects and Policy Challenges \u2013 prepared for the G20 meeting \u2013 said recent data had shown \u201cmuted activity, slower trade growth, and very low inflation, pointing to an even more modest pace of global growth this year. \u201cDespite record-low interest rates, investment continues to disappoint, reflecting demand conditions as well as high corporate sector debt and weak financial sector balance sheets in many countries.\u201d Christine Lagarde, the IMF\u2019s managing director, used a blog to call on the G20 to adopt a four-pronged approach that would result in more economic stimulus, structural reform, a renewed commitment to free trade and a more equitable division of the proceeds of growth. \u201cIt takes political courage to implement this agenda\u201d, Lagarde said. \u201cBut inaction risks reversing global economic integration, and therefore stalling an engine that, for decades, has created and spread wealth around the globe. This risk is, in my view, too large to take.\u201d Recent developments have led to heightened concern at the fund about the drift towards economic nationalism. Both candidates in the US presidential election have expressed opposition to the free trade deals being sought by Barack Obama. The IMF managing director said 2016 would be the fifth consecutive year in which global growth was below the 3.7% average recorded in the period from 1990 to 2007. \u201cThe political pendulum threatens to swing against economic openness, and without forceful policy actions, the world could suffer from disappointing growth for a long time.\u201d The G20 will give world leaders an opportunity to discuss the consequences of Brexit with Theresa May, who will be attending her first summit as prime minister. Although the IMF has rowed back from its forecast that the UK would go into recession following the Brexit vote, its G20 report still predicts a \u201csharp slowdown\u201d following the result of the referendum. \u201cFurther ahead, the outlook will be affected by the degree to which the future relationship with the European Union can preserve the benefits of economic integration and trade.\u201d For the world economy as a whole, the IMF said low and falling growth coupled with rising inequality made for a challenging policy backdrop. Weak prospects for growth could depress investment and slow down trade, leading to even weaker demand and limiting the scope for productivity gains. \u201cAt the same time, income growth has not only been meagre, it has bypassed low-income earners in many countries, raising anxiety about globalisation and worsening the political climate for reform.\u201d The report said there were more downside than upside risks to its forecasts, with low inflation, China\u2019s transition to an economic model less dependent on exports and the uncertainties caused by Brexit \u2013 particularly for other European countries \u2013 singled out as specific concerns. \u201cFinancial markets have largely recovered from their lows following the United Kingdom referendum, but potential weaknesses remain in the financial sector. While political uncertainty remains concerning the development of the relationship between the United Kingdom and European Union, short-term turbulence has ebbed. Bank equities remain under pressure, however, with particular tensions surrounding Italian banks.\u201d",

All the lost ground was made up in August \u2013 and then some. The closely watched Markit/Cips report recorded the joint biggest monthly increase in industry\u2019s performance in the 25-year history of the purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI), taking it to its highest level since last October.

The second conclusion is that policy decisions have made a difference. Theresa May\u2019s swift coronation and the stimulus provided by the Bank of England have made manufacturers more hopeful that they can not just survive but thrive after the referendum. Finally, while it is still early days and companies are still mulling over big hiring and investment decisions, predictions made ahead of the referendum that the economy would be plunged into an immediate recession by a vote to leave look wide of the mark.

    "webTitle": "Apple boss expects to repatriate billions to the US next year", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Apple boss Tim Cook expects the iPhone maker to repatriate huge offshore profits to America next year, paying billions of dollars in deferred taxes to the US Treasury. In an interview with RTE radio, he gave a summary of the company\u2019s 2014 tax affairs, saying: \u201cWe paid $400m [in tax] to Ireland, we paid $400m to the US. And we provisioned several billion for the US for payment as soon as we repatriated. \u201cRight now I would forecast that we repatriate next year. So it is not true that we would pay just $400m, or even just $800m, the number is materially larger.\u201d The revelation that Apple plans to repatriate some of its offshore profits and pay its huge US tax bills next year comes as a surprise given Cook\u2019s previous refusal to countenance such a move. Like many large US multinationals, Apple has for decades been pooling its non-US profits outside of America. Under loopholes in the tax laws, corporations can defer US taxes continually so long as income is not repatriated to America. In July, Apple told investors its cash pile held offshore had reached $214.8bn (\u00a3162.2bn). This is the largest of any US company. Cook\u2019s surprise U-turn on repatriating foreign profits comes days after Apple was accused by competition regulators at the European commission of receiving state aid from Ireland. The commission said billions of income had been allowed to pass through Apple\u2019s Irish-registered companies untaxed. Both Apple and Ireland have insisted they will appeal against the decision. Meanwhile, some politicians in the US have described it as a political attack. Until now, Cook had consistently said Apple would not repatriate profits to the US until Washington slashed the US tax rate. Last December, in an interview for US television programme 60 Minutes, Cook said he would \u201clove to\u201d repatriate Apple\u2019s offshore cash. Asked why he doesn\u2019t, he said: \u201cBecause it would cost me 40% to bring it home. And I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a reasonable thing to do.\u201d He then attacked the US corporate tax regime, saying: \u201cThis is a tax code made for the industrial age, not the digital age. It\u2019s backwards, it\u2019s awful for America. It should have been fixed many years ago. It is past time to get it done.\u201d In its annual report, Apple does make large provisions for US taxes, which allows it to claim that it has an effective tax rate of 26% \u2013 much higher than many other tech firms. However, behind these accounting provisions Apple has made clear it does not intend to repatriate funds and actually pay the taxes provisioned for while the US maintains its current high tax rate. For that reason, the group\u2019s reported tax rate is regarded by experts as an accounting fiction. The US has a federal tax rate of 35% on corporate profits \u2013 one of the highest in the world\u2013 on top of which businesses can end up paying an additional sum of about 5% in local state taxes. In reality, loopholes in the US tax code allow American multinationals to aggressively defer tax payments so long as any income earned outside the US is kept offshore. That allows many companies, particularly tech firms, to achieve some of the lowest effective tax rates in the world.",

Both Apple and Ireland have insisted they will appeal against the decision. Meanwhile, some politicians in the US have described it as a political attack.</p> <p>Until now, Cook had consistently said Apple would not repatriate profits to the US until Washington slashed the US tax rate. </p> <p>Last December, in an <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX0XvEu7_cg\">interview for US television programme 60 Minutes</a>, Cook said he would \u201clove to\u201d repatriate Apple\u2019s offshore cash. Asked why he doesn\u2019t, he said: \u201cBecause it would cost me 40% to bring it home. And I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a reasonable thing to do.\u201d </p> <p> He then attacked the US corporate tax regime, saying: \u201cThis is a tax code made for the industrial age, not the digital age. It\u2019s backwards, it\u2019s awful for America. It should have been fixed many years ago. It is past time to get it done.\u201d </p> <p>In its annual report, Apple does make large provisions for US taxes, which allows it to claim that it has an effective tax rate of 26% \u2013 much higher than many other tech firms. </p> <p>However, behind these accounting provisions Apple has made clear it does not intend to repatriate funds and actually pay the taxes provisioned for while the US maintains its current high tax rate. For that reason, the group\u2019s reported tax rate is regarded by experts as an accounting fiction.</p> <p>The US has a federal tax rate of 35% on corporate profits \u2013 one of the highest in the world\u2013 on top of which businesses can end up paying an additional sum of about 5% in local state taxes. </p> <p>In reality, loopholes in the US tax code allow American multinationals to aggressively defer tax payments so long as any income earned outside the US is kept offshore. That allows many companies, particularly tech firms, to achieve some of the lowest effective tax rates in the world.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s factories saw a strong rebound in output and new orders in August, according to a survey that suggested manufacturers quickly shrugged off the shock of June\u2019s vote to leave the EU. A closely watched measure of factory activity swung to a 10-month high in August from a 41-month low recorded in July. But there were signs a weaker pound was stoking inflation, as it raised the cost of imported materials for UK factories and they passed those higher costs on to customers. The Markit/Cips UK Manufacturing PMI (pdf) rose to 53.3 in August from 48.3 in July. That was the joint greatest month-to-month jump in the survey\u2019s nearly 25-year history. The last time there was a five-point jump was between February 2009 and March 2009 in the aftermath of the global financial crisis. The latest reading was well above the 50-mark separating growth from contraction and far ahead of the consensus forecast for a reading of 49.0, in a Reuters poll of economists. The pound strengthened against the US dollar and hit a one-month high against the euro after the stronger than expected report. City analysts have already been adjusting their outlooks for a post-referendum slump on the back of indicators showing household spending has held up well. These latest figures are likely to prompt more economists to shift to a brighter outlook for the UK economy over coming months. Rob Dobson, senior economist at the manufacturing report\u2019s compilers IHS Markit, said: \u201cThe August PMI data indicate a solid rebound in the performance of the UK manufacturing sector from the steep downturn that followed the EU referendum. \u201cCompanies reported that work that had been postponed during July had now been restarted, as manufacturers and their clients started to regain a sense of returning to business as usual. The domestic market showed a marked recovery, especially for consumer products, while the recent depreciation of sterling drove higher inflows of new business from the US, Europe, Scandinavia, the Middle East and Asia.\u201d The survey of purchasing managers at more than 600 industrial companies showed: Output recovered at one of the fastest paces on record. New orders enjoyed one of the strongest month-to-month rebounds. Manufacturing production grew at the fastest pace in seven months. Companies reported solid inflows of new work from domestic and export customers. New export business grew at the fastest pace for 26 months. Input price inflation hit a five-year high. Output prices also rose at the fastest pace for five years. And employment rose for the first time this year. \u201cInflation is raising its ugly head,\u201d said Dobson, commenting on the effects of the pound falling against other currencies, which makes UK imports more expensive but exports more competitive. \u201cIt is too early to say whether the rebounds in growth and inflation will be sustained, but the upturn in August suggests that the weaker exchange rate and recent policy action have helped to avert a downturn,\u201d he added. The rebound for manufacturers follows action by the Bank of England to restore confidence among businesses and households after the 23 June referendum. The Bank cut interest rates to a new record low of 0.25% and expanded its programme of electronic money creation, known as quantitative easing, on 4 August. That followed a warning from Bank governor Mark Carney before the referendum that a vote to leave could tip the UK into recession. Economists have warned that despite signs of a rebound this summer, the decision to leave the EU could be felt more acutely once negotiations to leave the bloc begin in earnest. Lee Hopley, chief economist at the EEF manufacturers\u2019 organisation, said the news \u201cprovides a lot of relief that manufacturing activity is still on the up\u201d but that August\u2019s performance was unlikely to be sustained. \u201cManufacturers, unnerved in July by the referendum outcome, appear to have their mojo back in August,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the heightened volatility in the indicator in the last couple of months still raises questions about whether sentiment has overshot somewhat and, rather than this pace of expansion being sustained, some moderation is likely in the coming months.\u201d Economists are awaiting the purchasing managers\u2019 index report for the smaller construction sector on Friday and, more importantly, for the much larger services sector on Monday.",
