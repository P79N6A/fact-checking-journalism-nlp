      "bodyText": "The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) seems to be on another planet in its allegations against the Showmen\u2019s Guild of Great Britain (Watchdog: unfair trade body could be stifling competition, 22 December). Its provisional findings would appear to have been reached without any serious consideration of the history of fairs in this country and the environment in which travelling showmen operate. How many fairs did they actually visit during their deliberations \u2013 or were they all conducted in splendid, ideologically bound isolation? Their conclusions certainly do not bear any relationship to reality on the fairground. Contrary to their suggestion, there is always pressure \u201cto provide different or new attractions\u201d \u2013 and it comes from the fairgoers, who from time immemorial have always looked for novelty at the annual fair. The travelling showman is acutely aware of this and has always sought to satisfy this demand. But he can only reinvest in his business if he has the sort of security and stability that the 127-year-old Showmen\u2019s Guild has been able to offer its members through its regulations. These regulations, it should be said, are democratically agreed by its members and have always been subject to revision in light of changing economic and social circumstances. In addition to the benefits conferred on its own members, the guild also provides organisations such as local authorities (and ultimately all fairgoers) with the assurance that its members comply with more socially important considerations including strict fairground safety requirements. Some of the guild\u2019s regulations the CMA criticises were actually introduced to bring greater order to the fairground industry at a time when unfettered competition was resulting in unseemly incidents that were a credit to no one. The rules of the Showmen\u2019s Guild have a strong, ethical basis: a fact that is due in large measure to the influence of its first full-time general secretary, the Reverend Thomas Horne, a clergyman who had long campaigned on the showmen\u2019s behalf.

      "bodyText": "The shortfall in productivity compared with other developed economies has long been Britain\u2019s economic achilles heel. It is a problem that Conservative and Labour chancellors have been grappling with for decades. Productivity is a guide to how good a country is at delivering the goods and services that are bought and sold. Technically, it is the rate of output per unit of input, measured per worker or by the number of hours worked. In layman\u2019s terms, it is a measure of what goes in and what comes out. In some sectors, productivity is easy to measure. A factory that makes 1,000 cars a day with 50 workers is twice as productive as a factory that requires 100 workers to do the same job. In other parts of the economy, assessing whether productivity has improved is harder and less objective. At face value a fast-food joint that employed the same number of chefs to cook the same number of hamburgers as they did a year earlier would not be showing any increase in productivity. But if the quality of the hamburgers improved, that would be a productivity gain and statisticians would try to capture the improvement in the official figures. There are a number of ways in which a firm can make itself more productive. It can invest in new machinery that makes the production process more efficient. It can employ more highly skilled staff. It can train workers so that they can fully exploit the equipment they are using. It is through productivity improvements that living standards rise. For many years, the annual increase in productivity in the UK averaged around 2%, although there were periods when it was lower and periods when it was higher. Each year since the early 1990s, the Office for National Statistics has published an international comparison of productivity. This showed that UK productivity was 9% lower than the average of the other six members of the G7 (the US, Japan, Germany, France, Italy and Canada) but this gap narrowed to 4% by the time of the 2007 financial crisis. Since then, however, productivity in the UK has barely grown and the gap with the rest of the G7 has widened to 18%. The gap with Germany is 35% and with the US 30%. There have been a number of explanations for the dramatic deterioration in productivity: the availability of unskilled cheap labour has deterred firms from investment; the poor quality of UK roads, railways and broadband network; the shrinkage of the financial sector, which had been a source of high-productivity jobs in the boom before the 2007 crisis; and the misallocation of capital to \u201czombie\u201d firms kept alive by ultra-low interest rates rather than to dynamic new enterprises. The government\u2019s autumn statement document states that improving productivity is the \u201ccentral long-term economic challenge\u201d for the UK. Philip Hammond, the chancellor, has identified better infrastructure, technology and skills as the foundations for doing so, which is why he unveiled a new \u00a323bn national productivity investment fund and backed Sir Charlie Mayfield\u2019s productivity council in his autumn statement. But this is a goal that requires long-term investment and commitment.",

    "webTitle": "John Lewis boss: higher minimum wage should boost productivity", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The boss of John Lewis and Waitrose has said the introduction of the \u201cnational living wage\u201d could already be boosting productivity in Britain, despite criticism of the policy by senior retail figures. Sir Charlie Mayfield, chairman of the John Lewis Partnership and a government adviser on productivity, told the Guardian that the national living wage could be a \u201cspur to productivity\u201d because it could encourage more use of automation in workplaces. That could lead to fewer jobs in some industries, Mayfield admitted, but would also spur stronger economic growth. \u201cI think we will see automation happening faster. It would be wrong to say that the national living wage is going to create a great increase in automation in sectors like retail, but it will be a contributing factor to an acceleration of automation in some sectors and it will have impact on employment levels,\u201d he said. The national living wage came into force in April and means companies must pay staff aged 25 at least \u00a37.20 an hour. However, retailers warned it could lead to job losses, with Dave Lewis, the boss of Tesco, saying it was part of a \u201cpotentially lethal cocktail\u201d of costs facing the industry. Mayfield warned last year that it would lead to a rise in unemployment if productivity did not improve in Britain. Mayfield is now leading an initiative, which received \u00a313m in government funding this year, to try to improve productivity by boosting management skills. He said regulation was a \u201cblunt instrument\u201d for improving productivity but that the national living wage could lead to automation being introduced earlier. The John Lewis chairman added that greater use of technology would ultimately boost the economy. \u201cYou can\u2019t really generalise and say this is a recipe for fewer jobs across the country. I think what you can say is that over time if the country is more productive we will create more employment and higher paid employment than the alternative, which is that our competitiveness declines.\u201d Mayfield added that, as well as being a spur to productivity, the policy should be welcomed for attempting to address the UK\u2019s low wage economy. \u201cI think the national living wage will be a spur to productivity. I think that will already be happening,\u201d he said. \u201cI do agree with one of the underlying intents of the national living wage which is to say: \u2018We can\u2019t afford as a country to be a low wage economy.\u2019\u201d Mayfield said the threat of job losses from automation would vary from sector to sector. \u201cDifferent sectors will be affected differently, so the consequence of the Nissan plant in Sunderland being one of the most productive in the world is they are going to be making more cars and more jobs,\u201d he said. \u201cEqually, there will be sectors and companies that are more in a remedial situation. Or indeed where the technology that is available to them has shifted so significantly that they can re-engineer in a much more dramatic way how they carry out current operations. There will be instances where that will lead to fewer jobs.\u201d Mayfield\u2019s productivity council will work on sharing information between businesses and developing tools that allow bosses to measure the health of their company. The John Lewis boss is now looking to make key appointments to the council and roll out an app called \u201cHow good is your business really?\u201d which allows businesses to conduct self-assessments. Britain\u2019s productivity problem is dragging down pay and living standards, but Mayfield says it is an issue that is discussed in the \u201cWestminster bubble\u201d rather than businesses themselves. One of the main challenges for his new productivity council will be to transform productivity into a relevant and aspirational target for businesses by linking it to key financial metrics such as sales, profits and cash flow. \u201cAs a retailer we measure everything so we have a number of different ways of measuring productivity, but the one we are focusing on much more now is profit per partner,\u201d Mayfield says of the John Lewis Partnership, which is owned by its employees. \u201cWhat we recognise is that we need to improve our profit per partner to make our business successful in the future. We are actually by most measures a very productive retail business, however the sector is facing some structural and significant challenges, which means even a very good performing business in the retail sector has to improve its productivity in order to thrive and prosper. \u201cTechnology is clearly integral to this and the way that we are investing in technology is going to be hugely important.\u201d Philip Hammond, the chancellor, outlined Britain\u2019s productivity problem in stark terms in the autumn statement by saying it took a British worker five days to produce something that their German counterpart could do in four. Mayfield said the management skills he would be encouraging, which were used at John Lewis, were \u201cnot rocket science\u201d. \u201cIt is having clear objectives, measuring them, doing appraisals, giving feedback \u2013 these things. It is surprising how the incidence of businesses exhibiting those practices is relatively low,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a constant focus for us [at John Lewis] and we spend a lot of time actually thinking about how we enhance performance and how we enhance productivity. If you looked at our strategy documents you would find those kinds of things would feature pretty prominently within them, because it is not a question of being in the slightest bit complacent; it\u2019s about constantly looking for improvement.\u201d",

We are actually by most measures a very productive retail business, however the sector is facing some structural and significant challenges, which means even a very good performing business in the retail sector has to improve its productivity in order to thrive and prosper.<br></p> <p>\u201cTechnology is clearly integral to this and the way that we are investing in technology is going to be hugely important.\u201d</p> <p>Philip Hammond, the chancellor, outlined Britain\u2019s productivity problem in stark terms in the autumn statement by saying it took a British worker five days to produce something that their German counterpart could do in four. </p> <p>Mayfield said the management skills he would be encouraging, which were used at John Lewis, were \u201cnot rocket science\u201d.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cIt is having clear objectives, measuring them, doing appraisals, giving feedback \u2013 these things. It is surprising how the incidence of businesses exhibiting those practices is relatively low,\u201d he said.<br></p> <p>\u201cThis is a constant focus for us [at John Lewis] and we spend a lot of time actually thinking about how we enhance performance and how we enhance productivity. If you looked at our strategy documents you would find those kinds of things would feature pretty prominently within them, because it is not a question of being in the slightest bit complacent; it\u2019s about constantly looking for improvement.\u201d</p> <p></p> <p></p>",
