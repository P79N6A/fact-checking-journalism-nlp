      "bodyText": "North Sea tax receipts have plunged into the red for the first time in the sector\u2019s history after the steep decline in global oil prices. HM Revenue and Customs figures show that offshore corporation tax receipts for April to September were only \u00a3203m, compared with a six-monthly peak of \u00a33.3bn in 2011. Petroleum revenue taxes for those six months stood at -\u00a3242m, compared with periods where PRT raised \u00a3577m in a single month. The latest figures for the most important North Sea tax revenues \u2013 corporation tax and petroleum revenue tax \u2013 show the sector effectively cost the taxpayer \u00a339m over the first six months of this financial year. Excluding other minor tax receipts, which will be calculated by the Treasury at the end of the financial year and may see a small overall surplus, the North Sea generated negative tax receipts from April to September after oil prices again crashed to as low as $43 (\u00a328) a barrel. The new data has shattered the most recent official forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility, which had predicted in July the sector would generate \u00a3700m for the Treasury this year, and undermined even more optimistic predictions by the Scottish government. John McLaren, an economist and honorary professor at Adam Smith business school at Glasgow university, said: \u201cIt may be the first time there has been a negative tax take over a six-month period and means it will be very difficult to attain even that \u00a3700m figure, which itself is much revised down from a year ago.\u201d McLaren added that the latest data reinforced the fact that this was \u201cnearing the end of the North Sea as a source of revenue\u201d for the government. \u201cReally, its future importance is in maintaining economic activity and retaining jobs,\u201d he said. The figures imply that the sector will generate modest tax receipts this year, only 12 months after the Scottish National party promised voters North Sea oil would help fund independence. Scottish public spending far exceeds its tax revenues, with spending about \u00a31,300 per head greater than the UK average. The Scottish government\u2019s independence white paper released in November 2013 claimed that oil revenues for Scotland \u2013 which has a 90% geographical share of North Sea receipts \u2013 could hit \u00a37.9bn in the financial year 2016/17 alone. That figure was based on a $113-a-barrel oil price. But, in June this year, after the first oil price slump to $40 a barrel, the Scottish government admitted that tax revenues would fall sharply for 2015. Scottish ministers urged the UK government to cut taxes and levies, and increase tax allowances, to help it limp through the crisis. Fergus Ewing, the Scottish energy minister, declined to make any statement on the fiscal impact of the negative tax revenues but confirmed that his SNP administration supported the UK government\u2019s tax cuts and subsidies. He said those changes would eventually see the sector return to better health. \u201cThe fiscal reforms from the UK government, which the Scottish government has long called for, will encourage additional production and investment that will boost government revenues in the coming years,\u201d Ewing said. Recent data suggested production was increasing, adding to the potential for higher tax receipts in future. A senior Conservative party source said the UK government was likely to forgo billions of pounds in taxation and in tax incentives for the sector to help it survive the slump in prices and the financial challenges posed by decommissioning old platforms. \u201cOnce again, this demonstrates the benefit of pooling resources and sharing risks across the UK and how the UK and Scottish government working together can best support one of our major sectors in the years and decades ahead,\u201d he said. Jackie Baillie, Scottish Labour\u2019s public services spokeswoman, said it was \u201cremarkable\u201d that the sector had effectively cost taxpayers money for the first time, adding that it raised challenging questions for the SNP\u2019s promises during the independence referendum. \u201cThe dramatic collapse in the oil price, and the devastating impact this would have had on our ability to pay for schools and hospitals, shows we made the right decision to keep Scotland in the UK and reject the SNP\u2019s fantasy economics,\u201d she said. \u201cThe SNP government need to be transparent about Scotland\u2019s finances and the impact falling oil revenues has.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The supermarket chain Morrisons is pulling out of a sustainable farming project in which it has invested \u00a32m over the last five years. The struggling retailer took over the running of a 1,000-acre estate belonging to Dumfries House in Ayrshire in 2009 after the stately home was saved for the nation by a charitable consortium led by Prince Charles. The prince took out a \u00a320m personal loan in 2007 to prevent its sale and its unique collection of furniture being broken up. The then Morrisons chief executive, Dalton Philips, launched a major investment programme in a \u201cliving laboratory\u201d to investigate sustainable methods of meat production in 2010. He hoped the farm, which was set up to examine how to increase the amount of meat produced per hectare and how breeding and feeding techniques can reduce methane emissions from cows, would be profitable by last year. A spokesperson for Dumfries House said its partnership with the supermarket would end next month after \u201ca repositioning and a change in priorities for Morrisons\u201d. \u201cWe are indebted to Morrisons for the hard work and investment put into developing the farming operation. Now that the estate has developed and the project is more stable, this seems the right time to bring the farm back under the direct management of Dumfries House,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cDumfries House is now a growing visitor attraction and it makes sense to reincorporate the farm back into the day-to-day management of the estate.\u201d The change comes after the retailer \u2013 where profits almost halved in the first half of this year \u2013 has laid off thousands of staff and shut underperforming stores as it tries to rein in costs amid a tough grocery market. Leading supermarkets are under pressure as they are forced to slash prices to compete with the rise of discounters Aldi and Lidl while coping with a switch in shopping habits towards the internet and small local stores. The Morrisons group corporate services director, Martyn Jones, said: \u201cThe Dumfries House project was an exceptional opportunity for us to explore and develop farming practices. We are pleased with our achievements at the farm including developing our signature beef specification and creating best practice guidance for our suppliers. We will take the learning and development knowledge gained from Dumfries to progress our sustainable livestock programme with our existing farmer supply base.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "China and the UK have signed almost \u00a340bn worth of deals that David Cameron said would create thousands of jobs and make Britain Beijing\u2019s partner of choice. \u201cWhat this really means is jobs, it means livelihoods, it means security,\u201d he told the UK-China Business Summit held at London\u2019s Mansion House on Wednesday. The prime minister said he was determined to build a stronger relationship with China during his time in No 10, based on a relationship with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, that dates back to 2007 when the pair promised to \u201cnurture and develop\u201d links between the two nations. \u201cThe deals that have been done during this visit cement what is a growing partnership,\u201d he said. \u201cThis visit is taking our relationship to the next level and I want to ensure that our cooperation and partnership means we can support each other to deliver the growth and the jobs that we both want \u2013 to make sure that the trade and investment flows both ways along the modern equivalent of the Silk Road.\u201d Among the deals signed during the four-day state visit by Xi is a \u00a350m investment by Chinese carmaker Geely, which owns the London Taxi Company, to build a new fleet of zero-emission black cabs. Another deal involves Aston Martin agreeing to spend \u00a350m with China Equity to develop its electric Rapide S sports car. Cameron said he was looking forward to Rolls-Royce appointing new apprentices after signing a deal worth \u00a31.4bn to design new jet engines. \u201cI\u2019m clear that the UK is China\u2019s best partner in the west,\u201d he added. The largest single deal remained China\u2019s commitment to buy a \u00a36bn stake in the Hinkley Point nuclear power station, though a \u00a32.6bn contract with Carnival, the world\u2019s largest cruise ship operator, to make new ships, and a \u00a31.7bn agreement with Chinese developer Advanced Business Park to redevelop a 35-acre site at the Royal Albert docks in east London and create up to 30,000 jobs, were also among the near \u00a340bn of initiatives. Xi has brushed aside concerns about his country\u2019s faltering economy, telling an audience of business leaders in London that it would remain the powerhouse of the global economy. He said \u201ca ray of sunshine was dawning on the world economy\u201d and \u201cgrowth remains the trend and will not be altered by fluctuations in global markets\u201d. Speaking at the Mansion House during a landmark China-UK trade conference, also attended by Cameron, Xi said China had entered \u201ca new normal\u201d based on an open economy susceptible to volatile international pressures. \u201cThere will be no turning back. We will stick to our win-win strategy of opening up the economy and China\u2019s markets,\u201d he said, adding that growth was important but also the quality of growth. Xi told the summit there was enormous potential for trade with his country, which is expected to import around $10tn worth of goods and invest more than $500bn overseas over the next five years. The president said Britain and China must now work to \u201cdeepen mutual trust\u201d, deliver some tangible results off the back of the new relationship and \u201csynergise\u201d development strategies. He added: \u201cWe are deeply impressed by the strong will and positive stance of the UK to grow relations and cooperation with China.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Prime minister David Cameron has told the UK-China business summit at the Mansion House in London that the \u00a340bn of deals with China means \u201cjobs, it means livelihoods, it means security.\u201d PA reports: Cameron said he had been \u201cdetermined\u201d to build a stronger relationship with China during his time in No 10 but told how his relationship with Mr Xi dated back to 2007 when the pair promised to \u201cnurture and develop\u201d links between the two nations. \u201cThe deals that have been done during this visit cement what is a growing partnership,\u201d he said. \u201cThis visit is taking our relationship to the next level and I want to ensure that our cooperation and partnership means we can support each other to deliver the growth and the jobs that we both want, to make sure that the trade and investment flows both ways along the modern equivalent of the Silk Road.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m clear that the UK is China\u2019s best partner in the West,\u201d he added. Mr Xi told the summit there was \u201cenormous\u201d potential for trade with his country, which is expected to import around ten trillion US dollars worth of goods and invest more than 500 billion US dollars overseas over the next five years. The president said Britain and China must now work to \u201cdeepen mutual trust\u201d, deliver some tangible results off the back of the new relationship and \u201csynergise\u201d development strategies. He added: \u201cWe are deeply impressed by the strong will and positive stance of the UK to grow relations and cooperation with China.\u201d On that note, it\u2019s time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Downing Street has confirmed that Mr Cameron raised human rights issues with Mr Xi but would not go into the specific concerns he had, according to PA. Mr Cameron\u2019s spokeswoman said: \u201cThe Prime Minister raised the issue of human rights, the importance of countries working together to address issues, to talk about the importance of what this means as countries develop and move forwards.\u201d Dissident Chinese artist Ai Weiwei called on David Cameron to raise the issue of human rights in his continuing talks with president Xi Jinping. He told Sky News: \u201cI think the British Prime Minister has had a record on putting human rights aside which is very bad strategy and also is a very bad aesthetics, because this certainly doesn\u2019t represent the British people. \u201cWhen [people in China] see Mr Cameron not put human rights as an issue, (that) will make people very disappointed.\u201d Here\u2019s some video of David Cameron unveiling the Hinkley Point deal: Britain and China have signed deals worth around \u00a340bn, Reuters is reporting. Prime Minister David Cameron told business leaders: \u201cOne of the foremost elements of this visit is the huge number of commercial deals that we are signing, totalling almost \u00a340bn.\u201d He pointed to a \u00a31.4bn deal for Rolls-Royce, as well as oil and gas deals worth more than \u00a312bn, including one with BP. Meanwhile Chinese president Xi Jinping said some emerging markets were facing a slowdown in growth but still enjoyed sound economic foundations. Investors had been increasingly concerned about a slowdown in China after years of strong growth, and its effect on the rest of the global economy. Xi Jinping said China was entering a new normal in its economic development. The country does face some downward pressure, but a growth rate of around 7% would suffice. He said there would be no hard landing. What do the locals think of the Hinkley Point deal with the Chinese? Steven Morris has been finding out: Prime minister David Cameron also announced a new fund to support research into \u201canti-microbial resistance\u201d and said the talks with Chinese president Xi Jinping had also touched on issues such as closer cooperation on global poverty, African development and women\u2019s rights. The UK government says the Hinkley Point deal will create up to 25,000 jobs, up to 1,000 apprentices and also provide billions of pounds worth of supply chain contracts. The official release is here: Hinkley Point C to power six million UK homes China has been under pressure for its human rights record and UK prime minister David Cameron had been urged to raise the matter during this week\u2019s meetings with president Xi Jinping. As it turned out, a large part of the - fairly brief - press conference saw president Xi Jinping addressing the issue. He said China attached great importance to the protection of human rights and had found a path suitable for China\u2019s current conditions. But he said there was \u201calways room for improvement.\u201d Cameron said the UK needed a strong economic and trade relationship with China so that the two sides could have frank discussions about other issues such as human rights. He said: \u201cI would completely reject the premise that either you can have an exchange with China about the issue of steel - or indeed about human rights - or you can have a strong relationship with China which is good for business, investment and growth...My argument, and my contention after five years of doing this job, is that you can have both. Indeed you must have both.\u201d And now a question about the UK\u2019s northern powerhouse from a Chinese journalist: Xi says he\u2019s interested to visit Manchester tomorrow: Cameron adds: One of the points of these in depth discussions is to better understand each others economies. And with that - just one question from a journalist from each country - they are gone. The second part of the BBC\u2019s question about China\u2019s human rights record was primarily addressed to President Xi. Xi does not immediately tackle this but says: I want to answer the steel question. The world is seeing an oversupply [of steel] following the financial crisis. China also has overcapacity. We have taken a series of steps [to remedy this]. We have cut 700m tonnes of production capacity. You can imagine the task of finding jobs for those workers. The UK is an important partner for China. Our investment [in the UK reached] 12.8bn RMB by 2014. Our future investments will create further jobs. We want to avoid protectionist measures. Coming to the human rights issue, China attaches create importance to human rights. We have found a path suited to China\u2019s conditions. There is always room for improvement in the world. China is ready to increase co-operation with UK and other countries over human rights. Questions. BBC - if you were a steelworker losing their job, at same time as seeing the Chinese president in a golden carriage, what would you think? What about China\u2019s human rights record? Cameron: We discussed the importance of steel industry, problem of global oversupply. China has plans to reduce oversupply. The stronger our relationship, the more able we are to have discussions about other issues. We will take action here in the UK, on energy costs, securing projects. The investment we have announced here today will [use] British steel. We are building Crossrail using almost exclusively British steel. I reject the [premise] that you either have a conversation on human rights and steel or you have strong relationship. I want both. Now Xi Jinping is speaking. I was deeply impressed by the pageantry and warmth displayed yesterday. A meeting with the prime minister agreed a global strategic partnership and to open up a golden era and jointly create a brighter future. During the visit we achieved a string of outcomes... including the Hinkley Point deal. This is a flagship project between the two countries. [Among other business deals] China will issue in London RMB sovereign bond for first time. Let\u2019s seize the opportunity .. to bring more benefits to our countries. A relationship fit for the 21st century, benefiting our people and the wider world. We discussed the excess supply of steel and how we can tackle it. We are able to have discussions about more difficult issues such as cyber and human rights. David Cameron is now giving a press conference. I want to see more trade flowing between our countries. I am pleased to announce an historic deal [to build Hinkley Point} So business leaders and unions have welcomed the Hinkley Point nuclear deal, Labour and the Green Party are not happy. Also criticising the deal - again not surprisingly - is Greenpeace. Its chief scientist Dr Doug Parr said: \u201cWith this deal George Osborne is not so much backing the wrong horse as betting billions of consumers\u2019 money on a nag running backwards. \u201cThere\u2019s no end in sight for the nuclear industry\u2019s dependence on billion-pound handouts whilst the renewable sector is on the verge of going subsidy free. Backing the former and punishing the latter makes no economic sense whatsoever. \u201cOur grandchildren will one day wonder why their bills are propping up a foreign-owned, outdated, and costly nuclear industry instead of supporting cutting-edge UK firms producing cheap clean energy.\u201d Lisa Nandy, shadow energy and climate change secretary, expressed concerns about the cost of the project, and said she had written to the Public Accounts Committee to ask them to look at the terms of the deal in detail. She said: \u201cThere are real fears about what this deal will mean for family budgets, and for our national security too. \u201cThese concerns must be addressed before a final investment agreement is made. \u201cHinkley Point C is likely to be the most expensive power station ever built anywhere and it is largely families and business who are picking up the tab. \u201cI\u2019m deeply concerned about the costs for households, and particularly vulnerable groups like pensioners.\u201d That is why I have written to the Public Accounts Committee and asked them to scrutinize in detail the terms of the agreement ministers have reached.\u201d Another to greet the deal warmly was Phil Whitehurst, national officer of the GMB union, who said: \u201cWe welcome this financing for Hinkley Point C as another piece of the jigsaw in place for a project with 25,000 job opportunities, 1,000 apprenticeships and 60% of the construction cost going to UK companies. \u201cThe UK needs nuclear power to provide low-carbon base load electricity to keep the lights on the eight to 10 days per month when renewables are not generating power for the grid.\u201d But the GMB said it would continue to campaign against giving the go-ahead for Chinese nuclear technology to be used in a new nuclear power station at Bradwell. But Simon Walker, director general of the Institute of Directors, said: \u201cIf we are to keep the lights on, wean ourselves off fossil fuels and meet global climate change targets, nuclear energy has a vital role to play in our economy. \u201cIt is clean, safe and secure, and the construction of power plants creates thousands of high-skill jobs and apprenticeships.\u201d Proponents of renewable energy have also - unsurprisingly - attacked the Hinkley Point deal. Paul McCullagh, chief executive of renewable business UrbanWind, said: [For the government] to suggest that renewable energy subsidies were axed due to the impact they had on homeowner\u2019s energy bills, and then to agree a strike price more than twice the current wholesale price for electricity generated by Hinkley Point, seems utterly backwards. Rather than supporting technologies, such as onshore wind and solar, that are readily deployable, popular with the public and increasingly cost-competitive, the Government has chosen to back a generation method that is ten years away, at best. On top of that, it comes at a price that will almost certainly increase energy bills for homes and businesses alike. National Grid have already warned that the chance of blackouts this winter will be the highest for a decade. If we experience an unexpected further outage, like we did last year with the unexpected closure of two EDF nuclear power stations over safety fears, then we could face big problems meeting demand. A new nuclear power station that is ten years or more away is not going to be much help. We\u2019ve done a Q&amp;A on the key issues surrounding the Hinckley Point deal: Not everyone of course is happy with the deal, due to be signed shortly in the presence of David Cameron. The Green Party for one. Green MEP Molly Scott Cato MEP called it a \u201cnational disgrace\u201d and said the party would continue to oppose it: This is a terrible deal which will result in the world\u2019s most expensive power plant and massively overpriced electricity. .. This is all the more tragic as we know renewable energy can deliver energy security more quickly, more cheaply and provide thousands more quality jobs. Hinkley still has a number of hurdles to jump, despite this deal. We will continue to oppose this white elephant every step of the way. Here is our full report: The cost of building the new power station has risen by \u00a32bn. Under the terms of the deal, the Chinese firm is taking a 33.5% stake in Hinkley Point in exchange for \u00a36bn of funding with the rest owned by EDF. BREAKING NEWS EDF and Chinese firm China General Nuclear Power have confirmed a deal to build a new nuclear power station at Hinkley Point in Somerset. The deal is expected to be signed shortly. Wall Street has opened higher, with the Dow Jones rising 39 points, or 0.2%, to 17,256. The Nasdaq has opened 0.5% higher while the S&amp;P 500 is up 0.3%. Fiat Chrysler boss Sergio Marchionni has just rung the opening bell on the New York Stock Exchange, with Ferrari\u2019s prancing horse logo displayed prominently behind him. Ferrari shares will trade under the ticker RACE. In about 15 minutes, Ferrari shares will start trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Marc Sanders, partner at Dutch tax adviory firm Taxand Netherlands, told PA the EU ruling would \u201crock the corporate world to its very core\u201d. He added: \u201cWhilst multinationals were lured to EU states with offers of low tax rates as an incentive, little did they know that, despite having agreement at the highest national level, this would come back and bite a decade later.\u201d Anders Dahlbeck, of ActionAid, described the tax rulings as \u201cjust the tip of the iceberg when it comes to corporate tax breaks\u201d. The international NGO estimates that developing countries lose at least $138bn a year to special tax breaks. The EU is right to act against sweetheart deals which allow multinational companies to avoid millions in tax but this only addresses part of the problem of international taxation. These sweetheart deals in Europe and developing countries are part of a race to the bottom on tax which hits the poorest hardest and leaves healthcare, schools and other key public services starved of resources.\u201d We need a fairer global tax system which tackles tax breaks in Europe and developing countries, ends the race to the bottom on tax and supports developing countries to find a sustainable route out of poverty.\u201d Margrethe Vestager\u2019s boss is, of course, European commission president Jean-Claude Juncker, who was Luxembourg\u2019s prime minister and finance minister when the tax dodging deals were struck. He has claimed he was not involved. Speaking the European Parliament in September, Juncker said: \u201cThe fight against tax avoidance and evasion is one of the Commission\u2019s top 10 priorities.\u201d He added that he felt he had \u201ca duty to fight tax evasion and avoidance.\u201d He was strongly critical of the current system, labelling it \u201cunusable and unjust\u201d with \u201cmultinational companies extremely adept at making use of differing tax rules in EU countries.\u201d But he also stressed the need to balance the crackdown on corporate tax avoidance with boosting investment in the EU. He said: \u201cthere is a need to generate greater growth and investment given the current lack of investment, however, company taxation should not act as a break on investment.\u201d Oxfam welcomes today\u2019s EU tax rulings. The charity is urging that this should be seen as the start, and not the end, of a process to stop such practices to avoid tax, and is calling on the European Commission to launch a comprehensive investigation into the 350 cases of corporate tax avoidance revealed during last year\u2019s LuxLeaks scandal. Oxfam\u2019s head of campaigns Nick Bryer said: It\u2019s high time that the European Union stood up to Starbucks, Fiat and other multinational corporations which are attempting to dodge paying their fair share in taxes and the Member States which help them. Companies like Starbucks and Fiat will continue to play the system unless the European Commission and Member States work together to close tax loopholes and punish those who break the rules. It\u2019s not just rich countries that lose out to tax dodging, it costs people in poor countries billions every year that could help to pay for desperately needed schools and hospitals. The work undertaken so far is a first step, but only with a full investigation can the European Commission start to restore European citizens\u2019 trust in tax systems. The European Union must fight corporate tax dodging through legislative change and build a fair system that works for people and not just for giant corporations. At times of great inequality and suffering it is unacceptable that big business is not paying its fair share of taxes. The European Union can no longer avoid taking responsibility to put its house in order. \u201d Oxfam expects the European Commission to levy heavy fines on those guilty of breaking European Union rules on state aid. The charity stressed the importance of giving legal protection to those whistleblowers who take risks to reveal tax avoidance by big corporations. Bryer added: The European Union can also lead by example in making the transformative changes that are really needed. A clear definition and criteria for a tax haven list with the capacity to sanction and blacklist is necessary. And public country-by-country-reporting will allow scrutiny on where corporate profits are made and where they should be taxed, providing a unique opportunity for European countries to demonstrate their will to fight tax avoidance.\u2019\u2019 On financial markets, the FTSE 100 index in London has turned positive, trading 36 points higher at 6381, a 0.6% gain. This is despite a sharp fall in Pearson shares, which are now down 16.5% at 992.5p, following a profit warning from the educational publisher. Elsewhere in Europe, markets have also shrugged off poor corporate results. Germany\u2019s Dax and France\u2019s CAC are both 0.9% ahead. Vestager said: \u201cWe need a fundamental shift in corporate philosophies.\u201d She said paying their fair share of tax should be part of companies\u2019 social responsibility. Linklaters competition partner and state aid expert Natura Gracia said today\u2019s decisions are \u201cbasically about the Commission setting the limits for what member states can and cannot do in terms of reaching individual agreements with tax payers\u201d. She added: It\u2019s a bold move by Vestager showing that she will not shy away from taking decisive action even in a controversial policy area such as taxation. While the Commission recognises the legitimacy of tax rulings and the freedom for Member States to decide on their tax regimes, companies should be mindful of relying on those rulings going forward. Given the significant financial consequences of state aid enforcement, it will be prudent for companies to test the legality of individual rulings they have received or will be applying for.\u201d The Dutch government said it was \u201csurprised\u201d by the European Commission\u2019s decision on its tax deal with Starbucks, insisting that the arrangement was in line with international standards. It said in a statement: The fact that the Commission observes that there would be state aid in the Starbucks file raises a lot of questions. The Netherlands is convinced that actual international standards are applied.\u201d Margrethe Vestager, the EU\u2019s competition commissioner, said: We\u2019ve found a large variety of methods, one more complex than the other ... These arrangements shifted profits from one company to another in the same group without economic justification. But the result is that companies pay almost no tax on profits made.\u201d You can listen to the press conference live here. The Amazon and Apple tax deal cases are very different from Starbucks and Fiat, Margrethe Vestager, the EU\u2019s competition commissioner, has told a news conference. These are very different cases and will be assessed on their own merit. The outcome today does not prejudge the next decisions we will eventually take. We will take a decision when the cases are ready for decision making.\u201d In the UK, the Liberal Democrats celebrated the EC ruling as a \u201cgame-changer in the fight against corporate tax avoidance\u201d. Catherine Bearder MEP, chair of the Liberal Democrat EU referendum campaign, said: By working together across Europe, we can clamp down on tax-dodging and get a fairer deal for British taxpayers and businesses. Outside the EU, Britain would find it much harder to ensure multinationals pay their fair share.\u201d The Luxembourg government also disagreed with the European Commission\u2019s tax ruling. An official said: Luxembourg disagrees with the conclusions reached by the European Commission in the Fiat Finance and Trade case and reserves all its rights. Luxembourg will use appropriate due diligence to analyse the decision of the Commission as well as its legal rationale. Luxembourg already notes that the European Commission has used unprecedented criteria in establishing the alleged State aid. In particular, the Commission has not established in any way that Fiat Finance and Trade received selective advantages with reference to Luxembourg\u2019s national legal framework. Luxembourg does not consider that Fiat Finance and Trade has been granted incompatible State aid, as foreseen by article 107(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. Luxembourg adheres to international standards, in particular those relating to the arm\u2019s length principle applicable with respect to transfer pricing, and with State aid rules.\u201d Starbucks has been quick to respond to the EU tax ruling, saying it intends to appeal. A spokesperson said: Starbucks shares the concerns expressed by the Netherlands government that there are significant errors in the decision, and we plan to appeal since we followed the Dutch and OECD rules available to anyone. The dispute between the European Commission and the Netherlands as to which OECD rules we and others should follow could require us to pay about \u20ac20m to \u20ac30m on top of the $3bn in global taxes we have paid over the seven years in question (2008-2014). Starbucks complies with all OECD rules, guidelines and laws and supports its tax reform process. Starbucks has paid an average global effective tax rate of roughly 33%, well above the 18.5% average rate paid by other large US companies.\u201d In the case of Starbucks, which has a coffee roasting subsidiary in Amsterdam, the Commission concluded that a tax ruling issued by the Dutch authorities in 2008 gave it a selective advantage, and reduced its tax burden by \u20ac20-30m. In particular, the 2008 ruling artificially lowered taxes paid by Starbucks Manufacturing in two ways, the Commission explained: Starbucks Manufacturing pays a very substantial royalty to Alki (a UK-based company in the Starbucks group) for coffee-roasting know-how. It also pays an inflated price for green coffee beans to Switzerland-based Starbucks Coffee Trading SARL. The Commission said a tax ruling issued by the Luxembourg authorities in 2012 gave a selective advantage to Fiat\u2019s financial subsidiary in the Grand Duchy, Fiat Finance and Trade, which has unduly reduced its tax burden since 2012 by \u20ac20-30m. It said the 2012 tax ruling \u201cendorses an artificial and extremely complex methodology that is not appropriate for the calculation of taxable profits reflecting market conditions\u201d. In particular, it artificially lowers taxes paid by Fiat Finance and Trade in two ways, the Commission explained: Due to a number of economically unjustifiable assumptions and down-ward adjustments, the capital base approximated by the tax ruling is much lower thanthe company\u2019s actual capital. The estimated remuneration applied to this already much lower capital for tax purposes is also much lower compared to market rates. EU competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager said: Tax rulings that artificially reduce a company\u2019s tax burden are not in line with EU state aid rules. They are illegal. I hope that, with today\u2019s decisions, this message will be heard by member state governments and companies alike. All companies, big or small, multinational or not, should pay their fair share of tax.\u201d You can read the commission\u2019s full statement here. The EU Commission said the companies\u2019 tax deals with the Netherlands and Luxembourg gave them selective tax advantages. A statement just issued said: The Commission has ordered Luxembourg and the Netherlands to recover the unpaid tax from Fiat and Starbucks, respectively in order to remove the unfair competitive advantage they have enjoyed and to restore equal treatment with other companies in similar situations. The amounts to recover are \u20ac20-30m for each company.\u201d The European Commission has ruled that Starbucks and Fiat\u2019s sweetheart tax deals with the Dutch and Luxembourg authorities respectively are illegal, and ordered the governments to recover between \u20ac20 and \u20ac30m in back taxes from each multinational. Back to the EU tax ruling, which should be coming any minute now. Alan Clarke of Scotiabank said: The Office for Budget Responsibility\u2019s projection for the full year is for a \u00a320bn reduction compared with the previous financial year. So we are moving in the right direction, but not fast enough. There is still six months to make up for lost time, but I suspect that the \u00a369.5bn target for the year will not be met.\u201d Investec economist Chris Hare said: Today\u2019s (marginally positive) print marks a continued closing in the deficit, but still not at quite at the same pace as that embodied in the OBR\u2019s projections. We are now six months into the fiscal year and cumulative borrowing stands at \u00a346bn \u2013 that is \u00a31.2bn per month less, on average, than the first six months of the last fiscal year. At this rate, borrowing would be set to reach around \u00a375bn in the 15/16 fiscal year, versus \u00a390bn in 2014/15. However, this would imply a slight overshoot of the OBR\u2019s borrowing projection of \u00a369.5bn for 2015/16. This is no major cause for concern though \u2013 we have only reached half time in this fiscal year.\u201d On the economic front, Britain\u2019s public finances improved by more than expected in September, as record revenues for the month from income, VAT and corporation tax flowed into Treasury coffers. Public borrowing came in at \u00a39.4bn last month, down from \u00a311bn a year earlier, and below City forecasts of \u00a310.1bn. However, George Osborne is still struggling to meet his borrowing targets for the year, after a disappointing outturn in August. While tax receipts surged to a record level for the month of September, central government spending also climbed to its highest level since records began. Meanwhile, there is a new twist in the Volkswagen saga. A Norwegian shipowner, I.M. Skaugen, is seeking $50m in compensation from a marine unit of the German carmaker for rigging performance tests of ship engines produced over a decade ago, Reuters reports. I.M. Skaugen alleges that the specifications of the six engines it bought from MAN were misleading and it is seeking compensation for higher fuel use than specified over the expected 30-year lifetime of the engines. VW now owns 75% of MAN Diesel and Turbo, although it did not own the business when the engines were manufactured. The allegations are a further blow to Volkswagen, which faces massive penalties and class-action lawsuits around the world after admitting that some of its diesel cars were fitted with software that manipulated emissions tests. Some 11m vehicles are affected. Margrethe Vestager\u2019s tax crackdown on global corporations comes after last year\u2019s LuxLeaks. The leaked documents showed that the Grand Duchy \u2013 a tiny state with a population of half a million \u2013 struck tax deals with some 340 companies around the world to help them save millions in tax. In a useful primer ahead of the EC ruling, Politico writes: Wait a second, can Vestager actually set corporate tax rates? No, she can\u2019t. Tax rates is one of the areas where national capitals reign supreme. But some of them \u2014 especially Luxembourg City and Dublin \u2014 have been offering ultra-low tax rates to attract some of the world\u2019s biggest corporate names, and the money, jobs and prestige that come with them. Ultra-low tax rates are fine, says Vestager, provided they are available to all companies and not just the chosen few, who would enjoy an advantage over smaller, less-well-connected rivals. Why is Vestager first targeting Fiat and Starbucks, not Apple or Amazon? Since taking office, Vestager has charged Google with breaching EU competition law, and opened probes into Qualcomm and Amazon. So maybe she felt it was time to give U.S. tech firms at least a temporary break. Charging one European carmaker and one U.S. coffee shop chain avoids the accusations of only bashing Silicon Valley. She could, however, be testing the waters. Apple is the big one. The rulings are likely to be appealed, but are already having far-reaching implications, according to international law firm Pinsent Masons. Heather Self, partner at Pinsent Masons, said: Multinationals will be particularly anxious about the Starbucks case. The ruling process in the Netherlands is long-established and very well-respected internationally. For competition authorities to challenge very technical tax rulings by competent authorities in this way is extremely destabilising.\u201d It has implications not just for companies that have received tax rulings from the Netherlands in the past, but for any multinational operating anywhere in Europe. The fact that EU competition authorities feel it appropriate to intervene in highly complex international tax issues adds another layer of complexity and unpredictability.\u201d Caroline Ramsay, senior associate and state aid expert at Pinsent Masons, added: Having taken the cases this far, most experts are anticipating that the EU will rule that the tax rulings did constitute an award of unlawful state aid to the tax payer. If the findings are as is expected, then it is highly likely that they will be appealed to the European Court of Justice, and the taxpayers themselves may also appeal the decision.\u201d While this appeal process could take some years, in practical terms, we are already entering a new era. Multinationals are already ensuring that state aid is part of their considerations in setting up a new tax structure in Europe.\u201d So what is it all about? The European Commission is expected to rule that Starbucks and Fiat Chrysler had unlawful tax deals with the Netherlands and Luxembourg \u2013 by declaring that they constitute unlawful state aid. The American coffee company has made the Netherlands its European hub by basing a bean-roasting subsidiary in Amsterdam. Fiat has based an internal financing subsidiary in Luxembourg, to benefit from favourable tax treatments in those countries. Both companies are believed to have been paying a fraction of the headline tax rates in Luxembourg and the Netherlands for many years, my Guardian colleague Simon Bowers reports. Any additional tax would be paid to the authorities in the Netherlands and Luxembourg. Amazon and Apple are next, and could open the floodgates to more tax rulings, legal experts say. Returning to the European Commission\u2019s decision on tax avoidance, a press conference will be held at 12.30pm in Brussels (11.30am UK time), but the ruling could come earlier. Margrethe Vestager, the EU\u2019s competition commissioner, has been dubbed the Danish tax reaper. She even cancelled a trip to China, citing pressing work matters, to announce the ruling today which comes after a 15-month investigation. Starbucks could be billed about \u20ac30m (\u00a322m) in additional taxes, according to the Financial Times (\u00a3), which cited sources close to the investigation. Fiat\u2019s bill is expected to be even higher. So Ferrari will start trading on Wall Street, under the ticker RACE this afternoon. The shares have been priced at the top end of expectations, at $52. As car enthusiasts snapped them up alongside institutional investors, the IPO raised nearly $900m (\u00a3580m) on Tuesday, valuing the company at almost $10bn. Parent Fiat Chrysler is taking Ferrari public to sell a tenth of its 90% stake in the luxury brand. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, is a bit sceptical. While the appeal of owning a piece of such a marque or luxury brand has its obvious attractions, which explains why the IPO is oversubscribed, one can\u2019t help feeling what the advantages of owning the shares would be to a potential investor? Trading as it does at 33 times earnings the valuation seems rather high, given that car sales volumes are limited by exclusivity, unless there are certain privileges involved in being a shareholder like VIP access to the F1 paddock perhaps? When one thinks of luxury marque brands the names of Rolls Royce Cars, Bentley, Bugatti, Lamborghini, Maybach and Aston Martin all trip off the tongue and all of these are subsidiaries of major car companies, BMW, Volkswagen Audi, Daimler and Ford, where the brand doesn\u2019t have to necessarily stand on its own two feet. Even so one can\u2019t help feeling that Fiat are surely missing a trick in not having a dual listing in Europe, particularly given how fanatical the \u201ctifosi\u201d are about the \u201cPrancing Horse\u201d brand. One company that might be more than an interested party in the success of this particular IPO is Volkswagen. If their problems get any worse they could find themselves having to do something similar to Fiat and look at potentially offloading Bentley, Bugatti or Lamborghini, particularly if the Ferrari float goes well.\u201d Home Retail shares have crashed 13% to 130p after the profit warning. Profits at its Argos chain almost halved in the first six months of the year. The company blamed falling sales of TVs, tablet computers and other electrical computers, and of summer goods. Educational publisher Pearson, which sold the Financial Times newspaper to Nikkei in July, has also warned that 2015 profits would be at the lower end of the expected range. Shares in the FTSE 100 company slumped more than 12% to \u00a310.42. Merlin Entertainments has teamed up with China Media Capital to open a Legoland near Shanghai. Merlin runs UK attractions including Madame Tussauds, Sea Life Centres and the London Eye. The UK company already runs five attractions in China, including Madame Tussauds and Chang Feng Ocean World aquarium, and wants to open three others in the next 18 months. The news comes as Lego warned that it may run out of bricks for Christmas. The Danish company has overtaken Barbie doll maker Mattel to become the world\u2019s largest toymaker by sales. Even though its factories are running at full throttle, it is struggling to keep up with demand from European toy stores. Good morning and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and the business world. We are expecting an EU ruling on tax avoidance this morning. Starbucks and Fiat Chrysler are likely to have to pay tens of millions of euros in additional taxes, with the European Commission expected to rule that they had unlawful deals with the Netherlands and Luxembourg. Rulings on Amazon and Apple will follow. My Guardian colleague Simon Bowers writes: Starbucks has for years made the Netherlands its European hub while Fiat has based a lucrative internal financing subsidiary in Luxembourg. In both cases, the multinationals approached the local tax authorities to seek assurances that their controversial tax structures in these countries would not be challenged. These assurances \u2013 often known as \u201ccomfort letters\u201d \u2013 are expected to be torn up on Wednesday when Margrethe Vestager, the competition commissioner, confirms the commission has concluded that the two tax rulings constitute illegal state aid. The decision into the sweetheart tax deals follows a 15-month investigation.\u201d You can read the full preview here. Also today: Home Retail Group, which owns the Argos and Homebase chains, has just issued a profit warning. UK public finance figures for September are out at 9.30am The Ferrari IPO in New York is due to kick off at $52 a share, valuing the company at $10bn. Fiat-Chrysler wants to spin off the brand to set it apart from its more mass market brands. And Bank of England governor Mark Carney will give a speech on Brexit this evening.",

Companies like Starbucks and Fiat will continue to play the system unless the European Commission and Member States work together to close tax loopholes and punish those who break the rules.</p> <p>It\u2019s not just rich countries that lose out to tax dodging, it costs people in poor countries billions every year that could help to pay for desperately needed schools and hospitals.</p> <p>The work undertaken so far is a first step, but only with a full investigation can the European Commission start to restore European citizens\u2019 trust in tax systems. The European Union must fight corporate tax dodging through legislative change and build a fair system that works for people and not just for giant corporations. At times of great inequality and suffering it is unacceptable that big business is not paying its fair share of taxes. The European Union can no longer avoid taking responsibility to put its house in order. \u201d </p> </blockquote> <p>Oxfam expects the European Commission to levy heavy fines on those guilty of breaking European Union rules on state aid. The charity stressed the importance of giving legal protection to those whistleblowers who take risks to reveal tax avoidance by big corporations.</p> <p>Bryer added: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The European Union can also lead by example in making the transformative changes that are really needed. A clear definition and criteria for a tax haven list with the capacity to sanction and blacklist is necessary. And public country-by-country-reporting will allow scrutiny on where corporate profits are made and where they should be taxed, providing a unique opportunity for European countries to demonstrate their will to fight tax avoidance.\u2019\u2019</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"94a87f0e6238287314e254057aa9dbc5581f9280\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/94a87f0e6238287314e254057aa9dbc5581f9280/0_201_5000_2998/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Oxfam shop in Dalston, London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Oxfam shop in Dalston, London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Linda Nylind for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56276d62e4b0b5437fa97710\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-10-21T10:51:19.845Z\">11.51am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">European markets shrug off poor results</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>On financial markets, the FTSE 100 index in London has turned positive, trading 36 points higher at 6381, a 0.6% gain.

      "bodyText": "Affluent men in England and Wales are outliving the average woman for the first time since official records began, thanks to the sharp reduction in smoking and the decline in manual work. The Office for National Statistics said on Wednesday that \u201chigher managerial and professional men\u201d can expect to live for 82.5 years, one month longer than the 82.4 years of life expectancy for the average woman. The gap between the sexes has narrowed dramatically in the past 30 years, with men gaining an additional seven years in life expectancy since 1986, compared with the four and a half year improvement for women over the same period. But the latest ONS figures, for 2007-11, mask deep inequalities between social classes and geographical areas of the country. The ONS research found that while male solicitors, actuaries, clergy and surveyors have an average life expectancy of 82.5 years, men working as streetsweepers, fishmongers, welders and window fitters will survive to only 76.6 years. The interactive data allows users to input their job and gender to see their average life expectancy \u2013 with some surprising results. Male fitness instructors have a lower life expectancy (77.9) than the average male journalist (80.8 years). Meanwhile, female florists (80.8) live shorter lives than female care workers (81.9) and several years less than a female estate agent (84.5 years). The ONS said: \u201cHistorically women have outlived men and back in the early 1980s even those women in the least advantaged socioeconomic group could expect to live longer (at 77.2 years) than the most advantaged group of men (75.7 years). \u201cSince the 1970s, men have been catching women up in terms of survival. The decline of the mining industry and the move away from physical labour and manufacturing industries towards the service sector is a likely cause, along with a reduction in the proportion of men smoking.\u201d Men have been slightly more successful than women in giving up smoking, the leading cause of preventable deaths. In 1974, 51% of men smoked cigarettes compared with 41% of women, whereas 22% of men smoked cigarettes in 2013 compared with 17% of women. But over the same period, inequalities in life expectancy by income have widened for both men and women, with the biggest gains enjoyed by those earning the most, said the ONS. In 1997-2001, the poorest women lived on average 3.8 years less than the richest women. But since then, the figure has widened to 5.3 years, the biggest gap that statisticians have recorded. Health professionals warn that the epidemic of obesity and diabetes could throw into reverse improvements in lifespans. Public Health England said moderate obesity cuts life expectancy by three years, while the morbidly obese can expect to die eight to 10 years earlier than the average person.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Credit Suisse is to cut about 2,000 jobs at its London operation, either by laying off staff or moving posts offshore. The cuts, part of a $6.3bn (\u00a34.1bn) restructuring plan introduced by the new chief executive, Tidjane Thiam, which involves slimming down the group\u2019s investment bank, include axing about a third of the posts at Credit Suisse\u2019s London office. The move could result in back-office jobs being moved to Poland or India, the group\u2019s employees heard on Wednesday. \u201cThere\u2019s absolutely no point in so many people in back-office jobs being located in Canary Wharf, where rents are some of the highest in the world,\u201d said a source. Some of the job losses will come through attrition, with no new jobs advertised in certain positions in London and leavers not being replaced. Estimates suggest there are currently 6,600 people working for the Swiss-owned bank in London. The cuts are part of a plan to reduce the bank\u2019s cost-base worldwide. There will be 1,600 job cuts in Switzerland and 2,000 in the US, where Credit Suisse\u2019s private bank will be transferred to Wells Fargo. The bank wants to shave about 10% off its cost base. Thiam has been working on the strategy review since he joined from Prudential in July. He wants to focus more on private banking and wealth management while, in common with other European groups grappling with the stricter regulatory regime that followed the financial crisis, reducing the scope of the investment bank. Thiam said the bank was \u201ctaking decisive action to strengthen our balance sheet and capital position to the point where it will not be any more a source of concern for our clients, our investors or our regulators\u201d. The bank announced its new strategy alongside disappointing third-quarter results. Net profits shrank 24% to 779m Swiss francs (\u00a3527) from a year earlier, and revenues slipped 8% to 5.98bn Swiss francs, the bank said. Pre-tax earnings at Credit Suisse\u2019s private banking and wealth management unit plunged 31% to 647m Swiss francs. The downsizing comes ahead of likely retrenchment in London for Deutsche Bank, which is making a strategy announcement on 29 October. The cuts come at a time when big banks are thinking carefully about their presence in London in the run-up to the vote on whether the UK should remain part of the EU. Banks are working on scenarios in which many of their operations are moved away from London in the event of a vote to exit. Jobs in London\u2019s financial and related professional services industry reached an all-time high of 729,600 in June 2015, the latest survey by lobby group TheCityUK said this month. But tough regulation imposed since the financial crisis, high real estate costs, and uncertainty about Britain\u2019s membership of the EU have prompted a number of big banks, including HSBC, to look at the economic viability of remaining in the City. Credit Suisse said it aimed to raise a total of $6.3bn by selling stock to selected shareholders and existing investors. Shareholders will be asked to vote on the move on 19 November. \u201cOne of our objectives coming in was to take capital off the table, to raise enough capital so that this would not be again a topic of conversation at quarterly results,\u201d said Thiam, who was brought in to restore investor confidence in the struggling bank.",

      "bodyText": "A sweetheart tax deal struck in private between Starbucks and Dutch tax officials five years ago has been ruled to be unlawful state aid aid by the European commission. A second deal between Fiat Chrysler and Luxembourg\u2019s tax authorities also violated European state aid rules, the commission confirmed. The two companies are expected to face tens of millions of euros in additional tax bills. The move is part of a Brussels crackdown on private tax deals some member states strike with large multinationals. Commission officials are looking at similar deals secured by Amazon in Luxembourg and Apple in Ireland. Margrethe Vestager, the competition commissioner, said: \u201cTax rulings that artificially reduce a company\u2019s tax burden are not in line with EU state aid rules. They are illegal. I hope that, with today\u2019s decisions, this message will be heard by member state governments and companies alike. All companies \u2013 big or small, multinational or not \u2013 should pay their fair share of tax.\u201d Starbucks said it planned to appeal against the commission\u2019s decision, claiming it contained significant errors. While the decision was technically against the Dutch state for endorsing Starbucks\u2019 controversial structure, the coffee firm said those accused of receiving illegal state aid were entitled to appeal against such a decision in the European courts. The commission estimates that since 2008 the Dutch tax ruling allowed Starbucks to avoid tax of between \u20ac20m and \u20ac30m (\u00a314m-\u00a322m). The same sum was estimated to have been avoided at Fiat in the last three years. Last year, Starbucks\u2019 Dutch unit paid less than \u20ac600,000 in tax while Fiat\u2019s Luxembourg subsidiary paid less than \u20ac400,000. There were strong hints of appeals from Luxembourg and the Netherlands, too. The grand duchy\u2019s government said: \u201cLuxembourg notes that the commission has used unprecedented criteria in establishing the alleged state aid. In particular, the commission has not established in any way that Fiat \u2026 received selective advantages with reference to Luxembourg\u2019s legal framework.\u201d The Dutch government said it was \u201csomewhat surprised\u201d by the decision and would study it before deciding whether to lodge an appeal. \u201cWithin the Dutch tax system profit is taxed where value is created.\u201d Starbucks has for years made Amsterdam the heart of its European operations, while Fiat set up group financing activities in Luxembourg. Income from many other countries was shifted into the Netherlands and Luxembourg via interest, royalties and other intra-group payments. Starbucks and Fiat had separately set up complex tax avoidance structures there that meant their income was subject to very low rates of tax. The commission found the avoidance structures should not have been sanctioned by Luxembourg and the Netherlands in tax rulings, sometimes known as \u201ccomfort letters\u201d. They said the member states had endorsed \u201cartificial and complex\u201d structures, devised by Fiat and Starbucks tax planners, that did \u201cnot reflect economic reality\u201d. Brussels competition officials have no powers to challenge generous tax deals offered to multinationals directly. They are only able to intervene if it can be shown that a specific deal was offered to one or more companies and not made available to competitors. Vestager said the decisions in relation to Starbucks and Fiat sent \u201ca clear message: national tax authorities cannot give any company, however large or powerful, an unfair competitive advantage compared to others\u201d. As well as ongoing investigations into Apple\u2019s affairs in Ireland and Amazon\u2019s deal with Luxembourg, she said: \u201cMore cases may come, if we have indications that EU state aid rules are not being complied with.\u201d However, she added that state aid investigations were \u201cjust one part of a wider package that needs to come together to effectively address corporate tax avoidance\u201d. Greater tax coordination between member states was necessary to eliminate loopholes and the mismatches between national tax systems that were being routinely exploited by multinationals, she said. Proposals for such coordination were set out by the European commissioner for tax, Pierre Moscovici, in June, but are deeply unpopular with several governments. Countries such as the UK and Ireland have seen their economies strengthen as they have offered increasingly more generous tax breaks to global companies prepared to invest locally and create jobs. As a result they have made clear they will not be part of commission plans for greater tax coordination.",

      "bodyText": "Home Retail Group shares dived more than 16% on Wednesday, wiping \u00a3200m off the value of the owner of Argos and Homebase, after it issued a pre-Christmas profit warning. The retailer said annual profits were likely to be poorer than expected as it had ploughed millions of pounds into a multimedia advertising campaign and taken on hundreds more vans to back a new delivery service before Black Friday, which falls on 27 November this year, but could not be sure how shoppers would respond. Home Retail\u2019s chief executive, John Walden, said the recent rise of the late November sales bonanza, which only arrived in the UK in earnest last year, made it particularly difficult to predict how this year would play out. \u201cWe are certainly competing hard and have plans based on how we think Black Friday will unfold but it is very hard to estimate. Retailers who believe the pattern is certain are guessing,\u201d Walden said. Home Retail\u2019s concerns are shared by John Lewis, which has warned that Black Friday needs to be \u201creined in\u201d because it pulls forward festive purchases and damages Christmas trading. Despite the uncertainty, Walden said Argos had taken on 700 more vans than last year and more than 3,000 additional drivers in order to back a new quick delivery service because \u201cfor the long term health of the business that was the right thing to do\u201d. Home Retail said it expected annual profit before tax to be slightly below the bottom end of market expectations which were between \u00a3115m and \u00a3140m. Walden added that poorer than expected trading at Argos in the first half of the year had also contributed to the profit warning. Sales at stores open a year or more slid 3.4% in the six months to 29 August as the markets for tablet computers, TVs and cameras all shrank by at least 15%. First-half profits at Argos halved to \u00a36.4m as sales of seasonal summer goods \u2013 including lawn mowers and garden tools \u2013 also fell. Operating and distribution costs, meanwhile, rose \u00a314m as the chain opened new stores and added extra vehicles. Argos\u2019s sales have suffered this year despite heavy investment to fight the likes of Amazon by offering same-day delivery and modernising stores \u2013 swapping stubby pens and laminated catalogues for touchscreen computers in a bid to attract more upmarket customers. One analyst said Argos risked being \u201cthe next Comet/MFI/Woolworths\u201d \u2013 all businesses that went bust and disappeared from the high street. \u201cWe believe at the very least that HRG/Argos has to demonstrate a more pro-active strategy in terms of defending itself,\u201d said Tony Shiret at Haitong Securities. Sales at Argos fell 1.5% to \u00a31.74bn and sales at stores open a year or more dropped by 3.4%. Walden said the comparison with Comet was \u201cridiculous\u201d. He insisted that Argos\u2019 updated \u201cdigital\u201d stores were performing better than traditional outlets and so more would be converted. Homebase, which has closed 25 stores as sales move increasingly online, had a stronger first half, with its profit up from \u00a327.8m to \u00a334.3m. That helped underpin an increase in total group profits from \u00a330.9m to \u00a334.1m for the half year. Despite increased consumer confidence, the retail sector is grappling with fierce competition, the rise of online shopping and uncertainty among some customers as the government brings in more austerity measures, including cuts to tax credits. Asked about the implications of having to pay the \u201cnational living wage\u201d to the group\u2019s employees, Walden said the move would increase costs by about \u00a315m a year, adding: \u201cOn the other hand, we are happy for our colleagues to make more money.\u201d He said he had not yet finalised the group\u2019s mitigation plans. Walden said the effect of the government\u2019s plan to withdraw in-work tax credits from 3 million of the poorest working families was not yet clear but added, in an apparent criticism of the policy: \u201cI am in favour of our consumers having more spending power.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Seismic changes in British shopping habits mean that half of us now buy our food as we do when on holiday \u2013 little and often, stocking up daily with fresh food for that evening\u2019s meal, according to a study. In its annual barometer of consumer shopping and spending, the food retailer Waitrose found that three in 10 people now visit a supermarket three to four times a week, up from a quarter five years ago. But the \u201copen all hours\u201d culture on the UK high street and freedom to shop in different ways also means that consumers admit to being daunted by choice, whether for informal dining, music streaming or TV on demand. They are opting to regain control by reimposing boundaries such as keeping certain nights free to eat together, or banning mobile phones from the dining table. Launching the chain\u2019s Food and Drink Report 2015 on Wednesday, Waitrose\u2019s managing director, Mark Price, said the shift in behaviour was characterised by time-poor consumers buying food on the go and for the evening ahead. In London, 40% of Waitrose sales are after 5pm, for example, as people grab dinner on the way home from work. Top-ups used to be unplanned; now they\u2019re deliberate Price, who is stepping down from the chain next April and is tipped to become Channel 4 chairman, said: \u201cAs society changes, so does the nature of shopping. It is more informal and flexible than ever before. High streets are seeing significant changes: today you can get a panini in a newsagent, a newspaper in a coffee shop, have a sit-down meal in a supermarket and buy your dinner in a petrol station. It can be overwhelming.\u201d Jon Arnold, Waitrose head of operations and trading, convenience, added: \u201cIt used to be that \u2018topping up\u2019 in a convenience store was unplanned and not particularly desired. But now shoppers deliberately work it into their weekly routine. They buy bulky food online, or all in one go, and then nip out in the week to buy dinner for that night.\u201d The report\u2019s findings are based on millions of transactions and feedback from Waitrose customers, as well as separate sessions with focus groups and further polling on a range of food-related topics. Waitrose this year revealed plans to create 2,000 jobs as it embarks on a store-opening spree following strong Christmas trading. The retailer, owned by the John Lewis Partnership, is opening a further 14 shops this year, split between supermarkets and Little Waitrose convenience shops. In the report, a third of consumers say that \u201cpausable\u201d TVs and services such as Netflix and iPlayer mean fewer TV dinners in our homes. Yet mealtimes are more informal than ever: one in seven families use their dining room less than they used to, while a quarter of us regularly eat \u201cal fresco\u201d. Microwave rules the kitchen roost In its spotlight on specific food and drink trends, the report reveals the impact of gadgets on specialist ingredients. Waitrose now sells more pre-chopped frozen fruit than frozen pizza thanks to the rise of juicing, while the spiraliser craze, which turns courgettes into ribbons, or courgetti, has boosted sales of the vegetable by 10% over the past year. Nevertheless, the microwave still rules the kitchen roost, with half of all consumers surveyed saying they use it more than any other gadget. This year\u2019s mild winter and early spring have produced bumper UK crops, including the earliest-ever start to the British strawberry season in March. British-produced rapeseed oil \u2013 including brands such as Hillfarm in east Suffolk as well as Waitrose\u2019s own brand \u2013 has elbowed aside pricier olive oil as the fastest-selling oil in the UK. Social media are also becoming increasingly influential for food choices. Avocado is the most pinned food on Pinterest in the UK, while roasted tomato and avocado toast is the fourth most watched recipe on the Waitrose TV channel on YouTube. For the older generation, food has become \u201cexciting where it was once functional\u201d. Waitrose reports that newly retired men are signing up in large numbers to its cookery school courses. Claire Lanze, head chef of the Waitrose cookery school in Salisbury, Wiltshire, said: \u201cThey\u2019re one of our fastest growing student groups, so we\u2019ve started trialling courses aimed specifically at them.\u201d",

They are opting to regain control by reimposing boundaries such as keeping certain nights free to eat together, or banning mobile phones from the dining table.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> <blockquote> <p>You can have a sit-down meal in a supermarket and buy your dinner in a petrol station. It can be overwhelming</p> <footer> <cite>Mark Price</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Launching the chain\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.waitrose.com/foodreport\">Food and Drink Report 2015</a> on Wednesday, Waitrose\u2019s managing director, Mark Price, said the shift in behaviour was characterised by time-poor consumers buying food on the go and for the evening ahead. In London, 40% of Waitrose sales are after 5pm, for example, as people grab dinner on the way home from work. <strong> </strong><br></p> <h2>Top-ups used to be unplanned; now they\u2019re deliberate</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/20/waitrose-boss-mark-price-quits\">Price</a>, who is stepping down from the chain next April <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/20/waitrose-boss-mark-price-quits\">and is tipped to become Channel 4 chairman</a>, said: \u201cAs society changes, so does the nature of shopping. It is more informal and flexible than ever before. High streets are seeing significant changes: today you can get a panini in a newsagent, a newspaper in a coffee shop, have a sit-down meal in a supermarket and buy your dinner in a petrol station. It can be overwhelming.\u201d</p> <p>Jon Arnold, Waitrose head of operations and trading, convenience, added: \u201cIt used to be that \u2018topping up\u2019 in a convenience store was unplanned and not particularly desired. But now shoppers deliberately work it into their weekly routine. They buy bulky food online, or all in one go, and then nip out in the week to buy dinner for that night.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fec9e3c3ef1f82b75b9afa6e9784089b054ee0eb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fec9e3c3ef1f82b75b9afa6e9784089b054ee0eb/0_118_2511_1507/1000.jpg\" alt=\"old oxo advert\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The first Oxo TV advert, screened in 1983.

Yet mealtimes are more informal than ever: one in seven families use their dining room less than they used to, while a quarter of us regularly eat \u201cal fresco\u201d. <br></p> <h2>Microwave rules the kitchen roost</h2> <p>In its spotlight on specific food and drink trends, the report reveals the impact of gadgets on specialist ingredients. Waitrose now sells more pre-chopped frozen fruit than frozen pizza thanks to the rise of juicing, while the spiraliser craze, which turns courgettes into ribbons, or courgetti, has boosted sales of the vegetable by 10% over the past year. Nevertheless, the microwave still rules the kitchen roost, with half of all consumers surveyed saying they use it more than any other gadget.</p> <p>This year\u2019s mild winter and early spring have produced bumper UK crops, including the earliest-ever start to the British strawberry season in March.

Waitrose reports that newly retired men are signing up in large numbers to its <a href=\"http://www.waitrose.com/home/inspiration/waitrose_cookeryschool.html\">cookery school</a> courses. Claire Lanze, head chef of the Waitrose cookery school in Salisbury, Wiltshire, said: \u201cThey\u2019re one of our fastest growing student groups, so we\u2019ve started trialling courses aimed specifically at them.\u201d<br></p> <p><br></p>",
