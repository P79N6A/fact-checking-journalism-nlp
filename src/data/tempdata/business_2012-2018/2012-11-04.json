      "bodyText": "The Bank of England will resist calls this week to pump extra funds into the economy despite concerns that a recent decline in manufacturing production and the weak construction sector could force the UK into a triple dip-recession. Policymakers at the central bank will debate how to generate growth after more than three years of falling living standards. With inflation consistently outstripping wages and a raft of cuts to benefits due in 2013, household incomes are likely to worsen, according to economists. The bank's monetary policy committee (MPC) is likely to keep its powder dry after the economy briefly sprang back to life in the third quarter when gross domestic product (GDP) grew 1%. A fall in unemployment in autumn and a modest rise in consumer spending have also offset worse-than-forecast manufacturing output, which has shrunk as the government's austerity policies and the euro crisis hit demand for UK goods. While some MPC members could vote to boost quantitative easing (QE) by \u00a350bn to \u00a3425bn, most economists expect a committee majority to keep interest rates at a record low of 0.5% and QE at \u00a3375bn. Both the BoE Governor and deputy governor, Sir Mervyn King and Paul Tucker, have suggested in recent speeches that the impact of QE is reaching its limit. Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight, said: \"While it still looks to be a close call, we believe the 1% quarter-on-quarter spike in GDP in the third quarter makes it more likely than not that the Bank of England will hold off from more QE.\" Members of the MPC have come under intense pressure to cut the cost of lending and boost credit in the economy as the Treasury maintains its determination to limit government to pay down debts. The MPC has waited to complete its last \u00a350bn of government bond purchases and a new direct-funding scheme for banks (funding for lending), before pushing ahead with another \u00a350bn of QE. Economic analysts, the CEBR, said the economy will remain weak in 2013 and 2014, though it will outstrip the eurozone as it copes with the double whammy of sharply declining incomes and rising debts in several key countries. The CEBR said the UK would grow by 0.8% next year and 1.4% in 2014 against a eurozone average of -0.4% in 2013 and 0.4% in 2014. \"Even assuming the problems of the euro do not cause an economic meltdown before the German elections next year, we are looking at a very weak economic outlook in Europe for the next two years\" said Tim Ohlenburg, senior economist at CEBR and main author of the report. However, the UK could fall back into an unprecedented third recession in four years if the 1% rise in the third quarter proves to be an Olympics-induced blip. The latest ICAEW/Grant Thornton UK business confidence monitor found smaller UK firms had scaled back plans for expansion in 2013. The report noted that a mood of caution suggests while some sectors and regions start to improve, \"economic recovery will be restrained in the next 12 months\". Michael Izza, chief executive of the accountancy body, the ICAEW, said: \"While the UK economy has come out of recession, business confidence is still very fragile. Against a backdrop of a softening global economy, the recovery is yet to take hold. More needs to be done to secure the UK's long-term economic outlook by encouraging businesses to invest and to stimulate growth.\" A survey of small businesses found that almost half were reluctant to invest in new jobs while confidence in the economy's ability to recover remained weak.

Greece is due to vote on \u20ac13.5bn of spending cuts and tax rises on Wednesday ahead of a budget vote next Sunday. Prime minister Antonis Samaras is confident he can win the vote to secure more than \u20ac37bn (\u00a330bn) of loans from the EU and International Monetary Fund.",

The development will prove hugely embarrassing for the chief executive, Stuart Gulliver, who has tried to distance HSBC from scandal-hit rivals since taking the top post last year. The bank, the UK's most valuable, is known for its financial strength.

      "bodyText": "Jiang Xingsan's day job is helping to run a vast agricultural group, the All-China Federation of Supply and Manufacturing Co-operatives, which serves millions of farmers across China, and has increased its payroll by 200,000 in the past year alone. But he was in Manchester last week, paying tribute to the Rochdale Pioneers. \"I'm especially proud to come to Manchester, because this city was the birthplace for co-operatives,\" he says. When the so-called Rochdale Equitable Pioneers Society set up shop in 1844, promising good quality food at fair prices, and a share of the profits for their customers, they couldn't have known that their big idea would spread around the world. More than 7,000 people, from 90 countries, gathered at the vast Manchester Central venue for \"Co-operatives 2012\" \u2013 part trade-show, part conference, part jamboree and the culmination of a UN-backed \"Year of Co-operatives\". Namibian weavers, Canadian bankers and Malaysian tour guides gathered with just one thing in common \u2013 their business model. Instead of being owned by shareholders, who extract a slice of the profits, all these co-operatives hand over any gains they make to their customers and staff. Before the credit crunch, co-ops were easily dismissed as worthy but irrelevant.

Our arguments have begun to find traction with global decision-makers on the back of the sustainability and resilience of our financial model over the past five years.\" Mayo has been appointed by David Cameron as a mutuals ambassador, to spread the word: and he says the argument is a much broader one than whether co-operatives are more ethical than their rapacious corporate rivals. \"There's a big story here: not just about responding to the credit crunch, but how the UK economy could be more productive and inclusive if it moves significantly towards a co-operative model,\" he says. Much of the movement's energy in the past year has been directed at persuading the government to commit to bringing together all the legislation affecting co-operatives in one so-called Consolidation Act, as previous governments did for charities and company law. Cameron has promised a Co-operatives Act by 2015, and the Law Commission has been given the job of doing the technical groundwork. \"Our vision is it should be as easy and natural to set up a co-operative as it is to set up a shareholder-owned business,\" says Mayo.

      "bodyText": "Michael Heseltine, the cabinet minister whose leadership bid precipitated the fall of Margaret Thatcher but not his own rise, has always been a breath of fresh air in British public life. When the Thatcher cabinet was divided, in her own terms, between \"wets\" and \"dries\" \u2013 the wets being ministers such as Sir Ian Gilmour, Jim Prior and Peter Walker, who opposed the monetarist policies adopted by Thatcher's \"dry\" entourage \u2013 Michael, now Lord, Heseltine, delighted in the ambivalent position of being regarded as \"half wet and half dry\". During a long period when it was unfashionable to say so, he made no secret of his belief in the important role of government, whether central or local, in promoting economic growth. With help from some ideas provided by the cabinet office thinktank, Heseltine played a major role in reviving Liverpool after the Toxteth riots. In recent years Heseltine has been an enthusiastic admirer of David Cameron's. It was a relief to some of us when the prime minister and chancellor called upon our wet and dry friend to come in from the cold, and he has not disappointed. What is more, the welcome accorded by Cameron and Osborne to a report that challenges their approach to many things has been warm enough to escape the accusation of \"damning with faint praise\". It is easy to lose count of the recommendations, on everything from transport infrastructure to local government, that Heseltine has made, but 89 seems to be the agreed figure for the total in his report No Stone Unturned: In Pursuit of Growth. If we stand back from the detail, over which there will be endless arguments and infighting, it is the broad approach that matters. This country, in postwar decades, has lurched from one policy fashion to another in pursuit of the economic philosopher's stone. This stone, with due respect to Heseltine, has remained persistently unturned. In the 1960s and 1970s we had national plans and forums such as The National Economic Development Council that brought what were known as \"both sides of industry\" (employers and trade unionists) together with government. These were all collective efforts to resolve the British economy's weaknesses, accompanied by attempts by governments of both major political parties \"to back winners\". After the short life of the Industrial Reorganisation Corporation in the late 1960s, the fashion turned against intervention, the classic failure being the government-engineered merger of Leyland Motors with BMC to create British Leyland. But as Nicholas Comfort notes in his book Surrender, \"the IRC itself performed valuable work in bringing together companies in fields like engineering, between which there was a natural synergy\". Under Thatcher and her svengali Sir Keith Joseph \u2013 who thought the Department of Trade and Industry, which he headed, should be abolished \u2013 government intervention became dirty words, and the future lay in deregulation and low taxes. Well, we all know where that led. The wider significance of Heseltine's report is that the coalition is finally waking up to the fact that extreme free-market policies are bad for the nation's health, and \"may contain nuts\". It is foolhardy for governments not to take a strategic view of the supply side of the economy: why, the CBI has been crying out for this floppy coalition to make up its mind about energy and infrastructure \u2013 policies that affect the plans of business big and small. Heseltine is well aware of how the policies of recent years have aggravated the imbalance between manufacturing and financial services, as well as between London and the regions. It was significant that he launched his report in Birmingham, the base of one of his heroes, Joseph Chamberlain. I wish the noble lord nothing but the best in embarking on the long haul of British industrial and regional revival. But at this stage one has to sound a dissenting note. Economics is about supply and demand. Contrary to the belief of the early 19th century French philosopher Jean-Baptiste Say, (promulgator of Say's Law), supply does not create its own demand. Heseltine says he endorses the government's deficit reduction strategy. I wonder if he really does. There is a huge shortage of demand in this economy and in most of the rest of Europe. The Keynesian revolution was about the need to manage demand. As Martin Beck of Capital Economics points out, GDP in the UK is now about 14% below what it would have been if the long-run trend rate of growth had continued after the financial crisis. Beck reckons that, even assuming the crisis has permanently damaged some capacity, the economy is still operating at about 6% below potential because of premature \"fiscal consolidation\". Alas, the damage to our industrial structure is such that the recent devaluation of the pound has still left us with a formidable trade deficit. The Office for Budget Responsibility and the National Institute of Economic and Social Research are both concerned about the trend of the current balance of overseas payments. In a disconcertingly convincing pamphlet, A Price That Matters (Civitas) the economist John Mills argues that the pound remains seriously overvalued. The terrible truth may be that, in order for exporters and rivals to importers to take advantage of all that spare capacity, and boost output and employment, we need yet another significant devaluation. William Keegan's new book, Saving the World? Gordon Brown Reconsidered, is published by Searching Finance at \u00a39.99",

    "webTitle": "Nervous Cadbury settles in with a new owner as Kraft splits itself in two", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "L\u00f6rrach, on the edge of the Black Forest, may be 700 miles away from Cadbury's historic home of Bournville, but it too can lay claim to a chocolate-making tradition dating back more than 100 years. The picture-postcard town is home to Milka, Germany's favourite chocolate bar; the factory gates are close enough to the Alps to receive milk from the herds grazing in the mountain meadows. Here too, a purple corporate livery is much in evidence \u2013 although Milka's art-nouveau lilac is of a distinctly lighter shade than Cadbury's now trademarked Pantone 2685C. And both are now outposts of the sprawling Kraft global empire. Plant manager Peter Jungbeck says: \"L\u00f6rrach is like Bournville. They have been making chocolate for 170 years and we have been doing it for 130. The people are very proud that a brand like Milka is in their city.\" With 3m bars rolling off its production lines each day, Milka is the biggest local employer. Like Cadbury, it was once part of a family-run business, started by Swiss chocolatier Philippe Suchard, but it became part of Kraft following the 1990 takeover of Jacobs Suchard and is now one of its biggest brands, with annual sales of more than $1bn and spinoffs such as biscuits, cheese spread and hot chocolate. The Suchard name, in its classic gold embossed lettering, disappeared from the packets long ago. Cadbury was swallowed up by Kraft in 2010 after one of the hardest-fought takeovers in recent memory \u2013 but with the ink barely dry on the new stationery, it was all change again last month as the US group went ahead with a surprise demerger that saw more than 100 of its snack brands, including Cadbury, Milka, Toblerone and Oreo, spun off under the newly created banner of Mondelez International. The shakeup, unions fear, could spell change for 6,500 staff in the UK and Ireland, not least because factory workers are no longer protected by a pledge of no compulsory redundancies. The promise, which expired in March, was extracted from Kraft after it was called to account by parliament for reneging on the closure of the Cadbury plant at Somerdale near Bristol. Jennie Formby, national officer for food and drink industries at the union Unite, is concerned after 200 positions were cut at the end of last year: \"We never thought sites would close straight away, but there are certainly vulnerabilities \u2013 not just in the UK and Ireland but in the whole of Europe.\" At the Light Cube, a glass office block in Zurich, Mondelez's European head, Tim Cofer, met the press for the first time last week and waxed enthusiastic about the outlook for the month-old company \u2013 which, despite the split, is still the world's biggest chocolate and biscuit manufacturer with annual sales of $36bn. What was previously Kraft's European base is emblazoned with the company's garish new logo \u2013 also purple \u2013 and Cofer, a high-flier with the ear of group chief executive Irene Rosenfeld, insists the logic for the split was \"compelling\", creating two companies with different specialities and geographical footprints. But with 59 factories in Europe, the business is a jigsaw of assets amassed on an acquisition trail that has included Jacobs Suchard, Danone's biscuit arm Lef\u00e8vre-Utile (LU) \u2013 maker of classic French biscuits such as Petit Beurre \u2013 and most recently Cadbury. Cofer admits: \"There will be change over the coming years as we look for the most efficient network in the industry to support this snacking company. Our portfolio is too complicated, we have too many product lines and can unlock benefits from simplifying our portfolio.\" With nearly half its sales rung up in emerging markets, Cofer says Mondelez offers investors \"exposure to a higher growth profile\", and with eyes firmly on the demerger, he is eager to drive the corporate message home: \"This is not the old Kraft Foods \u2013 this is Mondelez International and we are a global company.\" The European business is also a big piece of the Mondelez pie, accounting for nearly 40% of sales, whereas North America, where it retains its listing, contributes less than a fifth of turnover. The opposite is true of the other half of the demerger, which will retain its original name. Kraft, famously described by one Cadbury descendant as that \"plastic cheese company\", will now account for turnover of around $19bn, having been left with a larder full of US grocery brands such as Miracle Whip, Jell-O and Kool-Aid. From Kraft's standpoint the \u00a311bn Cadbury deal was a good one, says Cofer, who led the integration: \"We are on track if not ahead of plan on everything we had hoped for. We created a business that grew faster than its separate parts.\" Costs as a percentage of sales decreased from 17.7% in 2009 to 14.2% in 2011 as savings made from bashing the two companies together were realised. Despite reports of mass defections, Cofer insists the group \"retained key talent\": former Cadbury executives Ruslan Kinebas and Andrew Gibson sit on the European leadership team while former UK managing director Trevor Bond is Cofer's counterpart in central and eastern Europe. \"We have legacy Cadbury folks leading categories, geographies and functions,\" he says, before stressing that it's not all about Cadbury. \"The same would apply for LU. On the sixth floor we have a fantastic collection of legacy LU folks. We are investing to bring together three legacy companies: Kraft, Cadbury and LU.\" But with the tax affairs of multinationals coming under increasing scrutiny, Kraft faced criticism when it shifted ownership of some of the UK companies to a Swiss holding company. There are \"many reasons\" to choose a Swiss base other than tax, insists Cofer, who says the company complies with \"all applicable tax legislation\" in the UK. \"Mondelez International pays corporation tax based on the laws of the jurisdictions in which it operates,\" he says, adding that Kraft has had a Swiss base for more than 50 years. \"It's not a new 'hey let's go to Switzerland'. From a talent attraction standpoint, it's a great place to live. It's no hardship to live in Zurich.\" If British consumers are perturbed about the fate of Cadbury under its latest new ownership, they are not showing it. The latest Nielsen data put the brand's UK market share at 29%, up 0.2% on the previous year. \"Our market share in the UK with Cadbury Dairy Milk has hit a record high,\" says Cofer. \"In the end the British customer is voting with her pounds and voting quite favourably.\"",

      "body": "<p>L\u00f6rrach, on the edge of the Black Forest, may be 700 miles away from Cadbury's historic home of Bournville, but it too can lay claim to a chocolate-making tradition dating back more than 100 years.</p> <p>The picture-postcard town is home to Milka, Germany's favourite chocolate bar; the factory gates are close enough to the Alps to receive milk from the herds grazing in the mountain meadows. Here too, a purple corporate livery is much in evidence \u2013 although Milka's art-nouveau lilac is of a distinctly lighter shade than Cadbury's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/oct/03/cadbury-trademark-colour-purple-open-thread\" title=\"\">now trademarked Pantone 2685C</a>. And both are now outposts of the sprawling Kraft global empire.</p> <p>Plant manager Peter Jungbeck says: \"L\u00f6rrach is like Bournville. They have been making chocolate for 170 years and we have been doing it for 130. The people are very proud that a brand like Milka is in their city.\" With 3m bars rolling off its production lines each day, Milka is the biggest local employer.</p> <p>Like Cadbury, it was once part of a family-run business, started by Swiss chocolatier Philippe Suchard, but it became part of Kraft following the 1990 takeover of Jacobs Suchard and is now one of its biggest brands, with annual sales of more than $1bn and spinoffs such as biscuits, cheese spread and hot chocolate. The Suchard name, in its classic gold embossed lettering, disappeared from the packets long ago.</p> <p>Cadbury was swallowed up by Kraft in 2010 after one of the hardest-fought takeovers in recent memory \u2013 but with the ink barely dry on the new stationery, it was all change again last month as the US group went ahead with a surprise demerger that saw more than 100 of its snack brands, including Cadbury, Milka, Toblerone and Oreo, spun off under the newly created banner of Mondelez International.</p> <p>The shakeup, unions fear, could spell change for 6,500 staff in the UK and Ireland, not least because factory workers are no longer protected by a pledge of no compulsory redundancies. The promise, which expired in March, was extracted from Kraft after it was called to account by parliament for reneging on the closure of the Cadbury plant at Somerdale near Bristol.</p> <p>Jennie Formby, national officer for food and drink industries at the union Unite, is concerned after 200 positions were cut at the end of last year: \"We never thought sites would close straight away, but there are certainly vulnerabilities \u2013 not just in the UK and Ireland but in the whole of&#xa0;Europe.\"</p> <p>At the Light Cube, a glass office block in Zurich, Mondelez's European head, Tim Cofer, met the press for the first time last week and waxed enthusiastic about the outlook for the month-old company \u2013 which, despite the split, is still the world's biggest chocolate and biscuit manufacturer with annual sales of $36bn.</p> <p>What was previously Kraft's European base is emblazoned with the company's garish new logo \u2013 also purple \u2013 and Cofer, a high-flier with the ear of group chief executive Irene Rosenfeld, insists the logic for the split was \"compelling\", creating two companies with different specialities and geographical footprints.</p> <p>But with 59 factories in Europe, the business is a jigsaw of assets amassed on an acquisition trail that has included Jacobs Suchard, Danone's biscuit arm Lef\u00e8vre-Utile (LU) \u2013 maker of classic French biscuits such as Petit Beurre \u2013 and most recently Cadbury. Cofer admits: \"There will be change over the coming years as we look for the most efficient network in the industry to support this snacking company. Our portfolio is too complicated, we have too many product lines and can unlock benefits from simplifying our portfolio.\"</p> <p>With nearly half its sales rung up in emerging markets, Cofer says Mondelez offers investors \"exposure to a higher growth profile\", and with eyes firmly on the demerger, he is eager to drive the corporate message home: \"This is not the old Kraft Foods \u2013 this is Mondelez International and we are a global company.\"</p> <p>The European business is also a big piece of the Mondelez pie, accounting for nearly 40% of sales, whereas North America, where it retains its listing, contributes less than a fifth of turnover.</p> <p>The opposite is true of the other half of the demerger, which will retain its original name. Kraft, famously described by one Cadbury descendant as that \"plastic cheese company\", will now account for turnover of around $19bn, having been left with a larder full of US grocery brands such as Miracle Whip, Jell-O and Kool-Aid.</p> <p>From Kraft's standpoint the \u00a311bn Cadbury deal was a good one, says Cofer, who led the integration: \"We are on track if not ahead of plan on everything we had hoped for. We created a business that grew faster than its separate parts.\" Costs as a percentage of sales decreased from 17.7% in 2009 to 14.2% in 2011 as savings made from bashing the two companies together were realised.</p> <p>Despite reports of mass defections, Cofer insists the group \"retained key talent\": former Cadbury executives Ruslan Kinebas and Andrew Gibson sit on the European leadership team while former UK managing director Trevor Bond is Cofer's counterpart in central and eastern Europe.</p> <p>\"We have legacy Cadbury folks leading categories, geographies and functions,\" he says, before stressing that it's not all about Cadbury. \"The same would apply for LU. On the sixth floor we have a fantastic collection of legacy LU folks. We are investing to bring together three legacy companies: Kraft, Cadbury and LU.\"</p> <p>But with the tax affairs of multinationals coming under increasing scrutiny, Kraft faced criticism when it shifted ownership of some of the UK companies to a Swiss holding company.</p> <p>There are \"many reasons\" to choose a Swiss base other than tax, insists Cofer, who says the company complies with \"all applicable tax legislation\" in the UK. \"Mondelez International pays corporation tax based on the laws of the jurisdictions in which it operates,\" he says, adding that Kraft has had a Swiss base for more than 50 years. \"It's not a new 'hey let's go to Switzerland'. From a talent attraction standpoint, it's a great place to live. It's no hardship to live in Zurich.\"</p> <p>If British consumers are perturbed about the fate of Cadbury under its latest new ownership, they are not showing it. The latest Nielsen data put the brand's UK market share at 29%, up 0.2% on the previous year.</p> <p>\"Our market share in the UK with Cadbury Dairy Milk has hit a record high,\" says Cofer. \"In the end the British customer is voting with her pounds and voting quite favourably.\"</p>",
