      "bodyText": "The hunt was on today to find out just when the UK has last suffered such a deep recession followed by such a feeble recovery. Worse than the early 1990s? The slump that followed the Lawson boom of the late 1980s is not even in the same league as the recent downturn. Deeper than the decimation of Britain's industrial heartlands in the early 1980s? Yes, and by this stage three decades ago the economy was bouncing back with vigour. Worse than the Great Depression of the 1930s? Amazingly, that is what the data suggests, not least because Britain stole a march on the rest of the world by being the first country to come off the Gold Standard in September 1931. Michael Saunders of Citigroup won the prize for the most bearish comparison, noting that the record of the past five years was the weakest UK recession-recovery in the past 100 years (world wars excluded). And, judging by today's updated estimate of the economy's performance in the final three months of 2011 this long and miserable saga is not over yet. Here's what we know. There has been no growth in the economy since September 2010, with three quarters of falling output punctuated by two quarters of expansion. To all intents and purposes Britain has had a double dip recession, even though the technical definition of two successive quarters of negative growth has not been met. The problem, despite the misleading spin put on the figures by the Treasury today, has not been exports and it has not been the crisis in the eurozone. Net trade contributed to growth last year: without a narrowing of the current account growth would have been lower than the 0.7% actually recorded in 2011. Instead, the real drag on the economy has been household consumption, by far the biggest element of gross domestic product. This fell dramatically during the deep slump of 2008-09, recovered slightly in late 2009 and 2010, and then declined for a further 12 months until picking up in the final three months of 2011. Consumers were hard hit last year by rising inflation, which topped 5% as a result of rising oil prices, the increase in VAT and the higher cost of imported goods caused by a lower pound. Prices were going up far more rapidly than earnings, which is why real incomes (ie adjusted for prices) fell more strongly than at any time since 1977. Nick Parsons, chief strategist at National Australia Bank, notes that in the cycles of the early 1980s and early 1990s, the economy really started to motor 13 quarters after the downturn began, but that hasn't happened this time. In the 1980s, falling oil prices and financial deregulation helped boost activity; in the early 1990s the fillip came from leaving the Exchange Rate Mechanism. This time all the recent shocks - oil prices, the Japanese tsunami, the euro debt crisis - have been negative. Add these unfortunate events to an economy that is structurally flawed and what do you get? A lost decade.",

Consumers were hard hit last year by rising inflation, which topped 5% as a result of rising oil prices, the increase in VAT and the higher cost of imported goods caused by a lower pound. Prices were going up far more rapidly than earnings, which is why real incomes (ie adjusted for prices) fell more strongly than at any time since 1977.</p> <p>Nick Parsons, chief strategist at National Australia Bank, notes that in the cycles of the early 1980s and early 1990s, the economy really started to motor 13 quarters after the downturn began, but that hasn't happened this time. In the 1980s, falling oil prices and financial deregulation helped boost activity; in the early 1990s the fillip came from leaving the Exchange Rate Mechanism.</p> <p>This time all the recent shocks - oil prices, the Japanese tsunami, the euro debt crisis - have been negative. Add these unfortunate events to an economy that is structurally flawed and what do you get? A lost decade.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Insurers may have to pay out as much as \u00a35bn to relatives of those who have died from asbestos-related cancers following a supreme court judgment that will benefit thousands of families.</p> <p>At the end of a legal battle that has lasted more than five years, justices at the country's highest court ruled by a four to one majority that insurance companies' liability had been triggered when individuals were exposed to asbestos dust \u2013 not when symptoms of the connected condition, mesothelioma, emerged decades later. Some claims date back to the late 1940s. The supreme court ruled that the disease could be said to have been \"sustained\" or \"contracted\" \u2013 the wording varied between company insurance policies \u2013 by an employee in the period when it was caused or initiated, even if it only developed or manifested itself later.</p> <p>Lord Clarke said: \"The negligent exposure of an employee to asbestos during the [insurance] policy period has a sufficient causal link with subsequently arising mesothelioma to trigger the insurer's obligation.\"</p> <p>Britain and Ireland's largest trade union, Unite, welcomed the \"landmark\" ruling, which it said would affect \"many of the 2,500 people who are diagnosed with mesothelioma each year\". Its challenge was on behalf of the family of Charles O'Farrell, a retired member who died of mesothelioma in 2003.</p> <p>Lawyers and the insurance industry have estimated the liability at between \u00a3600m and \u00a35bn. Municipal Mutual Insurance (MMI), one of the insurance firms that appealed against the compensation ordered by lower courts, said it had already been paying out to local authority employers for mesothelioma claims, despite not being obliged to do so until the outcome of the case was known.</p> <p>Commenting on the supreme court's decision, the Unite general secretary, Len McCluskey, said: \"This is a landmark ruling which will affect thousands of victims of asbestos.</p> <p>\"It is a disgrace that insurance companies went to such lengths to shirk their responsibilities. For callous insurers this means the responsibility holiday is over. Unite fought this case to the highest court to get justice for Charles, his family and all victims of asbestos.</p> <p>O'Farrell's daughter, Maureen Edwards, said: \"All I ever prayed for was the right decision. This is the right decision. My dad worked all his life and was hoping to enjoy retirement before mesothelioma took him away.</p> <p>\"There was never any question about who was to blame \u2013 all this long battle was about was insurers wanting to get out of paying. It is very difficult for us to understand the insurance industry's attitude to dying people, an attitude that the government [legal reforms are] going to make worse.\"</p> <p>Helen Ashton, from the law firm Irwin Mitchell, who represented the lead claimant in the case, said the ruling provided \"clarity, consistency and comfort for mesothelioma victims and their families\".</p> <p>The ruling was welcomed as a \"great relief\" by Ruth Durham, who had continued the legal battle in memory of her father Leslie Screach. He died in 2003 after being exposed to asbestos fibres between 1963 and 1968 while working as a paint sprayer in west London.</p> <p>His daughter said: \"I was determined to see this through with a positive outcome for all those who, like my dad, suffered so terribly because of someone else's negligence.

      "bodyText": "Insurers may have to pay out as much as \u00a35bn to relatives of those who have died from asbestos-related cancers following a supreme court judgment that will benefit thousands of families. At the end of a legal battle that has lasted more than five years, justices at the country's highest court ruled by a four to one majority that insurance companies' liability had been triggered when individuals were exposed to asbestos dust \u2013 not when symptoms of the connected condition, mesothelioma, emerged decades later. Some claims date back to the late 1940s. The supreme court ruled that the disease could be said to have been \"sustained\" or \"contracted\" \u2013 the wording varied between company insurance policies \u2013 by an employee in the period when it was caused or initiated, even if it only developed or manifested itself later. Lord Clarke said: \"The negligent exposure of an employee to asbestos during the [insurance] policy period has a sufficient causal link with subsequently arising mesothelioma to trigger the insurer's obligation.\" Britain and Ireland's largest trade union, Unite, welcomed the \"landmark\" ruling, which it said would affect \"many of the 2,500 people who are diagnosed with mesothelioma each year\". Its challenge was on behalf of the family of Charles O'Farrell, a retired member who died of mesothelioma in 2003. Lawyers and the insurance industry have estimated the liability at between \u00a3600m and \u00a35bn. Municipal Mutual Insurance (MMI), one of the insurance firms that appealed against the compensation ordered by lower courts, said it had already been paying out to local authority employers for mesothelioma claims, despite not being obliged to do so until the outcome of the case was known. Commenting on the supreme court's decision, the Unite general secretary, Len McCluskey, said: \"This is a landmark ruling which will affect thousands of victims of asbestos. \"It is a disgrace that insurance companies went to such lengths to shirk their responsibilities. For callous insurers this means the responsibility holiday is over. Unite fought this case to the highest court to get justice for Charles, his family and all victims of asbestos. O'Farrell's daughter, Maureen Edwards, said: \"All I ever prayed for was the right decision. This is the right decision. My dad worked all his life and was hoping to enjoy retirement before mesothelioma took him away. \"There was never any question about who was to blame \u2013 all this long battle was about was insurers wanting to get out of paying. It is very difficult for us to understand the insurance industry's attitude to dying people, an attitude that the government [legal reforms are] going to make worse.\" Helen Ashton, from the law firm Irwin Mitchell, who represented the lead claimant in the case, said the ruling provided \"clarity, consistency and comfort for mesothelioma victims and their families\". The ruling was welcomed as a \"great relief\" by Ruth Durham, who had continued the legal battle in memory of her father Leslie Screach. He died in 2003 after being exposed to asbestos fibres between 1963 and 1968 while working as a paint sprayer in west London. His daughter said: \"I was determined to see this through with a positive outcome for all those who, like my dad, suffered so terribly because of someone else's negligence. I miss him every day and no sum of money will ever bring him back or make up for what he went through.\" Nick Starling, the Association of British Insurers (ABI) director of general insurance and health, said: \"[This] ruling by the supreme court has confirmed what most in the industry have always understood \u2013 that the insurer on cover when the claimant was exposed to asbestos should pay the claim, rather than the insurer on cover when the mesothelioma develops. \"This case has been pursued by a small group of 'runoff' insurers acting independently and at odds with the views of the majority of the UK insurance industry. We are pleased that the supreme court has overruled the court of appeal's judgment on this point as it ensures that claimants should get the compensation they reasonably expect.\" MMI said it had participated in the joint action to determine the extent of the company's insurance liabilities under policies it wrote in the period up to September 1992 when it ceased writing new insurance business.",

The Thai floods, in October, were the biggest disaster for Lloyd's in term of payouts last year, with total claims estimated at \u00a31.4bn. Richard Ward, Lloyd's chief executive, said the area flooded in Thailand was the equivalent of \"seven industrial parks the size of Birmingham \u2013 and they remained underwater for a couple of months\". He said the Thai floods were a \"double whammy\" for Japan because 80% of the buildings were owned by Japanese technology companies, many of which had transferred production to Thailand following the country's devastating earthquake and tsunami in March. Ward said \u00a31.2bn of tsunami payouts were lower than for the Thai floods because Japanese companies tended to insure their businesses with local insurers.

The split will infuriate campaigners who want the regulator to take an activist role in preventing another house price bubble. Minutes of the FPC meeting show that members agreed on the need to \"avoid an excessively activist, fine-tuning approach in setting sectoral capital requirements\" that would prevent riskier parts of the finance industry from excessive lending. They agreed to recommend to the Treasury a broader approach to setting capital buffers that in the case of banks and building societies could rely on existing international rules. The FPC is due to take over from the Financial Services Authority next year as the main City watchdog.

In November, it was plunged into a fresh crisis when grim trading forced it to turn to its lenders for financial help. The banks came through with a \u00a3200m lifeline but many of Thomas Cook's problems persist.</p> <p>The company has long suffered from the rise of online travel agents, as well as continuing pressure on consumer spending. Analysts say its well-publicised financial troubles have also damaged its reputation with hoteliers and customers.</p> <p>Investec, which rates the shares a \"buy\", said on Wednesday: \"Thomas Cook is facing continued difficult trading conditions across Europe and it needs to rigorously address its cost base, particularly in the UK. This is made more difficult without a permanent chief executive and we are disappointed that an appointment has not been announced today.\"</p> <p>Overall bookings for summer 2012 were down 2% in the UK, with the drop in mainstream holiday bookings partially offset by a 14% increase in specialist and independent holidays. Thomas Cook said all-inclusive holidays were selling particularly well, because they helped cash-strapped customers stick to holiday budgets.</p> <p>It said it had cut capacity of mainstream holidays by 12%, but pricing had held up, rising 4% compared with last year. Outside the UK, summer bookings were slower than expected in northern, western and eastern Europe.</p> <p>The winter season, which Thomas Cook counts as October to April, remained \"subdued\", although bookings have improved in recent weeks.

      "bodyText": "Britain's squeezed middle are cutting back on holidays to the Canary Islands and similar destinations, adding to the woes of Thomas Cook. The world's oldest travel company has seen a 10% drop in bookings for mainstream summer holidays \u2013 its core business of sending families off on package tours to such destinations as the Canaries and Balearics. The Association of British Travel Agents said it was an industry-wide trend, with a drop in \"mainstream, squeezed-middle, bucket and spade in Spain-type holidays\" as families cut back in the downturn. It is just one of the many problems faced by Thomas Cook, which also failed to announce a new chief executive on Wednesday, despite assurances someone would be appointed to the job by the end of March. Thomas Cook shares have slumped 86% over the past year as it issued a string of profit warnings, leading to the departure of former chief executive Manny Fontenla-Novoa. In November, it was plunged into a fresh crisis when grim trading forced it to turn to its lenders for financial help. The banks came through with a \u00a3200m lifeline but many of Thomas Cook's problems persist. The company has long suffered from the rise of online travel agents, as well as continuing pressure on consumer spending. Analysts say its well-publicised financial troubles have also damaged its reputation with hoteliers and customers. Investec, which rates the shares a \"buy\", said on Wednesday: \"Thomas Cook is facing continued difficult trading conditions across Europe and it needs to rigorously address its cost base, particularly in the UK. This is made more difficult without a permanent chief executive and we are disappointed that an appointment has not been announced today.\" Overall bookings for summer 2012 were down 2% in the UK, with the drop in mainstream holiday bookings partially offset by a 14% increase in specialist and independent holidays. Thomas Cook said all-inclusive holidays were selling particularly well, because they helped cash-strapped customers stick to holiday budgets. It said it had cut capacity of mainstream holidays by 12%, but pricing had held up, rising 4% compared with last year. Outside the UK, summer bookings were slower than expected in northern, western and eastern Europe. The winter season, which Thomas Cook counts as October to April, remained \"subdued\", although bookings have improved in recent weeks. Trips from the UK to Tunisia, in particular, have picked up, after a drop in travel to the Middle East and north Africa during the Arab spring of 2011. Thomas Cook said: \"We continue to expect 2011-12 to be a challenging year given the economic backdrop and difficult trading environment, particularly for winter. The trends which we saw in the first quarter have continued through the second quarter, but summer trading is more encouraging.\" There had been an improvement in the UK over the past few weeks, it added, helped by the recent advertising campaign and upgrades to its website. Simon French, at Panmure Gordon, said consensus forecasts for full-year earnings before interest and tax would probably drop to around \u00a3200m following the statement, compared with \u00a3304m in 2011. He said the group's balance sheet remained stretched and that level of profitability would put pressure on bank covenants due to be tested in December. \"More disposals will therefore be needed and we question whether there is a viable, sustainable, ongoing business,\" he said.

Overall the economy grew 0.7% in 2011.</p> <h2>Vicky Redwood, chief UK economist at Capital Economics</h2> <p>The slight downward revision to GDP in Q4 is disappointing, although of course this is fairly old news now and it looks as though the economy recovered somewhat in the first quarter \u2026 At least there were some encouraging aspects to the detail. Although the household saving rate nudged down in Q4, the back-data have been revised up a fair bit. So it now looks like households' finances are in a bit better condition than before. What's more, the balance of payments figures show that the current account deficit fell sharply, reflecting both the drop in the trade deficit and a rise in the investment income surplus. Meanwhile, it looks as though the economy has managed to expand in Q1. Nonetheless, we still think that there are a number of reasons to doubt that the recovery can maintain the recent acceleration.</p> <h2>David Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce</h2> <p>Although the fall in investment was much smaller than expected, the improvement in net exports was not as strong as we had hoped.</p> <p>The UK economy faces huge challenges, but we still believe that GDP has returned to positive growth in the first quarter of 2012 and there will be no new recession. But the austerity measures and unresolved problems in the eurozone will continue to put pressure on the economy, so it is crucial that policies to support growth are put at the top of the agenda.</p> <p>The recent budget has not done enough to benefit small- and medium-sized businesses. More must be done as a matter of urgency to help firms create jobs, export and invest.</p> <h2>Jonathan Portes, director of NIESR</h2> <p>We knew the last three months of last year were pretty bad, and these figures show they were slightly worse than we thought. There has clearly been some pickup in the early months of this year \u2026 but it does emphasise what a bad year 2011 was for the UK economy.</p> <h2>Michael Hewson, senior market analyst at CMC Markets</h2> <p>This disappointing revision in Q4 GDP makes it all the more important that the Q1 numbers come in showing some semblance of a recovery in the growth picture. It would certainly need Q1 growth of at least 0.4% to keep the economy moving higher on an annualised basis, after the annual figure for Q4 dropped from 0.7% to 0.5%.</p> <p>There was some evidence of a silver lining as business investment came in slightly higher than expected. It was still negative for the quarter but managed to recover into positive territory on the annual measure.</p> <p>Given the reliance of the UK economy on the consumer it remains doubtful that any growth in Q1 will be sustained into Q2 if recent UK retail sales data is any guide.</p> <h2>John Hawksworth, PwC's chief economist</h2> <p>These historic data revisions do not affect the outlook in a significant way, with our main scenario still being that UK growth will be bumpy but modestly positive on average at 0.6% in 2012, picking up to 1.8% in 2013. Downside risks from the eurozone crisis have moderated since last December, but rising oil prices have emerged as a concern that could prolong the inflationary squeeze on consumers.</p> <h2>Ranvir Singh, CEO of market analysts RANsquawk</h2> <p>This revision down is no mere academic exercise. Behind that negative number is the first fall in service sector output for a year. Rather than being flat in the last quarter of 2011, it fell by 0.1%. For a country which has the service sector as the engine room of its economy, that's very worrying news. Sterling promptly fell on the currency markets as a result.</p> <p>The first quarter of 2012 has got off to a much stronger start, but even so growth is likely to be flat or insipid at best. So while the UK will probably dodge the bullet of a technical recession when the Q1 numbers come out, it remains deeply fragile.</p> <h2>Jason Conibear at Cambridge Mercantile</h2> <p>It's not as bad as we thought. It's worse. Sterling hit the deck on the back of this downward revision. And it could be a long count before it gets back up on its feet. What this revision to the Q4 data reinforces is that the UK economy is febrile at best. The consensus appears to be that we will avoid a technical recession due to an improvement during the first quarter of this year but there's still a very recessionary feel to the current climate. Once again, this could resurrect the QE debate \u2013 and once again it confirms that Bank rate will stay put for potentially a considerable time.</p> <h2>Howard Archer, economist at IHS Global Insight</h2> <p>The sharper than previously reported drop in GDP in the fourth quarter of 2011 is obviously disappointing but it does not fundamentally change the story of an economy that saw fitful and muted overall growth in 2011, with a relapse in activity at the end of the year \u2026</p> <p>The economy has likely returned to growth in the first quarter of 2012. We expect the economy to have expanded by around 0.3% quarter-on-quarter although the marked drop in retail sales volumes in February suggests that the risks to this forecast are to the downside. And it still looks like economic activity will be muted overall and prone to relapses over the next few months at least before growth hopefully picks up on a more sustainable basis during the second half of the year. Much will depend on oil prices and how quickly and how far consumer price inflation retreats over the coming months, thereby easing the squeeze on consumers. UK growth prospects will also be vulnerable to any major renewed flaring up of problems in the eurozone</p> <h2>Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit</h2> <p>The downturn was broad-based, led by a 1.3% drop in industrial production, in part caused by a steep drop in demand for energy due to mild weather but also due to manufacturing output dropping 0.7%. Construction output also fell 0.7% and even service sector output dropped 0.1%.</p> <p>In contrast, government spending, household consumption and exports all grew, though are clearly not factors which can be expected to drive strong growth in the rest of the year. The government purse strings are being tightened, growth is deteriorating in key export markets (with the eurozone now likely to be in another recession), and revised retail sales data have signalled a far weaker start to the year than previously thought, raising concerns that households are continuing to retrench amid worries about the economy, jobs and rising prices.</p> <h2>Daniel Solomon, Centre for Economics and Business Research</h2> <p>Since the end of 2011 a flurry of positive economic data and encouraging policy announcements have indicated that the UK is likely to avoid technical recession in 2012. Currently, we expect GDP to grow by 0.4% over the year. This is due to domestic and foreign loose monetary policy and falling inflation \u2026 Encouraging monetary policy at home and abroad, with a modest re-stabilisation of household finances mean that the UK should avoid recession this year. This is an encouraging result given how likely a double-dip appeared to be at the end of last year.</p>",

So while the UK will probably dodge the bullet of a technical recession when the Q1 numbers come out, it remains deeply fragile. Jason Conibear at Cambridge Mercantile It's not as bad as we thought. It's worse. Sterling hit the deck on the back of this downward revision. And it could be a long count before it gets back up on its feet. What this revision to the Q4 data reinforces is that the UK economy is febrile at best. The consensus appears to be that we will avoid a technical recession due to an improvement during the first quarter of this year but there's still a very recessionary feel to the current climate. Once again, this could resurrect the QE debate \u2013 and once again it confirms that Bank rate will stay put for potentially a considerable time. Howard Archer, economist at IHS Global Insight The sharper than previously reported drop in GDP in the fourth quarter of 2011 is obviously disappointing but it does not fundamentally change the story of an economy that saw fitful and muted overall growth in 2011, with a relapse in activity at the end of the year \u2026 The economy has likely returned to growth in the first quarter of 2012. We expect the economy to have expanded by around 0.3% quarter-on-quarter although the marked drop in retail sales volumes in February suggests that the risks to this forecast are to the downside. And it still looks like economic activity will be muted overall and prone to relapses over the next few months at least before growth hopefully picks up on a more sustainable basis during the second half of the year. Much will depend on oil prices and how quickly and how far consumer price inflation retreats over the coming months, thereby easing the squeeze on consumers. UK growth prospects will also be vulnerable to any major renewed flaring up of problems in the eurozone Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit The downturn was broad-based, led by a 1.3% drop in industrial production, in part caused by a steep drop in demand for energy due to mild weather but also due to manufacturing output dropping 0.7%. Construction output also fell 0.7% and even service sector output dropped 0.1%. In contrast, government spending, household consumption and exports all grew, though are clearly not factors which can be expected to drive strong growth in the rest of the year. The government purse strings are being tightened, growth is deteriorating in key export markets (with the eurozone now likely to be in another recession), and revised retail sales data have signalled a far weaker start to the year than previously thought, raising concerns that households are continuing to retrench amid worries about the economy, jobs and rising prices. Daniel Solomon, Centre for Economics and Business Research Since the end of 2011 a flurry of positive economic data and encouraging policy announcements have indicated that the UK is likely to avoid technical recession in 2012. Currently, we expect GDP to grow by 0.4% over the year. This is due to domestic and foreign loose monetary policy and falling inflation \u2026 Encouraging monetary policy at home and abroad, with a modest re-stabilisation of household finances mean that the UK should avoid recession this year. This is an encouraging result given how likely a double-dip appeared to be at the end of last year.",

General Motors has confirmed that the fate of 2,100 employees at the Wirral site will not be decided at a board meeting on Wednesday. A spokeswoman for Opel/Vauxhall, GM's European arm, said a meeting of the unit's supervisory board in Germany would not discuss the factory closures. Sources close to high-level discussions between GM, politicians and trade unions about the future of Ellesmere Port and a sister plant in Bochum, Germany \u2013 the most seriously threatened sites \u2013 had identified the 28 March meeting as a crucial gathering, but decisions on capacity reductions now appear to have been delayed. \"The subject of plant closures is not on the agenda,\" said a Vauxhall spokeswoman.

The undecided issue is no longer whether GM has a manufacturing supply problem, but how to deal with it. The delay has also taken place against the backdrop of vociferous campaigning against the threat of an Opel plant closure in Bochum, in Germany's western industrial heartlands. Employees represented by the Opel Bochum Works Council and IG Metall, a major trade union, have publicly warned GM that closing the plant will be prohibitively expensive and will damage the Opel brand, turning its market share in Germany \"to dust\". Employees and union officials say the plant is the biggest single employer in the Bochum region and its closure will threaten a further 45,000 jobs in secondary industries. Like Ellesmere Port, the plant marks its 50th birthday this year. It is also receiving backing from politicians, with a representative from the local government expected to attend a workers' gathering on Saturday. David Bailey, a professor at Coventry University and car industry commentator, said the UK government might have to follow Germany's example. \"Despite the odds stacked against them, everyone from unions to the regional government is mobilising and attempting to make it as difficult as possible for General Motors.\"",

      "bodyText": "Britain's economy was even weaker than expected at the end of last year, underlining the country's struggle to avoid another recession. GDP fell 0.3% in the fourth quarter, more than the 0.2% drop previously estimated by the Office for National Statistics. The downgrade was mainly prompted by weakness in the country's dominant services sector. Economists had not been expecting any change to the 0.2% fall, and the news that Britain's economy went into the new year in an even worse state will raise fears it could notch up a technical recession \u2013 defined as two consecutive quarters of contraction. The pound fell to a two-week low against the euro on the surprise downgrade, which left growth for the year as a whole at just 0.7%, down from 0.8% pencilled in previously. \"Sterling hit the deck on the back of this downward revision. And it could be a long count before it gets back up on its feet,\" said Jason Conibear at foreign exchange group Cambridge Mercantile. \"What this revision to the fourth-quarter data reinforces is that the UK economy is febrile at best. The consensus appears to be that we will avoid a technical recession due to an improvement during the first quarter of this year but there's still a very recessionary feel to the current climate.\" The signs from business surveys and much of the official data so far for this first quarter have been taken as evidence of at least a small new-year bounce-back. But there are widespread doubts over whether that can be sustained. Economists cite many headwinds facing the UK economy, including high oil prices, a government austerity drive and the sovereign debt crisis in the eurozone. The outlook for households remains tough. Underscoring fears that consumers are being squeezed by high inflation and strains from government cuts and high unemployment, disposable incomes in 2011 slumped at their fastest pace for more than 30 years, the ONS said. They were down 1.2%, the biggest fall since 1977. In the fourth quarter household spending picked up to grow by 0.4%, offsetting the 0.3% fall in the previous quarter, but that came as people ate into their savings. The breakdown of the GDP data also showed that while service sector weakness prompted the downward revision, the overall drop was led by a fall in industrial production as manufacturing shrank. There was also a fall in construction output as well as a dip in service sector output. Government spending, exports and household consumption grew, but economists warned that pattern had little chance of holding up. \"The government purse strings are being tightened, growth is deteriorating in key export markets, with the eurozone now likely to be in another recession, and revised retail sales data have signalled a far weaker start to the year than previously thought, raising concerns that households are continuing to retrench amid worries about the economy, jobs and rising prices,\" said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit. Williamson said the closely watched purchasing managers business surveys (PMIs) so far for 2012 pointed to \"a meagre 0.3% expansion, which would merely make up for the lost output in the final quarter of last year\". Other economists echoed that prediction of a small recovery at the start of this year, albeit weak and hard to sustain. \"It looks as though the economy has managed to expand in the first quarter. Nonetheless, we still think that there are a number of reasons to doubt that the recovery can maintain the recent acceleration,\" said Vicky Redwood, chief UK economist at Capital Economics. Ed Balls, the shadow chancellor, said the revision was \"very worrying news\". \"It's now even clearer that last week's budget not only made the wrong choice by asking millions to pay more so millionaires could pay less, it also made the wrong choice in sticking to policies that are failing on jobs, growth and the deficit,\" he said.",

      "bodyText": "Britain's first high-speed rail line was built on \"hugely optimistic\" forecasts for passenger demand that never materialised, leaving taxpayers exposed to billions in losses, according to the National Audit Office (NAO). Revenue expected to cover debts guaranteed by the Department for Transport fell far short, with only two-thirds of the predicted international passengers eventually using the Eurostar to London, a report has found. The \u00a36.2bn bill for the line was also 18% higher than the original target \u2013 although the NAO said that figure compared well with some other rail projects, which came in up to 240% over budget in the case of the west coast mainline upgrade. Although the report found that the money had delivered a high-performing line that had eventually been successfully sold off to limit taxpayers' exposure, the NAO warned that in future \"departments should ensure that demand forecasts are subject to rigorous scrutiny and scepticism\". The findings will give further ammunition to critics of HS2, the \u00a333bn high-speed rail network given the green light by the government earlier this year. After the economic case for HS2 was challenged repeatedly by opponents and its benefit-cost ratios were subsequently revised downwards, the DfT has largely based its arguments for the project on the need to increase capacity on inter-city railways to meet future demand. The transport secretary, Justine Greening, announced on Tuesday that the government would publish its plans for the second phase of HS2 in the autumn. The proposals could include options for stations in Manchester, Leeds, South Yorkshire, the East Midlands and at Heathrow airport. The route for the first phase of the project from London to Birmingham, unveiled earlier this year, is scheduled for completion by 2026, with the Y-shaped tracks further north to follow by 2032/33. Commenting on the NAO report, Margaret Hodge MP, chair of the House of Commons public accounts committee, said: \"Yet again we hear that value for money will depend on uncertain benefits which have not been quantified. It's a sad state of affairs when it comes as no surprise that HS1 was based on dodgy assumptions and bad planning.\" A spokesman for the DfT said it had \"significantly improved\" its passenger forecast modelling since the original work for HS1.
