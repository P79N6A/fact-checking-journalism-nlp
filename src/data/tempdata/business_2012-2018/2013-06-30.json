      "bodyText": "As Mark Carney arrives at the Bank of England to greet his staff, the new governor faces a severe test of the central bankers' dark arts. Hotfoot from his job as Canada's central bank boss, he must conjur sustained and strong growth from an economy that remains highly indebted, and is suffering from a lopsided recovery that favours services over manufacturing while the government prefers to hack at public spending with little thought for its long term impact while waiting for something to turn up. George Osborne wants the central bank to take the lead and lubricate the financial system with so much money that banks start lending to small businesses again. Carney, by all accounts wants to fulfil the chancellor's dreams. But will Carney match his undoubted finance skills with a magician's ability to turn rabbits into doves, or will the former Goldman Sachs banker find himself, like the Wizard of Oz, furiously pulling levers to no great effect? There are many observers who believe his job is more constrained than when he accepted Osborne's invitation last year to succeed Sir Mervyn King. The economy is growing, and while any recovery may still be fitful and fragile, it is enough for a majority of members of the monetary policy committee (MPC) to resist pumping in further cheap funds. Inflation remains above 2% and looks like staying above the target set by the government for several years. Martin Weale, the former head of the National Institute for Economic and Social Research (NIESR) and a long-standing MPC member said last week that he had blocked pumping further central bank funds into the financial system because he feared it would push inflation higher. A further modification of the MPC's remit could persuade Weale and the others to relax about inflation and agree to what until now would have been considered wild and reckless policies. The MPC has created \u00a3375bn of funds under its quantitative easing programme and could create much more. Three members of the committee, including King, have pushed for a \u00a325bn hike. Carney could also ask the committee to buy the high street banks' toxic debts, which are preventing them from meeting regulatory rules on having clean and detoxified reserves. He might not buy the worst stuff on the books of RBS and Lloyds, but he would only be following the US Federal Reserve if he found himself with several hundred millions pounds' worth of mortgage debt on the BoE's books. He could support an investment bank with central bank funds, as the British Chambers of Commerce have urged him to do, or set up an offshoot of the MPC to consider direct investment in house building through the bond market, as the New Economics foundation has requested. One of his most likely projects will be to persuade the MPC to back a commitment that interest rates stay low until a target on unemployment or growth is reached, much as the Fed has done. The aim would be to free consumers from the worry of rising rates and encourage them to buy something they have resisted purchasing, maybe a sofa, a car or even a house. Even if he is minded to take on the task of supporting a \u00a31bn investment bank and pumping countless millions into housebuilding, or providing some notice on the next interest rate rise, he faces several barriers. First there are the critics of the BoE's current policy, who say the UK's situation is better than supposed and in need of rate rises. According to monetarist economists, GDP growth so far this year is a sure sign that the economy is already back on track for good. Simon Ward, the chief economist at the fund manager Henderson Global Investors, reckons growth this year will be 2% and not the less than 1% predicted by mainstrean forecasters and the BoE. He said the demand for cash in instant deposit accounts, known as narrow money or M1, had surged since last summer, a situation ignored by the Bank of England. Arguably, much of the boost to spending in the last couple of years is a direct result of the PPI scandal, which has forced banks to pay compensation in the region of \u00a35bn and employ thousands of staff to handle the mess, also at a cost of more than \u00a35bn. Households and smaller companies also remain hugely indebted, placing a further drag on confidence and spending. If he can paint a gloomier picture of the economy and bypass his monetarist critics, there are six of the nine MPC members standing in his way. They may not be monetarists, but they remain wedded to the idea that the economy is finely balanced and that a wait-and-see policy is needed. Should they acquiesce, there would be another problem, in that monetary policy has not been the panacea some had hoped for. King championed a lower exchange rate. He said that devaluing the currency through printing extra sterling would help exporters and rebalance the economy. It's true that UK defence exports totalled \u00a38.8bn over the past year, a rise of 62% from 2011 and making Britain the second largest defence exporter after the US. Car exports are also up, transforming a \u00a37.5bn deficit in car exports in 2003 to break-even. Exports to emerging countries from Brazil to Indonesia are inching higher. But our biggest market, the EU, is in the doldrums and looks likely to be stuck in a cycle of low growth for some time. The BoE also seems to have underestimated the extent to which exporters are wrapped into long-term fixed contracts that are hedged against currency movements.

      "bodyText": "Business leaders urged Mark Carney on Sunday to back a \u00a31bn investment bank at his first meeting as governor of the Bank of England to kickstart lending to small businesses. The British Chamber of Commerce (BCC) also called on Carney, who takes over from Sir Mervyn Kingon Monday, to inject further funds into the economy as part of its quantitative easing (QE) programme to maintain the UK's fragile recovery. BCC director general, John Longworth, said Carney needed to find ways to channel money to manufacturers and smaller enterprises or risk the recovery running out of steam. \"While we are seeing signs of a stronger recovery across the business community, we have no illusions about the challenges ahead for the UK economy,\" he said. The Bank of England's interest rate setting committee is expected to reject boosting QE beyond its current \u00a3375bn level at its monthly meeting on Thursday, despite the arrival of Carney amid a welter of expectations that he will spur his colleagues into action. City analysts agree that the monetary policy committee will hold its fire until the publication of a review in August of its policies, which will broaden its remit and encourage committee members to adopt a more radical mix of initiatives. A report by the Bank's officials into the prospects for rising prices is also likely to show inflation falling over the next two years, giving the MPC more leeway to boost QE. The chancellor wants the committee to take a more active role in encouraging lenders to promote borrowing to the wider economy.

A funding for lending scheme designed to cut the cost of borrowing has pushed down the cost of mortgages since it was launched last year, but has so far had little effect on business lending. A leading thinktank called on Carney to bypass the main banks with a direct intervention into the housing industry to support the building of 60,000 homes.

    "webTitle": "Ian Hannam may need reinforcements for FSA hearing", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "There was a time when Ian Hannam was considered something of a City celebrity as the most sucked up to corporate financier in the Square Mile. \"Perhaps the City's top dealmaker,\" gushed the London Evening Standard; \"One of the City of London's most prolific merger advisers,\" purred the Sunday Telegraph, and if you suspected that period was the top of the market for Hannam's reputation, you were spot on. With hindsight, the heroic deals now seem to range from the disastrous (Bumi, Kazakhmys) to the painful (Genel), as well as the controversial (Glencore Xstrata) to the very decent (BHP Billiton). This week Hannam will fight to restore another thread of his image when he appeals against last year's \u00a3450,000 Financial Services Authority fine for market abuse, with the start of a financial services and markets tribunal hearing. The FSA found that Hannam sent two emails disclosing inside information about his client, Heritage Oil, but the banker will argue his words were too vague to be considered significant. If that battle plan fails, the former Territorial Army captain might send for reinforcements, with his troops whispering that Tony Buckingham, the notoriously shy former mercenary and Heritage Oil boss, could be drafted in. Developing, as they say. Rising interest for payday lenders Interest in payday lenders is rising faster than repayments on one of their overdue loans. After the Office of Fair Trading asked for a review into the sector last week, following its discovery of deep-rooted problems in the way vulnerable customers are treated, representatives from the \u00a32bn-a-year industry will tomorrow potter along to Whitehall, where they have been summoned for a meeting with the government's consumer minister Jo Swinson \u2013 plus financial regulators and debt charities \u2013 to discuss whether more regulation is needed to protect borrowers. Figures from the debt charity StepChange show that between 2011 and 2012 the average payday-loan debt of its London-based clients rose by \u00a3563 to \u00a31,859, as annual interest rates on some loans top 5,000%. That is just the sort of inconvenient statistic that makes this topic so tricky for lenders to spin, although inevitably there is a trade association on hand to have a go. Russell Hamblin-Boone, head of the Consumer Finance Association (CFA), says: \"We look forward to the opportunity to engage in open and honest dialogue with the government, regulators, consumer groups and debt charities\" \u2013 so we can assume payday lenders are backing reform 5,235%. Libor teaser We've known for a while that Libor isn't working, and we'll get another look at just how badly things went wrong on Thursday when Southwark crown court hosts Tom Hayes. He's the 33-year-old former trader at investment banks Citigroup and UBS, whose sole claim to fame is that he's the only banker yet to have been charged by the Serious Fraud Office with rigging Libor, following allegations that he conspired with Royal Bank of Scotland, JP Morgan Chase, Deutsche Bank, Rabobank, RP Martin, HSBC, Icap and Tullett Prebon to manipulate the world's interest rate benchmark. All of the firms named either decline to comment or reiterate that they're assisting authorities with their inquiries, but the intriguing name on the list is Tullett as (a) it maintains it has no evidence suggesting its brokers acted improperly or are under investigation, and (b) the firm's chief executive, Terry Smith, has been an outspoken advocate of prosecuting anyone caught fiddling the rate. He, along with the rest of the City, will watch Hayes's appearance closely, as the case appears slightly trickier to predict than the rigged rates: Hayes has yet to enter a plea.",

      "body": "<p>There was a time when Ian Hannam was considered something of a City celebrity as the most sucked up to corporate financier in the Square Mile.</p> <p>\"Perhaps the City's top dealmaker,\" gushed the London <em>Evening Standard</em>; \"One of the City of London's most prolific merger advisers,\" purred the <em>Sunday Telegraph</em>, and if you suspected that period was the top of the market for Hannam's reputation, you were spot on.</p> <p>With hindsight, the heroic deals now seem to range from the disastrous (Bumi, Kazakhmys) to the painful (Genel), as well as the controversial (Glencore Xstrata) to the very decent (BHP Billiton). This week Hannam will fight to restore another thread of his image when he appeals against last year's \u00a3450,000 Financial Services Authority fine for market abuse, with the start of a financial services and markets tribunal hearing.</p> <p>The FSA found that Hannam sent two emails disclosing inside information about his client, Heritage Oil, but the banker will argue his words were too vague to be considered significant. If that battle plan fails, the former Territorial Army captain might send for reinforcements, with his troops whispering that Tony Buckingham, the notoriously shy former mercenary and Heritage Oil boss, could be drafted in.</p> <p>Developing, as they say.</p> <h2>Rising interest for payday lenders</h2> <p>Interest in payday lenders is rising faster than repayments on one of their overdue loans.</p> <p>After the Office of Fair Trading asked for a review into the sector last week, following its discovery of deep-rooted problems in the way vulnerable customers are treated, representatives from the \u00a32bn-a-year industry will tomorrow potter along to Whitehall, where they have been summoned for a meeting with the government's consumer minister Jo Swinson \u2013 plus financial regulators and debt charities \u2013 to discuss whether more regulation is needed to protect borrowers.</p> <p>Figures from the debt charity StepChange show that between 2011 and 2012 the average payday-loan debt of its London-based clients rose by \u00a3563 to \u00a31,859, as annual interest rates on some loans top 5,000%.</p> <p>That is just the sort of inconvenient statistic that makes this topic so tricky for lenders to spin, although inevitably there is a trade association on hand to have a go.</p> <p>Russell Hamblin-Boone, head of the Consumer Finance Association (CFA), says: \"We look forward to the opportunity to engage in open and honest dialogue with the government, regulators, consumer groups and debt charities\" \u2013 so we can assume payday lenders are backing reform 5,235%.</p> <h2>Libor teaser<br></h2> <p>We've known for a while that Libor isn't working, and we'll get another look at just how badly things went wrong on Thursday when Southwark crown court hosts Tom Hayes.</p> <p>He's the 33-year-old former trader at investment banks Citigroup and UBS, whose sole claim to fame is that he's the only banker yet to have been charged by the Serious Fraud Office with rigging Libor, following allegations that he conspired with Royal Bank of Scotland, JP Morgan Chase, Deutsche Bank, Rabobank, RP Martin, HSBC, Icap and Tullett Prebon to manipulate the world's interest rate benchmark.</p> <p>All of the firms named either decline to comment or reiterate that they're assisting authorities with their inquiries, but the intriguing name on the list is Tullett as (a) it maintains it has no evidence suggesting its brokers acted improperly or are under investigation, and (b) the firm's chief executive, Terry Smith, has been an outspoken advocate of prosecuting anyone caught fiddling the rate.
