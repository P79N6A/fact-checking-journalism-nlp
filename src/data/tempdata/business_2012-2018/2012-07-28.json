    "sectionName": "Business", 
    "webTitle": "A weak euro is good for the holidays \u2013 and even for Europe itself", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A few years ago, on the eve of the Keegan family's holiday in France, a friend from the Treasury teased me by saying: \"Enjoy the exchange rate you have so long advocated.\" This was at a time when the pound/euro rate, having been close to \u20ac1.50 in the middle of the decade, was by the summer of 2009 approaching parity \u2013 ie, only one euro to the pound. At almost \u20ac1.30 now, the pound is in far better shape for British holidaymakers going abroad, although that makes it a worry for economists concerned about Britain's longer-term trading position. Paradoxically, however, as the US economist Martin Feldstein recently suggested in the Financial Times, the weakness of the euro, while reflecting the loss of faith of the financial markets in the sustainability of the euro area, may simultaneously offer a lifeline to the single currency. For it is by now, one trusts, widely recognised that the economies under pressure \u2013 Greece, Spain, even Italy \u2013 have suffered a huge loss of competitiveness vis-a-vis Germany, and have, of course, been unable to devalue against a no-longer-existent deutschmark. As Feldstein implies, though, the loss of confidence in the euro, and its accompanying decline, bring one consolation to the entire eurozone. Germany becomes even more \"super-competitive\" with that decline, and benefits most; but the rest become more competitive vis-\u00e0-vis non-eurozone countries. Professor Feldstein has always been sceptical about the wisdom of the eurozone. As the economist who predicted in 1997 that struggles between countries over secession from an economically costly union would bring Europe to civil war, he is a man who writes with feeling. Many of us were equally sceptical. Indeed, those of us who were against the idea of Britain joining, but basically in favour of European Union and our continuing membership of it, often had a tricky time: friends who did not grasp the economics of it all thought we were being 'un-European'. And rightwing, and for that matter leftwing, eurosceptics \u2013 or euro-septics, as Ted Heath used to call them \u2013 tried to welcome us as one of their band. Just as it was difficult to find anyone after Black Wednesday who did not agree that Britain's membership of the exchange rate mechanism (ERM) had been a mistake, so, now, there are not many people who claim that we should have joined the eurozone. In a spirit of summer holiday goodwill, we can pass over the fact that almost the entire establishment was in favour of joining the ERM and, later, the euro at the time. My favourite rationalisation comes from a distinguished economist who says: \"It was right at the time to be wrong.\" Professor Feldstein's worry is that although, like myself, he believes the eurozone was a mistake, \"allowing it to dissolve now would be very costly to governments, investors and citizens\". The $64,000 question (I hesitate to say \u20ac64,000) is whether in economic and social terms it would be less costly to break the eurozone up. There are other scenarios: a split-level euro; a smaller eurozone of core countries, known to older readers as \"the D-mark bloc\"; and a not-so-small eurozone, minus \u2013 well, again in holiday spirit, we shall not mention names. The eurozone as a whole is stronger than it looks. But it does not operate as a whole; European economic policy, taken in the round, is far too deflationary; and the financial markets seem determined to pick off the peripheral economies one by one, before \u2013 who knows? \u2013 then moving on to the stronger economies weakened by underwriting attempts at \"rescue\" of their weaker brethren. These are deep waters, and the outcome is anybody's guess. But if the downward trend of the euro continues, the Feldstein view, if correct, may at least alleviate things. One worry about the Feldstein solution is that it raises the spectre of the kind of competitive devaluation that led to protectionism in the 1930s. With a manifest deficiency of aggregate demand, too many countries are relying on currency depreciation. Which brings us back to the UK and the pound. The British economy was recovering in the second half of 2009 and first half of 2010, but went back into recession when George Osborne unveiled his austerity programme and raised VAT at a crucially bad time for confidence. This government has proved extraordinarily successful at lowering the Keynesian \"animal spirits\" of Britain's entrepreneurs. Apologists for recent policies maintain that the latest GDP figures are not consistent with other economic indicators. But even if the apparent fall in second-quarter GDP is a statistical error, the overall picture is at best flat \u2013 and consistent with the view that the economy is still in depression and showing few signs of recovery. Until now, the Treasury and the Bank of England have been tacitly relying on the competitive boost given to the economy by the massive sterling devaluation of 2007-09, which was more than 25% at one stage. The stronger pound that is now welcomed by holidaymakers is not such good news for British exporters. But for a few weeks this summer those of us who go abroad will benefit financially from the fact that the euro has been declining with the approval of Professor Feldstein.",

Germany becomes even more \"super-competitive\" with that decline, and benefits most; but the rest become more competitive vis-\u00e0-vis non-eurozone countries.</p> <p>Professor Feldstein has always been sceptical about the wisdom of the eurozone. As the economist who predicted in 1997 that struggles between countries over secession from an economically costly union would bring Europe to civil war, he is a man who writes with feeling.</p> <p>Many of us were equally sceptical. Indeed, those of us who were against the idea of Britain joining, but basically in favour of European Union and our continuing membership of it, often had a tricky time: friends who did not grasp the economics of it all thought we were being 'un-European'. And rightwing, and for that matter leftwing, eurosceptics \u2013 or euro-<em>septics</em>, as Ted Heath used to call them \u2013 tried to welcome us as one of their band.</p> <p>Just as it was difficult to find anyone after Black Wednesday who did not agree that Britain's membership of the exchange rate mechanism (ERM) had been a mistake, so, now, there are not many people who claim that we should have joined the eurozone.</p> <p>In a spirit of summer holiday goodwill, we can pass over the fact that almost the entire establishment was in favour of joining the ERM and, later, the euro at the time. My favourite rationalisation comes from a distinguished economist who says: \"It was right at the time to be wrong.\"</p> <p>Professor Feldstein's worry is that although, like myself, he believes the eurozone was a mistake, \"allowing it to dissolve now would be very costly to governments, investors and citizens\".</p> <p>The $64,000 question (I hesitate to say \u20ac64,000) is whether in economic and social terms it would be less costly to break the eurozone up. There are other scenarios: a split-level euro; a smaller eurozone of core countries, known to older readers as \"the D-mark bloc\"; and a not-so-small eurozone, minus \u2013 well, again in holiday spirit, we shall not mention&#xa0;names.</p> <p>The eurozone as a whole is stronger than it looks. But it does not operate as a whole; European economic policy, taken in the round, is far too deflationary; and the financial markets seem determined to pick off the peripheral economies one by one, before \u2013 who knows? \u2013 then moving on to the stronger economies weakened by underwriting attempts at \"rescue\" of their weaker brethren.</p> <p>These are deep waters, and the outcome is anybody's guess. But if the downward trend of the euro continues, the Feldstein view, if correct, may at least alleviate things.</p> <p>One worry about the Feldstein solution is that it raises the spectre of the kind of competitive devaluation that led to protectionism in the 1930s. With a manifest deficiency of aggregate demand, too many countries are relying on currency depreciation.</p> <p>Which brings us back to the UK and the pound. The British economy was recovering in the second half of 2009 and first half of 2010, but went back into recession when George Osborne unveiled his austerity programme and raised VAT at a crucially bad time for confidence. This government has proved extraordinarily successful at lowering the Keynesian \"animal spirits\" of Britain's entrepreneurs.</p> <p>Apologists for recent policies maintain that the latest GDP figures are not consistent with other economic indicators. But even if the apparent fall in second-quarter GDP is a statistical error, the overall picture is at best flat \u2013 and consistent with the view that the economy is still in depression and showing few signs of&#xa0;recovery.</p> <p>Until now, the Treasury and the Bank of England have been tacitly relying on the competitive boost given to the economy by the massive sterling devaluation of 2007-09, which was more than 25% at one&#xa0;stage.</p> <p>The stronger pound that is now welcomed by holidaymakers is not such good news for British exporters. But for a few weeks this summer those of us who go abroad will benefit financially from the fact that the euro has been declining with the approval of Professor Feldstein.</p>",

      "bodyText": "China blew previous Olympic hosts out of the water by pumping \u00a320bn into the Beijing Games, which memorably closed with the spectacle of fireworks exploding in the shape of the interlocking rings. The monster budget was a not-very-subtle display of China's financial firepower. The striking bird's nest stadium, with its ribbons of steel, was a symbol of the huge country's economic prowess. And though the Olympic cauldron may now be burning in east London, Beijing is still flexing its financial muscles. On Friday senior UK government ministers courted Chinese industrialists at a summit in the capital as the coalition desperately tries to pull in overseas investors to Britain. China is already the second-largest overseas investor in London, and the third biggest in the UK as a whole. It has the outspoken backing of the UK government: on a trip to the world's second-largest economy in January, George Osborne encouraged investors there to put money into British transport, energy and utility projects. Three days later, China Investment Corporation (CIC), the country's sovereign wealth fund, bought a 9% stake in Thames Water. And a few days ago, Wales &amp; West Utilities, the company that operates Wales's gas infrastructure, was sold to a Chinese consortium in a \u00a3645m deal. Chinese oil enterprises have also just bought two North Sea oil fields in one day, albeit from Canadian companies: China's top refiner, Sinopec, acquired a $1.5bn stake in the North Sea operations of Talisman, while the China National Offshore Oil Corporation splashed out $15bn on Nexen. The deep-pocketed Chinese are now the power behind the throne of British companies ranging from Thames Water and Scotland's biggest mainland oil refinery, Grangemouth, to Weetabix, bespoke suitmaker Gieves &amp; Hawkes, Harvey Nichols and Pringle. The UK drew the line when the privately-owned telecoms group Huawei offered to pay for mobile phone coverage on the underground as a gift between Olympic nations, but it is already BT's strategic partner in developing the national broadband network in Britain and on Friday promised to create 200 new UK jobs. Its chairman, Sun Yafang, praised the UK's \"free and open market\" and \"efficient, supportive and transparent government\". All that cash comes from one pool of money: China's massive stockpile of foreign exchange reserves, worth about \u00a32tn at present, says Aman Wang, the London-based head of KPMG's global China practice. Most of the funds flow to CIC and the state administration of foreign exchange, an arm of China's central bank. The UK continues to attract more foreign investment than any other European country, creating more than 112,000 jobs in the last year, a near 20% increase on the previous year, business secretary Vince Cable announced last week. So what gives Britain the edge? Wang cites the flexible labour market vis-a-vis countries like Germany and France, a wealth of senior managerial staff and financial talent, a benign tax regime and high-end manufacturing expertise in areas such as aviation. \"Politically it's a relatively open environment for foreign investors,\" he adds. \"The UK government has done a reasonably good job promoting the infrastructure sector at national level, and at state level Scotland and Wales have been promoting themselves.\" Just last week, it emerged that China also harbours ambitions to become a major player in the UK energy industry by building a series of new nuclear power stations. Two Beijing-backed energy groups are in separate talks to buy the Horizon consortium, which plans to build two UK reactors, from its German owners E.ON and RWE. China's companies are pushing forward globally: Chinese investment abroad has swelled from an annual average of below $3bn before 2005 to more than $60bn in 2010 and 2011, according to a recent report by consultancy Rhodium Group, which specialises in China. Garry Pass, managing director of NVC UK, a wholly owned subsidiary of China's largest lighting company, says: \"We welcome people here a lot more than other European countries.\" The company is supplying lighting to the 2012 Olympics, having started from a London office in 2009 with a sales force of 10 and two designers. Sales were \u00a36,000 then. That figure ballooned to \u00a32m by May 2012. And now the firm is plotting its expansion into mainland Europe, using Britain as a base \u2013 a common strategy. \u2022 This article was amended on 30 July 2012. The original referred to Huawei as state-owned. This has been corrected.",
