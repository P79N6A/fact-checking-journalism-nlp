      "bodyText": "More than 40% of Britain\u2019s recession-scarred workers expect to receive a pay freeze or a cut to their wages this year despite George Osborne\u2019s claim to have restored living standards, ensuring they would \u201cgrow strongly every year for the rest of the decade\u201d. Just one in five of these workers expect their pay to rise by 2% or more in 2015, according to a new survey by information provider Markit, raising doubts about whether economic recovery can be sustained. More than a third of the 973 households surveyed earlier this month expected a pay freeze this year, while 7.5% are braced for a cut. Expectations of flat or falling wages were most pronounced in the public sector where 45% of workers saw these outcomes as most likely. That compared to 40% in the private sector. Average pay-rise expectations were progressively weaker moving down the pay scale from high-earners to low-earners, the survey showed, though it had been carried out shortly before the prime minister announced the minimum wage would rise by 20p, to \u00a36.40, from October. George Osborne has insisted that strong pay growth and zero inflation mean living standards are rising as voters prepare to give their verdict on the government\u2019s \u201ceconomic plan\u201d in May\u2019s general election. But Markit\u2019s chief economist, Chris Williamson, said the responses suggested average pay growth was likely to be little more than 1% this year \u2014 well below the 3.5% forecast by the Bank of England, which its governor Mark Carney has said will deliver the strongest rise in real take-home pay for a decade. \u201cLike many others, the Bank of England is expecting a revival of pay growth to help support ongoing robust economic growth this year. This data suggest policymakers are likely to be disappointed,\u201d Williamson said. He added that weaker pay growth could mean the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee will leave interest rates at their record low of 0.5% for at least the rest of this year. Household spending has been key to supporting the recovery in economic growth over the past 12 months, but it has been partly driven by consumers dipping into their savings. Without a stronger rise in wages than the 1.6% growth rate registered in the latest official figures, consumer demand growth could peter out. One member, Bank chief economist Andy Haldane, recently cited weak wage growth as a key reason the next move in interest rates may actually have to be down, instead of up, but others, including Carney, have insisted borrowing costs are heading up. Markit suggested the only sign of wage inflation is in new hires, where firms are sometimes having to pay more to win the right candidate. But the vast majority of employees, who have not changed job, appear to be struggling to negotiate a rise, particularly with inflation at the lowest level on record. \u201cLike many others, the Bank of England is expecting a revival of pay growth to help support ongoing robust economic growth this year,\u201d said Williamson. \u201cThese data suggest policymakers are likely to be disappointed, meaning economic growth is likely to fall short of the 2.9% ... currently being forecast by the Bank for 2015.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "A Jersey company controlled by Sir Philip Green\u2019s family received \u00a370m from the sale of 12 properties to the new owners of BHS as part of a deal to offload the loss-making high street chain. Details of the sale provide a further glimpse of the scale of the Green family\u2019s payout from this month\u2019s \u00a31 sale of BHS to Retail Acquisitions, a group of little-known investors led by former bankrupt and racing driver Dominic Chappell. The Green family bought the BHS properties for \u00a3106m in 2001 and so the sale of the properties to Retail Acquisitions, marks a near \u00a340m paper loss for them. It is also unclear how much of the proceeds from the sale were required to pay down debt as Carmen Properties, the property-holding vehicle for the BHS stores owned by the Greens, is based in the offshore tax haven of Jersey. Until recently, the Greens enjoyed an annual rental income from BHS of about \u00a311m a year even as it slipped into heavy losses. Last year the rent was \u00a310.4m. Green said the deal was a good one for Retail Acquisitions as it would significantly cut the retailer\u2019s annual rental bill. \u201cThe properties were offered back to the company at a price of \u00a370m, which effectively enabled the company to save \u00a39m a year in rent. I think it is a good opportunity for them to start to cut into the losses at the business,\u201d Green told the Guardian. The entrepreneur\u2019s family has also agreed to pay \u00a315m into BHS\u2019s pension fund over the next three years to help repair the funding shortfall. Together Retail Acquisitions and the Greens will pay in \u00a310m this year. The fund has a deficit of more than \u00a3100m. The Green family is paying back into the business after BHS shareholders, led by Green\u2019s wife Tina, who lives in Monaco, extracted more than \u00a3400m in dividends since buying the retailer 15 years ago. The family also controls the Arcadia group, which owns Topshop, Miss Selfridge and Dorothy Perkins. On the eve of this month\u2019s sale of BHS, the company sold North West House \u2013 the building that houses part of BHS\u2019s headquarters in Marylebone, London \u2013 to Alexander Dellal, brother of the model Alice and grandson of legendary property investor \u201cBlack Jack\u201d Dellal. Dellal junior is also thought to be considering buying the main BHS headquarters, Marylebone House, on Marylebone Road in a deal under which the retailer would lease back it back for two years rent-free, according to the Sunday Times. Property sources suggested Marylebone House, which remains privately owned by the Green family, could be worth about \u00a340m. Meanwhile Retail Acquisitions is considering whether to sell parts of BHS\u2019s mixed bag of property assets. It has signed up agents to review the future of nearly a third of the chain\u2019s 171 stores, many of which are much in need of modernisation. About 50 stores, including outlets in Bristol, Birmingham and Cardiff, are being considered for potential sale, closure or lease renegotiation. Letting out surplus space to other companies is also under consideration. The buyout group is also in negotiations with BHS\u2019s pension fund trustees regarding a funding deficit of at least \u00a3100m. The fund\u2019s triennial valuation, which was set to begin at the end of this month, is thought likely to value the deficit at a significantly higher level. A letter sent to pension members by trustees in the wake of the sale of the business put the scheme\u2019s \u201cbuyout valuation\u201d at \u00a3450m, according to a report in the Daily Mail. However, this theoretical figure is much higher than the value of the deficit likely to be recorded on BHS\u2019s books. \u2022 This article was amended on 2 April 2015. An earlier version said the Green family and Retail Acquisitions shared proceeds of the \u00a330-\u00a340m sale of North West House. That was based on information from Retail Acquisitions, but in fact the entire proceeds of the sale of the building were left within BHS. Also, the subheading was amended to emphasise the point that the sale of 12 properties for \u00a370m marked a \u00a340m paper loss for the Green family. Finally, Sir Philip Green has asked us to reiterate the point that the deal resulted in a \u00a39m annual rent reduction for BHS, as well as the \u00a340m loss.",

It is also unclear how much of the proceeds from the sale were required to pay down debt as Carmen Properties, the property-holding vehicle for the BHS stores owned by the Greens, is based in the offshore tax haven of Jersey.</p> <p>Until recently, the Greens enjoyed an annual rental income from BHS of about \u00a311m a year even as it slipped into heavy losses. Last year the rent was \u00a310.4m.</p> <p>Green said the deal was a good one for Retail Acquisitions as it would significantly cut the retailer\u2019s annual rental bill. \u201cThe properties were offered back to the company at a price of \u00a370m, which effectively enabled the company to save \u00a39m a year in rent. I think it is a good opportunity for them to start to cut into the losses at the business,\u201d Green told the Guardian.</p> <p>The entrepreneur\u2019s family has also agreed to pay \u00a315m into BHS\u2019s pension fund over the next three years to help repair the funding shortfall. Together Retail Acquisitions and the Greens will pay in \u00a310m this year. The fund has a deficit of more than \u00a3100m.<br></p> <p>The Green family is paying back into the business after BHS shareholders, led by Green\u2019s wife Tina, who lives in Monaco, extracted more than \u00a3400m in dividends since buying the retailer 15 years ago. The family also controls the Arcadia group, which owns Topshop, Miss Selfridge and Dorothy Perkins.<br></p> <p>On the eve of this month\u2019s sale of BHS, the company sold North West House \u2013 the building that houses part of BHS\u2019s headquarters in Marylebone, London \u2013 to Alexander Dellal, brother of the model Alice and grandson of legendary property investor <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/nov/08/jack-dellal\">\u201cBlack Jack\u201d Dellal</a>.</p> <p>Dellal junior is also thought to be considering buying the main BHS headquarters, Marylebone House, on Marylebone Road in a deal under which the retailer would lease back it back for two years rent-free, according to the Sunday Times. Property sources suggested Marylebone House, which remains privately owned by the Green family, could be worth about \u00a340m.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/mar/17/bhs-owners-consider-sale-closure-50-stores\">New BHS owners consider sale or closure of 50 stores</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Meanwhile Retail Acquisitions is considering whether to sell parts of BHS\u2019s mixed bag of property assets. It has signed up agents to review the future of nearly a third of the chain\u2019s 171 stores, many of which are much in need of modernisation. About 50 stores, including outlets in Bristol, Birmingham and Cardiff, are being considered for potential sale, closure or lease renegotiation. Letting out surplus space to other companies is also under consideration. </p> <p>The buyout group is also in negotiations with BHS\u2019s pension fund trustees regarding a funding deficit of at least \u00a3100m. The fund\u2019s triennial valuation, which was set to begin at the end of this month, is thought likely to value the deficit at a significantly higher level. A letter sent to pension members by trustees in the wake of the sale of the business put the scheme\u2019s \u201cbuyout valuation\u201d at \u00a3450m, according to a report in the Daily Mail. However, this theoretical figure is much higher than the value of the deficit likely to be recorded on BHS\u2019s books.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 2 April 2015. An earlier version said the Green family and Retail Acquisitions shared proceeds of the \u00a330-\u00a340m sale of North West House. That was based on information from Retail Acquisitions, but in fact the entire proceeds of the sale of the building were left within BHS. Also, the subheading was amended to emphasise the point that the sale of 12 properties for \u00a370m marked a \u00a340m paper loss for the Green family. Finally, Sir Philip Green has asked us to reiterate the point that the deal resulted in a \u00a39m annual rent reduction for BHS, as well as the \u00a340m loss.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Earlier this year Shinzo Abe, Japan\u2019s prime minister, told his country\u2019s business elite that he wanted them to take a brave decision. He wanted them to raise wages. A month or so later David Cameron followed suit. Addressing the chambers of commerce, the prime minister said it was time for Britain to have a pay rise. Two prime ministers, same message, one subtle difference: in Japan there is evidence that executives took notice of what Abe said, while in the UK we are still waiting for the long-anticipated pick up in pay. There are virtues to Japan\u2019s corporatist model. When Abe spoke, it mattered. When Cameron spoke, it didn\u2019t. Let\u2019s be clear. We are talking about different countries here. Britain ditched its corporatist model long ago and replaced it with a flexible labour market. What\u2019s more, deflation has been a feature of the Japanese economy for the past quarter of a century; Britain has yet to experience a single month when annual inflation as measured by the consumer prices index has been falling. Even so, Japan\u2019s recent experience is relevant. It shows the dangers of allowing deflation to become embedded and that radical measures are eventually required to cure the problem. In the UK, it is assumed that the fall in inflation to zero is a temporary phenomenon. Almost all of the nine members of the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee think that the next move in interest rates will be up. But the warning signs are there. One straw in the wind is what is happening to prices in the shops. Retail sales were strong in February, up 5.7% on the same month in 2014. But shops and stores had to slash prices in order to persuade consumers to part with their money. Prices were 3.6% lower than a year earlier, the biggest year on year decline since modern records began in 1997. Of even more significance is what has been happening to wages. Here, the \u201cdeflation-is-not-a-threat\u201d school argue that falling unemployment will translate into higher pay settlements. Confronted with official data that shows this is simply not happening, the response (as it has been for the past two years) is: give it time. Andy Haldane, the Bank of England\u2019s chief economist, noted in a recent speech that since 2011, unemployment had consistently undershot the Bank\u2019s forecasts. Threadneedle Street has also got it spectacularly wrong with regard to wages. Given the shorter dole queues, the Bank expected wage settlements to become more generous. According to the Bank\u2019s models, earnings should be rising by more than 4% a year by now. In reality, they are struggling to get above 2%. That is not simply because productivity is weak, although that is part of the story. So what\u2019s the explanation? It could be that the lags between falling unemployment and rising wages are longer than they were in the past. But there might be more to it than that. The relationship between unemployment and wage pressures appears to have changed, so that a much bigger drop in joblessness is needed to provide upward pressure on earnings. Haldane says this might arise because the pool of workers willing to work at existing wage rates has increased, for example because of older workers taking up jobs or workers moving to the UK from overseas. \u201cThere is evidence of many of these trends intensifying over the past few years\u201d, he said in his speech. \u201cFor example, the unemployment rate among 18 to 24-year-olds has fallen by almost 4 percentage points over the past year. The trend in labour force participation has picked up significantly among women and older cohorts over the same period. And net migration to the UK was estimated to be almost 300,000 in the year to September, almost double the level two years earlier.\u201d There was a time, as the LSE economist Alan Manning notes in his contribution to a collection of essays published by the Resolution Foundation when year after year of falling real wages would not have been tolerated. \u201cForty years ago an improving labour market and prices rising faster than wages would have led trade unions to march into the boardroom demanding higher wages and threatening strike action if those demands were not met. Pretty soon, union leaders would have been invited round to No 10 for beer and sandwiches to be cajoled into wage moderation to prevent and inflationary spiral taking hold. A lot has changed in the past 40 years.\u201d Too right it has. Employers now call the shots not unions. \u201cOnce workers would have been looking for the first opportunity to press for higher wages; now employers are looking at pay rises as a last resort,\u201d Manning says. Falling inflation now provides employers with a pretext for keeping wage settlements low. And if lower wage settlements start to embed the idea that disinflationary pressures are stronger or longer lasting than previously imagined, that\u2019s the start of a deflationary spiral right there. Haldane notes that the evidence from the Bank of England\u2019s agents, who pick up information from businesses across the UK, is that \u201ccontacts cite falling inflation expectations as the most important factor currently holding back wage settlements.\u201d The weakness of earnings growth is not new. As Manning notes, there has been a ratcheting down of wage growth since the 1980s. The ecology of the labour market has changed; the balance of power between workers and employers has shifted decisively in favour of the latter, and this is reflected in strong profits and weak wage growth. This creates its own problems, because workers struggle to buy the goods and services they are producing. It is for this reason that central banks have run highly stimulative policies for the past six years. If they want to get wages up they may need to continue doing so. Why? Because those who argue that wages will eventually rise if unemployment falls far enough are right. They will, but only if competition for labour among employers is so strong that they have no alternative but to offer more money. That is what happened in the US during the late 1990s, the one period recently when the demand for labour more than compensated for the almost complete absence of collective bargaining. But be clear. The amount of stimulus required has increased over time. And there are side-effects of the ultra-low interest rates necessary to boost labour demand: asset-price bubbles and excessive personal debt to name but two. There is an alternative. Governments could order bigger increases in minimum wages; they could insist that those companies bidding for state contracts pay a living wage; they could make it easier for trade unions to organise and bargain collectively. Like Abe in Japan, they could tilt the playing field back in favour of labour.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "This is no ordinary furniture showroom. In a field on the side of a hill 15 miles north of Derby lie row after row of perfectly maintained willow, oak, ash and sycamore trees. What clearly mark this field out from a regular forest are the blue-and-black plastic moulds that are training the trees in pre-defined routes, where they are gently and expertly manipulated into the exact shape of a chair, a table, a lamp or a mirror frame. This one-hectare (2.5 acre) field in Wirksworth is home to Full Grown, a company that later this year will harvest pieces of furniture, each made from one solid piece of wood \u2013 with no joins \u2013 following a project that was launched almost 10 years ago by its founder, Gavin Munro, now aged 39. Each of the pieces have grown from one tree, planted specifically for that reason, its limbs guided in an exact shape and later grafted together to produce the unique pieces of furniture, which he hopes are the pioneers of a new method of sustainable, efficient and ecologically aware production. \u201cWhen you look at it from a manufacturing point of view and from a design point of view, it actually makes total sense. Why would you grow trees, chop them down with all the faff? Why don\u2019t you just grow the shape you want and it is eminently scalable? You can make thousands of these in the same way as you can make 10, but each one is unique,\u201d said Munro. The idea for the method came when he was working as a gardener in California and making furniture from washed-up driftwood on the side. He recalled how a bonsai tree his mother had when he was a child outgrew itself to resemble a throne. \u201cWhy do we need to bring all of these things together \u2013 chop the trees down, make them small, stick them back together again. We can just start from growing the tree from the beginning.\u201d Some of Munro\u2019s initial attempts at what has been termed \u201cbotanical manufacturing\u201d were scuttled by a herd of cows who walked over a very young forest. A prototype chair was eventually developed using four trees, which each grew from a leg into a stable single piece of wood. What has emerged from those early speculative days is a diligently ordered forest with 400 pieces of furniture growing, sectioned out by wood and type \u2013 be it chairs, tables, mirrors or lamps. The process starts by shaping the young tress around the moulds by bending the growing tips in the direction they need to go with small plastic clasps. When the different strands of the tree need to be brought together to form one solid piece of wood, parts of the bark are shaved off and they are aligned, eventually growing together again. Once the final shape has been formed, the trees are left to mature and thicken, leaving a solid piece of wood without any joins. The method is described as being more about persuasion than manipulation. \u201cThe trees are growing and all we are doing is shaping the tips as it grows along,\u201d said Munro. \u201cThe trick is to let the tree grow and just tweak it as you go along. That is the beauty of it. It is so simple.\u201d The first harvest is expected to come in October when trees which will have been growing as chairs for four years will be carefully cut before being dried out and treated to become the final product. The first ones are expected to be exhibited next year and those which have been preordered will be delivered in 2017. \u201cWe thought we would have harvest by now. But trees, well \u2026 they grow slow,\u201d said Munro. With the 400 pieces of furniture growing, there are about 4,000 shoots that need to be managed and guided. This leaves a huge logistical operation for Munro and his team in a sometimes frustrating process that he dubs \u201cmass production meets delayed gratification\u201d. \u201cIf you look at it like wine growing \u2013 you start a vineyard, it is going to be six years before anything comes off it, and then you have got a harvest every year. So by the time our first harvest comes around we will have something every year thereafter,\u201d he said. \u201cBy the time you have got a piece, you are sitting on four years of somebody\u2019s time. You are sitting on four years of growth.\u201d As they will be formed of one solid piece of wood with no joins, the furniture will be stronger, said Munro. The roots that are currently growing the first batches will then be reused repeatedly with stronger and faster subsequent pieces expected, he said. For typical mass furniture production, trees can be grown for 60 years before they are felled, cut up, reassembled and shipped to their final destination, he said. Munro argues their method is substantially more friendly to the environment and wants to open up his ideas to others to develop a new method of mass production. \u201cTo grow that chair, you don\u2019t need the truck to pull it out, the chainsaw to cut it down, you don\u2019t need the factory with the machines in it. You don\u2019t need to build the roads into the forest. You don\u2019t need all that stuff,\u201d he said. In an attempt to cut the amount of time needed to produce pieces, the company started growing mirror frames that come up in two years, some of which are also expected to be harvested later this year. Once the firm has become financially stable, Munro intends to spread the operation and may consider growing unique products like glasses frames and headphone covers. The tight community around Fully Grown has rallied around in support of the unique venture, said Munro. \u201cAt the beginning when I said this is what I want to do, that is when people were laughing, but now that we have got a factory and it is working that laugh has turned into \u2018Oh really?\u2019.\u201d Growth forecast - the price of furniture The first solid chairs will be sold for \u00a32,500, while lamps will be between \u00a31,000 and \u00a31,500 \u2013 targeted at people who are looking for a unique art piece and \u201cbelieve in the mission\u201d, said Munro.

      "body": "<p>This is no ordinary furniture showroom. In a field on the side of a hill 15 miles north of Derby lie row after row of perfectly maintained willow, oak, ash and sycamore trees. What clearly mark this field out from a regular forest are the blue-and-black plastic moulds that are training the trees in pre-defined routes, where they are gently and expertly manipulated into the exact shape of a chair, a table, a lamp or a mirror frame.<br></p> <p>This one-hectare (2.5 acre) field in Wirksworth is home to <a href=\"http://fullgrown.co.uk/\">Full Grown</a>, a company that later this year will harvest pieces of furniture, each made from one solid piece of wood \u2013 with no joins \u2013 following a project that was launched almost 10 years ago by its founder, Gavin Munro, now aged 39.<br></p> <p>Each of the pieces have grown from one tree, planted specifically for that reason, its limbs guided in an exact shape and later grafted together to produce the unique pieces of furniture, which he hopes are the pioneers of a new method of sustainable, efficient and ecologically aware production.<br></p> <p>\u201cWhen you look at it from a manufacturing point of view and from a design point of view, it actually makes total sense. Why would you grow trees, chop them down with all the faff? Why don\u2019t you just grow the shape you want and it is eminently scalable? You can make thousands of these in the same way as you can make 10, but each one is unique,\u201d said Munro.<br></p> <p>The idea for the method came when he was working as a gardener in California and making furniture from washed-up driftwood on the side. He recalled how a bonsai tree his mother had when he was a child outgrew itself to resemble a throne. \u201cWhy do we need to bring all of these things together \u2013 chop the trees down, make them small, stick them back together again. We can just start from growing the tree from the beginning.\u201d<br></p> <p>Some of Munro\u2019s initial attempts at what has been termed \u201cbotanical manufacturing\u201d were scuttled by a herd of cows who walked over a very young forest. A prototype chair was eventually developed using four trees, which each grew from a leg into a stable single piece of wood.<br></p> <p>What has emerged from those early speculative days is a diligently ordered forest with 400 pieces of furniture growing, sectioned out by wood and type \u2013 be it chairs, tables, mirrors or lamps.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ca323ff22b726142c6534af5a56ad458c19cec9b\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/3/29/1427628380794/1be41a9e-3cc5-4ae4-8974-f7d3b52afb1d-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Moulds train trees to grow into hall mirrors at Full Grown in Derbyshire.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Moulds train trees to grow into hall mirrors at Full Grown in Derbyshire.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fabio De Paola</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The process starts by shaping the young tress around the moulds by bending the growing tips in the direction they need to go with small plastic clasps. When the different strands of the tree need to be brought together to form one solid piece of wood, parts of the bark are shaved off and they are aligned, eventually growing together again. Once the final shape has been formed, the trees are left to mature and thicken, leaving a solid piece of wood without any joins. The method is described as being more about persuasion than manipulation.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cThe trees are growing and all we are doing is shaping the tips as it grows along,\u201d said Munro. \u201cThe trick is to let the tree grow and just tweak it as you go along. That is the beauty of it. It is so simple.\u201d<br></p> <p>The first harvest is expected to come in October when trees which will have been growing as chairs for four years will be carefully cut before being dried out and treated to become the final product. The first ones are expected to be exhibited next year and those which have been preordered will be delivered in 2017. \u201cWe thought we would have harvest by now. But trees, well \u2026 they grow slow,\u201d said Munro.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>With the 400 pieces of furniture growing, there are about 4,000 shoots that need to be managed and guided. This leaves a huge logistical operation for Munro and his team in a sometimes frustrating process that he dubs \u201cmass production meets delayed gratification\u201d.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cIf you look at it like wine growing \u2013 you start a vineyard, it is going to be six years before anything comes off it, and then you have got a harvest every year. So by the time our first harvest comes around we will have something every year thereafter,\u201d he said. \u201cBy the time you have got a piece, you are sitting on four years of somebody\u2019s time. You are sitting on four years of growth.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"33f40deb1fba201c199d0ab003a11524748746ed\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/3/29/1427628778951/626fa449-4194-48f9-a9a1-64fecae79a9b-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"A tree growing through one of Full Grown's mould frames.

The roots that are currently growing the first batches will then be reused repeatedly with stronger and faster subsequent pieces expected, he said.<br></p> <p>For typical mass furniture production, trees can be grown for 60 years before they are felled, cut up, reassembled and shipped to their final destination, he said. Munro argues their method is substantially more friendly to the environment and wants to open up his ideas to others to develop a new method of mass production.<br></p> <p>\u201cTo grow that chair, you don\u2019t need the truck to pull it out, the chainsaw to cut it down, you don\u2019t need the factory with the machines in it.

Wobbles at Kingfisher This page has long campaigned for Kingfisher, the owner of DIY retailer B&amp;Q, to be recognised for its achievement of inflicting more misery on its customers than almost any other company in the UK (and this is a crowded field). What other business allows its clients to set out with lofty intentions of sacrificing a bank holiday in order to improve their family\u2019s surroundings, only to be routinely left either (a) humiliated by their efforts, (b) on the end of a rollicking from their spouse or, (c) in casualty? So we can be forgiven a certain amount of schadenfreude when something constructed by Kingfisher looks like falling down, as its \u20ac275m acquisition of French DIY chain Mr Bricolage threatened to do last week. The deal is now wobbling like a cheap shelving unit after the Bricolage board and its biggest shareholder voiced reservations about the proposed deal. All of which is bound to attract some comment this week when Kingfisher\u2019s newish chief executive, V\u00e9ronique Laury, sets out her strategy and reveals how the group has assembled its full-year results. Meanwhile, Kingfisher concedes that it\u2019s considering all of its options on Bricolage \u2013 or, in other words, wondering how it might paper over a few cracks. Asos doing it by the numbers One of the oft-stated criticisms of online clothing retailer Asos is that there is too much choice. The grumble is usually uttered by its shoppers, but investors might now justifiably moan along the same lines: after all, you can find a City analyst who says the internet retailer is worth about \u00a33.3bn, then another who reckons its value should be \u00a31.8bn \u2013 which presumably means at least one of them hasn\u2019t got a clue what they\u2019re talking about. Still, a City analyst being clueless is hardly news. What makes this noteworthy is that, as a group, they tend to believe independent thought is like wearing non-khaki chinos to the office on a Friday. On results conference calls, you usually get 20 of them using different words to ask an identical question \u2013 ie, \u201cis the number I have in this cell of my spreadsheet about right?\u201d \u2013 and then they all pootle off to come up with broadly similar valuations. Still, that may make the Asos results day this week more entertaining than most, as one person on the call seems to be convinced Asos\u2019s shares are toppy: his name is Nick Robertson, the group\u2019s founder and boss, and he sold \u00a320m worth in January.",

    "webTitle": "Miliband tearing into utilities\u2019 profits might just spark a fresh look at energy policy", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "This is what political risk for shareholders in utilities can look like. In the month before the 1992 general election shares in UK utilities fell 9% on the expectation that the Labour party, led by Neil Kinnock, would win. In the event, John Major\u2019s Conservatives were victorious and utility shares jumped almost 20% in a day. Deutsche Bank\u2019s analysts this week recalled that contest and said: \u201cWe believe the stakes are similar this year.\u201d Deutsche\u2019s analysts had run the risks on Centrica, owner of British Gas and the company that probably has most to lose if Ed Miliband gets to Downing Street. The Labour leader has pledged to introduce a price cap on energy, which the party says will cut annual bills by \u00a3120 a year on average. In rough terms, that is a 10% price cut. \u201cWe believe Centrica\u2019s shares could be worth at least 20% less under a Labour-led government than a Conservative one,\u201d said Deutsche. Further, under an \u201caggressive\u201d Labour administration, the downside could be 40%, implying a share price of 150p, compared with 259p today. Back in September 2013, just before Miliband made his original \u201cprice freeze\u201d pledge, Centrica shares were trading at 400p. Alarmist? Possibly not. The Competition and Markets Authority is investigating the retail energy market and will report initial findings in May or June. Given the political noise, it is hard to imagine the CMA concluding that the energy market is working splendidly for consumers. \u201cWe believe it is highly likely that the CMA will find aspects of the sector which have adverse effects on competition and will conclude that profits of some energy retailers have been excessive,\u201d says Deutsche. If so, a prime minster Miliband would have the perfect platform from which to launch his get-tough replacement for current regulator Ofgem. One way or another, retail prices, and profits, would be dictated, or at least guided, by government. \u201cWe believe that a Labour threat to impose tougher regulation of energy prices is a credible one, and that it would be unwise to assume retailers would make long-run margins much above 3% under such a system, unless a more generous profitability framework became accepted,\u201d concludes Deutsche. A 3% profit margin, before interest and tax, would be quite a turnaround for British Gas in residential energy. That is roughly what it achieved between 1999 and 2006, but since then the margin has averaged closer to 7%. It would be a shock. Popular politics makes for terrible economics, say defenders of the current set-up. Miliband has not produced clear evidence of profiteering by energy firms, it is argued; and given the integrated structure of the UK\u2019s energy market, in which suppliers are also generators, Labour is risking an investment strike and power black-outs. That last is a reasonable worry. Reserve margins, the percentage of untapped supply during peak demand, have plunged in recent years \u2013 we\u2019re been lucky to have had two mild winters in a row. But, in a roundabout way, we are also fortunate that energy policy is finally near the top of the political agenda. The post-privatisation era has descended into a fog of distorted commercial incentives and general mistrust of corporate power. Almost no one builds plant \u2013 nuclear, wind or gas \u2013 without some form of government guarantee these days. And nobody really knows whether a 3%, 5% or 7% margin is fair at the supply end, or even the appropriate measure. Shouldn\u2019t we be looking at return on capital? Miliband\u2019s prescription \u2013 economic vandalism or overdue reform of a broken market, depending on your point of view \u2013 would at least force resolution of the arguments. A dose of certainty on infrastructure investment, and an accepted definition of fair retail prices, is what this market needs. The stakes are high \u2013 but so they should be. Bank of England economist\u2019s deflation speech gets punctured Bank of England policymakers will be locked in pre-election purdah for the next five weeks to avoid influencing voters. But Mark Carney wasn\u2019t going to pull down the shutters before giving his chief economist, Andy Haldane, a thorough intellectual pasting. Since Haldane gave a speech arguing that wages \u2013 and inflation \u2013 may not bounce back as quickly as the rest of the monetary policy committee thinks, one member after another \u2013 Carney included \u2013 has come out fighting. Kristin Forbes, David Miles and Bank deputy governor Minouche Shafik all lined up last week to say \u201cdeflation, what deflation?\u201d. On Friday Ben Broadbent and Carney himself joined in. With Martin Weale and Ian McCafferty already squarely in the hawkish camp, former Treasury official Jon Cunliffe is the only MPC member not to have distanced himself publicly from Haldane\u2019s view of the world. Haldane\u2019s no politician. He can\u2019t help thinking \u2013 and saying \u2013 the unthinkable. And he\u2019s right to at least ask why wage growth has repeatedly failed to bounce back in line with MPC predictions. Other commentators, including ex-MPC member David Blanchflower and Oxford\u2019s Simon Wren-Lewis, are also asking whether the Bank might have to run the economy hotter \u2013 by cutting rates to zero and/or restarting quantitative easing \u2013 to guard against deflation. Haldane\u2019s analysis \u2013 using the Bank\u2019s own forecasting model \u2013 suggested that even if upbeat wage forecasts are right, the optimal path for policy would still involve cutting rates to zero in the short term. Unlike his predecessor Mervyn King in 2010, Carney has scrupulously avoided commenting on the parties\u2019 tax and spending plans \u2013 which in the Tories\u2019 case require two years of spending cuts more severe than anything seen so far. But if Haldane is right, and the economy is more vulnerable than some suggest, another dose of austerity could be the worst possible medicine. Over-reliant on Chinese tips? The turnaround at London Taxi Company hasn\u2019t been quite as fast as a cabbie rounding Hyde Park Corner, but the shift from administration to 1,000 new jobs and a brand new plant for the maker of black taxis has taken just three years. Under its Chinese owner, Geely, which also owns the Volvo brand, LTC has increased sales and hired more staff, and has plans to develop a clean, green electric cab. All those new jobs can only be great news, but it does pose the question of why LTC\u2019s former owner, Manganese Bronze, couldn\u2019t have raised the investment domestically to pull itself through the dark days of 2012, when it has to recall 400 vehicles because of a steering fault. Jaguar Land Rover, another British basket case rescued by foreign capital, announced last week that it would double the size of its base, in Whitley, Coventry. Only when the next teetering domestic manufacturer is nurtured through hard times by a white knight from London, instead of Hangzhou, will we be able to say this country\u2019s financial system is really fit for purpose.",

      "body": "<p>This is what political risk for shareholders in utilities can look like. In the month before the 1992 general election shares in UK utilities fell 9% on the expectation that the Labour party, led by Neil Kinnock, would win. In the event, John Major\u2019s Conservatives were victorious and utility shares jumped almost 20% in a day. Deutsche Bank\u2019s analysts this week recalled that contest and said: \u201cWe believe the stakes are similar this year.\u201d</p> <p>Deutsche\u2019s analysts had run the risks on Centrica, owner of British Gas and the company that probably has most to lose if Ed Miliband gets to Downing Street. The Labour leader has pledged to introduce a price cap on energy, which the party says will cut annual bills by \u00a3120 a year on average. In rough terms, that is a 10% price cut.</p> <p>\u201cWe believe Centrica\u2019s shares could be worth at least 20% less under a Labour-led government than a Conservative one,\u201d said Deutsche. Further, under an \u201caggressive\u201d Labour administration, the downside could be 40%, implying a share price of 150p, compared with 259p today. Back in September 2013, just before Miliband made his original \u201cprice freeze\u201d pledge, Centrica shares were trading at 400p.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> <blockquote> <p>We believe a Labour threat of tougher regulation is credible. It would be unwise to assume long-run margins much over 3%</p> <footer> <cite>Deutsche Bank</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Alarmist? Possibly not. The Competition and Markets Authority is investigating the retail energy market and will report initial findings in May or June. Given the political noise, it is hard to imagine the CMA concluding that the energy market is working splendidly for consumers.</p> <p>\u201cWe believe it is highly likely that the CMA will find aspects of the sector which have adverse effects on competition and will conclude that profits of some energy retailers have been excessive,\u201d says Deutsche.</p> <p>If so, a prime minster Miliband would have the perfect platform from which to launch his get-tough replacement for current regulator Ofgem. One way or another, retail prices, and profits, would be dictated, or at least guided, by government.</p> <p>\u201cWe believe that a Labour threat to impose tougher regulation of energy prices is a credible one, and that it would be unwise to assume retailers would make long-run margins much above 3% under such a system, unless a more generous profitability framework became accepted,\u201d concludes Deutsche.</p> <p>A 3% profit margin, before interest and tax, would be quite a turnaround for British Gas in residential energy. That is roughly what it achieved between 1999 and 2006, but since then the margin has averaged closer to 7%. It would be a shock.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> <blockquote> <p>Nobody really knows whether a 3%, 5% or 7% margin is fair at the supply end</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Popular politics makes for terrible economics, say defenders of the current set-up. Miliband has not produced clear evidence of profiteering by energy firms, it is argued; and given the integrated structure of the UK\u2019s energy market, in which suppliers are also generators, Labour is risking an investment strike and power black-outs.</p> <p>That last is a reasonable worry. Reserve margins, the percentage of untapped supply during peak demand, have plunged in recent years \u2013 we\u2019re been lucky to have had two mild winters in a row. But, in a roundabout way, we are also fortunate that energy policy is finally near the top of the political agenda.</p> <p>The post-privatisation era has descended into a fog of distorted commercial incentives and general mistrust of corporate power. Almost no one builds plant \u2013 nuclear, wind or gas \u2013 without some form of government guarantee these days. And nobody really knows whether a 3%, 5% or 7% margin is fair at the supply end, or even the appropriate measure. Shouldn\u2019t we be looking at return on capital?</p> <p>Miliband\u2019s prescription \u2013 economic vandalism or overdue reform of a broken market, depending on your point of view \u2013 would at least force resolution of the arguments. A dose of certainty on infrastructure investment, and an accepted definition of fair retail prices, is what this market needs. The stakes are high \u2013 but so they should be.</p> <h2>Bank of England economist\u2019s deflation speech gets punctured<br></h2> <p>Bank of England policymakers will be locked in pre-election purdah for the next five weeks to avoid influencing voters. But Mark Carney wasn\u2019t going to pull down the shutters before giving his chief economist, Andy Haldane, a thorough intellectual pasting.</p> <p>Since Haldane <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/mar/19/interest-rates-may-be-cut-suggests-bank-of-england-chief-economist\" title=\"\">gave a speech</a> arguing that wages \u2013 and inflation \u2013 may not bounce back as quickly as the rest of the monetary policy committee thinks, one member after another \u2013 Carney included \u2013 has come out fighting.</p> <p>Kristin Forbes, David Miles and Bank deputy governor Minouche Shafik all lined up last week to say \u201cdeflation, what deflation?\u201d. On Friday <a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/speeches/2015/813.aspx\" title=\"\">Ben Broadbent</a> and Carney himself joined in. With Martin Weale and Ian McCafferty already squarely in the hawkish camp, former Treasury official Jon Cunliffe is the only MPC member not to have distanced himself publicly from Haldane\u2019s view of the world.</p> <p>Haldane\u2019s no politician. He can\u2019t help thinking \u2013 and saying \u2013 the unthinkable. And he\u2019s right to at least ask why wage growth has repeatedly failed to bounce back in line with MPC predictions. Other commentators, including ex-MPC member David Blanchflower and Oxford\u2019s Simon Wren-Lewis, are also asking whether the Bank might have to run the economy hotter \u2013 by cutting rates to zero and/or restarting quantitative easing \u2013 to guard against deflation.</p> <p>Haldane\u2019s analysis \u2013 using the Bank\u2019s own forecasting model \u2013 suggested that even if upbeat wage forecasts are right, the optimal path for policy would still involve cutting rates to zero in the short term.</p> <p>Unlike his predecessor Mervyn King in 2010, Carney has scrupulously avoided commenting on the parties\u2019 tax and spending plans \u2013 which in the Tories\u2019 case require two years of spending cuts more severe than anything seen so far. But if Haldane is right, and the economy is more vulnerable than some suggest, another dose of austerity could be the worst possible medicine.</p> <h2>Over-reliant on Chinese tips?<br></h2> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/mar/26/taxis-black-cabs-jobs-boost-for-coventry\" title=\"\">turnaround at London Taxi Company</a> hasn\u2019t been quite as fast as a cabbie rounding Hyde Park Corner, but the shift from administration to 1,000 new jobs and a brand new plant for the maker of black taxis has taken just three years.</p> <p>Under its Chinese owner, Geely, which also owns the Volvo brand, LTC has increased sales and hired more staff, and has plans to develop a clean, green electric cab.</p> <p>All those new jobs can only be great news, but it does pose the question of why LTC\u2019s former owner, Manganese Bronze, couldn\u2019t have raised the investment domestically to pull itself through the dark days of 2012, when it has to recall 400 vehicles because of a steering fault.</p> <p>Jaguar Land Rover, another British basket case rescued by foreign capital, announced last week that it would double the size of its base, in Whitley, Coventry.
