      "bodyText": "The \u201cstaggering\u201d increase in energy costs faced by households and businesses will continue thanks to rising gas prices, putting jobs in jeopardy, according to the Australian Industry Group. Warning that last year\u2019s steep price rises are set to become \u201cthe new normal\u201d, the Ai Group says in a report on Tuesday that the complexities of the gas market have combined with a decline in coal-fired power generation to produce a perfect storm for consumers. Wholesale electricity prices are roughly doubling, the report said, and once fully passed through, gas and electricity prices will cost households an extra $3.6bn a year and businesses up to $8.7bn. That equates to about $500 a household, depending on gas use, and about $100,000 just in electricity costs for many small- to medium-sized businesses. Several firms had reported that their energy costs had tripled in 2016, said Ai Group, which surveyed 285 companies across Australia for its report entitled Energy Shock: No Gas, No Power, No Future? The Ai Group chief executive, Innes Wilcox, said price rises would lead some manufacturers to question their viability and consider moving operations overseas. \u201cPolitics-driven energy policies are making a bad situation worse,\u201d he said. \u201cThis includes decisions to put gas development on hold in NSW, Victoria and the Northern Territory, partisan warfare on energy and climate at the federal level, and entirely uncoordinated state renewable energy targets.\u201d The political warfare around energy issues shows no signs of abating with blackouts in South Australia leading to a renewed assault by former prime minister Tony Abbott on the renewable energy target. But the Ai Group report pinpointed the gas market as the main culprit behind the rises. \u201cThe high and rising price of gas means that existing gas-powered [electricity] generators will be significantly more expensive,\u201d the report says. \u201cThe electricity market\u2019s design means that gas generators often set the price for the whole market. And as they generate more often with more expensive fuel this is translating into higher average prices.\u201d One reason for the increasing importance of gas was the decline in coal-fired generation, which suffered from the rise of renewables and lack of flexibility. The closure of Hazelwood power station in Victoria, for example, would have a \u201csignificant impact\u201d on the market. The stations were disappearing for \u201cstrong reasons\u201d, including age and the cost of updating plant. They were increasingly handicapped by the \u201cphysical and financial difficulties inflexible generators face in a market marked by frequent oversupply and occasional shortage\u201d. The emergence of future renewable capacity under the RET would help push prices down, the report said, adding that greener sources of power would one day replace fossil fuels. \u201cLooking to the longer term, market forces and climate goals are likely to make conventional coal and, eventually, gas power unviable, and bring on lots of renewables.\u201d But it said problems remained with the intermittent nature of renewable power and low-cost ways had to be found to to turn \u201can abundance of energy\u201d into a dependable resource. It suggested that better energy storage could stabilise the system and that technologically and geographically diverse generation \u201ccan reduce the impact of intermittency\u201d. Underpinning the surge in power prices was what the report called the \u201chuge change in Australia\u2019s gas markets\u201d since the development of LNG export terminals across the country. This had been expected to link prices to international markets. But the $200bn projects have created supply shortages in the domestic market because the expected output of the fields has not matched up with the amount exporters committed to their clients, meaning they have scrambled to snap up all remaining capacity, pushing up prices for consumers. This has resulted in the \u201ccounterintuitive\u201d outcome whereby international buyers of LNG have been paying \u201cconsiderably lower prices than have Australian buyers of domestic gas\u201d. The outlook for Australia\u2019s gas market is \u201cgrim\u201d, the concludes. To remedy the problems, the report recommends policies to encourage the development of new gas fields and more efficient household case use to ease pressure on supply and demand. It also suggested that despite the huge expenditure on LNG export terminals, one way to reduce Australia\u2019s energy squeeze would be to build an import terminal on the east coast. This would enable suppliers to buy gas on the international market and pass on the lower prices to consumers. But it would cost \u201cseveral hundred million dollars\u201d and the cost would have to be borne by the consumer.",

This deal, unveiled almost 12 months ago, cried out for a public interest study even before the UK voted to leave the European Union. Brexit then piled confusion upon uncertainty. If we don\u2019t know what passporting and clearing arrangements will apply in future, how can anybody sensibly assess the long-term consequences of creating a bigger European mash-up of financial infrastructure? The only surprise is that Brexit wasn\u2019t the immediate cause of the deal\u2019s death, though it may have contributed. The critical event was the last-minute intervention of Margrethe Vestager, the European commission competition commissioner. If you want to proceed, Vestager said, the LSE must sell MTS, the Italy-based electronic platform for trading government bonds. Italian regulators hated the idea that their local assets could be carved up to facilitate a predominantly Anglo-German merger, thus the LSE couldn\u2019t possibly comply. That the only credible buyer of MTS would have been Paris-based Euronext added another twist to the game of competing national interests. An attempted land-grab by the French? Italian intransigence? Or was the German financial establishment, which has never been enamoured by the idea that a merged LSE/Deutsche would be housed under a UK holding company, stirring the pot? In the end, it doesn\u2019t matter. Even if the commission could be persuaded (and, technically, it still can be), other obstacles remained. The German state of Hesse could have objected. And the insider trading investigation into a \u20ac4.5m (\u00a33.8m) share purchase by Carsten Kengeter, the Deutsche chief executive who had been lined up to lead the merged business (and who denies the allegations), is an unresolved difficulty. What matters now is that the LSE prospers in independent form. A merger with Deutsche would have been messy and awkward. But a takeover from the US, in the form of Intercontinental Exchange, owner of the New York Stock Exchange, would be much worse. The LSE would be relegated to junior partner, a grim prospect if a post-Brexit goal for the UK is to retain the City\u2019s status as the financial capital of Europe. There are reasons to be cheerful. First, the LSE has emerged stronger from its many non-mergers over the last 15 years. Second, the jostling of national egos may have made Downing Street appreciate that ownership matters when it comes to stock exchanges, clearing houses and bond trading platforms. Theresa May is preparing to unveil the government stance on foreign takeovers involving \u201ccritical infrastructure\u201d. She should make it crystal clear that bids for the LSE are not welcome, at least until the post-Brexit financial landscape can be mapped. Truss must find compromise on injury payouts The Association of British Insurers thinks the lord chancellor has made a \u201ccrazy\u201d decision. That\u2019s unfair. Liz Truss has merely followed the law in adjusting discount rates \u2013 used in calculating losses in personal injury cases \u2013 to reflect the plunge in gilt yields since 2001. But, yes, there is something silly about a figure of -0.75% that could cause motor premiums to rise steeply and create an annual \u00a31bn bill for the NHS. The system looks outdated. Common sense suggests even risk-averse individuals wouldn\u2019t invest all their lump sums in gilts, certainly not at prices distorted by quantitative easing. A more sensible approach would start by obliging insurers to underwrite long-term investment risk. Since they do so already in some cases \u2013 via a system called periodic payment orders \u2013 a compromise ought to be possible that still allows claimants to receive full and fair compensation. Truss will review the current framework to ensure it remains \u201cfit for purpose\u201d, which suggests she knows it isn\u2019t. PwC holds its hands up for Hollywood PriceWaterhouseCoopers was the auditor on the job at Tesco when the supermarket chain confessed to a \u00a3263m overstatement of profits. The firm also conducted the \u201cfull-scope audit work\u201d at BT\u2019s Italian operations that failed to spot the alleged fraud that ripped a \u00a3530m hole in its last set of numbers. Now comes the real shocker: a cock-up at the Oscars involving La La Land. Only one of these disasters, note, shamed PwC into issuing a \u201csincere apology\u201d. The power of Hollywood is remarkable. Or, rather, auditors tend to get a disgracefully easy ride when calamity strikes at large quoted companies. It is true that PwC lost its audit gig at Tesco (and would be wise to brace for a similar response at BT) but shareholders, unlike Hollywood producers and Oscar viewers, are rarely deemed worthy of a grovelling apology.

      "bodyText": "The price of brazil nuts could rise by more than a fifth after low rainfall hit production in Bolivia where more than half the global crop is grown. The wholesale price of the large curved nut, which is popular for snacking and in muesli, has already risen by more than a quarter to $4.80 a pound (\u00a38.50 a kilogramme) since August after a poor harvest in 2016. Now the industry is warning of a 2017 harvest 30% to 40% down on normal years amid rising demand in the UK, Europe\u2019s biggest importer. The nut grows wild in the Amazonian rainforest and is harvested every year by locals in remote communities. Large pods containing the nuts are collected once they fall into nearby waterways where they can be reached from boats. Each pod can contain up to 30 nuts. The trees, which can grow to about 50 metres and live for a 1,000 years, are not suitable for growing in orchards and grow only in the Amazon region, which covers Brazil and Peru as well as Bolivia. A poor flowering season followed by a lack of rain during the month of November has meant that fewer pods were available before the beginning of the main shipping season in March. \u201cPrices are going up and up and up,\u201d said Ian Dyas, a trader at CG Hacking &amp; Sons, a specialist importer and distributor of nuts. \u201cThe crop collected so far is very little compared with previous years.\u201d Dyas said exporters could usually cover any gap in supply by exporting the remains of the previous year\u2019s crop \u2013 but that limited supplies meant that had already been shipped. \u201cThis year the gathering is very poor,\u201d he said. \u201cThe stock is not there at any price. You can\u2019t get it.\u201d He said it was possible that more stock may become available later as locals traditionally travel further into the forest to gather nuts if they could get a good price for them. Kate Gaskell of Liberation Foods, the UK\u2019s largest importer of Fairtrade nuts, said the drop in production in Bolivia could be up to 50% on last year\u2019s relatively low exports of about 20,000 tonnes of shelled kernels. She said the harvesting of the nuts was vital in maintaining the lifestyle of those in remote rainforest communities. \u201cIf they can\u2019t make a living then they are more vulnerable to loggers and the mines,\u201d she said. The expected fall in supply of brazil nuts comes amid rising demand for them in the UK, as part of the trend for healthier snacks and because of their reputation as a superfood. The nut has a high level of selenium, which is purportedly good for the skin and bolstering immunity. Mark Setterfield, managing director of the importer RM Curtis, said wholesale prices would stay high as demand was growing and the fall in the value of the pound against the dollar since the Brexit vote had also had an impact. \u201cIt\u2019s a potent combination,\u201d he said. But it is not clear whether wholesale price rises will feed through directly to consumers as the popularity of nuts means supermarkets might choose to hold down prices to win over shoppers. Gaskell said food producers, such as those making muesli, might also help keep prices in check by switching away from brazil nuts to other alternatives.",

      "bodyText": "The government\u2019s plan to cut company tax rates has been found by a new report from the Grattan Institute to be a major ongoing cost to the budget and will not improve national income for up to 20 years. In light of figures that show investment has now been falling for over four years, the government\u2019s solution appears to be one that could be worse than the problem. The latest investment figures released last week by the Australian Bureau of Statistics were again disappointing. Private new capital expenditure fell 3.1% in the December quarter \u2013 the 17th quarter in a row: As has been the case throughout the past four years, the main culprit was mining investment \u2013 down 64% on the past four years: The drop matters, especially this week with the GDP figures released on Wednesday. The economy is essentially made up of four things: household spending, government spending, the amount of exports minus the amount imports, and investment. And historically, when investment is falling, the economy is either in a recession or near one. One reason we\u2019re not in a recession now is because the ramp up in investment from 2004 to 2012 involved building mines that are now operational and are exporting absolute masses of iron ore: But investment is a key driver for the economy and for jobs, and is why the government has focused much of its economic policy around lifting investment. Its primary policy to achieve this is the plan to cut the company tax to 25% over 10 years. A report out this week by the Grattan Institute, \u201cStagnation nation? Australian investment in a low-growth world,\u201d however, suggests that while lowering the tax would \u201cprobably attract more foreign investment\u201d it would also \u201creduce national income for years\u201d. And crucially \u2013 in light of the government\u2019s desire to return the budget to surplus \u2013 the report estimates the tax cut will cost the budget $4.8bn a year over the long-term, because the increase in investment will never lead to enough of an increase in tax revenue to compensate for the cut in the tax rate. Pretty much the only impact from cutting the company tax rate is to attract foreign investment. As the governor of the Reserve Bank, Dr Philip Lowe, told the House Economics committee last week, \u201cif you just think about domestic firms ... because we have dividend imputation, I do not think the tax rate really makes that much difference to their investment decisions.\u201d But because other nations around the world have been cutting their company tax rates, all other things being equal, Australia has become less attractive to international investors. Of course all other things are never equal, and while the Grattan Institute suspects lowering the rate will likely attract more investment from overseas, they do note that the recent evidence on whether it will is \u201cmixed\u201d. The report\u2019s author, Jim Minifie notes that foreign direct investment in Australia since 2010 has remained \u201crelatively stable\u201d even while our tax rate has risen relative to other nations. But as the report notes, attracting investment is not an end in itself \u2013 the key issue is whether a company tax cut will improve the living standards of Australians. And here the report suggests that the benefits are rather less tangible. It notes that Australia\u2019s national income would drop by \u201cabout 0.25% ($4bn) immediately after the tax is cut\u201d \u2013 because the benefits in the short term go to foreign investors. And while the report suggests increased international investment would mean in the long run the tax cut \u201cwill probably benefit Australians\u201d, it notes \u201cthe long run\u201d is a ways off. The report cites analysis used by Treasury which suggests that national income will \u201ceventually rise above where it would have been without a tax cut\u201d. But we\u2019re talking in \u201cabout 20 years\u201d \u2013 and that is only after the full cut to 25% has occurred in 2026-27. Due to the long wait for benefits, the uncertainty over the impact on investment, and the hit to the budget, the report concludes that \u201ccommitting to a tax cut before the budget is on a clear path to recovery risks reducing future living standards\u201d. The report is also pretty damming of cuts to the tax rate for small businesses. Of the policy that is favoured by the ALP, the Greens and the Liberal party, the report notes that it \u201cis unlikely to lead to a substantial increase in investment\u201d. The report suggests other measures, such as accelerated depreciation and immediate asset deductibility schemes, which \u201callows firms to write off new capital investments faster\u201d. Yet it also notes this would be a substantial cost to the budget if, unlike the $20,000 accelerated depreciation for small businesses in the 2015-16 budget, it was applied to all businesses. One problem for encouraging investment is that the lending costs for businesses are already extremely low: As a result there is unlikely to be further cuts that might stimulate further investment. The report suggests that government could seek to invest in infrastructure in order to stimulate economic growth. However, it notes that the main problem with infrastructure spending is \u201cfinding quality projects that can be built quickly\u201d. Infrastructure Australia currently has only seven projects currently designated as \u201chigh priority\u201d. Given there is no real silver bullet for improving investment, the story might seem rather gloomy. But the report provides some nice context, pointing out that Australia has had a high level of investment compared to the USA and UK \u2013 even if we exclude mining: And while the latest capital expenditure figures were not good, they contained some pleasing signs for the year ahead. The latest figures contained the first estimate for investment in 2017-18. While the drop in mining investment is set to continue, there was a 7% increase in the estimate for investment in the non-mining sector: That is the best pick-up since 2008-09, and while that doesn\u2019t always translate into actual investment, after four years of falling expectations from 2012-13 to 2015-16, it does appear things are improving. When parts of the economy turn bad, the tendency is for governments to seek a solution. But it is important to ensure the solution to that specific issue actually leads to a better outcome for the economy as whole. The Grattan Institute\u2019s report suggests the government\u2019s policy to cut company tax rate will probably lead to increased investment in the long-term, but less confident that it will lead to benefits for the economy. But the cost to both the economy and the budget in the short-term are very much certain.",

      "bodyText": "The new electric Mini could be made in Germany rather than the UK because of the uncertainty caused by Brexit. Most Minis are manufactured at its plant in Oxford, one of the biggest factories in the country, but BMW, the owner of the brand, is considering making the electric version of the car in Germany. If BMW decides to make the Mini outside of Britain then it would be a major blow to the government. Greg Clark, the business secretary, wants to put electric vehicles and battery technology at the heart of the UK\u2019s industrial strategy, describing the sector as an \u201cemblematic area of focus\u201d. The doubts about where the electric Mini will be built is one of a number of issues threatening to derail the revival of Britain\u2019s car industry. The government persuaded Nissan to commit more investment for its plant in Sunderland but there are fears that jobs could be lost at Vauxhall\u2019s factories in Ellesmere Port and Luton if PSA Group, the owner of Peugeot, completes a deal to buy General Motors\u2019 European business, which includes Vauxhall and Opel. BMW announced the launch of the battery-powered Mini last year and it is scheduled to go on sale in 2019. The German company says it will make a decision this year about where to produce the car. However, the German newspaper Handelsblatt has reported that BMW is considering building the Mini at its plants in Regensburg and Leipzig rather than Oxford. Another option for BMW is to produce the car in the Netherlands, where roughly one in three Minis are already made. The German carmaker is likely to hold talks with the British government before making a decision but is concerned about the prospect of the UK leaving the single market and being charged tariffs on imports and exports. The company insisted it was business as usual at its four sites in the UK. In a statement, it said: \u201cThe decision on where to build the full-electric Mini will be taken this year. \u201cAs formal negotiations between the UK and the EU have not even begun yet it is too early to comment on what Brexit will mean for our business. \u201cThe BMW group has always made clear that we believe integration of the UK into the EU single market, maintaining free movement of goods, services, capital and talent, would be best for business. What\u2019s important for us is that the UK\u2019s negotiations with the EU result in uncomplicated, tariff-free access to the EU single market in future. \u201cAs a major investor and employer in the UK, the BMW group urges the government to take the concerns of international business into account. Not only free trade but also cross-border employment opportunities and unified, internationally applied regulations are of proven benefit to business, the economy and individuals.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Primark has joined luxury brands such as Burberry in enjoying a boost in sales from tourists drawn by the cheap pound. Sales at the cut-price fashion chain\u2019s two stores in Oxford Street, central London, were up 10% in the six months to 4 March as the UK\u2019s premier high street benefitted from an influx of bargain-hunting visitors, particularly from China. That compares with a 2% rise in sales at established stores for the group over the period. John Bason, finance director of Primark\u2019s parent company Associated British Foods, said Oxford Street had been partly helped by a near 40% extension of its store at the eastern end of the street but this had only been in operation for half the period. \u201cIncreased footfall in Oxford Street with tourists was a big driver. All you need to do is look on the street and you can see it,\u201d he said. Bason said there had been no noticeable impact on consumer spending in the UK since Brexit and that \u201cnot a lot\u201d of expected price rises were feeding through on clothing. Although the fall in the value of the pound against the dollar, which is used to buy the bulk of the UK\u2019s clothing from far eastern suppliers, was large Bason said it was being offset by efficiencies in the supply chain. \u201cI think price rises will be later and less than people think because [businesses] are working hard on this,\u201d Bason said. Primark has vowed to take a hit on profits if needed to keep prices low. ABF expects Primark\u2019s sales over the half year to be 11% ahead of last year at constant currency rates, driven by increased retail selling space. With more than half the chain now overseas, the company said total sales would be 21% ahead at actual exchange rates \u2013 boosted by the increase in the value of the euro and the dollar against the pound. Sales at established stores for the group were level but, mainly held back by a decline in the Netherlands, where older stores have been affected by the opening of new Primark outlets. The company expects to open 300,000 sq ft of space in the next quarter with new outlets in Uxbridge in the UK; Charleroi in Belgium; Granada in Spain; Zwolle in the Netherlands and Staten Island in the US, as well as an extension to the Downtown Crossing store in Boston, Primark\u2019s first store in the US in 2015.",

Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority, said a cliff-edge Brexit \u2013 one in which the regulatory framework changes the instant the UK leaves the EU \u2013 also presented competition risks, alongside threats to legal and market stability. In his latest letter to the Treasury select committee, Bailey said a sudden exit from the EU could make it difficult for regulators to obtain information about the firms they regulate. \u201cAny lack of certainty with regard to the regulatory framework may affect the ability of the FCA, and perhaps other regulators, to take enforcement action as a means of both addressing and deterring misconduct,\u201d said Bailey. He also highlighted the risks associated with the sudden loss of the \u201cpassport\u201d that firms based in the EU use to operate freely within the 28 member states. Bailey has previously told the committee that 5,476 UK-registered firms hold at least one passport to do business in another EU or EEA member state while just over 8,000 companies authorised in other EU states use these rules to do business in the UK. There was a risk, he said, that firms could end up without the correct permissions to sell products or find themselves vulnerable to legal action if they were not able to meet pledges to provide services to customers. The FCA may not have enough time to process applications \u2013 which take about 23 weeks \u2013 if the loss of passporting is only agreed late in the negotiations. Bailey also provides an example of the impact of a sudden loss of passporting rights on contracts. Insurers use passporting provisions to conduct their business. \u201cWithout suitable transitional provisions, there may be considerable uncertainty created for firms and consumers as to what the loss of passporting means in practice. We cannot rule out related risks at this stage so my teams are continuing work to map and consider potential mitigations to these risks,\u201d said Bailey. \u201cNone of the above risks are beyond mitigation, but the types of solutions required may be complex,\u201d said Bailey, who added that the FCA may not be able to act alone. Ministerial action and cooperation from other governments and European national regulators may be needed. Former shadow chancellor Chris Leslie, a leading supporter of the Open Britain campaign, said: \u201cThe last thing post-Brexit Britain needs is to tie the hands of the Financial Conduct Authority behind their back. A hard Brexit doesn\u2019t just risk pushing our economy over a cliff edge, it risks throwing robust regulation into the void as well. \u201cIf we learned anything from the 2008 global economic crash, it is that a clear system of regulation for financial services is essential. It is deeply worrying that the people responsible for that in this country are saying they will not be able to do their job properly if Britain crashes out of the EU without a transitional deal in place. \u201cWhen the financial watchdog are themselves saying they will not be able to properly protect consumers following a hard Brexit, the government needs to sit up and take notice. \u201cIf the watchdog cannot watch financial transactions properly, we are leaving both peoples\u2019 finances and markets vulnerable to abuse.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "A \u201creckless\u201d government-ordered change to the way awards are calculated for car crash injuries or botched medical operations will add up to \u00a375 car insurance premiums, and land the NHS with an additional annual \u00a31bn bill, the insurance industry has warned. The lord chancellor, Liz Truss, has announced a change to the Ogden discount rate, which is used to calculate compensation awards for serious personal injuries, to ensure inflation does not erode the future value of a payout. Sarah Stanton, a partner at Moore Blatch law firm, said the change would make an \u201cenormous difference to claimants with life-changing injuries, particularly given that interest rates have been low for several years\u201d. However, the unexpectedly deep cut in this rate, from 2.5% to -0.75%, has prompted a furious backlash amid claims that it will \u201covercompensate\u201d victims of car crashes or medical incompetence in hospitals. The armed forces could also face far higher bills. Mohammad Khan, an insurance expert at PricewaterhouseCoopers, said: \u201cAs a direct result of this change, we anticipate an increase of \u00a350-\u00a375 on an average comprehensive motor insurance policy, with higher increases for younger and older drivers \u2013 potentially up to \u00a31,000 for younger drivers (18 to 22) and a rise of up to \u00a3300 for older drivers (over 65).\u201d Figures calculated for the Guardian by insurer LV= underscore the dramatic impact of how the rate change feeds through to huge increases in payouts. It said that if a 25-year-old sustained a moderate brain injury and was awarded \u00a3100,000 a year for life, under the old system the total payout would be calculated as \u00a33.1m. But under the new discount rate, the same person would be awarded \u00a38m. \u201cThe old multiplier, based upon a 2.5% rate, was 31, giving a \u00a33.1m [figure for] future losses. That multiplier is now going to be 80, resulting in \u00a38m in damages,\u201d said LV=. In the year to March 2016, the NHS Litigation Authority (NHSLA) in England paid out \u00a31.49bn in claims for clinical negligence, a rise of 27% on the year before. It declined to comment on how the change in the discount rate may affect future costs, but if the LV= example is used, it indicates that the NHS bill could soar towards \u00a33bn. But Truss allayed fears that intensely-pressurised NHS budgets would be raided to fund higher compensation payouts, pledging that new money would be made available. There are concerns that much of the increased payouts will fall into the hands of no-win, no-fee lawyers pursuing the NHS. The NHSLA said that in 2015-16, of payouts of \u00a3100,000 or less, where no-win, no-fee cases are common, 55% of all the compensation went to the hands of solicitors. The Association of British Insurers said the rate cut was \u201creckless in the extreme\u201d. \u201cWe have repeatedly warned the government that this could lead to very significant price rises, with younger drivers in particular likely to find it much harder to get affordable insurance. It is also a massive own goal that lands the NHS with a likely \u00a31bn hike in compensation bills when it needs it the least,\u201d said Huw Evans, the ABI director general. \u201cCutting the discount rate to -0.75% from 2.5% is a crazy decision by Liz Truss. Claims costs will soar, making it inevitable that there will be an increase in motor and liability premiums for millions of drivers and businesses across the UK. We estimate that up to 36m individual and business motor insurance policies could be affected in order to overcompensate a few thousand claimants a year.\u201d Small businesses could also be hit, PwC warned, as they face higher commercial insurance rates to protect themselves against liability claims, for example from members of the public falling over in a shop or a workplace. The shares for the UK\u2019s two biggest motor insurers fell sharply after the Ministry of Justice announcement, with Admiral plunging nearly 9% and Direct Line losing 7.5% at one stage although losses were pared back in later trading. . Admiral said the change would reduce its 2016 profits by \u00a370m to \u00a3100m and postponed publication of its results. Direct Line, which last week delayed its results ahead of the rate review, warned on Monday that its 2016 profits would fall by \u201cbetween \u00a3215m and \u00a3230m\u201d \u2013 more than a third of the \u00a3526m profits forecast by analysts. The CBI said the decision subjected insurance companies to a \u201clarge and sudden shock at a time when stability and predictability should be prioritised\u201d. Insurance brokerage Willis Towers Watson estimates the rate change will cost the insurance industry a one-off charge of \u00a35.8bn to boost reserves, and a further \u00a3850m per year increase in the cost of providing motor insurance. Insurers also said the rate cut would wipe out any benefit to drivers from recently announced reforms to whiplash claims, which were expected to cut between \u00a340 and \u00a350 from premiums. The forecast increase in premiums comes as insurance rates rise steeply, partly because of hikes in insurance premium tax, which will increase again from 10% to 12% in June. Personal injury lawyers have argued that the Ogden rate has not changed since 2001 and needs to be amended to reflect historically low interest rates. Truss said the new rate was the only \u201clegally acceptable\u201d rate she could set and promised that the NHS would be given enough funds to allow it to make payments. Four key pledges will be made, she said. \u201cThe government has committed to ensuring that the NHS Litigation Authority has appropriate funding to cover changes to hospitals\u2019 clinical negligence costs,\u201d Truss said, adding that GPs and medical defence organisations will ensure appropriate funding is available to meet additional costs. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, will meet representatives of the insurance industry to assess the impact of the rate adjustment, Truss said, adding that the new discount rate will come into effect on 20 March, following amendments to current legislation. A consultation before Easter will consider the establishment of an independent body to set the rate and a change in the methodology behind it. David Johnson, a partner at law firm Weightmans, said the decision \u201cwill drastically increase the size of lump-sum payments across the scale of serious personal injury cases\u201d. \u201cFor those who compensate these claims, the annual claims outlay will potentially increase by tens of millions of pounds as a result of this change. This obviously affects insurers, but also organisations including the NHS, the armed forces and the Motor Insurers\u2019 Bureau, which is liable for claims against uninsured drivers,\u201d he said. \u201cUltimately, these increased costs will be funded by policyholders and already overstretched public finances. \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing that this radical change has been made in the absence of any meaningful studies into how damages are typically invested and the rates of return they can expect to receive. The rate of 2.5%, set in 2001, was based on returns generated by index-linked government stocks, but in reality that is not how the vast majority of claimants choose to invest the damages they are awarded, and that needs to be understood if we are to identify a fair rate.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Sterling has recovered from its worse levels but is still lower on the day, following renewed worries about the consequences of Brexit and talk of a second Scottish referendum. The pound is currently down 0.34% at $1.2424 against the dollar having fallen as low as $1.2385. Against the euro, it is 0.67% lower at \u20ac1.1713. Against a basket of currencies, sterling is also on the slide: On that note, we\u2019re closing up for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Ahead of President Trump\u2019s address to Congress on Tuesday, US markets have opened lower after their recent record breaking runs. The Dow Jones Industrial Average - which closed at a record high for the 11th day in a row on Friday - is down 32 points or 0.16% with technology shares among the decliners. The S&amp;P 500 opened 0.11% lower while the Nasdaq Composite lost 0.19% as trading began. Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, said: The first set of durable goods figures from Donald Trump\u2019s presidency show a rebound after a disappointing December, but there is still plenty of work ahead for the White House administration. Trump has spoken at length about his plans to cut taxes and boost infrastructure spending in the manufacturing industry \u2013 but his camp is still very light on details. While demand in American production rocketed after his shock election win, doubts continue to build over how many of his promises he\u2019ll actually keep, which could see the often erratic durable goods market continue to wobble for the time being. More mixed signals from the US economy ahead of Donald Trump\u2019s speech to Congress on Tuesday. New orders for US capital goods fell 0.4% in January, defying expectations of a 0.5% increase. However December\u2019s rise of 0.7% was revised upwards to 1.1%. There were declines in January for electrical equipment, appliances and components, and increases for machinery and metal products. Analysts said the decline last month probably reflected businesses holding fire as they awaited Trump\u2019s plans for tax reforms - \u201cphenomenal\u201d reforms at that - and increased infrastructure spending. But durable goods orders rose 1.8% compared to expectations of a 1.7% increase, although December\u2019s 0.5% fall was revised to a 0.8% decline. Excluding transportation, durable goods orders fell 0.2% in January. The pound may be weaker at the moment thanks to the latest Brexit anxieties and the prospect of a second Scottish referendum, but it is an event across the Atlantic which will prove key to the outlook for the UK currency, says Kathleen Brooks, research director at City Index: While Brexit headlines are dominating on an otherwise quiet Monday, we have no idea if Theresa May will actually block freedom of movement, or if she can do this from legal standpoint at this early stage of our Brexit negotiation. We are still years away from officially leaving the EU and a Scottish referendum on independence is unlikely to happen for the next two years. Thus, today\u2019s reports may not materialise for some time, which is why we think that there impact will be fleeting. In contrast, the immediate risk to the pound could come from President Trump\u2019s address to Congress on Tuesday. The dollar and the US bond market seem to have lost faith in Trumpenomics, 10-year US Treasury yields fell to their lowest level since November on Friday and the dollar index is 2% away from its December high. If Trump can put flesh on the bones of his pro-growth economic plans, then US bond yields could rise and drag the dollar with them, if he fails to do this then we could see further dollar weakness... So, don\u2019t put too much stock on Brexit headlines and Monday\u2019s price action. Trump\u2019s speech is a far more important risk even this week, and could determine whether we see further weakness back to $1.20 or if we get a recovery rally back towards $1.27... The real price movement is likely to happen late Tuesday/ early Wednesday, Trump will talk at 0200 GMT. Set your alarm clocks on Tuesday night and get ready for this week\u2019s most important event for sterling. Back with the European business sentiment survey, and here\u2019s a look at how confident various countries are: And here\u2019s the overall trend: Billionaire US investor Warren Buffett - recently involved in the unsuccessful move by Kraft Heinz on Unilever - has been speaking on CNBC after his annual report to shareholders was released at the weekend. He says his holding in Apple is now the second biggest stake in his Berkshire Hathaway company, and gave some views on the current state of the stock market. The changes to compensation payments continue to hit shares in the insurers, and are also likely to see premiums rise and the NHS facing extra costs of an estimated \u00a31bn. Patrick Collinson and Julia Kollewe report: A \u201creckless\u201d government-ordered change to the way personal injury awards are calculated will add as much as \u00a375 to already fast-rising average car insurance premiums, and land the NHS with an annual \u00a31bn bill, the insurance industry has warned. The lord chancellor, Liz Truss, has announced a change to the so-called \u201cOgden\u201d discount rate \u2013 which is used to calculate compensation awards for serious personal injuries \u2013 to ensure inflation does not erode the future value of a payout. However, the unexpectedly deep cut in this rate, from 2.5% to -0.75%, has prompted a furious backlash, amid claims it will \u201cover-compensate\u201d victims of car crashes or medical incompetence in hospitals. The armed forces could also face far higher bills. Mohammad Khan, insurance expert at PwC said: \u201cAs a direct result of this change, we anticipate an increase of \u00a350-\u00a375 on an average comprehensive motor insurance policy, with higher increases for younger and older drivers \u2013 potentially up to \u00a31,000 for younger drivers (18-22-year-olds) and a rise of up to \u00a3300 for older drivers (over 65 years old).\u201d The Association of British Insurers (ABI) said the cut was \u201creckless in the extreme\u201d. Huw Evans, its director general, said: \u201cWe have repeatedly warned the government that this could lead to very significant price rises, with younger drivers in particular likely to find it much harder to get affordable insurance. It is also a massive own goal that lands the NHS with a likely \u00a31bn hike in compensation bills when it needs it the least.\u201d The full story is here: Here\u2019s ING economist Bert Colijn on the eurozone confidence figures: While consumer confidence declined somewhat in February as inflation rates have recently increased, businesses continue to see sentiment improve. In manufacturing, new orders continued to improve significantly, while also the assessment of recent production has improved. The exports component also improved, indicating that the manufacturing sector is profiting from the recent weakening of the euro. In services, assessments of recent demand have surged, with expectations for future demand increasing as well. This shows that the first quarter could come in stronger than expected. One of the main reasons for the current economic strength is the tailwind from the labour market. Businesses are hiring at the fastest pace in years, which is also confirmed by this release of the economic sentiment index. In February, the pace of hiring increased further in manufacturing. In services, recent job growth was slightly weaker than in January, but employment expectations for the coming months increased. This shows that employers seem unfazed by the uncertainty coming from the packed political agenda in the Eurozone. Consumers may be less unnerved, their expectations for general economic conditions and future unemployment chances weakened in February. Consumers also indicated a jump in recent price growth. While this matches the headline inflation rate jump, their expectations of future price growth also increased in February. This is in line with selling price expectations increasing in manufacturing and remaining at a high level in services. The question becomes when these survey indicators are going to cause an increase in the core inflation rate, which has been stagnant so far. We expect that this starts to translate in slightly higher core inflation in the coming months, but nothing that will boost the core rate anywhere near 2% for now. The ECB will present their latest macroeconomic forecasts next month and it will be interesting to see whether the recent bout of strong indicators has impacted their core inflation forecasts. Eurozone confidence edged up in February, with positive views from industry and the service sector outweighing weakness among consumers and the retail area. The European Commission\u2019s monthly sentiment index rose from 107.9 in January to 108. A business confidence indicator rose from 0.76 points in January to 0.82, the highest level since June 2011. Back with the insurers, and PWC have crunched the numbers and calculated how much the new regime would push up premiums. Mohammad Khan, UK general insurance leader at PwC, said: The Lord Chancellor\u2019s announcement on the Ogden rate change to -0.75% was not anticipated by the insurance industry and is more than they were expecting. Unfortunately, this announcement will have a significant adverse impact on motor insurance prices that drivers pay and also commercial insurance rates paid by small businesses. As a direct result of this change, we anticipate an increase of \u00a350-\u00a375 on an average comprehensive motor insurance policy, with higher increases for younger and older drivers \u2013 potentially up to \u00a31,000 for younger drivers (18-22 year olds) and a rise of up to \u00a3300 for older drivers (over 65 years old). This announcement, on top of the recent increases in insurance premium tax, will make redundant any savings to premiums as a result of the government\u2019s personal injury legal reforms which were anticipated to generate approximately \u00a340 saving per motor insurance policy... The announcement will also impact reinsurance pricing by pushing prices up for motor and liability reinsurance cover. This may impact the business models of companies that rely on low layers of reinsurance who will be faced with much higher costs of doing business after they renew their reinsurance. (Perhaps PWC should award the Lord Chancellor the Best Oscar for an unexpected announcement.... or perhaps not) The weakness in the pound may not last despite the Times report (\u00a3) about a possible second Scottish referendum, says Lee Hardman, currency analyst at MUFG: The report is highly speculative at the current juncture, and we doubt that it will have a lasting negative impact on the pound. Also, opinion polls have shown a modest increase in support for Scottish independence since the Brexit vote, but it remains far from clear that holding another referendum would have a different result. We still continue to expect the pound to strengthen in the coming months benefitting from rising political risk in Europe. ING also believes the eurozone lending figures will not lead to the ECB changing policy yet. Its senior eurozone economist Bert Colijn said: The current recovery in lending is no doubt related to the current loose monetary policy of the ECB. The cost of borrowing has come down to historical lows for both households and businesses, which in part drives the recovery of lending in the Eurozone. Still, with lending growth well below pre-crisis levels for the moment, it seems unlikely that the ECB will take as an argument to make changes to the QE program set out for 2017. Economic growth is picking up in the Eurozone for the moment and accelerating loan growth is underpinning that for the moment. This means that GDP growth may well have further upside in the coming months although political uncertainty continues to loom. Some positive lending figures from the eurozone: IHS Markit economist Archer adds: The ECB will likely point to the January lending data as providing ongoing evidence that its monetary policy is providing valuable support to Eurozone growth and should not be changed any time soon \u2013 particularly as the Eurozone is yet to see a convincing upward trend in underlying inflation (it was stable at just 0.9% in January). Additionally, while the ECB is relatively upbeat on Eurozone growth prospects, it is very aware that there are appreciable uncertainties ahead, especially political ones (elections in Netherlands, France and Germany, the Brexit process starting and Trump\u2019s presidency in the US)... The ECB has set out its asset buying programme until the end of the year, and we suspect it will not re-visit it until late on in 2017, very possibly waiting until the German election is out of the way in September. The pound is continuing to weaken, as worries about a second referendum in Scotland and concerns about the outcome of Brexit talks continue. Sterling is currently down 0.5% at $1.2402 against the dollar and 0.59% lower against the euro. On the changes to compensation payments, the Association of British Insurers called the decision \u201ccrazy\u201d and predicted it would lead to higher premiums and a \u00a31bn hike in NHS costs. ABI director general Huw Evans said: Cutting the discount rate to -0.75% from 2.5% is a crazy decision by Liz Truss. Claims costs will soar, making it inevitable that there will be an increase in motor and liability premiums for millions of drivers and businesses across the UK. We estimate that up to 36 million individual and business motor insurance policies could be affected in order to over-compensate a few thousand claimants a year. To make such a significant change to the rate using a broken formula is reckless in the extreme, and shows an utter disregard for the impact this will have on consumers, businesses and the wider operation of the insurance market. We have repeatedly warned the Government that this could lead to very significant price rises, with younger drivers in particular likely to find it much harder to get affordable insurance. It is also a massive own goal that lands the NHS with a likely \u00a31billion hike in compensation bills when it needs it the least. Over in Europe, markets have also opened brightly. Germany\u2019s Dax and France\u2019s Cac are both up around 0.4%, with the pan-European Stoxx 600 up 0.1%. The banking sector was helped by a rally in Intesa Sanpaolo after the Italian bank said it had abandoned plans to take over insurer Generali. The gains came despite a 3% drop in Deutsche B\u00f6rse on new doubts about its planned merger with the London Stock Exchange. The dip in the pound is of course good for the FTSE 100, which is packed full of dollar earners who benefit from a weaker sterling. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: Brexit fears are back on the agenda this Monday morning, with the pound bearing the brunt of investors\u2019 fretful trading. Sterling fell 0.5% against the dollar and 0.6% against the euro as the day got underway, following on from the losses seen last Friday. The reason behind the pound\u2019s morning wobbles seems to be speculation surrounding a second Scottish independence referendum, alongside Amber Rudd\u2019s comments on Sunday that Brexit will \u2018end freedom of movement as we know it\u2019. The currency\u2019s slide was good news, however, for the FTSE, which rose around 20 points after the bell, though that increase still leaves the UK index adrift of its persistent 7300 resistance level. The UK market has got off to a good start for the week, with the FTSE 100 up around 0.4%. Positive updates from Persimmon and Associated British Foods have helped, but the London Stock Exchange has dropped nearly 2% on doubts about its planned merger with Deutsche B\u00f6rse. But the biggest decline is in the insurance sector, after proposed changes in compensation payments which could hit company profits: Associated British Foods, which owns discount fashion retailer Primark as well as a sugar business, has issued a positive trading statement. It said it had seen \u201cexcellent progress\u201d in the first half, with strong growth at Primark and better performances in its other businesses. In a buy note, Liberum analysts said: Despite a tough retail environment, Primark sales rose 21% driven by 11% new space growth, flat like for like and favourable foreign exchange. Primark\u2019s EBIT margin remains pressured by adverse foreign exchange. Sugar profitability is strongly improving driven by cost savings, lower beet costs and improved pricing coupled with strong production in Africa. In [the full year] we expect a strong rebound in group profits as sugar profits recover and Primark continues a strong store roll-out program. ABF offers compelling exposure to secular growth trends in retail over the next 5-10 years. We estimate Primark can double sales and profits over the next 5 years. More on the changes to insurance payments, which has already forced Admiral to postpone its results. Here\u2019s Reuters: Britain on Monday changed the rate at which compensation payments are calculated in personal injury claims, a move likely to increase the size of lump sum pay outs and potentially hit UK motor insurers\u2019 profits. The Ministry of Justice cut the discount rate used to calculate lump sum payouts to minus 0.75 percent from 2.5 percent, it said in a statement, a rate that had been in place since 2001. A downwards move in the discount rate is expected to force insurers to pay out more in cash to personal injury claimants now to ensure that returns over their lifetime met the awarded compensation. \u201cThe current legal framework makes clear that claimants must be treated as risk-averse investors, reflecting the fact that they may be financially dependent on this lump sum, often for long periods or the duration of their life,\u201d the Ministry of Justice said. Admiral said on Monday it was postponing the publication of its annual results as a result of the change, to March 8 from March 1. The news is likely to see the sector\u2019s share prices come under pressure. Despite the dip in Asian markets, Europe is expected to open higher: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The pound is under pressure again this morning following reports that Scotland would call for another independence referendum, and that UK prime minister Theresa May could play tough over residency rights for EU nationals, once Article 50 is triggered. Sterling is down 0.35% against the dollar at $1.2422 having earlier fallen as low as $1.2392. It is a similar amount down against the euro to \u20ac1.1754. Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior market analyst at London Capital Group, said: Speculations that Scotland could call for another independence vote hammered the mood in the pound market at the start of the week. The pound tanked to #1.2392 at the early hours of the Asian session, as the Times of London reported that Scotland could ask for a second vote of independency as PM Theresa May triggers the Article 50 in March. Although there is no need for additional panic at this point in time, the week started with Brexit related concerns and the current deterioration in the sentiment could dent the appetite in the pound and encourage more bears to join the sell-off at the start of the trading week. Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets UK, added: Theresa May likes to play hard without knowing how devastating the results could be for the UK. She wants to negotiate a good deal with her EU partners and yet she has upped the ante against freedom of movement. It is reported that any EU national who arrives in the UK before the date Brexit is triggered will not automatically get the right to reside permanently in the UK. Not only has she set the stage for nothing but a mess by fighting against those with whom she wants to negotiate with, but also there are reports that Scotland could call for a referendum next year. All this negative development, which has mostly been self-inflicted by Theresa May, is going to make the sterling the least desirable currency against a basket of currencies. Meanwhile Asian markets have edged lower, with investors cautious ahead of Donald Trump\u2019s address to Congress on Tuesday. Analysts are anticipating more details of his proposed \u201cphenomenal\u201d news on tax reforms, plus any other moves to boost the US economy. Ahead of all that, US durable goods figures are due later, with Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, saying: We are expected to get further evidence of the improvement in the US economy with January core durable goods orders which are expected to come in at 0.5%, unchanged from December. We\u2019ll also be keeping an eye on shares in the London Stock Exchange, which said late on Sunday that its proposed merger with Deutsche B\u00f6rse was in doubt after European regulators asked it to sell its majority stake in Italian trading business MTS. The full story is here: There is also a trading update from Primark owner Associated British Foods, and insurance shares could come under pressure after a change in the discount rate for calculating personal injury damages awards.",

The dollar and the US bond market seem to have lost faith in Trumpenomics, 10-year US Treasury yields fell to their lowest level since November on Friday and the dollar index is 2% away from its December high.

In manufacturing, new orders continued to improve significantly, while also the assessment of recent production has improved. The exports component also improved, indicating that the manufacturing sector is profiting from the recent weakening of the euro. In services, assessments of recent demand have surged, with expectations for future demand increasing as well. This shows that the first quarter could come in stronger than expected.</p> <p>One of the main reasons for the current economic strength is the tailwind from the labour market. Businesses are hiring at the fastest pace in years, which is also confirmed by this release of the economic sentiment index. In February, the pace of hiring increased further in manufacturing. In services, recent job growth was slightly weaker than in January, but employment expectations for the coming months increased.</p> <p>This shows that employers seem unfazed by the uncertainty coming from the packed political agenda in the Eurozone. Consumers may be less unnerved, their expectations for general economic conditions and future unemployment chances weakened in February.</p> <p>Consumers also indicated a jump in recent price growth. While this matches the headline inflation rate jump, their expectations of future price growth also increased in February. This is in line with selling price expectations increasing in manufacturing and remaining at a high level in services. The question becomes when these survey indicators are going to cause an increase in the core inflation rate, which has been stagnant so far. We expect that this starts to translate in slightly higher core inflation in the coming months, but nothing that will boost the core rate anywhere near 2% for now. The ECB will present their latest macroeconomic forecasts next month and it will be interesting to see whether the recent bout of strong indicators has impacted their core inflation forecasts.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58b3fc98e4b030b6f7c8f996\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-02-27T10:19:33.377Z\">10.19am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Eurozone confidence edged up in February, with positive views from industry and the service sector outweighing weakness among consumers and the retail area.</strong></p> <p>The European Commission\u2019s monthly sentiment index rose from 107.9 in January to 108.

It is a similar amount down against the euro to \u20ac1.1754. Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior market analyst at London Capital Group, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Speculations that Scotland could call for another independence vote hammered the mood in the pound market at the start of the week. The pound tanked to #1.2392 at the early hours of the Asian session, as the Times of London reported that Scotland could ask for a second vote of independency as PM Theresa May triggers the Article 50 in March.</p> <p>Although there is no need for additional panic at this point in time, the week started with Brexit related concerns and the current deterioration in the sentiment could dent the appetite in the pound and encourage more bears to join the sell-off at the start of the trading week. </p> </blockquote> <p>Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets UK, added:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Theresa May likes to play hard without knowing how devastating the results could be for the UK. She wants to negotiate a good deal with her EU partners and yet she has upped the ante against freedom of movement. It is reported that any EU national who arrives in the UK before the date Brexit is triggered will not automatically get the right to reside permanently in the UK.</p> <p>Not only has she set the stage for nothing but a mess by fighting against those with whom she wants to negotiate with, but also there are reports that Scotland could call for a referendum next year.</p> <p>All this negative development, which has mostly been self-inflicted by Theresa May, is going to make the sterling the least desirable currency against a basket of currencies.</p> </blockquote> <p>Meanwhile Asian markets have edged lower, with investors cautious ahead of Donald Trump\u2019s address to Congress on Tuesday. Analysts are anticipating more details of his proposed \u201cphenomenal\u201d news on tax reforms, plus any other moves to boost the US economy.</p> <p>Ahead of all that, US durable goods figures are due later, with Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, saying:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We are expected to get further evidence of the improvement in the US economy with January core durable goods orders which are expected to come in at 0.5%, unchanged from December. </p> </blockquote> <p>We\u2019ll also be keeping an eye on shares in the London Stock Exchange, which said late on Sunday that its proposed merger with Deutsche B\u00f6rse was in doubt after European regulators asked it to sell its majority stake in Italian trading business MTS.

      "bodyText": "On a blustery morning Germans reach for their trusty Jack Wolfskin jacket while the French typically throw on a Lafuma waterproof. But the default British national anorak brand these days is Mountain Warehouse. The no-frills retailer, which opened its first branch in Swindon nearly 20 years ago, has quietly conquered the UK\u2019s outdoor clothing market, overtaking established chains such as Millets and Blacks with reliable gear particularly beloved of middle-aged dog walkers. \u201cOur best customer is someone like my mum,\u201d says Mark Neale, Mountain Warehouse\u2019s founder and chief executive. \u201cShe is 75 and has never heard of Gore-Tex. She\u2019s not going to go into one of our competitors and start talking about what the snow\u2019s like in Chamonix. It\u2019s value for money clothing that keeps you warm and dry.\u201d Mountain Warehouse has been growing at more than 20% a year, with sales expected to exceed \u00a3200m this year, as it expands at home and tackles the foothills of vast new markets such as the USA and Canada. Neale sees a gap for utilitarian fleeces and rucksacks that don\u2019t break the bank in a market where big marketing budgets are deployed to convince shoppers to shell out for hi-tech performance fabrics with names like \u201cWindwall\u201d and \u201cAquaguard\u201d. Mountain Warehouse has also prospered amid a slow turnaround of the loss-making Millets and Blacks brands, which were rescued by JD Sports five years ago. The 49-year-old Welshman is a serial entrepreneur who after several false starts \u2013 including an ill-starred rollerblade chain \u2013 found a winning formula in Mountain Warehouse. Today it has 201 stores in the UK and delivered a pre-tax profit of \u00a316.2m on sales of \u00a3141.1m last year. Unlike rivals, the only outside label the retailer sells is Kendal Mint Cake, making Mountain Warehouse the UK\u2019s biggest outdoor clothing brand. Neale is half of a business power couple. His wife Michelle Feeney, who ran self-tanning brand St Tropez, is working on a new beauty business and sits on the advisory board of private equity firm Palatine. The couple\u2019s other investments include the upmarket cafe brand Fig &amp; Favour, the first of which opened in Hagley, Worcestershire, near their country house. The success of Mountain Warehouse has propelled Neale into newspaper rich lists, with a recent poll causing a stir with his family after it ranked the anorak salesman ahead of Welsh national hero Tom Jones. Neale, who grew up in Ebbw Vale, a former steel town in the heart of the Welsh valleys, dismisses \u201call the wealth rubbish\u201d but paraphrases Lord Kinnock, describing himself as the \u201cfirst Neale in a thousand generations\u201d to go to university. Both his parents worked in the Ebbw Vale Steelworks but after winning a scholarship to the Haberdashers\u2019 Monmouth School he went on to study physics at Bailliol College, Oxford, where peers included Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, and Labour MP Yvette Cooper. After graduating he endured a short stint as a management consultant in the City but \u201cchucked it in\u201d when he was 25 to open a shop. He recently gave a talk at his old school encouraging students to do the same. \u201cSo many of the young people I was at university with were drawn into world of professional services or politics,\u201d he says. \u201cBut why not do something more productive with your talents in the way that young people in Germany do?\u201d Although he was for remain, Neale, who operates more stores in the Lake District than London, saw Brexit coming. In Ebbw Vale, 62% of the population \u2013 the highest proportion in Wales \u2013 voted leave. \u201cMy mum and dad were voting for Brexit,\u201d he says. \u201cEveryone in the Midlands and Wales [that I spoke to] was very Brexit focused.\u201d The retailer\u2019s expansion has not been derailed by the Brexit vote, with the buoyant sales picture encouraging it to press on with 20 UK store openings this year. Last autumn Neale feared its clothing prices would have to rise following the devaluation of sterling against the dollar but says the depreciation of China\u2019s renminbi against the greenback \u2013 as well as better deals struck with suppliers keen to get their hands on its high volume orders \u2013 means they are no longer necessary. After working with several private equity backers \u2013 Italian, Greek, Icelandic and finally the UK taxpayer in the shape of Lloyds Banking Group\u2019s venture capital arm \u2013 Neale bought the business back in 2013 in a \u00a385m deal backed by RBS. He now owns 85% of the equity with the remainder held by 20 senior managers. Mountain Warehouse is also pressing on with store openings in North America, where it has established a bulkhead of 30 stores. \u201cIn the US the competition is lots of people selling branded jackets at expensive prices, there isn\u2019t really anyone doing family friendly, value for money,\u201d he says. Rather than set up shop with a fanfare on New York\u2019s Fifth Avenue, the retailer quietly debuted in a suburban Detroit mall in 2014. \u201cWe opened in the Midwest on the basis a clever location fifth avenue would cost a fortune and wouldn\u2019t necessarily be replicable. But if I could ... make a success of it [Detroit] then I could have 500 shops in America,\u201d says Neale. Neil Saunders, analyst at US-based GlobalData Retail, says the US could be a lucrative market because Americans spend more on outdoor clothing than Britons. But he cautions: \u201cThe landscape is crowded with both specialist and general players [such as Walmart and Target] who have cashed in on America\u2019s love of the outdoors. That said, most of these retailers operate from large warehouse type formats so by choosing a less saturated location, Mountain Warehouse could have found a gap in the market.\u201d Neale\u2019s ambition is to become a global rather than national household name. \u201cWe think there\u2019s an opportunity to be an international value brand,\u201d he says. \u201cNorth Face is the only truly global brand and it\u2019s in the high price part of market.\u201d Another six Mountain Warehouse shops in North America are in prospect as well as expansion in Poland. He also has other continents in mindand is currently scouting locations in Australia and New Zealand. Mountain Warehouse has already overtaken North Face in sales terms in the UK but has a way to go to match the brand\u2019s $2.3bn (\u00a31.8m) global sales last year. Neale says that in encounters with North Face executives the company has appeared unmoved about his North American plans. But maybe the trendy US brand should be keeping an eye out for Mountain Warehouse anoraks on their travels.",

      "bodyText": "Sales of Fairtrade goods have risen for the first time since 2013 as the increasing popularity of bananas and coffee sold under the ethical label offset falling sales of cocoa and sugar. Revenues from produce overseen by the Fairtrade Foundation body, which guarantees a minimum price to farmers and additional payments for use on social projects such as schools or clean water provision, rose 2% to \u00a31.64bn in the UK last year. \u201cWe are in growth despite tough economic times and while the grocery market continues to be in disarray,\u201d said Michael Gidney, chief executive of Fairtrade. \u201cThere is a sense of businesses committing to Fairtrade backed by unstinting support from the public.\u201d The sales will trigger payments of about \u00a330m in premiums, on top of the price paid for goods, for use in social projects in developing countries including Malawi and the Dominican Republic. The volume of bananas, by far the biggest Fairtrade product in the UK, rose 6% amid strong sales at the likes of Sainsbury\u2019s and Waitrose, which only stock the Fairtrade version of the fruit, while Tesco, the UK\u2019s biggest retailer, began stocking Fairtrade bananas for the first time. Coffee sales rose 8%, while Starbucks launched Fairtrade coffee via its Seattle Best Coffee label which it delivers to offices and other businesses. Lidl also began stocking Fairtrade tea and coffee last year again after delisting it for about a year. Tea and cocoa sales both slid 3%, again partly as a result of changing habits. It is hoped that cocoa sales will get a boost this year as the Co-op becomes the first UK retailer to switch to selling and using only Fairtrade cocoa in all its own-brand chocolate products, from the sprinkles on its doughnuts to chips in its triple chocolate cookies. The switch to 100% Fairtrade cocoa, covering over 200 individual Co-op products, will be completed by the end of May. It will lead to a five-fold rise in the amount of Fairtrade cocoa sourced by the retailer, taking the total tonnage from 526 to 2,848 tonnes. Brad Hill, Fairtrade strategy manager at the Co-op, said: \u201cWhen we consider that demand for cocoa is set to rise by 30% over the next three years alone, it is imperative that we keep moving forward with sustainability initiatives in order to shape this industry.\u201d In 2014, sales of Fairtrade goods in the UK fell for the first time since the ethical trading scheme was founded more than 20 years ago, as cash-strapped consumers held back spending. In 2015 sales slid to \u00a31.6bn from \u00a31.7bn as sales of sugar collapsed by over a third as a result of changes in EU market regulations.",

It will lead to a five-fold rise in the amount of Fairtrade cocoa sourced by the retailer, taking the total tonnage from 526 to 2,848 tonnes. </p> <p>Brad Hill, Fairtrade strategy manager at the Co-op, said: \u201cWhen we consider that demand for cocoa is set to rise by 30% over the next three years alone, it is imperative that we keep moving forward with sustainability initiatives in order to shape this industry.\u201d </p> <p>In 2014, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/feb/23/fairtrade-sales-fall-first-time-20-year-existence\">sales of Fairtrade goods in the UK fell for the first time</a> since the ethical trading scheme was founded more than 20 years ago, as cash-strapped consumers held back spending. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/29/fairtrade-sugar-blues-bring-down-ethical-schemes-total-sales\">In 2015 sales slid to \u00a31.6bn from \u00a31.7bn as sales of sugar collapsed</a> by over a third as a result of changes in EU market regulations.</p>",
