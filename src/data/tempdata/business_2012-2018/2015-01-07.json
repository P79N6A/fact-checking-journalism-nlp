      "bodyText": "Put yourself in the shoes of Jens Weidmann, president of the German Bundesbank and chief critic of a policy of quantitative easing (QE) for the eurozone. Now that prices are falling in euro-land for the first time since the financial crisis, are there are any credible reasons to continue to resist a programme of bond-buying by the European Central Bank (ECB)? Well, Weidmann could start by pointing out the eurozone already enjoys two of the supposed benefits of QE \u2013 low yields on long-term government bonds and a weak currency. Even Italy can borrow at 2% for 10 years and the euro stands at a nine-year low against the dollar. Weidmann might also argue that, while headline inflation was minus 0.2% in December, \u201ccore\u201d inflation inched up to 0.8%. Why not wait awhile to see if lower energy prices, which puts euros in the pockets of consumers and manufacturers, boost spirits and spark growth? After all, that\u2019s what lower oil prices usually deliver. Isn\u2019t QE, by contrast, a step into the unknown? None of these arguments are convincing. The eurozone has just completed another year of miserable growth (0.8% is the ECB\u2019s own forecast) and little improvement is on the cards this year (1%, say the same forecasts). The danger of doing nothing is that it becomes harder to get out of the rut. It is true that nobody really knows how the QE medicine works but two of three countries that took a large gulp \u2013 the US and the UK \u2013 at least produced growth figures worthy of the name. The eurozone, by contrast, has stagnated. Deflation, whatever its immediate cause, may choke even more demand. The best argument for QE, though, is the one that Weidmann might regard as the flakiest: the financial markets expect it. Nobody wants to be a slave to the bond markets, of course, but Mario Draghi, president of the ECB, has spent the past year dropping ever-heavier hints that he is in favour of pure QE. If the boss can\u2019t get his way when deflation has actually arrived, investors will conclude that the ECB is simply dysfunctional. Sainsbury\u2019s in a trench The first world war advert was a crass way to flog groceries, but Sainsbury\u2019s did OK at Christmas. Like-for-like sales were down 1.7% in the 14 weeks to 3 January \u2013 not great, but better than most City predictions. On this measure of performance, Sainsbury\u2019s probably beat quoted rivals Tesco and Morrisons. Why the sullen share price reaction? The shares, after rising at the off, became one of few fallers in the FTSE 100 index. The answer is that minus 1.7%, to be followed by a predicted minus 2% in the fourth quarter, is a weak branch for shareholders to cling to. The worry is that Tesco is about to spoil everything with deep price cuts \u2013 starting on Thursday \u2013 that rivals will be obliged to match. Sainsbury\u2019s top brass tend to resent the suggestion that their fate lies in Tesco\u2019s hands. Look, they argue, we\u2019ve been competing successfully with Tesco for years; our prices are the sharpest they\u2019ve ever been and are currently lower than theirs; in short, we\u2019re know what we\u2019re doing. These are reasonable boasts. But the oldest rule in the supermarket book \u2013 especially true in deflationary times \u2013 is that not all the big chains can succeed at the same time. Tesco, humiliated over the past year and now under new boss Dave Lewis, will look to invigorate its UK business by pinching sales from elsewhere. On the assumption that Asda can look after itself, the finger is pointing at Sainsbury\u2019s. Lewis\u2019s grand plan may yet turn out to be a remix of predecessor Phil Clarke\u2019s puff and wind. He is constrained by Tesco\u2019s white-elephant hypermarkets and a balance sheet that looks dangerously over-stretched. If Tesco\u2019s price cuts are more headline-grabbing than deep, Sainsbury\u2019s has a good chance of muddling through with only modest profit declines. But Lewis, surely, understands that fiddling will impress neither Tesco\u2019s customers nor its shareholders. Sainsbury\u2019s investors are right to worry: their company is clearly capable of competing with a more aggressive Tesco, but the medium-term damage to profits is anybody\u2019s guess at this stage. No tears for boohoo No tears should be shed for investors in boohoo.com: an instant halving of the share price is what can happen when you buy shares in online fashion wannabes at sky-high valuations. The reasons given for Wednesday\u2019sprofit warning were mundane: autumn was mild and competitors were active. In other words, online clothes retailers suffer the same pressures as their high-street brethren. This should not be a surprise.",

Well-placed sources said that the 900,000 sq ft warehouse, which opened 18 months ago, could be processing a third fewer items than it had expected to be handling by this time. The shortfall is a result of communications problems between the various systems that handle products within the Castle Doningtoncomplex, compounded by record sales online. M&amp;S had to implement contingency plans, storing dozens of container-loads of goods at a separate warehouse over the peak season. It was also forced to set aside plans to distribute goods destined for stores from the facility to ensure the delivery of online orders, according to the sources. The retailer said it was able to meet all its promised delivery services and was handling all its online orders at Castle Donington. It insisted that its contingency plans for peak periods always included additional warehouse space. A spokesperson said: \u201cOur next-day delivery service is currently available and has been since before Christmas. Following our first full peak period at Castle Donington, we continue to optimise the facility.\u201d M&amp;S was deluged with complaints from shoppers before Christmas after it was forced to delay deliveries of online orders by up to two weeks and withdraw next-day delivery services to stores as Castle Donington struggled to cope with the volume of orders placed over the Black Friday promotional weekend. This week, a small number of shoppers continued to express disappointment on social media, with several saying orders had been belatedly cancelled because stocks were found to be unavailable days after their orders were confirmed. Analysts are expecting the problems at M&amp;S\u2019s warehouse to hit performance at the retailer.

      "bodyText": "OK, time to wrap up. A reminder of the main story: The European Central Bank (ECB) is expected to come under intense pressure to boost the supply of cheap credit to the eurozone after figures showed a much-feared period of deflation started in December, triggered by falling oil prices. A flash estimate of inflation found that a dramatic fall in fuel costs following the halving of oil prices dragged prices down by 0.2%. Separate data for unemployment in the eurozone turned the screw on the ECB board after the figure rose by 34,000 to maintain the unemployment rate at 11.5%. One analyst described the figures as dire news that would put strong pressure on the ECB to \u201cpull the quantitative easing (QE) trigger\u201d at its next meeting later this month. See here for more: Eurozone deflation puts pressure on ECB to launch QE stimulus The euro continues to hit new nine-year lows, now at $1.1805 to the US dollar. Europe\u2019s stock markets have gained ground as investors anticipate fresh easy money. The FTSeurofirst index provisionally closed 0.4% higher. David Madden, market analyst at IG, says: Volatility is high as equity traders cheered the dismal inflation figures from the eurozone. The struggling southern European nations are dragging down their northern counterparts, and when you add crumbling commodity prices into the mix the result is deflation. Mario Draghi will find it very difficult to deny the eurozone is suffering from a fall in the cost of living at the ECB meeting later this month, and this could force him to fire up the printing press. Trader still can\u2019t shake the looming political uncertainty in Greece but for now they are content to ride the QE gravy train. And after a volatile day, the oil price is heading down again tonight -- Brent crude is changing hands at $50.52 per barrel, a fall of 1.1%. Goodnight. GW Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, sums up the day: The Eurozone officially fell into deflation on Wednesday but European markets were unperturbed, taking the data to mean improved chances of the European Central Bank introducing an asset price-boosting quantitative easing program. Oil prices crashed below $50 but subsequently recovered as investors stepped in to try and pick the bottom at the big psychological round number. A hoax rumoured death of Saudi Arabia\u2019s King Abdullah helped create initial spike in demand for oil around the $50 per barrel level. European consumer prices were shown to fall -0.2% in December, worse than the -0.1% expected. The fact that we\u2019ve moved from the threat of deflation to actual deflation gives Mario Draghi more firepower to push through quantitative easing. Draghi\u2019s policy throughout has been to offer the possibility of QE should the data warrant it. The ECB head was surely hoping the data would never justify QE, but with this latest reading, it has. The euro continues to fall to new nine-year lows, amid speculation that the ECB will agree a QE bond-buying programme soon. It\u2019s now lost 0.65% against the US dollar today, to $1.1809. Kerry Craig, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, questions whether QE would do much good: \u201cThe Eurozone\u2019s move into deflation territory today was widely expected and reinforced expectations the ECB will announce sovereign bond buying on 22 January. However, whether this kind of US-style \u201cquantitative easing\u201d can have a major effect on the flow of credit in the Eurozone remains open to debate. Nevertheless, talk of QE has certainly had a major effect on the exchange rate, with the Euro hitting a nine year low.\u201d US shares are following Europe\u2019s lead by rising at the start of trading in New York. After five days of falls, the Dow Jones has risen by 124 points, or 0.7%, to 17496. The main European markets are all up around 1.2%. Our economics editor, Larry Elliott, writes that the slide in the oil price should be welcomed, and ought to deliver stronger growth over time: What\u2019s happened in the past six months or so is more of a supply shock. Sure, there has been a slight easing in global demand for crude caused by the slowdown in China and the stagnation in the eurozone. But this has been nothing like as dramatic as the collapse in activity during the winter of 2008-09. Instead, falling oil prices are more to do with over-supply from three big sources. The first has been the expansion of shale production in the US, the big structural change to the market since the financial crisis. The second has been the decision by Saudi Arabia to flood the market with cheap crude, thus forestalling any attempts by Opec to put a floor under the price by limiting output. The third has been increased production from countries \u2013 such as Russia \u2013 which are trying to protect their oil revenues as prices fall. Consumers are already feeling the benefits of this positive supply shock through cheaper petrol and rising real incomes. This will eventually feed through into stronger growth, which in turn will put a floor under the oil price. Crude may edge lower over the coming weeks, but it is unlikely to go much lower. Here\u2019s the full piece: Oil price plunge should raise real incomes and boost growth America\u2019s trade figures should continue to benefit from the fall in the oil price, says Capital Economics\u2019 Paul Dales: The more recent drop in oil prices will soon reduce the trade deficit by a further $5bn or so, to take it to a five-year low of $34bn. The slide in the oil price has helped America narrow its trade gap. The US trade deficit hit an 11-month low of $39bn in November, compared to estimates of $42bn. Petroleum imports fell to their lowest value in around 20 years, helping to cut overall imports by around 2.2%. Exports declined by 1.0%. Encouraging news from America -- US private firms created 241,000 new jobs in December, around 15,000 more than expected. November\u2019s private sector payroll figures were also revised higher, to show 227,000 new jobs were created, up from 208,000 previously. It suggests America\u2019s labor force ended 2014 quite robustly. The wider Non-Farm Payroll, measuring employment across the US economy, is released on Friday. Investors continue to push down the value of Greece\u2019s government bonds, ahead of its general election on 25 January. The interest rate, or yield, on Greek 10-year debt has risen to 10.7%, up from 9.6% last night. Greece\u2019s deputy premier, Evangelos Venizelos, has warned today that the country is in a race against time to form a new government and cannot afford to have inconclusive elections. Athens correspondent Helena Smith reports: \u201cWe cannot go to a second round of elections,\u201d said the socialist leader addressing the issue of a second vote taking place the following month if Greeks fail to elect a government on January 25. \u201cIf we waste February, too, the train will have derailed,\u201d Venizelos told Skai TV insisting that Athens faced an excruciatingly tight deadline to conclude negotiations with creditors and draft a precautionary credit line to replace the bailout funds that formally ended last year. \u201cThe memorandum ended on 31st December and with it the loans,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is nothing else. They have kept the last instalment of \u20ac1.8bn euro, there is only [help from] the IMF which is small.\u201d The radical left Syriza party is leading polls, but if it doesn\u2019t achieve an outright majority then Greece could face protracted negotiations to form a coalition government. Time for a recap. Pressure on the European Central Bank has intensified after the eurozone\u2019s inflation rate turned negative for the first time since 2009. Consumer prices fell by 0.2% year-on-year in December, raising fears that the single currency region will enter a prolonged period of deflation. However, core inflation inched up to 0.8% annually, Eurostat reported. The fall in the oil price dragged the inflation rate down \u2013 energy prices have shrunk by 6.3% over the last year. Food prices were flat. Several economists reckon the ECB will announce some form of new QE programme later this month; European stock markets have rallied this morning. But Jonathan Loynes, chief economist at Capital Economics, reckons the ECB has waited too long: \u201cToday\u2019s figures pile yet more pressure onto the ECB to deliver a sizeable quantitative easing programme at its policy meeting later this month. But it\u2019s too late to head off deflation now,\u201d said \u201cWithout a rebound in oil prices, energy effects alone could push the headline inflation rate down towards -1 percent in the early months of this year and keep it in negative territory for most of 2015.\u201d Full reaction starts here. The oil price has weakened today, sending Brent crude down to a new 5 1/2-year low of $49.66 per barrel this morning. The eurozone\u2019s unemployment rate remains unchanged, at 11.5% in November. But the difference between its largest members is stark \u2013 Germany\u2019s jobless rate has hit a record low of 6.5%, while Italy\u2019s rate is at a record high of 13.4%. Germany has led the opposition to a full-blown eurozone QE programme, arguing that buying up government bonds with new money would be ineffective and illegal. But Nick Beecroft, senior market analyst at Saxo Capital Markets, reckons the Bundesbank may now cave in at the next ECB meeting: \u201cThe news that the estimate for December Eurozone headline inflation fell to -0.2% yoy will surely set the seal on the ECB\u2019s much anticipated introduction of Quantitative Easing and could serve to silence, or at the very least mollify, likely Governing Council dissenters, i.e. the Bundesbank. Very significantly, the descent into deflation was not due only to the recent precipitous decline in energy prices; food, alcohol and tobacco inflation also fell from 0.5% yoy to zero, yoy. Although there is obviously a big energy input component into those prices, there is also a large Euro area labour price input into local food production, and the fall in these CPI components should add great weight to voices calling for full-blown QE to be announced on January 22nd, and of an appropriate size, i.e. at least \u20ac500bn for two years, with mutualized risk.\u201d Danae Kyriakopoulou, economist at the Centre for Economics and Business Research, also argues that the European Central Bank may feel that the current deflation is the \u2018good\u2019 variety. Given that the ECB has for so long resisted QE even while some countries were in \u201cbad\u201d deflation, there may be little hope in expecting action now that deflation has spread to the rest of the bloc due to factors beyond its control. Overall, Cebr would welcome a move to QE but maintains its view that it would be insufficient to kick-start the recovery. A softer take on austerity and the setting of both fiscal and monetary policies in expansionary mode are imperative to avoid another crisis. The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Richard Barley is also in the \u2018low inflation is good\u2019 camp. Back to the eurozone\u2019s lurch into negative inflation (-0.2% in December). Samy Chaar, chief economist at Swiss bank Lombard Odier, argues that Europe is experiencing \u2018good\u2019 deflation, thanks to the falling energy prices Though prices contracted by 0.2% in December, core prices (excluding energy, food, alcohol and tobacco) remain stable at 0.8% (slightly increasing by +0.1%). The figures indicating prices fell are skewed because of the low oil price, which means there is slightly less pressure. Nonetheless, this forces the hand of the ECB and the data still makes the case for Draghi to act because of recent signals, market expectations, and the Greek saga. Quantitative easing might stabilise inflation expectations \u2013the key driver of inflation \u2013 but the central problem is one of liquidity. Overall, what we have is good disinflation and it will be interesting to see how much this will add to the pressure on the ECB to introduce full-blow QE when it meets on January 22nd.\u201d Ah.... it appears that a false rumour that Saudi Arabia\u2019s King Abdullah had died also pushed up the oil price in the last hour: Europe\u2019s stock markets are now rallying, on speculation that the ECB will announce a new stimulus programme soon. The FTSE 100, German DAX and French CAC indices are all up around 1.1%. And even the oil price is recovering -- Brent crude, which hit $49.66 per barrel this morning (a near six-year low), is back up around $51.60 now. There is no improvement in Europe\u2019s jobless crisis. The eurozone unemployment rate was unchanged in November 2014 at 11.5%. As usual, the lowest unemployment rates were recorded in Austria (4.9%) and Germany (5.0%), and the highest in Greece (25.7% for September 2014) and Spain (23.9%). More details here. Nick Kounis, economist at ABN Amro, predicts that eurozone inflation will remain negative for several months: We expect headline inflation to remain negative over the next few months. The exact path depends crucially on oil prices. If they were to remain at current levels, inflation would likely remain negative until June of this year. Having said that, core inflation is likely to move sideways. Despite high unemployment, there is little disinflationary pressure coming from the labour market. In addition, import prices (outside of oil) will rise due to the fall in the euro. And this could help European Central Bank president Mario Draghi to win enough support for a new quantitative easing programme, despite opposition from Germany. Kounis says: The Greek issue could complicate the announcement. We expect the ECB to announce that it will embark on a large scale asset purchase programme, including sovereign bonds, at its January meeting. However, it may well hold off from providing any further details until March, giving it a chance to see how the situation in Greece turns out. Economists can get into quite a lather arguing about what, exactly, counts as deflation. Back in 2008, ECB board member Lorenzo Bini Smaghi argued that prices would have to be falling for some time before an economy was truly in the grip of deflation (speech here). So you could argue that we\u2019re only seeing disinflation right now...... The euro is weakening, down 0.33% today to a new nine-year low of $1.1846 against the US dollar. Jeremy Cook, chief economist at the international payments company, World First, argues that oil cannot take all the blame for Europe\u2019s slide into negative inflation. The European Central Bank must take some of the blame, he says: \u201cYou will only need one guess as to what represents the biggest nail in the European inflationary coffin. \u201cA 6.3% fall in oil price inflation in the year to December has put year-on-year prices into negative territory for the first time since 2009 in the Eurozone. \u201cAlthough oil is a convenient scapegoat for those policymakers that believe that the weakness in prices is \u2018transitory\u2019, the lack of willingness on the part of ECB policymakers to actively engage in a scheme to help promote demand in the euro area is the ultimate harvest that has been reaped. \u201cThis has not increased the chances of a European Central Bank QE scheme; that much has already been made clear to be on its way in my opinion. \u201cWhat today\u2019s number has done is show the alarming lack of foresight that the ECB has exercised once again, and how close to the fire the European economy remains.\u201d Here\u2019s some of the best instant comment on the news that the eurozone inflation rate has turned negative: One important point \u2013 core inflation across the eurozone rose in December, to +0.8%. Core inflation strips out volatile measures such as food and energy prices, so central bankers see it as a better measure of underlying inflationary pressures. But it\u2019s still a long way below the European Central Bank\u2019s target of inflation close to, but below, 2%. The drop in eurozone inflation is due to the slump in the oil price -- as this chart from Eurostat shows: BREAKING: The eurozone has fallen into deflation. Harmonised consumer prices across the single currency region fell by 0.2% annually in December, according to Eurostat. That\u2019s a bigger fall than expected, and surely raises the pressure on the European Central Bank to take fresh stimulus measures. Perhaps as early as this month\u2019s meeting? Details and reaction to follow! Just a few minutes to go until the eurozone inflation data, and jobless rate, is released. Economists expect to see the consumer prices index fall into negative territory, at minus -0.1% year on year. Michael Fuchs, a senior member of Angela Merkel\u2019s party, has reportedly blamed Italy\u2019s dire unemployment rate on its failure to reform its economy. Here are the newswire snaps: Consumer group uSwitch has urged utility firms to feed the slump in energy prices onto their customers, and criticised the industry for not acting faster. Tom Lyon, uSwitch.com energy expert, says: \u201cIt\u2019s only right that consumers should benefit from lower wholesale energy costs. Whilst quick to pass on rising costs, the big six energy suppliers are yet to reduce bills for the majority of their customers who are on standard tariffs. \u201cIt\u2019s now high time for one of the big six to cut their standard prices and help hard-pressed households, and lay down the gauntlet to the others to do the same. \u201cWith the average bill now an eye-watering \u00a31,265 \u2013 168% higher than a decade ago \u2013 it\u2019s little wonder that energy costs top consumers\u2019 concerns. The best advice for those worried about energy bills is to shop around, as our experience shows that on average most people who do can save over \u00a3220 a year.\u201d A reminder of the struggle faced by young people in Italy looking for work: Brent crude oil has inched back over the $50 per barrel mark, but is still down 1.6% today. If Dickens was writing the story of Europe\u2019s economic plight, he might reprise A Tale of Two Cities \u2013 Berlin and Rome. Data just released shows that Germany and Italy\u2019s fortunes continue to diverge, and workers are feeling the impact. The German unemployment rate has fallen to a record low of just 6.5% in December, as Europe\u2019s largest economy continues to shrug off the worst of the eurozone crisis. It\u2019s the lowest rate since reunification in 1990; the jobless total fell by 27,000 last month, to 2.841m. But over in Italy, it\u2019s a bleaker situation. The Italian jobless rate hit a record high at 13.4% in November, highlighting its economic plight (Italy is currently in recession, and has been either contracting or stagnating for the last three years). The youth unemployment rate rose again, to 43.9%. These charts show the two country\u2019s unemployment rates over the last decade: Reminder, the latest eurozone unemployment and inflation (or deflation?) data is released at 10am GMT. In the City, the slide in the oil price is hurting the energy sector. Weir Group, the Glasgow-based engineering firm which serves the industry, is leading the FTSE 100 fallers, down 1%. Exploration firms Tullow Oil and BG Group are both down 0.8%. The FTSE 100 is up 38 points, after falling on Monday and Tuesday. Supermarkets and retailers are leading the risers, after Sainsbury beat forecasts over Christmas. Sainsbury\u2019s enjoys better Christmas than expected despite sales fall UK motorists should hopefully see the benefits of the lower oil price on the forecourt soon. Although, as consumer journalist Paul Lewis points out, only a small proportion of the petrol price actually pays for the hydrocarbons. Yesterday, Ladbrokes said petrol is odds-on (1/2) to fall below 100p/litre this month. US crude oil is also being driven lower -- down another 1.5% below the $47/barrel mark. The speed of the slump in the oil price mirrors the selloff in autumn 2008, when Brent fell from around $100/barrel to just $36/barrel after the collapse of Lehman Brothers. As mentioned at 7.28am, oversupply and weak demand are both being blamed. Here\u2019s Reuters\u2019 explanation: The low prices are a result of high output clashing with sluggish demand, especially in Europe, which is still struggling with its debt crisis, and in Asia, where China\u2019s growth is slowing and Japan is battling recession. On the demand side, output from North American shale producers remains high, although drilling is slowing, and producer club OPEC has so far resisted calls to cut production in support of prices. Instead, it is trying to defend its market share through offering low price The slump in the oil price is undoubtedly good news for the global economy, argues Boris Johnson\u2019s economic advisor, Dr Gerald Lyons: Brent Crude has just fallen below the $50/barrel mark for the first time in five and a half-years. The benchmark oil price has shed another 2% this morning, as the oil price continues to be pushed down by global economic growth fears and excess supplies. Economists suggest oil has further to fall too. Nobuyuki Nakahara, a former oil executive and ex-member of the Bank of Japan\u2019s policy board, told Reuters: \u201cI would not be surprised if the price falls to as low as around $20... It is purely due to supply and demand. There is a ceiling for oil because high energy prices dampen economic growth.\u201d The weak oil price puts more pressure on utility firms, airlines and petrol suppliers to pass savings onto customers -- as chancellor George Osborne tweeted last night. As we reported last night, the cost of living will be a big issue in May\u2019s general election: George Osborne fires warning shot over tumbling oil prices The fall in the oil price is hurting Russia\u2019s currency -- the rouble has lost another 0.5% this morning to 63.5 roubles to the US dollar. Brent crude oil is weakening further, and is now just a few cents above $50/barrel. This chart shows how the cost of Brent crude has halved since last summer, down to the brink of $50. Today\u2019s selloff means Brent crude could fall below $50 today, suggests Bloomberg\u2019s Andrew Barden: The oil price has continued to fall overnight, pushing Brent crude down towards the $50 mark for the first time since the last global downturn in 2009. Brent has shed another 1.6% so far today, or $0.87 per barrel, to just $50.22. That\u2019s a new five and a half-year low. Brent has now shed more than 50% of its value since the summer \u2013 six months ago, it was changing hands for $110 per barrel. US crude is down again too today, at $47.21 per barrel. Oil has been sliding for months, especially since the OPEC cartel refused to cut production in November despite signs of a supply glut. Weak economic data has also pushed the price down -- surveys released yesterday showed a slowdown in service sector growth in the US and UK, and parts of Europe. The weak oil price is likely to push inflation rates lower across the globe, raising the chance that the eurozone will fall into deflation. And while it should be good news for consumers, it means more economic pain for oil producers who will be struggling to break even at the current prices: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of events across the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Today could be D-Day for Europe\u2019s struggling economy. D for Deflation, that is. The latest consumer price index data is released at 10am GMT, and economists believe it will show that harmonised inflation across the euro area fell by 0.1% over the last year. Prices have been dragged down by falling oil and cost-cutting from Europe\u2019s struggling firms. That would surely heighten calls for the European Central Bank to take fresh action to stimulate Europe\u2019s economy, but might not sway hawkish members of the ECB. Core inflation (stripping out volatile items like energy and fuel) is expected to remain at 0.7%. We also get the latest eurozone unemployment data at 10am GMT, and it\u2019s likely to confirm that Europe\u2019s labour markets remain tough. Italy\u2019s unemployment rate could hit a new record high of 13.3%, keeping the eurozone-wide rate at 11.5%. What else is afoot? Investors will be watching events in Greece, as the general election campaign heats up. Overnight, the left-wing Syriza party had promised to crack down on the country\u2019s wealthiest businesspeople, as the FT reports: The oligarchs are high on our agenda,\u201d George Stathakis, the shadow development minister and Syriza\u2019s senior economic spokesperson said in an interview with the Financial Times. \u201cThey will be a priority for action.\u201d Could be a popular move with the electorate.... And in the City, supermarket chain Sainsbury\u2019s is revealing how it fared over Christmas, in one of the toughest festive periods in decades. Like-for like sales fell by 1.7% in the six-weeks around Christmas (if you ignore petrol) -- not as bad as expected, but not great either. I\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day....",

Sure, there has been a slight easing in global demand for crude caused by the slowdown in China and the stagnation in the eurozone. But this has been nothing like as dramatic as the collapse in activity during the winter of 2008-09. Instead, falling oil prices are more to do with over-supply from three big sources. </p> <p>The first has been the expansion of shale production in the US, the big structural change to the market since the financial crisis. The second has been the decision by Saudi Arabia to flood the market with cheap crude, thus forestalling any attempts by Opec to put a floor under the price by limiting output. The third has been increased production from countries \u2013 such as Russia \u2013 which are trying to protect their oil revenues as prices fall.</p> <p>Consumers are already feeling the benefits of this positive supply shock through cheaper petrol and rising real incomes. This will eventually feed through into stronger growth, which in turn will put a floor under the oil price.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s biggest housebuilding firm has stepped up its recruitment of former military personnel as bricklayers and joiners and called on the rest of the industry to follow suit to combat severe skill shortages. Between 12,000 and 15,000 people leave the armed services each year. Persimmon\u2019s chief executive, Jeff Fairburn, believes they are a talent pool the housebuilding industry should tap into. \u201cThose individuals are very keen to learn. It\u2019s a skill for life,\u201d he said. Persimmon has already taken on 100 former military personnel to train primarily in bricklaying, where the lack of skilled workers has reached a record high, according to the latest construction survey from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. Persimmon wants to increase that number to 500 a year, alongside the 100 school-leavers it takes on as apprentices annually. The ex-services recruits can be trained in 12 months to two years, whereas traditional apprenticeships for school-leavers can take three years or more. Persimmon hopes to have a new training centre in south-east England up and running by April and intends to open another one in the Midlands. The latest spurt in housebuilding has led to deepening shortages of skilled workers, after 400,000 people were laid off during the recession. Many went overseas or switched to different jobs such as driving taxis. Increasing workloads mean 200,000 construction jobs will need to be filled over the next five years, according to the Construction Industry Training Board. On top of this, 400,000 workers are expected to retire in the next five to 10 years. Brian Berry, head of the Federation of Master Builders (FMB), said the industry faced a \u201cskills timebomb\u201d. The FMB will pilot an adult training scheme with Gateshead college, near Newcastle upon Tyne, starting in March, where 15-20 former military and unemployed people will be retrained using funds from the Local Enterprise Partnership and the Skills Funding Agency. They will then be placed with small local construction firms. The FMB\u2019s services director, Steve Laurence, who drew up the scheme, said the first cohort would learn the basics of \u201call the biblical trades\u201d in one year \u2013 bricklaying, joinery, roofing, floorlaying, plastering and painting \u2013 and gain an NVQ level 2 qualification, with the opportunity to specialise after. He is in talks with other training providers in Hull and Leeds, but said the problem is that funding has to be negotiated each time at local level. \u201cThere is no pot of money nationally for this.\u201d The FMB is working with the Department for Work and Pensions on several initiatives. They include efforts to keep older construction workers involved. Many want to continue working well into their 60s and could work part-time, including mentoring young apprentices, or change to less arduous roles, the FMB said. Housebuilders have also brought in bricklayers from other European countries to plug gaps. \u201cThere is the possibility of doing a bit more in that regard,\u201d Fairburn said. Persimmon said it built 13,509 new homes last year, 17% more than in 2013. Annual revenues climbed 23% to \u00a32.6bn. Fairburn expects another good year, despite uncertainty about the outcome of the general election in May. Housebuyers tend to be cautious around election time. This is a \u201cslight concern\u201d, he said, but the market is underpinned by the recent cuts in stamp duty and an array of attractive mortgage products. BT has recruited more than 1,600 former servicemen and women as engineers to work on its fibre broadband rollout over the past three years.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Sainsbury\u2019s has suffered its worst Christmas in a decade with sales sliding by 1.7% \u2013 although the decline was smaller than the City had expected. Mike Coupe, the chief executive, warned the year ahead would be challenging as he revealed the supermarket group\u2019s fourth consecutive quarter of falling sales. It was, however, an improvement on the previous quarter\u2019s 2.8% drop. Over Christmas, food prices at Sainsbury\u2019s were down by 0.5-1%, accounting for about half the retailer\u2019s fall in sales for the quarter ending 3 January. Coupe said there was no sign of a pick-up in the grocery market despite the falling cost of fuel, which was handing families up to \u00a310 extra a week to spend. The volume of groceries sold at Sainsbury\u2019s remained level with 2013. \u201cCustomers have a little bit more money in their back pocket but they are choosing to spend that on other items,\u201d he said. Coupe suggested new cars were among a list of more pressing or tempting alternatives that also included transport costs and phones. The chief executive said the next three months would be \u201cchallenging with food price deflation likely to continue\u201d and underlying sales growth at Sainsbury\u2019s was likely to fall to about 2.1% in the first quarter of 2015. Coupe said the retailer would respond to any action by rivals such as Tesco, which is widely expected to announce more price cuts on Thursday. \u201cWhatever happens we will be matching our competitors toe-to-toe and we believe we have the financial capacity to do that.\u201d The retailer has promised to invest \u00a3150m in price cuts this year, and began that campaign with reductions on 700 items this week. But analysts expressed concern that Sainsbury\u2019s would face increasing pressure if Tesco cuts prices, with some predicting the UK\u2019s biggest retailer will invest \u00a3900m. Clive Black at Shore Capital said: \u201cIf Tesco does get its act together, then Sainsbury\u2019s may be particularly vulnerable.\u201d Bryan Roberts at Kantar Retail said: \u201cSainsbury\u2019s performance, against a deflationary zero growth backdrop, is by no means a horror show and is likely to position Sainsbury\u2019s as the second-best performer [after Asda] among the big four over the festive trading period. This year could be a challenge: lacking Tesco\u2019s buying power and Asda\u2019s efficiency, Sainsbury\u2019s margins are set to be under further pressure.\u201d Coupe suggested Sainsbury\u2019s was likely to have taken market share over Christmas with consumers shopping around for bargains, wasting less and using leftovers to save cash. \u201cCompanies like ourselves, which tend to represent quality, will broadly speaking have done better,\u201d he said. The retailer beat expectations as sales of its premium Taste the Difference label grew by 5% year on year, led by prosecco, up 30%. Sales of turkeys rose 8% while clothing sales were up 10% as the retailer sold almost twice as many Christmas jumpers as it did in 2013. In a reflection of changing shopping habits, Sainsbury\u2019s convenience stores experienced a 3% rise in underlying sales \u2013 stripping out the impact of new store openings. The Sainsbury\u2019s Local chain took \u00a38m on Christmas Eve alone, the chain\u2019s biggest-ever sales day. But the company admitted that its online business was likely to have performed less well than rivals, with sales up by just 6%. Finance director John Rogers insisted the lacklustre growth was not caused by delivery problems experienced by about 500 shoppers in the last few days before Christmas, but because Sainsbury\u2019s had avoided offering costly vouchers and discounts. Sainsbury\u2019s is the first of the large supermarket chains to reveal its Christmas trading, as the sector experiences one of its toughest festive seasons amid growing competition from discounters Aldi and Lidl and upmarket grocers Waitrose and Marks and Spencer. On Tuesday, Waitrose revealed a 2.8% rise in sales at established stores in the five weeks to 3 January. The discounters are expected to have enjoyed double-digit growth. Asked if Sainsbury\u2019s and the other major grocers were now fighting back against the discounters, whose pace of growth has been gradually slowing in recent months, Coupe said: \u201cI suspect we will see some form of equilibrium in the next 12 to 24 months. It is still going to be extremely challenging and I am not in a position to call the turn, but I do think that in the next period of time there will be a change in the market dynamic.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Brent crude was trading below $50 (\u00a333) a barrel for the first time since 2009 on Wednesday as the rout in global oil prices continued. The industry benchmark has slumped from $116 a barrel in June, driven by a glut in supply and shrinking demand owing to fears over the outlook for world economic growth. Brent was down by another 2% in trading on Wednesday, putting more pressure on the shares of FTSE 100 heavyweights BP and Royal Dutch Shell. James Hughes, chief market analyst at Alpari, said: \u201cMany will be asking just how much lower the oil price can go before some kind of stabilising effect kicks in. However, after every $10 fall experts have been calling the end of the slide but have seen it continue to drop like a stone. \u201cTraders will be looking for the $40 level now as a base for the oil price but after further comments from Saudi Arabia yesterday hinting of still no move to curb output, then no one would be surprised to sees us drop yet lower than that level. \u201cBreak-even prices and fracking costs have long been broken and it now almost seems we will keep going lower until the members of the Opec cartel literally can no longer afford a slip in prices.\u201d Shippers, airlines and motorists stand to gain from the fall. The Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, said last month that the side in oil prices was a \u201cnet positive development\u201d for the UK. George Osborne fired a warning shot at energy companies, fuel retailers and airlines on Tuesday, insisting they pass on the benefits of lower oil prices to their customers. With the cost of living expected to be a big election battleground, the Treasury is planning an investigation into why lower oil prices are not being passed on by companies and industries linked to oil. The chancellor tweeted on Tuesday: \u201cOil price was $53 [a barrel] last night \u2013 lowest in 5yrs. Vital this is passed on to families at petrol pumps, through utility bills and air fares.\u201d The move will be seen as an attempt to neutralise attacks from Labour, after its leader, Ed Miliband, took on energy companies last year with his pledge to freeze energy bills for 20 months if elected this May. Tom Lyon, uSwitch.com energy expert, said: \u201cWhilst quick to pass on rising costs, the big six energy suppliers are yet to reduce bills for the majority of their customers who are on standard tariffs. \u201cIt\u2019s now high time for one of the big six to cut their standard prices and help hard-pressed households, and lay down the gauntlet to the others to do the same. \u201cWith the average bill now an eye-watering \u00a31,265 \u2013 168% higher than a decade ago \u2013 it\u2019s little wonder that energy costs top consumers\u2019 concerns. The best advice for those worried about energy bills is to shop around, as our experience shows that on average most people who do can save over \u00a3220 a year.\u201d A combination of the US shale boom and weakness in the global economy \u2013with the eurozone stagnant and Chinese growth slowing \u2013 has resulted in supply outpacing demand. The oil price came under sustained pressure in November when, despite this, Opec ministers decided not to cut supply.",

The average cost of a home bought by a first-time buyer rose 9% to \u00a3171,870, compared with a year ago. However, the average cost of a deposit for this type of buyer fell 7% over the same period to \u00a329,218. Craig McKinlay, mortgages director at Halifax, said: \u201cImproving economic conditions and rising employment levels have boosted confidence among those thinking about getting on to the housing ladder for the first time, contributing to the significant increase in the number of first-time buyers in the past two years.\u201d Larne in Northern Ireland was the most affordable local authority area in the UK, with an average property price of \u00a380,793 for first-time buyers. The worst was Camden in London, where the average first-time buyer\u2019s property price of \u00a3614,315 was 11.4 times the gross average annual earnings in the area.",

      "bodyText": "The full extent of the Bank of England\u2019s emergency action to prevent the collapse of the banking system is revealed on Wednesday as it releases previously secret documents detailing its frantic day to day efforts to prop up high street banks during the financial crisis. Threadneedle Street adopted code names for the high street banks on its rescue list and discloses how close Alliance &amp; Leicester came to needing the financial support from the state that was later handed out to HBOS and Royal Bank of Scotland in 2008. Publishing documents after a four-year battle with the Treasury select committee, the Bank of England also reveals how ill-prepared it was for the worst financial collapse in modern history, with senior officials changing their minds about the effectiveness of the regulatory system in place as the crisis unfolded. The minutes of meetings of the Bank\u2019s court \u2013 akin to a board of directors \u2013 cover the period from the start of the financial crisis, when queues formed outside Northern Rock branches in September 2007, to the middle of 2009, by which time RBS had been bailed out and HBOS rescued by Lloyds TSB. They show that: \u2022 The court was kept in the dark about the scale of the problems at Northern Rock until the central bank was forced into mounting an emergency funding line. \u2022 The Bank congratulated itself on how well the tripartite system of regulation it shared with the Treasury and the Financial Services Authority worked even after the near collapse of Northern Rock. \u2022 An emergency committee of the court called Transco \u2013 set up after the Northern Rock crisis \u2013 met seven times in the fortnight leading to the bailout of the banking system in October 2008 and provided tens of billions of support to stop banks collapsing. \u2022 The Bank fully supported the increase in national debt sanctioned by the then Labour government to rescue the banks and considered the action to be no threat to the solvency of the UK. With the UK\u2019s persistent budget deficit already a key battle ground for the May 2015 election, the minutes provide support for Labour\u2019s argument that the deterioration in the public finances was justified by the need to rescue the banks. The minutes of a meeting held in February 2009 said: \u201cIt was suggested that much of the public commentary about the credit worthiness of the UK government was ill-informed. There was no doubt that the fiscal deficit would rise sharply \u2026 Although such a large increase would not be desirable in the long run, it was sensible to do that in the short term.\u201d The minutes are released under the guidance of the governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, who replaced Mervyn King, now Lord King, in July 2013. Carney said: \u201cThe financial crisis was a turning point in the bank\u2019s history. These minutes provide further insight into the Bank\u2019s actions during the exceptional period \u2013 the policies implemented to mitigate the crisis, the lessons that were learnt and how the Bank changed as a result.\u201d The Bank \u2013 whose powers have now been bolstered to take over regulation of the banking system \u2013 defended itself by saying that at the time it had no powers to tackle macro-prudential risk and was not responsible for banking supervision and that there was not resolution authority. The coalition tore up the tripartite system after taking power in 2010 and broke up the FSA. \u201cThe roles, in a crisis, of the Bank, the Treasury and the FSA were ill-defined,\u201d the Bank said. \u201cThese issues were rapidly identified during the period covered by the minutes.\u201d It said the situation had been rectified by the changes brought in by the coalition. But Andrew Tyrie, the chairman of the Treasury select committee, said the minutes showed how the Bank\u2019s executive team had reversed its position towards the tripartite system. \u201cAt the start of the Northern Rock crisis the court was told by the Bank executive (and by the then chairman of the FSA) how well it was working. Soon, though, it was told that tensions were evident. But before long the governor was telling the court that the tripartite arrangements were \u2018not sufficiently workable or relevant to managing a crisis\u2019.\u201d The banks in trouble were given code names. Alliance &amp; Leicester, eventually taken over by the UK arm of Spanish bank Santander, was known as Tiger; Bradford &amp; Bingley, part nationalised in September 2008, was Badger. RBS was dubbed Phoenix while Lloyds TSB was Lark to HBOS\u2019s Fox. Minutes from November 2007 show a \u00a33bn funding facility was discussed for Alliance &amp; Leicester. \u201cIt was reported that during the last three days discussions had been taking place with a potential UK banking suitor. In those circumstances it was suggested that there was a possibility that the Bank\u2019s swap facility might not be required,\u201d the minutes said. In October 2008, the minutes of the emergency Transco sub board discussing handing \u00a322bn of loans to HBOS, said: \u201cIn order for the government to make progress on a wider solution to the financial crisis, occupied with the problems of Fox on a daily basis. The Bank had informed HM Treasury who were content with the proposed actions.\u201d The minutes, Tyrie said, showed \u201cthe Bank appears to have been a very hierarchical organisation, with clear signs of \u2018groupthink\u2019 among its leadership\u201d. \u201cThe executive rarely acknowledged possible weaknesses in its views or, other than grudgingly, admitted that it might have been unprepared for the crisis,\u201d said Tyrie. \u201cThe court does not seem to have challenged the executive strongly. The non-executives acted on occasion more as cheerleaders for the executive\u2019s views, and accepted its policy priorities\". \u201cTaken as a whole, these minutes make the clearest possible case for radical reform of the Bank\u2019s governance and the need to address the manifest inadequacies of the archaic approach upon which the Bank were relying during the crisis,\u201d said Tyrie.",
