      "bodyText": "Donald Trump\u2019s most senior business representative has warned any post-Brexit deal with Washington will hinge on the UK scrapping rules set by Brussels, including regulations governing imports of chlorinated chicken. Wilbur Ross, the US commerce secretary, suggested European regulations governing the safety of imports such as chlorine-washed chicken ignored US scientific research. His comments underline the potential difficulties in striking a free trade deal with the US once Britain leaves the EU. The key Trump adviser, who was separately caught on Monday at the heart of the furore over the Paradise Papers, said changing these regulations will form a \u201ccritical component of any trade discussion,\u201d between London and Washington, while the UK should also take steps to remove \u201cunnecessary regulatory divergences\u201d with the US. Speaking in front of an audience of business leaders at the Confederation of British Industry annual conference in London on Monday, Ross warned any deal with Brussels to maintain its regulations might \u201chinder development of a closer post-Brexit US-UK relationship\u201d. He also said it was important for the UK\u2019s deal to leave the EU to take into account America\u2019s \u201ccommercial interests\u201d. He said that Trump was \u201cvery supportive\u201d of a trade deal between London and Washington. Ross said the UK would need to change rules in areas such as food safety, as well as take steps to bring the standards for the manufacturing of medical devices closer in line with the US. Criticising EU regulations, he referred to the \u201climited role of science\u201d in assessing risks related to certain foodstuffs, amid an ongoing row over safety of chlorinated chicken. Geographic indicators on food products, the registration and documentation of chemical exports, as well as automotive industry standards and trade tariffs are also \u201ckey impediments\u201d to expanded trade, he said. \u201cSomething we hope to be able to quickly fix between our two countries,\u201d he added. Ross\u2019s comments are likely to fuel concerns that controversial clauses will be attached to any post-Brexit trade deal with Washington. A political row was ignited in Westminster over the summer after Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, suggested the UK should be open to the prospect of allowing poultry treated with a chlorine wash process, which is banned by the EU, as part of a trade deal with the US. Fox defended the practice last week, despite assurances from Michael Gove, the food and environment secretary, that there were no circumstances under which chlorinated chicken would be allowed in the UK after the UK leaves the EU. Ross also bemoaned the lack of US involvement in the EU standard-setting process. These \u201chindrances... [are] potentially ones that the UK could help solve if you don\u2019t simply adopt EU trade policy in its entirety [after Brexit]\u201d, he added. Washington trade representatives and American industry experts are due to hold a second round of \u201cpreliminary scoping discussions\u201d in London next week, after the first meetings in Washington in July, he said. He added: \u201cAs the UK stands on the edge of the major changes coming with Brexit, we stand ready to use this opportunity to support our friends across the pond and to deepen our ties even further.\u201d The Department for International Trade said: \u201cThe US is our largest single trading partner, and the comments today from Wilbur Ross reaffirm the clear will on both sides of the Atlantic to strengthen our bilateral trade and investment relationship. \u201cAs an international economic department we are laying the groundwork for a potential free trade agreement and remain committed to a mutually beneficial economic trading arrangement with the US. We have been clear that the UK will maintain its own high regulatory standards in future free trade agreements.\u201d \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

      "bodyText": "And finally, here\u2019s a neat graphic summing up today\u2019s UK car sales figures: And on that note, it\u2019s time to wrap up. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW Brent crude has now hit a 28-month high, at almost $64 per barrel, as the shockwaves from the Saudi \u2018corruption crackdown\u2019 ripple through the oil market. The purge of Saudi princes and officials has sparked speculation that instability in Saudi Arabia could affect oil supplies in the future. Michael Loewen, a commodities strategist at Scotiabank in Toronto, explained to Bloomberg that: \u201cThe geopolitical supply risk premium is starting to bear its head in the market right now because OPEC supply cuts have made it relevant.\u201d Loewen added that, with supply capped and demand rising, potential risks to supply become more significant. The drop in UK car sales didn\u2019t deter City traders from pushing the Footsie to tonight\u2019s closing high. Energy firms rose, tracking the oil price after Brent crude hit that two-year high this morning. Mining firms also had a good day, thanks to a pickup in the copper price. Connor Campbell of Spreadex explains: Arguably, the UK index should have done better given the showing from its commodity stocks. BP and Shell jumped 0.8% and 1% respectively as Brent Crude crossed $62.50 for the first time in 2 years following an \u2018anti-corruption\u2019 blitz from Saudi Prince Mohammed bin Salman, with investors barrelling into the commodity as they weighed up the potentially destabilising effect this will have on the country\u2019s oil output. Copper also got a boost this Monday, surging 1.2% as the markets got to grips with the idea that the metal will see a sharp increase in demand as electric vehicles becomoe more popular. This in turn led the UK\u2019s miners higher, with Riot Tinto up 1.7%, Anglo American up 2% and BHP Billiton up 2.7%. After a quiet trading session, the UK\u2019s FTSE 100 index has nudged up to a new all-time closing high. The blue-chip index gained just two points today, having also hit a closing high on Friday. However, the picture is less rosy when you adjust for the weaker pound..... Here\u2019s our news story on the latest drop in UK car sales, for those just tuning in: New car sales have declined for the seventh month in a row, falling more than 12% in October as worsening confidence among consumers and businesses continues to dampen the market. The figures show that the car market is on course for its first annual decline since 2011 and will continue to fall next year before stabilising in 2019, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). The industry body said car registrations dropped 12.2% year-on-year to 158,192 last month \u2013 the second double-digit decline this year. It is an acceleration from the 9.3% fall in car sales in September, the first time the market had declined in September in six years. In April, sales plummeted 19.8% after an increase in vehicle excise duty. Diesel sales tumbled by nearly 30% last month after the scandal over rigging emissions tests and political rumblings over restrictions on diesel cars. Demand for electric and hybrid cars continued to rise, up by nearly 37% to 8,244, while petrol models posted a small increase of 2.7%. Mike Hawes, the SMMT chief executive, said: \u201cDeclining business and consumer confidence is undoubtedly affecting demand in the new car market, but this is being compounded by confusion over government policy on diesel. Consumers need urgent reassurance that the latest, low-emission diesel cars on sale will not face any bans, charges or other restrictions, anywhere in the UK.\u201d More here: Labour MP Chuka Umunna MP has warned that the drop in UK car sales shows that Brexit is hurting the economy. He says: \u201cThis is yet more evidence that the Brexit squeeze is already hitting working people and businesses alike. \u201cThe rise in inflation \u2013 directly caused by the Brexit vote \u2013 has forced up prices and interest rates, deterring people from buying big-ticket items like cars. \u201cThe British people were promised that leaving the EU would make us better off, when in truth it is hitting growth, raising prices, and squeezing family budgets. Voters have the right to keep an open mind about our future when they see that the darkening reality is so far away from the Government\u2019s sunny rhetoric.\u201d The US stock market has opened for trading after a silence for the victims of yesterday\u2019s Texas church shooting... ..... and the Nasdaq index has hit yet another record high. That\u2019s partly thanks to Broadcom\u2019s takeover bid for Qualcomm. Qualcomm\u2019s shares have jumped by over 4%, while Broadcom are up 2%. There are reports that Qualcomm will reject Broadcom\u2019s advances, which is pitched at a 28% premium to Friday\u2019s closing price. After hitting a two-year high this morning, Brent crude still up - and trading at $62.30 per barrel. Kathleen Brooks of City Index says the shake-up and crackdown in Saudi Arabia is the \u2018key driver\u2019 behind Brent\u2019s rally. Last week the Saudi Arabian oil minister said that he supported another Opec production cut, set to be announced when Opec next meets later this month. This weekend an anti-corruption drive by Prime Mohammad bin Salman has seen the arrest of the well-known champion of capitalism Prime Alwaleed bin Talal among other officials and has rattled investors, stock exchanges across the Middle East have fallen at the start of this week. However, this hasn\u2019t hurt the oil price as yet. The reason that Brent has rallied even when other Saudi-based assets have struggled, could be two-fold: the extension of the Opec production cut is a powerful driver of oil in the short term, and Brent could be acting as a safe haven in the midst of the confusion around the anti-corruption drive and Prime Mohammad bin Salman\u2019s shifting economic agenda. More here: Most European stock markets have lost a little ground today, as this chart shows: David Madden of CMC Markets blames profit taking, after stocks reached record highs last week: European equity markets are slightly in the red as traders lock in their profits from last week\u2019s broadly positive move. The DAX and the CAC 40 saw fresh record highs last week, while the FTSE 100 hit a multi-month high, so a small pullback today is hardly surprising. Over in America, the New York Federal Reserve has confirmed that its president, William Dudley, is retiring early next year. That means more upheaval at the US Federal Reserve, just a few days after Donald Trump announced that Jerome Powell will succeed Janet Yellen as Fed chair next year. The drop in the value of the pound since the 2016 EU referendum is an important factor in Britain\u2019s falling car sales. So argues Ana Nicholls, Automotive Analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit: It\u2019s not just a question of drooping consumer confidence - the economics of the car market have also changed in the past few months. With the pound so low, carmakers can no longer afford to use the kind of discounting and offers they have been using to keep the market buoyant. The diesel market, meanwhile, has been hit by the threat of regulation and higher levies in the wake of the emissions scandal. She adds that last week\u2019s interest rate rise (the first in a decade) will also dampen demand for new cars. The Bank of England\u2019s decision to raise interest rates won\u2019t help the market, either, given that 86% of all cars are bought on credit - many of them on personal contract plans. Total car loans now stand at nearly \u00a360bn. Although credit will remain cheap in historic terms, lenders will be forced to pass on the interest rate rise sooner or later. Sales of vans in the UK have also fallen sharply, mirroring the slump in car sales last month. The SMMT reports that light commercial vehicle sales fell by 7.4% last month; another sign that British businesses are suffering a drop in confidence. Sales of smaller vans (lighter than two tonnes) suffered a sharp decline, tumbling by 20% compared to October 2016 SMMT CEO Mike Hawes says \u201cpolitical and economic uncertainty\u201d has dented business confidence, discouraging firms from splashing out on a new vehicle. Newsflash from America: Semiconductor manufacturer Broadcom has launched a $130bn takeover bid to take control of smartphone chipmaker Qualcomm. If the deal goes though, it could be the biggest technology takeover ever, says the Financial Times. Both companies are major players in the market for wireless communications chips for mobile phones. Combining them would create the world\u2019s third-largest chipmaker, behind Intel and Samsung, according to Bloomberg. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is now addressing the CBI\u2019s annual conference. On Brexit, he says the UK needs to agree a transition deal soon. Delaying a transition deal until the final Brexit deal has been agreed is \u201csimply not good enough\u201d, says Corbyn (something BT\u2019s Gavin Patterson presumably agrees with). My colleague Andrew Sparrow is liveblogging the speech in his Politics Live blog: The chief executive of BT, Gavin Patterson, has warned the government that it only has a couple of months to agree a transitional Brexit deal, before firms start to vote with their feet. Patterson says companies will start enacting their \u201cworst case scenario\u201d Brexit plans from the start of next year, when the value of a transitional deal to leave the EU begins to \u201cdeteriorate\u201d for firms. Speaking at the CBI conference in London he says: \u201c[Clarity on transitional arrangements] That\u2019s very urgent at this moment. If we don\u2019t we\u2019ll all start planning and implementing a hard Brexit scenario which is not going to be very good.\u201d Asked when the value of a transitional deal becomes of less use, he said: \u201cThe beginning of next calendar year it\u2019s going to begin to deteriorate in value. Ultimately the planning horizon, of most businesses I certainly talk to, is the order of a year to 18 months. If you don\u2019t have certainty at that point you have to start planning for a worst case scenario.\u201d Over in the City, shares in car dealership Inchcape have fallen by 2.7% this morning, to the lowest level since mid-July. Traders seem to be reacting to this morning\u2019s weak UK car sales figures, say analysts at MorningStar: Simon Benson of AA Cars says the government\u2019s crackdown on older \u2018dirty diesel\u2019 cars is having a major impact - with sales down 30% year on year in October. Benson says: \u201cDespite registrations of alternatively fuelled vehicles rising and a slight uplift in sales of petrol cars, the overall market was down by more than 12% last month as these efforts failed to balance out diesel\u2019s sharp decline. \u201cWith the widespread uncertainty and general confusion surrounding diesels and the potential for charges and restrictions in London and other major cities, a distinct lack of buyer confidence is the primary reason for this dramatic drop. Back in July, the government outlined plans to ban new petrol and diesel cars and vans from 2040, as part of a crackdown on air pollution. Industry figures have hoped that consumers would move to Euro 6 diesels (which heat Europe\u2019s new, tougher emission standards). Today\u2019s data, though, suggests that many are shunning diesels, amid signs that the second-hand value of older diesels has slumped. Back in the eurozone, optimism among investors has hit its highest level in a decade. That\u2019s according to Sentix, the research group. It\u2019s eurozone investor confidence gauge soared to 34 this month, up from 29.7 in October . That\u2019s the best reading since July 2007 (just before the credit crunch struck). Sentix also found that investor sentiment towards Germany has hit an all-time high, following its strong growth this year (as highlighted by this morning\u2019s factory orders figures). Economist Danny Blanchflower reckons the decline in UK car sales shows that the Bank of England was wrong to raise UK interest rates last week. Alex Buttle of car buying comparison website Motorway.co.uk isn\u2019t surprised that diesel car sales have slumped by 30% year-on-year. He blames the emissions scandal, in which manufacturers used \u2018cheat software\u2019 to hide how much pollution they were creating. With Paris planning to ban diesels by 2024, consumers seem to be voting with their wallets. Buttle says: \u201cThese figures make depressing reading for the car industry. Petrol and alternative fuel figures were actually up in October, but diesel sales continue to flounder. \u201cDiesel\u2019s market share is plummeting and consumers aren\u2019t listening to rhetoric about cleaner diesel models, however much the industry drums on about it. The damage has been done. \u201cWhile it\u2019s understandable the SMMT is not deserting diesel and urging the government to act to reassure consumers that new diesel cars will be \u2018safe\u2019 from toxin tax punishment, is this a lost cause? Maybe it\u2019s time focus is shifted towards giving attractive tax incentives for purchasing alternative fuel vehicles to encourage growth in this area. \u201cConsumers are showing huge interest in eco-friendly cars and it\u2019s reflected in new registrations. AFVs are the future of the car industry and the government need to adapt to changing times if it has any interest in keeping the new car market buoyant.\u201d The outlook for UK car sales looks \u201cbleak\u201d, warns Samuel Tombs of Pantheon Economics. He says that the 12.2% slump in October is \u201calarming\u201d, and shows that consumers are very reluctant to make financial commitments at present. Last week\u2019s interest rate rise, from 0.25% to 0.5%, could also hurt demand, he fears. Tombs writes: Worryingly, sales are falling rapidly even though generous discounts are available for buyers trading in old, high-polluting diesel vehicles. Most manufacturers\u2019 diesel scrappage schemes are set to close at the end of this year. The recent further decline in consumer confidence, meanwhile, indicates that car registrations will continue to fall well into 2018. The downward trend likely will be amplified by increases in personal loan rates in response to last week\u2019s Bank Rate hike. Accordingly, the outlook for car sales looks bleak. This chart highlights how sharply UK car sales have declined this year: Tony Burke, assistant general secretary at the Unite union, blames the \u2018chaos\u2019 around Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union: The fall in UK car sales has accelerated over the last three months, making October\u2019s year-on-year decline the biggest since April: January: +2.9% February: -0.3% March: +8.4% April: -19.8% May: -8.5% June: -4.8% July: -9.3% August: -6.4% September: -9.3% October: - 12.2% (because of monthly fluctuations, UK car sales are compared to the same month a year ago). Although diesel sales slumped, Britons actually bought more electric cars in October. Sales of alternatively fuelled vehicles rose by 36.9% year-on-year, with 8,244 new models registered during the month. That pushed sales of AFV\u2019s through the 100,000 mark, up from around 75,000 a year ago. It\u2019s official! UK car sales declined by 12.2% in October, as the slowdown in Britain\u2019s auto industry continues. The Society for Motor Manufacturers and Traders blames \u201cfalling confidence among buyers\u201d, as the slump that began in April continues. Car sales to businesses shrank by 26.8%, suggesting that firms are cutting back on their spending. Sales to individual private buyers shrank by 10%, in a sign that customers are more cautious in the face of rising inflation and falling wages. Diesel sales took a particular hit, shrinking by almost 30%, while petrol sales rose a little. Here are the key points from today\u2019s sales figures: UK new car market declines again in October \u2013 down -12.2% to 158,192 units. Heavy losses for diesel as demand falls by almost a third, with -29.9% fewer registrations. Year to date registrations decrease -4.6%. This means that UK car sales have fallen by 4.6% in 2017, compared to 2016, with 2,224,603 cars registered since January. Mike Hawes, chief executive of the SMMT, wants the government to reassure people that diesel has a future: \u201cDeclining business and consumer confidence is undoubtedly affecting demand in the new car market but this is being compounded by confusion over government policy on diesel. Consumers need urgent reassurance that the latest, low emission diesel cars on sale will not face any bans, charges or other restrictions, anywhere in the UK. We urge the Government to use the forthcoming Autumn Budget to restore stability to the market, encouraging the purchase of the latest low emission vehicles as fleet renewal is the fastest and most effective way of addressing air quality concerns.\u201d Every weekday morning, Business Today delivers the biggest stories, smartest analysis and hottest topics direct to your inbox.

The French private sector grew at its fastest pace in over six years in October, according to data firm Markit\u2019s monthly healthcheck. Service sector firms and manufacturers both reported that activity was strong, pulling the French \u2018composite PMI\u2019 up to 57.4 (any reading over 50 shows growth). Germany companies also posted solid growth - although not quite as fast as in September. The German composite PMI dropped to 56.7, from 57.7. Italy, though, came off the boil, with the slowest rise in service sector growth since last autumn. The oil price has hit a two-year high this morning. Brent crude is changing hands at $62.50 per barrel, up 0.7%, which may lead to higher fuel and energy prices this winter. This follows the news that eleven Saudi princes have been arrested as part of a sweeping purge, which seems to strengthen crown prince Mohammed bin Salman. This is significant for the energy market, as prince Mohammed supports extending the current output curbs agreed by the Opec cartel. Edward Bell, an analyst at Emirates Nbd Bank Pjsc, explains (via Boomberg): \u201cAs one of the world\u2019s largest producers and exporters undergoes a transformation of its economy, some uncertainty and political risk is bound to be encountered along the way, which would be supportive for prices.\u201d Over in Europe, Germany\u2019s manufacturing sector has beaten expectations again. German factory orders rose by 1% in September, surprising economists who expected them to fall by 1.5%. This was driven by a jump in orders for capital goods - expensive machinery and equipment. August\u2019s already sparkling data has also been revised up, to show a 4.1% jump in orders - up from a previous estimate of 3.6%. It suggests that Europe\u2019s largest economy continues to grow strongly. 2017 is turning into the strongest year for the eurozone since the financial crisis struck. ING\u2019s Carsten Brzeski is impressed.... .. as is Fred Ducrozet of Pictet bank. Today\u2019s car sales figures come at a nervous time for the auto industry. Last month, car dealership chain Pendragon shocked the City with an unexpected profits warning which sent its shares careering to a four-year low. Car makers are also worrying about Brexit, as they currently benefit from Britain\u2019s membership of the single market and the customs union. Production across the industry has fallen for the last five months, with new investment on hold until there\u2019s more clarity over the UK\u2019s future. Vauxhall is already planning to swing the axe, with 400 jobs going at its site in Ellesmere Port, near Liverpool. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Britain\u2019s car industry has struggled in 2017, with sales falling steadily since April. New figures released today will show that the slump continued last month. Sales are expected to have fallen by around 12% year-on-year in October, following a 9% decline in September. Such a steep decline will surely fuel worries over the UK economy and consumer confidence. Diesel cars sales are likely to have tumbled particularly sharply, due to the fallout from the recent emissions scandal. The official figures are due at 9am, but preliminary data has already been released, as Reuters explains: British new car sales in October fell by about 12 percent year on year, marking a seventh consecutive month of decline, preliminary data released by an industry body showed on Monday. Sales were hurt by a decline in business and consumer confidence, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders(SMMT) said. Demand for diesel cars slumped by about 30 percent, the industry body said. The SMMT urged the government to use this month\u2019s autumn budget to restore stability to the market and encourage the purchase of the latest low emission vehicles. Also coming up today: Data firm Markit will release a new healthcheck on Europe\u2019s service companies. Growth probably held up well in October, with the headline PMI expected to remain at 54.9. European stock markets are expected to dip at the open, with the FTSE 100 called down 13 points from Friday night\u2019s record closing high. Plus, Britain\u2019s business chiefs are gathering in London for the CBI\u2019s annual conference. They\u2019ll hear from prime minister Theresa May and Labour\u2019s Jeremy Corbyn. Expect lots of talk about Brexit...

      "bodyText": "The latest retail trade figures show consumers are shutting their wallets. Retail spending has remained flat for two months in a row \u2013 the worst result since 2012. Weak wages growth clearly is having an ongoing effect. But the latest re-weighting of our spending habits by the Bureau of Statistics also shows us moving our spending away from retail towards a mixture of more expensive necessities such as rent, education and utilities, and areas that were cheaper than in the past such as restaurant meals and international holidays. We used to love to go shopping. From the start of 1990 through to the end of 2007, retail trade spending grew on average by 5.7% each year. The latest figures out last Friday showed that our spending grew by just 2.0% in trend terms in the past 12 months \u2013 the lowest ever recorded: So sluggish is retail spending that since 2009 there have only been two months where annual growth has reached the previous average level. The issue is twofold \u2013 the price of things is not rising by much and thus the turnover is not growing, and we are also not buying much in volume terms either. In September, the volume of retail trade was 2.2% above the same time last year \u2013 making it a rare case where the growth in the volume of retail trade was larger than the dollar amount: The reason is discount sales \u2013 people were buying more but not having to spend as much. Consider, for example, that in the past year the dollar amount spent at department stores fell but the volume of goods purchased increased 2.9%: And while volume of sales is good \u2013 when we talk of economic growth of GDP, for example, we always talk in volume terms \u2013 retail trade is more importantly about current dollars. More dollars mean more money for shop owners, more ability to hire new staff and is indicative that people are willing to spend more money and not just wait for the sales. One issue with retail trade is that because of changes in spending habits driven by costs of necessities and some non-retail luxuries such as holiday travel, Australians now spend less of their weekly budget on retail than they used to. One area where the growth in dollars spent outstripped volume was for restaurants, cafes and takeaways. And this is something that is reflected in the latest weighting of the consumer price index released on Monday. Every five to six years the ABS uses the latest housing expenditure survey to change how it calculates inflation, so as to reflect the changes households have made in their spending habits. Essentially, the CPI is worked out by trying to gauge what the average household spends its money on each week. Because it is an average, it is a weird type of household \u2013 for example, the ABS calculates that the average household spends money on both rent and buying a new home, as well as money on childcare, primary, secondary, and tertiary education, not to mention $41.51 a week on tobacco while also spending $15.60 on sports participation. What the latest weighting shows is that, on average, households are shifting away from retail. Of the top 15 items that have seen the biggest shift towards greater spending, only spending on restaurant meals and tobacco count as retail spending. In general terms, the biggest shift in our spending has been towards education, insurance and financial charges, and housing costs: The biggest change in housing costs is rent. In 2011, the ABS estimated the average Australian household spent 6.7% of its weekly spending on rent (remember because it is an average it includes households that don\u2019t actually pay rent). Now it is up to 7.2%. Oddly, despite the housing boom in the past five years, overall the ABS calculates the average household now spends less on buying a house. The reason is because while housing prices have increased, so too has our purchase of cheaper apartments. And thus, because more people are buying apartments now than in the past, the overall average of money being spent on buying a new home has decreased: The changes are not uniform across the nation. Adelaide has seen the biggest increase in money spent on rent and electricity. In 2011 the average Adelaide household spent $28.66 a week on electricity \u2013 a figure that has grown 54% to $44.10. Only Darwin households spend more each week on electricity. The amount spent on gas meanwhile has risen most in Sydney, Darwin and Canberra: It means that we now spend more of our budget on electricity, gas and rent than ever before, but because of the drop in petrol prices over the past five years, we now spend less of our money on that each week than we have in the past: But the big jump has been in childcare and education spending. Hobart households now spend on average 234% more on childcare than they did in 2011, while those in Perth spend 194% more on primary education: The reason for the increase in average childcare spending is due to an increase in demand \u2013 ie more households are using it \u2013 an increase in standards, so the average quality (and cost) has increased, and a general price rise due to the increased demand. In 2011, households across the country on average spent just 0.69% of their weekly budget on childcare \u2013 now that is up to 1.35%. It means increases in the cost of childcare will have a greater impact on inflation than before, as will the price of restaurant meals. Households spend much the same as before on food and drink. In 2011, the ABS estimated we spent 16.8% of our spending each week on food and non-alcoholic beverages, now that is down slightly to 16.1%. But the big change has been within the category. We now spend a lower share of our money each week on every sub-group within the category except restaurant meals: The changes also affect the way cost of living is calculated. The record low interest rates has meant that households now spend less each week paying off their mortgage than before. In 2011, the ABS estimated the average employee household spent $181.95 a week on interest rate charges, now it is just $144.56. The reduction in money spent by households paying their mortgage has shifted to other items \u2013 especially childcare, rent, utilities and, surprisingly, international holidays: It means in the future interest rate cuts or rises will have less of an impact on cost of living than in the past. But the good news is that from next year the ABS will be updating the CPI basket every year in December, which will ensure the inflation figures are more reflective of how we spend our money. But no amount of adjustment of the data will rework the retail sales figures. With the latest wage price data out next week, the terribly weak retail trade figures suggest households have not received much of an increase in their income, and what little they have, they have not felt confident enough to spend it in the shops.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The oil price has hit its highest level since July 2015 after Saudi Arabia\u2019s crown prince increased his power in the kingdom by launching an anti-corruption purge. Billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal was among the princes, ministers and officials detained by Mohammed bin Salman, who said recently that he backed an extension to production curbs by the world\u2019s biggest oil-producing countries. Oil cartel Opec is to consider prolonging the production cuts at a meeting in Vienna at the end of November. Analysts said the uncertainty generated by the future king\u2019s actions were behind the price of international benchmark Brent jumping to more than $62 a barrel, compared with around $50 in the first half of the year. \u201cThe price rise is a reaction to the uncertainty from Saudi Arabia,\u201d said Mihir Kapadi, chief executive of wealth management company Sun Global Investments. Other factors have edged the oil price upwards. Saudi Arabia, Russia, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan met over the weekend and said they were willing to maintain restrictions on oil production, to address a glut in supply and prop up prices. \u201cThe participating states expressed satisfaction with the decline in commercial oil inventories and expressed their readiness to continue joint efforts in this direction,\u201d the Russian energy ministry said in a statement. The growth in US oil rigs this year \u2013 indicating a production increase by the world\u2019s third largest producer \u2013 has muted the recovery of the oil price but the number of rigs plateaued in August. Last week the number fell by 11, down to 898. Other recent geopolitical events have also played a role in oil\u2019s new high, with concerns over the Iraqi government\u2019s actions in Kurdish oil-producing areas and increased attacks on oil infrastructure in the Niger delta. However, experts at Swiss banking group Julius Baer said the oil price high would not last and was likely to fall back towards $50 a barrel, as demand eased off. \u201cThe seasonal soft patch should challenge the market tightening narrative while the market mood can only deteriorate from today\u2019s overly bullish levels,\u201d said Norbert R\u00fccker, the bank\u2019s head of macro and commodity research. Ian Taylor, of oil trader Vitol, told the Guardian he expected the price to come back down to $55-57 next year. \u201cI\u2019m not sure it\u2019s totally sustainable [the current price],\u201d he said. The crackdown by Saudi Arabia\u2019s future king is seen by industry watchers as unlikely to change the country\u2019s position on Opec policy. Mohammed bin Salman is pushing the sale of 5% of the the kingdom\u2019s national oil company, Aramco, the valuation of which hinges on the oil price. Analysts at investment bank RBC Capital Markets said the crown prince \u201cseems strongly committed to anchoring the Opec agreement deep into 2018 and moving ahead with the Aramco sale\u201d. Joseph McMonigle, senior energy policy analyst at HedgeEye, said the uncertainty in Saudi Arabia compounded issues in other oil-producing regions. \u201cOil markets were already facing major geopolitical risks with Iraq\u2019s response to the Kurdistan independence bid, potential new US sanctions on Iran and an economic and political collapse in Venezuela. \u201cNow we can add an unsettled Saudi political environment and attempted Houthi-Iran missile attack on Riyadh to the mix. Geopolitical risks have just spiked and oil prices are heading higher,\u201d he said. Saudi Arabia is the world\u2019s biggest oil-producer, and Opec\u2019s key player. The UAE and Iraq, which are both in the oil cartel, have also said they would back an extension to production curbs which were due to end in March 2018. The deal involves oil countries reducing production by 1.8m barrels a day, in an effort to bring global oil supply and demand back into balance.",

      "bodyText": "Ladbrokes Coral has been ordered to pay \u00a32.3m by the gambling regulator for failing to intervene after two problem gamblers lost \u00a31.3m of stolen money on its casino website. Days after a government review warned online gambling firms to tighten up controls or face tougher legislation, the Gambling Commission said it found \u201csignificant flaws\u201d in the bookmaker\u2019s dealings with two \u201chigh-spending\u201d customers. An \u201caggravating factor\u201d was that Gala Coral, which merged with Ladbrokes last year, had previously vowed to identify similar cases much sooner, after being hit with an \u00a3880,000 penalty in April last year. The commission said the firm\u2019s Gibraltar-based casino website Gala Interactive should have spotted signs of addiction in two unnamed gamblers, and had also failed to put in place written policies and procedures that could have curbed their behaviour. One of the gamblers lost \u00a3837,545 over 14 months while the other lost \u00a3432,765 in 11 months, both of them using stolen money. They have since been jailed, the first for four years for stealing from their employer, the other for four and a half years for acquiring, using or possessing criminal property. Sarah Harrison, the commission\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cWe will continue to take robust action where we see operator failures that harm consumers and the wider public. It is the responsibility of all operators [...] to ensure they are protecting their customers and step in when there is behaviour that might indicate problem gambling. \u201cThis did not happen in this case and the \u00a32.3m penalty package should serve as a warning to other operators.\u201d Harrison has taken a tougher stance with the industry since taking over in October 2015, handing out eight penalties worth nearly \u00a316m combined to firms including Paddy Power Betfair, Betfred and 888. Ladbrokes Coral will pay \u00a31.3m to the victims of the two customers and \u00a31m towards research into the causes of problem gambling, which leading gambling charity GambleAware says is underfunded. It has also volunteered to pay a further \u00a3200,000 towards problem gambling research, beyond the settlement with the commission. The bookmaker\u2019s chief executive, Jim Mullen, said: \u201cRunning a gambling company carries a huge responsibility to ensure that it is done so in a safe and responsible manner. When any part of our business fails to meet the required standards, it is right that they are held to account. \u201cIn the two cases reviewed with the commission, it was clear that within our operations, we had not met our own standards or those demanded by the commission.\u201d He said the failures were \u201cevidence of a lack of priority being given to changes in approach identified in earlier engagements\u201d. \u201cBeing public with our failings is an uncomfortable experience for any business, but we believe it is right that others can see the extent of our mistakes and try to learn from them,\u201d he added. In a review of gambling regulation published last week, the government called on the industry to improve and speed up efforts to identify and address problem gambling. \u201cThe government, and the Gambling Commission, will be paying close attention to industry progress in this area and will act accordingly,\u201d the review said, adding that \u201clegislative controls\u201d could follow if the commission\u2019s powers were deemed insufficient.

    "webTitle": "New Fed chair Jerome Powell was the best choice \u2026 for Trump", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Jerome Powell was Wall Street\u2019s choice to run the Federal Reserve. Given Donald Trump\u2019s record on doing the unexpected, there was always the chance the president would pick another candidate, but for once he did not make waves. Powell was the business-as-usual candidate. Nothing he has said or done since he first joined the Fed\u2019s board five years ago suggests he intends to make life difficult for Trump or rattle the financial markets. Well, not deliberately at least, for while Powell is the boring choice, he may not necessarily prove to be the safe choice. Clearly, the safest choice would have been for Trump to appoint Janet Yellen for a second term as chair of the world\u2019s most powerful central bank. After all, she has presided over a period in which the US economy has grown, unemployment has fallen steadily and inflation has remained below its target. What\u2019s more, without any real tremors, she took the first steps towards the normalisation of monetary policy by edging up interest rates and starting to unwind the Fed\u2019s quantitative easing programme. This is quite a task, because all central banks are to an extent flying blind. Their models tell them that falling unemployment should by now have led to a significant pick-up in wage inflation, but that\u2019s not happening. The chances of policy error are high. Washington politics explains why Powell has a seat on the board. Barack Obama wanted Jeremy Stein to fill one of two vacancies, but thought his nominee might be blocked by a Republican-dominated Senate. Needing a Republican makeweight to ease Stein\u2019s passage, Obama chose Powell. Nothing that has happened since suggested that Powell was destined for greater things. His boilerplate speeches have tended to focus on regulation, and when straying into the realm of monetary policy he has been careful not to deviate from whatever the current Fed orthodoxy might be. Had Trump lost the presidential race, there would not have been the slightest chance of Powell getting the top job. Churchill\u2019s put-down of Attlee \u2013 a modest man with much to be modest about \u2013 summed him up. Churchill was, of course, wrong about Attlee, and it is possible that Powell will go on to be one of the all-time great Fed chairmen. But it seems unlikely. Trump did not want Yellen because she was a Democrat. He didn\u2019t want John Taylor or Kevin Warsh because they think the Fed needs to get ahead of the curve on inflation by raising interest rates more quickly. What the president wanted was a Republican without particularly strong views on monetary policy, someone who would continue with Yellen\u2019s softly, softly approach to raising rates but would be ready to roll back some of the post-crisis regulations imposed on the financial sector. By those criteria, Powell was the perfect choice. And, in the right circumstances, he may do just fine. If monetary policy is all about the occasional tweak to interest rates \u2013 as it was in the Great Moderation of the 1990s \u2013 there will be little to fear. Things will get trickier if it proves harder than the Fed thinks to steer the US economy between recession and inflation, or if a crisis arrives from an unexpected quarter. Unlike Yellen or her predecessor Ben Bernanke, Powell is not an economist. He is a lawyer by training, and has worked in investment banking and private equity. Being a trained economist is not everything. There have been trained economists \u2013 Arthur Burns in the 1970s, for example \u2013 who have made a right pig\u2019s ear of running the Fed. But equally there are times \u2013 such as when Mario Draghi rescued the euro from its existential crisis in 2012 \u2013 when being a journeyman is not sufficient. And there is nothing in Powell\u2019s CV or his time at the Fed to suggest he is anything more than that. Oil is up: but what would really help renewables is costlier carbon High oil prices are a boon for the renewables industry. The higher the price of consuming black gold, the more consumers will be prepared to try alternatives, from solar to wind. So the industry might have been expected to cheer the surge last week in Brent crude prices to near a two-year high of $60 a barrel. Yet the steep cuts in the cost of offshore wind and especially solar electricity generation mean that the economics are already running in their favour. In some countries, wind and solar power are now cost-competitive with oil, coal and natural gas-fired power plants, even when carbon emissions are not priced in. That leaves the momentum with renewables, even when the oil price falls \u2013 as it did in 2014, when the price of a barrel tumbled from around $115 over 18 months to less than $40 in January 2016. And that\u2019s just as well, since oil prices are unlikely to rise much more, despite the public statements from Opec and Russia that they will hold back about 1.8m barrels per day until next spring in an attempt to push prices higher. There is more to come from the Americans, who mothballed many of their derricks before hurricane Harvey hit the Gulf. So US production, despite hitting its highest level for at least three decades, is likely to rise further, which will act to depress prices. That\u2019s not to say governments can relax and watch renewables win the day. Putting a price on carbon emissions remains important when global temperatures are rising fast. Unfortunately, the European system of carbon credits, which is supposed to tax heavy carbon users, is mired in controversy after several years of handing out credits that make it cheaper to belch out CO2 than invest in environmentally friendly alternatives. The market price for credits is \u20ac6 a tonne when it needs to be nearer \u20ac50. The remedy is for governments to sidestep the failed market in carbon credits and impose a steeper cost on users. That would help much more than a rise in oil prices. Ryanair is flying as high as ever \u2013 even without its pilots Ryanair bosses chose not to face the press last week when announcing half-yearly results \u2013 an absence surely unrelated to a decision in September to cancel thousands of flights due to lack of pilots. Yet what the airline had to report was bulging profits, followed by news of its busiest October, cancellations or not. Plenty of pilots remain disgruntled, despite the airline\u2019s deep delve into its pockets to prevent an exodus to competitors. The rotas fiasco was never likely to be a \u201cRatners moment\u201d for chief executive Michael O\u2019Leary, a man who had long made an art of upsetting his customers. But Ryanair looks to have been barely jolted by the turbulence \u2013 and now, as competitors fall by the wayside, it forecasts higher revenues for the winter. Not that much higher, though: this autumn\u2019s lesson will reaffirm O\u2019Leary\u2019s conviction that the only way Ryanair could lose its passengers would be by raising fares.",

      "body": "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/nov/02/jay-powell-federal-reserve-janet-yellen\" title=\"\">Jerome Powell</a> was Wall Street\u2019s choice to run the Federal Reserve. Given <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\" title=\"\">Donald Trump</a>\u2019s record on doing the unexpected, there was always the chance the president would pick another candidate, but for once he did not make waves.</p> <p>Powell was the business-as-usual candidate. Nothing he has said or done since he first joined the Fed\u2019s board five years ago suggests he intends to make life difficult for Trump or rattle the financial markets. Well, not deliberately at least, for while Powell is the boring choice, he may not necessarily prove to be the safe choice.</p> <p>Clearly, the safest choice would have been for Trump to appoint Janet Yellen for a second term as chair of the world\u2019s most powerful central bank. After all, she has presided over a period in which the US economy has grown, unemployment has fallen steadily and inflation has remained below its target. What\u2019s more, without any real tremors, she took the first steps towards the normalisation of monetary policy by edging up interest rates and <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=Fed+raises+rates+Guardian&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-b-ab&amp;gfe_rd=cr&amp;dcr=0&amp;ei=lnb8WfywBqyGgAb_kKmgCg\" title=\"\">starting to unwind the Fed\u2019s quantitative easing programme</a>.</p> <p>This is quite a task, because all central banks are to an extent flying blind. Their models tell them that falling unemployment should by now have led to a significant pick-up in wage inflation, but that\u2019s not happening. The chances of policy error are high.</p> <p>Washington politics explains why Powell has a seat on the board. Barack Obama wanted Jeremy Stein to fill one of two vacancies, but thought his nominee might be blocked by a Republican-dominated Senate. Needing a Republican makeweight to ease Stein\u2019s passage, Obama chose Powell.</p> <p>Nothing that has happened since suggested that Powell was destined for greater things. His boilerplate speeches have tended to focus on regulation, and when straying into the realm of monetary policy he has been careful not to deviate from whatever the current Fed orthodoxy might be. Had Trump lost the presidential race, there would not have been the slightest chance of Powell getting the top job. Churchill\u2019s put-down of Attlee \u2013 a modest man with much to be modest about \u2013 summed him up.</p> <p>Churchill was, of course, wrong about Attlee, and it is possible that Powell will go on to be one of the all-time great Fed chairmen. But it seems unlikely. Trump did not want Yellen because she was a Democrat. He didn\u2019t want John Taylor or Kevin Warsh because they think the Fed needs to get ahead of the curve on inflation by raising interest rates more quickly.</p> <p>What the president wanted was a Republican without particularly strong views on monetary policy, someone who would continue with Yellen\u2019s softly, softly approach to raising rates but would be ready to roll back some of the post-crisis regulations imposed on the financial sector. By those criteria, Powell was the perfect choice.</p> <p>And, in the right circumstances, he may do just fine. If monetary policy is all about the occasional tweak to interest rates \u2013 as it was in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/2017/jan/08/economic-forecasts-hardwired-get-things-wrong\" title=\"\">Great Moderation</a> of the 1990s \u2013 there will be little to fear.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "New car sales have declined for the seventh month in a row, falling more than 12% in October as worsening confidence among consumers and businesses continues to dampen the market. The figures show that the car market is on course for its first annual decline since 2011 and will continue to fall next year before stabilising in 2019, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). The industry body said car registrations dropped 12.2% year-on-year to 158,192 last month \u2013 the second double-digit decline this year. It is an acceleration from the 9.3% fall in car sales in September, the first time the market had declined in September in six years. In April, sales plummeted 19.8% after an increase in vehicle excise duty. Diesel sales tumbled by nearly 30% last month after the scandal over rigging emissions tests and political rumblings over restrictions on diesel cars. Demand for electric and hybrid cars continued to rise, up by nearly 37% to 8,244, while petrol models posted a small increase of 2.7%. Mike Hawes, the SMMT chief executive, said: \u201cDeclining business and consumer confidence is undoubtedly affecting demand in the new car market, but this is being compounded by confusion over government policy on diesel. Consumers need urgent reassurance that the latest, low-emission diesel cars on sale will not face any bans, charges or other restrictions, anywhere in the UK.\u201d Alluding to last year\u2019s Brexit vote, the industry body has blamed business and political uncertainty for reduced buyer confidence, deterring households and businesses from big ticket purchases. Ana Nicholls, automotive analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit, said: \u201cIt\u2019s not just a question of drooping consumer confidence \u2013 the economics of the car market have also changed in the past few months. With the pound so low, carmakers can no longer afford to use the kind of discounting and offers they have been using to keep the market buoyant.\u201d She said the Bank of England\u2019s interest rate rise last week would not help either, with 86% of all cars bought on credit \u2013 many of them on personal contract plans \u2013 and total car loans now amounting to nearly \u00a360bn. A recent bleak survey from the CBI sounded the alarm on the state of the high street. It showed retail sales falling at their fastest rate since the height of the recession in 2009 in October, as rising inflation squeezed Britons\u2019 spending power. A few days later, Britain\u2019s biggest clothing retailer Next reported a fall in October sales and warned of \u201cextremely volatile\u201d trading. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: \u201cCar registrations still are falling at an alarming rate, highlighting how reluctant consumers currently are to make financial commitments. \u201cWorryingly, sales are falling rapidly even though generous discounts are available for buyers trading in old, high-polluting diesel vehicles. Most manufacturers\u2019 diesel scrappage schemes are set to close at the end of this year ... The downward trend likely will be amplified by increases in personal loan rates in response to last week\u2019s Bank rate hike. Accordingly, the outlook for car sales looks bleak.\u201d The SMMT figures showed demand from businesses and fleet orders dropped 26.8% and 13% respectively last month. Dealers reported 10% fewer private buyers taking delivery of new cars in October. This means that the overall market is down 4.6% this year so far on 2016 levels, with more than 2.2m cars registered. The SMMT forecast that the market would end the year at 2.56m vehicles \u2013 a 4.7% decline, with a further decline of 5.4% next year. The van market also declined by 7.4%, another sign of the drop in business confidence. Sales of smaller vans tumbled by 20%. Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said: \u201cBusinesses have become more reluctant to replace or add to their fleets amid weakened economic activity and a highly uncertain outlook.\u201d He said the Bank\u2019s rate rise could \u201cweigh down on car sales \u2013 possibly more through affecting consumer and business psychology rather than the actual increase in car loan rates which will likely be limited\u201d. Richard Jones, managing director of motor finance provider Black Horse, part of the Lloyds Banking Group, was more sanguine. He said the car market was moving to a \u201cmore sustainable position\u201d following years of strong growth. \u201cIn the longer term this correction in sales is positive for the market, and should reduce concerns of new car oversupply impacting negatively on used-car values. We must also remember Brexit has already had an impact on the UK car market through the fundamental shift in the exchange rate which is impacting car prices, making the market correction even more understandable.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Insurance laws will be overhauled to ensure all parties are covered in any accident involving autonomous vehicles, the government has said, in a move that paves the way for self-driving cars to be on UK roads by 2021. Questions over liability have been seen as a stumbling block in the development of autonomous vehicles. The issue is seen as being particularly acute during any transition period for the technology, when cars will not be fully autonomous and drivers will remain legally in charge of a vehicle even when cars are on autopilot. Insurers have warned that confusion over responsibility could leave drivers without cover for their own losses in the event of an accident. The government will rule that future policies must cover injuries to all parties where automated vehicles are involved, the secretary of state for transport, Chris Grayling, will say on Monday. In a speech to insurers in which Grayling will claim self-driving cars will be in use by 2021, he will say: \u201cWe are creating a new compulsory insurance framework that covers the use of automated vehicles and when the driver has legitimately handed control to the vehicle. This will ensure that victims have quick and easy access to compensation.\u201d The Thatcham Research centre, a motoring body funded by the insurance industry, has urged the government to speed up the reforms going through Parliament under the Automated and Electric Vehicles bill. While insurers believe that self-driving cars will eventually cut road accidents, there is concern that cars billed as autonomous could confuse consumers. Audi launched its A8 model in June, which has an autopilot mode with which the car is able to navigate itself through slow-moving traffic, as well as find a space to park itself in autonomously. However, the legal and insurance implications of these cars are yet to be fully defined. Although drivers must currently remain in the front seat with their hands on the wheel during semi-autonomous or highly assisted driving, the industry and politicians have raised safety concerns about when drivers have to resume full control. A House of Lords science and technology committee report warned that advanced cars could make \u201cdrivers complacent and overly reliant on technology\u201d. Audi claims its A8, which will be on the roads next year, has reached a level of autonomy classed by engineers as Level 3 \u2013 where the car can do most tasks but a driver has to intervene in some circumstances. The Lords report found: \u201cIt may be the case that for Level 3 vehicles the risks will be too great to tolerate.\u201d Ben Howarth, a senior policy adviser at the Association of British Insurers, said: \u201cPeople could wrongly think their vehicles can be left alone to manage a journey independently. Insurers want to see manufacturers being absolutely clear about how they describe what their vehicles can do.\u201d Thatcham has drawn up a 10-point checklist of features, which it says manufacturers of automated cars should adhere to, including clearly signalling their automated capabilities and mechanisms to ensure the handover of control from human to machine and back is explicit. Matthew Avery, director of research at Thatcham, said the new checklist would help \u201cshine a light into the potentially dangerous grey area semi-automated vehicles could create\u201d. He said that, currently, drivers would not be insured for their own injuries in the event of a crash caused by their vehicle driving autonomously, although they would be able to claim as a passenger in a fully automated car.",
