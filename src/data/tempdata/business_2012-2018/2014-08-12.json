      "bodyText": "Bailed-out Royal Bank of Scotland has given 10 top executives share awards worth a total of \u00a33.5m under a new pay scheme dodging tough new European Union rules on bankers' bonuses. Rory Cullinan, head of the new mini \"bad\" bank inside RBS, was on Tuesday awarded \u00a3533,000 of shares, the equivalent of 100% of his salary so far this year. The fresh \"fixed share allowance\" payment comes just two months after Cullinan collected more than \u00a3600,000 worth of shares in the first instalment of his \u00a32.5m 2013 bonus. RBS, which is 81% owned by the government after its \u00a345bn bailout during the 2008 financial crisis, lost \u00a38.2bn last year \u2013 its sixth year of consecutive losses that have also totalled \u00a345bn since its rescue by taxpayers. The bank wanted to pay its executives the equivalent of 200% of salary but was blocked by the Treasury in April. It means RBS is limited to paying out up to 100% of salary \u2013 the maximum allowed by new EU rules without the express permission of shareholders. RBS is the only big UK bank that is being prevented from paying 200% bonuses. The government supported 200% bonuses at Lloyds, which was also bailed out by taxpayers and is now 25% owned by the state following the sale of shares to the private sector. The Treasury told RBS that \"there will be no rise\" while the bank is \"still in recovery\". The chancellor, George Osborne, said: \"We made it clear that in the circumstances it was not right to increase the bonus cap. \"We're moving from a situation a few years ago where bonuses were out of control, banks were being bailed out, [and] our economy was shrinking, to the situation we've got now, where bonuses are down, banks are recovering, and our economy is growing.\" RBS has warned it faces an \"exodus of talented staff\" if it is unable to match the pay levels offered by rivals. Penny Hughes, the non-executive director who chairs the remuneration committee, said: \"I know it is not always easy to accept, but if RBS is to thrive we must do what it takes to attract and keep the people who will help us achieve our goals. \"While we are sensitive to public opinion, particularly given our ownership structure, the ability to pay competitively is fundamental to getting RBS to where we need it to be.\" The new shares, which are awarded for the eight months to the end of August, can be cashed in 20% chunks each year for the next five years. Fresh awards will be made every six months, and are not subject to Bank of England rules on clawbacks that were designed to retrospectively recoup bonuses in the event of any wrongdoing emerging in the future. Chris Sullivan, RBS's deputy chief executive, was awarded \u00a3467,000 worth of shares. Sullivan hit the headlines last month when Andrew Tyrie, chair of the Treasury select committee, accused him of being \"wilfully obtuse\" in evidence to parliament. Sullivan had told the committee that RBS's controversial global restructuring group (GRG) was \"absolutely not a profit centre\" but was later forced to write to Tyrie admitting, that on an accounting basis, the operation was run as a profit centre. RBS last week announced it was closing down the GRG division, which is being investigated over allegations that it profited from the financial distress of small companies it was meant to help. GRG has been the focus of allegations \u2013 notably by Lawrence Tomlinson, an adviser to the business secretary, Vince Cable \u2013 that it forces viable small businesses to the brink so the bank can buy up their properties and make a profit. Ross McEwan, RBS chief executive, did not receive a share award after foregoing bonuses. However, in June he received shares worth almost \u00a31.5m as part of a \u00a33m signing-on deal. His basic pay and benefits stretch to \u00a31.3m.",

So when Carney presents the Bank of England's inflation report on Wednesday, the City will be watching closely for any hints over the timing of a rise from the record low of 0.5%. Do not expect a definitive answer: Carney is likely to trot out his usual line that the data will determine the timing of the first hike and increases will be \"gradual and limited\". However, there should be clear hints on what the odds are. One will come from the outlook for wage growth \u2013 the weaker the expectation, the less likely an early rate hike will be. The second thing to watch out for will be the Bank's estimate of spare capacity in the economy. At the time of the May inflation report, monetary policy committee members estimated between 1% and 1.5% of slack, unchanged from the February report. Carney and his colleagues have made it clear the optimal timing of a rate rise is before all the slack has been used up. If the latest forecast shows a considerable drop in the estimate to between 0.5% and 1% of GDP, economists are more likely to bet on a 2014 hike. Lastly, the market will be studying the outlook for growth and inflation. The Bank has been among the most upbeat when forecasting UK growth, back in May predicting 3.4% this year and 2.9% in 2015. Given the relative strength of the Bank's previous forecasts, major revisions are unlikely. The economy has performed better than expected this year, but there are some signs that elements of the economy are starting to slow.

The insurance group's first-half operating profits \u2013 the figure most closely watched by the market \u2013 rose to \u00a31.5bn before tax. Prudential welcomed the Chancellor's shake-up of the UK pensions market, which scrapped the requirement for pensioners to swap their pension pots for an annuity. Under the reforms, instead of being provided with an annuity \u2013 a regular income from the pension pot that a person has accumulated during their working life \u2013 workers will be able to spend their pension pots on whatever they wish. That caused a 43% slump in sales of personal annuities to \u00a363m, which was in line with Prudential's peers. Tidjane Thiam, Prudential's chief executive, said the pensions overhaul, announced in the budget, had caused \"considerable disruption to the market for annuities\". But he welcomed the changes, which he said would \"be beneficial both for customers and Prudential in the long term\". The UK division still posted a 10% increase in operating profits, lifted by Pru's life and retirement division, which wrote more pension insurance deals with corporate schemes. The US business boasted the healthiest performance, with operating profits up 28%, as stronger stock markets and an improving economy lifted consumer confidence. Thiam said the Pru's US division was focused on meeting the needs of 77 million baby boomers as they enter retirement. In Asia, Prudential continued to enjoy strong demand from the region's rapidly growing middle class, offsetting political instability and floods in Indonesia, as well as the military takeover in Thailand. Thiam said: \"The strategy has been, is and will remain, to grow fast and aggressively in Asia. How we do it is really a function of opportunity.\" He took the opportunity to rage against shareholders that stood in the way of the insurer's $35.5bn (\u00a321bn) bid for rival AIA back in June 2010. \"That opportunity has passed. There was one opportunity; we managed to get it and we didn't conclude it. My only frustration is that we didn't succeed.\" Thiam said the group would not change \"aggressive\" expansion plans in Asia, despite challenging conditions. \"In the first half of this year, some of our markets experienced headwinds as a result of political and economic events such as the uncertainty over the outcome of presidential elections in Indonesia or the military takeover in Thailand. These shorter-term cyclical pressures do not detract from the long-term structural trend of growing demand for our products and services from the rapidly growing and underinsured middle classes.\" Richard Hunter, head of equities at Hargreaves Lansdown Stockbroker said: \"Even set against high expectations, Prudential continues to storm ahead, leaving many of its rivals in its wake. Its strategy is bearing fruit in each of its geographies, in particular Asia and the US.\"",

Ten years on, the 52-year-old single mother makes around \u00a38 an hour working part-time at her local Sure Start children's centre in Southampton. With the cost of living rising faster than her pay, Chicken's wages have fallen even further in real terms, a pattern likely to be reflected across the country in the latest official labour market figures today. After bills and housing costs, Chicken is left with \u00a3108 a week to feed herself and her son, buy clothes and anything else they need. They eat well, she said, but there is little left for treats or outings. \"We don't really have enough money to go on holiday \u2026 I don't get haircuts, I very rarely buy any clothes,\" she said. \"What I have had to do is pull myself back over the last 10 years to a position that isn't as good as it was because I got knocked off my perch.\" Wednesday's figures are expected to show unemployment continuing its rapid fall, but the prospect of wage growth overtaking inflation seems as elusive as ever. Economists polled by Reuters reckoned average earnings including bonuses fell 0.1% in the three months to June compared with a year earlier. Inflation was at 1.9% in June. For charities and trade unions it will be further evidence that although more people are in work, for many of them it does not pay. Chicken is not expecting the economic upturn to filter through to her wages. \"I don't expect my pay to match inflation, I don't expect to have a job beyond April and I expect to be looking for something else,\" she said. Her situation is familiar for the charity Gingerbread. Single parents are almost twice as likely to be in low paid work as others and one in five have seen their incomes fall, according to its latest research. Labour market experts are generally downbeat about pay and conditions catching up with the rest of the recovery. Business surveys suggest employers are becoming more confident but economists see little prospect of wage growth returning to pre-recession rates. Their pessimism is largely down to Britain's poor performance on productivity \u2013 measures of output per worker and output per hour. \"Most employers will be very reluctant to increase wages much until we see faster productivity increases, and no one knows how long the productivity slowdown will persist,\" said Ian Brinkley, chief economist at Lancaster University's Work Foundation. The thinktank says that on top of slow wage growth, the UK is suffering from a high incidence of low pay, affecting around a fifth of the workforce. It has called for policy measures to move Britain to higher wage business models in its \"Bottom 10 Million\" research. The low pay problem is badly affecting some young workers, according to Jenny North, policy director at one of the research programme's sponsors, Impetus Private Equity Foundation. They are being thwarted by an \"hourglass\" employment structure, she said, that has polarised the workforce between low wage, low skill jobs and high wage, high skill jobs with little space in the middle. \"What's concerning is that the young people with the most potential can't progress into the top half of the hourglass,\" she said. But campaigners for fairer pay say there have been some glimmers of hope. The Living Wage Foundation has seen the number of employers who are signed up to its scheme quadruple to more than 800 in the last year, with recent high profile joiners including Nestl\u00e9 and HSBC. The foundation's chair, Mike Kelly, hopes businesses are becoming more aware of the benefits of paying the living wage, which is calculated to provide a basic but acceptable standard of living. It is currently set at \u00a38.80 an hour in London and \u00a37.65 elsewhere while the national minimum wage is \u00a36.31. Kelly got involved with the living wage movement when his employer, KPMG, adopted it in 2006 and he is responsible for implementing it for all UK staff and contractors at the company. He uses KPMG as an example of how higher pay and more consultation with staff can cut costs rather than raise them. The turnover of cleaners fell from 44% to 27% in the first year of the living wage at KPMG, which at the same time changed shifts to more sociable hours, increased holiday and introduced free English lessons. The company's cost of running its facilities in the UK has gone down by \u00a31m since 2006, Kelly said. \"We got the best people. They stayed longer, they were more flexible and took on more responsibility so we got higher productivity.\" There are also signs consumers are becoming increasingly conscious of which companies pay a fair wage, Kelly added. A recent survey of more than 1,000 consumers by KPMG found four out of 10 said they would not hesitate to shop elsewhere if their preferred store did not pay the living wage. Living wage employers also hope it will help retain staff as the labour market continues to recover. \"I know people do a job for many reasons but money is a driving force and people will jump ship even if it's for a tiny bit more,\" said Sarah Moverley at the Health Insurance Group, which recently signed up to the living wage. The insurance broker has 97 staff in Sheffield and Southampton and they were all on at least the living wage already, said Moverley, head of human resources. But signing up will safeguard any new recruits and help hold on to them, she added, highlighting an average recruitment cost of \u00a32,000 for each new employee. \"I think we have got to put a little bit in to get something out of people and the least we can do is pay a bit more,\" said Moverley.",

      "bodyText": "US markets are in flat to negative territory on opening. The Dow Jones is off 0.07% at 16,557 points, while the Nasdaq and S&amp;P500 are broadly flat. The more dramatic story is on German\u2019s Dax, which has extended its losses and is now down 0.74% at 9113 points, following a worse-than-expected fall in investor confidence. The bad mood appears to be affecting France\u2019s CAC40, which is down 0.53% at 4175 points. But the other big economies of the eurozone seem to have escaped the contagion. Spain\u2019s IBEX is up 0.74% at 10,268 points, while Italy\u2019s leading share index is up 0.46% at 19,551 points The FTSE100 is flat at 6631 points. We are calling it a day now and will return tomorrow for the UK\u2019s inflation report and Japanese GDP. Thank you for following and all your comments. A big event in Wednesday\u2019s economic diary is Japan\u2019s GDP data. And the headline number is expected to be bad. Economists have forecast a 7.1% annualised decline in economic output, a worse result than after the 2011 earthquake and tsunami, although not yet comparable to the shock of the global financial crisis when the economy contracted by 15%. But the poor performance stands out against growth in the US and other developed economies. The main culprit is Japan\u2019s consumption tax, which was raised to 8% from 5% on 1 April. This helped boost the economy at the start of the year, as people rushed out to spend to beat the tax, but has since suppressed activity. In a very useful Q&amp;A on Japan, the FT examines why Japan\u2019s problems are more than economic swings and roundabouts. Many people are worried. Not long ago economists were predicting a second-quarter pullback of a little more than 3%, less than half what they\u2019re forecasting now. Many have revised their estimates down in the past few weeks in response to a string of unexpectedly weak data, particularly on industrial output. The Wall Street Journal, in its 5 things to watch in Japan, thinks that weak GDP data could put pressure on the government to change direction. The data could intensify debate over whether to ramp up fiscal or monetary stimulus, and whether the government should postpone a two-percentage-point sales tax increase planned for October 2015. The GDP figures come at a time of growing doubts about the outlook for the economy. When is the Bank of England going to raise interest rates? That is the question on everybody\u2019s mind ahead of a two-day meeting of the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee starting tomorrow. The consensus is that the BoE will keep interest rates frozen at their record low of 0.5%. On Wednesday we will get the Bank\u2019s quarterly inflation report; their view on interest-rates will be published on Thursday. Mark Carney is expected to say that a house price crash remains a risk to the recovery and policymakers must be vigilant to prevent prices getting out of control. Economists polled by Reuters expect a rate rise to 0.75% in the first quarter of 2015, with a 45% chance that rates will go up this year. But it is unlikely the Bank will be giving away many clues this week. James Knightley at ING expects the Bank of England to stay vague. The Bank of England will acknowledge the strength of the UK economy, but will be ambiguous on when policy may start to be tightened at tomorrow\u2019s Inflation Report briefing. The meeting will also put Bank of England governor Mark Carney\u2019s brainchild policy, forward guidance, in the spotlight. Samuel Tombs at Capital Economics is not impressed by this innovation. Guidance does not seem to have provided much fuel to the recovery. Granted, confidence surged after guidance was introduced, and our model of consumer confidence suggests that economic variables alone cannot fully explain this pick-up. But GDP growth has not visibly sped up since August. Despite this sub-par record, we doubt that the MPC is about to abandon its fledgling policy innovation. The policy is too closely connected to the Governor to be disposed of soon... The government could have a battle on its hands if it goes ahead with plans to enforce standardised plain packaging for cigarettes in England. Philip Morris, the world\u2019s largest tobacco company, which makes Marlboro and Chesterfield cigarettes, is ready to sue the government should it implement this law. Philip Morris made the threat in a submission to the Department of Health, seen by Reuters. \u2019Standardized packaging\u2019 is a euphemism for government-mandated destruction of property. It is unlawful, disproportionate, and at odds with the most basic requirements of the rule of law. There is a very good reason for a tobacco company to be worried about plain packaging: it works. In Australia, smoking levels have fallen at their fastest rate in two decades since the introduction of a law that forced manufacturers to remove all corporate branding and add graphic health warnings to packets. There is no more Parmesan. They are running low on Camembert and Finnish butter. In Russia the most visible sign of the country\u2019s economic stand-off with the west are empty supermarket shelves, captured on this blog. The economic slump 0f 2008-09 was the worst since records began, but not quite as bad as previously thought, according to the Office for National Statistics. Statisticians at the ONS have been tweaking their data and found that the UK economy shrank less than previously thought during the 2008-09 recession. The latest revisions show that British economic output was 4.6% lower in 2009 than 2007. Previous estimates put the decline at 5.2% and 6%. The ONS has said the average growth rate in the UK economy between 1998-2009 was unchanged at 2.2.%. The Independent\u2019s economics editor Ben Chu has a good graph. Deflation is also a risk for the eurozone\u2019s third largest economy. Italy\u2019s national statistics office has reported that prices fell 2.1% month-on-month in July, confirming an earlier estimate. Prices are flat on last year. Statisticians say the much steeper monthly drop is explained by summer discounting of clothes and shoes. But the data has raised further scepticism about Mario Draghi\u2019s statement that long-term expectations for inflation are \u201cwell anchored\u201d, i.e. their forecasts are solid. The president of the European Central Bank last week told eurozone worriers to relax and go to the beach... or words to that effect, according to FT Markets columnist James Mackintosh, who has an interesting take on Draghi\u2019s most recent press conference. Expectations anchored? Not everyone is convinced. Amid fears of a slowdown in Germany, elsewhere in the eurozone deflation is a big concern. Anxiety levels will not be helped by Portugal\u2019s latest economic data, showing that the consumer price index fell 0.7% in July, compared with the previous month. Average prices have fallen 0.2% since last year. Portugal\u2019s national statistics agency said downward pressure came from the falling price of food, non-alcoholic, drinks, clothing and footwear. But Portuguese households faced rising costs for housing, water, electricity, gas, alcoholic drinks and tobacco. Germany\u2019s leading share index, the Dax, is down 0.37% at 9148 points following the worse-than-expected economic confidence survey. The euro has fallen 0.31% to $1.3342. Fear is back. A worrying sign. Economists are clearly concerned by the unexpectedly-large fall in German investor confidence in August. But they are not putting all the blame for Germany\u2019s weak economic growth on international events. Carsten Brzeski at ING says the German slowdown is \u201chomemade and Eurozone-made\u201d. Fear is back. The German ZEW just sent more signs of caution, showing the at least financial market participants are increasingly becoming pessimistic... It will still take until Thursday before the hard facts will be presented but based on all available data the German economy should have stagnated. A stagnation as such is no reason to get overly concerned. Contrary to a common belief, any stagnation of the economy was not so much the result of crisis in the Ukraine and European sanctions on Russia. Sure, German exports to Russia have nosedived in recent months but they only account for around 3% of all German exports. Stronger demand from the US and UK has more than offset these export losses. In fact, net exports will probably have been one of the few growth drivers in the second quarter. Instead, the stagnation should have been rather homemade. Or better: homemade and Eurozone-made. The reversal of the mild-weather-effect on the construction sector, an unusual amount of holidays in May combined with ongoing problems in France and Italy should have been the main drivers of the slowdown of the German economy. Looking ahead, today\u2019s ZEW sends a worrying signal that the growth performance in the second quarter could suddenly morph from a one-off into an undesired trend. Up to now, the fallout of the Ukraine crisis has been limited to a general return of uncertainty and a sharp drop in German exports to Russia. Obviously, a further escalation of the crisis could start to really hurt the economy. Jennifer McKeown, senior European economist at Capital Economics, says that Germany\u2019s recovery appears to have passed its peak. August\u2019s drop in the German ZEW economic sentiment indicator is another worrying sign, particularly as perceptions of current conditions are now weakening sharply too....The decline must relate largely to fears about the effects of the Ukraine crisis, which could prove short-lived given the recent partial recovery in German equity prices. But the further confidence falls, the greater the risks to actual economic activity. Indeed, note that the ZEW current conditions index fell for the second month running to +44.3 \u2013 its lowest level since January. This deterioration mirrors the recent decline in more reliable indicators of business activity such as the German PMI and Ifo surveys. Data later this week are likely to reveal that the German economy more or less stagnated in Q2. While a renewed expansion seems likely in Q3 and beyond, the recovery seems to have passed its peak. Here is the full statement on German economic confidence, a survey carried out by the Zew Centre for Economic and Social Research. The steep fall in German investor confidence has dragged down the indicator showing investor mood across the whole eurozone. The decline in economic sentiment is likely connected to the ongoing geopolitical tensions that have affected the German economy by now. In particular, current figures on industrial production and incoming orders suggest markedly reduced investment activities on the part of German firms against the backdrop of uncertain sales prospects. Since the economy in the Eurozone is not gaining momentum either, the signs are that economic growth in Germany will be weaker in 2014 than expected. The assessment of the current economic situation in Germany has decreased as well. The respective indicator has lost 17.5 points and now stands at 44.3 points. The ZEW Indicator of Economic Sentiment for the eurozone also declined significantly in August. The indicator has lost 24.4 points compared to the previous month, now standing at 23.7 points. The indicator for the current economic situation in the euro area decreased in August by 2.3 points to a value of minus 33.8 points. Industrial production and incoming orders suggest \u201cmarkedly reduced investment activities by German firms\u201d. Zew are forecasting that economic growth in Germany will be weaker than expected for 2014. Investor confidence in Europe\u2019s biggest economy has slumped: the Zew Institute\u2019s economic sentiment index fell to 8.6 points, versus 27.1 in July, and far below expectations of 17-18 points. An important footnote on sanctions is that some countries will suffer more than others. Latvia, which sends one sixth of its exports to Russia, will be far harder hit. Unsurprisingly, geography determines trade flows with Russia, meaning that the Baltic countries, Finland will feel the effects more than southern Europe, as this chart neatly illustrates. Germany\u2019s economy ministry is far from the only institution concerned about weakness in the eurozone. Amid the usual anxieties, the Ukraine crisis is something of a wild card. Economists at Oxford Economics think that the impact of the Ukraine crisis on the eurozone is unlikely to be too damaging. Although they warn that their forecasting could easily be overtaken by events. The indirect effects - general loss of confidence - could be worse than the direct effects - damage to trade flows. If the crisis does have adverse indirect effects, such as a weakening in sentiment, then its stands to reason that those countries with the closest linkages to Russia will suffer the most. However, if we look at the change in the Eurozone economies\u2019 Economic Sentiment Indices (ESIs) between May (when the Eurozone measure peaked) and July, there is no obvious correlation between the size of an individual economy\u2019s change in sentiment and the importance of Russia as an export market. The relationship is no better if we focus on industrial sentiment or alter the period over which we assess changes in sentiment. All this suggests that the recent easing in eurozone sentiment may not be down to the crisis in Ukraine. The full briefing is available here. Germany\u2019s economy ministry has warned that the Ukraine crisis, troubles in the Middle East and weakness in the eurozone have weighed on the German economy in the second quarter, although positive growth trends remain intact. The uncertainties may well weigh more than the effects of the sanctions [on Russia]. All in all, the mood in the economy has notably darkened... the positive underlying tendency continues to remain intact. Via Reuters Prudential has warned that the Eurozone \u201ccontinues to grapple with significant unresolved economic and political challenges\u201d. The insurer\u2019s statement has just hit the wires, as it publishes its results. Half-year operating profit is up 17% to \u00a31.5bn. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has also found that Germany\u2019s economy has lost momentum, as we highlighted yesterday. This chart, based on the OECD\u2019s indicator for growth, shows just how far Germany\u2019s economy has lost pace since 2011. GlaxoSmithKline\u2019s woes continue to deepen, with fresh allegations that the pharmaceutical company bribed Syrian doctors to boost sales of its medicines. GSK is one of the few firms still supplying drugs to war-torn Syria and although the business is small, the charge of bribing medical professionals and officials is extremely damaging in the light of similar allegations from China, Poland and Jordan. Here are the main allegations set out by Reuters: The 6 August email from a person familiar with GSK\u2019s Syrian operations said the alleged bribes in its pharmaceuticals business took the form of cash, trips and free medical samples. \u201cGSK has been engaging in multiple corrupt and illegal practices in conducting its pharmaceutical business in Syria,\u201d according to the lengthy email addressed to chief executive Andrew Witty and Judy Lewent, chair of GSK\u2019s audit committee. The email cited names and dates of alleged illicit payments, including the case of a Syrian doctor who personally received between $200 and $300 a month in free samples in exchange for ordering GSK drugs for his hospital and rejecting rival ones. Germany\u2019s economy is slowing down and may have even shrunk in the second quarter. If that is borne out by GDP statistics on Thursday, how will Angela Merkel respond? David Marsh, chairman of the London and Oxford Group, is not expecting a dose of unconventional monetary policy, in the form of quantitive easing. If German growth really does come under pressure because of worsening geopolitics, then Chancellor Angela Merkel is far more likely to re-invent herself this fall as a disciple of reflationary state spending and tax measures rather than to overcome her supreme distaste for QE-style monetary adventurism. His full comment is on the Wall Street Journal\u2019s Market Watch. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and the business world. Europe\u2019s biggest economy is our focus this morning, with a widely-respected survey of economic sentiment expected to show that investor confidence in Germany has fallen to its lowest level since December 2012. The Zew economic sentiment indicator for August is expected to come in around 17-18, down from 27 in July, the 8th straight month of decline. A combination of economic sanctions on Russia, unrest in the Middle East that is weighing on global markets and the lacklustre performance of the rest of the eurozone, has been dampening the mood in Germany. Economists polled by Reuters are expecting GDP data released on Thursday to show that the German economy stagnated in the second quarter, although some are predicting an outright contraction. Apart from that it is a quiet day for economic data. On the corporate front we are expecting half-year results from the Pru at 9.15.",

The German ZEW just sent more signs of caution, showing the at least financial market participants are increasingly becoming pessimistic...</p> <p>It will still take until Thursday before the hard facts will be presented but based on all available data the German economy should have stagnated. A stagnation as such is no reason to get overly concerned. Contrary to a common belief, any stagnation of the economy was not so much the result of crisis in the Ukraine and European sanctions on Russia. Sure, German exports to Russia have nosedived in recent months but they only account for around 3% of all German exports. Stronger demand from the US and UK has more than offset these export losses. In fact, net exports will probably have been one of the few growth drivers in the second quarter. Instead, the stagnation should have been rather homemade. Or better: homemade and Eurozone-made. The reversal of the mild-weather-effect on the construction sector, an unusual amount of holidays in May combined with ongoing problems in France and Italy should have been the main drivers of the slowdown of the German economy.</p> <p>Looking ahead, today\u2019s ZEW sends a worrying signal that the growth performance in the second quarter could suddenly morph from a one-off into an undesired trend. Up to now, the fallout of the Ukraine crisis has been limited to a general return of uncertainty and a sharp drop in German exports to Russia. Obviously, a further escalation of the crisis could start to really hurt the economy.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Jennifer McKeown, senior European economist at Capital Economics</strong>, says that Germany\u2019s recovery appears to have passed its peak.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>August\u2019s drop in the German ZEW economic sentiment indicator is another worrying sign, particularly as perceptions of current conditions are now weakening sharply too....The decline must relate largely to fears about the effects of the Ukraine crisis, which could prove short-lived given the recent partial recovery in German equity prices. But the further confidence falls, the greater the risks to actual economic activity.</p> <p>Indeed, note that the ZEW current conditions index fell for the second month running to +44.3 \u2013 its lowest level since January. This deterioration mirrors the recent decline in more reliable indicators of business activity such as the German PMI and Ifo surveys. Data later this week are likely to reveal that the German economy more or less stagnated in Q2. While a renewed expansion seems likely in Q3 and beyond, the recovery seems to have passed its peak. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-53e9db7ae4b036ebde648e34\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-08-12T09:16:50.398Z\">10.16am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/MarkitEconomics/statuses/499119469969821697\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>ZEW current conditions at 7-month low (44.3), economic sentiment at 20-month low (8.6).

In the UK, New Look plans to close at least two stores this year and longer term will consider closing 13 to 18 loss-making outlets unless leases can be renegotiated. Kristiansen said the group was well placed for the year ahead, although he cautioned that the second quarter faced tougher numbers compared with last year. \u2022 This article was amended on 12 August",

Having graduated from law school at a time when Houston law firms weren\u2019t hiring women, <a href=\"http://www.makers.com/kay-bailey-hutchison\">Hutchison went on to become the city\u2019s first TV news reporter</a> and the first woman to represent Texas in the US Senate.<br></p> <p>Shying away from demonstrations for women\u2019s rights, Hutchison decided to fight for women by proving that women like her could do their jobs as well as men. As a result, in 1972, Hutchison ran for a seat on Texas state legislature. She did so as a single woman and won. <br></p> <p>\u201cI became the first Republican woman ever elected to the Texas House of Representatives,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.makers.com/kay-bailey-hutchison\">she says</a>.

One of her prouder accomplishments in the Senate was passing the Homemaker IRA bill, which enabled stay-at-home moms to make the same contributions to their IRA accounts as salaried workers. Shortly before her retirement from Senate, Senator Barbara Mikulski <a href=\"http://www.mikulski.senate.gov/media/pressrelease/12-12-2012-3.cfm\">proposed renaming the bill after Hutchison, saying</a>:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Homemaker IRA was Senator Hutchison\u2019s idea. She came to me and she said, \u2018You know, Senator Barb, there are stay-at-home moms, they are limited to only $500 to what they can contribute to an IRA. And if they have the money, and if they have the will and the wallet, we should give them the same tax opportunities as if they were working in the marketplace because work at home should be valued as well.\u2019 And absolutely, we changed that legislation.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>As a result, the Homemaker IRA bill was <a href=\"http://blog.chron.com/txpotomac/2012/12/texmessage-homemaker-ira-renamed-kay-bailey-hutchison-spousal-ira-in-honor-of-the-retiring-senator/\">renamed to the \u201cKay Bailey Hutchison Spousal IRA</a>\u201d.</p> <p>Her career, however, is not without regrets. Her biggest regret is not passing a social security reform bill, which was <a href=\"http://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/state-politics/20120218-kay-bailey-hutchison-pushes-social-security-fix-in-her-final-year-in-senate.ece\">among one of her last efforts as a Senator</a>. <br></p> <p>Both IRAs and social security reform are of special importance for women, who are not only just living longer than men but often find themselves without appropriate funds to see them comfortably through retirement. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/us-money-blog/2013/sep/26/are-elderly-women-doomed-poverty\">According to the National Women\u2019s Law Center</a>, as of 2013, about 2.6 million elderly women are living in poverty.

She\u2019s currently consulting for Bracewell Giuliani. <br></p> <p>We caught up with Hutchison to talk about why women should care about economy, her life after Congress and her advice for women looking to enter politics. </p> <p><strong>When you served in the Senate, you often said that women did vote based on fiscal policies and economy because money is a women\u2019s issue. Why should women voters care about monetary policy? </strong></p> <p>It\u2019s the women who, generally, are running their family\u2019s finances. Having a strong economy and having two working people [in the] family determines their quality of life and how they can raise their children. When the economy is better, of course, the families are happier and more secure and those are usually women\u2019s first priorities. </p> <p><strong>Since you have been out of Congress, have you been meeting with your constituents? What are their concerns and wishes? </strong></p> <p>People are really concerned about the economy, and businesspeople, they are feeling stifled with regulatory overreach in this administration. The reason that people believe that we are not recovering from the doldrums is because the business is so over-burdened with regulations and taxes and the Obama healthcare requirements. It\u2019s not an environment conducive to adding new people and building businesses. </p> <p><strong>Is there anything that you wish you had done before leaving Congress? Or that maybe you think the current congress should tackle? </strong></p> <p>Social security reform. It would be so easy to do it. It\u2019s so clearly necessary. The steps that can be taken now before we are in a crisis are as painless as you can make a necessary adjustment to be. The longer we wait, the harder it\u2019s going to be, and we\u2019re not even seeing people willing to make any changes to what\u2019s really the most important retirement system for most people in our country. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-307fd88c-b31b-45d8-85a7-d4780f6a8f68\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/8/11/1407762565331/1e48690d-0a22-4b51-a1af-22a218042f52-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"US Money retirement swim elderly women \" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Women live longer than men. However, often they lack skills and funding to properly finance their retirement. Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>What adjustments would you make to social security? Would you lift the wage cap?</strong></p> <p>No, I wouldn\u2019t raise the wage cap and I wouldn\u2019t raise taxes at all. And I would not lower the benefit. I would make the age of retirement more in line with the actuarial tables for longevity and more in line with what was the case when social security was passed. If we do it really gradually now, we can do it in a three months a year increase and that three months wouldn\u2019t be noticed even. Instead of retiring at the age of 62, [you\u2019d] retire at 62 and three months. It would depend on if you did the early retirement or full retirement. </p> <p>Current full retirement age is [<a href=\"http://www.ssa.gov/retirement/1942.html\">65 and 10 months</a>]. If you were to raise it to 69 \u2013 that would be your stopping point \u2013 it would take about 14 years to get to that point, but it would put [Americans] in a position of having a secure system. I would also adjust the cost of living increase to a more realistic cost of living adjustment than the one that is in place right now.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/kaybaileyhutch/status/477572569113968640\" data-alt=\"US Money Kay Bailey Hutchison GOP Dallas pitch\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Had a great time with &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/GOP&quot;&gt;@GOP&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/DallasGOP&quot;&gt;@DallasGOP&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TexasGOP&quot;&gt;@TexasGOP&lt;/a&gt; selling Dallas for 2016!! &lt;a href=&quot;http://t.co/nLXvey3JMl&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/nLXvey3JMl&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Kay Bailey Hutchison (@kaybaileyhutch) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/kaybaileyhutch/statuses/477572569113968640&quot;&gt;June 13, 2014&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;script async src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> <figcaption>Recently, Hutchison helped make Dallas pitch to host the 2016 GOP convention. </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Is there anything you do not miss about Washington? </strong></p> <p>Anything I do <em>not</em> miss? </p> <p><strong>Yes. </strong></p> <p>I do not miss any of it.

      "bodyText": "Former Texas senator Kay Bailey Hutchison is more than familiar with the obstacles women face when pursuing their dreams. Having graduated from law school at a time when Houston law firms weren\u2019t hiring women, Hutchison went on to become the city\u2019s first TV news reporter and the first woman to represent Texas in the US Senate. Shying away from demonstrations for women\u2019s rights, Hutchison decided to fight for women by proving that women like her could do their jobs as well as men. As a result, in 1972, Hutchison ran for a seat on Texas state legislature. She did so as a single woman and won. \u201cI became the first Republican woman ever elected to the Texas House of Representatives,\u201d she says. She remains the only woman to have represented the Lone Star state in the Senate. While Hutchison says that she does not consider herself a feminist, female financial independence is an issue close to Hutchison\u2019s heart. One of her prouder accomplishments in the Senate was passing the Homemaker IRA bill, which enabled stay-at-home moms to make the same contributions to their IRA accounts as salaried workers. Shortly before her retirement from Senate, Senator Barbara Mikulski proposed renaming the bill after Hutchison, saying: The Homemaker IRA was Senator Hutchison\u2019s idea. She came to me and she said, \u2018You know, Senator Barb, there are stay-at-home moms, they are limited to only $500 to what they can contribute to an IRA. And if they have the money, and if they have the will and the wallet, we should give them the same tax opportunities as if they were working in the marketplace because work at home should be valued as well.\u2019 And absolutely, we changed that legislation.\u201d As a result, the Homemaker IRA bill was renamed to the \u201cKay Bailey Hutchison Spousal IRA\u201d. Her career, however, is not without regrets. Her biggest regret is not passing a social security reform bill, which was among one of her last efforts as a Senator. Both IRAs and social security reform are of special importance for women, who are not only just living longer than men but often find themselves without appropriate funds to see them comfortably through retirement. According to the National Women\u2019s Law Center, as of 2013, about 2.6 million elderly women are living in poverty. About 733,000 of them live in extreme poverty. Hutchison co-founded of Fidelity National Bank of Dallas and owned a candy manufacturing company. She\u2019s currently consulting for Bracewell Giuliani. We caught up with Hutchison to talk about why women should care about economy, her life after Congress and her advice for women looking to enter politics. When you served in the Senate, you often said that women did vote based on fiscal policies and economy because money is a women\u2019s issue. Why should women voters care about monetary policy? It\u2019s the women who, generally, are running their family\u2019s finances. Having a strong economy and having two working people [in the] family determines their quality of life and how they can raise their children. When the economy is better, of course, the families are happier and more secure and those are usually women\u2019s first priorities. Since you have been out of Congress, have you been meeting with your constituents? What are their concerns and wishes? People are really concerned about the economy, and businesspeople, they are feeling stifled with regulatory overreach in this administration. The reason that people believe that we are not recovering from the doldrums is because the business is so over-burdened with regulations and taxes and the Obama healthcare requirements. It\u2019s not an environment conducive to adding new people and building businesses. Is there anything that you wish you had done before leaving Congress? Or that maybe you think the current congress should tackle? Social security reform. It would be so easy to do it. It\u2019s so clearly necessary. The steps that can be taken now before we are in a crisis are as painless as you can make a necessary adjustment to be. The longer we wait, the harder it\u2019s going to be, and we\u2019re not even seeing people willing to make any changes to what\u2019s really the most important retirement system for most people in our country. What adjustments would you make to social security? Would you lift the wage cap? No, I wouldn\u2019t raise the wage cap and I wouldn\u2019t raise taxes at all. And I would not lower the benefit. I would make the age of retirement more in line with the actuarial tables for longevity and more in line with what was the case when social security was passed. If we do it really gradually now, we can do it in a three months a year increase and that three months wouldn\u2019t be noticed even. Instead of retiring at the age of 62, [you\u2019d] retire at 62 and three months. It would depend on if you did the early retirement or full retirement. Current full retirement age is [65 and 10 months]. If you were to raise it to 69 \u2013 that would be your stopping point \u2013 it would take about 14 years to get to that point, but it would put [Americans] in a position of having a secure system. I would also adjust the cost of living increase to a more realistic cost of living adjustment than the one that is in place right now. Is there anything you do not miss about Washington? Anything I do not miss? Yes. I do not miss any of it. [Laughs] I am happy to be in the private sector. I love the variety of what I am doing and I always felt that it was fulfilling to be able to make a difference in a a good way. But if you are not making a difference, it\u2019s not as fulfilling to have a position in Congress. Right now, it\u2019s very hard to feel fulfilled when there\u2019s such a stalemate. Would you say that Washington is still a very much a boys\u2019 club? I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good old boys\u2019 club. There [are] a number of women, who are in the system now.
