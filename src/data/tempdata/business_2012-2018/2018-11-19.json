      "bodyText": "US stock markets dropped sharply on Monday as big technology companies led losses, and fears over an escalating trade war with China rattled investors. The Dow Jones Industrial Average briefly fell 500 points, ending the day down 396 points (1.56%). Apple, Microsoft and Amazon, the most valuable companies on the market, sustained some of the worst losses. Apple dropped close to 4% on renewed worries that iPhone sales could slow and Amazon lost 5%. Facebook dropped 5.7% as the company continued to struggle with issues related to its reaction to the discovery of manipulation of its platform. The arrest of Nissan chairman Carlos Ghosn on charges he underreported his income and misused company funds caused the company\u2019s shares to tumble and shocked many in Japan who view him as something of a hero. US-traded shares of Nissan lost 5.8%, while Renault shares dropped 8.4% in Paris. In Asia, the Shanghai Composite Index fell 1% to 2,675.69 and Tokyo\u2019s Nikkei 225 lost 0.9% to 21,633.54. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng retreated 1.3% to 26,023.02 and Seoul\u2019s Kospi shed 0.7% to 2,086.50. In Japan, chief cabinet secretary Yoshihide Suga said on Tuesday the government was watching for economic fallout from the scandal at one of the world\u2019s biggest vehicle manufacturers. The so-called Faang companies (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google) whose rises helped drive stock markets to record highs have all suffered sharp losses in recent weeks. Each is down more than 20% from its year high \u2013 technically known as a bear market. \u201cI\u2019ve been looking for them to show some leadership which they fail to do, and until we get the tech leadership I think equities are going to continue to struggle,\u201d said Peter Cecchini, the managing director at Cantor Fitzgerald in New York. The jittery trading came after two days of gains last week as investors hoped that the US and China were moving closer to settling their costly trade fight, which has been a major uncertainty for investors. Those hopes faded after the two countries clashed at a Pacific Rim summit over the weekend. A steep loss for Boeing, a major exporter which would stand to suffer greatly in a protracted trade war, also weighed heavily on the Dow. The S&amp;P 500 index fell 44 points, or 1.6% while the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 2.7%. The disagreements between the US and China at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting left investors pessimistic about the prospects for a deal that would end trade tensions between the world\u2019s two largest economies. For the first time in almost 30 years, leaders at the summit could not agree on a joint declaration on world trade. Talks between the US and China are continuing ahead of a meeting between Xi Jinping, the Chinese president, and Donald Trump planned for the G20 summit later this month.",

      "bodyText": "They do corporate scandals differently in Japan. The downfall of Carlos Ghosn over alleged under-statement of income and \u201cnumerous\u201d acts of misconduct was spectacular in its own right, but the accompanying press conference by Nissan chief executive Hiroto Saikawa was an event in itself. Saikawa did not merely report the allegations against his chairman, which is what you might expect on day one in equivalent circumstances at a European and US company. He also trashed Ghosn\u2019s legacy, criticised his decision-making and speculated as to how the alleged misdeeds could have happened. That content would normally be reserved for the full corporate post-mortem, or at least until the legal process had run its course. In short, Saikawa said he felt \u201ca strong sense of indignation and despair\u201d. He added that the three-way alliance between Nissan, Renault and Mitsubishi \u2013 with Ghosn, the creator of the global set-up, as the towering figure at each entity \u2013 \u201cconcentrates power on one individual. This is not the only cause but it is one of the factors or drivers\u201d. It\u2019s certainly true that governance arrangements at the Nissan-Renault-Mitsubishi combo cemented Ghosn\u2019s power. Renault owns 43% of Nissan, the French firm having rescued the Japanese carmaker under Ghosn\u2019s leadership in 1999. In turn, Nissan owns 15% of Renault. And Nissan owns 34% of Mitsubishi. These over-lapping holdings seems to have been managed by giving the main man top billing everywhere. Thus Ghosn was chairman of the two Japanese firms and chairman and chief executive of Renault. \u201cThe Alliance partnership will not be affected by this event,\u201d continued Saikawa. Really? The cross-shareholdings may remain the same, at least in the short-term. But the Nissan chief, with his eye-catching criticisms of Ghosn\u2019s management style, also seemed to be making a straightforward power-play with the aim of asserting more Japanese influence. The French state, with 15% ownership of Renault, will not have missed the comments. Expect a Franco-Japanese fight for control of the alliance. Bramson will have his work cut out for him at Barclays If Edward Bramson is seeking a post on the board of Barclays, the bank\u2019s response to the activist investor ought to be very simple: sorry, old fruit, but a 5% holding doesn\u2019t get you in the door. Bramson hasn\u2019t actually said whether he wants a board position \u2013 indeed, he\u2019s said next to nothing publicly since his Sherborne fund unveiled its Barclays holding in March \u2013 but agitation from within is usually the way he likes to operate. Yet a 5% investment doesn\u2019t give anyone automatic entry to the boardroom. As it is, Sherborne is merely the fourth largest shareholder in Barclays. If Bramson lacks might, he will have to persuade other investors to back him. But that will require him to be open about his alternative vision for Barclays \u2013 the one that would allocate less capital to investment banking. His current tactic is to lobby fund managers in private, an approach that can only be considered a warm-up routine. What\u2019s required is a clear set of proposals that can generate a proper debate over strategy. Who knows? Bramson may have some decent ideas and a few counter-arguments to Barclays chief executive Jes Staley\u2019s defence of returns from investment banking. But, until he publishes an analysis he\u2019s prepared to defend, Bramson\u2019s just a punter with a large leveraged position. That doesn\u2019t buy a seat on the board. Debbie Crosbie a decent bet for TSB For a bank that has suffered TSB\u2019s calamities in the past year, the hiring of Debbie Crosbie as chief executive counts as a decent result. She is the chief operating officer at CYBG, owner of Clydesdale and Yorkshire banks, and thus a serious operator in the \u201cchallenger\u201d league of second-tier banks. Crosbie is also reckoned to be a technology specialist, which would plainly be useful given TSB\u2019s botched upgrade that has cost \u00a3250m so far. By the time she arrives, TSB may even have cleared the backlog of complaints from affected customers. So, a fresh start for TSB, then? Well, maybe. It\u2019s certainly true the TSB brand may not be permanently damaged. Surprisingly few customers have switched their accounts. The Financial Conduct Authority\u2019s report on the IT disaster \u2013 expected next year \u2013 may also have little impact in the outside world. Yet it\u2019s hard to know if Sabadell, TSB\u2019s Spanish parent, has been scarred by its UK experience and still has an appetite for the adventure. As City analysts were quick to point out, CYBG itself might be a natural home for TSB eventually.",

    "webTitle": "Public service providers will have to draw up 'living wills'", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Companies that provide critical public services will have to draw up \u201cliving wills\u201d, to prevent taxpayers being saddled with the cost if another major outsourcer such as Carillion collapses, under plans outlined by the government. The Cabinet Office unveiled a series of proposals designed to reform government procurement in the wake of Carillion\u2019s failure, which has cost the taxpayer an estimated \u00a3150m. They involve greater transparency by public services providers and a promise that outsourcing will act as a \u201cforce for good\u201d, with the government required to consider social and economic benefits when awarding contracts. But perhaps the most eye-catching measure is the creation of \u201cliving wills\u201d, similar to those that banks were forced to draw up in the wake of the financial crisis. Key suppliers of services such as hospital cleaning, prison maintenance or school meals will have to write contingency plans to ensure limited interruption and cost if they go under and other companies or the government are handed the keys. \u201cCarillion was a complex business and when it failed it was left to government to step in \u2013 and it did,\u201d said Cabinet Office minister David Lidington, in a speech to the Business Services Association. \u201cBut we did not have the benefit of key organisational information that could have smoothed the management of the liquidation.\u201d \u201cBy ensuring contingency plans can be put in place in the very rare event of supplier failure, we will be better prepared to maintain continuity of critical public services,\u201d he said. Labour said the plans had come too late. Shadow cabinet office minister Jon Trickett said: \u201cThis is too little too late from a government more concerned with defending outsourcing than protecting the hundreds of millions of taxpayers\u2019 money that has gone down the drain in failed outsourcing projects. \u201cThe reason the government did not have the \u2018benefit of key organisational information\u2019 on Carillion is because in the critical months before its collapse they didn\u2019t bother to appoint anyone to monitor the firm.\u201d Outsourcing companies have volunteered to test the plan and have offered to write their living wills \u201cwithin weeks\u201d, the Cabinet Office said. Procurement will also be geared towards what the Cabinet Office called \u201csocial value\u201d. By summer 2019, the government procurement process will have to give more weight to ensuring that contracts benefit local small businesses, provide employment opportunities for disadvantaged groups \u2013 including disabled people \u2013 and reduce harm to the environment. \u201cPublic services should be delivered with values at the heart,\u201d Lidington said. \u201cIt is right that we use the government\u2019s purchasing power to benefit society.\u201d Trickett also criticised plans he said would be meaningless without proper scrutiny of how companies were abiding by the requirements. \u201cTalk of social value is meaningless without proper supervision and enforcement, and it will take a Labour government to end the outsourcing racket and ensure public services are delivered in the public interest,\u201d he said. Among other measures unveiled by Lidington, the central government will for the first time publish information about the performance of critical contracts, such as whether or not they are delivering on time. The government\u2019s oversight of Carillion, which was the responsibility of the Cabinet Office, came in for heavy criticism in a joint report by two select committees investigating its collapse. A separate report by the Public Accounts Committee found that the government was too slow to spot trouble brewing at the stricken construction firm, which held public contracts worth more than \u00a3350m a year. The Cabinet Office operates a traffic light scheme \u2013 with red as the most risky and green the least \u2013 assessing the finances of its \u201cstrategic suppliers\u201d. The red category is considered the last step before a company can be labelled \u201chigh risk\u201d, at which point the government should stop awarding them new contracts and seek to reduce any existing work. Carillion was not designated as red until July 2017, after it had issued its first profit warning to the market. The Guardian revealed that the government knew of a plan that could have retrieved more than \u00a3360m from Carillion, limiting the cost of its collapse to taxpayers and sparing pension scheme members from cuts to their retirement payouts, but did not encourage directors to pursue it.",

      "bodyText": "A major European lender and two US banks have become embroiled in an alleged \u20ac200bn (\u00a3178bn) money-laundering scandal at Danske Bank, following new testimony by a key whistleblower. Howard Wilkinson, who served as head of Danske Bank\u2019s trading unit in the Baltic region until 2014, told a Danish parliamentary hearing that other lenders were involved in processing billions of dollars worth of suspicious payments with links to Danske\u2019s Estonian branch. \u201cI would guess that $150bn (\u00a3117bn) went through this particular bank [the large European bank] in the US,\u201d the Briton said, though he stopped short of naming any of the lenders involved. Officials in Denmark, the US, Estonia and Britain are investigating about \u20ac200bn worth of payments made through Danske\u2019s small Estonian branch between 2007 and 2015. \u201cNo one really knows where this money went. All we know is that the last people to see it were these three large banks in the US. They were the last check and, when that failed, the money was into the global financial system,\u201d Wilkinson said. Deutsche Bank, JP Morgan and Bank of America were all reportedly involved in clearing dollar transactions for Danske\u2019s Estonian branch in Tallinn. It is understood that JP Morgan ended its relationship with that branch in 2013, while reports have said Deutsche did the same that year. It is not known whether these are the banks referred to in Wilkinson\u2019s comments. They have not been accused of any wrongdoing. All three banks declined to comment. Danske was also thrown into hot water after Wilkinson said the bank had offered him hush money to stop him speaking out. However, he was given the go-ahead to speak to US authorities last month. Wilkinson said he began looking into some of the three most profitable accounts involving British limited liability partnerships (LLPs) in January 2014 but it became clear by April that year that \u201cthe bank didn\u2019t intend to do anything\u201d. \u201cThey were all fake. Not just that, they all basically looked the same. And it turned out they all had the same registered office in a suburb in north London \u2026 I passed those on. By April, none of the accounts \u2026 had been closed down,\u201d Wilkinson said. \u201cI warned them [Danske] that if they didn\u2019t do a proper investigation and make the appropriate report to the police, then I was going to do it myself,\u201d Wilkinson said. Now he worries there is little chance that the funds will be recovered. \u201cThere is no chance in the world \u2026 that any of that money is ever going to be tracked down and that any criminals lose a single cent,\u201d he said. Speaking to Danish lawmakers following Wilkinson\u2019s testimony, Danske Bank\u2019s interim chief executive, Jesper Nielsen, lamented the damage to the lender\u2019s reputation. \u201cWe have breached the expectations society had of us. The case and the course of events around it does not reflect the bank we want to be,\u201d he said.",

    "webTitle": "Nissan to sack chairman Carlos Ghosn over 'serious misconduct' - as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "And finally, here\u2019s our latest take: Carlos Ghosn, the chairman of Nissan and one of the world\u2019s most powerful automotive executives, has been arrested by Japanese prosecutors in a move that sent shockwaves through the industry. The 64-year-old French-Brazilian is suspected of having understated his income on financial statements and was exposed by a whistleblower. Nissan said it will fire him this week as the company admitted it had left him in control for too long. Ghosn is regarded as one of the leading figures in the global car industry, having forged an alliance between France\u2019s Renault, Nissan and Mitsubishi that created the world\u2019s second-largest car manufacturer. As well as chairing Nissan, Ghosn is chief executive and chairman of Renault and chairman of Mitsubishi. In a statement, Nissan said that \u201cover many years\u201d Ghosn and another senior executive, Greg Kelly, had been \u201creporting compensation amounts in the Tokyo Stock Exchange securities report that were less than the actual amount, in order to reduce the disclosed amount of Carlos Ghosn\u2019s compensation\u201d.... Goodnight! GW Here\u2019s more reaction to the Ghosn story: Renault\u2019s shares never really recovered from the shock of Carlos Ghosn\u2019s arrest and imminent dismissal from Nissan. After a wild day\u2019s trading, they have closed down over 8% at \u20ac59.06, as traders worry that the Nissan-Renault alliance could be in jeopardy. Tim Hubbard, assistant professor of management in the University of Notre Dame\u2019s Mendoza College of Business, argues Nissan has learned the perils of giving one executive too much power: \u201cCarlos Ghosn\u2019s arrest and, soon to be, dismissal over financial misconduct is yet another\u2014all too frequent\u2014example of a top executive being dismissed for misconduct in the executive suite. Ghosn was one of the car industry\u2019s most prominent executives who has been responsible for breathing life back into Nissan. Ghosn\u2019s arrest complicates a highly interconnected set of relationships between Nissan, Renault and Mitsubishi Motors. The equity stakes that they have between each other may be at risk. This has widespread implications for a large portion of the auto industry as these alliances have become more critical in the increasingly interconnected design, manufacturing, and support of auto customers worldwide. Ghosn\u2019s arrest is another unfortunate example of the perils of having too much power concentrated in one individual within\u2014and across\u2014corporations.\u201d My colleague Jasper Jolly has written a neat profile of Nissan\u2019s Ghosn, and his sudden fall from grace. Here\u2019s a flavour: Carlos Ghosn was, until Monday, a titan of the global car industry. The first person to lead two Fortune 500 companies at the same time, he also enjoyed an almost unique position as a foreign chief executive of a major Japanese company \u2013 even gaining the honour of a manga comic book version of his life and rice sculptures of his face in bento lunchboxes sold to Japanese businessmen. Yet in a remarkable development which has shocked the automotive industry, Ghosn will now be dismissed by Nissan on Thursday after alleged financial irregularities. Nissan did not hold back in its statement on Ghosn, accusing him and a senior colleague of \u201csignificant acts of misconduct\u201d including understating his pay to regulators and misusing company assets. Renault and Mitsubishi Motors, both of which Ghosn also chairs, have yet to respond. The ousting leaves the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi alliance \u2013 the maker of one in every nine cars manufactured worldwide last year \u2013 without its totemic leader as the electric and autonomous car revolutions threaten to upend the business models of established car manufacturers. Born in Brazil in 1954 to Lebanese immigrants, Ghosn\u2019s ascent to the pinnacle of the global car industry began in France, where he studied at the prestigious \u00c9cole Polytechnique in Paris before joining Michelin, the French tyre manufacturer. At 27 he was manager of a Michelin factory in France; at 36 he was chief executive of the firm\u2019s North American operations. In 1996 Ghosn (which rhymes with \u201ccone\u201d) was poached by Renault, where he made his mark with a deep restructuring \u2013 earning a reputation for a sleek but ruthless management style, and a nickname, \u201cLe Cost Killer\u201d.... More here: Update: Nissan President and CEO Hiroto Saikawa did give the media a bow as he exited today\u2019s press conference, as these photos show: The FT\u2019s Peter Campbell watched Nissan\u2019s press conference, and was stuck by the way that Nissan CEO Hiroto Saikawa deeply criticised chairman Carlos Ghosn: Nissan\u2019s dramatic press conference in Tokyo ended with another apology from Saikawa, this time for not being able to answer many of the media\u2019s questions. However, I don\u2019t believe he gave the traditional bow of contrition, which we\u2019ve seen in previous Japanese corporate scandals. Over in France, a union official has welcome the news that Ghosn is in hot water over his pay and alleged misuse of Nissan assets. Associated Press have the details: Ali Kaya, who heads the CGT union at a Renault factory in Flins outside Paris, said \u201cthe most shocking thing is that these people were not arrested well before this.\u201d He lamented that the public has grown inured to \u201castronomical sums\u201d paid to Ghosn and other executives. The powerful, hard-left CGT has long campaigned to cap executive pay. Nissan CEO Saikawa is still being quizzed by Japanese reporters, desperate for more details about Carlos Ghosn\u2019s impending sacking. He says that Nissan\u2019s internal investigation into the misconduct is almost complete, but won\u2019t comment on whether any other people are involved. Saikawa also explains that representative member Greg Kelly was a close advisor to Ghosn. Saikawa is really putting the boot into Carlos Ghosn now, claiming that the chairman\u2019s long reign had a \u201cnegative impact\u201d on business operations He does concede, though, that Ghosn had implemented valuable reforms and restructuring in his early days at Nissan. Some instant reaction to the Nissan press conference: The Nissan press conference is getting increasingly tense. One reporter tells CEO Saikawa that people who love Nissan cars will be shocked by today\u2019s news. Another asks whether Nissan has actually carried out a coup to remove chairman Ghosn. Saikawa says he can\u2019t comment on whether chairman Carlos Ghosn and board member Greg Kelly will face criminal charges. Journalists in Toyko are demanding more details about Carlos Ghosn\u2019s serious misconduct. Nissan CEO Saikawa, though, is refusing to give much away. He does say that Nissan\u2019s top executives only learned about the the probe earlier today. Saikawa also suggests that the misconduct went on \u201cfor a long period\u201d, before an unnamed whistleblower brought it to light. Nissan are now questions from the media in Tokyo: Q: Is it correct that Carlos Ghosn was arrested when he arrived at an airport in Japan today? Nissan CEO Hiroto Saikawa confirms that Ghosn had been due to arrive in Tokyo today, but he can\u2019t give any more details about the investigation. Carlos Ghosn\u2019s \u201cserious misconduct\u201d fell into three parts, according to Nissan: He misrepresented his compensation (pay) in the report to the Tokyo Stock Exchange He misrepresented the purpose of spending the company\u2019s investment He used the company\u2019s assets for personal use. Nissan CEO Hiroto Saikawa says too much power was concentrated in one executive (as explained earlier, Carlos Ghosn has been the driving force at both Nissan and Renault for almost 20 years) He pledges that efforts will be made to prevent the Ghosn scandal hurting the Renault-Nissan alliance (easier said than done, I fear) An emotional-sounding Hiroto Saikawa adde that he is \u201cdisappointed and frustrated\u201d by the actions of Chairman Ghosn and Representative Director Kelly. On behalf of the company, we offer a deep apology to shareholders, Nissan\u2019s CEO says. Saikawa also apologises to Nissan\u2019s employees and suppliers around the world for causing them \u201ccommotion and anxiety\u201d Nissan are holding a press conference in Toyko now. President and chief executive Hiroto Saikawa says that his understanding is that chairman Carlos Ghosn and Representative Director Greg Kelly have both been arrested today. Saikawa says he cannot give full details of the pair\u2019s actions, due to the ongoing investigations underway by the Japanese prosecutors office. He says auditors discovered a series of misconducts by Ghosn and Kelly; Nissan\u2019s \u201cspecialist evaluation\u201d is that the act is a serious misconduct that merits dismissal Nissan will organise a board meeting later this week to formally propose the removal of Ghosn as chairman, says Saikawa, who also calls Greg Kelly the \u201cmastermind\u201d of the scheme. More to follow..... French president Emmanuel Macron has now weighed in, saying the state will be \u201cextremely vigilant\u201d about the stability of Renault, and its alliance with Nissan. During a trip to Brussels, Macron told reporters that: \u201cIt\u2019s too early to comment on the reality or materiality of the accusations, about which I have no further information. \u201cAs a shareholder, however, the French government will remain extremely vigilant regarding the stability of the alliance, the group and ... its employees, who have the full support of the state.\u201d Here\u2019s a clip: The French government owns a 15% stake in Renault, making it the largest shareholder, and providing significant leverage over the alliance. Earlier this year it was pushing Nissan and Renault to integrate their operations more closely. It has also put pressure on Ghosn to invest more in France and create more jobs. Indeed, Macron and Ghosn visited a Renault plant in Maubeuge, Northern France, earlier this month to announce plans to build new vans there. Ana Nicholls, analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit, says Carlos Ghosn\u2019s shock ousting puts the entire future of the Nissan-Renault alliance under question. The strong bond between the French and Japanese carmakers depends partly on cross-shareholdings but even more on Ghosn\u2019s huge personal influence. He built his reputation as the man who turned around first Renault and then Nissan. This helped to maintain the trust between the two companies as their fortunes wax and wane, usually in a way that balanced each other out. His keen eye for cost-cutting underpinned the alliance\u2019s success in combining supplier networks, vehicle development and other central tasks in order to generate synergies. Ghosn also made it his personal mission to bring AvtoVAZ and Mitsubishi into the alliance, and had made (some) progress in turning them around too. \u201cIn an interview with The Economist Intelligence Unit in mid-November, Mr Ghosn seemed confident that this combination of diversity and synergy could survive his departure - that it wasn\u2019t just based on what he called \u201cthe human factor\u201d. Even so, his successor will face questions about whether to invest money in increasing the company\u2019s cross-shareholdings in order to cement the relationships, or risk the alliance falling apart. He or she may also be under pressure to show how the alliance can stop Tesla and GM from eroding its early lead in electric vehicles - and how the somewhat sporadic recent investment in mobility and connected car technology can be harnessed to help the alliance as a whole.\u201d Economics professor Thomas Piketty (an expert in inequality) has tweeted that Ghosn\u2019s alleged misconduct shows the perils of granting top bosses pay \u201cwithout limits\u201d.... There\u2019s massive media interest in Japan over the crisis gripping Nissan tonight. Journalists have gathered outside the Tokyo Regional Prosecution Office in Tokyo, awaiting fresh details on the investigation into Carlos Ghosn . Rumours of Carlos Ghosn\u2019s alleged \u2018serious misconduct\u2019 are flying around Japan. The Kyodo newswire is reporting that Ghosn is suspected of understating income by 5 billion yen over five years -- that\u2019s almost \u00a335m. Renault\u2019s shares are continuing to be pummelled; now down 14%. The news that Carlos Ghosn has ben arrested on suspicion of violating financial trading has \u201crocked investor confidence in the Paris-listed stock\u201d, says David Maddon of CMC Markets. The news that Carlos Ghosn is being ousted from Nissan is causing massive shockwaves in the car industry. For years, Ghosn has managed the seemingly impossible job of running one carmaker in Japan, and another in France. He\u2019s known for a ferocious work ethic, and charismatic leadership style that has helped him to turn Nissan and Renault around over the last two decades He was initially known as a \u2018cost-killer\u2019 in the 1990s, cutting tens of thousands of jobs and closing factories in Japan and Europe. That made him understandably unpopular, but over time his reputation in Japan swelled as Nissan returned to profitability. The Nissan-Renault alliance now makes one in nine cars sold worldwide. As Fortune magazine wrote in 2014, the Brazilian-Lebanese-French business chief was seemingly indispensable: Ghosn seems to be built for the job: He has the ability to connect with strangers instantly and to compartmentalize, no discernible private life outside his family, and a willingness to travel 300,000 miles a year (that\u2019s 11 circumnavigations). The question is, Who will run this leviathan, which he calls the Renault-Nissan Alliance, after the 60-year-old retires, or if, God forbid, something happens to him? It is such a demanding, bone-crunching job that Ghosn himself has said that after he leaves no one person should replace him. In fact, on numerous occasions he has said to a close former colleague: \u201cWho would want this job?\u201d He was even paid the rare accolade of having his face represented in sushi, in a \u201cCarlos Ghosn bento lunchbox\u201d. The FT explained: It is a measure of the extraordinary rise of Mr Ghosn in Japan that he should be deemed worthy enough to eat. The Japanese take their food seriously and do not welcome foreign intrusions. As such, the \u201cGhosn bento\u201d could be seen as a Japanese way of bestowing acceptance upon him. I\u2019ve only interviewed Ghosn once, at the World Economic Forum in Davos in 2016. Well I say interviewed -- I basically grabbed him walking in a corridor. Some CEOs aren\u2019t prepared to chat like that, but Ghosn was happy to explain how Nissan would cope with Brexit if it happened, without breaking stride as he marched briskly to his next meeting. Japanese newspaper Yomiuri is now reporting that Carlos Ghosn has been arrested by prosecutors in Tokyo. That\u2019s not been confirmed yet (obviously it\u2019s a fast-moving story...) Nissan has now issued a statement, accusing chairman Carlos Ghosn and \u2018representative\u2019 Greg Kelly of \u2018serious misconduct\u2019. The carmaker says the two men both under-reported Ghosn\u2019s salary, and also accuses its chairman of \u201cnumerous\u201d other acts of misconduct, including using Nissan\u2019s assets for personal use. Nissan has confirmed that it proposes removing both men from their positions, and has been working with Japanese prosecutors. Here\u2019s the full statement: Regarding serious misconduct by Nissan Chairman and one representative director Based on a whistleblower report, Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. (Nissan) has been conducting an internal investigation over the past several months regarding misconduct involving the company\u2019s Representative Director and Chairman Carlos Ghosn and Representative Director Greg Kelly. The investigation showed that over many years both Ghosn and Kelly have been reporting compensation amounts in the Tokyo Stock Exchange securities report that were less than the actual amount, in order to reduce the disclosed amount of Carlos Ghosn\u2019s compensation. Also, in regards to Ghosn, numerous other significant acts of misconduct have been uncovered, such as personal use of company assets, and Kelly\u2019s deep involvement has also been confirmed. Nissan has been providing information to the Japanese Public Prosecutors Office and has been fully cooperating with their investigation. We will continue to do so. As the misconduct uncovered through our internal investigation constitutes clear violations of the duty of care as directors, Nissan\u2019s Chief Executive Officer Hiroto Saikawa will propose to the Nissan Board of Directors to promptly remove Ghosn from his positions as Chairman and Representative Director. Saikawa will also propose the removal of Greg Kelly from his position as Representative Director. Nissan deeply apologizes for causing great concern to our shareholders and stakeholders. We will continue our work to identify our governance and compliance issues, and to take appropriate measures. Ghosn and Kelly are two of the three members of Nissan\u2019s \u2018representative board\u2019, alongside president Hiroto Saikawa. Blimey: Renault\u2019s shares have now plunged by over 10%. Traders in France are understandably shocked by the news that chairman Ghosn faces arrest in Japan for allegedly under-reporting his income. That wiping some \u20ac2bn off Renault\u2019s market capitalisation, taking its value down from \u20ac19bn to \u20ac17bn. Newsflash: We\u2019re getting more details from Japan about the shock investigation into Nissan/Renault chairman Carlos Ghosn. According to Japanese press agency Jiji: The Nissan Board will propose that Ghosn is \u201cterminated\u201d from its chairmanship. Nissan say Ghosn has used company money for \u201cpersonal use\u201d and committed \u201cseveral other serious acts\u201d Nissan says it has been \u201cinvestigating possible improper practices\u201d for several months, and has \u201cfully cooperated\u201d with investigators: Boom! Shares in Renault are sliding following a report that auto magnate Carlos Ghosn faces arrest in Japan. According to the Asahi newspaper, Ghosn is being probed by prosecutors for allegedly violating Japan\u2019s financial instruments and exchange act. Ghosn is apparently suspected of understating his own income on financial statements and had agreed to voluntarily speak to prosecutors. He is chairman of Japan\u2019s Nissan, and also chairman and chief executive of France\u2019s Renault. A Nissan spokesman said the company was making checks on the report, and will hold a press conference later today. The news has rocked the car sector, sending Renault\u2019s shares sliding by almost 6% to their lowest since 2015. Shares in UK builders are dropping this morning, following a report that house prices have fallen 1.7% this month. Online estate agent Rightmove reported that the average house price fell by \u00a35,000 in November, with wealthy parts of the South East suffering the biggest reversal. It appears that the \u2018ripple effect\u2019 of rising prices flowing outward from London is now reversing, as Brexit worries hit the economy. Miles Shipside of Rightmove says: \u201cHigher-end, former hotspot towns are now among the biggest annual fallers with Rickmansworth (-7.1%), Esher (-6.4%) and Gerrards Cross (-6.0%) now cold spots following price rises of nearly 40% over the seven preceding years.\u201d This has sent housebuilders into the list of FTSE 100 big fallers. Barratt Developments are down 1.4%, followed by Berkeley Group (-0.7%) and Persimmon (-0.6%). The pound has risen in early trading, shaking off some of last week\u2019s losses. Sterling is up 0.25% at $1.287 against the US dollar, as Theresa May continues to show impressive sticking power. Despite widespread criticism of her Brexit deal, Conservative MPs haven\u2019t yet mustered the 48 letters of no confidence needed to trigger a leadership contest. One critic, Simon Clarke MP, is trying to persuade fellow Brexiteers to demand a new leader, arguing: \u201cThis is absolutely the day at which we stand at the bar of history on this..... \u201cIt is quite clear to me that the captain is driving the ship at the rocks. However, other members of the European Reform Group - who demand a clean break from the EU - seem reluctant to do the deed, even though there\u2019s unhappiness about the terms of the transition deal and backstop negotiated between London and Brussels. Our political editor Heather Stewart says the ERG rebellion could fizzle out, unless they get to the 48-letter mark soon.... Despite the war of words between the US and China, European stock markets have opened higher. In London, the FTSE 100 is up around 0.5%, with similar gains in other major markets: Hussein Sayed, Chief Market Strategist at FXTM, warns that trading will probably be volatile, thanks to trade war worries and Brexit upheaval: U.S. Vice President Mike Pence didn\u2019t give the bulls what they wanted over the weekend. At the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit, Pence said there would be no end to U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods until China changes its ways. His comments suggest that a deal between President Trump and President Xi is unlikely to see the light when the leaders meet at the G20 Summit later this month. Given that we are near the end of the earnings season and the U.S. economic calendar has only tier 2 data to release, expect markets to trade on thin volumes. Political headlines will likely dominate, and thus expect volatility to remain high. China\u2019s Global Times, the state-sponsored newspaper, is often a good guide to Beijing\u2019s thinking. And today\u2019s editorial argues that it\u2019s \u201cnot a big deal\u201d that the APEC summit ended without a joint communique for the first time in a quarter of a century. It also takes a pop at the White House, saying: \u201cIt\u2019s delusional of some US elites to think that China is the largest beneficiary of the international system since they mistakenly blame China for the US\u2019 own problems. China has realized its development through hard work, not by taking advantage of the international system.\u201d Analysts at ING are also concerned that Mike Pence and Xi Jinpeng failed to mend any fences, saying: The risk to global economies and markets from the Sino-US trade war is elevated after an impasse between two countries at the APEC summit The discord between America and China over trade loomed over last weekend\u2019s APEC gathering in Papua New Guinea, says Royal Bank of Canada\u2019s Sue Trinh: She writes: The Sino-US discord was palpable at the APEC Summit in PNG, so much so that the confab ended with members unable to agree on a communiqu\u00e9, for the first time ever. Aside from this being further evidence of a growing anti-China alliance in the APAC region (watch out for Taiwan\u2019s referendum this Saturday to remove \u201cChina\u201d from the Olympic team name), the rhetoric is sharpening between the key players. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Fears of an escalating US-China trade war are weighing on the markets this morning, after the two powers clashed at a major summit over the weekend. US vice-president Mike Pence challenged Beijing\u2019s trade practices at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) in Papua New Guinea, criticising China for engaging in forced technology transfer and intellectual property theft. He told delegates that: The United States . . . will not change course until China changes its ways. \u201cWe have great respect for President Xi and China, but as we all know, China has taken advantage of the United States for many, many years and those days are over.\u201d Chinese President Xi Jinping was equally combative, criticising Washington\u2019s aggressive actions on trade. He argued: Unilateralism and protectionism will not solve problems but add uncertainty to the world economy. History has shown that confrontation, whether in the form of a cold war, a hot war or a trade war, produces no winners.\u201d But in an unprecedented move, the APEC leaders actually failed to sign off the traditional end-of-summit communique; a sign that cooperation was in short supply. One insider told CNN that Chine baulked at a line in the statement that read \u201cWe agree to fight protectionism including all unfair trade practices\u201d, taking it as a deliberate attack at China. Economists has hoped that the APEC meeting might have thawed relations between the two major powers. That could have helped to de-escalate the trade wars, paving the way for a formal breakthrough at this month\u2019s G20 meeting of world leaders. Instead, there\u2019s a growing risk that president Trump imposes further tariffs on Chinese exports to America, which would have a further chilling impact on trade and global growth. Also coming up today Investors will be glued to the latest developments in Westminster, as Theresa May continues to face down critics of her Brexit deal. The PM is due to speak at the CBI\u2019s annual conference today, where UK business leaders may warn of the perils of leaving the Eu without a transition arrangement. The agenda All day: CBI conference in London 10:00am GMT: Eurozone construction output for September",

He built his reputation as the man who turned around first Renault and then Nissan. This helped to maintain the trust between the two companies as their fortunes wax and wane, usually in a way that balanced each other out. His keen eye for cost-cutting underpinned the alliance\u2019s success in combining supplier networks, vehicle development and other central tasks in order to generate synergies. Ghosn also made it his personal mission to bring AvtoVAZ and Mitsubishi into the alliance, and had made (some) progress in turning them around too.</p> <p>\u201cIn an interview with The Economist Intelligence Unit in mid-November, Mr Ghosn seemed confident that this combination of diversity and synergy could survive his departure - that it wasn\u2019t just based on what he called \u201cthe human factor\u201d. Even so, his successor will face questions about whether to invest money in increasing the company\u2019s cross-shareholdings in order to cement the relationships, or risk the alliance falling apart. He or she may also be under pressure to show how the alliance can stop Tesla and GM from eroding its early lead in electric vehicles - and how the somewhat sporadic recent investment in mobility and connected car technology can be harnessed to help the alliance as a whole.\u201d</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5bf2a19ce4b0bb700a72fd3b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-11-19T12:08:38.350Z\">12.08pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Economics professor Thomas Piketty (an expert in inequality) has tweeted that Ghosn\u2019s alleged misconduct shows the perils of granting top bosses pay \u201cwithout limits\u201d....</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/PikettyLeMonde/status/1064478487489204224\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"fr\" dir=\"ltr\">Voici \u00e0 quoi conduit l&#39;id\u00e9ologie des premiers de cord\u00e9e et des r\u00e9mun\u00e9rations sans limite...

He\u2019s known for a ferocious work ethic, and charismatic leadership style that has helped him to turn Nissan and Renault around over the last two decades</p> <p>He was initially known as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/1999/oct/24/observerbusiness.theobserver7\">a \u2018cost-killer\u2019 in the 1990s, cutting tens of thousands of jobs and closing factories in Japan and Europe</a>.</p> <p>That made him understandably unpopular, but over time his reputation in Japan swelled as Nissan returned to profitability. The Nissan-Renault alliance now makes one in nine cars sold worldwide.</p> <p>As Fortune magazine wrote in 2014, the Brazilian-Lebanese-French business chief was seemingly indispensable:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Ghosn seems to be built for the job: He has the ability to connect with strangers instantly and to compartmentalize, no discernible private life outside his family, and a willingness to travel 300,000 miles a year (that\u2019s 11 circumnavigations).</p> <p>The question is, Who will run this leviathan, which he calls the Renault-Nissan Alliance, after the 60-year-old retires, or if, God forbid, something happens to him?</p> <p> It is such a demanding, bone-crunching job that Ghosn himself has said that after he leaves no one person should replace him. In fact, on numerous occasions he has said to a close former colleague: \u201cWho would want this job?\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>He was even paid the rare accolade of having his face represented in sushi, in a \u201cCarlos Ghosn bento lunchbox\u201d.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/530603e4-0de3-11db-a385-0000779e2340\">The FT explained</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It is a measure of the extraordinary rise of Mr Ghosn in Japan that he should be deemed worthy enough to eat. The Japanese take their food seriously and do not welcome foreign intrusions.

      "bodyText": "The latest annual state account figures released late last week by the bureau of statistics show that Victoria is the strongest overall performing state and that generally all states grew well in the 2017-18 financial year. But the figures also highlight the ongoing problem of flat income growth with most states showing either falling or barely any growth in real household income for the past six years. Unlike the national GDP figures, the gross state product figures are released only annually, and as such they help provide a broader picture of the economy than we get in the quarterly GDP figures. In the quarterly national figures the broadest measure we get of states\u2019 economic performance is the \u201cstate final demand\u201d figure, which excludes exports and imports and can hide a great deal of what is going on. This is especially so in the case of Western Australia. Its falling state final demand since 2012-13 had some suggesting it was in a recession, whereas when trade is included it is clear that its economy has actually grown since then: But as state final demand focuses on aspects such as consumption, investment and government spending, a case could be made that for most inhabitants of a state \u2013 especially its workers \u2013 final demand is more important than gross state product \u2013 especially if the export income is flowing mostly to company profits rather than wages. However, that aside the latest figures confirm the other economic data that Victoria has been doing well and that New South Wales is slowing. But while Victoria did record the fastest economic growth of any state in 2017-18, a large part of it was due to the increase in its population. As I recently noted, Victoria had seen a boom of people moving there from interstate. That helps increase the overall GSP growth rate, but not the GSP per capita rate. And on that measure, Victoria in 2017-18 was just below the national average, while NSW was bringing up the rear: Having the worst performing state economy is not the greatest story for the NSW government to tell going into an election year, and a big part of the blame is the slowing housing market. The contribution of dwelling construction to NSW\u2019s economic growth in 2017-18 was the lowest it has been for six years: Victoria, Queensland and the Australian Capital Territory also saw a slowing of the contribution of dwelling construction, while South Australia saw a small improvement. The last financial year saw a slowing of per capita economic growth in NSW, Victoria and South Australia, while Western Australia recovered after a disastrous 2016-17. Overall Northern Territory (whose annual growth is very large and erratic) saw a slight slowing of growth. For Western Australia, exports are key \u2013 they export around 43% of all goods from Australia \u2013 and while NSW dominates the services export sector, that accounts for only around a quarter of the value of goods exports, so WA remains the biggest overall state for exports: As a result the importance of exports to that state\u2019s economy vastly outweighs any other state. In 2017-18, exports contributed 2.3% points to WA\u2019s state economic growth compared to just 0.5% points for NSW. But given 41% of NSW\u2019s exports are services-related compared to just 4% of WA\u2019s the employment impact of exports from our most populous state is more important to its economy than in WA. But whether or not we should look at gross state product or state final demand to judge the performance of a state\u2019s economy can be a bit of an economic wood-for-the-trees type argument. Fortunately the annual state accounts figures also give us the household disposable income figures, which allow us to get to the crux of the matter. It ultimately matters little if GSP or final demand are growing well, but households are not benefiting. Across the nation, the ACT and Northern Territory have the highest per capita household disposable income. But this is due to their relatively small populations and large proportion of government and military workers. In the Northern Territory the per capita figures certainly hide the massive levels of poverty and are thus not truly reflective of the experience of a majority of people in the territory: As we have seen repeatedly with the quarterly national account figures, household incomes on average in Australia have not increased in real terms since 2011. And the news from the state-based figures is not good either. Households in NSW, Victoria, Queensland and Western Australia have a lower per capita income in real terms than they did in 2011-12: The improvements in disposable income in South Australia and Tasmania mostly occurred in 2014-15 and since then their incomes have also been as flat as elsewhere in the country. The state account figures provide some nice depth to the quarterly GDP figures, but they also serve to reinforce the national picture \u2013 an economy growing solidly with exports taking off, but where households continue to see flat or falling living standards. And no state, regardless of dependence upon exports, housing or services, has been immune. \u2022 Greg Jericho is a Guardian Australia columnist",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Carlos Ghosn was, until Monday, a titan of the global car industry. The first person to lead two Fortune 500 companies at the same time, he also enjoyed an almost unique position as a foreign chief executive of a major Japanese company \u2013 even gaining the honour of a manga comic book version of his life and rice sculptures of his face in bento lunchboxes sold to Japanese businessmen. Yet in a remarkable development which has shocked the automotive industry, Ghosn will now be dismissed by Nissan on Thursday after alleged financial irregularities. Nissan did not hold back in its statement on Ghosn, accusing him and a senior colleague of \u201csignificant acts of misconduct\u201d including understating his pay to regulators and misusing company assets. Renault and Mitsubishi Motors, both of which Ghosn also chairs, have yet to respond. The ousting leaves the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi alliance \u2013 the maker of one in every nine cars manufactured worldwide last year \u2013 without its totemic leader as the electric and autonomous car revolutions threaten to upend the business models of established car manufacturers. Born in Brazil in 1954 to Lebanese immigrants, Ghosn\u2019s ascent to the pinnacle of the global car industry began in France, where he studied at the prestigious \u00c9cole Polytechnique in Paris before joining Michelin, the French tyre manufacturer. At 27 he was manager of a Michelin factory in France; at 36 he was chief executive of the firm\u2019s North American operations. In 1996 Ghosn (which rhymes with \u201ccone\u201d) was poached by Renault, where he made his mark with a deep restructuring \u2013 earning a reputation for a sleek but ruthless management style, and a nickname, \u201cLe Cost Killer\u201d. He repeated the trick at Nissan after Renault took a 43.4% stake in 1999, slashing employee numbers but gaining a heroic reputation in Japan for the rapid turnaround. Mitsubishi, dented by a fuel economy fixing scandal, joined the alliance in 2016, creating the world\u2019s top-selling passenger car manufacturer through linked shareholdings. Yet Ghosn provoked ire as he gained the superstar salary to match. In 2016 he lost a vote on pay as the French government, a major shareholder, objected to a \u20ac7.4m (\u00a36.6m) package. He also earned a 735m Japanese yen (\u00a35m) salary from Nissan and 227m Japanese yen from Mitsubishi for the year ending in March 2018, according to annual filings. Another pay vote at Renault this year narrowly passed, lessening some of the pressure on Ghosn as he was thought to be exploring a full merger between Renault and Nissan. But thoughts of simplifying the unorthodox structure are now likely to take a backseat as the remaining executives deal with a plunging share price and start a long overdue hunt for a successor to one of the world\u2019s most prominent businessmen.",

Renault and Mitsubishi Motors, both of which Ghosn also chairs, have yet to respond.</p> <p>The ousting leaves the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi alliance \u2013 the maker of one in every nine cars manufactured worldwide last year \u2013 without its totemic leader as the electric and autonomous car revolutions threaten to upend the business models of established car manufacturers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/nov/2018-11-19T17:09:40/embed.html\" data-alt=\"carmakers compared\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/nov/2018-11-19T17:09:40/embed.html\">carmakers compared</a> </figure> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/nov/19/nissan-renault-carlos-ghosn-arrest-shares\">Nissan Renault chief Carlos Ghosn faces arrest in Japan</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Born in Brazil in 1954 to Lebanese immigrants, Ghosn\u2019s ascent to the pinnacle of the global car industry began in France, where he studied at the prestigious \u00c9cole Polytechnique in Paris before joining Michelin, the French tyre manufacturer. At 27 he was manager of a Michelin factory in France; at 36 he was chief executive of the firm\u2019s North American operations.</p> <p>In 1996 Ghosn (which rhymes with \u201ccone\u201d) was poached by Renault, where he made his mark with a deep restructuring \u2013 earning a reputation for a sleek but ruthless management style, and a nickname, \u201cLe Cost Killer\u201d.</p> <p>He repeated the trick at Nissan after Renault took a 43.4% stake in 1999, slashing employee numbers but gaining a heroic reputation in Japan for the rapid turnaround. Mitsubishi, dented by a fuel economy fixing scandal, joined the alliance in 2016, creating the world\u2019s top-selling passenger car manufacturer through linked shareholdings.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Business email signup\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yet Ghosn provoked ire as he gained the superstar salary to match. In 2016 he lost a vote on pay as the French government, a major shareholder, objected to a \u20ac7.4m (\u00a36.6m) package. He also earned a 735m Japanese yen (\u00a35m) salary from Nissan and 227m Japanese yen from Mitsubishi for the year ending in March 2018, according to annual filings.</p> <p>Another pay vote at Renault this year narrowly passed, lessening some of the pressure on Ghosn as he was thought to be exploring a full merger between Renault and Nissan.</p> <p>But thoughts of simplifying the unorthodox structure are now likely to take a backseat as the remaining executives deal with a plunging share price and start a long overdue hunt for a successor to one of the world\u2019s most prominent businessmen.</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "TSB has poached a senior figure from Clydesdale and Yorkshire Bank owner CYBG for its new chief executive, as the troubled bank seeks to draw a line under an IT meltdown that cost it \u00a3250m and thousands of lost customers. Debbie Crosbie, the chief operating officer at CYBG, is tasked with helping TSB recover its reputation from a botched IT platform migration in April that locked nearly 1.9 million customers out of their accounts. TSB\u2019s executive chairman, Richard Meddings, who took over in September after the chief executive Paul Pester paid the price for a faltering response to the IT failure, said TSB will have recovered from the fiasco by the time Crosbie, 48, joins next year. \u201cWhat I expect is that by the end of this year we will have put this behind us. We\u2019ll look back at 2018 and recognise it as a really difficult and challenging year,\u201d he said, adding that the TSB brand \u201cremains strong\u201d. \u201cIt was clearly bruised but it wasn\u2019t fractured,\u201d Meddings said. Pester initially resisted pressure to quit despite a stinging rebuke from the Financial Conduct Authority over the IT upgrade, but finally stepped down in September as TSB admitted criticism of the bank\u2019s boss had become a distraction. TSB had been working to move accounts from an IT system inherited from its previous owner, Lloyds Banking Group, to one owned and created by its new Spanish owner Sabadell. TSB has spent about \u00a3250m so far working to remedy the problems \u2013 including hiring 600 extra staff to handle complaints \u2013 and expects further costs in the fourth quarter. It also lost about 45,000 customers, who ditched the troubled bank by switching their accounts to other lenders between April and September. But during the same period, about 42,000 customers either opened a new account or switched to TSB. The bank is still working on some IT fixes, but Meddings said TSB was nearly out of the woods and was now ready to launch new products \u2013 including a new business banking service \u2013 for the first time since April. \u201cAlthough we still see occasional IT issues and interruptions, the number of these incidents is significantly down and now in line with the wider industry,\u201d Meddings said. More than 118,000 complaints have now been \u201cfully resolved\u201d. One analyst said Crosbie, a Scot who joined CYGB in 1997, came with a strong reputation. John Cronin, analyst at stockbroker Goodbody, said Crosbie \u201cis the type of appointment that was required to rebuild the reputational damage caused as a result of its own botched migration on to the Sabadell platform.\u201d He noted that Crosbie was instrumental in developing CYBG\u2019s new operating platform following its stock market debut, as well as the migration of 2 million customers from its \u201cpre-existing archaic underinvested platform\u201d. \u201cPretty useful experience in the context of TSB\u2019s own migration issues,\u201d Cronin said. \u201cShe comes across as a strong leader who doesn\u2019t beat about the bush and is not afraid to challenge and confront issues head on in a very measured manner,\u201d Cronin said. TSB would not divulge Crosbie\u2019s remuneration, but said her basic salary will be higher than the \u00a3913,500 taken home by her predecessor. That is more than double the base salary offered in her current role at CYBG \u2013 which was \u00a3450,000 last year \u2013 and is only slightly lower than her total remuneration of \u00a3929,000 for 2017, according to CYBG\u2019s annual report. TSB\u2019s business banking service launch will put Crosbie in healthy competition with her former employer. The lender is planning to bid for a portion of a \u00a3775m cash pot from Royal Bank of Scotland meant to boost business banking competition in the UK. The cash \u2013 which is being distributed by an independent body \u2013 is linked to RBS\u2019s \u00a345bn billion government bailout at the height of the financial crisis. Fellow challenger banks, including digital lender Starling, Metro Bank and Crosbie\u2019s current employer CYBG are preparing rival bids.",

The Deal or No Deal star has also pledged to use a portion of any gains from the pending lawsuit to fund a charity for banking victims. Edmonds\u2019 lawyers are expected to serve Lloyds Bank with a pre-case letter this Wednesday, although the formal claim may not be filed until early December. Lloyds Bank said: \u201cWe are still waiting for Mr Edmonds to file his legal claim. If he does file his claim, it will be contested\u200e.\u201d Edmonds is expected to seek about \u00a360m in damages over claims that his firm, Unique Group, was pushed into failure by fraudsters at the Reading branch of HBOS, which Lloyds acquired at the height of the financial crisis. HBOS Reading bankers have since been jailed over the \u00a3245m loans scam in which financiers spent the cash on prostitutes and holidays. A Lloyds Banking Group spokesman said: \u201cWe continue to make good progress compensating the approximately 70 customers impacted by the fraud at the HBOS Impaired Assets office based in Reading. We have now provided outcomes to more than 95% of customers in the review and more than 90% of these offers have been accepted.\u201d The bank has set aside \u00a3100m to compensate HBOS Reading victims. It said this year it had \u201csought to reach a resolution with Mr Edmonds through mediation \u2026 but this was not possible.\u201d Edmonds said: \u201cI think the chances of a negotiated settlement are very, very slim, and I suspect that their very expensive lawyers will try and drag this out now for the next couple of years. But I\u2019m up to it and I know that we are going to win in court. I have the damning evidence.\u201d He added that he wants to help people navigate the litigation options and financial support systems that could help bolster their cases. The charity won\u2019t provide direct funding for lawsuits itself, but will aim to offer \u201cintelligence and contacts\u201d. \u201cThis will be a one-stop shop for those who believe they are victims of banking criminality and we will help them to process and progress their claim,\u201d he said. Edmonds told the Guardian he has already lodged an application with the Charity Commission to register his White Horse Trust \u2013 a reference to Lloyds, which is known as the Black Horse bank. The Noel\u2019s House Party star has been laying the groundwork for his legal case for more than a year and a half. \u201cOver this period I have learned a huge amount about the way in which the banking system operates, how they deal with people who have legitimate complaints,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to pass on that knowledge to other people so that they know the best lawyers, the best solicitors, the best media to talk to, and the best way in which they can formulate their claim so that it is more likely to be resolved.\u201d Edmonds is aware of questions surrounding delays to his lawsuit, but said new information has now been gathered from individuals including the convicted HBOS Reading banker Michael Bancroft, who is serving 10 years in prison. \u201cI\u2019m not saying that I\u2019m anything other than aghast at what Bancroft did to people, but he does seem very anxious now to make up for it. And he provided some very important information which then delayed our submission.\u201d The TV star added: \u201cWhen my case is settled I\u2019m not going to ride off into the sunset and forget about this.

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s battered high streets will take another pounding this week with retail experts predicting that the Black Friday phenomenon will push even more shoppers online and slash footfall during the crucial pre-Christmas sales period. The Springboard group, which tracks shopper numbers at 4,500 locations across the UK, said it expects footfall will drop by 3.7% compared with Black Friday 2017, and by 2.7% over the weekend as a whole. Black Friday, a day of pre-Christmas discounting borrowed from the US, is officially on 23 November, but Amazon has already begun its sales campaign. Along with other internet-based retailers, it has helped to turn Black Friday into a near fortnight-long \u00a310bn shopping extravaganza, largely online. Springboard said it expects online transactions to rise by 4% for this year\u2019s Black Friday, although this is a lower pace of growth than recorded on Black Friday last year. There are also signs that shoppers may be reaching exhaustion over Black Friday, partly because of squeezed incomes, but also because of a growing belief that the \u201cbargains\u201d offered may not be as attractive as they look. Springboard anticipates that in the Saturday and Sunday after Black Friday, sales will fall by 5% compared with last year. \u201cPressure on spending and reduced disposable income will be further compounded by the fact that Black Friday is taking place a week earlier this year, meaning that many consumers will not be paid until the week after, possibly forcing them to delay spending or rely on credit, which is already at its highest level since 2007,\u201d said Springboard. Shoppers are now accustomed to heavy discounting \u201calmost continuously throughout the year, together with the widespread debate around whether Black Friday discounts are discounts at all\u201d, it added. Nine out of 10 Black Friday products are cheaper at other times of the year, according to separate research by price comparison site idealo.co.uk. It analysed prices of 21,047 products over a 12-month period and found that only laptops were offered at genuine bargain prices. Smartphones are the most popular purchase on Black Friday, said Idealo, but they were on average \u00a372 cheaper on 5 August. One of this year\u2019s most popular new category of consumer electronics, drones, were typically \u00a3149 cheaper at the end of September. Katy Phillips of Idealo said: \u201cMany shoppers naturally believe the hype surrounding Black Friday and are seduced by the big-ticket deals. However, our advice is to stay savvy all year round.\u201d Some retailers now regard Black Friday as counter-productive, forcing them into discounting at a time when they traditionally made most of their annual profits. Diane Wehrle of Springboard, said: \u201cWhatever happens on Black Friday, our data over the past few years has established that it brings Christmas spending forward. This creates a magnet of spending activity at the beginning the peak trading period which then suppresses spending until the final week before Christmas.\u201d",
