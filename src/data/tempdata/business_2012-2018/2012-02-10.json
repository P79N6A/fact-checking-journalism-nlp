    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Greek government appeared increasingly shaky on Friday night as its junior partner, the populist Laos party, said it would not support a controversial \u20ac130bn (\u00a3108bn) loan agreement for the crisis-hit country and several senior ministers resigned. Reflecting mistrust between debt-stricken Athens and its foreign lenders, the party said the mission chief from the International Monetary Fund, Poul Thomsen, one of the accord's chief architects, should instead be declared \"persona non grata\". \"We are not going to vote [the package] through,\" said the Laos leader, Georgios Karatzaferis, ahead of Sunday's make-or-break parliamentary vote on the deeply unpopular wage, pension and job cuts in the deal sponsored by the EU and IMF. Far from rescuing Greece from bankruptcy, the draconian conditions attached to the financial lifeline would doom it to further poverty, he insisted. \"What has particularly bothered me is the humiliation of the country,\" he said referring to the refusal of foreign creditors, in particular Germany, to part with any funds before Greece found ways of saving a further \u20ac325m, despite the agreement being sealed. Athens has six weeks to find \u20ac14.5bn to cover loans it must repay in March. \"Clearly Greece can't and shouldn't do without the European Union but it could do without the German boot,\" said Karatzaferis, an unabashed nationalist. \"If we want things to go forward, Poul Thomsen must be declared persona non grata for Greece.\" Tonight the Greek cabinet endorsed the controversial loan agreement but it is Sunday's vote that will cement Athens' future in the eurozone. Despite waning patience with Greece in Europe, Karatzaferis said the entire EU was suffering under Germany's hegemony. \"Germany decides for Europe because it has a fat wallet and with that fat wallet it rules over the lives of all the southern countries,\" he said. \"Decisions aren't taken in Brussels but from a tower in Berlin from where Merkel co-operates with her satellite countries, the Netherlands, Austria, Finland and unfortunately also Luxembourg.\" The extraordinary outburst intensified the political uncertainty engulfing Athens. The technocrat prime minister, Lucas Papademos, was appointed to the helm of a \"national unity\" government in November to arrange the bailout. Laos's decision to break ranks and withdraw support exacerbated the economic deadlock and sense of mounting confusion in the capital after days of wrangling over the deal. Papademos began the arduous task of reassembling his cabinet after several ministers stepped down in anger over the austerity measures. Four Laos deputies in his government also tendered their resignation. Popular fury over the belt tightening spilled onto the streets again as a mass demonstration erupted into running battles between riot police and protesters, and a 48-hour strike shut down the country for a second time this week. Recalcitrant MPs, in interviews on radio and TV, voiced ambivalence over the conditions attached to the rescue package saying they were as bad as bankruptcy. Several leading parliamentarians questioned whether, in good conscience, they could endorse the rescue package. \"If we accept them we'll be setting in motion the bankruptcy of our country,\" said Odysseus Boudouris, an MP with the socialist Pasok. \"Bankruptcy will be bad for Greece but it will also be bad for Europe, too.\" Austerity measures over the past two years, including a barrage of tax rises and wage and pension cuts, have plunged Greece into its worst recession since the second world war. Unemployment exceeded one million this week, hitting a record 20.9%. Manufacturing has all but collapsed with many companies moving across the border into Albania and Bulgaria. Announcing her resignation as deputy foreign minister for European affairs, Mariliza Xenoyiannakopoulou, a Pasok stalwart, captured the rising panic among Greece's political class. \"Unfortunately the troika and the institutions which it represents have not taken into account the lessons [gleaned] from the first memorandum,\" she said, referring to the bailout Greece received from the EU, ECB and IMF in May 2010. \"Because, beyond the weaknesses and delays there have been in implementing corrective changes, they [the troika] are attempting to impose measures which ultimately will dramatically increase the recession and push society into ever greater despair.\" The coalition government and the political parties backing it had come under intense pressure to put their commitment in writing to the cost-cutting demanded in return for rescue funds. The latest bailout agreement also contains a private sector bond swap that will slice \u20ac100bn from the country's \u20ac350bn debt pile in the hope of bringing it down to 120% of GDP by 2020. Ahead of general elections possibly as early as April, Karatzaferis, whose popularity has plummeted since Laos joined the government, and Antonis Samaras, who leads the conservative New Democracy party, have balked at doing so. Late on Friday it remained unclear whether Samaras, whose popularity has shot up on the back of fervent opposition to the fiscal remedies, would sign the loan deal. With anti-German sentiment rising in Greece, it was yet another case of political posturing in the debt drama.",

First Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio, the chief executive of Lloyds Banking Group, decided to waive his 2011 bonus, followed by Stephen Hester at the Royal Bank of Scotland and Sir David Higgins at Network Rail. All three organisations are wholly or partly dependent on the taxpayer \u2013 and Hester and Higgins were under intense political pressure to forgo their money \u2013 but on Thursday, when Tom Albanese, the boss of London-listed mining group Rio Tinto, waived his bonus too, questions were being asked about whether such sacrifices had spread well beyond the public sector.</p> <p>Except that Albanese waived his bonus for a very specific reason: a takeover had not gone as planned \u2013 the bid for aluminium producer Alcan \u2013 and forced the company to take a $9.3bn (\u00a36bn) charge. Rio, which incurred pay protests from shareholders in 2010 and 2011, was no doubt mindful of the risk of another protest at an annual meeting \u2013 as evidenced by remarks from Ivor Pether, senior fund manager at Royal London Asset Management on Friday, who hit out against the remuneration committee, which sets bonuses. \"The onus should really be on this committee to exercise its discretion and withhold bonus awards when there is deemed to be strong justification for doing so, rather than relying on the integrity of the executives to step up to the plate,\" said Pether.</p> <p>And attempts by Barclays to demonstrate pay restraint on Friday \u2013 arguing that bonuses were down 48% for executives and its eight highest-paid employees \u2013 also backfired.</p> <p>But according to the Treasury, shrinking bonuses are a trend. The City bonus pool is forecast to be \u00a34.2bn for 2011-12, compared with \u00a36.7bn in 2010-11 and \u00a311.6bn in 2007-08. And as part of Project Merlin \u2013 the \"armistice\" between the government and the banks that traded promises on tax stability for assurances on pay and lending \u2013 banks agreed to show \"responsibility\" and to make bonus arrangements more transparent.</p> <p>\"We are not going back to the days when bankers received bonuses worth hundreds of thousands of pounds in cash when no one knew what risks they were taking,\" says a Treasury source.</p> <p>The Treasury is not the only institution claiming some of the credit for bonus restraint. \"We believe that the work that Compass, and the work that the high pay commission did, have transformed the national debate,\" says Gavin Hayes, general secretary of Compass, a leftwing pressure group that used to be better known for its idealism than its influence in the corridors of Whitehall. But Compass set up the independent high pay commission, which published a report last year. Clegg praised it lavishly and many of its recommendations were accepted when Vince Cable, the business secretary, announced plans to control executive pay last month. \"The High Pay Commission has set a direction of travel that all the parties have, in one form or another, adopted,\" says Hayes.</p> <p>Up to a point. Ed Miliband, who claims ownership of the \"responsible capitalism\" agenda, has accepted all 12 of the commission's conclusions and has criticised Cable for not backing its call for workers to be included on remuneration committees.</p> <p>In a speech this weekGeorge Osborne, the chancellor, took a veiled swipe at Labour by attacking those \"trying to create an anti-business culture in Britain\". Miliband retaliated on Thursday, after Downing Street said it would not be commenting on the forthcoming Barclays bonus payments, by saying: \"Some argue that it is not business of the public what bonuses banks pay. I fundamentally disagree.\"</p> <p>But Labour and the government have both put transparency at the heart of their strategy for curbing bonuses and some believe the gap between the two sides on this is rather narrow. \"It's more a difference of rhetoric,\" said one expert in this area at a big City organisation who asked not to be named. \"Clearly there nuances where the policy is different, such as whether you have employees on remuneration committees, but in my view that's the type of measure that would not make much difference.\"</p> <p>Project Merlin may have done something to curb bonus payments, but even at the Treasury, sources admit that City firms are also responding to public pressure. \"In the past 18 months attitudes to executive pay have hardened, because people now recognise what a difficult economic environment we are in,\" says Deborah Hargreaves, the former Guardian journalist who chaired the high pay commission. She cites recent research showing that only 7% of people think that a FTSE 100 chief executive should be paid more than \u00a31m a year; in fact, the average is \u00a34m.</p> <p>In the City this has not gone unnoticed. \"I think everyone is aware of the sensitivities around pay at the moment,\" says Robert Talbut, chief investment officer at Royal London Asset Management and chairman of the investment committee at the Association of British Insurers, whose member companies are major stock market investors. He thinks attitudes to bonuses are changing for good.</p> <p>\"While some may take the view that is temporary, others believe this as a permanent change in the environment. Some people are hoping that improving economic growth and markets will cause everyone to forget about it. I think this is an incorrect view and that remuneration is going to remain a sensitive topic which has the potential to continue to damage the standing of companies,\" says Talbut.</p> <p>Others are more sceptical. \"What has undoubtedly changed is public perception,\" says Roger Barker, head of corporate governance at the Institute of Directors, which last year said that the reputation of British business was \"significantly damaged\" by pay packages not linked to performance. \"It was public opinion that put pressure on [people like Hester]. But whether the underlying attitudes of executives who are working in these large companies have changed is as yet unascertained,\" he says.</p> <p>John Philpott, chief economic adviser of the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, is also cautious. \"There is nothing in the system about preventing a return to [business as usual]. There doesn't seem to be any political momentum for that to change. I don't see anything in the proposals that the government is bringing forward, as they are still talking misguidedly about pay being related to performance.\"</p> <p>Philpott says that after the banking crisis of 2008 the markets were hit by \"doom and gloom about the end of capitalism\". But soon there was a return to business as usual, with the phrase \"BAB\" \u2013 bonuses are back \u2013 soon echoing through the City.</p> <p>Cable suggested he was accepting 10 out of 12 of the commission's recommendations, but many he accepted only \"in spirit\". Hargreaves says that the three core proposals \u2013 dramatic simplification of pay, workers on remuneration committees and a permanent high pay commission \u2013 were ignored. \"We still think there's some way to go,\" she says.</p> <p>The coalition promised to tackle \"unacceptable\" bonuses. But what's \"unacceptable\" still remains undefined.</p>",

Clegg praised it lavishly and many of its recommendations were accepted when Vince Cable, the business secretary, announced plans to control executive pay last month. \"The High Pay Commission has set a direction of travel that all the parties have, in one form or another, adopted,\" says Hayes. Up to a point. Ed Miliband, who claims ownership of the \"responsible capitalism\" agenda, has accepted all 12 of the commission's conclusions and has criticised Cable for not backing its call for workers to be included on remuneration committees. In a speech this weekGeorge Osborne, the chancellor, took a veiled swipe at Labour by attacking those \"trying to create an anti-business culture in Britain\". Miliband retaliated on Thursday, after Downing Street said it would not be commenting on the forthcoming Barclays bonus payments, by saying: \"Some argue that it is not business of the public what bonuses banks pay. I fundamentally disagree.\" But Labour and the government have both put transparency at the heart of their strategy for curbing bonuses and some believe the gap between the two sides on this is rather narrow. \"It's more a difference of rhetoric,\" said one expert in this area at a big City organisation who asked not to be named. \"Clearly there nuances where the policy is different, such as whether you have employees on remuneration committees, but in my view that's the type of measure that would not make much difference.\" Project Merlin may have done something to curb bonus payments, but even at the Treasury, sources admit that City firms are also responding to public pressure. \"In the past 18 months attitudes to executive pay have hardened, because people now recognise what a difficult economic environment we are in,\" says Deborah Hargreaves, the former Guardian journalist who chaired the high pay commission. She cites recent research showing that only 7% of people think that a FTSE 100 chief executive should be paid more than \u00a31m a year; in fact, the average is \u00a34m. In the City this has not gone unnoticed. \"I think everyone is aware of the sensitivities around pay at the moment,\" says Robert Talbut, chief investment officer at Royal London Asset Management and chairman of the investment committee at the Association of British Insurers, whose member companies are major stock market investors. He thinks attitudes to bonuses are changing for good. \"While some may take the view that is temporary, others believe this as a permanent change in the environment. Some people are hoping that improving economic growth and markets will cause everyone to forget about it. I think this is an incorrect view and that remuneration is going to remain a sensitive topic which has the potential to continue to damage the standing of companies,\" says Talbut. Others are more sceptical. \"What has undoubtedly changed is public perception,\" says Roger Barker, head of corporate governance at the Institute of Directors, which last year said that the reputation of British business was \"significantly damaged\" by pay packages not linked to performance. \"It was public opinion that put pressure on [people like Hester]. But whether the underlying attitudes of executives who are working in these large companies have changed is as yet unascertained,\" he says. John Philpott, chief economic adviser of the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, is also cautious. \"There is nothing in the system about preventing a return to [business as usual]. There doesn't seem to be any political momentum for that to change. I don't see anything in the proposals that the government is bringing forward, as they are still talking misguidedly about pay being related to performance.\" Philpott says that after the banking crisis of 2008 the markets were hit by \"doom and gloom about the end of capitalism\". But soon there was a return to business as usual, with the phrase \"BAB\" \u2013 bonuses are back \u2013 soon echoing through the City. Cable suggested he was accepting 10 out of 12 of the commission's recommendations, but many he accepted only \"in spirit\". Hargreaves says that the three core proposals \u2013 dramatic simplification of pay, workers on remuneration committees and a permanent high pay commission \u2013 were ignored. \"We still think there's some way to go,\" she says. The coalition promised to tackle \"unacceptable\" bonuses. But what's \"unacceptable\" still remains undefined.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Barclays bank is on a collision course with its shareholders despite insisting it has taken strong steps to show pay restraint at its Barclays Capital investment bank. As the bank reported a 3% fall in profits to \u00a35.9bn, major shareholders were considering whether to summon the bank's top executives, led by Bob Diamond, to explain the scale of the payouts at BarCap \u2013 where the average pay of the 24,000 bankers was some \u00a3200,000. The shareholders may even vote against the remuneration report, or even some directors, at the annual general meeting in April. In the face of political pressure on bonuses following the furore surrounding the near-\u00a31m bonus for the Royal Bank of Scotland's chief executive, Stephen Hester, Diamond said it was important to \"celebrate rewards for success or then we won't have an economy\". \"We need to be comfortable in this country talking about growth, growth, growth. Business, business, business. Jobs, jobs, jobs. Economy, economy, economy. And I think if we don't recognise the need to shift the mantle of growth from the public sector to the private sector, if we don't recognise that every time a leader talks about eradicating reward for failure they also talk about celebrating reward for success, then we won't have an economy,\" he said. The size of Diamond's bonus will not be revealed until next month when the bank's annual report is published. However, a claim by the bank that the average pay of the top eight highest-paid bankers and the executive team was down 48% led to speculation that the chief executive's payout was between \u00a3900,000 and \u00a33m. Ahead of the bank reporting season, which kicked off with Barclays on Friday, one shareholder body, the Association of British Insurers, had written to banks to urge pay restraint \u2013 and held meetings with bank bosses themselves. After learning that as a percentage of BarCap's profits, the bonus pool was 35% (against 36% a year ago), Robert Talbut, chairman of the ABI's investment committee, said on Friday there had been no step change at Barclays: \"Whilst overall bonus levels at Barclays have been reduced, for Barclays Capital this reduction is only in line with the fall in profit before tax. \"This appears to be very close to business as usual. It is not the signal of the change required in order to improve the investment case.\" Diamond had tried to head off a row with shareholders by capping cash bonuses at \u00a365,000 even though he admitted the returns to shareholders were \"unacceptable\". Targets he set only last year \u2013 to produce a return on equity (a crucial measure of performance used by shareholders) of 13% by 2013 \u2013 are now likely to be missed as the bank's returns were just 6.6% in 2011, down on 2010's 6.8%. Diamond shrugged off the ABI's unexpected criticism, saying: \"We stay close with our shareholders and they are very supportive.\" Providing more detail about bonuses than usual, the bank said the average bonus across the bank was down 21% year on year to \u00a315,200, while the average bonus at BarCap was down 30% to \u00a364,000 \u2013 just below the cap. Last year the average bonus was \u00a391,000. In 2010 Barclays doubled the base salaries of its investment banking staff to combat restrictions on bonuses. But the shareholder advisory group Pirc questioned whether the bank's assertion that it intended to pay out \u00a32bn in deferred bonuses in the future was allowing the bank to flatter its performance. Unions were also unimpressed. The TUC general secretary, Brendan Barber \u2013 who wants bonuses taxed \u2013 said that the payouts proved that \"City bonuses have nothing to do with rewards for success\". Diamond again stressed the bank's commitment to \"citizenship\" and repeatedly refused to disclose whether he had been offered a bonus, what the size of it might be and whether he intended to take it. The chairman, Marcus Agius, also refused to disclose the size of the payouts. The bank also admitted it paid only \"a relatively small amount\" of UK corporation tax. While the bank stressed that in 2011 bonuses were down 26% across the group and down 35% at BarCap compared with 2010, the proportion of revenue used to pay BarCap's staff actually rose to 47% from 43% a year ago. Revenue inside BarCap \u2013 which Diamond used to run until being elevated to chief executive a year ago \u2013 was down 22% and profits in that operation down 32%. \"Very weak BarCap revenues do most of the damage today,\" said Ian Gordon, banks analyst at Investec. On a volatile day, the shares closed at 234p, up just 1p. The bonus pool in BarCap was down 32% to \u00a31.5bn \u2013 but the World Development Movement noted this would pay for school meals for two years for the \"23 million primary-age children who attend school hungry across Africa\". About 20% of the profits generated by the bank \u2013 \u00a31.3bn \u2013 were generated in Africa. The total bonus pool for the bank's 141,000 staff was down 25% to \u00a32.1bn - more than twice the \u00a3700m being used to pay a 6p dividend to shareholders. Cash bonuses at the bailed-out banks Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group, where neither boss is taking a bonus, are subjected to a \u00a32,000 cap. Diamond said the mood towards the bank ing industry was \"not a positive\" but said, of the move to cut bonuses, that \"we need to balance remaining competitive with being responsive to the public mood.\" BarCap, despite the 32% fall in profits, was still the biggest single contributor to profits at \u00a32.9bn, while profits were dented by a \u00a31.7bn impairment in the bank's stake in BlackRock, which bought the Barclays Global Investors fund management business in 2009, and a \u00a3427m goodwill impairment in Spain and restructuring charges there of \u00a3189m.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Unions have called on Britain's biggest high street chains to withdraw from government programmes that make the unemployed work for up to six months unpaid or face losing their benefits. The call comes as Sainsbury's, one of the UK's largest retailers, confirmed to the Guardian that it has stopped branch managers from taking on jobseekers under the work experience scheme. The move follows that of Waterstones book chain, which last week announced it had pulled out of the scheme because it did not want to \"encourage work for no pay\". Under the work experience scheme, hundreds of thousands of largely young jobseekers will work in charities and private businesses for 30 hours a week, for eight weeks, without pay, and can have their benefits removed if they withdraw. The government has also introduced a plethora of other schemes, such as mandatory work activity, sector-based work academies, and the community action programme, which can force jobseekers to take unpaid work for up to six months as a condition of their benefits. The schemes are in operation at more than a dozen well-known chains, such as Boots, Tesco, Asda, Primark, Argos, TK Maxx, Poundland and the Arcadia group of stores run by billionaire Sir Philip Green, which includes Top Shop and Burton. Shopworkers union Usdaw, which represents more than 400,000 workers in high street retail outlets, said it was currently in discussion with a number of major companies about their involvement. John Hannett, Usdaw general secretary, said: \"Usdaw is not opposed to schemes that genuinely aim to give young people appropriate work experience or help long-term unemployed people get back into work, but schemes should be voluntary, participants should receive the rate for the job, and there needs to be transparent checks and balances in place. \"We are in discussions with the participating companies we have agreements with to re-examine their continuing involvement in the [\u2026] various schemes.\" Hannett added: \"The unemployment crisis is never going to be solved by forcing people to work for nothing. What the country needs is a proper strategy for jobs and growth.\" The TUC called for companies to pull out and warned that the government-mandated schemes were encouraging more unpaid work rather than creating actual jobs. TUC general secretary Brendan Barber said: \"While unemployed people may benefit from short periods of work experience, forcing them to work effectively for free for up to six months is not the way to solve the UK's jobs crisis. \"Not only are the high street names involved [\u2026] in danger of exploiting participants, the scheme also poses a very real threat to the jobs and pay of existing workers. It is also far from clear whether the placements actually involve any genuine degree of training or work experience that will be of any use to the unemployed taking part. \"The danger is that [this] is simply encouraging employers to continue using unpaid labour when what they should be doing is recruiting unemployed people into properly paid jobs.\" Solicitors from Public Interest Lawyers in Birmingham this week issued letters to the heads of 15 companies to make them aware of legal proceedings they have lodged in the high court challenging the legality of such schemes. Their client, geology graduate Cait Reilly, is currently arguing in the high court that she was made to work unpaid in Poundland, contrary to the forced labour provisions in the Human Rights Act. Phil Shiner from Public Interest Lawyers said he welcomed the withdrawal of major high street chains from \"exploitative\" programmes. \"Some major companies are now waking up and turning their backs on compulsory unpaid labour schemes. We have written to a number of major retailers involved in work-for-your-benefit schemes and asked them whether they intend to continue in light of what the Guardian has reported and we have brought to the attention of the courts. \"Whilst our legal actions are against the Department of Work and Pensions, these household brands bear their own moral and social responsibility to ensure that they have nothing to do with these exploitative and ill-judged programmes.\" Sainsbury's, which has more than 1,000 stores in the UK, says it only now participates in the work trial programme, in which people work a maximum of 16 hours a week for four weeks in an actual job vacancy, and can pull out at any point without sanction. Sainsbury's stressed that the work trials were \"entirely voluntary\" and, unlike work experience schemes, \"candidates did not lose their benefits if they didn't participate\". The supermarket added that it had taken on 4,300 employees through the scheme. Defending its continued participation in schemes that have elements of compulsion, Tesco said: \"We take our responsibility as Britain's biggest private sector employer seriously and are playing our part to help tackle unemployment in these challenging times.\" Tesco said that over the last four months around 1,400 people had worked for free for a month as part of work experience in its stores, and since the scheme began 300 jobseekers had gained a job with the company.",

      "body": "<p>Struggling <strong>Cable &amp; Wireless Communications</strong> slumped nearly 17% after it warned its full year results would not meet expectations.</p> <p>The company said its business in Panama was facing increased competition and lower demand from corporate clients, and its earnings there would be around $254m rather than the $270m-$295m it had been anticipating. It also had problems in Jamaica, and planned to write down the value of that business in its full year figures.</p> <p>The news sent its shares tumbling 7.24p to 36.33p. In a sell note Rory Stokes at Liberum Capital said:</p> <blockquote> [A recent] refinancing has bought breathing space, but the very low cash generation of this business and the structural pressures it faces makes the net debt position look daunting and the dividend precarious. </blockquote> <p>After remaining remarkably steady during much of the week, despite the escalating Greek crisis, the market came close to giving up the struggle yesterday afternoon. The <strong>FTSE 100</strong> finished 43.08 points lower at 5852.39, a 50 point drop on the week. Angus Campbell, head of sales at Capital Spreads, said:</p> <blockquote> The FTSE has spent all week going sideways until today and this little break to the downside shows technical weakness over the near term. Further weakness in the coming days cannot be ruled out, especially if the vote in Greece this week end does not get passed. </blockquote> <p>Mining shares were among the leading fallers, both on the eurozone's economic problems as well as renewed worries about a slowdown in China, a key market for commodity companies.</p> <p>According to the country's latest trade date, imports fell 15.3% year on year in January, raising new concerns about the state of its economy. In particular, copper imports dropped 18.7%.</p> <p>So despite the takeover developments in the sector - Glencore and Xstrata - investors are taking the cautious view. <strong>Anglo American</strong> dropped 113.5p to 2746.5p, <strong>Kazakhmys</strong> fell 53p to \u00a311.24 and <strong>BHP Billiton</strong> lost 57.5p to 2057.5p.</p> <p><strong>Icap</strong> lost 14.8p to 366.6p after Goldman Sachs downgraded the interdealer broker from buy to neutral.

      "bodyText": "Struggling Cable &amp; Wireless Communications slumped nearly 17% after it warned its full year results would not meet expectations. The company said its business in Panama was facing increased competition and lower demand from corporate clients, and its earnings there would be around $254m rather than the $270m-$295m it had been anticipating. It also had problems in Jamaica, and planned to write down the value of that business in its full year figures. The news sent its shares tumbling 7.24p to 36.33p. In a sell note Rory Stokes at Liberum Capital said: [A recent] refinancing has bought breathing space, but the very low cash generation of this business and the structural pressures it faces makes the net debt position look daunting and the dividend precarious. After remaining remarkably steady during much of the week, despite the escalating Greek crisis, the market came close to giving up the struggle yesterday afternoon. The FTSE 100 finished 43.08 points lower at 5852.39, a 50 point drop on the week. Angus Campbell, head of sales at Capital Spreads, said: The FTSE has spent all week going sideways until today and this little break to the downside shows technical weakness over the near term. Further weakness in the coming days cannot be ruled out, especially if the vote in Greece this week end does not get passed. Mining shares were among the leading fallers, both on the eurozone's economic problems as well as renewed worries about a slowdown in China, a key market for commodity companies. According to the country's latest trade date, imports fell 15.3% year on year in January, raising new concerns about the state of its economy. In particular, copper imports dropped 18.7%. So despite the takeover developments in the sector - Glencore and Xstrata - investors are taking the cautious view. Anglo American dropped 113.5p to 2746.5p, Kazakhmys fell 53p to \u00a311.24 and BHP Billiton lost 57.5p to 2057.5p. Icap lost 14.8p to 366.6p after Goldman Sachs downgraded the interdealer broker from buy to neutral. At the same time the bank raised its recommendation on asset manager Schroders from neutral to buy, but this was little help and Schroders dropped 54p to \u00a315.96. Goldman said: Against a backdrop of continued bank deleveraging and restructuring, regulatory flux and declining volatility, we believe the outlook for market structure firms remains opaque.

The outlook for the European asset managers appears promising in comparison, with stabilizing markets, a recovery in asset flows and a benign regulatory backdrop all conducive to building confidence in the sub-sector's future earnings generation. Icap's smaller rival Tullett Prebon also came under pressure, down 17.8p to 310.7p. Aviva fell 8.7p to 361.3p on reports the insurer has postponed a potential sale of its stake in its loss-making Taiwan joint venture, because of regulatory disapproval. Elsewhere Next added 14p to \u00a327.33 after Deutsche Bank analysts raised their recommendation from hold to buy and their target price from \u00a328.25 to \u00a331: We expect another steady year of earnings per share growth and attractive total shareholder return. Morrisons edged up 0.1p to 290.7p on reports the supermarket group planned 300 local convenience stores after the successful trial of the first three such outlets.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "While debate continues to rage in the UK about bonuses, and bank bosses defend their payouts, their counterparts in Spain are taking a rather more pragmatic and popular approach Rodrigo Rato's position as a former boss of the International Monetary Fund and now one of Spain's senior bankers would normally put him among Europe's highest-paid financiers. But then his bank took money from the taxpayer so Rato has agreed to have his executive chairman's salary at the Bankia group slashed by three-quarters. His \u20ac2.34m (\u00a31.95m) package will be cut to \u20ac600,000. The cut has been ordered by the new conservative People's party government of Mariano Rajoy, which is clamping down on pay to bankers who have had to seek help from the state. \"Naturally, I will obey,\" said Rato, who heads Spain's third-biggest lender. Bankia's number two, Francisco Verd\u00fa, will also see his salary reduced to \u20ac600,000 from \u20ac2.2m. Non-executive directors will be limited to \u20ac100,000. \"Bankia and all of us who work in it will, of course, comply with any government decision,\" said Rato, who is also a former PP finance minister. Where the Spanish government has nationalised or part-nationalised a bank \u2013 as happened with Britain's Lloyds TSB or the Royal Bank of Scotland \u2013 the salary cuts are even greater. The upper limit for these banks is \u20ac300,000, with non-executive directors capped at \u20ac50,000. That will be a blow to Adolf Tod\u00f3, head of the CatalunyaCaixa savings bank, and Jordi Mestre of Unnim. Their wages are \u20ac1.55m and \u20ac960,000 respectively. The measures announced by the finance minister, Luis de Guindos, will hurt a handful of senior bankers, but have been widely approved of by Spaniards. \"We are asking society as a whole for sacrifices and those of us who have most should set an example,\" De Guindos, former banker who once worked for Rato, told El Pa\u00eds newspaper. Bankia received a \u20ac4.5bn loan from the Spanish government's FROB bank restructuring fund, which has been used to support consolidation and part-nationalisation of banks. CatalunyaCaixa and Unnim were both nationalised as they sank under the weight of toxic property loans. The salary measure was part of a fresh round of banking reform earlier this month when De Guindos ordered Spanish banks to put aside some \u20ac50bn for bad loans and write-downs on toxic real estate. This will bring further consolidation and more use of FROB money. The fact that the measure was passed by De Guindos rather than his socialist predecessor, Elena Salgado, has raised eyebrows. Spain's leading political blogger, Ignacio Escolar, said: \"She made a feint at capping these salaries but her plans never came to fruition.\" He noted that the head of a bank rescued by taxpayers would still earn 10 times the average wage. \"In one year they will earn as much as someone on the minimum wage will get in their life, if they work for 33 years.\" Rajoy has also raised income tax, especially for higher earners, and come out in support of the financial transactions tax introduced by the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy. He took over the reins of government in December from Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero's socialists.",

If the Germans, and the other hardliners, are trying to force the issue it is because they believe that the actions taken by the European Central Bank over the past couple of months have been sufficient to ensure no contagion effects from Greece to the other debt-stricken eurozone members and, just as importantly, to the fragile European banking system.

      "bodyText": "Would a boss who describes his firm's financial returns as \"unacceptable\" then accept a bonus? In the case of Bob Diamond, we'll have to wait to find out. The Barclays chief executive is refusing to talk about his own rewards on the day of the bank's annual results. Those results, however, are dominated by a single statistic: a return on shareholders' equity of 6.6% for 2011, down from 6.8% last year. That outcome is miles away from Diamond's target of 13% by 2013. Indeed, the man himself concedes the race is as good as lost already. The target has been downgraded to an aspiration \"over time\". Most investors regarded the 13%-by-2013 goal as hot air anyway, which is why the market has not reacted badly to Diamond's admission: Barclays share price is up 2%. All the same, the returns figure raises a straightforward question: if these targets are to be meaningful, shouldn't the failure to meet them be reflected in the boss's bonus? One assumes it will be since Barclays' pay report last year specifically mentioned return on equity as one of the \"key financial metrics\" that would determine bonuses for executive directors. But until the numbers are published in the annual report, one can't know for certain. Today's reticence looks evasive.

But, come on, that assumes you started from the right place. Nobody, surely, would claim that. Barclays outshone RBS and Lloyds and others during the big banking blow-up, but that's nothing to boast about. Barclays is still a bank that is not even close to earning returns in excess of its cost of capital. This is now the third year in a row of sub-par returns.

Yes, but another reason is Barclays unwillingness, or inability, to make the cultural shift to align properly the rewards of employees at Barclays Capital, the bank's biggest engine, with the prosperity of Barclays shareholders. Diamond cites the need to remain competitive \u2013 and claims his shareholders are supportive. But here's news for you, Bob: some of your big investors are revolting. Robert Talbut, chairman of the investment committee at the Association of British Insurers (and thus an influential voice), says: \"Whilst overall bonus levels at Barclays have been reduced, for Barclays Capital, this reduction is only in line with the fall in profit before tax.

This would leave households under pressure, and potentially defy the Bank of England's prediction that inflation could even fall too low this year.</p> <p>Inflation at the factory gate eased to 4.1% in January from 4.8% the month before, the Office for National Statistics said. That was, however, slightly above a forecast of 3.7% and economists predicted that so-called producer price inflation could now start to prove \"sticky\" and fail to come down enough to ease wider inflation in the economy.</p> <p>Producers' input price inflation meanwhile dropped markedly to 7% from 8.9%, the slowest pace for more than two years. But that too was not quite as low as the 6.7% rate expected by City economists.</p> <p>The Bank of England forecasts that price pressures in the economy will ease throughout this year. Policymakers said on Thursday that they feared inflation, currently double its 2% government-set target, would even below this by the end of the year and that they were therefore stepping in with more electronic cash. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/feb/09/bank-of-england-announces-more-quantitative-easing\" title=\"\">They announced \u00a350bn more in quantitative easing against the backdrop of a flagging economy</a>.</p> <p>But economists said the Bank may yet be proved wrong on inflation, especially given a recent jump in oil prices.</p> <p>\"This latest sign of stickiness reaffirms my feeling that consumer price inflation (CPI) will prove higher than most, including the Bank of England expects,\" said Alan Clarke, economist at Scotiabank. \"So while CPI inflation is likely to fall to around 2% by September, that is probably as low as it will go in my view.\"</p> <p>Separately, the ONS said the construction industry suffered a 0.5% fall in output in the final three months of 2011, compared with the previous quarter. That was driven by a drop in output in five out of construction's nine sectors. Infrastructure, which covers projects such as railway line construction and motorway improvements, outperformed, however. Output for infrastructure rose 4% on the quarter to its highest level since comparable records began in 1980.</p> <p>A record year for infrastructure work also helped drive a 2.8% rise in construction industry output for 2011 as a whole. There was also support from a rise in new public housing output to the highest level since 1980.</p> <p>Construction makes up just 7.6% of the UK economy and statisticians had already estimated last month that its output dropped 0.5% in the final quarter of 2011. The latest data therefore had no bearing on the ONS estimate that overall GDP fell 0.2% in the fourth quarter.</p>",

This would leave households under pressure, and potentially defy the Bank of England's prediction that inflation could even fall too low this year. Inflation at the factory gate eased to 4.1% in January from 4.8% the month before, the Office for National Statistics said. That was, however, slightly above a forecast of 3.7% and economists predicted that so-called producer price inflation could now start to prove \"sticky\" and fail to come down enough to ease wider inflation in the economy. Producers' input price inflation meanwhile dropped markedly to 7% from 8.9%, the slowest pace for more than two years. But that too was not quite as low as the 6.7% rate expected by City economists. The Bank of England forecasts that price pressures in the economy will ease throughout this year. Policymakers said on Thursday that they feared inflation, currently double its 2% government-set target, would even below this by the end of the year and that they were therefore stepping in with more electronic cash. They announced \u00a350bn more in quantitative easing against the backdrop of a flagging economy. But economists said the Bank may yet be proved wrong on inflation, especially given a recent jump in oil prices. \"This latest sign of stickiness reaffirms my feeling that consumer price inflation (CPI) will prove higher than most, including the Bank of England expects,\" said Alan Clarke, economist at Scotiabank. \"So while CPI inflation is likely to fall to around 2% by September, that is probably as low as it will go in my view.\" Separately, the ONS said the construction industry suffered a 0.5% fall in output in the final three months of 2011, compared with the previous quarter. That was driven by a drop in output in five out of construction's nine sectors. Infrastructure, which covers projects such as railway line construction and motorway improvements, outperformed, however. Output for infrastructure rose 4% on the quarter to its highest level since comparable records began in 1980. A record year for infrastructure work also helped drive a 2.8% rise in construction industry output for 2011 as a whole. There was also support from a rise in new public housing output to the highest level since 1980. Construction makes up just 7.6% of the UK economy and statisticians had already estimated last month that its output dropped 0.5% in the final quarter of 2011. The latest data therefore had no bearing on the ONS estimate that overall GDP fell 0.2% in the fourth quarter.",
