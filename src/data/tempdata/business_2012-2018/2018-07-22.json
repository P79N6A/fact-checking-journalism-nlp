      "bodyText": "United Utilities is to pay out nearly \u00a3181m in dividends just two days before the water company implements a hosepipe ban across the north-west of England. The payout on 3 August will be the company\u2019s single biggest in a decade and will mean shareholders have received close to \u00a3271m for the last financial year, 2.2% more than for the previous 12 months. The FTSE 100-listed company is under fire as it prepares to limit water usage for 7m homes and seeks a permit to draw water from Ullswater and Windermere in the Lake District. The company cited \u201cexceptional shortage of rainfall\u201d and a surge in usage during the prolonged hot weather. United is not alone in making big payouts to shareholders. Severn Trent, which faced criticism from farmers over shortages in Derbyshire last month, paid \u00a3122.2m in dividends on 20 July, taking its total for the year to \u00a3204.5m, up from \u00a3191.6m a year before despite a near 8% fall in pre-tax profits. Pennon Group, the owner of South West Water, is to pay out \u00a3111.8m on 4 September, bringing its total dividends for the year to \u00a3162m, up from \u00a3149m last year. The company said it had not imposed water restrictions since 1996 and had reduced leakages by 40% over that time. A spokesperson for United Utilities said: \u201cWe deliver a range of benefits and long-term value for customers, the environment, and shareholders ... Between 2015 and 2020 , we are investing over \u00a33.5bn in essential infrastructure.\u201d Cat Hobbs, the director of the campaign group We Own It, which campaigns for public ownership of utilities including water companies, said: \u201cThis shows exactly what\u2019s wrong with the water industry. Dividends to shareholders have been prioritised over investment in infrastructure we all need.\u201d Jim McMahon, the Labour MP for Oldham West and Royton, said: \u201cThis isn\u2019t just about water leaking out but money which should be used to maintain the water network leaking out as quickly. The first and last responsibility of the water company should be about maintaining the supply, and it has failed.\u201d Thames Water suspended dividend payments to investors last year, saying the money would instead be spent on long-term investment plans such as getting its leakage target back on track and on its water and waste treatment plants. The change in policy came after 10 years in which about \u00a31.2bn was taken out of the company in the form of dividends. Its owner over that period, the Australian investment bank Macquarie, sold its final stake in 2017, landing Thames with more than \u00a310bn of debt financing. Last month, the water industry regulator demanded Severn Trent, Southern Water, South East Water and Thames Water submit detailed plans by 28 September that outlined how they would improve service for customers during difficult weather conditions. Ofwat set the deadline after a review found tens of thousands of customers had water supplies cut for days during the \u201cbeast from the east\u201d weather events earlier this year. The report criticised poor advance planning, inadequate communication with customers and a lack of basic support during the cold snap. The regulator said it would take further action against any water company that provided an unsatisfactory response. Responding to the imminent payout to United Utilities shareholders, a spokesperson for Ofwat said: \u201cThe decisions some water companies have made on dividends, financial structures and top executive pay have damaged customer trust. We have looked in detail at the incentives we give water companies. Through measures we announced earlier this month, we are strengthening the incentive on companies to improve their performance for customers and cutting the rewards that come from financial engineering.\u201d It said it had asked the companies to cut down on leakage by 170bn litres a year, enough to meet the yearly needs of everyone in the cities of Birmingham, Leeds, Manchester, Liverpool and Cardiff combined. According to the Consumer Council for Water, United lost just over 133 litres per property a day in 2017, a fall from 138 litres the previous year but still making the company the second biggest offender in the UK behind Thames Water.",

      "bodyText": "Australian governments are experiencing a surge in revenue that will be undermined by a slowdown in China and a \u201cmini-credit crunch\u201d as banks tighten lending standards, Deloitte Access Economics has said. In its June quarter Business Outlook report Deloitte suggests rising global interest rates are combining with a bout of bank caution on lending that will accelerate falling house prices. But despite high power prices and falling wealth, the principal of Deloitte, Chris Richardson, points to income tax cuts and a slow recovery in wages to suggest Australia\u2019s outlook remains \u201cgood without being great\u201d. Full-time job gains have \u201cbeen great\u201d and although job growth is easing, continued falls to unemployment will \u201cdrive more growth in the size of workers\u2019 pay packets\u201d, he said. The report suggests that average earnings will increase from 1.4% in 2017-18 to 2% this year, rising to 3.4% in 2022-23. \u201cThe wage recovery has begun, but it\u2019s still a case of watching paint dry,\u201d Richardson said. Inflation is also on the rise but \u201cbut not much, and not fast\u201d. The consumer price index is expected to increase from 1.9% in 2017-18 to 2.2% this year. Despite the rise in inflation, the \u201cmini-credit crunch\u201d caused by tighter lending standards means the the Reserve Bank won\u2019t be raising the official interest rate \u201cuntil mid-2019 at best and possibly even later still\u201d, Richardson said. Deloitte forecasts GDP growth of 2.8% last year will rise to 3.2% next year before falling back to 2.9% in 2019-2020 and 2020-21. The Deloitte report says government revenue is surging off the back of company tax and state stamp duties. But it warns \u201cChina\u2019s slowdown will slowly seep into commodity prices, winding back profit-driven boosts to federal revenues, while a mini-credit crunch will sound the death knell for the east coast stamp duty bonanza.\u201d Noting the federal government has cut personal income tax cut \u2013 at a cost of $144bn \u2013 Richardson concludes that Australia \u201chas repeated an old mistake: spending a temporary revenue boom on permanent promises\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019d prefer to see the budget in better health before any such promises were made.\u201d Richardson said the first phase of the income tax plan \u201cmerely hands back what bracket creep otherwise adds to the tax take\u201d and does little to change the relative share that low, middle or high-income earners pay. The shadow treasurer, Chris Bowen, seized on the report, which he said was a \u201cdevastating critique\u201d of the Turnbull government\u2019s \u201cnever-never tax cut plan\u201d. \u201cLocking in long-term tax cuts when there\u2019s already half a trillion in gross debt and no one knows what the global or domestic economic backdrop will be in four or six years time is sheer madness,\u201d he said. \u201cBy 2025, the combined fiscal impact of big business tax cuts and stage three of the income tax cuts is about $25bn year. \u201cThe Liberal party\u2019s unfunded tax cut plans mean more pressure on debt and a stronger likelihood of further cuts to schools and hospitals over the next decade.\u201d The Coalition is yet to legislate the corporate tax cut for companies earning $50m or more a year. In June it was forced to shelve the bill because it still needs four more votes from the group of six crossbench senators in Pauline Hanson\u2019s One Nation, Centre Alliance, and independents Tim Storer and Derryn Hinch. Centre Alliance\u2019s Rex Patrick told Guardian Australia its position was unchanged \u2013 it currently opposes the cut but \u201cwould be open\u201d to it if the government can guarantee revenues and not to cut health, welfare and education in the next four years. He noted that the latest \u201cunexpected changes in tax receipts\u201d have been positive which was \u201chelpful to the government\u2019s argument that they are moving towards surplus and the deficit is under control\u201d. In noting risks to growth, the Deloitte Access Economics report warned Australia was adding the equivalent of Canberra to its population every year but \u201cdelivering less infrastructure than we need, with a resultant impact on our quality of life\u201d. \u201cIf this nation keeps failing to deliver a matching lift in our infrastructure, then the politics of population growth in Australia will grow ever more toxic,\u201d it said. \u201cIf so, the nation\u2019s immigration intake will be cut \u2013 perhaps severely \u2013 thereby undercutting many of the most likely forecasts underpinning the growth of domestic markets in the forecasts.\u201d The Turnbull government has so far maintained its support for an immigration cap of 190,000 permanent migrants a year despite the home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, and former prime minister Tony Abbott advocating a cut. But Dutton has released figures that show a fall of more than 20,000 migrants to a decade-low of 162,417 due a crackdown by his department, leading business leaders to warn of low growth and labour shortages.",

      "bodyText": "Tesco is preparing to launch a new discount chain as early as September, as the supermarket ramps up its battle with the discounters Aldi and Lidl. Retail insiders say Tesco may name the chain Jack\u2019s after a division of the grocery group recently attempted to register the name as a retail trademark. It was reported on Sunday that up to 60 stores could be launched by the UK\u2019s biggest retailer. The retailer is advertising for staff for a new format in Immingham, Lincolnshire, and Chatteris, Cambridgeshire, both mothballed sites Tesco has sat on for about four years, as well as in Wandsworth, south London. The company has confirmed that a medium-sized Tesco Metro in St Helens in Merseyside will reopen under a new name while the Guardian understands workers at a Tesco Metro in Edge Hill, Liverpool, which is set to close, have also been promised potential jobs at a new store set to open within five weeks. Online job ads for some of the sites state: \u201cThe new retail format will be operated separately from the core Tesco business and as such benefits offered will be different from those offered at Tesco.\u201d Workers at closing Tesco Metro stores are being made redundant and have to reapply for the new jobs. Bryan Roberts, an analyst at the retail marketing firm TCC Global, said: \u201cIf Tesco puts some proper welly behind it in terms of infrastructure and store openings it could stand a decent chance of success.\u201d Tesco executives have been combing through thousands of potential sites to examine which might be appropriate, according to the Mail on Sunday, which reported that up to 60 could be transformed initially. Traditional supermarkets have been searching for a way to get into the fast-growing discount market, having seen the German rivals Aldi and Lidl win over their shoppers since the last recession, when rising food prices encouraged Britons to shop around for their groceries. The discounters\u2019 smaller, locally based stores are also cashing in on a shift towards buying less but more often, as driving to large, out-of-town stores for a weekly or fortnightly big shop falls out of fashion. As well as Aldi and Lidl, general discounters including B&amp;M, Wilko and Poundland have also increased the amount of food they sell, stealing sales away from traditional chains. Sainsbury\u2019s partnered up with the Danish chain Netto in 2014 to launch a UK discounter, but the venture closed its 16 stores two years later after struggling to make a profit. Tesco last tried the discount route in the 1980s \u2013 under the Victor Value brand \u2013 but the move was abandoned after four years because the management team at the time feared it might undermine the main brand. Aldi and Lidl now control nearly 13% of the grocery market, according to Kantar Worldpanel data, compared with less than 9% four years ago. They are increasing sales by more than 8% a year while sales at the big four supermarkets \u2013 Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s, Asda and Morrisons \u2013 are barely keeping pace with the rising price of food. Rumours have been circling about Tesco developing a discount chain since it promised shareholders in February that it would \u201cdevelop new formats to better serve customers\u201d. It was said to have drafted in Lawrence Harvey, a former Aldi executive, to help develop the concept and sought advice from Boston Consulting Group. It asked a number of key own-label suppliers to sign non-disclosure agreements before contributing to a new project. The new format is also a key part of its acquisition of Booker, the UK\u2019s biggest wholesaler, which has prompted rumours that the stores might be more akin to Costco, the cash-and-carry business. Tesco has already tried stocking bulk-buy items from the Bookers range in its stores. Roberts said the size of the stores Tesco was looking at converting and its note to potential job applicants that they would be part of a small team, suggested a discounter or pared-down format similar to Colruyt in Belgium, which is a hybrid between a cash-and-carry and a discounter. Tesco declined to comment on the potential new format.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Take a walk through King\u2019s Cross station most days of the week, and you will see a crowd of people gathered among the usual rush of commuters and weary travellers awaiting the umpteenth delayed London-to-Leeds service. This isn\u2019t the complaints queue for cancellations. These people have travelled from further afield than Bradford \u2013 from South Korea, the US , France and Germany \u2013 to wait for a train that doesn\u2019t even exist. Having started as a humble homage to the Harry Potter books, the gap between platforms nine and 10has developed into one of the biggest tourist attractions in the capital. Alongside the plaque marking the fictional platform 9\u00be and the luggage trolley stuck halfway into the wall, there is a gift shop and professional photographer. There are always queues. This is a lucrative combination of capitalism and the human imagination. As a metaphor for the future of the British economy, the boy wizard created by JK Rowling and the queues for the Hogwarts Express are apt. Advanced economies around the world are increasingly moving away from producing tangible goods to become more adept at creating intangible value \u2013 through branding, intellectual property and computer software \u2013 of the kind exemplified by the Harry Potter franchise. Once upon a time wealth was defined by physical assets. Nowadays companies like Amazon and Google rank as among the most valuable in the world despite making very little of physical worth. Herein lies the problem for Britain. Besides figuring out how to tax the seemingly magical profits of the internet firms, the rise of the intangible economy poses the UK with two tough questions. First, there is the problem with measurement. At the end of next month, Jonathan Haskel, an expert in intangible economics at Imperial College, will become a member of the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee to help Threadneedle Street better understand the challenges ahead. Answering questions from the Treasury select committee last month before his appointment, he used the example of Harry Potter as a \u201cbundle of intangible assets\u201d, telling MPs: \u201cIt is the creative copyright from the book. It is the software that goes into the movie. It is the branding. It is the set design that gives you all these gothic decorations that you see in the film, in the play and that kind of thing. There is a whole bundle of intangible assets. The economy is moving much more in that direction.\u201d Haskel has written a book on the subject, Capitalism Without Capital, to explain the challenges. Principal among them is measuring the gains for the economy from things that cannot be held firmly by hand. Google\u2019s chief economist, Hal Varian, takes this further, pointing out that about 80bn photographs were taken all over the world at the turn of the millennium, at a cost of approximately 50 cents (38p) each using a traditional camera. By 2015, smartphones enabled as many as 1.6tn photographs to be taken for free. While GDP \u2013 the universal economic measure of expenditure, production and earnings \u2013 should rise with economic progress, it fails to capture this shift. The loss in terms of foregone production and sales of cameras actually means GDP goes the other way. The economists Erik Brynjolfsson, Felix Eggers and Avinash Gannamaneni have tried to measure the value of free digital goods and have come up with staggering results. Overall, they say, our use of search engines, email and other products like social media and digital maps should cost as much as $25,700 (\u00a319,560) a year per typical internet user if it was not free. This is yet more value missing in action from the modern economy. Some monetary policy hawks argue higher interest rates are required because the economy may be performing better than the figures, missing these elements, appear to suggest. But they would be wrong to believe Britain is perfectly placed to benefit from the intangible economy. There are many things holding back its development. Which brings us to the second point in the debate about intangibles: finance. Like the Dementors in Rowling\u2019s books, the banking industry acts to sap the vitality of the intangible economy. Most economists agree the big thing needed in Britain is greater levels of investment, particularly as Brexit discourages firms from spending. But there are significant barriers for borrowing to invest in intangible assets from the current financial setup. In the UK, banks favour lending for property over and above loans to other areas. After the financial crisis, they demanded greater security for lending. Regulators at the Bank of England have pushed them in this direction, too. Safety first, so the story goes, lest the crash reoccurs. But banks could do more, rather than simply crawling over one another to lend against physical collateral \u2013 such as a home, or a factory or piece of machinery for a business. Our economy suffers as a consequence, with inflated house prices and not enough being lent to new businesses. Getting a loan for an investment in area where the banks cannot demand security in exchange is much more difficult. It ought not to be, in the right circumstances. It\u2019s an issue latched on to by the Labour party with zeal. It argues that the Royal Bank of Scotland should be fully nationalised, and then broken up into a network of community banks in order to spur greater levels of productive lending to small businesses trying to tap into this new economic future. This may be unrealistic, given the changes at RBS and its gradual return to the private sector in recent years, with the latest sale of shares in June making it even harder for Labour to take control if in government. But Labour does have a point, and find unusual favour in the form of the Bank of England\u2019s chief economist. Although not referring to Labour\u2019s plans, Andy Haldane used a speech last month to point to the network of regional banks in Germany, known as the Sparkassen, as one way the German economy is better suited for developing its intangible economy. Labour\u2019s regional network of banks would be similar in design. There are also institutions dedicated to the better diffusion of new ideas into the business community. The Fraunhofer research societies help thousands of companies each year to develop new ideas. The same task is carried out by the Steinbeis Foundation, which helps transfer academic findings into the field of business. Some of this German thinking would help Britain progress. Haldane points to them both as ways to improve UKproductivity, which has been lingering in the doldrums and delaying wage growth since the financial crisis. The UK has many things in its favour. English laws protecting intellectual property rights are among the most renowned in the world, encouraging innovation. The government\u2019s industrial strategy is also providing greater funding for infrastructure, skills and training, while also spending more public money on research and development. But not enough is being done. Business leaders are desperate for a greater vision. Government ministers may be cautious about the idea of picking winners, but they ought to remember this is really about picking the winning economic model for the future. Do the Conservatives and the banks want to be on the side of Potter, or impeding progress?",

This is a lucrative combination of capitalism and the human imagination.</p> <p>As a metaphor for the future of the British economy, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jun/26/twenty-years-of-harry-potter-the-20-things-we-have-learned\">the boy wizard created by JK Rowling</a> and the queues for the Hogwarts Express are apt.</p> <p>Advanced economies around the world are increasingly moving away from producing tangible goods to become more adept at creating intangible value \u2013 through branding, intellectual property and computer software \u2013 of the kind exemplified by the Harry Potter franchise. Once upon a time wealth was defined by physical assets. Nowadays companies like <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/10/is-amazon-founder-jeff-bezos-the-richest-person-ever\">Amazon</a> and Google rank as among the most valuable in the world despite making very little of physical worth.</p> <p>Herein lies the problem for Britain. Besides figuring out how to tax the seemingly magical profits of the internet firms, the rise of the intangible economy poses the UK with two tough questions.</p> <p>First, there is the problem with measurement. At the end of next month, Jonathan Haskel, an expert in intangible economics at Imperial College, will become a member of the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee to help Threadneedle Street better understand the challenges ahead.</p> <p>Answering questions from the Treasury select committee last month before his appointment, he used the example of Harry Potter as a \u201cbundle of intangible assets\u201d, telling MPs: \u201cIt is the creative copyright from the book. It is the software that goes into the movie. It is the branding. It is the set design that gives you all these gothic decorations that you see in the film, in the play and that kind of thing. There is a whole bundle of intangible assets. The economy is moving much more in that direction.\u201d</p> <p>Haskel has written a book on the subject, Capitalism Without Capital, to explain the challenges. Principal among them is measuring the gains for the economy from things that cannot be held firmly by hand.</p> <p>Google\u2019s chief economist, Hal Varian, takes this further, pointing out that about 80bn photographs were taken all over the world at the turn of the millennium, at a cost of approximately 50 cents (38p) each using a traditional camera. By 2015, smartphones enabled as many as 1.6tn photographs to be taken for free. While GDP \u2013 the universal economic measure of expenditure, production and earnings \u2013 should rise with economic progress, it fails to capture this shift. The loss in terms of foregone production and sales of cameras actually means GDP goes the other way.</p> <p>The economists Erik Brynjolfsson, Felix Eggers and Avinash Gannamaneni have tried to measure the value of free digital goods and have come up with staggering results. Overall, they say, our use of search engines, email and other products like social media and digital maps should cost as much as $25,700 (\u00a319,560) a year per typical internet user if it was not free. This is yet more value missing in action from the modern economy.</p> <p>Some monetary policy hawks argue higher interest rates are required because the economy may be performing better than the figures, missing these elements, appear to suggest. But they would be wrong to believe Britain is perfectly placed to benefit from the intangible economy. There are many things holding back its development. Which brings us to the second point in the debate about intangibles: finance.</p> <p>Like the Dementors in Rowling\u2019s books, the banking industry acts to sap the vitality of the intangible economy. Most economists agree the big thing needed in Britain is greater levels of investment, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/21/brexit-blamed-for-dramatic-fall-in-uk-business-registrations\">particularly as Brexit discourages firms from spending</a>. But there are significant barriers for borrowing to invest in intangible assets from the current financial setup.</p> <p>In the UK, banks favour lending for property over and above loans to other areas. After the financial crisis, they demanded greater security for lending. Regulators at the Bank of England have pushed them in this direction, too. Safety first, so the story goes, lest the crash reoccurs.</p> <p>But banks could do more, rather than simply crawling over one another to lend against physical collateral \u2013 such as a home, or a factory or piece of machinery for a business. Our economy suffers as a consequence, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/apr/09/uk-march-house-prices-post-biggest-monthly-increase-for-six-months\">with inflated house prices</a> and not enough being lent to new businesses. </p> <p>Getting a loan for an investment in area where the banks cannot demand security in exchange is much more difficult. It ought not to be, in the right circumstances. It\u2019s an issue latched on to by the Labour party with zeal. It <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2018/jun/19/john-mcdonnells-ambition-is-fine-but-he-needs-to-avoid-statism\">argues that the Royal Bank of Scotland should be fully nationalised</a>, and then broken up into a network of community banks in order to spur greater levels of productive lending to small businesses trying to tap into this new economic future. This may be unrealistic, given the changes at RBS and its gradual return to the private sector in recent years, with the latest sale of shares in June making it even harder for Labour to take control if in government.</p> <p>But Labour does have a point, and find unusual favour in the form of the Bank of England\u2019s chief economist. Although not referring to Labour\u2019s plans, Andy Haldane used a speech last month to point to the network of regional banks in Germany, known as the Sparkassen, as one way the German economy is better suited for developing its intangible economy. Labour\u2019s regional network of banks would be similar in design.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Guardian business email sign-up\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>There are also institutions dedicated to the better diffusion of new ideas into the business community.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.fraunhofer.de/en.html\">Fraunhofer research societies</a> help thousands of companies each year to develop new ideas. The same task is carried out by the <a href=\"https://www.steinbeis-iec.de/en/steinbeis/\">Steinbeis Foundation</a>, which helps transfer academic findings into the field of business. Some of this German thinking would help Britain progress. Haldane points to them both as ways to improve UKproductivity, which has been lingering in the doldrums and delaying wage growth since the financial crisis. </p> <p>The UK has many things in its favour. English laws protecting intellectual property rights are among the most renowned in the world, encouraging innovation. The government\u2019s industrial strategy is also providing greater funding for infrastructure, skills and training, while also spending more public money on research and development. But not enough is being done. Business leaders are desperate for a greater vision.</p> <p>Government ministers may be cautious about the idea of picking winners, but they ought to remember this is really about picking the winning economic model for the future. Do the Conservatives and the banks want to be on the side of Potter, or impeding progress?</p>",

What could go wrong selling sexy lingerie to millions of women? A lot, it seems. Last week, Victoria\u2019s Secret\u2019s Ohio-based parent L Brands reported an unexpected drop in June comparable sales for its lingerie brand, despite a lengthy semi-annual sale and deep price cuts. Apparel and retail analysts pounced. \u201cIt\u2019s game over\u201d for Victoria\u2019s Secret and Pink, Jefferies analyst Randal Konik said in a note. Consumers have moved on to more conventional brands like American Eagles\u2019 Aerie brand, while Victoria\u2019s Secret has seen \u201cmassive traffic declines, zero pricing power and market share losses mounting\u201d, Konik continued. Konik concluded that investors have been ignoring the facts and L Brands stock dropped 11%. It is now down 40% for the year. It suddenly seemed the company secret, masked by growth in the company\u2019s teen-focused Pink line, was no longer well hidden. Victoria\u2019s Secret is still the No 1 US lingerie brand, but its share of the market is slipping. To make matters worse, many of Victoria\u2019s Secret 1,200 stores in the US and Canada are located in America\u2019s beleaugured mall system, widely seen as on the decline. \u201cI used to come here for the Pink line but now I go to Macy\u2019s,\u201d confided Yvonne Rayder, 32, from New Jersey, pulling out underwear items in the Herald Square store as she prepared for a hen party she was attending. \u201cTheir bras are ridiculously expensive, along with the rest of the lingerie.\u201d Rayder\u2019s comments conform to industry surveys. A September 2017 consumer study conducted by Wells Fargo found that of 48% of customers who had shopped at Victoria\u2019s Secret in the past year, 58% said prices were too high. Crucially, the study found, Victoria\u2019s Secret also \u201cmay be falling out of favor\u201d, with 68% of respondents saying they like the brand less than they used to. More than half of those said the brand feels \u201cforced\u201d or \u201cfake\u201d. Analysts worried that sports bras and bralettes may be alienating its core customers. \u201cBrand imagery is now leaning toward more natural looks and relatable beauty,\u201d analysts wrote. \u201cHowever, given how fundamental the \u2018sexy\u2019 image is to the Victoria\u2019s Secret brand, we believe a full-brand pivot to catch up with current trends may be challenging to execute.\u201d So does that mean the end of the Victoria\u2019s Secret angel and the yearly TV broadcast show? The company hasn\u2019t said, but, as one New York stylist pointed out (though under the cover of anonymity in the face of a still powerful brand): \u201cHow many times can you send a model down the catwalk in angel wings? It\u2019s tired and has been for 10 years.\u201d Efforts to break into the Chinese lingerie market, already double that of the US and estimated to hit $33bn by 2020, according to Euromonitor, stumbled in November when the company became entangled in Chinese bureaucracy and models including Gigi Hadid and singer Katy Perry were denied visas to attend a major fashion show. But there\u2019s a larger question about whether #MeToo has accelerated a more generalized reaction to a perspective described as \u201cthe male gaze\u201d. \u201cPolitics and style might seem like distant cousins, but they\u2019re increasingly intertwined in a highly politicized world,\u201d Ted Marzilli, CEO of data products for YouGov, told Forbes in April. Elissa Sangster, the director of the Fort\u00e9 Foundation, a group looking to improve the number of women in leadership and executive positions, told the Guardian: \u201cIf you\u2019re looking to get more women into leadership and to feel respected in the workplace, to then turn on your television and it\u2019s the Victoria\u2019s Secret show, one wonders: \u2018Is that really how we want to present ourselves?\u2019\u201d In an interview with the Financial Times earlier this year, Les Wexner, 80, who purchased L brands for $1m in 1982 when it was on the verge of bankruptcy, rejected the reading that male objectification of women contributed to Victoria\u2019s Secret\u2019s woes. \u201cI think that\u2019s just complete nonsense,\u201d he says. If Lululemon is selling skintight yoga pants, \u201cit\u2019s because that\u2019s what women want to buy\u201d. But is it too soon to count Victoria\u2019s Secret out? The company was the biggest retailer of lingerie in the world from 2006 to 2016. Sales surged from $4.5bn to $7bn. But now, with 200 million young Chinese women to sell to, China is the only game in town. Last week, shares in the Chinese language lingerie giant Cosmo Girl surged on news that it had a new chief strategic officer \u2013 none other than Sharen Jester Turney, the former Victoria\u2019s Secret CEO who led the US brand through its years of growth and glory.",

      "bodyText": "Members of a team of 27 lecturers and art workshop leaders who say that they were sacked by the National Gallery in London have spoken this weekend of the heartache behind their collective legal action against an institution they still love and thought of as \u201ca second home\u201d. \u201cIt has been a difficult atmosphere at work for a while now,\u201d said Karly Allen, 43, who has led many visitor sessions at the gallery, including a long and successful series of life-drawing classes. \u201cLeaving has broken peoples\u2019 hearts, really.\u201d The highly qualified group, most of whom have worked with visitors to the Trafalgar Square gallery for at least a decade, say they were told they were no longer needed in October last year, but were given no compensation or recognition of their long service. A small number of them were offered new work, for less money and on reduced terms. Last week the 27 learned their claim to have their employee status and rights recognised will be heard in full at a tribunal later this year. \u201cIt is encouraging that the tribunal has allowed eight days to hear our case, which was unexpected. Now we have to fund the legal costs,\u201d said Allen. \u201cI\u2019ve worked there for 18 years, so am a relative newcomer, as some of us have worked for more than 40 years. It has felt like a second home, so the process \u2026 has been really upsetting.\u201d Her former colleague, art historian and performer Richard Stemp, has worked at the gallery for 24 years and was one of those offered a new contract. Yet, he says, he cannot afford to take on the work. \u201cNo matter how very rewarding it has been as a job, the new terms are not acceptable,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are generally appalled by what has happened.\u201d Stemp, 55, who has a Cambridge doctorate and lives in east London, is typical of a regular workforce who have a combined knowledge of the gallery\u2019s collection that might well be considered a valuable national resource in its own terms. He feels expelled from the beloved landmark building in which he has happily run guided tours and classes for so long. \u201cSadly, I think I worked my last session on Tuesday,\u201d said Stemp, whose book on the Italian renaissance was republished last week. \u201cI will miss talking about the collection and sharing my enthusiasm for the paintings, and learning new things from the public reactions.\u201d Another former educator, Linda Bolton, 64, has led sessions for blind and partially sighted people, and with the elderly, as well as in schools, over 27 years of teaching and operating as the public face of the gallery. Even her basic guided tour, she said, \u201cprovided a way to communicate to the public at its widest, the international visitor paying a one-off visit and the regular attender, happy to engage repeatedly with the nation\u2019s paintings\u201d. She particularly loved giving talks to school groups. \u201cThe community is enriched by its education programmes and we were enriched by their participation,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel privileged to have made a bit of a difference; to have made the National Gallery a place where people could find a voice. So many times a teacher would tell us, of the prime contributor in a session, that they usually didn\u2019t say anything in class.\u201d Allen studied at Camberwell College of Arts, at the Ruskin School of Art, Oxford, and then for an art history MA at Soas in London. \u201cWe are all graduates or postgrads, and we each have areas we are particularly passionate about. For me, it is the drawing and the work of Piero della Francesca, Raphael, Vel\u00e1zquez and Caravaggio. I\u2019ll miss the conversations with visitors, getting across the way that painting is really about what it is to be human.\u201d The 27 worked regularly, were issued security passes and ate in the staff canteen. \u201cI have never had a period when I haven\u2019t heard from the gallery. I took maternity leave, but could not call it that. The gallery refused to pay me statutory maternity pay, as well as denying us our other rights as employees. It is these sort of issues that need to be sorted out.\u201d The dismissed educators, Allen pointed out, only existed as a team because the gallery put them together, taxing them at source on the payroll, calling them in for training, annual reviews and strategy meetings. This weekend the gallery emphasised that all the \u201cfreelance workers\u201d had been consulted and that their individual claims \u201chave arisen out of the gallery\u2019s wish to change from offering ad hoc work to offering more secure employment, with additional pension and worker benefits\u201d as part of wider plan to use digital technology to \u201cwiden our engagement\u201d. \u201cThe gallery is not yet in receipt of the details of each complaint, but believes that we have acted both lawfully and fairly,\u201d it said. The dispute follows recent high-profile claims made by \u201cgig economy\u201d workers in the private sector, including those against Uber and Pimlico Plumbers. Allen suspects their own case is just the tip of an arts-sector iceberg. \u201cThis is bigger than just us, which is one of the reasons we want to proceed and have started a crowdfunding campaign for our legal costs,\u201d she said. \u201cThe gallery has cast aside more than 500 years of collective experience, experience they have relied upon for the past 45 years.\u201d Karly Allen, 43, worked at the gallery for 18 years \u201cWhen we look at a painting we see ourselves reflected back, which is why it\u2019s so rewarding to share the experience with groups of visitors. It offers us a sense of connection with other humans across time and space. It feels as if the paintings absorb all the conversations that happen in front of them, and our job is to fuel this communication between pictures and people. \u201cI\u2019ll always remember the woman who approached me after a lecture where I had talked about Duccio\u2019s The Virgin and Child with saints Dominic and Aurea to say, \u2018I\u2019ve been looking at this picture for over 50 years and I\u2019ve never seen it quite like that before.\u2019 I was only in my mid-twenties and felt so humbled; what a testament to the power of paintings to keep unfolding the more you look.\u201d Richard Stemp, 55, worked at the gallery for 24 years \u201cI can\u2019t tell you how many times I\u2019ve had a really mouthy kid in a group who just won\u2019t stop talking \u2013 it\u2019s not ideal because you want everyone to contribute. But then afterwards an astonished teacher asks, \u201cHow did you get that child to talk? They never say anything in class!\u201d \u201cJust recently I had a group of big and sulky teenagers who looked like an art gallery was the last place they wanted to be. But one of them was being remarkably observant and very perceptive \u2013 way ahead of me \u2013 and made connections that no other student has made in the 24 years I\u2019ve been there. After the talk the teacher come up to me, thanking me profusely, and told me that he was one of the most disruptive students in her class. That\u2019s the power of art.\u201d Linda Bolton, 64, taught at the gallery for 27 years \u201cI clearly remember turning from my shopping trolley in Woolwich Tesco to look at a small child one day. \u201cHello, do you remember me?\u201d I had a stab. \u201cFrom the National Gallery? What did we look at?\u201d \u201cThe Judgment of Paris and one about Bacchus and Ariadne on the island\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ve got a good memory.\u201d \u201cWe did it later in school assembly. I was Bacchus.\u201d \u201cGreat! Have you been back there?\u201d \u201cYes. I took my uncle when he was looking after my sister and me. I told him all about all the paintings we looked at. The Greek and Roman myth ones specially.\u201d \u201cI bet he was impressed, at your memory\u201d \u201cI think he was. He\u2019s taking me and my cousins there in half term.\u201d I said I hoped I\u2019d see him there. I knew I probably wouldn\u2019t. And in a sense it didn\u2019t matter. Job done. And I was glad to have been part of the very big something. The something that brought art and stories to life, and gave ownership to being alive and engaged in public spaces.",

      "bodyText": "There is always a sense of \u201cthey would say that, wouldn\u2019t they?\u201d when a state-funded global agency that promotes free trade says that a hard Brexit would be bad for everyone. That was the International Monetary Fund\u2019s stance before Britain\u2019s referendum on European Union membership, and in the wake of the vote the Washington-based lender of last resort to near-bankrupt countries (most recently Argentina) has, unsurprisingly, stuck to its line. Last week, IMF analysts said that the EU could lose as much as 1.5% of gross domestic product from a \u201cno-deal\u201d Brexit while the UK would suffer an even bigger hit \u2013 a 4% loss of national income. Such are the longstanding and complex trading links between EU countries that a loss of trade is inevitable should the UK crash out of the single market and the customs union to occupy the same trading position as any other non-EU country. It\u2019s for this reason that only a hard core of Brexit campaigners promotes a no-deal Brexit as the best way forward for the UK. These are the economists who favour tearing down trade barriers whether the move is reciprocated or not. They welcome Britain throwing open its borders to the best goods and brightest minds the world has to offer on the basis that you get the same or better than can be produced at home for a relatively cheaper cost. As a direct result, uncompetitive industries go to the wall while firms with a competitive edge find they can blossom. As long as the latter compensate for the losses from the former, the gamble pays off. The trade minister, Liam Fox, the former foreign secretary Boris Johnson and the chief troublemaker, Jacob Rees-Mogg, are among the gamblers who reckon the calamity facing Britain\u2019s car industry, aircraft industry, pharmaceuticals sector and agriculture businesses will be overcome by the enormous benefits to service companies of a new free-for-all. The extent of this gamble is laid bare by the IMF. But the effect is not just on the UK. How the EU27, and especially those countries neighbouring Britain, would also be victims is set out in stark terms. Ireland, the Netherlands and Belgium \u201care among the most exposed economies to Brexit-related adverse shocks\u201d, the IMF said, with Ireland told to expect \u201coutput losses of similar magnitude to those estimated for the UK\u201d. EU officials appear to recognise that a deal is becoming more unlikely with every week that goes by \u2013 and, as resignations from Theresa May\u2019s cabinet continue, that it is only going to get harder to find a compromise which a majority of MPs can support. However, they don\u2019t appear ready to do what it takes to resolve the situation, and that would be to reinterpret workers\u2019 rights for all EU nations and not just the UK. Maybe it\u2019s pride that intrudes on Brussels\u2019 negotiating position. Maybe it is a form of defeatism that denies them the energy to revisit the EU rulebook. But whatever prevents them acting, they know they should have offered David Cameron a compromise before the referendum vote \u2013 one that would have allowed him to deny EU workers access to the UK\u2019s state services and benefits if they did not have a job on arrival. It\u2019s possible such a compromise will be offered as a last-gasp measure, to win over all but the hardline Brexiters to May\u2019s compromise plan. There are many insiders who believe it would also be enough to turn the Labour MPs who voted against their own party and the Brexit bill amendment to keep Britain inside the customs union. Without such an offer, the odds on the UK crashing out of Europe are rising. The IMF is right to highlight how harmful the impact of that would be for everyone involved. Google fine is too little, too late If anyone can challenge the might of Silicon Valley it is the EU\u2019s competition commissioner, Margrethe Vestager, who has a strong track record of tackling the powerful. After more than three years of investigations, Vestager announced last week that Google\u2019s control over the Android mobile phone platform, which is used on 80% of all phones across the world, is too great and constitutes abuse of a dominant position. The case against Google is compelling. Europe has a problem with the way Google controls access by phone makers to its Play store, where users can buy a vast array of apps. Play is considered essential to luring any would-be phone buyer. It\u2019s free for mobile-phone makers to license it but only if they jump through certain hoops, one of which is the pre-installation of 11 Google apps, including Chrome and search. Google has also blocked licensees from using other versions of Android and separately entered into search revenue-sharing agreements with some manufacturers. Vestager has been decisive. She fined Google \u20ac4.3bn (\u00a33.8bn) for \u201cvery serious illegal behaviour\u201d and ordered it to decouple Chrome and search from licensing of the Play store and end its revenue-share deals. The fine is certainly big, but the remedy may be too little, too late to change much for the better. Google has already succeeded in cementing its services as \u201cmust-haves\u201d that consumers seek out. The EU\u2019s hope that competition might grow in the form of another version of Android appears fanciful. While it may foster competition in mobile search and browsers in the long term, it could hurt consumers by increasing the costs of handsets and therefore reducing competition among smartphone manufacturers. The intentions may be sound, but it feels as if Vestager is trying to close the door after the horse has bolted. Online gaming is odds-on for greater regulation The saga of fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs), the bookmakers\u2019 favourite cash cow, was always something of a sideshow for the gambling industry. With the exception of the bookies themselves, there was widespread support for curbing machines allowing punters to stake \u00a3300 a minute. But the debate dragged on too long and drowned out more pressing matters. Online gambling, which accounts for more than 40% of the betting industry, has escaped regulatory stricture so far. But for how long? Research by the Guardian has revealed that nearly 90 minutes of gambling adverts \u2013 dominated by online outfits \u2013 were shown on ITV during the World Cup, when peak audiences hit nearly 30 million. It comes as no surprise to hear parents complain that their children are parroting online gambling companies\u2019 slogans, even reciting odds. The government has said it is not minded to address gambling ads because there is no evidence they are causing any harm to kids or other vulnerable groups, such as addicts. That\u2019s true, but only because Labour\u2019s liberalisation of gambling in 2005 was, incredibly, not accompanied by the commissioning of in-depth research to measure the policy\u2019s impact. Advertising isn\u2019t the only area that deserves greater attention. You cannot place a bet on the high street using a credit card. Not so online, where addicts freely use debt to rack up yet more debt. The online industry\u2019s defence is that it has the technological tools to track player behaviour and block problem gamblers. Yet a lengthening string of regulatory settlements suggests they are failing in this regard. Furthermore, GamStop, the industry scheme allowing addicts to exclude themselves from gambling sites, is in complete disarray. Traditional bookmakers failed to get their house in order on FOBTs and paid the price. It remains to be seen whether the online industry has learned any lessons from that.",

It\u2019s for this reason that only a hard core of Brexit campaigners promotes a no-deal Brexit as the best way forward for the UK.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.economistsforfreetrade.com/who-we-are/\" title=\"\">These are the economists</a> who favour tearing down trade barriers whether the move is reciprocated or not. They welcome Britain throwing open its borders to the best goods and brightest minds the world has to offer on the basis that you get the same or better than can be produced at home for a relatively cheaper cost.</p> <p>As a direct result, uncompetitive industries go to the wall while firms with a competitive edge find they can blossom. As long as the latter compensate for the losses from the former, the gamble pays off.</p> <p>The trade minister, Liam Fox, the former foreign secretary Boris Johnson and the chief troublemaker, Jacob Rees-Mogg, are among the gamblers who reckon the calamity facing Britain\u2019s car industry, aircraft industry, pharmaceuticals sector and agriculture businesses will be overcome by the enormous benefits to service companies of a new free-for-all.</p> <p>The extent of this gamble is laid bare by the IMF. But the effect is not just on the UK. How the EU27, and especially those countries neighbouring Britain, would also be victims is set out in stark terms.</p> <p>Ireland, the Netherlands and Belgium \u201care among the most exposed economies to Brexit-related adverse shocks\u201d, the IMF said, with Ireland told to expect \u201coutput losses of similar magnitude to those estimated for the UK\u201d.</p> <p>EU officials appear to recognise that a deal is becoming more unlikely with every week that goes by \u2013 and, as resignations from Theresa May\u2019s cabinet continue, that it is only going to get harder to find a compromise which a majority of MPs can support.</p> <p>However, they don\u2019t appear ready to do what it takes to resolve the situation, and that would be to reinterpret workers\u2019 rights for all EU nations and not just the UK.</p> <p>Maybe it\u2019s pride that intrudes on Brussels\u2019 negotiating position. Maybe it is a form of defeatism that denies them the energy to revisit the EU rulebook. But whatever prevents them acting, they know they should have offered David Cameron a compromise before the referendum vote \u2013 one that would have allowed him to deny EU workers access to the UK\u2019s state services and benefits if they did not have a job on arrival.</p> <p>It\u2019s possible such a compromise will be offered as a last-gasp measure, to win over all but the hardline Brexiters to May\u2019s compromise plan. There are many insiders who believe it would also be enough to turn the Labour MPs who voted against their own party and the Brexit bill amendment to keep Britain inside the customs union.</p> <p>Without such an offer, the odds on the UK crashing out of Europe are rising. The IMF is right to highlight how harmful the impact of that would be for everyone involved.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"76c20f5223322c81f520c0639398dcceb9c815f5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/76c20f5223322c81f520c0639398dcceb9c815f5/0_133_3652_2192/1000.jpg\" alt=\"EU competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager announcing a record fine on Google last week.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">EU competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager announcing a record fine on Google last week.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Thys/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Google fine is too little, too late <br></h2> <p>If anyone can challenge the might of Silicon Valley it is the EU\u2019s competition commissioner, Margrethe Vestager, who has a strong track record of tackling the powerful. After more than three years of investigations, Vestager announced last week that Google\u2019s control over the Android mobile phone platform, which is used on 80% of all phones across the world, is too great and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jul/18/google-faces-record-multibillion-fine-from-eu-over-android\" title=\"\">constitutes abuse of a dominant position</a>.</p> <p>The case against Google is compelling. Europe has a problem with the way Google controls access by phone makers to its Play store, where users can buy a vast array of apps. Play is considered essential to luring any would-be phone buyer. It\u2019s free for mobile-phone makers to license it but only if they jump through certain hoops, one of which is the pre-installation of 11 Google apps, including Chrome and search. Google has also blocked licensees from using other versions of Android and separately entered into search revenue-sharing agreements with some manufacturers.</p> <p>Vestager has been decisive. She fined Google \u20ac4.3bn (\u00a33.8bn) for \u201cvery serious illegal behaviour\u201d and ordered it to decouple Chrome and search from licensing of the Play store and end its revenue-share deals. The fine is certainly big, but the remedy may be too little, too late to change much for the better. Google has already succeeded in cementing its services as \u201cmust-haves\u201d that consumers seek out.</p> <p>The EU\u2019s hope that competition might grow in the form of another version of Android appears fanciful. While it may foster competition in mobile search and browsers in the long term, it could hurt consumers by increasing the costs of handsets and therefore reducing competition among smartphone manufacturers.</p> <p>The intentions may be sound, but it feels as if Vestager is trying to close the door after the horse has&#xa0;bolted.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"678ea2b78ecacfa5db8d71561fedcfbc98fc1627\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/678ea2b78ecacfa5db8d71561fedcfbc98fc1627/40_0_1200_720/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ray Winstone in an advert for an online gambling site.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ray Winstone in an advert for an online gambling site.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: bet365</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Online gaming is odds-on for greater regulation</h2> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jun/15/labour-blasts-government-for-secret-delays-to-fixed-odds-betting-terminal-curbs\" title=\"\">saga of fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs)</a>, the bookmakers\u2019 favourite cash cow, was always something of a sideshow for the gambling industry.</p> <p>With the exception of the bookies themselves, there was widespread support for curbing machines allowing punters to stake \u00a3300 a minute. But the debate dragged on too long and drowned out more pressing matters.</p> <p>Online gambling, which accounts for more than 40% of the betting industry, has escaped regulatory stricture so far. But for how long?</p> <p>Research by the <em>Guardian</em> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/jul/15/children-bombarded-with-betting-adverts-during-world-cup\" title=\"\">has revealed that nearly 90 minutes of gambling adverts \u2013 dominated by online outfits \u2013 were shown on ITV</a> during the World Cup, when peak audiences hit nearly 30 million. It comes as no surprise to hear parents complain that their children are parroting online gambling companies\u2019 slogans, even reciting odds.</p> <p>The government has said it is not minded to address gambling ads because there is no evidence they are causing any harm to kids or other vulnerable groups, such as addicts. That\u2019s true, but only because Labour\u2019s liberalisation of gambling in 2005 was, incredibly, not accompanied by the commissioning of in-depth research to measure the policy\u2019s impact.</p> <p>Advertising isn\u2019t the only area that deserves greater attention. You cannot place a bet on the high street using a credit card. Not so online, where addicts freely use debt to rack up yet more debt.</p> <p>The online industry\u2019s defence is that it has the technological tools to track player behaviour and block problem gamblers. Yet a lengthening string of regulatory settlements suggests they are failing in this regard. Furthermore, GamStop, the industry scheme allowing addicts to exclude themselves from gambling sites, is in complete disarray. </p> <p>Traditional bookmakers failed to get their house in order on FOBTs and paid the price. It remains to be seen whether the online industry has learned any lessons from that.</p>",

It is increasingly difficult to throw a blanket over a group of companies this diverse. They do share some common ground, though. All of them have grown rapidly to become household names. All have harnessed technology to disrupt traditional industries or create new ones. All would welcome the chance to talk about strong financial results this week, rather than ethical or regulatory matters. Facebook probably has most cause to want to shift the narrative.

Far easier, surely, to be taking plaudits from investors after presenting second-quarter figures on Wednesday. Facebook increasingly dominates the online advertising market, something that analysts at Jefferies have said shows no sign of abating. Its shares have already recovered from the losses caused by concerns about users\u2019 privacy and Jefferies reckons rising sales \u2013 and increased potential for video advertising through Instagram \u2013 will continue to drive it forward. Amazon\u2019s second-quarter figures are out on Thursday, with the cardboard-clad retail juggernaut expected to roll on. JP Morgan makes the retailer one of its top stock picks, predicting revenues higher than expectations at nearly $54bn (\u00a341bn). That\u2019ll be another red letter day for the founder, Jeff Bezos, named the richest man in modern history last week with a net worth of $150bn. Amazon\u2019s workers, some of whom have reported sleeping in tents to save money or skipping toilet breaks to avoid disciplinary action, may be marginally less delighted. Twitter reports on Friday and will be hoping to rack up its third profit in a row. At some point this year, it is likely to report a steep fall in user numbers after a purge of fake accounts, part of an effort to deal with what some trendy kids are calling \u201cfake news\u201d. High user numbers tend to support high advertising revenue, so the prospect of a fall caused some jitters in the shares recently, but the effect of the purge won\u2019t show up until next quarter, Twitter\u2019s chief financial officer said earlier this month. No tech company has taken a bigger knock recently than Google, slapped with a record \u20ac4.3bn fine by the EU last week for using its Android phone operating system to cement its dominance of internet searches. Hefty as the fine was, it\u2019s fairly small beer for Google\u2019s parent, Alphabet, which has more than $100bn in cash reserves. While litigation remains a concern, Alphabet has shown that its horizons extend beyond Google by spreading into lucrative areas such as healthcare. Investors will be watching its eye-watering investment figures closely, but it has been a consistent financial performer and no big surprises are expected come half-year figures on Monday. If Google is the sturdy old oak of tech stocks, Spotify is a mere sapling after its unconventional but successful float earlier this year. Despite never having made a profit, its shares have risen ever since, with investors keen on the huge growth potential of music streaming, where Spotify is dominant.
