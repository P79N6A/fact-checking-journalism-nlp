      "bodyText": "Britain's smaller manufacturers have suffered a drop in orders and output over the last three months and complained that lack of access to bank loans continued to curb their spending plans, according to a survey by the CBI business lobby group. Companies are cautiously optimistic, however, that demand will pick up in coming months, the CBI said, in the latest sign that the Bank of England may hold off from moves to stimulate the economy at its policy-setting meeting this week. The CBI's survey of small and medium-sized manufacturers suggested a bigger than anticipated fall in new orders in the three months to April was driven by a drop in both domestic and export demand. Output also fell for the fourth consecutive quarter and companies said getting loans remained a challenge, with the proportion citing external finance as a likely constraint on capital spending at its highest level since October 2010. \"It's been another disappointing quarter for small and medium-sized manufacturing firms, who have seen new orders and output continue to fall,\" said Stephen Gifford, CBI director of economics. \"Conditions will remain challenging for the sector. Fears about the impact of political and economic conditions abroad on export demand have risen and there is little sign in this survey that credit conditions are improving.\" Manufacturers have faced high energy and materials costs while struggling to raise the prices they charge to customers. Profit margins were squeezed in the last three months as growth in average unit costs was the fastest since October 2011, the CBI said. Manufacturers do not expect that to let up in the coming quarter, with domestic prices rising only slightly while cost inflation remains high. There were some bright spots in the survey of 348 companies, with optimism about export prospects up for the first time in a year. Manufacturers also expect output to grow slightly in the next three months and for there to be a \"modest\" increase in headcount. Other business surveys have had a slightly more positive tone, in particular last week's closely watched Purchasing Managers' Index surveys, which showed stronger than expected growth in the dominant services sector. Those readings have reinforced expectations that the Bank's monetary policy committee (MPC) will not make any policy changes this week. Only three out of 63 economists polled by Reuters expect the BoE to announce on Thursday that it is extending its quantitative easing (QE) programme. Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at IHS Global Insight, said: \"The odds favour the Bank of England continuing to hold off from more stimulus on Thursday at the end of the May MPC meeting.

      "bodyText": "A combination of poor weather, supermarket price wars and the continuing economic gloom has led to price tags in high street stores rising at their slowest rate in three and a half years, according to the British Retail Consortium and research group Nielsen. Last month food prices fell 0.4% while non-food prices dropped 1.1% compared with March to levels last seen in November 2009. \"Household finances are still under pressure, but it's clear that isn't coming from the shops,\" said Helen Dickinson, BRC director-general. Fashion retailers and suppliers suffered in April due to a late flurry of snow and cold weather, which left clothes rails lined with summer dresses and T-shirts that remained unsold. Marks &amp; Spencer suffered a quarterly fall of 3.8% in non-food sales and resorted to a series of one-day sales and online promotions in an attempt to shift extra stock, with other retailers following suit. As a result prices on all clothing and footwear were down 2.5% compared with March, and down 4.7% on the same month last year. DIY and gardening centres also suffered from the cold weather, with many gardeners delaying their purchases during the Easter weekend, which is seen as the busiest time of year for retailers such as B&amp;Q and Homebase. Hardware, gardening and DIY prices fell 0.7% on March, but were up by 0.2% on last year, following an Easter of heavy promotions. Food prices did fall slightly on last month. However, they were up 2.9% on last year. The recent falls are believed to be due to supermarket promotions and recent price wars. It follows the launch of Tesco's price promise, which matches both branded and non-branded food against its rivals, although Sainsbury's has complained to the Advertising Standards Authority, claiming it is unfair. Mike Watkins, head of retailer and business insight at Nielsen, said: \"This time last year food prices were on the increase during the washout of early summer 2012. \"Retailers will now be looking to keep prices competitive over the next few weeks to keep whatever momentum there is in sales growth going, and for high street retailers this could require summer discounts to start sooner rather than later.\" Another survey by Visa Europe found month-on-month consumer spending fell in April by 2.5%, following three successive months of growth, suggesting shoppers are spending more carefully and forcing retailers to offer more discounts.

Some counterfeit versions had been found to contain printer ink and pesticides, the company said. Pfizer will offer three free tablets with a first order and 30% off the price of a second. Other drugs companies will watch the development with interest. Traditionally, drugs makers have not sold directly to patients, selling instead to wholesalers which distribute the drugs to doctors, hospitals and pharmacies. If Pfizer's idea takes off, other companies could follow suit with everything from popular diet pills to sleeping aids. Viagra, which was launched in 1998, became a global sensation, backed in the US by a wave of advertising featuring middle-aged men, including the soccer star Pele and senator Bob Dole, talking about \"ED\", or erectile dysfunction. In 2000, Viagra accounted for 90% of all ED pill sales but it has been hurt by the arrival of rivals including Cialis and Levitra and an explosion in counterfeit sales worldwide. Last month, Pfizer said Viagra sales had fallen 7% in the first three months of the year, to $461m. \"There are almost 24 million searches a year for Viagra online,\" said Victor Clavelli, senior director of Pfizer's primary care business unit. \"By offering men with ED convenient access and a legitimate alternative to purchase Viagra online, our hope is that Pfizer will help rein in the distribution of fake ED products.\" Matthew Bassiur, Pfizer's vice-president for global security, said: \"We have seen counterfeit medicines manufactured in filthy and deplorable conditions, yet some people do not realize the risks that this poses to their health and safety, our top priority. Counterfeit medicines often contain the wrong or incorrect levels of active ingredient, as well as potentially dangerous contaminants. Samples of counterfeit Viagra tested by our labs have contained pesticides, wallboard, commercial paint and printer ink. These findings motivate us to continue our aggressive global efforts to stop those who prey on unsuspecting patients.\" In 2011, Pfizer conducted chemical analysis of pills advertised as \"Pfizer's Viagra\" and bought from 22 websites that appeared in the top search results for the phrase \"buy Viagra\". The study found that about 80% of these pills were counterfeit; although such pills contained Viagra's active ingredient, sildenafil citrate, the amount was only 30% to 50% of what was advertised. Unscrupulous online pharmacies claim to sell generic versions of Viagra. But generic Viagra does not exist: Pfizer's patents give it the exclusivity on Viagra until 2020 in the US and for many years after that in other countries.",

    "webTitle": "Paul Krugman's call to arms against austerity", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Paul Krugman has just passed the landmark 1 million followers on Twitter. Not bad for an academic economist, albeit one with a Nobel prize under his arm, a prominent position at Princeton University, and a New York Times blog. His following is a reward for battling the conventional wisdom that austerity can foster a recovery. From the moment Lehman Brothers was allowed to crash, it seemed that only Krugman, his compatriot Joseph Stiglitz, another Nobel prizewinner for the liberal cause, and New York professor Nouriel Roubini, who had loudly predicted the crash, consistently confronted the \"austerians\" in Washington, Brussels and the UK Treasury. More than four years on, austerity is being questioned as never before, not least because most countries implementing a deficit-reduction policy have failed to grow. Krugman, his blog and comments on Twitter, have become the focal point for objectors worldwide. Speaking to the Guardian to publicise the second edition of his book End This Depression Now, he argues that his battle will go on until policymakers realise that their reliance on deficit reduction is a \"delusional\" misreading of basic economics. But despite his persistent criticism, austerity remains the default position for most western governments. For such a sophisticated thinker, Krugman's solution \u2013 which upsets some liberal supporters \u2013 is straightforward. Asked if he is concerned a splurge of borrowing will trigger a repeat of the financial bubbles that caused the crash and spur inflation as too much money chases too few goods, he is dismissive. \"As far as planting the seeds of the next crisis, bear in mind that leverage is still falling, so I don't see the problem at this point,\" he says. In Krugman's view, concerns about ageing populations, looming health costs, the changing nature of the workforce in a digital age and competition from Asian economies for jobs, are for another time. \"Should we be having more spending? The answer must be yes. Why? Because there is plenty of slack in the labour market and investment needs to increase. To me it is clear that there is plenty of room to increase spending without increasing inflation. \"What many people fail to see is that macro economics moves much more slowly than they think. You can read academic papers from the 1930s and after you strip out the arcane academic language, they could be written today.\" Speaking from his office in Princeton, Krugman says texts by economists Hyman Minsky, Michal Kalecki and most of all John Maynard Keynes show Olli Rehn, the EU's finance commissioner and other top Brussels officials are misguided in promoting austerity. Why reinvent the wheel, he asks, when all today's economic problems were solved by theories developed in the 1930s. Minsky, for instance, argued that bankers and others simply forgot about the risks that come with higher debt levels. Forgetfulness is a cornerstone of Krugman's analysis of the crisis. \"I'd go with Minsky: that the best explanation of the crisis is simply that with the passage of time, everybody, including policymakers, forgot about the risks. The economics profession in a way was part of the same phenomenon. \"Things like real business cycle theory, which considers recessions to represent voluntary withdrawal of labour in favour of leisure, would have been rejected as obviously ludicrous when the memory of the Great Depression was still fresh, but could flourish once that memory had faded.\" Five years after the crash, with memories still fresh, Rehn's failure is one of misunderstanding, a failure of intellect, he argues. Krugman dismisses concerns that Germany and the UK are run by politicians of a prime minister Angela Merkel, George Osborne and the eurocracy may represent of a class or generation who want to protect their assets at the expense of people who depend on public services. Robert Shapiro, under secretary of commerce for economic affairs in Bill Clinton's second government and later an economic adviser to Tony Blair, says Krugman has failed to win over many policymakers because he ignores concerns about the re-emergence of a housing bubble and the failure to tackle Wall Street's power. Voters are reluctant to hand power back to governments that blindly led them into the financial crisis, even when it is not solely the politicians' fault. \"It is not irrational that support for government and government solutions has been badly damaged. Governments failed to see the crash coming along with everyone else. So small government is seductive to people who are still sensitive to government failures in the stewardship of the economy,\" says Shapiro. Like Krugman, Shapiro backs the central Keynesian argument for a government spending boost, but urges him to engage with concerns from left and right about what happens to that money. Will the money be spent wisely? \"Some people say a fiscal stimulus will create a new housing bubble, but there haven't been many houses built in the last five years. They say workers have out-of-date skills. But history tells us that if you create jobs people will fill them,\" says Krugman. Are central banks helping? \"I wouldn't say that quantitative easing [QE] has been decisive. It is a fragile and fairly weak tool, so to ask it to override fiscal austerity is asking too much.\" But he wants more QE and is relaxed about inflation at 4% or 5%. Maybe the simplicity of his message is driven by a daily bout with Tea Party representatives and assorted Republicans on his blog and straight jabs from a wide range of austerians on TV talkshows and radio phone-ins. Recently he went head to head with David Stockman, Ronald Reagan's budget director. Stockman said much of the $1.6tn spent by the Federal Reserve as part of its QE policy was swallowed by Wall Street and simply made bankers richer. To back up his argument he pointed to JP Morgan, which made record profits last year. Reluctant to defend profits made by banks using cheap QE funds, Krugman accused his rival of being a \"cranky old man\" and using \"context and model-free numbers embedded in a rant\". Those who argue that extra government spending today could prove as beneficial as in the 1930s still want safeguards and a little circumspection. Krugman refuses to play ball.",

Stockman said much of the $1.6tn spent by the Federal Reserve as part of its QE policy was swallowed by Wall Street and simply made bankers richer. To back up his argument he pointed to JP Morgan, which made record profits last year.</p> <p>Reluctant to defend profits made by banks using cheap QE funds, Krugman accused his rival of being a \"cranky old man\" and using \"context and model-free numbers embedded in a rant\".</p> <p>Those who argue that extra government spending today could prove as beneficial as in the 1930s still want safeguards and a little circumspection. Krugman refuses to play ball.</p>",
