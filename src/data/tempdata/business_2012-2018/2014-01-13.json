      "bodyText": "Lidl has banned sweets and chocolate bars from the checkout at all 600 of its UK stores after surveying parents about the \"pester power\" of their children. The discount supermarket said racks of sweets had been replaced with dried and fresh fruit, oatcakes and juices, following a trial of these healthier options at checkouts last year. Lidl customer research showed that seven out of 10 customers would choose a sweet-free checkout over the traditional one laden with chocolate bars. In a survey for the supermarket, 68% of parents said they were pestered by their children for chocolate at the checkout, and 66% gave in some or all of the time. One in six parents told the supermarket they spend \u00a320-40 a month on supermarket snacks, while a similar number said they had used the offer of a \"treat\" as a reward for good behaviour during the shopping trip. The supermarket claims it is the first UK supermarket to have removed sweets from all its checkouts. Although Tesco and Sainsbury's have removed sweets from counters at their larger outlets, they continue to be sold at the checkouts in convenience stores. Ronny Gottschlich, managing director, Lidl UK, said: \"We know how difficult it can be to say no to pester power, so by removing sweets and chocolates from our tills we can make it easier for parents to reward children in healthier ways.\" The ban comes after a National Obesity Forum report showed that previous estimates that half the UK population will be obese by 2050 had understated the problem. Katharine Jenner at Action on Sugar said campaigners were pleased with Lidl's decision. \"It is an acknowledgement from the retailers that these products are not healthy,\" she said, but added: \"It is one thing to put people off buying, it is another to make products healthier.\"",

In a survey for the supermarket, 68% of parents said they were pestered by their children for chocolate at the checkout, and 66% gave in some or all of the time.</p> <p>One in six parents told the supermarket they spend \u00a320-40 a month on supermarket snacks, while a similar number said they had used the offer of a \"treat\" as a reward for good behaviour during the shopping trip.</p> <p>The supermarket claims it is the first UK supermarket to have removed sweets from all its checkouts. Although Tesco and Sainsbury's have removed sweets from counters at their larger outlets, they continue to be sold at the checkouts in convenience stores.</p> <p>Ronny Gottschlich, managing director, Lidl UK, said: \"We know how difficult it can be to say no to pester power, so by removing sweets and chocolates from our tills we can make it easier for parents to reward children in healthier ways.\"</p> <p>The ban comes after a National Obesity Forum report showed that previous estimates that half the UK population will be obese by 2050 had understated the problem.</p> <p>Katharine Jenner at Action on Sugar said campaigners were pleased with Lidl's decision. \"It is an acknowledgement from the retailers that these products are not healthy,\" she said, but added: \"It is one thing to put people off buying, it is another to make products healthier.\"</p>",

An independent Scottish state would become responsible for a fair and proportionate share of the UK\u2019s current liabilities, but a share of the outstanding stock of debt instruments that have been issued by the UK would not be transferred to Scotland. For example, there would be no change in counterparty for holders of UK gilts. Instead, an independent Scotland would need to raise funds in order to reimburse the continuing UK for this share.</p> <p>1.2:&#xa0;An entirely separate contract between the continuing UK Government and an independent Scottish state\u2019s Government would need to be established. The respective shares of debt and the terms of repayment would be subject to negotiation.</p> <p>1.3: In the event of independence, the full spectrum of assets and liabilities \u2013 past, future and contingent \u2013 would need to be considered in negotiations between the continuing UK and Scottish Governments, on a case-by-case basis. This means that the negotiations would need to cover the arrangements for all forms of debt covered in this note, not just gilts and Treasury bills.&#xa0;</p> <p>Financial hacks are crunching through the details now:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/faisalislam/statuses/422672154677616640\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>&quot;in event of independence, full spectrum of assets and liabilities \u2013 past, future, contingent \u2013 wd need to be considered in negotiations&quot;</p>&mdash; Faisal Islam (@faisalislam) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/faisalislam/statuses/422672154677616640\">January 13, 2014</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/jsphctrl/statuses/422666203811704832\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>&quot;An entirely separate contract&quot; between the UK and Scotland would be negotiated over Scotland paying the UK a share of the debt (says HMT).</p>&mdash; Joseph Cotterill (@jsphctrl) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jsphctrl/statuses/422666203811704832\">January 13, 2014</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-52d3b5c9e4b0c335f017e2b6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-01-13T10:04:14.274Z\">10.04am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Elsewhere in the eurozone, Portugal's hopes of a credit rating upgrade from Moody's have been dashed, for the moment.</p> <p>Moody's had been expected to update its view on Portugal on January 10, and perhaps raise its outlook to positive from stable.

Here's the key points from today. \u2022 Japan's Suntory is taking control of US drinks firm Beam in a $16bn deal. Activist shareholder Pershing Square will make a hefty profit, as Suntory snaps up brands including Maker's Mark bourbon and Courvoisier cognac. The news broke around lunchtime UK time. \u2022 But SodaStream investors are feeling flat -- its shares have tumbled by 20% after a profit warning. \u2022 World stock markets rose today, partly helped by predictions that Friday's weak jobs report will force the US Fed to keep policy loose for some time. Here's the closing prices. \u2022 The dollar weakened, though, dropping 1% against the yen. \u2022 The UK Treasury has pledged to talk on all of Britain's national debt, up to the point of independence, if Scotland votes to break away from the rest of the Union. First minister Alex Salmond says it's a breakthrough for Scotland, while one analyst argues it's a sensible move by London. \u2022 There's tension in Greece after more Golden Dawn MPs were jailed over the weekend \u2022 And intrigue in the City after Sports Direct bought a 5% in rival retailer Debenhams. Goodnight, and thanks as ever for the comments. GW Here's our news story on the big deal of the day -- Suntory's takeover of US spirits firm Beam. As my colleague Simon Bowers reports, an activist US hedge fund is cashing in: The American drinks group behind Jim Beam bourbon as well as Scotch whiskies Teacher's and Laphroaig has been sold to Japanese whisky distiller Suntory as part of a $16bn deal. Illinois-based Beam Inc is best known as the maker of Kentucky bourbons such as Knob Creek and Maker's Mark, as well as the eponymous Jim Beam, but the group's drinks cabinet draws together brands from around the world, including Sauza tequila, Courvoisier cognac and Harvey's Bristol Cream to generate annual sales of $2.51bn. The agreed sale of Beam follows shortly after Suntory completed its acquisition of drug group GlaxoSmithKline's legacy soft drinks business, including the Ribena and Lucozade labels, for \u00a31.35bn. The Japanese whisky and beer group is already well-known for acquiring the Orangina brand a little over four year ago. The company also holds the rights to bottle Pepsi and Schweppes in some countries. The sale of Beam, which offers shareholders a 25% premium to the recent share price, will trigger a colossal windfall for activist shareholder Bill Ackman's Pershing Square hedge fund, which is thought to hold 12.8% of the stock. Here's the full story: Japan's Suntory buys maker of Jim Beam bourbon As Sandclaygravel kindly points out in the comments below, Spain's economy minister Luis de Guindos has predicted that its economy expanded by 0.3% in the last three months. De Guindos also predicted that the Spanish jobless rate has now dropped to 25%, from 25.9% in September. Speaking at the Madrid parliament, he said: In the third quarter of 2013, the Spanish economy left behind the recession. Today, the recovery is there, still fragile, but at last there is a recovery. Most of the advanced macroeconomic indicators that we are receiving signal that the recovery is getting firmer. That's it, European stock markets have shut for the day. The main indices all closed higher, with the FTSE 100 climbing to a two-month peak. FTSE 100: up 17 points at 6757, + 0.26% German DAX: up 36 points at 9510, + 0.4% French CAC: up 12 points at 4236, +0.4% Bank shares rose across Europe, after regulators decided to relax new rules forcing them to hold higher capital reserves. And money also moved into shares on anticipation that the state of the US employment market will force the Fed to hold rates low even after it has stopped its bond-buying programme. But generally, it was a calm day for shares, as CMC's Michael Hewson explains: In the absence of any significant economic data today equity investors appear content to sit on their hands and await the outcome of some important earnings announcements from the US banking sector throughout the rest of this week. While a broadly positive session today, trading can best be described as a little lacklustre with not much in the way of a strong directional bias one way or the other, with the FTSE100 flirting with one month highs near 6,775. Banking stocks have enjoyed a fairly positive session after the weekend news that global regulators would be softening new Basel 3 rules on capital and leverage ratios. Leading the gainers we\u2019ve seen RBS, Barclays and Lloyds all enjoy positive sessions. Underperforming supermarket Morrisons is also higher (+6.5%) on speculation that some activist shareholders could force a disposal of some of the company\u2019s property assets in an attempt to raise some extra cash. Also trading higher Associated British Foods is hitting new all-time highs (+2.6%) ahead of an eagerly awaited trading update later this week with Primark expected to announce some positive Christmas trading numbers. Basic resource stocks are higher with gold and silver miner Fresnillo (+3.6%) leading the way after trading at three year lows at the end of last week On the downside Tullow Oil (-3.5%) has slid back after Friday\u2019s strong gains on bid speculation from Statoil. Utility stocks are also on the slide as the more defensive sectors come under pressure on the back of some broker downgrades. Shares in SodaStream have slumped by fifth today after the seller of fizzy drinks kit announced a profit warning. Sodastream, who were all the rage in the early 1980s (I dimly recall) warned shareholders it had not performed well over Christmas. SodaStream dispensers, it seems, struggled to compete with more modern kitchen equipment. Its shares have tumbled by 21% today, after it cut its forecasts for the current financial year. It now anticipates profits of just $41.5m on revenue of $562m, having previously expected to make $54m on revenue of$567m. For those who have never enjoyed the experience of creating your own effervescent drink (pro-tip: Ribena worked well), Associated Press explains: SodaStream makes beverage carbonation systems that allow consumers to turn tap water into sparkling water and carbonated soft drinks. Besides selling the machines, it also makes money by selling gas refills and flavours for it. CEO Daniel Birnbaum said in a statement that the holiday season was \"challenging\" in the U.S. and that its fourth-quarter performance was disappointing. The executive said the company's gross margin was pressured by lower sell-in prices, higher product costs, a product mix shift and unfavourable foreign currency exchange rates. No wonder SodaStream just hired top actress Scarlett Johansson as a 'global brand ambassador'.... Over in Detroit, the annual auto show is kicking off. And, for the first time in a while, there's a sense of optimism on the show floor. From among the 4x4s, the eco-cars and the CEOs, our own Dominic Rushe reports: All three major US car firms are using this year\u2019s show to unveil major new vehicles they hope will power their future success after strong growth in 2012. On Monday Ford unveiled its next generation F-150, the US\u2019s best-selling vehicle, adding new technology and fuel efficiency into the full-size pickup truck. GM\u2019s incoming chief Mary Barra made her first public appearance since her appointment Sunday night, unveiling the GMC Canyon, a midsize pickup. She said she was \u201chonored to stand here tonight and humbly lead this team\u201d. GM\u2019s Chevrolet Stingray was named car of the year at the show Monday morning. More here: Detroit auto show opens with air of optimism as new models unveiled Speaking of the FT....the editor is in jovial mood: Students of the financial crisis, and anyone who enjoyed The Big Short (that's everyone, right?) may be alarmed by Tracy Alloway's latest piece in the Financial Times this afternoon. She reports that US bond investors have been snapping up a new breed of commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS), which consist of various disparate loans bundled together. So far so OK, until you read that it includes loans to a homeless shelter, a chain of African-themed waterparks, and a building converted into a data farm. Not suggesting for a moment that any of them are bad credit risks....but once Wall Street firms get terribly innovative, I get a little nervous. Tracy writes: While originators seek out unorthodox assets to securitise into CMBS deals, concerns about the return of some pre-crisis lending practices have also begun to surface. Pro-forma underwriting, where originators estimate the future cash flows of a property on optimistic projections rather than current rates, has crept back into the market, according to some commercial mortgage brokers who connect property developers with lenders. Over in Greece our correspondent Helena Smith reports that political tensions are high, after three more lawmakers from the far right Golden Dawn party were jailed over the weekend. The move triggered angry scenes outside Athens' main court house, Helena writes: In a political environment that has become ever more explosive,three more Golden Dawn MPs were imprisoned after a leading Athenian magistrate, on the basis of extensive questioning over the weekend, found there was enough evidence to support allegations that the lawmakers had used the extremist group to run a paramilitary criminal organisation. Panaghiotis Iliopoulos, Giorgos Germenis and Efstahtios Boukouras, were taken under police escort to prisons in Athens and Nafplion bringing to six the number of far-right MPS now held in pre-trial detention in the wake of a government crackdown on the party.spurred by the murder of a left-wing musician in September. Germenis, who like all three MPS, vehemently denied the allegations was accused of deliberately recruiting members to conduct attacks against migrants. To the bewilderment of |Greeks, Boukouras denied even being a member of the party saying his views represented those of the centre-left Pasok party currently in government along with prime minister Antonis Samaras' conservative New Democracy party. The decision sparked furious scenes outside Athens courthouse, with Golden Dawn supporters, including the parliamentarian wife of the jailed party leader Nikos Michaloliakos, jostling with journalists and lobbing bottles at camera crews assembled outside the building late Sunday. Ilias Kasidiaris, the party's spokesman who was set free on bail and barred from leaving the country following similar charges.denounced the decision saying: \"not one MP or minister has been brought in for questioning for [economic] scandals and kick-backs. The only ones who are hauled before the courts and illegally imprisoned are Golden Dawn MPs.\" This morning Kasidiaris dismissed suggestions that protestors had been \"at all violent\" echoing earlier comments by Iliopoulos who said \"they were nothing. Nobody was hurt.\" The jailings will almost certainly inflame tensions on a political scene where, fed by popular fury over biting austerity ,measures, the neo fascists have not only retained their support but remain the debt-stricken country's third biggest political force. Golden Dawn has vowed to challenge the Greek government's crackdown in the European Court of Human Rights as being .\"illegal and unconstitutional\".- a move that has mystified many given the party's open contempt for the EU. Attending a press conference to announce the move, late on Friday, the leader of the British National Party, Nick Griffin said the clampdown against the party had been purely motivated by Golden Dawn's soaring popularity. (here's our story from Friday night about Golden Dawn's appeal to the ECHR: Nick Griffin offers strident support to Golden Dawn on visit to Greece) And here's a couple of photos from Saturday night, of Golden Dawn party lawmakers and supporters waving flags and shouting slogans outside a courthouse as the hearings took place. Alan Clarke, economist at Scotiabank, has sent through his thoughts on the UK Treasury's pledge to take on all the UK's national debt if Scotland votes to leave the union. He says: \u2022 It's pre-emptive. It has nipped this in the bud before the market has even thought about making an issue of it. It saves a situation where the market has worked itself into a froth and come out with an announcement at that stage, which may or may not be effective. \u2022 Does it give Alex Salmond an advantage? Possibly, but there will still be negotiations on the contribution that an independent Scotland would have to make to the UK Treasury. But to the uninitiated voting on the issue, this announcement may make them think that voting to leave the UK would be a free option to leave the debt behind too (wrongly). \u2022 Implications for the gilt market \u2013 with the polls still showing a 10-30% lead for the \u2018no\u2019 to independence campaign, the gilt market probably takes this news in its stride. Nonetheless, it is a pre-emptive action that should ensure we avoid too much in the way of volatility nearer to the time of the poll. It could be triples all round for Beam investors. Shares in Beam jumped almost 25% at the start of trading to $83.45, almost exactly the price that Suntory have agreed to pay for the Bourbon-to-tequila firm. That shows investors see little risk of the deal failing -- but also shows Wall Street isn't expecting a bidding war to break out. Suntory's offer looks sweet enough to succeed. Vivien Azer of Citi Research reckons there is little chance of another buyer emerging, partly because Beam must pay a hefty penalty if Suntory is jilted: While some investors may be holding out hope that another buyer emerges, we think the chances of that are low given that: 1) both boards have approved the deal, and 2) there is a $425 million termination fee attached to the deal (though this drops to $275 million if a superior agreement is entered into with a third party by Feb. 26, 2014). Eek. The greenback's decline continues as currency traders continue to sell the US dollar in anticipation that America's central bank will maintain easy monetary policy for some considerable time. The US dollar has now lost over 1% against the yen, to \u00a5102.99 per $1. That's down from \u00a5104.13 on Friday night, shortly after the weak American jobs report was released. That's not great news for the Japanese government, which hoped to drive inflation higher through a weak currency. Tony Fratto, former White House press secretary, suggests Jim Beam bourbon may be worthy of protection -- after learning that it's being acquired by Suntory (see earlier post onwards). (that's the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States). CNBC's David Faber reckons Suntory's bid is large enough to deter a counterbid: And bourbon-sippers also sense the end of an era: Back in London, supermarket chain Morrisons is topping the FTSE 100 leaderboard this morning, with its shares jumping over 5%. It follows reports that the group will placate irate investors (irked by last week's mini profit-warning) by selling some property assets to fund a share buyback scheme But some analysts fear Morrisons faces big problems. Clive Black at Shore Capital said: Whilst there can be short-term gains for shareholders from a comprehensive property sale programme through distributions, we question whether such activity is in the interest of the company in the long-run; will the shareholders that may seek short-term radical action be there for the duration? Morrisons is a low margin business and the desirability of intensifying operational leverage from a major property programme is highly questionable in our view. My colleague Nick Fletcher has the full story here: Amec gains ground on planned \u00a31.9bn deal, while Morrisons climbs on property talk AP sums up the Beam acquisition, which will see Japan's Suntory take control of some classic US spirit brands: Beam, the maker of Jim Beam and Marker's Mark alcohol brands, has agreed to be acquired by Japan's Suntory Holdings Ltd. for approximately $13.62 billion. Shares of the spirits maker rose in Monday premarket trading. Suntory will pay $83.50 per share, a 25% premium to Beam's Friday closing price of $66.97. The companies put the deal's value at about $16 billion, including debt. Suntory has a portfolio of spirits, with whiskies including Yamazaki and Hakushu as well as Midori liqueur and other beverages. Suntory already distributes Beam's products in Japan. Beam distributes Suntory's products in Singapore and other Asian markets. Both companies' boards unanimously approved the transaction, which is targeted to close in the second quarter. It needs approval from Beam Inc. stockholders. A big takeover was just announced in the drinks business, with Japan's Suntory swooping on Beam in a $16bn deal. The acquisition gives Suntory a wide range of major spirits -- Beam's bulging portfolio includes bourbon (Jim Beam, Maker's Mark and Knob Creek), Scotch whiskies (Teacher's and Laphroaig), as well as Canadian Club whisky, Courvoisier cognac, Sauza tequila, and Pinnacle vodka. Quite a lot to knock back in one go. Suntory (which produces several major Japanese whiskies) is paying a 25% premium to Beam's share price. But Rob Cox, global Editor of Reuters Breakingviews, reckons there's still time for a bidding war before last orders: Alex Salmond, Scottish First Minister, has hailed the UK Treasury's promise to take on all Britain's national debt if Scotland votes for independence (see 10.24am). Salmond claimed that the move puts a future independent Scotland in \"an extremely strong negotiating position\" to secure a fair agreement over the dispersal of debt and assets. PA provides the quotes: These documents make clear that we remain prepared to negotiate taking responsibility for financing a fair share of the debts of the UK provided, of course, Scotland secures a fair share of the assets, including the monetary assets. Any market uncertainty in the gilts market has been caused by their own refusal to discuss the terms of independence before the referendum and it is their own insistence that Scotland would be a new state that lands them with the unambiguous legal title to the accumulated debts of the United Kingdom. That position is now beyond argument and today's announcement makes clear that Scotland would be in an extremely strong negotiating position to secure that fair deal. Our Scottish correspondent, Severin Carroll, has the full story here: Treasury promises to honour UK debts up to date of Scottish referendum Statement is intended to calm anxieties about risk that Scotland could refuse to pay share of debt in quarrel over sterling Congratulations to Mario Draghi, who has been named Central Bank Governor of the Year for 2014. Central Banking hailed the European Central Bank president's work in stabilising the eurozone, saying that: Unflappable conviction and outstanding leadership has enabled European Central Bank President Mario Draghi to decisively restore confidence in crisis-hit Europe. The People\u2019s Bank of China was named Central Bank of the year, for having: anchored China\u2019s drive towards a market-based economy by curbing excesses in the financial system while at the same time pushing ahead with interest rate and capital account reform at a time of major political change. (and creating the occasional worrying cash squeeze along the way) Draghi has responded by cautioning that the eurozone crisis is not over: Thanks to both the ECB\u2019s actions and hard work by governments in implementing fiscal consolidation and structural reforms, conditions in financial markets have gradually eased since July 2012. Great leaps have been made in euro area governance and the ECB is playing its part in this. It is still too early to declare victory and the recovery remains fragile, but we can see our very accommodative monetary policy stance finally finding its way through the economy. Here's the full list. World stock markets have nudged close to a six-year high this morning, on speculation that the US Federal Reserve will maintain loose monetary policy for some time after Friday's employment report. The MSCI world equity index gained 0.2 percent, near to December's six-year peak, pushed by a rally in emerging markets where India's Sensex gained 1.8%. The prospect of US monetary policy is arguably good for fast-growing developing nations as it dampens the risk of foreign cash returning to the US if the Federal Reserve reduced money-printing. Although the US unemployment rate fell to 6.7%, nearer the Fed's target, the number of Americans quitting the labour force altogether hit a 36-year high. Banking stocks are leading the rally -- ahead of results from major US financial institutions this week. Banks are also benefitting from the news that global regulators have diluted planned debt limits. Brenda Kelly of IG writes: The US's shocking drop in job-creation for December is still being absorbed by the market, while the uncertainty surrounding the Federal Reserve\u2019s taper timeline for 2014 is returning. Markets have bounced back to a degree and, with corporate earnings kicking off in earnest this week, the focus is very much on the financial sector ahead of full-year reports from the likes of Wells Fargo and Bank of America tomorrow. Investors have put a positive foot forward in this respect, and the FTSE is benefiting from an increased demand for banking stocks this morning. Barclays' shares have added 2.88%, culminating in a four-month high. The bank has been helped in part by an easing of leverage-ratio rules from some of the world\u2019s top central bankers yesterday. But while equities are up, the US dollar is still down against most currencies (including the yen and sterling). Patrick Latchford of Monex Capital Markets warns that the dollar could weaken further: In the wake of that jobs report from the US, there are now big questions hanging over the outlook for the Fed's tapering program and if consensus builds that the world's largest economy has already reached a plateau then further dollar weakness - and falling US imports - may well follow. Correction corner: It was Hong Kong's Hang Seng index which rose 0.2% overnight, not the Nikkei as I wrongly wrote in the opening post. Japan's market is closed today. Apologies. Back to Italy, where the government's borrowing costs have just hit the lowest level since the euro was created, as investors regain confidence in the eurozone's periphery. The Italian treasury sold \u20ac4bn of three-year debt, maturing in 2017, at a yield of just 1.51%, down from 1.79% at a similar sale in November. It also sold 15-year bonds at the lowest interest rate since 2007. It's official: The UK Treasury will take full responsibility for the nation's full national debt if Scotland votes for independence in its upcoming referendum. That doesn't mean, though, that a free Scotland would be devoid of debt. Instead, London would pursue it for a \"fair and proportionate share\" of the current \u00a31.2trillion debt pile. The move is meant to reassure owners of British gilts that they won't suddenly find that their bonds have being repaid by an independent Scotland. It also adds another wrinkle to the independence issue. Scotland wants to use the pound post-independence -- could the Treasury use the possibility of a sterling currency union as leverage? The Treasury confirmed the move in a statement (online here) issued a few minute ago -- here are the key points: The transfer of debt: 1.1: In the event of Scottish independence from the United Kingdom (UK), the continuing UK Government would in all circumstances honour the contractual terms of the debt issued by the UK Government. An independent Scottish state would become responsible for a fair and proportionate share of the UK\u2019s current liabilities, but a share of the outstanding stock of debt instruments that have been issued by the UK would not be transferred to Scotland. For example, there would be no change in counterparty for holders of UK gilts. Instead, an independent Scotland would need to raise funds in order to reimburse the continuing UK for this share. 1.2: An entirely separate contract between the continuing UK Government and an independent Scottish state\u2019s Government would need to be established. The respective shares of debt and the terms of repayment would be subject to negotiation. 1.3: In the event of independence, the full spectrum of assets and liabilities \u2013 past, future and contingent \u2013 would need to be considered in negotiations between the continuing UK and Scottish Governments, on a case-by-case basis. This means that the negotiations would need to cover the arrangements for all forms of debt covered in this note, not just gilts and Treasury bills. Financial hacks are crunching through the details now: Elsewhere in the eurozone, Portugal's hopes of a credit rating upgrade from Moody's have been dashed, for the moment. Moody's had been expected to update its view on Portugal on January 10, and perhaps raise its outlook to positive from stable. It now says that a decision might not come until May: Here's the statement: \"Should Moody's announce a rating action, we will do so in accordance with regulatory obligations. Note that Moody's Sovereign Release Calendar is indicative of dates for potential action only.\" Moody's currently rates Portugal as Ba3, the third highest junk rating. But its bond prices have rallied strongly in recent weeks -- pushing down the interest rate on its 10-year bonds to just 5.3%.That suggests the market has already given its verdict. While shares rise, the US dollar is being dragged down by last Friday's weak US jobs report The pound is up almost half a cent, to $1.6434. The yen has risen by almost 0.7%, to \u00a5103.4, close to a one-month high. Some investors are calculating that the Federal Reserve will be more cautious about trimming its bond-buying stimulus package, having cut $10bn off the programme in December, to $75bn/month. Interest rates could remain at record lows for even longer. Jeremy Cook, chief economist at World First, explains that: Traders are betting on an extended run of asset purchases through 2014. Cook also fears that the US labour market is still suffering from the freeze: A fair few analysts are blaming the poor weather in the States for the disappointing number; in that case it is only likely to get worse given the \u2018polar vortex\u2019 and the ensuing chaos that it has caused. Italy's manufacturing sector is inching out of its slump, according to new data this morning. Italian industrial output rose for a third month running in November, rising 0.3% month-in-month in November. October's reading was also hiked to +0.7%, from +0.5%. Christmas dinner could be the next outsourcing boom. UK pub chain Greene King has reported that it achieved its best ever sales on Christmas Day, shifting 62,000 meals to diners in paper hats. Greene King enjoys record sales over Christmas period The stock market likes the news, though - Debenham's shares have jumped to the top of the FTSE 250, gaining almost 6%. Experienced retail analyst Nick Bubb warns that Debenhams' image could suffer through a tie-up with Sports Direct: Commenting on SPD's stake-building, Bubb writes: No doubt Mike Ashley has some ideas on how to trade from Debenhams\u2019 surplus store space and he has some experience of making big space retailing work, via the infamous Lillywhites store in Piccadilly Circus. It also well known that he looked briefly at buying House of Fraser at the end of 2012. But dragging Debenhams downmarket and turning it into even more of a discount store may not appeal to retail purists... Mike Ashley has done it again. City analysts are scratching their heads after Ashley's Sports Direct told the City this morning that it had snaffled a near-5% stake in retail chain Debenhams. Sports Direct declared that it wants to work with Debenham's to \"create value\" and plans to be a \"supportive shareholder\". For its part, Debenhams says it is \"open-minded\" about the situation. But what is Ashley up to? Well, Sports Direct owns a range of brands - including Slazenger and Dunlop, so perhaps he hopes to flog 'em through Debenhams too? Or maybe he fancies trading through its stores? Ashley's timing is classic, too -- Debs is already on the back foot after a poor Christmas and the resignation of its chief finance officer. As my colleague Sean Farrell writes, this isn't the first time the Newcastle United owner has popped up on a rival's share register: Ashley has a record of buying stakes in other companies and putting pressure on management, including former rival JJB Sports and Black Leisure. Late last year he threatened to buy 5% of Adidas after the sporting goods company refused to let Sports Direct stock Chelsea FC kits. Here's the full story: Sports Direct buys 4.63% stake in Debenhams Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of events across the financial markets, the economy, the eurozone and the business world. It's a calm start to the week, as investors continue to chew on last Friday's surprisingly weak US jobs report. Stock markets in Asia were generally subdued, and the main European markets are inching higher in early trading, despite the nasty surprise at the end of last week when December's American employment data hits the wires. We've had a weekend to digest Non-Farm Payrolls -- which showed that just 74,000 new jobs were created, not the 200k expected, with record numbers of Americans giving up looking for work at all. There's broad agreement this morning that there's no reason to panic. As Michael Hewson of CMC puts it: While investors were left scratching their heads at why Friday\u2019s number was so poor the general consensus appears to be that the number could be a bit of an outlier, which could well be revised higher next month, while some analysts have suggested that the weather could well have played a part. In which case, January's payroll data could be pretty weak too, given the ice storms that hit the US recently. Despite the uncertainty, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index closed up 0.2%, and shares are a little higher in Europe in the first few minutes of trading [corrected]. FTSE 100: up 10 points at 6750, +0.1% German DAX: up 31 points at 9504, +0.33% French CAC: up 14 points at 4262, +0.33% Fears that the US economy was weaker than expected are being balanced by predictions that the US Federal Reserve could conduct more stimulus measures than the markets had expected. The gold price has risen overnight, gaining 0.3% to $1.250 per ounce. The question of \"what the Fed will do\" is complicated by the US unemployment rate taking a surprise drop to just 6.7% (mainly because more Americans quit the labour force altogether). Chris Weston of IG reckons that the Fed will not read too much into one month's data: The US payrolls report has been cut, diced and sliced over the weekend and what exactly the numbers mean for the pace of tapering and whether the market\u2019s roadmap, that QE will be cut $10 billion a month, is still the high probability scenario. The comments from outgoing St Louis Fed president James Bullard after the payrolls print suggests the Fed (and the market) will look past this shocking jobs print, with the view that one jobs report does not make a trend. But for a more gloomy view of the situation, we have Marc Ostwald of Monument Securities who suggests the markets are fighting reality (as usual?). He writes that: The overarching theme remains the conflict between the eternal optimism that bedevils the start of each year in financial markets, (which took a sharp slap in the face at the end of last week in the case of the UK and the USA), the gnawing fear that the great experiment with unconventional central bank policy measures (which is ostensibly are its denouement) has been little more than a palliative for the woes that afflict the real economies of the developed world as a consequence of the financial crisis, amid a dawning but heftily resisted realisation that the economic models that have underpinned central bank and political policy models are based on assumptions that are at best flawed, if not bogus. Optimism is trumping realism, for now at least..... Also coming up this morning --- surprise developments in UK retail, with Sports Direct taking a stake in Debenhams; reports overnight that the UK will take full responsibility for all Britain's national debt if Scotland votes for independence; and French energy giant Total confirming major plans for shale gas fracking in the UK. I'll be tracking all the main developments through the day...",

But Clive Black at Shore Capital said:</p> <blockquote> Whilst there can be short-term gains for shareholders from a comprehensive property sale programme through distributions, we question whether such activity is in the interest of the company in the long-run; will the shareholders that may seek short-term radical action be there for the duration?

      "bodyText": "After Morrisons' underwhelming update last week, the supermarket group is back in focus on renewed talk of an asset sale to boost shareholder value, despite continuing worries about it losing out to discounters like Aldi and Lidl. Weekend reports suggested an activist US investor, Elliott Associates, was pushing Morrisons to sell some off its property assets. But Clive Black at Shore Capital said: Whilst there can be short-term gains for shareholders from a comprehensive property sale programme through distributions, we question whether such activity is in the interest of the company in the long-run; will the shareholders that may seek short-term radical action be there for the duration?

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Detroit auto show opened Monday with manufacturers announcing a fleet of new models amid an air of optimism unseen since before the recession. Over 5,000 journalists arrived at the Cobo Center in downtown Detroit for the 25th North American International Auto Show and close to 800,000 visitors are expected when the show opens to the public later this week. Organisers estimate the show will contribute $365m to the struggling local economy in wages and other spending. The opening ceremonies for the show took place in the striking new Cobo Conference Center atrium, lit by a four-storey high glass window overlooking the Detroit River \u2013 the jewel of the $279m upgrade of the center. \"The auto industry's back,\" US transportation secretary Anthony Foxx told reporters, \"And of course, we're going to do everything we can to help Detroit come back as well.\" All three major US car firms are using this year\u2019s show to unveil major new vehicles they hope will power their future success after strong growth in 2013. Car sales have remained up even as the data on other consumer purchases have wobbled. On Monday Ford unveiled its next generation F-150, the US\u2019s best selling vehicle, adding new technology and fuel efficiency into the full-size pickup truck. Sales of the F-150 plummeted during the recession. The truck is often used in construction and bought in fleets by government departments. Sales collapsed as gas prices rose and the recession bit. The new F-150 comes with an aluminum body and weighs 700lbs less than the current model. The company said it would make the truck the most energy efficient F-150 ever. GM\u2019s incoming chief Mary Barra made her first public appearance since her appointment Sunday night, unveiling the GMC Canyon, a midsize pickup. She said she was \u201chonored to stand here tonight and humbly lead this team\u201d. GM\u2019s Chevrolet Stingray was named car of the year at the show Monday morning. Chrysler, clear of bankruptcy and finalising its merger with Fiat, also unveiled a fleet of new vehicles including new versions of its 200 family sedan and the Dart. Toyota is introducing eight completely new or updated models this year and expects to sell 2.3m vehicles in the US, about 100,000 more than it sold in 2013. Speaking as Ford announced it was launching 16 new models in 2014 \u2013 the most in a decade \u2013 Bill Ford, executive chairman, said: \u201cThere\u2019s a general air of optimism lots of new product by all manufacturers is being introduced here, It\u2019s great for the city and it\u2019s great for the industry.\u201d Sergio Marchionne, CEO of Fiat and Chrysler, said: \u201cWe are running three shifts, we are running seven days a week, we are running overtime.\u201d Last year 15.5m vehicles were sold in the US, up from 14.4m in 2012. The figure was the best in six years. IHS Automotive estimates sales will top 16.1m this year. It\u2019s a remarkable turnaround for an industry some were writing off just a few years ago. Of the US\u2019s big three car firms, only Ford managed to avoid bankruptcy and massive government bailouts. They have since recovered to report record profits. Ford has now reported 17 straight quarters of profits and chief executive Alan Mulally said the company expected to add 11,000 people to its payroll this year. Veteran independent auto industry analyst Michelle Krebs said: \u201cThe mood is very upbeat. We are coming off the best year for sales since 2007 with the expectation that next year is going to be better yet. I saw IHS was projecting that there would be 59 new vehicles at the show, that\u2019s the most we have seen in years.\u201d Jessica Caldwell, senior analyst at Edmunds.com, said the car manufacturers had been careful to roll out \u201csomething for everyone\u201d this year. She said it was clear that fuel efficiency was still a key factor for drivers and the industry was taking note. \u201cThere\u2019s new trucks, subcompacts, mid-sized vehicles. If the market changes direction, they want to be ready, which was clearly one of the criticisms about them when the market turned last time.\u201d The renaissance in the auto industry comes at Detroit still struggles with bankruptcy. The city filed for the largest ever municipal bankruptcy last year and a judge is now assessing those bankruptcy plans. Speaking at the auto show Marchionne said: \u201cI sincerely hope that the issues surrounding this bankruptcy are resolved. I think the city deserves that.\u201d He said the city and the car industry would have been in \u201cdeep doo doo\u201d if the two had gone bust at the same time.",

Organisers estimate the show will contribute $365m to the struggling local economy in wages and other spending.</p> <p>The opening ceremonies for the show took place in the striking new Cobo Conference Center atrium, lit by a four-storey high glass window overlooking the Detroit River \u2013 the jewel of the $279m upgrade of the center.</p> <p>\"The auto industry's back,\" US transportation secretary Anthony Foxx told reporters, \"And of course, we're going to do everything we can to help Detroit come back as well.\"</p> <p>All three major US car firms are using this year\u2019s show to unveil major new vehicles they hope will power their future success after strong growth in 2013.&#xa0;Car sales have remained up even as the data on other consumer purchases have wobbled.</p> <p>On Monday Ford unveiled its next generation F-150, the US\u2019s best selling vehicle, adding new technology and fuel efficiency into the full-size pickup truck. Sales of the F-150 plummeted during the recession. The truck is often used in construction and bought in fleets by government departments. Sales collapsed as gas prices rose and the recession bit.</p> <p>The new F-150 comes with an aluminum body and weighs 700lbs less than the current model. The company said it would make the truck the most energy efficient F-150 ever.</p> <p>GM\u2019s incoming chief Mary Barra made her first public appearance since her appointment Sunday night, unveiling the GMC Canyon, a midsize pickup. She said she was \u201chonored to stand here tonight and humbly lead this team\u201d. GM\u2019s Chevrolet Stingray was named car of the year at the show Monday morning.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-0a52286f-9a8c-472d-b2d5-6a6035f76055\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/13/1389627951192/f03687f2-fd99-4944-9b6b-ef1e062bef0d-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Ford F-150 pickup\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The all-new Ford F-150 aluminium pickup truck introduced at the 2014 NAIAS. Photograph: James Fassinger/Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Chrysler, clear of bankruptcy and finalising its merger with Fiat, also unveiled a fleet of new vehicles including new versions of its 200 family sedan and the Dart.</p> <p>Toyota is introducing eight completely new or updated models this year and expects to sell 2.3m vehicles in the US, about 100,000 more than it sold in 2013.</p> <p>Speaking as Ford announced it was launching 16 new models in 2014 \u2013 the most in a decade \u2013 Bill Ford, executive chairman, said: \u201cThere\u2019s a general air of optimism lots of new product by all manufacturers is being introduced here, It\u2019s great for the city and it\u2019s great for the industry.\u201d</p> <p>Sergio Marchionne, CEO of Fiat and Chrysler, said: \u201cWe are running three shifts, we are running seven days a week, we are running overtime.\u201d</p> <p>Last year 15.5m vehicles were sold in the US, up from 14.4m in 2012. The figure was the best in six years. IHS Automotive estimates sales will top 16.1m this year.&#xa0;It\u2019s a remarkable turnaround for an industry some were writing off just a few years ago.</p> <p>Of the US\u2019s big three car firms, only Ford managed to avoid bankruptcy and massive government bailouts. They have since recovered to report record profits. Ford has now reported 17 straight quarters of profits and chief executive Alan Mulally said the company expected to add 11,000 people to its payroll this year.</p> <p>Veteran independent auto industry analyst Michelle Krebs said: \u201cThe mood is very upbeat. We are coming off the best year for sales since 2007 with the expectation that next year is going to be better yet. I saw IHS was projecting that there would be 59 new vehicles at the show, that\u2019s the most we have seen in years.\u201d</p> <p>Jessica Caldwell, senior analyst at Edmunds.com, said the car manufacturers had been careful to roll out \u201csomething for everyone\u201d this year. She said it was clear that fuel efficiency was still a key factor for drivers and the industry was taking note.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s new trucks, subcompacts, mid-sized vehicles. If the market changes direction, they want to be ready, which was clearly one of the criticisms about them when the market turned last time.\u201d</p> <p>The renaissance in the auto industry comes at Detroit still struggles with bankruptcy. The city filed for the largest ever municipal bankruptcy last year and a judge is now assessing those bankruptcy plans.</p> <p>Speaking at the auto show Marchionne said: \u201cI sincerely hope that the issues surrounding this bankruptcy are resolved. I think the city deserves that.\u201d He said the city and the car industry would have been in \u201cdeep doo doo\u201d if the two had gone bust at the same time.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-8e66432f-d1c3-4609-a11d-280c15c144f1\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/13/1389627736608/6fa5d3e0-6fca-442b-b094-f57a0ff5462c-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Ford F-150 pickup truck\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The all-new Ford F-150 aluminium pickup truck revealed at the 2014 NAIAS.
