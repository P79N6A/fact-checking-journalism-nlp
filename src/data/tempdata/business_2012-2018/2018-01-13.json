      "bodyText": "What is it about negative gearing and its ability to make conservative governments espouse absurdities and to ignore advice? This week came the news that before the 2016 election, Malcolm Turnbull and Scott Morrison were making claims about the impact of the Labor party\u2019s negative gearing policy that directly contradicted advice from the Treasury. This was followed on Thursday by Fairfax revealing that the New South Wales government had ignored the advice of its own treasury department that negative gearing was pushing up house prices. Negative gearing is the economic equivalent of a migrant crime story \u2013 something conservative political parties believe they can use to scare voters despite little or no relation to facts. And the facts certainly show that the ALP\u2019s policy of limiting negative gearing to new housing and halving the capital gains discount will produce little to be scared about. Those who will most be affected, according to the treasury department, come from the top 20% \u2013 and that might give some insight into why conservative political parties and media organisations cling to the policy. To be honest, it was always pretty obvious that what Turnbull was saying about the ALP\u2019s housing policy would have made some pretty powerful fertiliser. The prime minister, for example, in April that year referred to the ALP\u2019s policy as a \u201chousing tax\u201d that was \u201ca big sledgehammer they are taking to the property market\u201d that would \u201cdevalue every home, every property, in Australia\u201d. Yep. Every home. Every property. And while at the time it was clear his assertions lacked rigor, we now know he too knew this. A briefing document, first produced under FOI to the ABC this week, revealed that the Treasury had advised the government that the ALP\u2019s housing policy might merely cause \u201csome downward pressure on property prices\u201d in the short term and that in the long term it could have \u201ca relatively modest downward impact\u201d on prices. That the Treasury was advising the government of this should not be a shock, and neither is discovering that the prime minister and treasurer were scaremongering and ignoring advice. Such news is merely \u2013 to use a favourite expression of the prime minister\u2019s \u2013 a penetrating glimpse of the obvious. Turnbull also suggested Labor\u2019s policy would affect commercial property despite the Treasury saying it wouldn\u2019t. Whereas the prime minister told the Australian public that \u201cwhat Labor clearly wants is for there to be less investment in Australia because they are jacking up the tax on investment\u201d, the Treasury advised that \u201cin fact the impact of the policy on investments in other asset classes, such as shares, may see investment in owner-occupier housing increase\u201d. That the prime minister and treasurer have been found to ignore advice is a worry, but it is pleasing to discover that at least their idiotic ramblings on the issue were not based on advice from the Treasury. Most likely the next step for the government \u2013 one already earmarked by conservative media outlets such as the Australian \u2013 will be to argue that the advice shows the ALP\u2019s policy is pointless because it won\u2019t have a big impact. No doubt they will shift to the impact on rents and argue that while it may not smash house prices it will (to quote the prime minister from his April 2016 doorstop) \u201cdrive up rents\u201d. Fortunately, here we don\u2019t need to wait on another FOI request of Treasury advice, because we already have such advice based on evidence. In the 1980s, when the Hawke government did remove negative gearing, the impact on rental prices was decidedly mixed \u2013 they increased in Sydney and Perth but stayed flat elsewhere. And the release of the 1987 cabinet papers four years ago revealed that the Treasury then advised the Hawke government that the increase in rental prices in Sydney and Perth was because \u201clocal influences rather than tax measures dominate in metropolitan rental markets\u201d. Essentially, before the removal of negative gearing in 1985, there was a shortage of rental accommodation in Sydney and Perth, and that was why rents rose in just those two cities. But I doubt such facts will matter \u2013 they certainly haven\u2019t bothered the prime minister or treasurer so far. Neither will, I suspect, a study presented at a Reserve Bank conference, which found that the removal of negative gearing (something the ALP is not even proposing) would \u201clead to an overall welfare gain of 1.5% for the Australian economy in which 76% of households become better off\u201d. That study, which argues increases in rent could be more than offset by increased government transfers coming from more tax revenue, suggest the winners of removing negative gearing would be \u201crenters and owner-occupiers\u201d but \u201clandlords, especially young with high earning landlords, lose\u201d. This is in agreement with the Treasury\u2019s assessment that \u201cnegative gearing benefits high income families\u201d and that the capital gains tax discount \u201coverwhelmingly benefits high income families\u201d. Once again, this is not new \u2013 given the publicly available tax data to argue that anything else requires one to be relatively unconcerned about facts. And facts are not the government\u2019s strong suit on this issue. \u2022 Greg Jericho is a Guardian Australia columnist \u2022 On 15 January 2018 this column was amended.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The crisis at Carillion threatens to engulf the government as opposition parties question the decision to continue awarding public sector contracts to the services and construction giant when ministers knew it was in trouble. Whitehall departments are holding emergency meetings this weekend to discuss contingency plans if the Wolverhampton-based firm, which is integral to a raft of public infrastructure projects including HS2 and several major road schemes, is forced into administration. Reports that the company\u2019s proposed plan to turn around its fortunes has been rejected outright by stakeholders, which include three leading banks \u2013 Barclays, HSBC and Santander UK, have been played down. However, time is running out for a deal to be struck and there are claims that Carillion could be placed in the hands of administrators Ernst &amp; Young as early as Monday. Such a move would raise serious questions about a raft of government contracts awarded to Carillion. \u201cIt has been clear for months that Carillion has been in difficulty but the government has continued to hand over contracts to the company even after profits warnings were issued,\u201d said MP Jon Trickett, Labour\u2019s shadow Cabinet Office minister. \u201cJobs and public services are now at risk because the Tories were blinded by their commitment to a failing ideological project of introducing the profit motive into taxpayer-funded services. Labour urges the government to stand ready to intervene and bring these crucial public sector contracts back in-house in order to protect Carillion\u2019s employees, pension holders and British taxpayers.\u201d Chris Grayling, the transport secretary, is facing the most pressure. Last year, his department awarded a consortium, which included Carillion, a share of contracts for the HS2 line, just a week after the company issued a shock profit warning that marked the start of its crisis. At the time, Grayling said he had been given \u201csecure undertakings\u201d from the company. Whitehall insiders stressed that the HS2 contracts had been \u201cstress tested\u201d to ensure that if one contractor pulled out, others in the consortium were able to fill the gap. But Andrew Adonis, the former chair of the government\u2019s national infrastructure committee, said: \u201cIt looks as if Chris Grayling may have been bailing out Carillion as well as Virgin. They got HS2 contracts from him after their troubles emerged in the summer, raising big questions about his due diligence and judgment.\u201d Carillion, which has debts of about \u00a31.5bn and a pension fund shortfall of almost \u00a3600m, is proposing that the banks swap their debts for majority equity stakes in the business. But a more urgent sticking point, the Observer understands, is the need for a \u00a3300m cash injection to keep the business afloat. With the banks balking at stumping up more cash, there is speculation that the government may have to step in to guarantee Carillion\u2019s short term future. The Lib Dem leader, Vince Cable, rejected such a move: \u201cThe government can\u2019t just do a financial bailout. The shareholders and the creditors \u2013 the big banks \u2013 have got to take a hit, they can\u2019t just offload all of the losses on to the taxpayer.\u201d The company, which employs 43,000 people globally, is Highways England\u2019s second-biggest supplier by value of contracts, according to Construction News. The firm is also Network Rail\u2019s second-largest contractor, winning work worth \u00a3372m last year. Rachel Reeves, the Labour MP who chairs the business select committee, called on the government to make a Commons statement on Monday. \u201cThey need to explain what they knew and when, as well as what they are going to do now to protect jobs, public services, crucial infrastructure investment \u2013 but also taxpayers,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t think that taxpayers\u2019 money should be used to prop it up. Investors have known for some time of the difficulties here. Taxpayers should not have to bail out this company.\u201d Several government agencies rallied to the company\u2019s defence on Saturday. A Network Rail spokesman said: \u201cCarillion is a good supplier to Network Rail and has a number of contracts across the country. Carillion\u2019s delivery performance is strong and we enjoy an open, honest and constructive relationship.\u201d David Poole, executive director for procurement and commercial, Highways England, said the company was \u201cdelivering a number of key projects in our major project portfolio\u201d. Last year Carillion had sales of \u00a35.2bn and was valued at almost \u00a31bn. But since then its share price has plummeted and it is now worth around \u00a360m. Experts said it is paying the price for overreaching itself. A government spokeswoman said: \u201cThe company has kept us informed of the steps it is taking to restructure the business. We remain supportive of their discussions with their stakeholders and await future updates on their progress.\u201d \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

They got HS2 contracts from him after their troubles emerged in the summer, raising big questions about his due diligence and judgment.\u201d</p> \n<p>Carillion, which has debts of about \u00a31.5bn and a pension fund shortfall of almost \u00a3600m, is proposing that the banks swap their debts for majority equity stakes in the business. </p> \n<p>But a more urgent sticking point, the Observer understands, is the need for a \u00a3300m cash injection to keep the business afloat. With the banks balking at stumping up more cash, there is speculation that the government may have to step in to guarantee Carillion\u2019s short term future.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/10/government-carillion-collapse-contingency-plans\">Government admits plans in place for Carillion collapse</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The Lib Dem leader, Vince Cable, rejected such a move: \u201cThe government can\u2019t just do a financial bailout.

      "bodyText": "The vast Carillion construction and public services group was fighting for survival this weekend as management, the government and lenders to the stricken construction services firm were locked in rescue talks. The company is bleeding cash from several contracts that have turned sour and it is struggling under the weight of \u00a31.5bn of debt, including a huge \u00a3590m pension deficit. Professor Karel Williams at Manchester University noted that Carillion had turned from a construction company into an outsourcing conglomerate, which was, he said, \u201ca bad idea\u201d. Williams added: \u201cWith outsourcing, you have to continually bid for new contracts, and the stock market expects to see continuous growth. But sooner or later you take on a contract that makes huge losses and the operation can\u2019t sustain those losses. \u201cThere are problems when you move past being a specialist outsourcer. Many conglomerates just churn through contracts and move into areas they don\u2019t understand, until their luck runs out. This was an accident waiting to happen.\u201d Carillion employs 43,000 workers, including nearly 20,000 in the UK, and is one of the UK government\u2019s biggest contractors. It works on the high-profile HS2 project, it builds, maintains and operates hospitals for the NHS, and manages nearly 900 schools. The crisis gained momentum in recent days. On Wednesday, the company presented a potential rescue plan to its lenders. On Thursday, there was a meeting of key government ministers to decide on contingency plans if collapse could not be avoided. On Friday, there were more meetings with the pensions regulator, to assess the threat to the company\u2019s pensioners and pension scheme members. A collapse would be disastrous for the government and, potentially, costly to the public purse. The threat to Carillion is so acute that audit heavyweight EY was placed on standby on Friday to step in as administrator if banks and the government could not thrash out a deal to save the firm. EY was said to be favoured by the company\u2019s directors, possibly because Lee Watson, a partner at the audit giant, is on secondment to Carillion, acting as a director and as the contractor\u2019s chief transformation officer. The rescue plan shown to lenders last week included handing back some loss-making contracts, revamping others and accepting financial support from the government. But it is understood that Carillion\u2019s main lenders \u2013 Barclays, HSBC and Santander UK \u2013 have indicated they are reluctant to provide additional funding because they are already exposed to huge potential losses. A solution could be a debt-for-equity swap and the government guaranteeing its loans, which would shield lenders from losses in the event of a collapse. The company\u2019s parlous financial state was revealed last year, when it said borrowings were piling up and that it was making losses on key contracts. That meant it would have to write off \u00a3800m and suspend its dividend. A plan to raise \u00a3300m through sell-offs by the end of 2018 has so far only delivered \u00a350m. The group\u2019s market value has shrunk from \u00a32bn after it was formed from the construction divisions of Tarmac, Wimpey, Mowlem and Alfred McAlpine, to just \u00a361m at Friday\u2019s close. The shares, which just two years ago were changing hands at around 300p, closed on Friday at just 14.2p \u2013 down nearly 30% on the day, as fears of total collapse heightened. A construction industry expert said part of Carillion\u2019s problem had been that it had lacked focus. He said: \u201cOne minute it\u2019s pulling out of construction altogether in order to focus on services. Then it changes its mind when it thinks it can make some money in construction again. It\u2019s been a bit of a mess.\u201d The group\u2019s chief executive, Richard Howson, quit last July, after the first of three profit warnings in four months. Three public finance initiative schemes, which are late and over budget, are partly responsible for the blow-up at Carillion \u2013 the \u00a3350m Midland Metropolitan hospital in Birmingham, the \u00a3335m Royal Liverpool University hospital and the \u00a3745m Aberdeen bypass. In the case of the Royal Liverpool hospital, it is at least a year behind schedule. It was due to be completed in March 2017 but, according to industry website Construction Enquirer, the discovery last year of cracks in two concrete beams, which required significant remedial work, pushed the handover date back. Last week, it emerged the project had been hit by a further setback that means the new 28 February completion date will again be missed by the contractor. At a time when the NHS is at breaking point, the potential collapse of a key private partner is a shocking prospect. According to Carillion\u2019s website, it is \u201cone of the largest providers of facilities management to the NHS\u201d. It employs about 8,000 people in the healthcare division; its engineering teams carry out about 200,000 maintenance tasks on about 1m square metres of NHS space; the buildings that Carillion is responsible for include 200 operating theatres, with 300 critical-care beds and just under 11,500 in-patient beds; it prepares more than 18,500 patient meals per day; and the firm\u2019s NHS helpdesks manage more than 1.5m calls each year. The scale of its work for the NHS \u2013 without even considering work it does for the Ministry of Defence or Prison Service \u2013 is enough to focus the minds of ministers on a rescue deal. Williams noted: \u201cThe whole rationale for PPP (public private partnership) \u2013 where Carillion has been a big player in the UK \u2013 is that, notionally, you transfer risk to the company that takes the contract. But, fundamentally, the limit of that risk is the balance sheet of the outsourcing company. If you move beyond that, it becomes a crisis for the government.\u201d Carillion, like many other outsourcing and service companies, relies on long-term contracts. In the case of building and operating a school or a hospital, there is a lot of expense and a lot of risk involved at the construction stage. But contractors reap the rewards on the 20- or 30-year management and maintenance deals that follow, which provide some comfort and clarity over future earnings. Ideally, firms would spread the work so that new deals replace contracts that are just about to end. However, this is rarely the case and debt is often required to plug the gaps in the lumpy cashflow cycle. The danger is that if something goes wrong with a contract, and it doesn\u2019t make as much money, or even loses money, it suddenly becomes more difficult to finance those large borrowings. Williams urged ministers to cast a more critical eye over future outsourcing deals between the government and private firms. \u201cWe should have offered them a management contract, because the government can borrow more cheaply,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the Treasury doesn\u2019t want the debt on the government\u2019s books. So it passes the problem to somebody else \u2013 until it goes wrong.\u201d This weekend, it seemed to be going wrong in spectacular style \u2013 and thousands of jobs, pensions and key public services now look to be at risk. \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s beginning to look a lot like Christmas for US retailers, but not if you\u2019re a woman working for one. Company sales reports are coming in and so far they indicate the holiday season was a big success. At the same time evidence is emerging that the radical reordering of the retail landscape is hitting women hard, and there may be worse to come. The retail sector has been the biggest loser of jobs for the last two years in a row in the US, as thousands of stores closed as shoppers moved online. It remains one of the US\u2019s largest employers, providing 15.8m jobs, but the reordering of the retail landscape is having a profound impact on the nature of its workforce. Between November 2016 and November 2017, the sector fired 129,000 women (the largest loss for any industrial sector for either sex) while men gained 109,000 positions, according to an analysis by the Institute for Women\u2019s Policy Research (IWPR). In the whole labour force women gained 985,000 jobs over the year, while men gained 1.08m jobs. Retail remains a \u201chugely important\u201d employer for women, said Heidi Hartmann, IWPR president, especially as a provider of part-time jobs for women who are looking to balance work with family obligations. \u201cWomen are very dependent on the nearby shopping center and retail outlets especially as they get back into the work market.\u201d But the shift in how Americans shop \u2013 and in what they are buying \u2013 is having a profound effect. Major retailers shut shops across the US last year. A record 6,700 stores shut in 2017, according to Fung Global Retail &amp; Technology, a retail thinktank. Macy\u2019s alone closed 68 stores and shed 10,000 jobs. Drugstore chain Walgreens closed 600 locations. New jobs are being created in shipping, handling, back office and warehousing but traditional retail is being hollowed out with the loss of checkout and sales assistant jobs. \u201cThere are still jobs being created in retail but they are jobs with different skill sets,\u201d said Andrew Challenger, vice-president of outplacement experts Challenger, Gray and Christmas. But despite those gains \u201cthere is real job loss going on and we may not see those jobs coming back. In many cases these jobs are being lost in places where retailers are the largest employers in the area.\u201d Challenger described the losses as one of the most dramatic changes in the jobs market the US had witnessed since manufacturing was rocked by outsourcing and automation. Hartmann said there were some similarities with the hollowing out of manufacturing. \u201cWomen lost jobs in manufacturing first. They had the easiest jobs to ship abroad \u2013 clothing, textiles \u2013 and the men had the jobs that did eventually get shipped abroad but were more difficult to move, like cars, with big transportation costs.\u201d She pointed out that women are still the majority recipients of the trade assistance adjustment act \u2013 benefits that are given to US workers for retraining if they lose their employment because of international trade. But she said other factors were also at play. The recovery of \u201cconsumer durable\u201d sales \u2013 which are sales of big ticket items such as cars and home appliances \u2013 have bounced back and men hold more of the retail jobs in those sectors. \u201cWhen you have a long, slow recovery most people have put off renewing their washing machine, their fridge, their car and now they are feeling that they can start those purchases again. And it seems like they want to see those goods at the store. And those stores offer services, taking away old appliances, installing the new one. Less of those orders are being done online. And there have always been more men in those sectors,\u201d she said. The Amazon effect too is hurting women more than men. Alongside store closures in non-durable goods \u2013 food and clothing for example \u2013 retailers are experimenting with ways to remove checkout positions, jobs where women dominate. The numbers now are \u201cnoisy\u201d; the new shape of retail is still in flux and positions created by online retailing are not always categorized as retail in the government jobs figures. But the trend so far looks worrying for women. \u201cIt\u2019s a stunning thing to show women have lost more than 100,000 jobs over the year and men have gained almost as many. It does look like coal in the stocking for Christmas for many women workers,\u201d said Hartmann. \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

    "webTitle": "Tencent, the $500bn Chinese tech firm you may never have heard of", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "It is China\u2019s web giant and has a string of high-profile investments spanning Snapchat, Spotify, Tesla and Hollywood film and TV. It is a sprawling corporate giant that has recently overtaken Facebook to become the world\u2019s fifth most valuable listed company \u2013 but few, in the west at least, will have heard of Tencent, even though it is worth half a trillion dollars and rising. China is the world\u2019s most populous digital market and the protection afforded by state censorship through the so-called great firewall \u2013 which has meant no competition from Facebook, Google, Twitter and Netflix \u2013 has helped Tencent flourish since it launched nearly two decades ago in Shenzhen. But in the last year the shares have been supercharged \u2013 climbing from less than HK$200 (\u00a318) at the beginning of 2017 to HK$442 now \u2013 and the value of the company has soared. There are three cornerstones of Tencent\u2019s business \u2013 its messaging app WeChat; the biggest mobile gaming franchises in the world; and an ecosystem built around its 1 billion users that apes many of the services offered by the Silicon Valley firms that do not operate in China. The company\u2019s Netflix-style Tencent Video service \u2013 the biggest in China with exclusive content including NFL games and HBO series such as Game of Thrones \u2013 more than doubled in size in the last year, attracting more than 40 million paying subscribers. \u201cThey have a relationship of mutual benefit with the Chinese state,\u201d says Jamie McEwan, an analyst at Enders. \u201cThey have been allowed to grow and massively diversify their businesses without the level of scrutiny or competition you might see in western countries.\u201d Late last year, Tencent became the first Chinese firm to pass the $500bn stock market valuation mark, supplanting Facebook as the world\u2019s fifth biggest firm, a bittersweet moment for company co-founder Ma Huateng, 46, also known as \u201cPony\u201d Ma. In 2014, Tencent had been on the brink of buying What\u2019sApp, which would have made it a global power player overnight. The company was close to a deal when talks had to be delayed so that Ma could undergo back surgery. A panicked Mark Zuckerberg got wind of the move and swooped, tabling an enormous $19bn rival bid \u2013 by far Facebook\u2019s biggest deal and more than twice the offer made by Tencent \u2013 to see off the threat. Thwarted but undeterred, late last year Ma took a 12% holding in Snapchat (he had made a small investment in 2013) in a busy year that also included buying 5% of Elon Musk\u2019s electric car firm Tesla and swapping minority stakes in its music streaming business with Spotify. Tencent Music, which dwarfs efforts by Apple and Spotify in China, is expected to make a $10bn stock market listing this year. Tencent also cranked up its domination of mobile gaming, handing over $8.6bn for the Finnish company Supercell, maker of two of the biggest games in the world, Clash of Clans and Clash Royale. It also owns the Los Angeles game-maker Riot, behind the huge League of Legends franchise, and has stakes in Gears of War maker Epic and Activision Blizzard, home to Call of Duty, World of Warcraft and Candy Crush Saga. Tencent also owns the most profitable game in the world, Honour of Kings, which makes about $1bn a quarter and has 200 million monthly players. It has proved so addictive in games-mad China that the government warned Tencent in an article in the state-owned People\u2019s Daily last year saying it was \u201cpoison\u201d and a \u201cdrug\u201d that harms kids. The risk of a government crackdown on one (or more) of Tencent\u2019s golden geese \u2013 the company relies on gaming for more than 40% of total revenues \u2013 spurred jittery investors to wipe almost $18bn off its stock market value. Tencent swiftly introduced one-hour time limits for under-12s and two hours for 12- to 18-year-olds. Analysts estimate that Tencent digital services are used by more than two-thirds of the Chinese population. Chinese users collectively spend 1.7bn hours a day on the company\u2019s apps. The business started in cramped Shenzhen offices in the late 1990s, swiftly developing a bad reputation for cloning digital products for the Chinese market, but it was the launch of WeChat in 2011 that supercharged the company\u2019s strategy. The WeChat eco-system is so broad it is almost like rolling most of the apps on a typical western user\u2019s mobile phone into one. \u201cIt is compared to What\u2019s App or Facebook messenger but it is not really,\u201d says Xiaofeng Wang, a Singapore-based analyst with Forrester. \u201cIt has payment systems, smart city offerings such as the ability to schedule appointments at a bank, a doctor, pay traffic fines or make visa applications and e-commerce.\u201d Tencent\u2019s ambition to be an essential part of digital daily life means it holds a dizzyingly diverse range of interests including in Didi, China\u2019s answer to Uber, the nation\u2019s second biggest e-tailer JD.com and Hike, a messaging service popular in India. In December, it even did an Amazon, which has gone real-world buying retailer Whole Foods, taking a stake in one of China\u2019s largest supermarket chains, Yonghui Superstores. It also has a stake in Hollywood film distributor STX Entertainment, behind movies such as Bad Moms and All The Money in the World, while movie arm Tencent Pictures was a backer of blockbuster Kong: Skull Island. \u201cThe ultimate goal of all their investments is to enhance the services they have already developed, to support the eco-system,\u201d says Ruomeng Wang, senior analyst at IHS Markit. The protected market conditions that have allowed Tencent to flourish, and the vast differences between Chinese and foreign internet users\u2019 web habits, has seen the company struggle abroad. Seven years after launching WeChat it is yet to break into any other market, although it has earmarked Malaysia. Analysts believe a key focus will be on targeting the huge numbers of Chinese diaspora and tourists by making WeChat features like payment available overseas, rather than try and make the app a fully-fledged Facebook rival. The payment system is already available in places like Harrods and Selfridges. \u201cWeChat and Tencent tried aggressively expanding into international markets like South America, Europe and even the US but it didn\u2019t work out so well in mainstream western markets where existing players like What\u2019s App are so established,\u201d says Forrester\u2019s Wang. \u201cTheir global expansion will in some places target Chinese travellers, with different strategies in emerging markets like South East Asia.\u201d Tencent facts It is ironic that a company worth over $500bn happens to be called Tencent, which translates into English as \u201csoaring information\u201d. Co-founder Ma Huateng, nickname Pony Ma, is the 14th richest person in the world with a fortune of almost $50bn, one place below Google co-founder Sergey Brin. Befitting its status as a global tech giant the company is aping its Silicon Valley rivals with a new $600m twin skyscraper headquarters. Tencent is one of three Chinese internet behemoths, including Baidu and Alibaba, known collectively as BAT. China\u2019s answer to Silicon Valley\u2019s power club known as the FANGs - Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google. Each year every Tencent employee, more than half of whom are employed in research and design, is given the chance to participate in a company-wide singing competition and to \u201cshine brightly on stage\u201d. Pony Ma is deputy of the National People\u2019s Congress, China\u2019s legislative branch of government, politically useful in a country renowned for cracking down on businesses that get offside with Beijing. \u2022Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

A panicked Mark Zuckerberg got wind of the move and swooped, tabling an enormous $19bn rival bid \u2013 by far Facebook\u2019s biggest deal and more than twice the offer made by Tencent \u2013 to see off the threat.</p> <p>Thwarted but undeterred, late last year Ma took a 12% holding in Snapchat (he had made a small investment in 2013) in a busy year that also included buying 5% of Elon Musk\u2019s electric car firm Tesla and swapping minority stakes in its music streaming business with Spotify.</p> <p>Tencent Music, which dwarfs efforts by Apple and Spotify in China, is expected to make a $10bn stock market listing this year.</p> <p>Tencent also cranked up its domination of mobile gaming, handing over $8.6bn for the Finnish company Supercell, maker of two of the biggest games in the world, Clash of Clans and Clash Royale.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3116234bdc2f40341a008075adc34c5e288c37f8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3116234bdc2f40341a008075adc34c5e288c37f8/0_8_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gamers play \u2018World of Warcraft\u2019 in Cologne, Germany.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gamers play \u2018World of Warcraft\u2019 in Cologne, Germany.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Oliver Berg/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It also owns the Los Angeles game-maker Riot, behind the huge League of Legends franchise, and has stakes in Gears of War maker Epic and Activision Blizzard, home to Call of Duty, World of Warcraft and Candy Crush Saga.</p> <p>Tencent also owns the most profitable game in the world, Honour of Kings, which makes about $1bn a quarter and has 200 million monthly players.</p> <p>It has proved so addictive in games-mad China that the government warned Tencent in an article in the state-owned People\u2019s Daily last year saying it was \u201cpoison\u201d and a \u201cdrug\u201d that harms kids.</p> <p>The risk of a government crackdown on one (or more) of Tencent\u2019s golden geese \u2013 the company relies on gaming for more than 40% of total revenues \u2013 spurred jittery investors to wipe almost $18bn off its stock market value. Tencent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jul/04/chinese-internet-giant-limits-online-game-play-for-children-over-health-concerns\">swiftly introduced one-hour time limits</a> for under-12s and two hours for 12- to 18-year-olds.</p> <p>Analysts estimate that Tencent digital services are used by more than two-thirds of the Chinese population. Chinese users collectively spend 1.7bn hours a day on the company\u2019s apps.</p> <p>The business started in cramped Shenzhen offices in the late 1990s, swiftly developing a bad reputation for cloning digital products for the Chinese market, but it was the launch of WeChat in 2011 that supercharged the company\u2019s strategy.<br></p> <p>The WeChat eco-system is so broad it is almost like rolling most of the apps on a typical western user\u2019s mobile phone into one.<br></p> <p>\u201cIt is compared to What\u2019s App or Facebook messenger but it is not really,\u201d says Xiaofeng Wang, a Singapore-based analyst with Forrester. \u201cIt has payment systems, smart city offerings such as the ability to schedule appointments at a bank, a doctor, pay traffic fines or make visa applications and e-commerce.\u201d</p> <p>Tencent\u2019s ambition to be an essential part of digital daily life means it holds a dizzyingly diverse range of interests including in Didi, China\u2019s answer to Uber, the nation\u2019s second biggest e-tailer JD.com and Hike, a messaging service popular in India. In December, it even did an Amazon, which has gone real-world buying retailer Whole Foods, taking a stake in one of China\u2019s largest supermarket chains, Yonghui Superstores.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d334c615bb25cf781b050ceb7052053645e36024\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d334c615bb25cf781b050ceb7052053645e36024/318_0_1999_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tencent was a backer of the film Kong: Skull Island.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tencent was a backer of the film Kong: Skull Island.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It also has a stake in Hollywood film distributor STX Entertainment, behind movies such as Bad Moms and All The Money in the World, while movie arm Tencent Pictures was a backer of blockbuster Kong: Skull Island.</p> <p>\u201cThe ultimate goal of all their investments is to enhance the services they have already developed, to support the eco-system,\u201d says Ruomeng Wang, senior analyst at IHS Markit.</p> <p>The protected market conditions that have allowed Tencent to flourish, and the vast differences between Chinese and foreign internet users\u2019 web habits, has seen the company struggle abroad. Seven years after launching WeChat it is yet to break into any other market, although it has earmarked Malaysia.</p> <p>Analysts believe a key focus will be on targeting the huge numbers of Chinese diaspora and tourists by making WeChat features like payment available overseas, rather than try and make the app a fully-fledged Facebook rival. The payment system is already available in places like Harrods and Selfridges.</p> <p>\u201cWeChat and Tencent tried aggressively expanding into international markets like South America, Europe and even the US but it didn\u2019t work out so well in mainstream western markets where existing players like What\u2019s App are so established,\u201d says Forrester\u2019s Wang. \u201cTheir global expansion will in some places target Chinese travellers, with different strategies in emerging markets like South East Asia.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7e8312aaf912d11f52d25d8b64f1836dc1308bd4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7e8312aaf912d11f52d25d8b64f1836dc1308bd4/0_313_2153_1291/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tencent co-founder Ma Huateng aka Pony Ma.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tencent co-founder Ma Huateng aka Pony Ma.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ChinaFotoPress/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Tencent facts</h2> <ul> <li>It is ironic that a company worth over $500bn happens to be called Tencent, which translates into English as \u201csoaring information\u201d.<br></li> <li>Co-founder Ma Huateng, nickname Pony Ma, is the 14th richest person in the world with a fortune of almost $50bn, one place below Google co-founder Sergey Brin.<br></li> <li>Befitting its status as a global tech giant the company is aping its Silicon Valley rivals with a new $600m twin skyscraper headquarters.</li> <li>Tencent is one of three Chinese internet behemoths, including Baidu and Alibaba, known collectively as BAT.
