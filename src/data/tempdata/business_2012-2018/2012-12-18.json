      "bodyText": "It's shortly after 9.30am in the small town of Earby in Lancashire, tucked just south of the Yorkshire Dales national park, and Laura Craig is well into her daily round. The local postwoman strides up garden paths past inflatable Santas and tinsel wreaths to empty the first load of the day from her oversized bag. They've had all sorts of weather here: Monday was sodden, while last Friday the pavements were so icy \"people were coming off the buses and crawling to their doors\", according to one local resident. But today is a glorious, chill morning, complete with dazzling sunrise and small birds chirruping in competition with the yapping dogs that greet Craig's approach in every fourth or fifth house. It has, needless to say, been a busy day. All leave is cancelled in December in Barnoldswick delivery office, where Craig, 27, prepared her walk earlier, sorting letters, parcels and the extra crop of Christmas cards into street order and bundling them together for the six or so loops of streets that make up her daily round. Tuesday mornings are usually easy, compared with Wednesdays. But with the online shopping ordered at the weekend working its way through the system, and the extra seasonal orders, Craig and her colleagues are braced for a scramble in the final few delivery days before Christmas. It's as much a festive tradition as bread sauce and hangovers, and one being repeated in every community in the country as Royal Mail seeks to clear sorting offices of the millions of items of post that flood the network each December. But however cheery each greeting \u2013 \"Y'all right, Laura?\" shouts one elderly woman as she waits for her dog to defecate in a patch of soggy grass next to Tyseley Grove \u2013 these are uncertain times for Britain's postal service, with no one willing to predict what the future holds for the nation's much-loved red delivery vans. Though the postal service has shrugged off repeated warnings, it is unarguable that the social media generation sends fewer letters and cards than the one before. The predicted 800m cards the service will handle this year is a 20% decrease on 2005. The effect on the Christmas post of a punishing price rise earlier this year, when the cost of first-class stamps rose from 46p to 60p and second class from 36p to 50p, has yet to be measured, but a survey for Saga found that more than half of the over-50s planned to send fewer cards. And yet, says Darren Banks, the collection and delivery sector manager for the BB postcode area, into which Barnoldswick falls: \"I have been 27 years with Royal Mail, and every time we get a new machine or a new system we have thought it was the decline of the business, and it wasn't. More people are now sending emails and text messages, so you would think post was dead, but it's just so easy to order online, and we're here to fulfil that.\" Half the service's revenue now comes from delivering parcels, a boom sector, which along with the price rises has been thanked for profits rising from \u00a312m to \u00a3144m in the six months to September. No one is in doubt about what that is likely to mean. In April, Royal Mail formally separated from Post Office Ltd, which oversees the 12,000 post office branches across the country. While Post Office Ltd will almost certainly remain in state hands, privatisation of Royal Mail is widely held to be imminent, perhaps as early as autumn 2013, meaning this could be the last time Craig and her 159,000 colleagues deliver the Christmas post on behalf of a state-owned service. \"We don't talk about it,\" says Craig, who became a postie five years ago. \"Everybody knows it's going to happen. But I think people are just trying to concentrate on getting on with the delivery side of things.\" Will it make a difference? \"Depends who buys us.\" There may be bumpy times ahead, with Royal Mail and the Communication Workers Union (CWU), which represents postal workers, complaining to Ofcom that competition in the sector threatens the principle of a universal service. At least the customers seem happy. The Christmas tips have started. Craig will occasionally be thrust a few pounds and told to buy herself a drink, but more often it's chocolate or biscuits. \"I feel a bit uncomfortable taking it, but it's nice to be appreciated,\" she says, with a grin. She'll have walked 11 miles, up driveways and down cul de sacs, before she's done. \u2022 This article was amended on 19 December 2012 to correct the cost of first-class stamps before this year's price rise. It was further amended on 21 December 2012 to correct an editing error that led to it saying \"While Royal Mail will almost certainly remain in state hands, privatisation is widely held to be imminent\".",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain's cash-strapped households have remained under pressure in the run-up to Christmas, as rising food prices held inflation at 2.7% in November. Despite hopes that the squeeze on consumers' finances would start to ease, the Office for National Statistics said the annual inflation rate was unchanged in November, at 2.7%, as measured on the consumer price index. The ONS said the impact of cheaper petrol on consumers' pockets was offset by higher household energy bills and the rising price of bread, cereals and vegetables. Drought conditions in the US grain belt in the summer led to lower yields than usual, pushing up prices, while at home the wet conditions in spring and summer damaged vegetable crops \u2013 particularly potatoes, according to the statisticians. Recent reports have suggested the cost of sprouts has rocketed by nearly 25% over the past year. The ONS also recorded a rise in the price of sweets and chocolate bars. It said: \"A number of confectionery products have reduced in size. This is treated as a price increase in the CPI and RPI as consumers get less for their money.\" Overall food prices rose by 1.1% between October and November. Living standards have fallen consistently over the past 12 months, as inflation has run well above pay increases. The latest labour market data showed average wages rising at just 1.8% a year. Measured on the retail prices index (RPI), which includes mortgage interest payments, the inflation rate was 3% in November, down from 3.2% in October. The cost of some mortgage deals has declined as the Bank of England's Funding for Lending scheme has offered cheap money to banks willing to pass on the benefits to borrowers. With households struggling to make ends meet, the cost of living has become a growing political issue. Cathy Jamieson, of Labour's shadow Treasury team, said: \"In the New Year millions of families and pensioners face rising energy bills, the granny tax, and cuts to working tax credit and child benefit, while 8,000 millionaires get a tax cut.\" But a Treasury spokeswoman insisted: \"At the autumn statement, the government took more action to help households with the cost of living including a further increase in the tax-free personal allowance and cancelling the fuel duty increase that was planned for January.\" George Osborne caved in to intense lobbying to cancel the planned January fuel duty rise; but the ONS pointed out that petrol prices actually fell in November by 3p a litre, to \u00a31.35. The failure of inflation to drop back in November will add to the concerns of those members of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee who fear that inflation has become \"sticky\", and could take off if quantitative easing is not reversed. The Bank's QE programme has pumped \u00a3375bn into the economy since 2009. Andrew Sentance, senior economic adviser to PriceWaterhouseCoopers and a former member of the Bank's rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee, said: \"Persistent above-target inflation creates a headwind for consumers, squeezing their spending, and is likely to dampen the recovery in economic growth which we are expecting to see next year.\" Sentance argued for rates to rise once the immediate crisis of 2008-2009 was over. The Office for Budget Responsibility, which has repeatedly been forced to downgrade its growth forecasts as a sustainable recovery has failed to materialise, cited higher-than-expected inflation as one reason for the economy's weak performance. Howard Archer of researchers IHS Global Insight said that with further utility price rises in December and January, it is \"very possible that increased energy tariffs and higher food prices could push consumer price inflation up to 3% early in 2013 and keep it there for a while\". Simon Hayes, of Barclays, predicted that \"households will have to endure above-target inflation throughout 2013\".",

Opening hours at the 49 remaining stores, according to their customer service hotline, are from 9am until they sell out. At the Tottenham Hale branch in north London it's barely 11am but the pickings are already looking slim. Shop assistants stand around looking bewildered. \"Twenty-five minutes left,\" one staff member shouts. \"Ninety per cent off everything!\" Just behind the automatic doors are three tables, where an assortment of vacuum cleaner filters, belts and bags are scattered. There is also one vacuum cleaner, though it looks broken. Further back, a box of plugs. Only the reception of the huge warehouse store is open. In the background, just rows of empty shelves. Disappointed customers mill in and out, mostly empty handed. \"There's nothing left on offer,\" says Emile Martin, 48, who works for an undertakers. \"I'm just working at a funeral, but I had an hour off so I thought I'd take a look. It's more depressing than the funeral.\" Ali Smith, 25, who works at nearby Currys, was hoping to get a computer. \"It seems like I was beaten to it,\" he sighs. \"I just feel sorry for the staff and management. It's really bad.\" One customer has come to collect a set of fridge filters she had bought in advance. \"No chance of getting them now,\" she says. \"I've just been given a piece of paper and told to go to head office. But it can't be good for these guys just before Christmas.\" Another is loading up her car with an oven fume extractor and a waffle iron.

Saeid Saeidi, 48, however, an electrical contractor, leaves in high spirits. He is holding a bag containing all of the aforementioned plug sockets. \"Five pounds for 20!\" he says, \"I didn't even get a receipt! I was hoping to buy many things which were cheap. Computer, TV, camera, whatever. Unfortunately it's all been wiped out very early \u2026 You want any plugs?\" Among the staff, the emotions appear mixed. Some are joking around, enjoying the attention of the occasion. Most look ashen faced. One security guard, taking a cigarette break, outside says he has been working there for three years. He has had no luck finding alternative employment so far. \"It's the first time we've had Christmas without a job,\" he says. \"I don't know how we'll celebrate. There was a friendly staff community, I'll be sad to be leaving.\" Sherene Chalhie, 24, one of the 7,000 employees made redundant by the collapse, has worked at the store for almost five years. It has supported her through her studies and while she seeks work as an actor. Fortunately she has found another job in retail, although the older staff members are finding it harder, she says. \"It fees like a family falling apart. People have been crying in here already.\" Just after midday, the shutters close. People continue to peer in. One woman even rings the doorbell. \"Can I come in?\" asks a middle-aged man. \"Not unless you're a member of staff,\" replies the flustered manager and he slides the doors together.

Once the administration is completed, Deloitte will issue a full report to creditors which will be publicly available, as is the initial report published on Monday. OpCapita has no further comment to make at this stage.\" Hopes of finding a buyer for Comet were not high. Deloitte said 118 parties expressed an interest in buying parts or all of the chain but none of the four offers that subsequently emerged was viable. It is still speaking to a \"small number of parties\" but talks are thought to centre on the sale of the brand name, with online retailer Appliances Direct the frontrunner.",

On earnings, he said:</p> <blockquote> Consensus forecasts for Vodafone are now falling to more conservative levels in our view, with consensus earnings per share estimates for the year to March 2014 now at 15.8p, having been 17.4p in June and now close to our forecast (15.2p). <br> We expect Vodafone organic growth to worsen for the next two quarters but then potentially inflect (get less negative) from the first quarter of 2014 on lower regulatory and economic headwinds, less impact from SMS cannibalisation, and a slowdown in pricing pressure.

However, Vodafone has said that it reviews the US investment twice a year at the board level, and we believe there is more room for debate on the outlook for the US market. There could be reasons to believe that we are seeing peak performance at Verizon Wireless.  While a tougher environment could take time to show through, and could hit other players such as AT&amp;T first, the risk remains that the stock market will move faster than the facts on the ground, undercutting Vodafone's ability to extract a high price for its 45% stake, or investors' ability to sell such a stake if spun out into a separate company. </blockquote> <p>Vodafone shares closed 1.95p lower at 156.25p, the biggest faller in the leading index.</p> <p>Overall, with a quiet day in the eurozone, investors focused on the prospects for a resolution to the US budget impasse before the country fall over the fiscal cliff, the combination of tax rises and spending cuts due to come into force in 2013.

But pesaola, ballymichael and Chewtoy all supplied plenty of correct answers, as did HoneyBadger90 (including 10/10 for Round 4!), while ShiresofEngland was better than he gave himself credit for, and siren45 was disadvantaged by a refusal to name Christine Lagarde. And we shouldn't forget that Hill777 was the popular class rebel (although as you stretched the boundaries of truth and called me \"clever\" you can get away with anything). So, hope it was fun, and a nice way of remembering the year. This isn't the end of the liveblog for 2012 - I'll be back tomorrow as usual.

The Lagarde List of alleged Greek tax evaders 4) Which country is implementing a \u20ac65bn austerity package? Spain 5) How did 21 people cause a shock in May (although they were reduced to 18 in June)? They were elected as Golden Dawn MPs in the Greek elections 6) How many LTROs has the ECB conducted?

Nine 8) And how many eurozone countries hold a AAA rating with S&amp;P, Fitch and Moody's?

You can score for Bank of Greece, the European Central Bank or Goldman Sachs (what a busy life!) 10) And what term is Citi's Willem H Buiter credited with dreaming up?

Latvia's finance minister has declared today that it will submit its application to join the single currency in February. Despite some public opposition to the move, Andris Vilks told Reuters today that the time was right for Latvia to embrace the euro. Vilks said: We can look at the past three years. Latvia was predictable. If we look now, we have the fastest economic growth, but at the same time, the price growth is very restrained With that, we shouldn't have any negative surprises here. I think we've earned respect. And as this photo shows, Latvia has the paperwork to prove it: Here's a few more posers for you, from you: 1) On which Greek island in April 2010 did George Papandreou announce Greece's application for a bailout? (thanks YannisKoutsomitis !) 2) I mentioned earlier that Cyprus held the EU presidency this year, but which country had the honour for the first half of 2012? (thanks Lorkan!) 3) Who spoke Dutch, not the language they are associated with, to baffle a spy (thanks ShiresofEngland !) 4) What was the full name of the initiative which wasn't, as we briefly thought, known as the MOT? 5) How much is Ireland paying in interest and repayment per year (the next payment on 31.03.2013) for its promissory notes to repay the cost of bailing out Anglo-Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society? (thanks ballymichael !) Hats off to Chewtoy for writing an entire quiz round, dubbed the Revolving Door quiz: 1) Of which bank was the future Governor of the Bank of England managing director? 2) For which bank was the unelected PM of Italy an international adviser in the years directly between his current position and that of former European Commissioner for Competition (1999 - 2004)? 3) Of which bank was the current head of the European Central Bank (ECB) a vice-chairman for Europe (2002 - 2005)? 4) Of which bank was a German former board member of the ECB and Bundesbank an adviser. (Hint: he helped create the Euro.) 5) Which bank did the current head of Greece's debt management agency used to work for? 6) With which bank did the unelected PM of Greece (2011 - 2012) and former Vice President of the ECB (2002 - 2010) make dodgy swap deals to mask the extent of Greece's debt when he was head of the Central Bank of Greece (1994 - 2002), causing Greece's current sovereign debt crisis? 7) Which bank did the 2011 head of the IMF's European Department used to work for? 8) For which bank is the former European Commissioner for Competition (1985 - 1989) and former Attorney General of Ireland now a non-executive director? 9) For which bank is the European Commissioner for Competition (1993 - 1999) now an international adviser? And question 10: Whose lights stayed on during Hurricane Sandy?... European stock markets are up (or flat) today, amid optimism that America is going to reach a deal over the fiscal cliff (rather than going over the fiscal cliff). FTSE 100: up 20 points at 5933, +0.36% German DAX: up 31 points at 7636, +0.4% French CAC: up 1 point at 3639 Spanish IBEX: up 73 points at 8114, +0.9% FTSE MIB: up 67 points at 10972, +0.45% The minirally was sparked by President Obama presenting a new proposal to end the deadlock in Washington. As Wall Street correspondent Dominic Rushe wrote overnight: Barack Obama has moved to head off the fiscal cliff budget crisis, tabling an offer to Republicans that involves raising taxes on those earning over $400,000, almost doubling his previous threshold of $250,000. The outlines of a possible deal, after weeks of stalemate, took shape on a day of compromise in Washington as Obama met the Republican House Speaker, John Boehner, at the White House. Dom's full story is here. Senior US politicans have indicated today that the two sides are getting closer... While we were quizzing, Cyprus was denying that it had run out of money to pay public sector salaries. The country's finance ministry told reporters in Nicosia that the government had secured enough money to cover its immediate financial needs, and that workers salaries would be paid this month. It was spurred into action after the permanent secretary of the finance ministry, Christos Patsalides, told parliament that there might be no money for Christmas salaries unless Cyprus's three biggest state-owned companies agreed to dip into their pension funds and lend it \u20ac250m. According to AP, all three have indicated that they would do so, buying Cyprus some time while it negotiates an IMF-led bailout. Just received an absence note... That's your lot for the moment (a eurocrisis picture round is proving tricky). If you've got a better question, email me (with the answer please!), and I'll post a readers' round before the end of the day, to graeme.wearden@guardian.co.uk Otherwise.... back to the day job.... 1) Where has former Greek PM George Papandreou been lecturing? 2) Which capital city did hundreds of striking miners march to this summer? 3) Mario Draghi delivered his \"the euro is irreversible\" speech in which city in July? 4) In which city were thousands of police mobilised when the ECB governing council visited for its monthly meeting? 5) In what location did Golden Dawn MP Ilias Kasidiaris attack two leftwing MPs? 6) Which was the first Spanish region to formally request a bailout? 7) Which country is taking the EU presidency from Cyprus? 8) And which non-eurozone country did Cyprus discuss taking a multibillion-euro loan from? 9) Which EU member country said in September that it was freezing plans to join the euro, saying it saw \"only costs\"? 10) Where was newly inaugurated French president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande flying to when he had a very nasty shock.....? 1) Who told the Guardian that Greeks should help \"by all paying their taxes\"? 2) And whose heart \"bleeds\" for Greece? 3) Who pledged to do whatever it takes \"within our mandate\"? 4) Who leads the Coalition of the Radical Left - Unitary Social Front? 5) Who is kissing goodbye to the presidency (after plenty of hugging and kissing during it)? 6) Who appeared to win victory at a summit in June, just after his country also managed a sporting triumph over the same 'opposition'? 7) What role did Poul Thomsen play in Athens this year? 8) Which British businessman sponsored a \u00a3250,000 prize for the best way for a country to leave the euro? 9) Which bank did Lucas Papademos, Greece's former technocratic PM, once work for? (we're thinking investment bank here, but other correct answers exist, eh Pesaola?) 10) And what term is Citi's Willem H Buiter credited with dreaming up? (sorry for the delay - Jumpedfromthepier pre-empted my Gerard Depardieu question in the comments) Meanwhile, in the UK economy... inflation has remained stubbornly high, with the consumer prices index sticking at 2.7%. Economists had expected a fall. Full details here. Regular reader kizbot has posted her own quiz question below the line: 1. Who is the European economist that predicted the crisis back in the 1850s? And here's the answer (full, er, marks if you answered correctly) Here goes.... 1) What started off at \u20ac11bn, but grew to \u20ac13.5bn before it was agreed? 2) Which trip lasted just 6 hours? 3) What contains around 2,000 entries? 4) Which country is implementing a \u20ac65bn austerity package? 5) How did 21 people cause a shock in May (although they were reduced to 18 in June)? 6) How many LTROs has the ECB conducted? 7) How many countries were downgraded by S&amp;P one night in January? 8) And how many Eurozone countries hold a AAA rating with S&amp;P, Fitch and Moody's? 9) Which country currently has the lowest unemployment rate within the eurozone*? 10) And how many countries have a youth unemployment rate over 50%*? * - according to eurostat's latest data While you chew your pencils (or lean back and look around the room if you're ballymichael), I can flag up that: 1) Sweden's central bank has cut its interest rates by a quarter-point, to 1%. More here 2) Spanish bad bank loans have hit a new record high of 11.23% in October, from 10.7% in September. 1) Often wears a bow tie? 2) Once fined Microsoft? 3) Has Neil Kinnock for a father-in-law? 4) Went to Harvard, and shared a college room with a his predecessor? (tweaked following an interjection from the floor) 5) Has a political journalist for a partner? 6) Is married to a quantum chemist? 7) Grew up in Angola? 8) Is a communist? 9) Is married to a football player? 10) Survived a walk on the Wilders side? (the examiners are a kind bunch, and will accept the leaders' country if you can't quite remember their name...) An early bid for answer of the day, from ShiresofEngland: &gt; 9am GMT: Name the European Leader Easy, it's Angela Merkel Good morning all. We're going to do things a little differently today. As it's quiet, and nearly Christmas, we're going to roll out the eurozone quiz. A few brainteasers to keep you entertained (hopefully), and show how much you've been paying attention. No prizes I'm afraid, in this time of austerity, just the glory and satisfaction of proving your knowledge, or arguing over a contentious question. Here's the schedule: 9am GMT: Name the European leader 10am GMT: Numbers 11am GMT: People Noon GMT: Places Might throw in a few picture questions in the afternoon too. Please post your answers for each round as soon as you're happy, and we'll do the adding up at the end. In between rounds I'll cover any breaking news and key developments within the blog, but to be honest there's not much afoot.... Any problems?
