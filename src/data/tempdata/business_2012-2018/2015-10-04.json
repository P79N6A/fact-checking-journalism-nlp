      "bodyText": "Last week came the news that the Australian stock exchange had one of its biggest one-day losses in the past decade. And then, over the next two days, it made back all those losses. Such is often the case with stock markets. But the Australian stock market has, since the global financial crisis (GFC), mostly been bound in shallows and miseries. For those of us with superannuation accounts, the days of regular, strong annual growth are now almost a decade in the past. Reporting stock exchange falls or surges is always fraught with danger. Falls during the morning can turn around and see trading end with the exchange pretty much square. On Friday, for example, after opening at 10am the ASX 200 fell 1.3% in the first half an hour, but by 10.45am was up 0.1%, and then by 2.30pm was back down 1%. Even big daily falls that seem like the end of times can be recovered within a day or two, as occurred last week \u2013 and indeed has happened over the past month: Over the past 15 years, the All Ordinaries Index has moved on average 0.7% each day \u2013 either up or down. The past month has seen the market become rather more volatile, with an average daily move of 1.3%. While that can be interesting news for day traders, it can mean little for the rest of us. For all the news about big daily swings and roundabouts, the real news of the Australian stock exchange is how poor it has been performing for nearly a decade. All of us with a superannuation account have no doubt heard about the need to take the long-term view with shares. Getting caught up in the day-to-day movement can miss the overall picture. But determining what is the long term is tricky. You won\u2019t want to use 12 months if you are encouraging people to invest \u2013 for there we see a fairly volatile picture as well: In March this year it looked like there was a chance the All Ordinaries and ASX 200 might break through the 6,000 mark. And yet both are now hovering around 5,000. There is nothing overly important about the 6,000 barrier, other than it is a nice round number, but had it been reached it would have been the first time for seven years that the stock market had been above that level. And this is the bigger problem with Australia\u2019s market \u2013 right now it is at the same level it was roughly nine years ago: That doesn\u2019t mean no one has made any profit on the stock market over the past nine years, but for long-term investors it does not tell a particularly happy tale. And, as holders of superannuation accounts, most of us are long-term investors now. From 1997-98 to 2006-07, superannuation funds averaged an annual rate of return of 7.3%; from 2007-08 to 2012-13 the average was just 1.3%: And the reality is that superannuation returns are strongly linked with the performance of the stock market: That\u2019s a worry for those in their mid to late 20s, whose superannuation has only just started; it\u2019s also a worry for those near retirement, who 5 to 10 years ago would have expected to have more in their pot than they will now. The Australian stock market has never fully recovered from the GFC. It didn\u2019t involve the biggest post-1945 crash, but it has been among the longest running. In October 2007, the All Ordinaries index reached 6,779; it is now 96 months since that peak, and we are nowhere near reaching it. By comparison, the stock market after the crash of 1987 \u2013 which saw the market plunge 24.9% in one day \u2013 returned to its pre-crash peak 76 months later (although it did then falter, and it was not until 100 months after October 1987 that the market stayed above the pre-crash peak). The weak stock-market performance reflects that a big issue for Australia is not just weak economic growth, but negligible income growth: The fall in our terms of trade (the price of our exports over our imports) is the biggest for 150 years. As the IMF noted in its recent evaluation of our economy, the past two decades of \u201cexceptionally strong income growth\u201d has been brought to a halt by \u201cthe waning resource investment boom and sharp fall in the terms of trade\u201d. The IMF suggests that \u201ca cyclical recovery is likely in the near term, but over the medium term, income growth is likely to slow to a rate in line with other advanced economies\u201d. It is worth remembering that the boom in the stock market from 2003 to 2007 was highly unusual. Over the past 30 years the Australian stock market has grown on average by 8.1% every 12 months. From 2004 to the end of 2007 it was growing at an average rate of 19.6%. And this is where the long-term view comes in handy. Given most people will work for over 30 years, looking at the performance of the stock market since 1984 gives us a nice long-term view. And what is striking is that, had the trend growth from 1984 to 2002 continued, the value of the stock exchange would be approximately where we find it today: Thus, the long term is the way to look at the market. And with the economy growing weakly, national income barely at all, and another year with no improvement in the share market, thinking long term is definitely best when contemplating your superannuation returns.",

      "bodyText": "China\u2019s downturn, the prospect of rising interest rates and uncertainty about the global economic outlook have knocked confidence among bosses of the UK\u2019s biggest companies, according to a survey. Chief financial officers (CFOs) polled by the consultancy Deloitte reported a sharp rise in uncertainty facing their businesses and have scaled back their expectations for investment and hiring over the coming year. Almost three-quarters of the 122 CFOs, or 73%, said the level of financial and economic uncertainty was either above normal, high or very high. That was up from 55% in the second quarter of this year and is the highest proportion for more than two years. Uncertainty rises China\u2019s economic slowdown, which has coincided with a dramatic stock market rout in the country and sent shockwaves across global financial markets, appeared to play a strong part in falling risk appetite among UK companies. In the survey, 60% of CFOs said the Chinese downturn would have a negative effect on their business in the next 12 months. Ian Stewart, the chief economist at Deloitte, said: \u201cEmerging market weakness and equity market turmoil have taken a toll on risk appetite among the UK\u2019s largest businesses. \u201cBut sentiment among large businesses is changeable and heavily influenced by the global environment, especially by news flow and the performance of equity markets. In both areas, good news has been in short supply of late: UK equities down 16% from their April peaks; US institutional investor optimism at 2009 levels; financial market volatility up sharply and more downgrades to emerging market growth forecasts.\u201d Asked to rate the factors that pose threats to their business, CFOs attached the greatest importance to the prospect of higher interest rates, weakness in emerging markets and geopolitical risks, and deflation and economic weakness in the eurozone. But they appeared less concerned about domestic demand and political risks, with worries receding over the UK\u2019s referendum on EU membership and the country\u2019s poor productivity record. Ahead of a spending review by the chancellor, George Osborne, at the end of November, worries about UK spending cuts edged up. Stewart said: \u201cThe firms on the CFO survey panel are large and have heavy overseas exposure, with more than half their revenues coming from outside the UK. While external risks are centre stage, CFOs are positive on prospects for the UK economy.\u201d With inflation at zero and signs of softness in the UK and global economy, the Bank of England is expected to hold interest rates at 0.5% when it announces its latest policy decision this week. Policymakers slashed rates during the downturn and they have been at a record low for more than six years. In the US, the Federal Reserve also opted to keep interest rates at a record low at its last meeting, despite speculation that policy could be tightened. Stewart said: \u201cFalling corporate risk appetite and sentiment suggests that the Federal Reserve and Bank of England have been absolutely right to maintain interest rates at ultra-low levels. But despite the more emollient tone from central banks, CFOs still see tighter monetary policy as the number one threat to their businesses.\u201d A separate survey of entrepreneurs and small business owners painted a rosier picture after a strong year, and reported that the majority are planning for \u201ceven brighter times ahead\u201d. A report by EY said many were anticipating substantial increases in profits and employment growth. Profits increase for 76% of respondents and 39% created more than 20 new jobs. Over the next three years, 90% of the UK\u2019s entrepreneurs expect their profits to grow, with 53% forecasting that growth will top 10%. Entrepreneurs in the technology sector (59%) and those with businesses in the south-east and south-west (67%) are among the most optimistic. Stuart Watson, a spokesman for EY, said: \u201cEntrepreneurs have survived a turbulent 12 months, proving the resilience of the UK\u2019s medium-sized firms. Uncertainty over the general election result and an ongoing crisis in the eurozone could have hampered their businesses\u2019 growth. \u201cHowever, responding entrepreneurs have not only laid solid foundations to support sustainable growth in the future, but are firmly planning to lead the way when it comes to increasing turnover and creating jobs.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "AstraZeneca, one of Britain\u2019s largest businesses, is using a multimillion-pound tax avoidance scheme in the Netherlands, set up months after the UK relaxed its tax laws for multinationals in 2013. A Guardian investigation has found the pharmaceutical giant created the scheme using $2.7bn (\u00a31.8bn) of internal group loans routed through its Dutch subsidiaries. The company paid no corporation tax in the UK, despite having made global profits in 2013 and 2014 totalling $4.5bn. It was legally able to do so partly by securing some UK tax deductions from the Dutch lending structure as well as by offsetting high running costs and investment at its UK operations and using other tax breaks, some relating to new medicine research and development. Tax experts asked by the Guardian to review its findings said AstraZeneca\u2019s scheme appeared to be constructed solely as a way to avoid tax, and that the company could benefit from this in the future. But AstraZeneca said it has not made savings from the scheme and was winding up the Dutch structure ahead of an anticipated tightening of international tax rules by the OECD. Stephen Shay, a senior law lecturer at Harvard Law School who has held senior tax roles in the US Treasury and who gave expert testimony in 2013 on Apple\u2019s tax avoidance structures in a Senate investigation, said that it was \u201chard to say\u201d how the companies in the Dutch structure \u201chave a real commercial purpose other than to achieve the tax outcome\u201d. Each year in its annual report, AstraZeneca says: \u201cWe draw a distinction between tax planning using artificial structures and optimising tax treatment of business transactions and we engage only in the latter.\u201d AstraZeneca told the Guardian the promise stood. It conceded its Dutch arrangements involved some tax planning but said the main purpose was providing financing for overseas acquisitions. Any related tax matters had all been approved by HMRC and the Dutch tax office, it added. Explaining its decision to pour $2.7bn of loans through a Dutch structure, it said: \u201cAstraZeneca acted on the UK legislation introduced ... to give companies greater freedom in managing overseas financing operations... \u201cThe use of this UK government-sponsored regime for tax planning purposes did not produce any tax savings for AstraZeneca. In 2013 and 2014, the AstraZeneca UK group of companies was not profitable due to patent expirations and continued investment in the research and development of new medicines.\u201d Independent experts said it was hard to reach a final assessment of the value of tax advantages from the Dutch avoidance structure because this depended on AstraZeneca\u2019s future ability to make use of certain tax credits it now held. \u201cIt\u2019s not as though [AstraZeneca] is not going to get a benefit,\u201d said Shay. \u201cIt\u2019s only a question of the value of the benefit on a present-value basis. You can\u2019t say Astra doesn\u2019t have a benefit.\u201d AstraZeneca\u2019s Dutch structure was set up less than five months after new rules came into effect reining in HMRC powers to combat tax avoidance by international businesses. Richard Brooks, a former HMRC tax inspector, now a journalist at Private Eye and author of The Great Tax Robbery, said: \u201cIt\u2019s clear from the AstraZeneca companies\u2019 accounts and replies to [the Guardian] that this scheme was designed to generate a UK tax advantage.\u201d Richard Murphy, accountant, tax campaigner and the author of The Joy of Tax, said: \u201cThe structure only appears to exist for tax purposes, to try to secure a tax advantage.\u201d AstraZeneca\u2019s top tax accountant, Ian Brimicombe, sat for several years on a Treasury committee advising the government on the changes in the law. Without one alteration, which came into force almost three years ago, the group\u2019s avoidance structure would not have worked. Osborne is expected to use a speech to the Conservative party conference in Manchester on Monday morning to highlight how the UK economy is reaping benefits from the highly competitive tax regime he created. Hours later, in Paris, much-anticipated international tax reform proposals by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) targeting tax avoidance by multinationals will be published. Senior OECD officials have warned current rules are so abused \u2013 both by multinationals and by countries competing for investment \u2013 that they are close to breaking point. But British diplomats, while supportive of many OECD reforms, have battled behind the scenes to to protect prized tax policies that helped make Britain a favourable environment for the location of international business. Pascal Soriot, AstraZeneca\u2019s chief executive, was among more than 100 business leaders who signed an open letter in support of Conservative party tax policies during the general election campaign earlier this year. Soriot later said he had not intended to endorse a political party but confirmed: \u201cI support policies that reinforce a competitive tax environment and encourage investment in the UK.\u201d How the tax scheme works In April 2013 AstraZeneca set up its unusual Dutch lending operation \u2013 an arrangement described as \u201chighly artificial tax avoidance\u201d by independent tax experts. The loan structure, which is within the law, centred around a type of Dutch co-operative, an unusual corporate entity first allowed in the mid-19th century to assist dairy farmers. AstraZeneca\u2019s co-operative is incorporated at the group\u2019s Dutch offices, eight miles east of The Hague. Accounts for AstraZeneca Finance Co\u00f6peratief WA do not show signs of significant business activity: there are no staff on the payroll and it has modest operating costs. Nevertheless the co-operative was packed with loans of $2.7bn from head office in the UK, and is charged interest of more than $140m a year. Interest flows exploited differences between the way tax codes in the UK and the Netherlands apply to Dutch co-operatives. The result was that the two tax offices treated the interest as occurring on their own patch, both awarding huge tax breaks for the same payment. In tax avoidance jargon, claiming a tax deduction twice on the same payment is called \u201cdouble dipping\u201d. Brooks said: \u201cGenerating a double tax deduction for a single expense by using a strange Dutch entity that one tax authority sees one way, and another as something completely different, looks like highly artificial tax avoidance.\u201d Under previous versions of HMRC\u2019s anti-avoidance laws \u2013 known as the controlled foreign companies (CFC) regime \u2013 the tax benefit of a double dip could be pounced on by HMRC and neutralised. Since tax office powers were reduced, however, only about a quarter of the tax advantage can be clawed back. This article was amended on 5 October 2015 to clarify that AstraZeneca Finance Co\u00f6peratief WA is charged interest of more than $140m a year.",

      "bodyText": "HMV will continue its remarkable turnaround in the run-up to Christmas, embarking on an international expansion drive just two years after falling into administration. The UK music retailer has opened 14 new stores this year, with another three planned before Christmas. This is in stark contrast to early 2013 when the business collapsed under \u00a3176m of debt and 80 of its 223 shops were shut. It was rescued by the retail turnaround firm Hilco, which took on 141 high street stores and 2,600 employees. HMV has made a rapid comeback on the high street, wresting the title of the UK\u2019s biggest music and DVD retailer back from Amazon in January. In the fortnight leading up to Christmas, HMV sold one-in-three of all CDs and DVDs in the UK. Hilco moved quickly to reopen the legendary HMV store at 363 Oxford Street in London, where the chain had its first store in 1921 \u2013 complete with retro neon sign. In June, HMV relaunched its e-commerce site for the first time since it went into administration, offering music downloads. Getting more bands to perform live in its stores has been key to its turnaround, with acts ranging from Ed Sheran to Megadeth coming to its shops to promote their latest albums. HMV has hosted more than 1,000 live events. Hilco also shut loss-making stores, taking the number of UK stores to 125, and stopped selling iPads and tablets, preferring to stick to traditional band merchandise such as T-shirts. Speaking to the Daily Telegraph, Paul McGowan, Hilco\u2019s founder and HMV chairman, said HMV was considering taking its website into 10 other, mainly European countries. He highlighted interest from Korea, which he said was sparked by HMV\u2019s exclusive distribution rights for Irish radio station RTE. HMV has also struck a five-year licensing agreement with Qatari businessman Wissam Al Mana to take it into the Middle East. McGowan expects the first shop to open in Dubai next summer. The expansion comes after the company shrank by half. At its peak, it had 400 stores around the world, half of which were in the UK. But Hilco\u2019s restructuring programme has paid off, with every one of its HMV\u2019s stores returning to profitability by last September. HMV has benefited from a revival in vinyl, with sales rocketing. Despite the popularity of music streaming services, the number of shops selling CDs and vinyl albums in the UK hit a record high of 10,391 last year, according to an industry report. Last week HMV re-opened its Golden Square shop in Warrington, which specialises in vinyl records.",

But Hilco\u2019s restructuring programme has paid off, with every one of its HMV\u2019s stores returning to profitability by last September.</p> <p>HMV has benefited from a revival in vinyl, with sales rocketing. Despite the popularity of music streaming services, the number of shops selling CDs and vinyl albums in the UK <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/feb/24/number-physical-music-stores-all-time-high-2014\">hit a record high </a>of 10,391 last year, according to an industry report.

      "bodyText": "Volkswagen\u2019s new boss Matthias M\u00fcller is expected to make a dash to the United States to apologise for the emissions testing scandal, which has rocked the global car industry. VW\u2019s board wants M\u00fcller, who replaced Martin Winterkorn as chief executive just over a week ago, to make the trip to show humility even before he is summoned by US authorities, German magazine Der Spiegel reported. The news of the visit, which could come as early as this week, came as Volkswagen took out full-page ads in Germany\u2019s Sunday papers to say: \u201cWe will do everything possible to win back your trust.\u201d A tiny VW logo appears at the bottom of the largely white ads. The world\u2019s largest carmaker has admitted to US regulators that it fitted up to 11m diesel vehicles worldwide with software that manipulated emissions tests, including 2.8m in Germany and 1.2m in the UK. The company faces a regulatory fine of $18bn (\u00a311.8bn) in the US, as well as a number of class-action lawsuits and criminal investigations around the world. The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, labelled the scandal a \u201cdramatic\u201d event and called on the carmaker to provide the \u201cnecessary transparency\u201d. She told Deutschlandfunk: \u201cBut I think the reputation of German industry... is not so shaken that we are no longer considered a good place to do business.\u201d However, the head of the European parliament, Martin Schulz, said the scandal was a \u201cheavy blow for the German economy as a whole\u201d. Schulz, a German Social Democrat, added: \u201c I believe that Volkswagen is a strong company that has every chance of surviving the crisis.\u201d The incoming Volkswagen chairman, Hans Dieter P\u00f6tsch, told staff in Wolfsburg that the crisis threatens the company\u2019s survival \u2013 but added that it could be overcome, according to German newspaper Welt am Sonntag. At least 10 senior managers have been suspended. Bild am Sonntag reported that several VW engineers said development chief Ulrich Hackenberg, who is among those suspended, knew about the manipulation, or even commissioned it, but that there were some contradictions in their statements. The company is racing to meet a deadline, set for this Wednesday by Germany regulators, to come up with a plan to bring diesel cars in line with emissions requirements. The majority of affected cars can be fixed by upgrading the software, but some will require changes to the engines. The US regulator, the Environmental Protection Agency, has widened its investigation to include diesel models by other carmakers, including BMW, Chrysler, General Motors, Land Rover and Mercedes-Benz.",

      "bodyText": "Students at one of Britain\u2019s top universities have written to their chancellor calling on him to shut down a BP archive based at the campus library in what amounts to an escalation of campaigns against fossil fuel companies. Warwick University students this summer successfully persuaded the academic board to halt investments in coal, gas and oil companies, and believe the BP archive should have no place either. They are also angry that students have not been allowed to properly access the archive, which is believed to contain valuable research into renewable energy that was discarded when the company switched its focus back on to oil and gas. On Monday, the students will use the official start of the winter university term to formally begin the campaign, which has set a deadline of 30 November for management to begin steps towards removing BP from campus. Campaigns calling for divestment and disengagement have spread from the US to UK universities, charities and other institutions. Leah Lapautre, a member of the group Fossil Free Warwick, said: \u201cAfter successfully winning our campaign for divestment, we\u2019re taking the fight straight to a major fossil fuel company this year. \u201cBP\u2019s presence on Warwick\u2019s campus is an insidious example of the close connection between the fossil fuel industry and our public institutions. To have the presence of BP\u2019s corporate archive on our campus is outrageous, given the desperate need we have to break the power of this industry and take action on climate change; it legitimises their behaviour and sends the message that our community is ok with what BP is doing. It\u2019s also inconsistent with Warwick\u2019s pledge to stop investing in these companies.\u201d The Warwick group, with its BP Off Campus initiative, is linking up with the national network of anti\u2010BP groups, and supported protests at the British Museum earlier this month. It has been highlighting the fact that BP was last week highlighted as top of a list of fossil fuel companies that were alleged to be obstructing action in Europe on climate change. Carl-Henric Svanberg, the chairman of BP, insisted that nothing is locked away when he was challenged about the archive at the company\u2019s annual general meeting in April. But Warwick students said they have been not been able to gain access and claim that all documents post 1976, when a multi-billion pound green research and development drive was taking place, are kept away from the public. The company said it had no comment to make about the prospect of a campaign against the Warwick archive. BP has always argued that it accepts climate change is a major threat, but believes oil and gas will continue to be needed in the world. Its chief executive, Bob Dudley, has said the United Nations global warming summit in Paris in December needed to broker agreements to encourage the growth of energy efficiency schemes as well as renewable power such as wind and the use of gas. The more positive engagement by BP and Shell compares with the more sceptical stance of US companies such as Exxon.",

      "bodyText": "With solid wooden stools dotted around the lobby, a bustling coffee bar and a receptionist who says \u201cawesome\u201d as an affirmative, the ground floor of 1 Fore Street in the City of London has all the tell-tale hallmarks of a modern tech company. The seven-storey building is not home to one firm however but to multiple businesses - from individual freelancers to groups of 50 people - which have taken desks in one of the latest and most imposing examples of the growing trend for co-working spaces. Fore Street is the largest of New York-based WeWork\u2019s five London locations with 3,000 desks. Individuals and companies can rent out desks, offices and meetings rooms for variable periods and across locations in the company\u2019s network. Buildings are carved up into sub-sections with common areas between them - along with obligatory ping pong tables - and services like printing and Wi-Fi are included in the price. This new wave of companies that manage co-working spaces is seen as bringing that most established industry, real estate, into the internet era. Workers can book desks via their smartphone and do not have to commit to lengthy leases, by the end of which their company might not exist or have expanded beyond the size rented. \u201cThey are the latest incarnation of serviced offices or office hotelling, selling fully fitted out and equipped space including receptionists, coffee and access to meeting rooms only for the duration over which they are needed. Expensive, inflexible and long leases for corporate offices are no longer essential and indeed seem increasingly questionable, particularly if the occupants in any case don\u2019t like working there,\u201d Alexi Marmot, professor of facility and environment management at University College London (UCL) said. A report on serviced offices and \u201cagile occupiers\u201d by the City of London Corporation last year said that the rapidly growing sector had some 18,000 workers operating out of the common spaces, although this has since grown as companies such as WeWork take on more leases. Although the concept of a flexible office stretches back 35 years in the US, technology has given it fresh breath recently. As companies can store data in the cloud, the same infrastructure is not needed for an office space while the rise in start-up culture means young companies want to work in areas with their peers but without the long-term commitments of lengthy leases. LiquidSpace operates a booking service - or \u201cstands in the middle\u201d - between individuals and companies looking for space and those who want to rent it across the US, Canada and Australia for periods from an hour to a year. Mark Gilbreath, the firm\u2019s founder and chief executive, said: \u201cIn the traditional real estate world I am starting out on a four to six month crusade with a broker in hand, if I can get one\u2019s attention, and I am ultimately going to run into a long term lease for a fixed amount of space on inflexible terms. We have just stepped into that domain.\u201d The recent burst in activity in the area comes at a time when the millennial generation are entering the workforce, said Kia Rahmani, CEO of ShareDesk, which also provides a platform to link workers such as freelances and business travellers with serviced office space and companies which may have spare desks or meeting rooms. \u201cThey are nomadic by nature. They enjoy moving from place to place. they are accustomed to mobile technologies and having laptops and smartphones and this is really pacing the way for this new model of work in the corporate environment,\u201d he said. This expansion into the sharing economy of office space has created at least one giant in WeWork which at five years old is now valued at $10bn (\u00a36.6bn) following a round of financing in June. With five locations in London, the company places heavy emphasis on the community it attempts to create in between the offices and desks which take up the various sized slices of each building it takes leases on, usually for between 15 and 20 years. In London, it has 5,000 desks across five locations and operates at full capacity on its early buildings, said Eugen Miropolski, regional director for Europe. \u201cThis is what these young entrepreneurs and start-ups are looking for, a lot of flexibility because these companies grow very fast. And you don\u2019t want to overpay because if you go into a traditional office space with four people but you know you will be growing to 20 people, you know you will probably need an office space for 20 people and pay the whole [amount],\u201d he said. Beyond the needs of freelancers and start-ups, the concept of flexible space has become firmly entrenched in the corporate world, both for the short-term - when sales reps need meeting spaces for presentations and for longer projects. Richard Morris, the boss of office rental stalwart Regus, said when Royal Dutch Shell was pursuing the acquisition of BG Group they needed somewhere private and so set up in short-term offices in The Hague and in London. Regus itself has doubled in size in the last five years, said Morris, describing the influence of the mobile working trend as a \u201ckey enabler\u201d. He said: \u201cHow do you attract talented people? You create working practices and working environments for those people that enable them to have work life balances, to improve employee engagement and that is another thing we can see driving the demand for flexible workspace.\u201d Rahmani puts the average cost of a desk in London at \u00a3256 a month while WeWork\u2019s Fore Street office\u2019s dedicated desks start at \u00a3425 a month, a figure which changes depending on the location of the office (there is another pricing structure for hot desks). \u201cThe model makes sense on both sides. We have seen that co-working spaces that are doing well are making more money per square foot than they would otherwise renting out the whole unit to one tenant and so it is a win win model,\u201d he said.

      "body": "<p>With solid wooden stools dotted around the lobby, a bustling coffee bar and a receptionist who says \u201cawesome\u201d as an affirmative, the ground floor of 1 Fore Street in the City of London has all the tell-tale hallmarks of a modern tech company. </p> <p>The seven-storey building is not home to one firm however but to multiple businesses - from individual freelancers to groups of 50 people - which have taken desks in one of the latest and most imposing examples of the growing trend for co-working spaces. </p> <p>Fore Street is the largest of New York-based WeWork\u2019s five London locations with 3,000 desks. Individuals and companies can rent out desks, offices and meetings rooms for variable periods and across locations in the company\u2019s network. Buildings are carved up into sub-sections with common areas between them - along with obligatory ping pong tables - and services like printing and Wi-Fi are included in the price. </p> <p>This new wave of companies that manage co-working spaces is seen as bringing that most established industry, real estate, into the internet era. Workers can book desks via their smartphone and do not have to commit to lengthy leases, by the end of which their company might not exist or have expanded beyond the size rented. </p> <p>\u201cThey are the latest incarnation of serviced offices or office hotelling, selling fully fitted out and equipped space including receptionists, coffee and access to meeting rooms only for the duration over which they are needed. Expensive, inflexible and long leases for corporate offices are no longer essential and indeed seem increasingly questionable, particularly if the occupants in any case don\u2019t like working there,\u201d Alexi Marmot, professor of facility and environment management at University College London (UCL) said. </p> <p>A report on serviced offices and \u201cagile occupiers\u201d by the City of London Corporation last year said that the rapidly growing sector had some 18,000 workers operating out of the common spaces, although this has since grown as companies such as WeWork take on more leases. Although the concept of a flexible office stretches back 35 years in the US, technology has given it fresh breath recently. As companies can store data in the cloud, the same infrastructure is not needed for an office space while the rise in start-up culture means young companies want to work in areas with their peers but without the long-term commitments of lengthy leases. </p> <p>LiquidSpace operates a booking service - or \u201cstands in the middle\u201d - between individuals and companies looking for space and those who want to rent it across the US, Canada and Australia for periods from an hour to a year. </p> <p>Mark Gilbreath, the firm\u2019s founder and chief executive, said: \u201cIn the traditional real estate world I am starting out on a four to six month crusade with a broker in hand, if I can get one\u2019s attention, and I am ultimately going to run into a long term lease for a fixed amount of space on inflexible terms. We have just stepped into that domain.\u201d </p> <p>The recent burst in activity in the area comes at a time when the millennial generation are entering the workforce, said Kia Rahmani, CEO of ShareDesk, which also provides a platform to link workers such as freelances and business travellers with serviced office space and companies which may have spare desks or meeting rooms. </p> <p>\u201cThey are nomadic by nature. They enjoy moving from place to place. they are accustomed to mobile technologies and having laptops and smartphones and this is really pacing the way for this new model of work in the corporate environment,\u201d he said. </p> <p>This expansion into the sharing economy of office space has created at least one giant in WeWork which at five years old is now valued at $10bn (\u00a36.6bn) following a round of financing in June. With five locations in London, the company places heavy emphasis on the community it attempts to create in between the offices and desks which take up the various sized slices of each building it takes leases on, usually for between 15 and 20 years. </p> <p>In London, it has 5,000 desks across five locations and operates at full capacity on its early buildings, said Eugen Miropolski, regional director for Europe.</p> <p>\u201cThis is what these young entrepreneurs and start-ups are looking for, a lot of flexibility because these companies grow very fast. And you don\u2019t want to overpay because if you go into a traditional office space with four people but you know you will be growing to 20 people, you know you will probably need an office space for 20 people and pay the whole [amount],\u201d he said. </p> <p>Beyond the needs of freelancers and start-ups, the concept of flexible space has become firmly entrenched in the corporate world, both for the short-term - when sales reps need meeting spaces for presentations and for longer projects.</p> <p>Richard Morris, the boss of office rental stalwart Regus, said when Royal Dutch Shell was pursuing the acquisition of BG Group they needed somewhere private and so set up in short-term offices in The Hague and in London. Regus itself has doubled in size in the last five years, said Morris, describing the influence of the mobile working trend as a \u201ckey enabler\u201d. </p> <p>He said: \u201cHow do you attract talented people? You create working practices and working environments for those people that enable them to have work life balances, to improve employee engagement and that is another thing we can see driving the demand for flexible workspace.\u201d </p> <p>Rahmani puts the average cost of a desk in London at \u00a3256 a month while WeWork\u2019s Fore Street office\u2019s dedicated desks start at \u00a3425 a month, a figure which changes depending on the location of the office (there is another pricing structure for hot desks). \u201cThe model makes sense on both sides. We have seen that co-working spaces that are doing well are making more money per square foot than they would otherwise renting out the whole unit to one tenant and so it is a win win model,\u201d he said.</p> <p><strong>You can read our archive of The innovators columns <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/series/the-innovators\">here </a>or <a href=\"http://www.biginnovationcentre.com/the-innovators-column\">on the Big Innovation Centre website</a> where you will find more information on how Big Innovation Centre supports innovative enterprise in Britain and globally.</strong><br></p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "At times, Mary Jo White sounds almost like Wyatt Earp, or some other law enforcer from the Old West \u2026 only without the gun. \u201cYou have to be tough\u201d has been White\u2019s motto since taking over the Securities and Exchange Commission from Mary Schapiro in spring 2013. \u201cThe SEC is a law enforcement agency,\u201d she told the Wall Street Journal. \u201cYou have to try to send as strong a message as you can, across as broad a swath of the market as you regulate, and that\u2019s pretty broad.\u201d On the surface, she has followed through. The SEC filed 686 enforcement actions in its 2013 fiscal year. In its 2014 fiscal year, White bragged that the number soared to 755, \u201cthe highest number of cases in the history of this commission\u201d. Moreover, she has noted that the agency levied a whopping $4.1bn in penalties as part of those actions. It all sounds great. But is it? Securities lawyers \u2013 understandably enough \u2013 haven\u2019t been big fans of the SEC\u2019s saber-rattling, perhaps because it\u2019s giving their clients a tough time, often for issues that they consider minor. Hanging on to law enforcement terminology, the SEC is cracking down on \u201cbroken windows\u201d offenses: stuff that previously might have warranted only a rap on the knuckles. In the 2013 fiscal year, for instance, 132 of those 686 cases involved the relatively plain vanilla issue of failing to report a change in stock ownership or a stock sale by a corporate insider, like a director or CEO, in a timely manner. These are a far cry from what we usually think of when we think of \u201cSEC enforcement actions\u201d: they aren\u2019t accounting irregularities, fraud, or market manipulation. In 2014, 107 of 755 cases were delinquent filing actions. The securities team at Cooley LLP pointed out in a review of the SEC\u2019s enforcement actions that some of these \u201ccrimes\u201d actually could be no more accidental oversights. In other cases, the transactions didn\u2019t go unreported \u2013 the individuals just didn\u2019t meet the SEC\u2019s deadlines. (In other words, the lawyers argue, it\u2019s a bit like when we pay our credit card bills late.) Then, too, they argue that this is a real departure in the SEC\u2019s traditional approach to cracking down on late filings only when it\u2019s part of a bigger problem \u2013 part of a broader fraud. And why charge a company for \u201ccontributing to filing failures\u201d by a director or other insider? For Urska Velikonja, a law professor at Emory University, the answer is easy: the SEC is padding what she believes to be \u201cdeeply flawed\u201d enforcement statistics. In a study slated for publication in the Cornell Law Review, she calculates that the way the agency has counted the number of cases it has pursued has made it looked like a far fiercer and more effective sheriff than it may actually be. Velikonja\u2019s data and her arguments are compelling, if not altogether new: they simply offer a more objective and unbiased view of the same argument previously advanced by securities lawyers like Marc Fagel, a partner in the San Francisco office of Gibson Dunn &amp; Crutcher. In an analysis of the 2014 data, Fagel noted that 80% of the cases came from five big, targeted actions that resulted in a large number of individuals being charged simultaneously for reporting-related violations that didn\u2019t rise to the level of fraud. Those are some of the cases that Velikonja criticizes as \u201cpadding\u201d, since they don\u2019t require much investigation. She also takes aim at double counting (where the agency counts actions that are taken aginst the same individuals two or three times in different venues, or counts the enforcement against, say, a CEO and his or her company as separate enforcement action) and other forms of creative mathematics. Velikonja\u2019s survey of the data will provide lots of fodder for the SEC\u2019s critics \u2013 of whom there are many. The study hit the news within days of the end of the agency\u2019s 2015 fiscal year on 30 September; within weeks, White will take the podium to reveal and discuss the agency\u2019s enforcement track record for the last 12 months. Perhaps White and the SEC shouldn\u2019t have been as triumphalist as they have been in past months, pointing over and over again to those 755 cases as evidence that the sheriff has been successful in organizing her posse and is riding out in pursuit of the stock market\u2019s black hats. On the other hand, should they now have to vigorously defend every enforcement action they\u2019ve taken, and every strategic measure to patrol the markets, as rigorously as they will have to in the wake of Velikonja\u2019s provocative conclusions? Probably not. While there is legitimate criticism to be levied against the way in which the SEC presents and discusses enforcement data, it might be dangerous to cross the line and start querying whether or not these are pointless exercises. Sure, they boost the enforcement division\u2019s stats and make them look effective. But as Marc Fagel of Gibson, Dunn pointed out, the big enforcement \u201csweeps\u201d that generated some of those cases about which Velikonja writes dismissively draw attention early to precisely the kind of companies that history suggests are most ripe for future frauds: those without current financial reports. Moreover, what the SEC has done doesn\u2019t necessarily tell us what it is working on or will work on in future: an active and aggressive enforcement division (even if it\u2019s only writing the equivalent of parking tickets today) might be in the early stages of developing a complex fraud or insider trading case, or be better prepared to spot a rogue trader in the early stages of his shenanigans as a result of their small-scale enforcement activities. Big, dramatic cases obviously appeal most \u2013 what\u2019s not to like about really sticking it to an evil insider trader or a bankster? But the fewer of these there are, or the more time and effort required to build those cases, the more White needs to rely on big overall numbers when testifying to Congress and justifying her budget and the size of her staff, which has grown from 1,266 in 2014 to nearly 1,340 (budgeted) in 2015. The risk now is that SEC critics will seize on Velikonja\u2019s data to push for cuts to the agency\u2019s budget, just as it is trying to come to grips with new challenges, like the role of high-frequency trading, to its enforcement operations. In the years leading up to the 2008 financial crisis, morale and resources at the SEC was at a particularly low ebb, making it strikingly ineffective. Do we really want to remove whatever fangs it is in the process of re-growing today because of the way data is reported? By all means, let\u2019s focus on what the enforcement division is doing, and ask for an explanation of why the agency is pursuing this \u201cbroken windows\u201d policy. And let\u2019s ask why the SEC has levied record fines, but has done such a notably bad job when it comes to collecting and disbursing those penalties that the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office has told it to clean up its act. Every watchdog organization needs to be scrutinized, in its turn; transparency is a great thing. But let\u2019s remember that just because the SEC\u2019s enforcement division isn\u2019t marching the wolves of Wall Street off to jail in handcuffs each week on the nightly news doesn\u2019t mean that we don\u2019t need the agency and its resources on the job, putting cases together piece by piece. Let\u2019s make sure they have the resources to keep doing that.",

      "bodyText": "Napoleon was wrong. This is a nation not of shopkeepers but of estate agents. The UK economy ebbs and flows according to the state of the property market, sometimes gently but more commonly with giant waves of speculation followed by an inspection of the wreckage as the tide goes out. Warning: although the sea currently looks calm, the wind is freshening. The economy is sailing into a storm. This course was charted by George Osborne three years ago in order to get the economy out of the doldrums. Back in 2012, the chancellor was a worried man. His budget had flopped, the recovery from the deep recession of 2008-09 had stalled, and his deficit reduction plan was way behind schedule. He was booed at the London Olympics and there was talk of him being reshuffled. Revisions to official data now show the economy was not quite as becalmed as it appeared at the time, but faced with headwinds from the crisis in the eurozone, an enfeebled banking system and Osborne\u2019s own austerity measures, it was making slow progress. As a result, there was a change of tack. Osborne had arrived in office promising to rebalance the economy by promoting a \u201cmarch of the makers\u201d. In the summer of 2012, he decided the best way to get the economy going again and to quell an incipient mutiny was to revive a sluggish housing market. Between them, the Treasury and the Bank of England came up with Funding for Lending, a scheme that provided banks with incentives to increase their business and mortgage lending. This was perhaps the single most important initiative taken by the government in the last parliament. It did little to increase flows of funds to industry but it worked wonders for the domestic property market. Within months, sales of property were going up, fears of recession were banished, the Labour party was wrong-footed and Osborne never looked back. He will be rightly feted by the Tory faithful this week as the architect of election victory. This victory, though, has come at a cost: the risk that an overstimulated housing market will eventually crash and bring the rest of the economy down with it. The preconditions for another boom-bust are already in place. The first is that borrowing is cheap and readily available. Official interest rates have been at 0.5% for more than six years and now the housing market is moving again mortgage providers are competing to offer the best deals to borrowers. The second is that Osborne was not content to boost the market simply through Funding for Lending. Instead, he introduced other measures that had the effect of boosting housing demand: Help to Buy, changes in stamp duty that resulted in 98% of buyers paying less, and a more generous inheritance tax regime. The third is that the low level of inflation \u2013 for both the economy as a whole and house prices \u2013 can breed policy complacency. That was what happened in the early 2000s, when cheap imports from China and other developing countries bore down on the cost of living and diverted attention from the nascent housing bubble. Four years before the sub-prime mortgage crisis broke in 2007, the then chief economist of the Bank for International Settlements, Bill White, warned that financial imbalances can build up even when inflation is low and stable. The warning was not taken nearly seriously enough. Another dose of Chinese-inspired deflation is heading Britain\u2019s way. Commodity prices are weak because China\u2019s demand for fuel and raw materials has slackened. In addition, Beijing is likely to use a cheaper currency to flood the global economy with cut-price exports. It will be some time before inflation in the UK returns to its official 2% target. Meanwhile, the Office for Budget Responsibility is forecasting that household debt as a proportion of the economy\u2019s annual output (gross domestic product) will have returned to its pre-crisis peak by the end of this parliament. Following the marked increase of indebtedness in the late 1990s and early 2000s, there has been only modest deleveraging by households subsequently. The reason household debt is rising is simple. People are borrowing more to buy homes that are going up in price. One measure of affordability is the ratio of house prices to earnings, which has been monitored by the Halifax for more than 30 years. This ratio peaked at 5.86 in the summer of 2007, the eve of the financial crisis, and troughed at 4.40 at the time Funding for Lending was announced. Subsequently, it has risen in every quarter and is back to 5.26. Borrowing has been concentrated in the buy-to-let sector. The first mortgages for buy-to-let landlords were made available in 1996: there are now more than 1,000 separate products on offer. As the Bank of England noted in the record of the meeting of its financial policy committee, the outstanding stock of buy-to-let lending has increased by 40% since 2008, compared with a 2% rise for owner-occupation lending. One in six mortgages are now for buy to let. These statistics help explain the anger of generation rent. They are going to be even angrier if this latest example of Britain\u2019s grotesque misallocation of capital to non-productive uses ends in tears. The Bank of England thinks there is a risk that it will. It notes that buy-to-let mortgages are typically extended on an interest-only basis. Landlords expect rents to cover their borrowing costs and for their properties to rise in value. If for any reason rents or house prices were to fall, buy-to-let landlords would sell up in droves, turning a downturn into a full-blown crash. But although Threadneedle Street is worried about the buy-to-let market, it is not yet worried enough to do anything about it. Osborne gave the bank new and extensive powers to curb excesses in the housing market, including the ability to rein in buy-to-let lending. So far it has decided not to use them or to resort to a much blunter instrument: higher interest rates. Meanwhile, demand for housing is rising as a result both of a growing population and the UK\u2019s ludicrously generous tax system. If the government was serious about preventing another bubble in the property market it would be announcing a long overdue reform of council tax bands and the levying of capital gains tax on main residences. Fear of upsetting owner occupiers means both are political nonstarters. Despite his tightening of the tax regime for buy-to-let included in the summer 2015 budget, Osborne has announced state subsidies for owner occupation and made the tax system even more generous. The assumption seems to be that the bank will blow away the thunder clouds gathering on the horizon through timely increases in interest rates and the use of its new regulatory powers. That truly is the triumph of hope over experience.",

London\u2019s economy is forecast to grow 27% by 2025 \u2013 almost twice the combined rate of growth in northern English cities, the report by law firm Irwin Mitchell and the Centre for Economics &amp; Business Research (CEBR) found. The economy of London will be worth almost \u00a3450bn in 10 years \u2013 more than \u00a3110bn higher than the total output of cities in the north-west, the north-east and Yorkshire and the Humber, the report, UK Powerhouse: Supporting Economic Strength and Bridging the Prosperity Gap, found. The findings take account of the proposals announced by George Osborne to revitalise Greater Manchester and other northern cities by improving transport links and devolving powers from Westminster. The project is centred on Greater Manchester and largely ignores the north-east. Osborne declared Sheffield as a second powerhouse last week. The report, published before the chancellor\u2019s speech to the Conservative party conference, found that business leaders in the north were unenthusiastic about the government\u2019s HS2 high-speed rail link as a way to revitalise their cities. HS2 will run from London to Birmingham at first and will then be extended to the north west. Businessmen favoured improving roads and local rail services over HS2. More than half the 1,000 surveyed by YouGov for the report wanted local decision making on business rates and infrastructure improvements. Many also wanted a local living wage instead of the national rate introduced by the chancellor. Scott Corfe, head of macroeconomics at CEBR, said: \u201cAfter winning the May general election, David Cameron vowed to lead a \u2018one nation\u2019 Conservative government. Yet significant announcements to spread growth across the UK have been surprisingly lacking to date. \u201cWithout more radical measures, David Cameron risks breaking his vow, particularly as further austerity has the potential to hold back the economies of some of the UK\u2019s poorest regions. It is vital that private enterprise is allowed to thrive in these regions as a way of offsetting austerity.\u201d CEBR backed the business leaders\u2019 views and proposed other measures including tax competition between regions, more enterprise zones around universities and the devolution of air passenger duty in England. Four of the five fastest-growing urban centres in the UK are in the south of England: London, Milton Keynes, Cambridge and Oxford \u2013 along with Aberdeen. The slowest-growing cities are Hull, Bradford, Middlesbrough, Swansea and Belfast. CEBR predicted that the gap would persist over the next decade without more action to invigorate underperforming cities. It said London will gain more than 537,000 jobs, up 11.1%, compared with increases of 8.6% for Greater Manchester, 7.6% for Leeds and 6.9% for Sheffield by 2025. Niall Baker, head of business legal services at Irwin Mitchell, said: \u201cAlthough it is good news that London and the south-east will continue to prosper, it\u2019s clear that a radical rethink of the government\u2019s wealth spreading agenda is required. Investment in infrastructure is one part of the mix and we believe that the government needs to listen to the voice of business and employ a range of policies tailored to different regions.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "While the Conservatives and many members of the media go on and on about the putative need for Labour to apologise for the deficit that was caused not by Gordon Brown but by the banking crisis, an apology has come from an unexpected quarter. In a recent interview with Margaret Thatcher\u2019s biographer, Charles Moore, for the Policy Institute at King\u2019s College, London, the man who ran Thatcher\u2019s press office for 11 years, my old friend Sir Bernard Ingham, said about Thatcherism: \u201cI\u2019m sorry, desperately sorry, that so many people had to suffer the consequences.\u201d Now, it is true that this admission was made in the context of Ingham\u2019s claim that those years he worked for her \u201cproduced very substantial improvement in the country\u201d \u2013 a debatable point \u2013 but it is interesting that he made the apology. He also had the good grace to add: \u201cI wish some privatisation had been carried out better [sic].\u201d I\u2019ll say! Now, if there was one economic concept that successive Thatcher administrations were proud of it was privatisation. Rather more so than of monetarism. It was Peter Jay who once joked that instructing Thatcher about monetarism was like showing Genghis Khan a map of the world. But it was privatisation that those Thatcher governments fumbled their way into exporting to the rest of the world. It is therefore a remarkable turn of events that we now have a Conservative chancellor of the exchequer, a veritable son of Thatcher, who has recently gone kowtowing to a communist Chinese government, pleading with them to provide finance for the construction in Britain of a nuclear power station by a French nationalised industry. I am not making this up. Quite apart from the controversy stirred up over Osborne\u2019s cloying approach to a regime notorious for its abuse of human rights; quite apart from the fact that experts with far greater knowledge of the energy industry than most of us have raised serious doubts about the financial basis of the project, Osborne\u2019s cavalier attitude lands him on weak ground when it comes to opposing Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s approach to the railways. Osborne, unlike many Chinese, has been democratically elected and has every human right to believe what he likes. But it was good to hear Labour\u2019s new shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, pick up this point in his speech to the Labour conference in Brighton last week. Because there were so many other interesting aspects of McDonnell\u2019s speech, the following passage did not receive wide coverage. It is therefore worth repeating: \u201cI found the Conservatives\u2019 rant against Jeremy\u2019s proposal to bring rail back into public ownership ironic when George Osborne was touring China selling off to the Chinese state bank any British asset he could lay his hands on.\u201d It was a Conservative MP and railway enthusiast Robert Adley who observed that rail privatisation would be \u201cthe poll tax on wheels\u201d, and so it proved to be. Moreover, not many people realise that the \u201cprivatised\u201d system has actually had to be partly renationalised and is costing the taxpayer \u00a34bn a year in subsidies. George Osborne is what is known in the trade as a \u201cchancer\u201d. Chancers often get found out. William Hill has made the chancellor hot favourite to succeed David Cameron. We shall see. The wider implications of his unnecessary policy of austerity are gradually being brought home to the middle classes and all those middle-England voters whom the new leaders of the Labour party are accused of ignoring. The \u201ccuts\u201d are affecting surgeons, GP surgeries, local authority social services for the old and the infirm, and reaching into many other corners of everyday life. McDonnell is right to oppose the policy of austerity for austerity\u2019s sake. His predecessor, Ed Balls, recently said to me that this must be the first shadow chancellor who is to the left of your correspondent. I wonder. McDonnell has emphasised that he would \u201cnot tackle the deficit on the backs of middle- and low-earners, and especially by attacking the poorest in our society\u201d, but as an acquaintance observed when I said I thought McDonnell\u2019s conference speech was a breath of fresh air: \u201cBut he still goes on about the deficit, and you told me the deficit was not the problem!\u201d Quite right. It was not the problem. It was the solution. The deficit was the consequence of the banking crisis, not of Brown\u2019s policies. When the banking crisis led to the collapse of demand in the economy in 2008-2009, the deficit was necessary to prevent the fall from becoming even steeper. There are those who say that recent revisions to the statistics mean that the crisis was not as bad as some made out. To them I offer the words last week of Joe Grice, the chief economist at the Office for National Statistics, who commented that it \u201cremains the sharpest downturn and slowest recovery on record\u201d. When recoveries are slow, deficits come down slowly. I suspect that McDonnell feels that, because there is such widespread misunderstanding of this, he has to pay heed to popular opinion and sound more \u201corthodox\u201d than he really believes is necessary. But at least he is putting the emphasis on attacking what \u201causterity\u201d actually means in practice. Whether or not the Corbyn team wins the confidence of the electorate it promises to be a very strong opposition on the economic front.",

      "bodyText": "Inevitably, one day, there will be a Hollywood film about the rigging of Libor. \u201cIn a city where cash is king,\u201d you can almost imagine the trailer voiceover beginning, \u201cone man\u2019s greed dwarfs all others.\u201d Hang on a minute, though: that might not work because, according to the Serious Fraud Office, there was more than one bloke trying to fiddle with the benchmark interest rate. So, following its successful prosecution of former UBS trader Tom Hayes in August, the SFO is back for a sequel. This week Southwark crown court will be showing Libor II \u2013 the story continues, with a second trial of City folk accused of being involved in manipulating the interbank rate. The trials of Darrell Read, Colin Goodman, Danny Wilkinson (all former employees of Icap), Terry Farr, James Gilmour (both formerly at RP Martin) and Noel Cryan (from Tullett Prebon) are due to begin on Tuesday. Watchers will need to bring a large bag of popcorn, as it\u2019s scheduled to last for between 12 and 14 weeks. Anyway, as this page is keen to avoid getting any closer to contempt of court, we\u2019ll simply leave you with one of the best lines from trial one, which included Hayes\u2019s view of how to get things done in the City. \u201cJust give the cash desk a Mars bar,\u201d he was once recorded saying, \u201cand they\u2019ll set [Libor] wherever you want.\u201d Confidence scarce at Glencore And now in our regular \u201cPR problem to beset Glencore this week\u201d slot, we bring you the purchasing plans of Leonhard Fischer, a non-exec at the commodity trader who will (surely?) be investing his own cash in the embattled company this week. You\u2019ll recall that Glencore is in crisis after the City didn\u2019t believe boss Ivan Glasenberg\u2019s assessment of the firm\u2019s finances. Shareholders then forced the trader into the humiliating U-turn of unveiling an impromptu plan to cut debts, only for the market to turn its nose up at the detail of that plan too, so the shares got routed again. This led to last week\u2019s parade of Glencore directors buying shares \u2013 in which it only remains for Fischer to cough up. He\u2019s lagging behind even fellow non-exec William Macaulay, whose \u00a31.5m purchase on Friday may fail to convince as a vote of confidence. Macaulay\u2019s investment firm, First Reserve, has dumped almost \u00a3400m of Glencore shares over the past year \u2013 which, a Glencore spokesman impatiently explains, is \u201ccompletely different\u201d. Of course it is. Macaulay is only the chairman and chief executive of First Reserve, so not in a position of any seniority. Waiting for Tesco to come good We are approaching the first anniversary of one of the most memorable interventions by a retail analyst of our times: the classic note penned by Sanford C Bernstein analyst Bruno Monteyne after months of Tesco\u2019s share price being in the dumps. In November 2014 he broke ranks from the gloomy consensus and wrote that there was little Tesco \u201ccan do wrong in the next two years that isn\u2019t in [the share] price\u201d, a point he followed up by telling the Times: \u201cThe discussion now is whether we\u2019ll merely see Tesco stabilise or whether this is the start of a major recovery.\u201d Sadly for Monteyne, those final sentiments appeared in the paper on the same day that the supermarket chain unveiled another massive profits warning, which triggered a further dip in the share price. Still, as the City marks the anniversary of his corker (gala dinner, guest speaker Michael Fish, that kind of thing) it seems his reputation has itself stabilised, along with Tesco\u2019s shares, which have maintained their status of being at their lowest level since 2003. Which brings us to Tesco\u2019s interim results this week, which are expected to unveil an underwhelming package of improving margins but falling same-store sales. Maybe Monteyne was (half) right.",

      "body": "<p>Inevitably, one day, there will be a Hollywood film about the rigging of Libor. \u201cIn a city where cash is king,\u201d you can almost imagine the trailer voiceover beginning, \u201cone man\u2019s greed dwarfs all others.\u201d</p> <p>Hang on a minute, though: that might not work because, according to the Serious Fraud Office, there was more than one bloke trying to fiddle with the benchmark interest rate. So, following its successful prosecution of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/aug/03/libor-rigging-tom-hayes-sfo\" title=\"\">former UBS trader Tom Hayes</a> in August, the SFO is back for a sequel.</p> <p>This week Southwark crown court will be showing Libor II \u2013 the story continues, with a second trial of City folk accused of being involved in manipulating the interbank rate. The trials of Darrell Read, Colin Goodman, Danny Wilkinson (all former employees of Icap), Terry Farr, James Gilmour (both formerly at RP Martin) and Noel Cryan (from Tullett Prebon) are due to begin on Tuesday. Watchers will need to bring a large bag of popcorn, as it\u2019s scheduled to last for between 12 and 14 weeks.</p> <p>Anyway, as this page is keen to avoid getting any closer to contempt of court, we\u2019ll simply leave you with one of the best lines from trial one, which included Hayes\u2019s view of how to get things done in the City. \u201cJust give the cash desk a Mars bar,\u201d he was once recorded saying, \u201cand they\u2019ll set [Libor] wherever you want.\u201d</p> <h2>Confidence scarce at Glencore</h2> <p>And now in our regular \u201cPR problem to beset Glencore this week\u201d slot, we bring you the purchasing plans of Leonhard Fischer, a non-exec at the commodity trader who will (surely?) be investing his own cash in the embattled company this week.</p> <p>You\u2019ll recall that Glencore is in crisis after the City didn\u2019t believe boss Ivan Glasenberg\u2019s assessment of the firm\u2019s finances. Shareholders then forced the trader into the humiliating U-turn of unveiling an impromptu plan to cut debts, only for the market to turn its nose up at the detail of that plan too, so the shares got routed again.</p> <p>This led to last week\u2019s parade of Glencore directors buying shares \u2013 in which it only remains for Fischer to cough up. He\u2019s lagging behind even fellow non-exec William Macaulay, whose \u00a31.5m purchase on Friday may fail to convince as a vote of confidence.</p> <p>Macaulay\u2019s investment firm, First Reserve, has dumped almost \u00a3400m of Glencore shares over the past year \u2013 which, a Glencore spokesman impatiently explains, is \u201ccompletely different\u201d. Of course it is. Macaulay is only the chairman and chief executive of First Reserve, so not in a position of any seniority.</p> <h2>Waiting for Tesco to come good</h2> <p>We are approaching the first anniversary of one of the most memorable interventions by a retail analyst of our times: the classic note penned by Sanford C Bernstein analyst <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/dec/14/turkey-time-for-ftse-traders-nervous\" title=\"\">Bruno Monteyne after months of Tesco\u2019s share price being in the dumps</a>.</p> <p>In November 2014 he broke ranks from the gloomy consensus and wrote that there was little Tesco \u201ccan do wrong in the next two years that isn\u2019t in [the share] price\u201d, a point he followed up by telling the <em>Times</em>: \u201cThe discussion now is whether we\u2019ll merely see Tesco stabilise or whether this is the start of a major recovery.\u201d</p> <p>Sadly for Monteyne, those final sentiments appeared in the paper on the same day that the supermarket chain unveiled another massive profits warning, which triggered a further dip in the share price. Still, as the City marks the anniversary of his corker (gala dinner, guest speaker Michael Fish, that kind of thing) it seems his reputation has itself stabilised, along with Tesco\u2019s shares, which have maintained their status of being at their lowest level since 2003.</p> <p>Which brings us to Tesco\u2019s interim results this week, which are expected to unveil an underwhelming package of improving margins but falling same-store sales. Maybe Monteyne was (half) right.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The body examining the practices of the car industry following the Volkswagen emissions scandal has been accused of a major conflict of interest after it emerged that nearly three quarters of its funding comes from the companies it is investigating. According to its latest annual report, the Vehicle Certification Agency receives 69.91% of its income from car manufacturers, who pay it to certify that their vehicles are meeting emissions and safety standards. The transport secretary, Patrick McLoughlin, said last month that the VCA, which also receives government funding, would be responsible for re-running tests on a variety of makes of diesel cars and investigating their real-world emissions. The announcement followed the revelation from the US Environmental Protection Agency last month that Volkswagen had installed illegal software to cheat emission tests, allowing its diesel cars to produce up to 40 times more pollution than is permitted. However, the apparent conflict of interest raised by VCA\u2019s funding has prompted lawyers to demand a truly independent investigation into the industry, and will raise fresh concerns over the government\u2019s handling of the issue of air pollution. Last week the Observer revealed how the government has been seeking to block EU legislation that would force member states to carry out surprise checks on car emissions. It has also been accused of ignoring a supreme court ruling that the government needed to urgently draw up significant plans to tackle the air pollution problem, which has been in breach of EU limits for years and is linked to thousands of premature deaths each year. Alan Andrews, a lawyer at ClientEarth, said the VCA\u2019s funding sources made it an inappropriate body to investigate the car industry. He said: \u201cThese figures show the agency relies for funding on the very industry it is meant to be investigating. We need a robust, transparent and independent investigation into whether the use of so-called \u2018defeat devices\u2019 are widespread in the UK car industry. \u201cTransport secretary Patrick McLoughlin must act now to ensure an outside body investigates this scandal. We cannot continue to risk the health of thousands of people a year by allowing watchdogs to have a too cosy and too close relationship with polluters.\u201d The scandal has wiped more than a third off Volkswagen\u2019s share price, forced the resignation of its chief executive and been the source of huge embarrassment for the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, who was accused of being too close to Europe\u2019s biggest car manufacturer. Volkswagen has revealed that 1.2m vehicles in the UK are involved in the emissions scandal, which means that more than one in 10 diesel cars on the road are affected. It said the diesel vehicles include 508,276 Volkswagen cars, 393,450 Audis, 76,773 Seats, 131,569 \u0160kodas and 79,838 Volkswagen commercial vehicles. According to research compiled by Adac, Europe\u2019s largest motoring organisation, diesel cars from Renault, Nissan, Hyundai, Citro\u00ebn, Fiat, Volvo and other manufacturers have also been found to emit substantially higher levels of pollution under more realistic driving conditions. There is no suggestion of cheating, but only a quarter of the 79 cars Adac tested matched official results on the existing EU test. A Department for Transport spokesman said: \u201cTo help provide value for taxpayers, the VCA cover their operating costs by charging manufacturers for the services they provide. This is the case with many regulators, including the ORR. Whilst the VCA charges the industry for its services, its governance framework is set by Government.\u201d",
