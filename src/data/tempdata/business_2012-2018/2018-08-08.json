      "bodyText": "Qantas and Virgin are facing increasing pressure from unions, advocacy groups and the public to refuse to participate in the forced removal of asylum seekers from Australia, as airlines around the world boycott deportations. But both of Australia\u2019s major carriers have refused to rule out taking part in future deportations. The issue of corporate co-operation in forced removals came to renewed international attention last month when Swedish student Elin Ersson refused to sit down on a plane at Gothenburg airport, protesting that an Afghan man was being deported \u201cto hell\u201d. She succeeded, and the man was removed from the plane. Similar protests have been staged in Australia, resulting, in some cases, in criminal charges laid against protesters. In June in the UK, Virgin Atlantic said it would no longer assist the home office in deporting people classed as illegal immigrants, after growing unease over the wrongful removal of members of the Windrush generation to Caribbean countries, despite their status as British citizens. In the US, airlines including American, Frontier, Southwest and United airlines have refused to carry immigrant children being separated from their families under that country\u2019s new \u201czero tolerance\u201d border policies. Pilots on Germany\u2019s national carrier, Lufthansa, have repeatedly refused to fly asylum seekers to countries where they may face danger. The advocacy group the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility (ACCR) is meeting with Qantas on Friday and is seeking to make representations to Virgin. The ACCR is arguing both airlines should refuse to take part in forced deportations to countries where people might face persecution or danger: most deportations are to Sri Lanka, Afghanistan and Vietnam, where persecution of minorities or political dissidents are well-documented. ACCR says airlines should also boycott transferring asylum seekers and refugees between places of detention onshore and offshore, arguing Australia\u2019s detention regime breaches international law. A statement signed by more than 60 representatives of business, unions, human rights organisations and academia argues companies have obligations to respect human rights, and to ignore international legal obligations can damage a company\u2019s reputation and risk its financial interests. \u201cTo discharge their responsibility, airlines should not participate in deportations where there is evidence that the fundamental human rights to an adequate legal process have been denied, as well as where there is a real risk of serious, irreparable harm to an individual.\u201d The statement is signed by, among others, the former human rights commissioner Gillian Triggs, the Booker prize-winning novelist Thomas Keneally, the general secretary of the International Trade Union Confederation, Sharan Burrow, and the president of the ACTU, Michele O\u2019Neill. \u201cNo person should be forcibly removed from Australia into a situation where they face being harmed or killed,\u201d O\u2019Neill told the Guardian. \u201cAirlines must take seriously their responsibility to respect human rights.\u201d A petition calling on Qantas to refuse to participate in the \u201cinvoluntary removal\u201d of married Tamil asylum seekers Priya and Nades and their two Queensland-born daughters has attracted more than 13,000 signatures. \u201cIn the past, Qantas has carried out transfers within Australia of asylum seekers about to be deported to danger,\u201d Refugee Action Collective spokesman Chris Breen said. \u201cAsylum seekers deported to Sri Lanka have been imprisoned and tortured. \u201cA UN report last year described the use of torture in Sri Lanka as \u2018routine\u2019. Catholic asylum seekers deported to Vietnam have been harassed, beaten and jailed \u2013 despite assurances given to the Australian government. Qantas is an iconic Australian airline that should not be participating in human rights abuses.\u201d But the Australian government also regularly uses charter flights \u2013 at a cost of upwards of $100,000 a flight - to move asylum seekers. The last deportation of Sri Lankan asylum seekers back to Colombo took place on a charter flight. A spokesman for Qantas told the Guardian: \u201cWe appreciate that this is a sensitive issue. \u201cThe government and courts are best placed to make decisions on complex immigration matters, not airlines.\u201d A spokesman for Virgin Australia said the airline \u201cworks with a number of government organisations to transport passengers for a range of reasons\u201d. \u201cVirgin Australia complies with Australian immigration law and will continue to take advice on this matter from the relevant authorities.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "China hits back against latest US tariffs; pound hit by Brexit worries \u2013 as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Time for a recap. The trade dispute between the US and China has escalated further, as neither side shows any appetite for backing down. The Chinese government unveiled tariffs on $16bn of American goods today. Medical equipment, fuels, fish meal, wood waste, paper and paper waste, metal scraps, cars and bicycles are all on list of products targeted. Beijing was retaliating against Washington\u2019s decision to slap tariffs on an extra $16bn of Chinese goods overnight. These latest tit-for-tat moves mean there are levies on $50bn of goods moving each way between the two countries. So far, China\u2019s economy seems to be holding up under the strain. Trade figures released overnight showed that exports rose by 12.2% year-on-year in July, while exports jumped by over 27%. The decision to allow the yuan to fall against the US dollar may be supporting manufacturers, analysts say. But if the situation escalates, the global economy could be badly hurt. With the two sides deadlocked, a ship full of soybeans has been anchored off China\u2019s coast for a month - as its owners ponder whether to swallow the tariffs. Fears of a hard Brexit have hurt the pound again. Sterling fell to an 11-month low against the US dollar, at $1.2854. Against the euro, it dropped to \u20ac1.1091, a nine-month low. Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index, explains why traders are worried: he possibility of a no-deal Brexit has been looming over the pound for a while now but it seems to have asserted itself in traders\u2019 minds even more this week since Bank of England governor Mark Carney said that the likelihood was now \u201cuncomfortably high\u201d, a sentiment later echoed by Britain\u2019s trade secretary Liam Fox. Elsewhere in the markets, Tesla board members have confirmed they are evaluating whether to take the electric car market private. There\u2019s still some cynicism, though, as to whether Elon Musk will actually pull the idea off. And the oil price has slipped, due to trade war worries and a smaller-than-expected drop in US crude inventories. That\u2019s probably all for today. GW It\u2019s a month since the US and China imposed their first wave of tariffs, in early July. And ever since, a cargo ship full of soybeans has been waiting at anchor off the port of Dalian. Having failed to reach China before the deadline, the vessel is in limbo while its owners decide what to do. If they unload the beans now, they (or the buyer) would incur hefty tariffs. My colleague Rob Davies has been looking into the issue, and explains: A shipment of soybeans worth more than $20m (\u00a315.5m) has been bobbing aimlessly in the Pacific Ocean for a month, a casualty of the escalating trade war between China and the US. Lingering uncertainty over the cargo\u2019s fate offered a timely reminder of the fallout from a dispute that intensified on Wednesday, as the US president, Donald Trump, unveiled a second round of tariffs on $16bn of Chinese goods, prompting Beijing to respond in kind. The Peak Pegasus, a 229 metre bulk carrier weighing 43,000 tonnes, has become the reluctant symbol of the potential consequences of this tit-for-tat trade spat. The ship, owned by JP Morgan Asset Management, was scheduled to unload about 70,000 tonnes of American soybeans in the Chinese port of Dalian on 6 July, shortly after Trump imposed a first round of tariffs on $34bn-worth of goods. As it rushed to shore in the hope of clearing customs before Beijing imposed retaliatory tariffs, the ship \u2013 and its protein-rich cargo \u2013 became an unlikely internet sensation on the Chinese social media platform Weibo. However, the vessel arrived just too late and has been sailing around in circles ever since while the cargo\u2019s owners, understood to be the agricultural commodity trading house Louis Dreyfus, decide what to do.... More here: The US-China trade row is also being blamed for falling oil prices today. Brent crude has tumbled by 3.5% today to $71.99 per barrel, while US crude is down 3.8% at $66.60. Economists are citing the risks to global growth posed by tariffs Abhishek Kumar, senior energy analyst at Interfax Energy in London, says: \u201cThe US-China trade war is set to worsen, and its impact on oil prices will be gradual as the situation develops. Crude oil and refined products affected by additional duties will reduce their competitiveness in the Chinese market.\u201d The latest oil inventory figures from America have also hit the oil price. Crude inventories fell by 1.4 million barrels in the latest week, less than half the 3.3 million barrel draw analysts had expected. Trade wars can have many casualties. And the dispute between America and China is threatening the future of a paper mill in the state of Arkansas. Associated Press has the details: A Chinese company\u2019s announcement two years ago that it would spend more than $1 billion and hire hundreds of workers for a paper mill on the outskirts of this rural college town was seen as a much-needed shot in the arm for the region\u2019s economy. A web video promoting Arkadelphia \u201cIt\u2019s a great place to call home!\u201d continues to tout the Sun Paper project and its potential to generate jobs and boost development. But optimism has been giving way to concern in recent months amid President Donald Trump\u2019s escalating trade dispute with China. The threat of a full-blown trade war has delayed the project further and prompted the state\u2019s governor to send his top economic development official to China to make sure it stays on track. It also has caused other Chinese companies considering investing in Arkansas to put their plans on hold. \u201cIt\u2019s like a dark cloud hanging over the future of the project,\u201d Stephen Bell, the president and chief executive officer of the Arkadelphia Area Chamber of Commerce. \u201cRight now, the clouds are off on the horizon. But I think no one knows where the trade situation is going right now.\u201d.... More here. By announcing new tariffs today, China\u2019s is sticking firmly to its tit-for-tat policy on trade, says Art Hogan, chief market strategist at investment bank B. Riley. That means that the trade war is likely to escalate, Hogan warns (via CNN): \u201cOur $16 billion comes at a scheduled time, which comes up on the 23rd. China said we see your $16 billion and we\u2019ll match your $16 billion.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019ll pretty much match what we do until they have no more levers to pull. The bad news is the trade war fears in China are escalating. The major concern right now in trade is China. In case you missed this earlier, we learned overnight that China\u2019s imports and exports both rose in July. Exports jumped by over 12% year on year, indicating that the trade war hasn\u2019t caused serious damage yet. These photos from Lianyungang Port, in the Jiangsu Province of China, show that plenty of vehicle were lined up for shipment today: China\u2019s latest wave of tariffs haven\u2019t spooked the US stock market. The Dow Jones industrial average has dipped by 24 points, or just 0.1%, while the broader S&amp;P 500 index is flat. David Madden of CMC Markets explains why traders aren\u2019t panicking: Markets had a muted reaction to China\u2019s announcement that it plans to impose tariffs on $16 billion worth of US goods, starting on 23 August. The token retaliation from Beijing keeps the trade spat alive, and it seems like China were doing it to send a message, rather than to inflict financial pain on the US. So far, China has managed a tit-for-tat response to America\u2019s trade tariffs -- including today\u2019s retaliation to US plans for tariffs on $16bn of Chinese goods. But Beijing can\u2019t respond in kind if Donald Trump implements his threat for 25% tariffs on an extra $200bn of goods, simply because China doesn\u2019t buy enough from America. Oliver Jones of Capital Economics thinks Beijing might change course, and target individual US companies. He writes: While China has so far responded to US tariffs primarily with duties of its own, it is reaching the limit of its ability to respond in this way. There are already signs that China is starting to target US multinationals operating there directly instead. We think that its response will increasingly take this form if the US imposes tariffs beyond those already in the pipeline. Here\u2019s Reuters\u2019 take on the US-China tariffs row: China is slapping additional import tariffs of 25 percent on $16 billion worth of U.S. goods ranging from oil and steel products to autos and medical equipment, the commerce ministry said, as the world\u2019s two largest economies escalate their trade dispute. \u201cThis is a very unreasonable practice,\u201d the commerce ministry said on its website http://www.mofcom.gov.cn, responding to the United States\u2019 decision to slap 25 percent tariffs on another $16 billion of Chinese goods on Aug 23. The slump in sterling today has given the London stock exchange a boost. The FTSE 100 has gained 43 points, or 0.5%, to 7761 points. With the pound lower, multinational\u2019s overseas earnings are worth more in sterling terms (updated). Basically the Footsie is acting as the \u2018up\u2019 side of the see-saw, as the pound drops - currently down 0.5% against the US dollar to around $1.287. Tesla\u2019s shares have dipped in early trading, down $2.5 at around $377. Wall Street may not be convinced that the company is definitely being taken private, following that announcement from the company\u2019s board. After all, \u201ctaking the appropriate next steps\u201d is rater more guarded than Musk\u2019s bold claim that he has \u201cfunding secured\u201d to take Tesla off the stock market at $420 per share. Newsflash: Electric car maker Tesla has issued a statement, in response to founder Elon Musk\u2019s comments yesterday about taking the company off the stock market. Tesla says that Musk \u201copened discussions\u201d last week with the company\u2019s board about taking it private, to \u201cbetter serve\u201d its long-term interests. The board have met several times since, and are now evaluating the idea. Yesterday, Musk insisted that he had secured the funding to take Tesla private - even though it would be the biggest buyout ever. Leaving the stock market would take some pressure off Tesla, as it battles to hit its production targets... However, some financial analysts are sceptical that the plan would really work: American scrap metal and waste paper will also incur 25% tariffs at the Chinese border in two weeks. So, apparently, will US \u201cfish meal for feed\u201d (which I think is used to nourish farmed fish, poultry and pork). China\u2019s new retaliatory tariffs will apply to 333 US products. Coal, diesel, cars and bicycles, medical equipment and steel products are all on the list, the Chinese commerce department says. Newsflash: China has announced it will impose retaliatory 25% tariffs on $16bn of US goods. Beijing\u2019s commerce ministry says it has been forced to retaliate to America\u2019s \u201cvery unreasonable\u201d levies on $16bn of Chinese exports (announced last night). China\u2019s measures will kick-in on August 23, the same day as America\u2019s latest levies, as it sticks to its policy of respond in kind to Donald Trump\u2019s trade moves. So in two weeks, the two countries will be imposing tariffs on $50bn of each others goods. American officials are already working on plans for tariffs on another $200bn of Chinese products in September. Reuters reports that City traders are taking steps to protect themselves against sterling falling further: Nine-month and one-year sterling/dollar risk-reversals fell on Wednesday to the lowest since early-March 2017, as investors rushed to protect themselves from further weakness in the British currency. Risk reversals are a gauge of investor expectations for a currency\u2019s direction and are used to hedge against expected moves. The fall in sterling risk reversals indicates greater demand for put options, derivatives that give investors the right to sell an asset. This is from Miles Eakers of foreign exchange firm Centtrip: Sterling is being hit by fears of a \u2018no-deal Brexit\u2019, says Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at FXTM. Sterling was pounded by the Dollar and most of its major counterparts on Wednesday as fears heightened over the UK exiting the European Union without a trade deal in place. Concerns of a potential hard Brexit scenario have haunted investor attraction towards the Pound and have left the currency vulnerable to downside shocks. The selloff is gathering pace. Here\u2019s the latest damage: Pound vs US dollar: $1.286, an 11-month low Pound vs euro: \u20ac1.109, a nine-month low Economics lecturer Daniel McLaughlin says the slide in the pound is bad news for UK consumers: [It\u2019s true that a weaker currency makes exports more competitive, but it also makes imported raw materials pricier - so it\u2019s not an undiluted win] Newsflash: The euro has risen over 90p against the pound for the first time since last autumn. Jordan Rochester of Japanese bank Nomura predicts the pound will keep falling ahead of the next crunch EU summit in October - when Theresa May will try to persuade leaders to back her \u2018Chequers\u2019 deal. \u201cWe remain bearish on the pound in the short term until the Brexit mess is out the way and look for the currency to enter a $1.27-1.28 range before the leaders summit.\u201d Ouch! The pound just fell through $1.29 for the first time since August 2017. UK holidaymakers heading to Europe this summer just suffered a blow. The pound has weakened against the euro to its lowest level since last November, meaning trips across the channel have become a little more expensive. Sterling fell as low as \u20ac1.1129, down 0.25% today. But that\u2019s not all! Sterling has dropped to a new 11-month low against the US dollar, at $1.2909, and is also weaker against the yen and the Swiss franc. The pound has been under pressure this week, after trade secretary Liam Fox claimed that Britain was likely to leave the EU without a deal. Such a hard-Brexit could lead to chaos at the borders, and leave companies struggling to keep their supply chains running Christophe Barraud, an economist at Market Securities brokerage in Paris, has told Reuters that firms are trying to protect themselves from a sterling crisis. \u201cA lot of companies can\u2019t wait for the negotiations outcome in October so a lot of course are trying to hedge against a drop in the pound.\u201d ANZ senior China economist Betty Wang agrees that Chinese factories have benefitted from the weaker yuan - even if Beijing hasn\u2019t been fighting a currency war. She says: \u201cCurrency devaluation, which may have helped exports to some extent, has been largely market-driven in our view and is not a preferred policy tool by Chinese policy makers as part of the retaliation measures.\u201d Figures released earlier this week showed that Beijing hasn\u2019t been burning through its foreign exchange reserves, suggesting it has been allowing the yuan to drop rather than fighting it: China\u2019s stock market suffered losses today, after America finalised its plans for tariffs on another $16bn of exports. The Shanghai composite index fell by 1.2%, as traders worried that the trade war keeps ratcheting up. Washington might be disappointed to see that China\u2019s imports and exports actually rose in July, says Michael Hewson of CMC Markets: If the US was hoping that its $34bn opening salvo of tariffs would have an effect on Chinese exports this morning\u2019s China trade numbers would have been a disappointment to them. Chinese exports for July saw a rise of 12.2% up from 11.2% in June, supporting the premise that for the moment we seem to be in a bit of a phoney war. We also saw a big rise in imports of 27.3% showing that domestic demand remains quite strong. China\u2019s trade surplus with America remained close to a record high in July, despite the trade dispute. Reuters explains: China\u2019s closely watched surplus with the United States dipped only slightly to $28.09 billion last month from a record $28.97 billion in June. Washington has long criticised China\u2019s trade surplus with the United States and has demanded Beijing cut it. Still, disagreements between the two major economic powers run deeper than just the trade balance and tensions remain over market access, intellectual property, technology transfer and investment. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. America has fired another shot in the deepening trade dispute with China. Overnight, Washington said it would impose a 25% tariff on $16bn of Chinese imports, taking the total amount being targeted to $50bn. The new levy will come into force on August 23rd, and will apply to 279 product types. It mostly affects industrial products, such as machinery, chemicals and semiconductors. Motorcycles and railway cars also feature. Announcing the move, the US trade representative declared that America was penalising China for stealing its intellectual property, saying: China directs and unfairly facilitates the systematic investment in, and acquisition of, U.S. companies and assets to generate large-scale technology transfer\u201d. China is likely to retaliate soon, escalating the dispute that has been rumbling for weeks. But... China may not be suffering from the trade war yet. Data released this morning shows that the country\u2019s exports jumped 12.2% year-on-year in July, beating expectations. Imports surged by a sparkling 27.3% - meaning China\u2019s trade surplus shrank during the month to $28bn (from over $41bn in June). This is significant, as America\u2019s first wave of tariffs (on $34bn of Chinese goods) began in early July. Those tariffs have been blamed for a drop in German factory orders, but today\u2019s figures suggest China\u2019s economy is holding firm. Of course, it\u2019s still early days. Global trade, like the massive container ships it relies on, changes course slowly. Plus, China\u2019s manufacturers may be benefitting from the country\u2019s weaker currency, given the yuan has fallen pretty steadily recently to a 13-month low. Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist for Capital Economics, explains: Adjusting for seasonality and price effects, we estimate that export volumes were essentially flat in July. Shipments to the US did weaken slightly, which suggests the tariffs had some impact. But this was offset by stronger exports to the rest of the world, most likely buoyed by the weaker renminbi. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets agrees that China\u2019s trade data is encouraging, especially in the current climate. China trade data showed stronger growth in both exports and imports, notably the latter, suggesting strong consumption both domestically and internationally. But Also coming up today... Wall Street will be watching for Elon Musk\u2019s next move, after the inventor/entrepreneur surprisingly announced he plans to take Tesla private. Shares in the electric carmaker surged last night, burning sceptical investors who had bet against the company. Going private would take some pressure off Tesla to meet financial targets (and prevent Musk having another row with the analyst community) However, shares aren\u2019t at the $420 level which Musk pitched his somewhat vague offer at (which has sparked grumbling about market manipulation), so Tesla\u2019s future remains uncertain. Oil is calm this morning, having risen yesterday after the US issued new sanctions on Iran. Later today we get the latest American oil inventory figures, which may show a drop in stocks.

      "bodyText": "Homebase is preparing to announce the closure of up to 80 stores next week, with the probable loss of about 1,000 jobs. The loss-making DIY chain, which was bought by the restructuring experts Hilco in a deal agreed in May, is expected to file a company voluntary arrangement (CVA), a form of insolvency that enables a retailer to exit or alter deals with landlords. The process is expected to be handled by Alvarez &amp; Marsal, a specialist adviser on corporate insolvencies that advised Toys R Us on a CVA before the it collapsed this year. The company has already shut 17 unprofitable stores and confirmed plans to close at least 23 more. Industry insiders said the 23 would be part of a CVA involving between 60 and 80 stores in total. Homebase was bought by Hilco, the owner of HMV, for \u00a31 in a deal agreed in May after its previous Australian owner, Wesfarmers, pulled the plug on its UK venture. The botched Australian acquisition of Homebase is considered one of the most disastrous retail takeovers, alongside Tesco\u2019s doomed expansion into the US with its Fresh &amp; Easy grocery chain. Wesfarmers, which bought the business for \u00a3340m two years ago, offloaded the entire Homebase chain of 250 stores, with a workforce of just over 11,000 people, ditching a plan to convert them to its Bunnings brand. On top of Wesfarmers\u2019 catalogue of errors, Homebase is battling to survive in a tough DIY sector hit by a slowdown in the housing market and a squeeze on consumer spending. In May, the B&amp;Q owner, Kingfisher, blamed \u201csoft demand\u201d amid harsh spring weather for a 9% fall in sales in the three months to the end of April, while Travis Perkins, the owner of Wickes, is reviewing whether to offload the DIY chain, where sales and profits are falling. Traditional chains are also under pressure from online specialists such as Victoria Plum and of discount stores such as Home Bargains, B&amp;M Stores and Aldi, which sells tools, wallpaper and gardening accessories in its bargain aisles. Since the rescue by Hilco, Homebase has cut 300 jobs at its Milton Keynes head office and horticultural buying office in Swindon. Several of the 24 stores that had been converted to Bunnings outlets, including those in Folkestone and Frome, have been switched back to the Homebase brand. At least four other major retail chains \u2013 House of Fraser, New Look, Carpetright and Mothercare \u2013 turned to CVAs to jettison unwanted outlets this year. Restaurant groups such as Carluccio\u2019s, the Prezzo group, Byron and Jamie\u2019s Italian have done the same. Landlords have expressed anger at the growing use of CVAs, with the British Property Federation calling for an urgent government review, saying the process is being misused. Melanie Leech, the chief executive of the BPF, said: \u201cCVAs should not be entered into lightly as they impact jobs, local communities and property owners and the pensioners\u2019 savings that they invest. We advise any insolvency practitioner, representing a business seeking to enter into a CVA, to engage in confidence with the British Property Federation\u2019s insolvency committee as early as possible in the process. Homebase\u2019s team has not yet done this, but this best practice would allow for constructive engagement, to aim to ensure greater transparency and fairness.\u201d A group of landlords also launched a legal challenge against House of Fraser\u2019s CVA but settled out of court at the weekend. The department store is in last-ditch talks about refinancing with a number of parties after C.banner, the Chinese owner of Hamleys, withdrew plans to invest \u00a370m in the business. The group is expected to fall into administration as it struggles to fund payments to suppliers and rent bills due in coming weeks. House of Fraser in last-ditch talks Frasers in Edinburgh will be the first of 31 House of Fraser stores to close after the landlord agreed to take back the keys next month. The ailing department store chain is in last-ditch rescue talks after C.banner, the Chinese owner of Hamleys, withdrew plans to invest \u00a370m as part of a restructure involving the closure of 31 of House of Fraser\u2019s 59 stores. The group is facing administration as it struggles to fund pay suppliers and rent due in coming weeks. The 71,500sq ft store on Princes Street, which House of Fraser took over in 1953, is expected to be redeveloped as a hotel or offices. Landlord Parabola, which recently bought the site for more than \u00a313.5m, is also behind the Edinburgh Park development that includes offices, homes and a park. The Princes Street site has been occupied by a department store since 1894 when Robert Maule &amp; Sons converted a building which began life as the Osborne Hotel. H Binns &amp; Son demolished the original building in 1931, creating the store that exists today.",

      "bodyText": "A shipment of soya beans worth more than $20m (\u00a315.5m) has been bobbing aimlessly in the Pacific Ocean for a month, a casualty of the escalating trade war between China and the US. Lingering uncertainty over the cargo\u2019s fate offered a timely reminder of the fallout from a dispute that intensified on Wednesday, as the US president, Donald Trump, unveiled a second round of tariffs on $16bn of Chinese goods, prompting Beijing to respond in kind. The Peak Pegasus, a 229 metre bulk carrier weighing 43,000 tonnes, has become the reluctant symbol of the potential consequences of this tit-for-tat trade spat. The ship, owned by JP Morgan Asset Management, was scheduled to unload about 70,000 tonnes of American soya beans in the Chinese port of Dalian on 6 July, shortly after Trump imposed a first round of tariffs on $34bn-worth of goods. As it rushed to shore in the hope of clearing customs before Beijing imposed retaliatory tariffs, the ship \u2013 and its protein-rich cargo \u2013 became an unlikely internet sensation on the Chinese social media platform Weibo. However, the vessel arrived just too late and has been sailing around in circles ever since while the cargo\u2019s owners, understood to be the agricultural commodity trading house Louis Dreyfus, decide what to do. The Amsterdam-based company is thought to be paying about $12,500 a day to continue chartering the ship, which is idling in the Yellow Sea off the coast of China, indicating extra costs so far of more than $400,000. Commodities experts said it could still make financial sense to keep the beans at sea, potentially for months, given the risk of making the wrong decision about what do next. The market price of US soya beans has slumped since the trade war began as firms from China, the world\u2019s largest importer, sought alternative sources. That means potential alternative buyers for Louis Dreyfus\u2019s soya beans in Europe or elsewhere would probably demand a discount on what they would have sold for originally. Offloading them in China would incur a 25% tariff, adding around $6m to the cost of bringing them into the country. \u201cThey [the cargo\u2019s owners] have clearly got in mind the 25% tariff to take the goods into China and they\u2019ll be weighing that against alternative buyers asking for a massive discount potentially equivalent to that,\u201d said Michael Magdovitz, an analyst at Rabobank. \u201cThey\u2019d also have to pay an exorbitant price to divert the vessel from China to another destination.\u201d Soya beans are crucial for the production of cooking oil, biodiesel and meal used to feed livestock, including pigs reared to satisfy China\u2019s appetite for pork. One factor complicating the fate of the soya beans is uncertainty about the length of time that China can realistically switch to Brazilian soya beans as an alternative. \u201cThe problem for the Chinese is that Brazil quickly runs out of soybeans around this time of year,\u201d said Magdovitz. \u201cIt can\u2019t be the only source for China.\u201d China accelerated imports before the tariffs came into force in order to build stocks and hold off paying the tax. Magdovitz said the Peak Pegasus \u2013 and another soya bean-laden ship called the Star Jennifer that has also been idling offshore for a fortnight \u2013 could be waiting in the hope that China decides to subsidise soya bean importers. That could render US imports affordable again, allowing the resumption of a soya bean trade worth $12.7bn a year. Beijing blamed Trump for the escalation in the trade war as it announced 25% tariffs on another 333 separate US products from 23 August. \u201cThis is a very unreasonable practice,\u201d China\u2019s commerce ministry said in response to Washington\u2019s decision to target the additional $16bn of imports. China said it would retaliate with 25% tariffs of its own on an equivalent amount of American imports, including steel, fuel, cars and medical products. China and the US imposed tariffs on $34bn of each other\u2019s goods in June and the latest move underlined Beijing\u2019s determination to match protectionist measures like for like. Shares on Wall Street opened slightly lower as fears that Trump will now make good on his threat to target a further $200bn of Chinese goods dented investor confidence. The ratings agency S&amp;P has expressed concerns that the trade war could spill over into services because China is running out of American goods to hit with tariffs. The first Chinese trade figures since the imposition of the first round of US tariffs in early July showed that the country\u2019s annual export growth edged up from 11.2% to 12.2% last month when measured in dollar terms.

      "bodyText": "Congratulations, then, to the founders of Fever-Tree tonic, who are celebrating a \u00a3103.5m payout after selling stock to excitable investors. In July, Quartz reported that Fever-Tree\u2019s share price has done better than any other UK public company since 2015. Was there ever a fact that captured the absurdities of late capitalism better? Britain\u2019s current best-performing business sells a tonic slightly fancier than the many other available tonics, using what the company calls \u201cthe purest quinine in the world\u201d. Be gone, engineering companies and textile manufacturers! We have no need for you in this brave new world. What a pointless era we live in: where even getting pissed can be artisanal, where clipping one\u2019s toenails can be done with a boutique pair of scissors crafted by \u201csome of the world\u2019s most talented, curious and courageous designers\u201d, or where you can use wifi to make fresh orange juice. And how odd it is to see these examples of laconic decadence illuminated against our current political background of imminent climate crisis, political instability and the rise of the far right. How have these inane products retained their popularity in a world of unrelenting doom and gloom? Perhaps we\u2019re trying to rise above the misery in any way we can; perhaps they are all a relic from a bygone era when it seemed that things could only get better; or perhaps this is us putting on our best ermine and pearls, ready to go down with the Titanic. It would be be interesting to know what future historians will make of it all, if it\u2019s not too quaint to suppose that there will still be such a thing as historians in 100 years\u2019 time. At least tonic is primarily used as a mixer, so we know Britons are getting through the political turmoil the only way they know how \u2013 with alcohol. And though the Fever-Tree founders say the brand is named after the tree that produces quinine, I like to think of it as their ironic nod to the infernal wildfires that are currently sweeping the globe.

In July, <a href=\"https://qz.com/1342401/the-best-performing-stock-in-the-uk-makes-artisanal-tonic-water/\">Quartz</a> reported that Fever-Tree\u2019s share price has done better than any other UK public company since 2015.</p> <p>Was there ever a fact that captured the absurdities of late capitalism better? <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jul/24/fever-trees-value-gin-sales-shares\">Britain\u2019s current best-performing business</a> sells a tonic slightly fancier than the many other available tonics, using what the company calls \u201cthe purest quinine in the world\u201d. Be gone, engineering companies and textile manufacturers! We have no need for you in this brave new world.</p> <p>What a pointless era we live in: where even getting pissed can be artisanal, where clipping one\u2019s toenails can be done with a <a href=\"https://hay.dk/en-gb/hay/accessories-8b1762fc/decoration/scissor-b2b/delicate-scissors\">boutique pair of scissors</a> crafted by \u201csome of the world\u2019s most talented, curious and courageous designers\u201d, or where <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/19/15357340/juicero-juicer-not-actually-necessary-for-juicing\">you can use wifi to make fresh orange juice</a>. And how odd it is to see these examples of laconic decadence illuminated against our current political background of imminent climate crisis, political instability and the rise of the far right.</p> <p>How have these inane products retained their popularity in a world of unrelenting doom and gloom? Perhaps we\u2019re trying to rise above the misery in any way we can; perhaps they are all a relic from a bygone era when it seemed that things could only get better; or perhaps this is us putting on our best ermine and pearls, ready to go down with the Titanic. It would be be interesting to know what future historians will make of it all, if it\u2019s not too quaint to suppose that there will still be such a thing as historians in 100 years\u2019 time.</p> <p>At least tonic is primarily used as a mixer, so we know Britons are getting through the political turmoil the only way they know how \u2013 with alcohol. And though the Fever-Tree founders say the brand is named after the tree that produces quinine, I like to think of it as their ironic nod to the infernal wildfires that are currently sweeping the globe. Chin chin.</p>",

      "bodyText": "British Gas is adding \u00a344 to the typical fuel bill for 3.5 million customers in the second increase this year. Britain\u2019s biggest energy supplier blamed rising wholesale energy prices for the 3.8% rise in its standard variable tariff. It is the company\u2019s second bill increase in 2018, less than four months following a 5.5% rise announced on 10 April. From 1 October a typical dual fuel customer will pay \u00a31,205 a year \u2013 \u00a3104 more than before the first increase took effect on 29 May. British Gas\u2019s owner, Centrica, said in July it was considering a further price increase after wholesale prices rose and competitors put up their rates. Announcing the second increase, Centrica said the cost of buying energy in the wholesale market had risen by 20% since April. Mark Hodges, the chief executive of Centrica\u2019s consumer business, said: \u201cWe have today reluctantly announced plans for an increase in our standard variable tariff. We understand that any price increase adds extra pressure on customers\u2019 household bills. However, this reflects the sharp rise in wholesale energy costs.\u201d The increase will put further pressure on household budgets squeezed by wages, which have barely kept pace with inflation. In the three months to May, wage growth slowed to 2.5%, the lowest for six months, while inflation stands at 2.4%. Campaigners and politicians, including the energy minister, Claire Perry, had criticised the increase announced in April. Guy Anker, the deputy editor of MoneySavingExpert.com, said British Gas customers on the standard tariff should shop around for cheaper deals. Anker said: \u201cMillions will rightly be furious with British Gas when they hear of yet another price hike. But its customers need to turn that anger into action.\u201d British Gas lost 341,000 customer accounts in the first half of 2018. It withdrew the standard tariff from new customers in March and put customers at the end of their deals on 12-month temporary tariffs. That will cost \u00a31,180 from 1 October. The company said it wanted customers to switch from the standard tariff and it expected 3 million to be on the standard tariff at the end of 2018, down from 4.3 million at the start of the year.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Oprah effect has continued to work its magic for Weight Watchers, with the company reporting 1 million more members in a year and revenue up by one-fifth. Weight Watchers\u2019 shares are worth more than 13 times their value three years ago \u2013 shortly before Oprah Winfrey bought 10% of the company and agreed to be its ambassador. The increase is probably the biggest example of the Oprah effect \u2013 the former talkshow host and media mogul\u2019s power to boost sales of any product she supports. It is a transformation that has made Winfrey, already worth about $3bn (\u00a32.3bn), another fortune. Her stake, bought for $43m, had risen to more than $400m even after she sold one-quarter of her shares in March. In January 2015, Weight Watchers was in the doldrums and its management could not understand why. It was the new year and Americans were meant to be signing up to beat the flab. But nothing happened. Membership of the company, founded more than 50 years earlier, had been falling for a year even as obesity in the US was rising to record levels. What was wrong? It turned out US consumers had lost faith in diets \u2013 and companies dictating what they should weigh. Instead, consumers wanted wellbeing, which could include losing weight but also exercise and strength, both physical and mental. Weight Watchers replaced target weights with a broader healthy living plan, including exercise and supported by more emphasis on cognitive thinking. It also updated its apps and social media to help members improve their general health. Fitness tracking devices now offer FitPoints for activities such as walking, cleaning or dancing, which are used to calculate diet guidance. Not for the first time, the company contacted Winfrey, whose fluctuating weight was part of the personal story that had made Americans take her to their hearts. Winfrey had rebuffed earlier approaches, but in 2015, she agreed to promote the company, buying its shares and joining the board. The combination of tuning into consumers\u2019 needs and nabbing the ultimate brand ambassador transformed Weight Watchers\u2019 fortunes. The company piled on members and revenue soared. On Monday night, Weight Watchers posted results showing a 28% rise in member numbers from a year earlier, to 4.5 million, and total revenue up 20% to $409.7m. The UK is Weight Watchers\u2019 second-biggest market after North America, but it is growing at about half the pace of the wider group. UK revenue rose 10.5% to $29.2m in the second quarter, and the number of members increased by 15.2% to 383,500. The British business has no celebrity ambassadors since the MasterChef presenter Gregg Wallace stepped aside. For the past year, the company\u2019s growth has been led by its chief executive, Mindy Grossman, who had turned around the Home Shopping TV channel. The New York Times billed Grossman as the second coming of Jean Nidetch, the Brooklyn-born entrepreneur who founded Weight Watchers in the early 1960s. Last year, Grossman acknowledged Winfrey\u2019s effect on the company, but said its renewed success was also down to getting things right for its customers. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at the future of experiences and how you personalise it. We can inspire people to have healthy habits ... That\u2019s not just about losing 10lbs, but creating a structure you can live within,\u201d she said. Presenting the results this week, Grossman said Weight Watchers wanted to reach beyond its middle-aged female base to target men. The company has enlisted the producer DJ Khaled and the comedian Kevin Smith, who lost weight after a heart attack, as ambassadors in the US. Grossman also highlighted the company\u2019s success in encouraging members to recommend a friend on their app \u2013 with a 70% conversion rate. However, the results disappointed some investors. Though member numbers were up from a year earlier, they had fallen by 100,000 since the end of March. Revenue also fell short of analysts\u2019 average forecast, though net income, up from $45.1m to $70.7m, beat expectations. The shares, which had quadrupled in the previous year, were down 14% in early trading on Tuesday. Alessandro Giudici, a lecturer in management at Cass Business School, said: \u201cThey have been doing very well over the last couple of years. The turnaround is thanks to Oprah and the new strategy is delivering. But early this year, we started to see mixed signals because Oprah sold 25% of her shares, and there are question marks over their growth strategy.\u201d Giudici said attempts to attract men and younger, more affluent female customers could fall flat or even backfire. \u201cThey have been positioned very strongly in serving mass market customers above the age of 35 and Oprah is the right influencer for that market,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are now using influencers to try to tap into this new generation, but they need to keep focused on the mass market. There may be a trade-off. It remains to be seen.\u201d",
