      "bodyText": "The Bombardier train factory teetered on the brink of closure in 2011, when it lost a key contract for British carriages to Germany. The Derby site survived, but the debate over protecting high-value domestic jobs from foreign competition rumbles on, especially with Brexit on the way. Memories of the Bombardier furore are still fresh at the Department for Transport, it seems, because the latest ministerial incumbent appears determined to ensure that manufacturing work stays within these shores. Transport secretary Chris Grayling is taking advantage of the government\u2019s apprenticeship drive to keep jobs in the UK, rather than with EU manufacturing rivals like Germany, ahead of Brexit. January\u2019s industrial strategy called on all construction, infrastructure and capital investment projects worth \u00a310m-plus to take into account apprenticeships and skills development as part of tender evaluation. Sources close to Grayling say he believes this emphasis on apprentices can be used to help British firms win major domestic transport contracts or, at least, make sure overseas groups build the infrastructure and vehicles in the UK. Strict EU procurement guidelines create a level playing field that has helped overseas groups win UK transport projects, often to the detriment of UK industry. Infamously, Bombardier announced 1,400 job cuts at what was then the UK\u2019s last remaining train manufacturing plant after Krefeld-based Siemens won a \u00a33bn deal to build 1,200 carriages for the trans-London Thameslink route in 2011. Eurosceptics, and even EU-supportive unions, have complained for years that the EU rules \u2013 or Ojeu rules, named after the journal that contract bids are printed in \u2013 do not take into account practical domestic advantages to promote its agenda of borderless competition. The UK has typically adhered to Ojeu rules more closely than other members, but the procurement contracts are free to stipulate that local skills must be improved as a result of a contract award. Grayling is said to be basing his drive on Crossrail, the \u00a315bn east-to-west London rail route now known as the Elizabeth Line. This has used the procurement process to create hundreds of apprenticeships and enrol thousands of people into a tunnelling academy in Ilford, east London. Adopting this model would boost skills in an industry that is likely to struggle post-Brexit, given it is reliant on eastern European labour, while also making sure government spending remains in the UK. A DfT source tells the Observer: \u201cEvery major procurement contract has got to leave a skills footprint in the UK, so you have to have apprenticeships. It\u2019s a way of leveraging [transport] jobs into the UK: a German company that wins a job is unlikely to fly lots of British apprentices for training in Frankfurt.\u201d Richard Threlfall, head of infrastructure building and construction at KPMG, adds: \u201cThis is a neat way of meeting two objectives: to get the transport industry to invest more in the training and development of its staff and to drive up the value of contracts within the UK.\u201d A third rail source says: \u201cThis makes a stack of sense \u2013 for every \u2018x\u2019 number of pounds on a contract, there should be a British apprentice created.\u201d However, critics believe this goes against the spirit of EU competitiveness. A senior infrastructure figure says: \u201cThis plays fast and loose with Ojeu, it\u2019s a lot of sleight of hand. Overseas companies will be a lot more careful before deciding whether they should bid for British contracts.\u201d Sources say Grayling is looking to go further than the business department\u2019s industrial strategy, but that document made clear that it wants major projects to focus on developing the UK\u2019s waning construction-related skills. Amanda Clack, the president of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, warned last year that the UK is \u201cin the grip of our worst construction skills crisis in almost 20 years\u201d. The industry fears these problems will be worsened by Brexit, given it filled labour shortages after the EU expanded in 2004, but Leave supporters, and even the likes of Remain-voting former business secretary Vince Cable, believe secession can be used to develop skills. A DfT spokeswoman said the industrial strategy aimed to boost apprenticeships, but otherwise declined to comment. Nonetheless, Brexit could have a silver lining for future manufacturing professionals.",

      "bodyText": "Europe\u2019s busiest heliport, which ferries offshore oil workers between north-east Scotland and North Sea rigs, is normally one of the most active parts of Aberdeen. But the oil industry\u2019s two-year slump and thousands of job losses mean some residents say the food banks are the now the busiest place in the \u201cenergy capital of Europe\u201d. The oil price crash \u2013 from more than $100 a barrel when the Scottish independence referendum was held in 2014 to as low as $27 last year \u2013 has been tough on the Granite City. \u201cAbsolutely Aberdeen has been through the wringer, you can see it \u2013 shops, restaurants and pubs closing, people out of jobs,\u201d says Deirdre Michie, chief executive of Oil &amp; Gas UK. The trade body\u2019s figures show numbers employed by the industry in the UK fell from 453,800 to 330,400 between 2014 and 2016. Scotland makes up 38% of the total workforce, and unemployment rates in Aberdeen went up by a quarter during the slump. Michie says the key positive difference between the last referendum and Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s \u201cindyref2\u201d, being voted on this week in Holyrood, is that oil companies have slashed costs. \u201cWe\u2019re more competitive, so as an industry, we\u2019re in a better place,\u201d says Michie, who speaks of a \u201ccautious optimism\u201d as oil prices have crept up to about $52 since major oil countries announced production curbs last December. Lower operating costs will be crucial if Scotland is to recover the UK\u2019s remaining oil and gas, of which it holds 88%, according to analysts. In 2014, then-Scottish National Party leader Alex Salmond put those hydrocarbons at the heart of his economic and fiscal case for independence. He claimed there was 24bn barrels of oil equivalent (boe) to be exploited, worth \u00a31.5tn to Scotland. Forecasts today suggest much less oil will be recovered, potentially undermining the financial case for independence. Oil analyst Wood Mackenzie says reserves have been downgraded partly because some fields have ceased production in the face of a lower oil price. Professor Alexander Kemp, an oil economist at the University of Aberdeen, says his research shows that with a $60 oil price, Scotland could produce around 11bn boe of reserves between now and 2050, leaving up to 7bn boe unused. \u201cThe challenge for the industry is to devise new technologies to make those [remaining reserves] economic, to make it up closer to the 20bn boe that some people talk about. At the moment, we\u2019re not going to make it,\u201d he says. Even with the oil price edging up in the past few months, unions say the modest oil industry recovery talked of globally is not being felt yet in Aberdeen. \u201cIt\u2019s not being seen on the ground at all; people are working under the ever-present threat of redundancies and pay cuts. I\u2019m representing a couple of guys today who are appealing against redundancies,\u201d says Jake Molloy, regional organiser for the RMT. In a city so dependent on the oil industry, the knock-on effects are widespread on the businesses that rely on it. Taxi drivers report trade halved in 2016; one says his usual 30-a-week trips to the airport, at \u00a320 each way, are down to five as a result of a lack of oil workers. \u201cIt\u2019s just gradually falling to bits,\u201d says Pete Morton, a barista at a coffee chain in the town centre. There are several empty shops and at least eight bookies up and down the length of Union Street, though locals are split on whether that\u2019s down to the oil crash or a reflection of wider retail changes seen elsewhere, too. Property prices are down, and there are stories of laid-off oil workers who can no longer afford big mortgages, but equally don\u2019t want to sell in a falling market. A straw poll suggests many here think the economic argument for independence is shot because of what\u2019s happened to the oil price. \u201cI think it affects it big-time,\u201d says retiree Phyllis Thomson. Campbell Monro, an electrician and former offshore contractor, says on the financial case for independence: \u201cIt\u2019s worse now.\u201d Others disagree. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot more to offer than just oil. I get Aberdeen is quite heavily based on that, but I don\u2019t think we just need to rely on that,\u201d says local resident Hannah Wilson. Jim Gifford, a Scottish Conservative councillor and former leader of Aberdeenshire county council, says: \u201cBusinesses were just getting past the first referendum and then came the oil crash: it was catastrophic. A second referendum is the worst possible thing. It\u2019s the uncertainty \u2013 businesses don\u2019t like uncertainty.\u201d At the town hall, where the barometer outside points to \u201cchange\u201d and the Queen\u2019s portrait hangs in the lobby inside, city council leader Jenny Laing says Aberdeen has experienced downturns before but \u201cnothing on this scale\u201d, and that the prospect of another referendum is disastrous. \u201cI was a campaigner for remaining [in 2014] because I didn\u2019t believe, even with the oil price at the height it was, that it was sensible economics to base the whole of your future on that one industry; we\u2019d seen the peaks and troughs before. Since the oil slump, I think it\u2019s clear those arguments were not sound,\u201d says the Scottish Labour councillor. Callum McCaig \u2013 the SNP MP who drew laughter from colleagues and a stony face from Theresa May at PMQs last week when he asked if the UK could afford to be an independent country given its debt \u2013 rejected the idea that the fiscal and economic case no longer adds up. \u201cIf we were a petrol state and our only economic activity dropped in value by 75%, we would have had an enormous recession, and we have not. The Scottish economy is not dependent on oil and gas,\u201d says the member for Aberdeen South. He argues that if Scotland had been independent during 2014-16, it would have handled the oil crisis better for the city. \u201cCompare the urgency with which ministers dealt with the steel crisis, or the haste with which Greg Clark went to France to discuss the future of Vauxhall, and compare that with the utter complacency in supporting our oil and gas industry,\u201d he says. Of the lower oil price\u2019s impact on another bid for independence, he admits \u201cI don\u2019t think it helps\u201d but says the way the slump was mishandled in Aberdeen by Westminster will help win over waverers (the city voted No last time). McCaig laughed at those who say even talk of another referendum is bringing more uncertainty and risks hurting the oil industry. Pointing to Brexit secretary David Davis telling MPs that the government has not assessed the impact of leaving the EU without a deal, he says: \u201cYou have complete uncertainty already. You cannot have more uncertainty.\u201d AFTER OIL: THE ECONOMIC OPTIONS The North Sea oil industry has been a cash cow for the UK Treasury since the early 1980s. Now that it is largely spent, both as a reservoir of flammable carbon and as a source of tax revenues, an independent Scotland would need to look elsewhere for growth. In the years since the oil price collapsed and the industry went into decline, Scotland\u2019s GDP growth has flatlined. In that time the UK\u2019s GDP growth has outstripped that of most of the developed world. That\u2019s a blow to Holyrood, which is struggling with a budget deficit nearing 10% before Nicola Sturgeon even thinks about the implications of leaving the UK. Such is the decline in oil revenues that whisky is now the country\u2019s biggest export, pushing professional services \u2013 much of them linked to Edinburgh\u2019s finance industry \u2013 into second place; oil is third and mining and quarrying fourth. Many SNP officials still look to Ireland as a role model: Dublin as a low-tax financial centre, Cork as a hi-tech hub and agriculture as the bedrock. But the Irish government is nervous about Brexit for the same reasons Scotland should be. Britain is the biggest destination for its exports, and the prospect of tariffs could persuade several industries to decamp almost entirely to the rest of the UK. Particularly at risk is the Scottish financial services industry, which does most of its business south of the border. Standard Life, which is about to merge with rival Aberdeen Asset Management to create an investment behemoth, said during the last referendum that it would probably move south, if only to continue as a dominant player in the UK pensions market. Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds are in a similar position. There is the prospect of European Union membership after Brexit, but that will be blocked for as long as Scotland\u2019s budget deficit is above 3%. So even if the Spanish, concerned about a good deal for Scotland encouraging Catalonia to split, agree to swap the UK for Scotland, it could be years before the EU27 becomes 28 again. Holyrood could try to gain access to the single market by joining Norway, Switzerland, Iceland and Liechtenstein in the European Free Trade Area. This requires a fee, which could be waived, and free movement of labour, which Holyrood favours. Efta would mean tariff-free access for Scottish exporters, which would support agriculture and fishing and could encourage English or Welsh firms that rely on EU access and are considering a shift to Ireland to shift their businesses north. At the moment, exports to the EU are small (just 16%) compared with the UK and US. There is a future away from oil. Scottish energy producers, many investing heavily in renewables, are increasingly selling electricity south of the border. But the transition will be painful. Phillip Inman",

There are several empty shops and at least eight bookies up and down the length of Union Street, though locals are split on whether that\u2019s down to the oil crash or a reflection of wider retail changes seen elsewhere, too. Property prices are down, and there are stories of laid-off oil workers who can no longer afford big mortgages, but equally don\u2019t want to sell in a falling market.</p> <p>A straw poll suggests many here think the economic argument for independence is shot because of what\u2019s happened to the oil price. \u201cI think it affects it big-time,\u201d says retiree Phyllis Thomson.</p> <p>Campbell Monro, an electrician and former offshore contractor, says on the financial case for independence: \u201cIt\u2019s worse now.\u201d</p> <p>Others disagree. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot more to offer than just oil. I get Aberdeen is quite heavily based on that, but I don\u2019t think we just need to rely on that,\u201d says local resident Hannah Wilson.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"17f29030a77421074d188d50f91ee8e70c1fbcf8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/17f29030a77421074d188d50f91ee8e70c1fbcf8/0_338_5050_3031/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Scotland\u2019s first minister Nicola Sturgeon\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Scotland\u2019s first minister Nicola Sturgeon is lobbying for a second referendum \u2013 and Aberdeen may vote yes this time.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo Macleod for the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Jim Gifford, a Scottish Conservative councillor and former leader of Aberdeenshire county council, says: \u201cBusinesses were just getting past the first referendum and then came the oil crash: it was catastrophic. A second referendum is the worst possible thing. It\u2019s the uncertainty \u2013 businesses don\u2019t like uncertainty.\u201d</p> <p>At the town hall, where the barometer outside points to \u201cchange\u201d and the Queen\u2019s portrait hangs in the lobby inside, city council leader Jenny Laing says Aberdeen has experienced downturns before but \u201cnothing on this scale\u201d, and that the prospect of another referendum is disastrous.</p> <p>\u201cI was a campaigner for remaining [in 2014] because I didn\u2019t believe, even with the oil price at the height it was, that it was sensible economics to base the whole of your future on that one industry; we\u2019d seen the peaks and troughs before. Since the oil slump, I think it\u2019s clear those arguments were not sound,\u201d says the Scottish Labour councillor.</p> <p>Callum McCaig \u2013 the SNP MP who drew laughter from colleagues and a stony face from Theresa May at PMQs last week <a href=\"http://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/snp-mp-asks-theresa-may-if-uk-can-afford-to-be-independent-1-4393010\">when he asked if the UK could afford to be an independent country given its deb</a>t \u2013 rejected the idea that the fiscal and economic case no longer adds up. </p> <p>\u201cIf we were a petrol state and our only economic activity dropped in value by 75%, we would have had an enormous recession, and we have not. The Scottish economy is not dependent on oil and gas,\u201d says the member for Aberdeen South. He argues that if Scotland had been independent during 2014-16, it would have handled the oil crisis better for the city.</p> <p>\u201cCompare the urgency with which ministers dealt with the steel crisis, or the haste with which Greg Clark went to France to discuss the future of Vauxhall, and compare that with the utter complacency in supporting our oil and gas industry,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Of the lower oil price\u2019s impact on another bid for independence, he admits \u201cI don\u2019t think it helps\u201d but says the way the slump was mishandled in Aberdeen by Westminster will help win over waverers (the city voted No last time).</p> <p>McCaig laughed at those who say even talk of another referendum is bringing more uncertainty and risks hurting the oil industry. Pointing to Brexit secretary David Davis <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/mar/15/brexit-government-assessed-impact-leaving-eu-deal-david-davis\">telling MPs</a> that the government has not assessed the impact of leaving the EU without a deal, he says: \u201cYou have complete uncertainty already. You cannot have more uncertainty.\u201d</p> <h2>AFTER OIL: THE ECONOMIC OPTIONS</h2> <p>The North Sea oil industry has been a cash cow for the UK Treasury since the early 1980s. Now that it is largely spent, both as a reservoir of flammable carbon and as a source of tax revenues, an independent Scotland would need to look elsewhere for growth.</p> <p>In the years since the oil price collapsed and the industry went into decline, Scotland\u2019s GDP growth has flatlined. In that time the UK\u2019s GDP growth has outstripped that of most of the developed world.</p> <p>That\u2019s a blow to Holyrood, which is struggling with a budget deficit nearing 10% before Nicola Sturgeon even thinks about the implications of leaving the UK.</p> <p>Such is the decline in oil revenues that whisky is now the country\u2019s biggest export, pushing professional services \u2013 much of them linked to Edinburgh\u2019s finance industry \u2013 into second place; oil is third and mining and quarrying fourth.</p> <p>Many SNP officials still look to Ireland as a role model: Dublin as a low-tax financial centre, Cork as a hi-tech hub and agriculture as the bedrock. But the Irish government is nervous about Brexit for the same reasons Scotland should be. Britain is the biggest destination for its exports, and the prospect of tariffs could persuade several industries to decamp almost entirely to the rest of the UK.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6fb47bb78bcac56b0bb205f942144920dcd9ce4c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6fb47bb78bcac56b0bb205f942144920dcd9ce4c/0_221_4256_2554/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Standard Life\u2019s HQ in Edinburgh\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Standard Life\u2019s HQ in Edinburgh</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andy Buchanan/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Particularly at risk is the Scottish financial services industry, which does most of its business south of the border. Standard Life, which is about to merge with rival Aberdeen Asset Management to create an investment behemoth, said during the last referendum that it would probably move south, if only to continue as a dominant player in the UK pensions market. Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds are in a similar position.</p> <p>There is the prospect of European Union membership after Brexit, but that will be blocked for as long as Scotland\u2019s budget deficit is above 3%. So even if the Spanish, concerned about a good deal for Scotland encouraging Catalonia to split, agree to swap the UK for Scotland, it could be years before the EU27 becomes 28 again.</p> <p>Holyrood could try to gain access to the single market by joining Norway, Switzerland, Iceland and Liechtenstein in the European Free Trade Area. This requires a fee, which could be waived, and free movement of labour, which Holyrood favours. Efta would mean tariff-free access for Scottish exporters, which would support agriculture and fishing and could encourage English or Welsh firms that rely on EU access and are considering a shift to Ireland to shift their businesses north. At the moment, exports to the EU are small (just 16%) compared with the UK and US.</p> <p>There is a future away from oil. Scottish energy producers, many investing heavily in renewables, are increasingly selling electricity south of the border. But the transition will be painful.<br><strong>Phillip Inman</strong></p>",

      "bodyText": "Rising food and fuel costs are expected to have pushed inflation to its highest level in more than three years when official figures are released on Tuesday, underscoring the impact of the Brexit-battered pound on prices in the shops. Economists predict that the data will show inflation, on the consumer prices index (CPI) measure, hitting 2.1% for February, up from 1.8% in January. If proven correct, this forecast, from a Reuters poll of economists, would see inflation at its highest level since November 2013, and above the Bank of England\u2019s government-set target of 2%. The sharp fall in the pound since the Brexit vote last summer has raised the price of imported goods such as fuels, metals and food ingredients. The pressure on import costs has sparked some high-profile price tussles between suppliers and retailers, such as the row over Marmite last year. Earlier this year, Apple said it was raising prices in its UK app store by almost 25% to reflect sterling\u2019s sharp depreciation. That currency effect has combined with a rise in global oil prices to push inflation higher in recent months, causing a rude awakening for consumers, who had enjoyed near-zero inflation throughout 2015 and the first half of 2016. Howard Archer of consultancy IHS Markit predicts that Tuesday\u2019s figures will confirm the rising trend for inflation: \u201cInflation is expected to have been lifted in February by significantly increased food prices. We expect consumer price inflation to trend markedly higher over the coming months, as sterling weakness increasingly feeds through, and overall higher oil and commodity prices impact. Additionally, several utility companies have announced electricity and/or gas price hikes in March and April.\u201d Philip Shaw of Investec is also expecting evidence of upward pressure on inflation from food as well as fuel. He sees a chance that fashion stores also got in on the price hikes in February, after cutting prices in January. \u201cClothing prices fell unexpectedly sharply last month, which may well herald a strong rebound this time,\u201d he says. Shaw and other economists are predicting that inflation will continue rising and go above 3% this year. Wage growth, meanwhile, has been slowing, so households are seeing their real \u2013 or inflation-adjusted \u2013 incomes deteriorate. That pattern prompted a leading thinktank to warn recently that workers are on course to suffer an unprecedented 15 years of lost earnings growth. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said average earnings would be no higher in 2022 than they were in 2007, and predicted that welfare cuts would compound the financial pain for many. Such forecasts bode ill for hopes that the UK economy can continue to show resilience in the face of Brexit-related uncertainty. Consumer spending, the main driver of growth, is expected to flag as incomes are squeezed. The rise in inflation will intensify the debate at the Bank of England over the right time to increase interest rates from their current record low of 0.25%. The Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee (MPC), under governor Mark Carney, has maintained that it is happy to let inflation rise some way above its target as it trades off the need to support growth and jobs with keeping price rises in check. But the minutes of its meeting last week suggested a split was emerging over how much inflation should be tolerated before taking borrowing costs higher again. One of the nine MPC policymakers, Kristin Forbes, voted for a rate rise at that meeting, while others indicated that it would not take much for them to join her. But economists are doubtful whether enough supporters would emerge for a rate hike any time soon. \u201cThe risks to the MPC\u2019s near-term forecast for output are probably skewed slightly to the downside, and there is a risk that uncertainty will build as article 50 is triggered and the EU negotiations get under way,\u201d say Paul Hollingsworth and Scott Bowman at consultancy Capital Economics. \u201cAs a result, we continue to think that the MPC will hold off until around the end of next year before raising interest rates.\u201d This week\u2019s inflation data will mark the first time the Office for National Statistics will have used a broader, but controversial, measure called CPIH, which is \u201cconsumer prices index including owner-occupiers\u2019 housing costs\u201d. Some economists say CPIH is lacking as a measure because by using figures based on \u201crent equivalence\u201d, it does not truthfully capture people\u2019s experience of the housing market. CPIH lost its status as a \u201cnational statistic\u201d in 2014 and has yet to regain it. Capital Economics thinks that CPIH rose to 2.2% in February, from 1.9% in January.",
