Investigative journalist Simon Bowers answered your questions<br></p>", 
      "body": "<p>Almost 28,000 pages of leaked tax documents show <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/nov/05/-sp-luxembourg-tax-files-tax-avoidance-industrial-scale\">how Luxembourg helped some of the world\u2019s largest corporations</a> \u2013 including drugs group <a href=\"http://preview.gutools.co.uk/business/shire\">Shire</a>, City trading firm ICAP and vacuum cleaner firm Dyson \u2013 save millions in tax, to the detriment of its neighbours and allies.</p> <p>Recent scrutiny of technology groups such as Apple, Google and Amazon put US digital firms at the vanguard of cross-border tax avoidance. But Wednesday\u2019s revelations show many European multinationals in non-digital industries also making extensive use of tax engineering. </p> <p>There is growing political pressure in the UK and abroad to stop companies exploiting international tax rules to slash their tax bills. David Cameron told business leaders at the World Economic Forum that he would not tolerate big multinationals avoiding tax. <br></p> <p>Chancellor George Osborne has pledged to reveal new measures next month to stop global corporations diverting profits offshore. Barack Obama has condemned tax avoiding companies as \u201cunpatriotic\u201d and the G20 group of nations is working on new rules to rein in aggressive tax planning.</p> <p>The pressure is already building on Luxembourg after the European Commission launched a formal investigation into whether Amazon\u2019s tax arrangements in the Grand Duchy amount to unfair state aid. The Luxembourg tax arrangements of Italian carmaker Fiat are also under official scrutiny by Brussels.</p> <p><strong>The investigation\u2019s lead reporter Simon Bowers answered readers questions about how he uncovered this story and what it means.</strong></p> <ul> <li>What are governments doing about tax engineering? </li> <li>What is the role of the UK\u2019s HMRC? </li> <li>This practice is not illegal, but what are the main ramifications? </li> </ul> <p>Add your questions in the comments below.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-comment\" data-canonical-url=\"http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/43277036\">  <div class=\"d2-comment-embedded\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Comment\"> <div class=\"d2-left-col\"> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/user/id/298497\" title=\"View SimonBowers\u2019s profile\"> <img class=\"d2-avatar\" src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/site_furniture/2010/09/01/no-user-image.gif\" height=\"40\" width=\"40\" alt=\"User avatar for SimonBowers\"> </a>  <span class=\"d2-badge d2-badge-staff d2-hidetext\" title=\"Guardian staff\" itemprop=\"jobTitle\">Guardian staff</span> </div> <div class=\"d2-right-col\"> <div itemscope itemprop=\"author\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> <a class=\"d2-username\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/user/id/298497\" title=\"View SimonBowers\u2019s profile\" itemprop=\"url\"> <span itemprop=\"givenName\">SimonBowers</span> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-permalink\"> <a class=\"d2-datetime\" href=\"http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/43277036\" title=\"Link to this comment\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">06 November 2014 1:03pm</a> </div>  <div class=\"d2-pick d2-hidetext\" title=\"This comment has been chosen by Guardian staff because it contributes to the debate\">This comment has been chosen by Guardian staff because it contributes to the debate</div> <div class=\"d2-body\" itemprop=\"text\"><p>Hi there, I'm Simon Bowers, investigative journalist for the Guardian.

We'll have to see how effective they are. I have a concern that many want to be seen to &quot;do something&quot;, but in reality don't risk pushing so hard they scare away foreign investment. This balancing act is overt in Switzerland where there is a series of reforms underway that are designed to allow Switzerland to escape international condemnation while remaining generous enough to keep a lot of multinationals' financing and intellectual property functions in the Alps. In the UK and Ireland you get a lot more double-talk, with politicians saying one thing to voters and another to big business.</p> <p>Will something really get done? I think the G20/OECD's reform programme - targeted as what is called Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) - looks very impressive and credible. Will it continue to enjoy political support? Will the lobbyist get it watered down? I don't know. Share prices of multinationals suggest investors don't see it as an immediate threat.</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-comment\" data-canonical-url=\"http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/43268983\">  <div class=\"d2-comment-embedded\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Comment\"> <div class=\"d2-left-col\"> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/user/id/13996977\" title=\"View OlmGuy2\u2019s profile\"> <img class=\"d2-avatar\" src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/site_furniture/2010/09/01/no-user-image.gif\" height=\"40\" width=\"40\" alt=\"User avatar for OlmGuy2\"> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-right-col\"> <div itemscope itemprop=\"author\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> <a class=\"d2-username\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/user/id/13996977\" title=\"View OlmGuy2\u2019s profile\" itemprop=\"url\"> <span itemprop=\"givenName\">OlmGuy2</span> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-permalink\"> <a class=\"d2-datetime\" href=\"http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/43268983\" title=\"Link to this comment\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">06 November 2014 10:20am</a> </div>  <div class=\"d2-pick d2-hidetext\" title=\"This comment has been chosen by Guardian staff because it contributes to the debate\">This comment has been chosen by Guardian staff because it contributes to the debate</div> <div class=\"d2-body\" itemprop=\"text\"><p>What about the Isle of Man and Channel Island tax breaks, plus I gather these two districts are NOT officially part of the European Union even though the UK basically controls them?

Instead you have a network of 3,000 or so bilateral tax treaties. Many are more or less similarly worded, following a template of a model tax treaty. This model treaty is the responsibility of the OECD, in Paris. <br />A quick bit of history: a century ago, big companies couldn't really trade well beyond their home borders cos they would be taxed in their overseas market, then taxed again when payments or profits returned home. <br />Bilateral tax treaties were designed to agree common ground between countries on how to fairly allocated taxing rights on income, ensuring it is not taxed twice. They're sometimes called double taxation treaties. And they opened up the possibility of world trade.<br />Now the OECD says the problem is not that poor multinationals are victims of double taxation. Rather they have found ways of using treaties, and slight differences between domestic tax rules in different countries, to create &quot;double non taxation&quot;. That's tax avoidance in plain English.</p> <p>A shorter answer might have been just to tell you there isn't really any international tax legislation.</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-comment\" data-canonical-url=\"http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/43264368\">  <div class=\"d2-comment-embedded\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Comment\"> <div class=\"d2-left-col\"> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/user/id/3294297\" title=\"View n1CKed\u2019s profile\"> <img class=\"d2-avatar\" src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/site_furniture/2010/09/01/no-user-image.gif\" height=\"40\" width=\"40\" alt=\"User avatar for n1CKed\"> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-right-col\"> <div itemscope itemprop=\"author\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> <a class=\"d2-username\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/user/id/3294297\" title=\"View n1CKed\u2019s profile\" itemprop=\"url\"> <span itemprop=\"givenName\">n1CKed</span> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-permalink\"> <a class=\"d2-datetime\" href=\"http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/43264368\" title=\"Link to this comment\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">06 November 2014 8:34am</a> </div>  <div class=\"d2-pick d2-hidetext\" title=\"This comment has been chosen by Guardian staff because it contributes to the debate\">This comment has been chosen by Guardian staff because it contributes to the debate</div> <div class=\"d2-body\" itemprop=\"text\"><p>Seems like the only consequences of these revelations will be &quot;embarrassment&quot;. <br />How likely is it that individuals face jail terms?

      "bodyText": "An unprecedented international investigation into tax deals struck with Luxembourg has uncovered the multi-billion dollar tax secrets of some of the world\u2019s largest multinational corporations. A cache of almost 28,000 pages of leaked tax agreements, returns and other sensitive papers relating to over 1,000 businesses paints a damning picture of an EU state which is quietly rubber-stamping tax avoidance on an industrial scale. The documents show that major companies \u2014 including drugs group Shire, City trading firm Icap and vacuum cleaner firm Dyson, who are headquartered in the UK or Ireland \u2014 have used complex webs of internal loans and interest payments which have slashed the companies\u2019 tax bills. These arrangements, signed off by the Grand Duchy, are perfectly legal. The documents also show how some 340 companies from around the world arranged specially-designed corporate structures with the Luxembourg authorities. The businesses include corporations such as Pepsi, Ikea, Accenture, Burberry, Procter &amp; Gamble, Heinz, JP Morgan and FedEx. Leaked papers relating to the Coach handbag firm, drugs group Abbott Laboratories, Amazon, Deutsche Bank and Australian financial group Macquarie are also included. A Guardian analysis has found: A Luxembourg unit of Shire, the FTSE-100 drug firm behind attention deficit pill Adderall, received more than $1.9bn in interest income from other group companies in the last five years, paying corporation tax of less than $2m over four of the years despite minimal overheads. Vacuum and hand dryer firm Dyson set up companies in the Isle of Man and Luxembourg to pour \u00a3300m of internal loans into its UK operations in 2011. Interest payments made on those loans slashed Dyson\u2019s UK tax bill and were instead taxed at only around 1% in Luxembourg, saving Dyson companies millions in tax. Icap, the financial trading firm run by leading Conservative party donor Michael Spencer, lent $870m from Luxembourg to its US business for seven years. Interest paid out from US companies on those loans was \u00a3247m, which was taxed at a fraction of official corporation tax rates in the US and UK. Stephen Shay, a Harvard Law School professor who has held senior tax roles in the US Treasury and who last year gave expert testimony on Apple\u2019s tax avoidance structures in a Senate investigation, said: \u201cClearly the database is evidencing a pervasive enabling by Luxembourg of multinationals\u2019 avoidance of taxes [around the world].\u201d He described the Grand Duchy as being \u201clike a magical fairyland.\u201d There is growing political pressure in the UK and abroad to stop companies exploiting international tax rules to slash their tax bills. In January last year David Cameron told business leaders gathered at the World Economic Forum in Davos he would not tolerate big multinationals avoiding tax. In particular, he criticised how \u201ccompanies navigate their way around legitimate tax systems ... with an army of clever accountants\u201d. Chancellor George Osborne has pledged to reveal new measures next month to stop global corporations diverting profits offshore. Barack Obama has condemned tax avoiding companies as \u201cunpatriotic\u201d and the G20 group of nations is working on new rules to rein in aggressive tax planning. The revelations will be embarrassing for the new president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, who was prime minister of Luxembourg between 1995 and 2013. In a speech in Brussels in July, Juncker promised to \u201ctry to put some morality, some ethics, into the European tax landscape.\u201d He has insisted that the country is not a tax haven. Pressure is already building on Luxembourg after the European Commission launched a formal investigation into whether Amazon\u2019s tax arrangements in the Grand Duchy amount to unfair state aid. The Luxembourg tax arrangements of Italian carmaker Fiat\u2019s finance unit are also under official scrutiny by Brussels. Asked recently if such a crackdown risked damaging the economy of Luxembourg, one senior figure closely involved in the G20 reform programme said: \u201cI don\u2019t care. It is like saying: \u2018If you fight drugs there will be no jobs in certain parts of Mexico.\u2019\u201d Recent scrutiny by politicians and media organisations of aggressive structures used by technology groups such as Apple, Google and Amazon have suggested US digital firms are at the vanguard of cross-border tax avoidance. But today\u2019s revelations show many European multinationals in non-digital industries have also made extensive use of tax engineering. More than 80 journalists in 26 countries, working in collaboration through the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, have spent six months scrutinising the leaked papers - after a small number of the documents were first revealed by French TV journalist Edouard Perrin. The papers largely relate to clients of PricewaterhouseCoopers Luxembourg. PwC is one of the largest tax advisory groups in the world. The leaked papers show Luxembourg acting as a go-between, both enabling and masking tax avoidance, which always takes place beyond its borders. The documents are mainly Advance Tax Agreements - known as comfort letters. The leaked papers include 548 of these private tax rulings. These ATAs are typically schemes put to the Luxembourg tax authorities which, if implemented, reduce tax bills substantially. If the Luxembourg authorities approve the scheme they provide a comfort letter which is a binding agreement. The EC\u2019s Amazon and Fiat investigations were launched after Brussels officials demanded that Luxembourg hand over certain ATAs. Less than a third of the tax deals brokered by PwC in the 28,000 pages of documents include a figure for the sums multinationals planned to move into Luxembourg schemes. However, these deals still amounted to more than $215bn of loans and investments using the Grand Duchy between 2002 and 2010, many to massage down tax bills. Given that many more leaked papers did not disclose sums involved, and that PwC was just one of several accounting firms which secure deals with the Luxembourg tax authorities, the full scale of financial flows through Luxembourg, facilitated by comfort letters from the Grand Duchy\u2019s officials, is likely to be much higher. PwC said questions put to it by ICIJ journalists were based on \u201coutdated\u201d and \u201cstolen\u201d information, \u201cthe theft of which is in the hands of the relevant authorities\u201d. But analysis of public filings with company registries around the world indicate many of the leaked tax deals remain in force, sapping tax revenues from public coffers today. The Guardian\u2019s detailed findings were put to Shire, Icap and Dyson. All three declined to answer questions. They issued statements saying that they do not engage in tax avoidance and that they pay tax in the countries where profits are made. Dyson stressed that its Isle of Man and Luxembourg structure was unwound in 2013. Icap said it had started a process of winding down its Luxembourg financing companies last month as part of a wider reorganisation. Many papers in the leaked tax correspondence do not reveal enough information to clearly show tax consequences of each group\u2019s corporate structuring. And some corporations will have sought comfort letters from Luxembourg for reasons other than tax avoidance. Many large private equity investments are also the subject of Luxembourg ATAs. Well known buyout firms such as Blackstone and Carlyle appear in the leaked documents, and Luxembourg investment vehicles are commonplace in such investment firms. A 2008 joint venture between private equity group Apax Partners and Guardian Media Group, which owns the Guardian, also used a Luxembourg structure after it invested in magazine and events group Emap, now called Top Right. A spokesman for GMG said: \u201cWe partnered with a private equity company which regularly used such structures. A Luxembourg entity was used because Apax already had that structure in place. The fact that the parent company is a Luxembourg company does not give rise to any UK corporation tax savings for GMG.\u201d How it works The documents reveal a number of financial structures which were approved by the Luxembourg tax authorities, and which led to substantial tax savings for the companies involved. One of the more common is based on cross-border lending within a group of companies, and a mismatch between the perceptions of Luxembourg and overseas tax authorities. How Shire\u2019s internal lending cuts its tax bill A tiny Luxembourg-based unit of Shire, a multinational drug firm specialising in treatments for ADHD, Crohn\u2019s disease and rare genetic disorders, has become one of the most profitable outposts of the pharmaceutical empire. Shire is a \u00a324bn transatlantic drugs group with big operations in the UK town of Basingstoke, and Pennsylvania and Massachusetts in the US. It shifted its corporate head office from the UK to Ireland for tax purposes in 2008 and is registered in the tax-friendly island of Jersey. The majority of its sales are in north America. One of Shire\u2019s Luxembourg units has made $1.87bn in profits in the last five years, largely from making loans to sister companies, as it charged interest rates of up to 9% on those loans. With what appears to be the consent of the Luxembourg authorities, the enormous profits generated by this unit were taxed at a fraction of 1%. Shire\u2019s tiny Luxembourg finance company in an office with dozens of other corporate occupants \u2014 Shire Holdings Europe No2 Sarl, or SHES2 for short \u2014 has lent out a total of more than $10bn. Away from Luxembourg, more than two-thirds of Shire\u2019s $5bn in annual revenues came from the sale of prescription drugs in the US and Canada last year. But group profits around the world were taxed at an average of 16.4% \u2014 less than half the official tax rate for most big businesses in America. Somehow, the FTSE 100 firm had hit upon the holy grail of tax management: a structure that allowed it to access some of the most profitable healthcare markets in the world while keeping its tax bill low at the same time. The main factor pushing down its tax bill is explained in the smallprint of the group\u2019s annual report as \u201cintra-group items\u201d. That is, the tax consequences of investments and transactions between Shire group companies around the world. Leaked letters from PwC, Shire\u2019s tax advisers, reveal how far Shire was prepared to go to conjure up tax advantages through highly artificial tax structures. The confidential papers reveal the critical role in group tax planning played by SHES2 \u2014 one of seven Shire companies incorporated in Luxembourg. Over the last five years this business received $1.91bn of interest income from loans it made to other Shire companies, including more than $580m last year alone. By the end of 2013, sister companies within the Shire group owed SHES2 more than $10bn in loans and interest \u2014 equivalent to more than two years\u2019 sales for the entire group. The Guardian asked Shire why it had such large internal loans when the overall group had few borrowing needs. Shire declined to comment. The borrower companies and where they operate remains unknown. It is likely however that the vast interest payments have created huge tax deductions for these sister units, whose profits are lowered by the cost of paying the interest on the Luxembourg loans. With minimal operating costs \u2014 including staff wage bills of less than $55,000 a year \u2014 SHES2 appears to be one of Shire\u2019s most lucrative business units with profits over five years of $1.87bn. But Shire\u2019s annual report makes mention of SHES2 only once, in an appendix that lists the group\u2019s subsidiaries. Meanwhile, accounts for SHES2, filed in Luxembourg, show that, despite its towering profits, the company recorded no corporate income tax charge at all. The Guardian sent a reporter to the offices of SHES2 in Luxembourg but found few of the trappings to be expected of a multi-million-dollar enterprise. Watch footage of Rupert Neate attempting to find a SHES2 employee in Luxembourg: Company filings show SHES2 had just four official managers, two of whom were senior figures in Shire\u2019s tax department, working at UK head office in Basingstoke, England. Among them is Fearghas Carruthers, the group\u2019s head of tax. The key to solving the riddle of how SHES2 appears to have made $1.91bn of interest income almost disappear for tax purposes is found in leaked Luxembourg letters from tax advisers at PwC to the local tax office. They offer a rare glimpse into the group\u2019s labyrinthine corporate structures. The answer lies in Ireland, where Shire moved its corporate headquarters from the UK in 2008 after the Labour government had attempted a crackdown on UK multinationals using internal financing companies in aggressive tax planning structures. Among a cluster of Irish-registered Shire firms is a holding company Shire Holdings Ireland No.2 Limited, or SHIL2 for short. This Irish company has for years been charging itself interest on billions of dollars of loans \u2014 to itself. More specifically, the interest has been charged on loans from SHIL2\u2019s head office registered near Dublin to a SHIL2 branch office in Luxembourg. Rupert Neate returned - to the same office block on the outskirts of Luxembourg city - to enquire about SHIL2. Leaked papers show that Shire\u2019s tax advisers told the Luxembourg tax authorities that this unusual lending within the same legal entity had transformed the drug group\u2019s wider activities in the Grand Duchy into a lending conduit: pushing one large loan from Ireland, through two Luxembourg units (SHIL2 and SHES2), and onwards to Shire companies around the world. Such a chain of back-to-back lending, advisers from PwC argued, effectively meant Shire\u2019s intra-group loans were only passing through Luxembourg. Therefore, the local taxman did not need to conduct a rigorous assessment of Shire\u2019s tax liabilities. The full Luxembourg corporate tax rate should still apply, but only on a notional amount of profit. In Shire\u2019s case, PwC suggested, the Grand Duchy should be satisfied taxing just \u201c1/64%\u201d \u2014 that is 0.0156% \u2014 of the billions in loans and interest owing to SHES2. A letter of consent from the Luxembourg tax office does not appear in the cache of leaked files, but it is clear from publicly available filings elsewhere that the avoidance structure was set up in 2008 and appears to have remained active at least as recently as the end of 2013. By the end, the complex structure had created a multi-billion-dollar lending chain, bearing no relation to Shire\u2019s overall borrowing needs. The structure appeared to have little commercial benefit other than a tax conjuring trick: tax bills have been lowered for Shire borrower companies around the world while the group\u2019s Luxembourg operations had all but escaped corresponding tax on the interest income. In a statement, the group said: \u201cShire Holdings Europe No.2 Sarl, is part of our overall treasury operations. We have a responsibility to all our stakeholders to manage our business responsibly; this includes managing our tax affairs in the interest of all stakeholders.\u201d Icap\u2019s skeleton-staffed multimillion dollar office Above a stamp shop, behind closed office blinds, on the first floor of a terrace building overlooking a park on Boulevard Prince Henri in Luxembourg City, the lights appear to be out. When the Guardian pressed the buzzer one October afternoon a male voice, with what seems a Dutch accent, sounds over the crackly intercom. The speaker confirmed this was, indeed, the Luxembourg offices of Icap, the London-listed financial trading group. Polite and good humoured, he chuckled and apologised for having to catch his breath, explaining he has just run down some stairs to answer the buzzer. He said little else about Icap\u2019s Luxembourg lending operations, however, and wouldn\u2019t let the Guardian in the building. Watch footage of our reporter, Rupert Neate, trying to make contact. Official filings show two Icap companies at this address. Together they have sucked hundreds of millions of dollars in interest income out of the high-tax US and, with the help of a third Icap unit, and made them all but disappear for tax purposes. Together they had lent a total of $870m to Icap operations in America by March 2008. Annual accounts since then show these loans remained on the companies\u2019 books unchanged every year. They were still outstanding at the end of March this year. Last week the Guardian approached Icap with the findings from its investigation into the broker firm\u2019s Luxembourg activities. In response, Icap explained that the loans had just recently been repaid in full by the group\u2019s US operations, and that a process to wind down its Luxembourg unit had begun only last month. No such information was relayed by the voice on the intercom, though Icap\u2019s local manager has since explained that Luxembourg secrecy laws meant he could not offer explanations. Company accounts suggest neither of the two Icap lending firms had much commercial activity - other than the holding of large loans to the US. The companies\u2019 names are as long as they are uninformative \u2014 Icap Luxembourg Holdings (No.1) Sarl and Icap Luxembourg (No.2) Sarl. In leaked tax correspondence they are abbreviated to generic terms \u201cLuxCo1\u201d and \u201cLuxCo2\u201d. Over the last seven years, the two each had just one employee \u2014 paid an annual wage of less than $15,000 \u2014 while other costs of operating above the stamp shop have also been consistently small. It is a far cry from Icap\u2019s busy trading desks in New York and London, scenes from which every year appear in the newspapers as a string of celebrities take over the dealing phones as part of a charity day. Last year the Duchess of Cornwall and Strictly Come Dancing\u2019s Craig Revel Horwood manned the lines. Offering services in many of the busiest financial markets \u2014 foreign exchange, credit, interest rates and equities \u2014 the group has a busy role at the heart of the City of London, Wall Street and other financial centres. The chief executive, Michael Spencer, has the best political connections, serving as treasurer of the Conservative party between 2006 an 2010. His donations to the party have totalled nearly \u00a35m. But no celebrities or cabinet ministers have ties to Icap\u2019s quiet Luxembourg offices. LuxCo1 and LuxCo2 are not mentioned among the 22 main subsidiaries listed in Icap\u2019s annual report. Yet together the two companies received a total of $247m in interest on their loans to the US in the last seven years. And thanks to modest overheads - the pedestrian office, the single employee - almost all of the interest income converted into profit, making LuxCo1 and LuxCo2 among the most lucrative subsidiaries within the Icap empire. The tax position on the Luxembourg lending profits is less than clear from company accounts, which record both LuxCo1 and LuxCo2 as having no income tax to pay at all for the seven years reviewed by the Guardian. The true position, however, is discoverable with the help of leaked tax approvals given to Icap, in private, by the Luxembourg taxman. These show that LuxCo1 and LuxCo2 were treated in their tax returns as part of a lending chain. Although neither company had any borrowings themselves, another ICAP unit, registered to the same address on Boulevard Prince Henri did. The Icap borrower company in question has an innocuous sounding name \u2014 ICAP US Holdings No2 Ltd, or ICAP US2 for short \u2014 but it is a truly exotic corporate creature. Despite having just one employee, paid $12,000 in Luxembourg, this UK tax-resident company has three registered addresses: a law firm in Gibraltar; Icap\u2019s international headquarters on Broadgate in the City of London; and the office above the stamp shop on Boulevard Prince Henri. A clue as to its importance to Icap\u2019s finance and tax affairs comes from the list of directors at Icap US2. These include Stephen Caplen, deputy financial director for the Icap group, and David Ireland, Icap\u2019s head of tax. In the Luxembourg branch office, meanwhile, the sole \u201crepr\u00e9sentant permanent\u201d is the non-board member Paul de Haan. Watch the video to learn more about Mr de Haan\u2019s role. A leaked Luxembourg tax deal, covering all three Icap financing units, shows these units were treated collectively as a the middle link in a lending chain: a conduit rather than a lender. As a result, the local tax office agreed, the borrowing activities of Icap US2\u2019s Luxembourg branch was generating tax deductions that could be neatly offset against the tax liabilities on almost all interest income earned at LuxCo1 and LuxCo2. The resulting near-zero tax bill in Luxembourg could hardly be seen as controversial \u2014 so long, of course, as the millions paid out in interest by Icap US2 in the Grand Duchy was taxed when it became income for the lending company. And therein lies the twist. The lender to ICAP US2 was, in fact, ICAP US 2 itself. More precisely, ICAP US2 was lending hundreds of millions of dollars to its Luxembourg branch. In an exotic arrangement \u2014 one seen elsewhere repeatedly in the leaked tax files \u2014 the group was effectively paying interest to itself. Meanwhile, in Britain, tax inspectors scrutinising this arrangement recognised there was something unusual afoot. But there was not much they could do to block it, because the UK does not recognise such internal company lending as taxable. The result was that Icap\u2019s interest payments - paid by Icap US2\u2019s Luxembourg branch to another part of Icap US2 in a different country - almost disappeared, for tax purposes. The saving ran into many tens of million of dollars. That said, the UK taxman was not entirely without powers to act. HMRC was able to use its anti-avoidance powers, under the so-called \u201ccontrolled foreign companies\u201d regime, to winkle out a relatively small amount of tax from Icap US2. Over the last five years for which there are available accounts, Icap US2 appears to have paid an average corporate income tax of $3m a year to HMRC and $83,500 to Luxembourg. While the precise effective tax rate achieved on Icap\u2019s interest income is hard to calculate, it is clear that it is a fraction of the headline corporate tax rates in the US and UK over the last seven years. In a statement to the Guardian, Icap said: \u201cIcap is a British company, which has always paid more tax than the UK corporation tax rate, and we do not engage in aggressive tax avoidance. We pay all taxes due on the profits earned in the countries in which we operate. Our Luxembourg financing operation was created to support a series of acquisitions Icap made in the US in the 2000\u2019s, and is now being wound down to reduce costs. Its profits were taxed in the UK. It is an entirely standard financing method and was agreed by HMRC.\u201d Dyson sweeps away profits from the taxman Up until 2010 the corporate structure behind Dyson, the hand dryer and vacuum cleaner group, was as functional as its products. Shares in Dyson James Ltd (DJL), the main business, based in Malmesbury in Wiltshire, were owned by inventor and entrepreneur Sir James Dyson, with the founder\u2019s three children each holding minority stakes. The billionaire industrial designer, who came up with the bagless vacuum cleaner and built a company with a \u00a31bn turnover, has become a figurehead and spokesman for UK engineering and science. In the late 2000s a rash of businesses moved their headquarter operations abroad. Shire, UBM and WPP had moved to Ireland. Ineos switched to Switzerland. Dyson did not approve. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any plans to do that [move tax domicile],\u201d he said in 2008. \u201cI think it\u2019s wrong to direct your business for tax reasons. Your business should be where you can do it best.\u201d However, his company went on to use elaborate tax structures after he made those comments. At the start of 2010, new tiers of holding and finance companies began sprouting into life above DJL. Shares in DJL were now owned by a new UK holding company: Dyson James Group Ltd (DJG), which in turn became a subsidiary of Clear Cover Ltd, a parent company incorporated in Malta. Two group financing companies were also established: one in the Isle of Man called Silver Cyclone, one in Luxembourg called Blue Blade. Leaked details of tax deals with the Luxembourg tax office show these were to be the vehicles for a \u00a3300m injection of loans into DJG in the UK. Like all good corporate manoeuvres it was given a muscular-sounding code name: Project Ajax. In a matter of months, the simple corporate architecture that existed before had been swept aside. Dyson and his children remained the ultimate owners but their immediate interest was now in a company registered to an address on Ting\u00e9 Point in the Maltese costal town of Sliema, the site of a former British barracks. Back in Britain, financial transactions that bore little relation to breaking new ground in product design began to take place. Instead of product engineering, this was financial engineering. In 2010 DJG had to meet new interest costs of \u00a35.37m that were paid to newly-created sister company Blue Blade, filings in Luxembourg show. These costs are thought to have been largely or entirely tax-deductible - meaning they lowered profits at DJG, and thus its tax bill. Dyson declined to confirm this, saying only that tax matters were commercially sensitive. Accounts for Blue Blade show the company\u2019s corporation tax for 2010 was just \u00a355,037 \u2014 an effective tax rate of just under 1%. Somehow the business had escaped tax at anything close to the then headline rate of over 28% in Luxembourg. Only in leaked tax papers is an explanation to be found. In a 2009 letter to Marius Kohl, one of Luxembourg\u2019s top taxmen, Dyson\u2019s tax advisers at PwC argued the case for Blue Blade to be charged tax on only a small fraction of its interest income. The letter makes clear PwC had met with Kohl to discuss the matter a month earlier. At the heart of the tax advisers\u2019 case was a claim that Blue Blade should pay almost no tax because although it had lent \u00a3300m to DJG, it had also borrowed \u00a3299m from Isle of Man-based Silver Cyclone. PwC make no secret of the fact that the loan from the Isle of Man was interest-free. Nevertheless, it suggests, Blue Blade should properly benefit from a tax deduction as if it had been required to pay interest to Silver Cyclone. \u201c[Blue Blade] will be allowed to deduct a deemed interest on its interest free debt involved in the financial on-lending activity\u201d, PwC wrote. Rather than taxing all of Blue Blade\u2019s lending profits, Luxembourg should only tax a tiny fraction of the sums borrowed. The nine-page PwC letter was sent to Kohl on 11 November. On the same day, the Luxembourg taxman sent back a two-paragraph reply: \u201cFurther to your letter... relating to the transactions that [the Dyson group] would like to conduct, I find the contents of said letter to be in compliance with the current tax legislation and administrative practice.\u201d With these words, Kohl provided official sanction for the Dyson scheme to go ahead as PwC had described. The Guardian asked the Dyson group why Blue Blade should qualify for a tax deduction over \u201cdeemed interest\u201d costs when, in reality, this company had almost no borrowing costs thanks to the interest-free loan from Silver Cyclone. Dyson did not answer. In a statement it said: \u201cAdvice a number of years ago was that a non-UK holding structure would aid growth further, however, that has not turned out to be the case and the holding structure of Dyson group is now entirely in the UK.\u201d For reasons unknown, the \u00a3300m loan from Blue Blade was repaid in less than a year. But analysis of Dyson filings in the UK, Luxembourg, Malta and Isle of Man show that in 2011 the group rebuilt a near identical structure. This time, however, millions of pounds in interest payments from UK operations went to a Luxembourg company called Copper Blade. And the payments were higher as the Malmesbury holding company had borrowed \u00a3550m. This large loan was partly repaid in 2011 and again in 2012, with all debts and the entire structure unwound last year. Dyson told the Guardian: \u201cThe Dyson family business paid \u00a3330m in UK tax over the past three years, clearly not the act of a company avoiding its fair share of tax. Dyson\u2019s success means that over 85% of its technology is sold overseas ... At no time did the [group\u2019s former] non-UK structure deliver any significant tax advantage and, of the entities in question all have been dissolved or are in a liquidation process.\u201d Analysis: Havens make for a global race to the bottom Richard Brooks writes: \u201cOccupying a damp 1,000 square miles where the French, German and Belgian borders meet, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg is a far cry from the palm-fringed tropical island tax haven of popular imagination. \u201cIn fact the country owes its status as the world\u2019s premier corporate tax haven to its position at the heart of Europe. A founding member of the European Economic Community in 1957, Luxembourg enjoys all the freedoms governing investment in what is now the European Union. These and a network of taxation agreements with all the world\u2019s leading economies ensure the Grand Duchy is accepted in a club of leading nations that share basic principles on how to tax corporations operating across national borders. \u201cSuch a privilege would never be afforded to island-in-the-sun tax havens. Large economies, such as the US and UK, typically block multinationals from shifting profits to low-tax territories by imposing \u2018withholding taxes\u2019 on payments leaving their borders. Luxembourg, by contrast, is a respected member of the international economic club, and assumed therefore to tax its companies fully; it even has a corporate income tax system with a 29% rate that is now relatively high by international standards. So money flows into the country tax-free. \u201cSecretly, however, Luxembourg is a tax haven, offering a range of ways in which payments that reduce a multinational\u2019s taxable profits in a country such as the UK or US can escape tax when received in the Grand Duchy. These include: exempting income diverted to foreign branches of Luxembourg companies in places like Switzerland and Ireland, tax relief for paper investment losses, and the approval of complex \u2018hybrid\u2019 financial instruments and corporate structures within its borders. Top FTSE 100 firms like Vodafone and GlaxoSmithKline are known to have exploited these opportunities to channel billions through Luxembourg companies. \u201cWhen a multinational approaches the Luxembourg tax authorities with a scheme employing one of these tactics, after a meeting or two to chew over the details a senior official rubber-stamps the plan and the company walks away with a big tax break. In this way the Grand Duchy behaves like the club member who enjoys all the benefits of membership while quietly pilfering from the kitty. \u201cIt might be an underhand way to run a tax system, but it serves Luxembourg well. The country has the highest levels of foreign investment inflows and outflows in the EU, taking a small but valuable tax levy as the money washes through. Corporate income taxes, at 5% of GDP, consequently form a far greater share of Luxembourg\u2019s finances than they do in other EU countries. \u201cAs the world cottons on to Luxembourg\u2019s tax poaching, pressure for reform grows. So does embarrassment for the new president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, who as prime minister of the Grand Duchy for 18 years until 2013 presided over the activity. Revelations of precisely how its corporate tax avoidance factory works give the lie to Juncker\u2019s repeated protestations that the country is not a tax haven. \u201cInvestigations by the European Commission into deals offered by Juncker\u2019s government to Amazon and Fiat might or might not conclude that they constituted anti-competitive \u2018state aid\u2019. But these inquiries concern the possibility of \u2018sweetheart deals\u2019 for favoured companies, when the bigger problem is that Luxembourg offers major tax breaks to all companies \u2013 as long as they have enough money. \u201cNeutering Luxembourg as a tax haven at the heart of Europe requires an overhaul of its corporate tax law and administration. A concerted effort coordinated by the OECD aims to bring many of the tax structures facilitated by Luxembourg to an end. But, even if its proposals are technically sufficient, it will take intense political pressure to force Luxembourg to implement them. \u201cIn the meantime, despite his claims to be spearheading the OECD\u2019s work, George Osborne has enhanced the allure of Luxembourg\u2019s tax breaks. In 2012 he drastically scaled back anti-tax avoidance laws targeted at multinationals\u2019 so-called \u2018controlled foreign companies\u2019. These are tax laws that since 1984 have caught profits diverted by UK multinationals into tax havens. In a move specifically aimed at favouring finance companies established in Luxembourg, Osborne reduced the tax on their profits to no more than 5%. \u201cOsborne\u2019s changes are designed to make the UK an attractive place for multinationals to base themselves. They do so by accommodating predatory tax practices, in response to opportunities provided by countries like the Netherlands and Luxembourg. Other widely publicised tax breaks such as the \u2018patent box\u2019 special tax rate for income from intellectual property mimic concessions elsewhere. \u201cThis is the real harm that tax havens like Luxembourg cause. They turn \u2018tax competition\u2019 into a global race to the bottom, depleting the contributions of major corporations and leaving citizens to pick up the tab.\u201d Richard Brooks is the author of The Great Tax Robbery \u2013 How Britain became a tax haven for fat cats and big business.

In 2010, DJG paid an effective corporation tax rate of 26.4%, compared to the UK corporation tax rate of 28%, the difference being principally due to factors such as UK tax incentives to encourage research and development.

Shire is a \u00a324bn transatlantic drugs group with big operations in the UK town of Basingstoke, and Pennsylvania and Massachusetts in the US.<strong> </strong>It shifted its corporate head office from the UK to Ireland for tax purposes in 2008 and is registered in the tax-friendly island of Jersey. The majority of its sales are in north America.<br></p> <p>One of Shire\u2019s Luxembourg units has made $1.87bn in profits in the last five years, largely from making loans to sister companies, as it charged interest rates of up to 9% on those loans.

By the end of 2013, sister companies within the Shire group owed SHES2 more than $10bn in loans and interest \u2014 equivalent to more than two years\u2019 sales for the entire group. </p> <p>The Guardian asked Shire why it had such large internal loans when the overall group had few borrowing needs. Shire declined to comment. </p> <p>The borrower companies and where they operate remains unknown. It is likely however that the vast interest payments have created huge tax deductions for these sister units, whose profits are lowered by the cost of paying the interest on the Luxembourg loans. <br></p> <p>With minimal operating costs \u2014 including staff wage bills of less than $55,000 a year \u2014 SHES2 appears to be one of Shire\u2019s most lucrative business units with profits over five years of $1.87bn. </p> <p>But Shire\u2019s annual report makes mention of SHES2 only once, in an appendix that lists the group\u2019s subsidiaries. </p> <p>Meanwhile, accounts for SHES2, filed in Luxembourg, show that, despite its towering profits, the company recorded no corporate income tax charge at all.</p> <p>The Guardian sent a reporter to the offices of SHES2 in Luxembourg but found few of the trappings to be expected of a multi-million-dollar enterprise.

Therefore, the local taxman did not need to conduct a rigorous assessment of Shire\u2019s tax liabilities. The full Luxembourg corporate tax rate should still apply, but only on a notional amount of profit. In Shire\u2019s case, PwC suggested, the Grand Duchy should be satisfied taxing just \u201c1/64%\u201d \u2014 that is 0.0156% \u2014 of the billions in loans and interest owing to SHES2.</p> <p>A letter of consent from the Luxembourg tax office does not appear in the cache of leaked files, but it is clear from publicly available filings elsewhere that the avoidance structure was set up in 2008 and appears to have remained active at least as recently as the end of 2013. </p> <p>By the end, the complex structure had created a multi-billion-dollar lending chain, bearing no relation to Shire\u2019s overall borrowing needs. The structure appeared to have little commercial benefit other than a tax conjuring trick: tax bills have been lowered for Shire borrower companies around the world while the group\u2019s Luxembourg operations had all but escaped corresponding tax on the interest income. </p> <p>In a statement, the group said: \u201cShire Holdings Europe No.2 Sarl, is part of our overall treasury operations.

His <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-17512814\">donations</a> to the party have totalled nearly \u00a35m. </p> <p>But no celebrities or cabinet ministers have ties to Icap\u2019s quiet Luxembourg offices. LuxCo1 and LuxCo2 are not mentioned among the 22 main subsidiaries listed in Icap\u2019s annual report. Yet together the two companies received a total of $247m in interest on their loans to the US in the last seven years.</p> <p>And thanks to modest overheads - the pedestrian office, the single employee - almost all of the interest income converted into profit, making LuxCo1 and LuxCo2 among the most lucrative subsidiaries within the Icap empire. </p> <p>The tax position on the Luxembourg lending profits is less than clear from company accounts, which record both LuxCo1 and LuxCo2 as having no income tax to pay at all for the seven years reviewed by the Guardian.</p> <p>The true position, however, is discoverable with the help of leaked tax approvals given to Icap, in private, by the Luxembourg taxman. These show that LuxCo1 and LuxCo2 were treated in their tax returns as part of a lending chain. Although neither company had any borrowings themselves, another ICAP unit, registered to the same address on Boulevard Prince Henri did.</p> <p>The Icap borrower company in question has an innocuous sounding name \u2014 ICAP US Holdings No2 Ltd, or ICAP US2 for short \u2014 but it is a truly exotic corporate creature. Despite having just one employee, paid $12,000 in Luxembourg, this UK tax-resident company has three registered addresses: a law firm in Gibraltar; Icap\u2019s international headquarters on Broadgate in the City of London; and the office above the stamp shop on Boulevard Prince Henri.</p> <p>A clue as to its importance to Icap\u2019s finance and tax affairs comes from the list of directors at Icap US2. These include Stephen Caplen, deputy financial director for the Icap group, and David Ireland, Icap\u2019s head of tax. In the Luxembourg branch office, meanwhile, the sole \u201crepr\u00e9sentant permanent\u201d is the non-board member Paul de Haan. Watch the video to learn more about Mr de Haan\u2019s role. </p> <p>A leaked Luxembourg tax deal, covering all three Icap financing units, shows these units were treated collectively as a the middle link in a lending chain: a conduit rather than a lender.</p> <p>As a result, the local tax office agreed, the borrowing activities of Icap US2\u2019s Luxembourg branch was generating tax deductions that could be neatly offset against the tax liabilities on almost all interest income earned at LuxCo1 and LuxCo2. </p> <p>The resulting near-zero tax bill in Luxembourg could hardly be seen as controversial \u2014 so long, of course, as the millions paid out in interest by Icap US2 in the Grand Duchy was taxed when it became income for the lending company. And therein lies the twist.</p> <p>The lender to ICAP US2 was, in fact, ICAP US 2 itself. More precisely, ICAP US2 was lending hundreds of millions of dollars to its Luxembourg branch. In an exotic arrangement \u2014 one seen elsewhere repeatedly in the leaked tax files \u2014 the group was effectively paying interest to itself.</p> <p>Meanwhile, in Britain, tax inspectors scrutinising this arrangement recognised there was something unusual afoot. But there was not much they could do to block it, because the UK does not recognise such internal company lending as taxable.</p> <p>The result was that Icap\u2019s interest payments - paid by Icap US2\u2019s Luxembourg branch to another part of Icap US2 in a different country - almost disappeared, for tax purposes. The saving ran into many tens of million of dollars. </p> <p>That said, the UK taxman was not entirely without powers to act. HMRC was able to use its anti-avoidance powers, under the so-called \u201ccontrolled foreign companies\u201d regime, to winkle out a relatively small amount of tax from Icap US2. </p> <p>Over the last five years for which there are available accounts, Icap US2 appears to have paid an average corporate income tax of $3m a year to HMRC and $83,500 to Luxembourg.</p> <p>While the precise effective tax rate achieved on Icap\u2019s interest income is hard to calculate, it is clear that it is a fraction of the headline corporate tax rates in the US and UK over the last seven years.</p> <p>In a statement to the Guardian, Icap said: \u201cIcap is a British company, which has always paid more tax than the UK corporation tax rate, and we do not engage in aggressive tax avoidance. We pay all taxes due on the profits earned in the countries in which we operate. Our Luxembourg financing operation was created to support a series of acquisitions Icap made in the US in the 2000\u2019s, and is now being wound down to reduce costs. Its profits were taxed in the UK. It is an entirely standard financing method and was agreed by HMRC.\u201d</p> <h2>Dyson sweeps away profits from the taxman<br></h2> <p>Up until 2010 the corporate structure behind Dyson, the hand dryer and vacuum cleaner group, was as functional as its products.</p> <p>Shares in Dyson James Ltd (DJL), the main business, based in Malmesbury in Wiltshire, were owned by inventor and entrepreneur Sir James Dyson, with the founder\u2019s three children each holding minority stakes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed element--supporting\" data-alt=\"Dyson graphic one\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://static.guim.co.uk/ni/1415193288037/dyson1.svg&quot;style=&quot;width:100%;&quot;&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The billionaire industrial designer, who came up with the bagless vacuum cleaner and built a company with a \u00a31bn turnover, has become a figurehead and spokesman for UK engineering and science. </p> <p>In the late 2000s a rash of businesses moved their headquarter operations abroad. Shire, UBM and WPP had moved to Ireland. Ineos switched to Switzerland.

Your business should be where you can do it best.\u201d</p> <p>However, his company went on to use elaborate tax structures after he made those comments.</p> <p>At the start of 2010, new tiers of holding and finance companies began sprouting into life above DJL.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed element--supporting\" data-alt=\"Dyson graphic 2\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://static.guim.co.uk/ni/1415193288191/dyson2.svg&quot;style=&quot;width:100%;&quot;&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Shares in DJL were now owned by a new UK holding company: Dyson James Group Ltd (DJG), which in turn became a subsidiary of Clear Cover Ltd, a parent company incorporated in Malta.</p> <p>Two group financing companies were also established: one in the Isle of Man called Silver Cyclone, one in Luxembourg called Blue Blade.</p> <p>Leaked details of tax deals with the Luxembourg tax office show these were to be the vehicles for a \u00a3300m injection of loans into DJG in the UK. Like all good corporate manoeuvres it was given a muscular-sounding code name: Project Ajax.</p> <p>In a matter of months, the simple corporate architecture that existed before had been swept aside. Dyson and his children remained the ultimate owners but their immediate interest was now in a company registered to an address on Ting\u00e9 Point in the Maltese costal town of Sliema, the site of a former British barracks.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed element--supporting\" data-alt=\"Dyson graphic 3\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://static.guim.co.uk/ni/1415193288287/dyson3.svg&quot;style=&quot;width:100%;&quot;&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Back in Britain, financial transactions that bore little relation to breaking new ground in product design began to take place. Instead of product engineering, this was financial engineering.</p> <p>In 2010 DJG had to meet new interest costs of \u00a35.37m that were paid to newly-created sister company Blue Blade, filings in Luxembourg show. These costs are thought to have been largely or entirely tax-deductible - meaning they lowered profits at DJG, and thus its tax bill.</p> <p>Dyson declined to confirm this, saying only that tax matters were commercially sensitive.</p> <p>Accounts for Blue Blade show the company\u2019s corporation tax for 2010 was just \u00a355,037 \u2014 an effective tax rate of just under 1%. Somehow the business had escaped tax at anything close to the then headline rate of over 28% in Luxembourg.</p> <p>Only in leaked tax papers is an explanation to be found. In a 2009 letter to Marius Kohl, one of Luxembourg\u2019s top taxmen, Dyson\u2019s tax advisers at PwC argued the case for Blue Blade to be charged tax on only a small fraction of its interest income.</p> <p>The letter makes clear PwC had met with Kohl to discuss the matter a month earlier.</p> <p>At the heart of the tax advisers\u2019 case was a claim that Blue Blade should pay almost no tax because although it had lent \u00a3300m to DJG, it had also borrowed \u00a3299m from Isle of Man-based Silver Cyclone.</p> <p>PwC make no secret of the fact that the loan from the Isle of Man was interest-free. Nevertheless, it suggests, Blue Blade should properly benefit from a tax deduction as if it had been required to pay interest to Silver Cyclone.</p> <p>\u201c[Blue Blade] will be allowed to deduct a deemed interest on its interest free debt involved in the financial on-lending activity\u201d, PwC wrote. Rather than taxing all of Blue Blade\u2019s lending profits, Luxembourg should only tax a tiny fraction of the sums borrowed.</p> <p>The nine-page PwC letter was sent to Kohl on 11 November. On the same day, the Luxembourg taxman sent back a two-paragraph reply: \u201cFurther to your letter... relating to the transactions that [the Dyson group] would like to conduct, I find the contents of said letter to be in compliance with the current tax legislation and administrative practice.\u201d</p> <p>With these words, Kohl provided official sanction for the Dyson scheme to go ahead as PwC had described.</p> <p>The Guardian asked the Dyson group why Blue Blade should qualify for a tax deduction over \u201cdeemed interest\u201d costs when, in reality, this company had almost no borrowing costs thanks to the interest-free loan from Silver Cyclone. Dyson did not answer.</p> <p>In a statement it said: \u201cAdvice a number of years ago was that a non-UK holding structure would aid growth further, however, that has not turned out to be the case and the holding structure of Dyson group is now entirely in the UK.\u201d</p> <p>For reasons unknown, the \u00a3300m loan from Blue Blade was repaid in less than a year. But analysis of Dyson filings in the UK, Luxembourg, Malta and Isle of Man show that in 2011 the group rebuilt a near identical structure. This time, however, millions of pounds in interest payments from UK operations went to a Luxembourg company called Copper Blade. And the payments were higher as the Malmesbury holding company had borrowed \u00a3550m.</p> <p>This large loan was partly repaid in 2011 and again in 2012, with all debts and the entire structure unwound last year.</p> <p>Dyson told the Guardian: \u201cThe Dyson family business paid \u00a3330m in UK tax over the past three years, clearly not the act of a company avoiding its fair share of tax. Dyson\u2019s success means that over 85% of its technology is sold overseas ... At no time did the [group\u2019s former] non-UK structure deliver any significant tax advantage and, of the entities in question all have been dissolved or are in a liquidation process.\u201d </p> <h2>Analysis: Havens make for a global race to the bottom</h2> <p><em>Richard Brooks writes:</em> \u201cOccupying a damp 1,000 square miles where the French, German and Belgian borders meet, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg is a far cry from the palm-fringed tropical island tax haven of popular imagination.</p> <p>\u201cIn fact the country owes its status as the world\u2019s premier corporate tax haven to its position at the heart of Europe. A founding member of the European Economic Community in 1957, Luxembourg enjoys all the freedoms governing investment in what is now the European Union.

Large economies, such as the US and UK, typically block multinationals from shifting profits to low-tax territories by imposing \u2018withholding taxes\u2019 on payments leaving their borders. Luxembourg, by contrast, is a respected member of the international economic club, and assumed therefore to tax its companies fully; it even has a corporate income tax system with a 29% rate that is now relatively high by international standards. So money flows into the country tax-free.</p> <p>\u201cSecretly, however, Luxembourg is a tax haven, offering a range of ways in which payments that reduce a multinational\u2019s taxable profits in a country such as the UK or US can escape tax when received in the Grand Duchy. These include: exempting income diverted to foreign branches of Luxembourg companies in places like Switzerland and Ireland, tax relief for paper investment losses, and the approval of complex \u2018hybrid\u2019 financial instruments and corporate structures within its borders. Top FTSE 100 firms like Vodafone and GlaxoSmithKline are known to have exploited these opportunities to channel billions through Luxembourg companies. </p> <p>\u201cWhen a multinational approaches the Luxembourg tax authorities with a scheme employing one of these tactics, after a meeting or two to chew over the details a senior official rubber-stamps the plan and the company walks away with a big tax break. In this way the Grand Duchy behaves like the club member who enjoys all the benefits of membership while quietly pilfering from the kitty.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> <blockquote> <p>\"Luxembourg is like the club member who enjoys all the benefits of membership while quietly pilfering from the kitty\"</p> <footer> <cite>Richard Brooks</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt might be an underhand way to run a tax system, but it serves Luxembourg well. The country has the highest levels of foreign investment inflows and outflows in the EU, taking a small but valuable tax levy as the money washes through. Corporate income taxes, at 5% of GDP, consequently form a far greater share of Luxembourg\u2019s finances than they do in other EU countries.</p> <p>\u201cAs the world cottons on to Luxembourg\u2019s tax poaching, pressure for reform grows. So does embarrassment for the new president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, who as prime minister of the Grand Duchy for 18 years until 2013 presided over the activity. Revelations of precisely how its corporate tax avoidance factory works give the lie to Juncker\u2019s repeated protestations that the country is not a tax haven. </p> <p>\u201cInvestigations by the European Commission into deals offered by Juncker\u2019s government to Amazon and Fiat might or might not conclude that they constituted anti-competitive \u2018state aid\u2019. But these inquiries concern the possibility of \u2018sweetheart deals\u2019 for favoured companies, when the bigger problem is that Luxembourg offers major tax breaks to all companies \u2013 as long as they have enough money.</p> <p>\u201cNeutering Luxembourg as a tax haven at the heart of Europe requires an overhaul of its corporate tax law and administration. A concerted effort coordinated by the OECD aims to bring many of the tax structures facilitated by Luxembourg to an end. But, even if its proposals are technically sufficient, it will take intense political pressure to force Luxembourg to implement them.</p> <p>\u201cIn the meantime, despite his claims to be spearheading the OECD\u2019s work, George Osborne has enhanced the allure of Luxembourg\u2019s tax breaks. In 2012 he drastically scaled back anti-tax avoidance laws targeted at multinationals\u2019 so-called \u2018controlled foreign companies\u2019. These are tax laws that since 1984 have caught profits diverted by UK multinationals into tax havens. In a move specifically aimed at favouring finance companies established in Luxembourg, Osborne reduced the tax on their profits to no more than 5%.</p> <p>\u201cOsborne\u2019s changes are designed to make the UK an attractive place for multinationals to base themselves. They do so by accommodating predatory tax practices, in response to opportunities provided by countries like the Netherlands and Luxembourg. Other widely publicised tax breaks such as the \u2018patent box\u2019 special tax rate for income from intellectual property mimic concessions elsewhere.</p> <p>\u201cThis is the real harm that tax havens like Luxembourg cause. They turn \u2018tax competition\u2019 into a global race to the bottom, depleting the contributions of major corporations and leaving citizens to pick up the tab.\u201d</p> <p><em>Richard Brooks is the author of The Great Tax Robbery \u2013 How Britain became a tax haven for fat cats and big business.</em></p> <h2>Find out more or get in touch</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.icij.org/project/luxembourg-leaks/explore-documents-luxembourg-leaks-database\">The full set of documents</a> has been published by the <a href=\"http://www.icij.org/\">ICIJ</a>.

In 2010, DJG paid an effective corporation tax rate of 26.4%, compared to the UK corporation tax rate of 28%, the difference being principally due to factors such as UK tax incentives to encourage research and development.

      "body": "<p>The debate about how to get better mobile phone coverage to remote villages and country roads has today driven straight into the fraught issue of national security and surveillance.</p> <p>Theresa May, the home secretary, has written to other ministers <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/nov/05/theresa-may-not-spots-sajid-javid-mobile-phones\" title=\"\">warning them</a> that a plan by her political rival, Sajid Javid, the culture secretary, to force the UK\u2019s four networks to share their signal in the shires will leave the country open to terrorist attacks.</p> <p>The prime minister, who was unable to make calls while on holiday in Cornwall,is keen to find a solution. Rural residents are desperate for better broadband services, so a pre-election pledge to bring more homes within reach of a simple voice call would seem like a way to swing a few more votes.</p> <p>There is no doubt that improvements to mobile and broadband infrastructure bring economic benefits. But operators were already resisting Javid\u2019s proposals on commercial grounds. Now that May has waded in on their side, will security concerns derail the project?</p> <p>Today, 1.5m people live in areas where there is a signal from one or two, but not all four, mobile phone networks. These partial \u201cnot-spots\u201d affect 20% of the UK landmass, 3% of premises, 10% of A roads and 16% of B roads. Investment by O2 and Vodafone, which have agreed to share masts, will reduce partial not-spots to 13% of the landmass soon. But how to bring that number to zero?</p> <p>Javid\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/eliminating-poor-mobile-coverage\" title=\"\">proposals, released for consultation on Wednesday,</a> offer three solutions. The most controversial is called national roaming \u2013 allowing customers to jump from one network to another, depending which has the best or only available signal. It is similar to international roaming, when deals between operators mean we can use foreign networks while travelling without having to subscribe.</p> <p>This solution would tackle all the partial not-spots, but cost up to \u00a3400m over 10 years in new IT systems, testing and equipment, plus potentially higher rental costs for mast sites. There could be higher charges for customers too, as networks buy minutes from each other. Another proposal is for a single subscription giving access to all four networks, sold for example by Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile. Finally, the operators are proposing to share more masts, mast sites, and equipment.

      "bodyText": "The debate about how to get better mobile phone coverage to remote villages and country roads has today driven straight into the fraught issue of national security and surveillance. Theresa May, the home secretary, has written to other ministers warning them that a plan by her political rival, Sajid Javid, the culture secretary, to force the UK\u2019s four networks to share their signal in the shires will leave the country open to terrorist attacks. The prime minister, who was unable to make calls while on holiday in Cornwall,is keen to find a solution. Rural residents are desperate for better broadband services, so a pre-election pledge to bring more homes within reach of a simple voice call would seem like a way to swing a few more votes. There is no doubt that improvements to mobile and broadband infrastructure bring economic benefits. But operators were already resisting Javid\u2019s proposals on commercial grounds. Now that May has waded in on their side, will security concerns derail the project? Today, 1.5m people live in areas where there is a signal from one or two, but not all four, mobile phone networks. These partial \u201cnot-spots\u201d affect 20% of the UK landmass, 3% of premises, 10% of A roads and 16% of B roads. Investment by O2 and Vodafone, which have agreed to share masts, will reduce partial not-spots to 13% of the landmass soon. But how to bring that number to zero? Javid\u2019s proposals, released for consultation on Wednesday, offer three solutions. The most controversial is called national roaming \u2013 allowing customers to jump from one network to another, depending which has the best or only available signal. It is similar to international roaming, when deals between operators mean we can use foreign networks while travelling without having to subscribe. This solution would tackle all the partial not-spots, but cost up to \u00a3400m over 10 years in new IT systems, testing and equipment, plus potentially higher rental costs for mast sites. There could be higher charges for customers too, as networks buy minutes from each other. Another proposal is for a single subscription giving access to all four networks, sold for example by Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile. Finally, the operators are proposing to share more masts, mast sites, and equipment. Javid\u2019s advisers reckon their proposals would only reduce not-spot areas to 3% of the landmass. May\u2019s letter, which is light on technical detail, says national roaming would make life more complicated for the police and security services. One operator source dismissed her arguments as a politically motivated \u201cred herring\u201d. Others, however, warn national roaming would make it almost impossible to trace the location of a call in real time in rural areas, harder to tap calls, and more complicated to retrospectively retrieve metadata \u2013 information such as who was calling whom, where and when. To trace caller location in real time, for example in a kidnapping, the work is done manually and requires a team of people at the network\u2019s data centre. They track the call from mast to mast, while the police listen in over the phone. But national roaming would not be seamless \u2013 meaning the caller would be cut off each time a call changed masts. When they dialled again, they could be routed through a different network. This could happen every two or three minutes in a moving vehicle. If the police were tracking location through Vodafone, because that was the caller\u2019s usual network, they would lose contact once was the call was routed through an EE mast, for example. To be sure of following a rural caller jumping between three or four networks, the police would have to set up simultaneous tracking operations. The same issues arise when listening in to calls. For retrospectively retrieving information on calls, text messages and web browsing \u2013 the metadata showing where and when a call was made, and to whom \u2013 police would need to issue requests to all four networks. According to an operator source: \u201cYou go from a position where you have a single source of information \u2013 one network \u2013 to forcing police and security services to assemble a jigsaw.\u201d Such blanket issuing of warrants would seem to take us in the opposite direction from the proportionate and targeted surveillance many would prefer.

The US market was also helped by positive private sector jobs data from the latest report from payroll processor ADP, ahead of Friday\u2019s non-farm payroll numbers. A fall in US oil inventories and reports of a pipeline fire in Saudi Arabia have combined to lift crude prices off their lows, and help oil shares regain some ground.

Finally, a word of caution if you are walking around the City of London. British Land has just issued a statement saying a couple of bolts recently broke on the Leadenhall Building it owns with Oxford Properties - commonly called the Cheesegrater. Part of one of the bolts fell to the ground, and the area has been cordoned off. On that note, it\u2019s time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow for the latest Bank of England and European Central Bank meetings. Over to Greece where leaders have emerged from talks saying tomorrow\u2019s eurogroup meeting of euro area finance ministers will be \u201cdecisive\u201d for the country\u2019s bid to exit its bailout programme. Helena Smith reports from Athens: Greece will come one step closer to ending the international scrutiny that has marked its relationship with foreign lenders when euro area finance ministers meet tomorrow. That was the message Evangelos Venizelos, the country\u2019s deputy premier and the finance minister Gikas Hardouvelis were determined to convey as both men talked up the prospect of an imminent agreement with creditors following talks with prime minister Antonis Samaras. \u201cIn January we are going [into a new phase],\u201d insisted Hardouvelis reminding reporters that as of December 31 EU bailout disbursements will stop. \u201cSo everyone has an incentive to go into a situation where everyone wins\u2026 the will is there, incentives are there and because incentives always work in life \u2026 a solution will be found.\u201d Tomorrow\u2019s eurogroup meeting will be crucial in determining negotiations that will mark the beginning of the end, Venizelos said. \u201cOur goal is to reach [a deal with foreign lenders] before the last eurogroup of the year which is 8 December. Thursday\u2019s meeting will be of decisive importance for the hard and delicate negotiations that the government is waging, \u201c he said adding that it was vital Greece exited the programme with the support needed to ensure that market volatility was kept at bay. The EU\u2019s new monetary affairs chief Pierre Moscovici has given the Greeks cause for optimism. Earlier this week he said the EU commission would study their \u201cevolving demand\u201d for an exit positively, provided that Greece also kept up with reforms. \u201cWe will have a first discussion on the euro group on Thursday, while decisions will be taken on December 8,\u201d he said announcing that his first foreign visit would be to Greece before then. Back in the US and Dallas Federal Reserve president Richard Fisher has been commenting on interest rates, and the mid-term elections. He has told Bloomberg TV that the Fed can\u2019t wait for inflation to reach its target before beginning to tighten monetary policy. He added that the Fed does not want to raise interest rates and then have to reverse course. He said: I would be very careful about waiting until we\u2019ve already achieved our targets and then trying to rein in by raising interest rates, because every time this has been done in the history of the Fed, to my knowledge, then we\u2019ve forced a recession. On the elections, dominated by the Republicans, he said he hoped the new Congress would limit any laws which might endanger the Fed\u2019s independence: I think it\u2019s very dangerous to tamper with the institution. Yes, we could be updated and tweaked but on balance we have lasted 100 years and on balance we have done a very good job. (Quotes from Reuters.) Reforms in Portugal have lost momentum, according to the latest review by teams from the European Commission and ECB which visited the country over the past few days. Its report said: Economic and financial conditions in Portugal have generally improved since the end of the EU/IMF-supported programme in June. Sovereign yields remain low, in line with developments elsewhere in the euro area and normal market-financing is being gradually restored. Nevertheless, economic recovery is constrained by high levels of debt in the public and private sector and by an increasingly weak external environment which highlights the need for further competitiveness gains. The pace of budgetary consolidation has been adversely affected by a series of one-off factors, despite strong revenue performance. Moreover, efforts to reduce the underlying structural budget deficit have clearly slackened. Progress in structural reforms has lost momentum, with an uneven pace of implementation across policy areas. The Portuguese banking sector continues to deleverage amid improving liquidity conditions. The results of the ECB\u2019s comprehensive assessment have generally confirmed the solvency of the sector, notwithstanding the recent resolution of BES. Yet, looking ahead it is important that the opportunity provided by the comprehensive assessment to strengthen further the resilience of the banking system as a whole is seized. While most banks still project losses in 2014, cost-saving measures are now beginning to yield positive results. However, future profitability remains challenging, not least in light of the domestic macroeconomic environment. The mission expressed concern that the pace of structural reform appears to have diminished considerably since the end of the programme, in some cases reversing past achievements. Notably, while it remains to be seen whether recent policy measures relating to collective wage bargaining could on balance contribute to a better alignment of wages to productivity developments, the decision to increase the minimum wage could make the transition into employment for the most vulnerable even more difficult. Moreover, efforts to reduce excessive rents in network industries, in particular in energy, need to be stepped up. The mission recalled the importance of increasing the flexibility and competitiveness of the Portuguese economy to underpin the still nascent economic recovery. It therefore urged the Government to maintain an ambitious reform agenda for the future. There is also a need to more systematically monitor and evaluate the impact of reforms. The ISM service sector survey may have fallen but it was still a strong outcome, said James Knightley of ING Bank, and could point to a stronger than expected non-farm number on Friday : The ISM non-manufacturing index was unable to replicate the surprise jump seen in the manufacturing index earlier this week. Instead it fell to 57.1 from 58.6 versus market expectations of 58.0. Nonetheless, this is still a very strong reading and the series continues to run well above its 12 month average and substantially above the 50 break-even level. Indeed, new orders remain close to 60, suggesting that business activity will remain robust through the quarter while the employment component rose to 59.6 from 58.5. This leaves that series at its highest level since August 2005 and is very positive news ahead of Friday\u2019s payrolls number. The current consensus for the change in non-farm payrolls is 235,000, but given the strength in the ISM employment indices, the ADP report and the consistently low readings for initial jobless claims then the odds favour a stronger outcome. And here\u2019s the ISM survey, also showing a slowdown in the pace of growth in October. The ISM services index fell from 58.6 in September to 57.1, lower than the expected 58 and falling to its lowest level since June. But the employment index rose to 59.6, the highest since August 2005, from 58.5. Here\u2019s the Markit composite PMI, showing the slowdown: And here\u2019s Markit. The final services sector purchasing managers index for October came in at 57.1, down from 58.9 in the previous month. This was its lowest level since April, and was slightly down on the preliminary reading of 57.3. And Markit\u2019s composite index, a weighted average of its manufacturing and services indices, fell to 57.2 in October from 59 in September. Markit said this suggested the brisk economic growth seen in the previous two quarters of the year would not be repeated in the final three months. Markit chief economist Chris Williamson said: The manufacturing and services surveys collectively indicated the slowest pace of expansion for six months in October and, with inflows of new business also hitting a six-month low, there\u2019s good reason to believe that the pace of growth could slacken further in coming months. The October survey data running at a level consistent with GDP rising at an annualised rate of 2.5% at the start of the fourth quarter, but any further drop in the PMI numbers raises the risk of an even sharper slowdown. However, although cooling, the pace of expansion clearly remains sufficiently strong to generate an impressive rate of job creation. The surveys are signalling another month of non-farm payroll growth in excess of 200,000 in October. The concern is that, with growth slowing and business confidence sliding to one of the lowest levels seen over the past two years, employers could soon start to show greater hesitancy in recruiting new staff. Coming up we have the latest from the US services sector, with two different measures from, first, Markit, then the Institute of Supply Management. If it is anything like Monday\u2019s two manufacturing surveys, they are not likely to agree, although they may at least head in the same direction this time. Meanwhile the Dow Jones Industrial Average hit yet another record high at the open, although it is currently off its best levels, up around 50 points. Time for a late lunchtime summary, before this afternoon\u2019s US data arrives (service PMIs from Markit and ISM). Economists have warned that Britain\u2019s economy is slowing, after the service sector recorded its weakest growth in 17 months. The services PMI fell to just 56.2, down from 58.7 in September. That is the lowest level since May 2013. Details start here. The pound hit a one-year low, with traders concluding that interest rates will remain at record lows for longer. Ranko Berich, Head of Market Analysis at Monex Europe, says the data shows the engine of UK economy has \u201cdropped down a gear\u201d Today\u2019s Service PMI is another nail in the coffin for the Bank of England\u2019s plan for early rate hikes, as the engine of the UK economy dropped down a gear in October. Services represented almost all of the third quarter growth in the UK and, should this crucial sector slow further, the economy as a whole could be heading for a fall. \u201cThere are some causes for optimism in the report, particularly the continued expansion of employment in the services sector, but the actual level of activity grew at the slowest pace in 17 months. There was also a notable fall in optimism, as businesses became increasingly concerned about future prospects for growth. With manufacturing looking sluggish and construction growth cooling, the signs look ominous for the wider economy. The eurozone\u2019s service sector has also recorded another tough month, with private sector activity only rising narrowly. Markit, which compiles the report, says it made for \u2018grim reading\u2019. France was, again, a weak performer, with service sector activity contracting at a faster pace. Italy returned to growth, but firms continued to cut jobs. MPs have warned that Rolls-Royce\u2019s plan to cut 2,600 jobs could have a serious negative impact on the UK economy, at an Urgent Question in parliament. Marks &amp; Spencer\u2019s shares have soared, up 8.5% at pixel time after it reported better than expected results and hiked its dividend. However the high street retailer also reported another quarter of falling clothing sales, which it partly blamed on the unusually warm UK weather this autumn. Ireland\u2019s unemployment rate has fallen to 11%.... ...while US firms created 230,000 new jobs last month. Today\u2019s drop in Ireland\u2019s unemployment rate to 11% (see 11.56am) has been hailed by Irish politicians as a sign of economic recovery. Henry McDonald, our Ireland correspondent, explains: Irish Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Social Protection Joan Burton said the latest figures indicated that progress was being made to reduce unemployment. \u201cThese are once again hugely encouraging figures, showing that the Pathways to Work strategy to reduce unemployment is making significant progress. In the first 9 months of this year, over 100,000 people have left the Live Register to take up employment. Unemployment is down from a crisis peak of 15.1 per cent to 11 per cent now, and, critically, the pace of the reduction is accelerating,\u201d she said. There was more good jobs news in Ireland today with the announcement of 200 extra posts at a U.S medical devices company in Co.Wexford, Henry adds: Clearstream Technologies based at Enniscorthy is expanding its operation in its southeast Ireland plant. It manufactures devices such as catheters and stents for uses in cancer treatments and major surgery. Over to America...and the latest ADP jobs report shows that US companies created 230,000 new jobs last month. That\u2019s up from 213,000 in September, suggesting that America\u2019s labour market improved again last month. However, there are signs that weaker conditions overseas hit job creation. Paul Dales of Capital Economics explains: The fact that, according to the ADP, large firms added just 4,000 jobs while small firms added 102,000 and medium firms added 122,000 could be a sign that the easing in global demand is hindering US employment. After all, large firms are more likely to be exposed to overseas developments. That said, the encouraging performance of small and medium firms supports our view that any weakening in demand from overseas is being offset by stronger demand at home. On Friday we get the eagerly awaited Non-Farm Payroll, showing how many new jobs were created across the whole economy (and whether earnings went up). Last question: Conservative MP Stephen Metcalfe asks the government to ensure that young people aren\u2019t deterred from entering engineering by the sight of Rolls-Royce cutting 2,600 jobs. Absolutely, BIS minister Matt Hancock replies. Engineering is an exciting profession, and a well-paid one too. Britain is a world career in engineering, and I\u2019d encourage anyone considering joining it to give serious consideration, he adds. And that\u2019s that. What impact will the Rolls-Royce job cuts have on the wider East Midlands economy? Matthew Hancock, minister for Business, Enterprise and Energy, agrees that \u201cWe need to take the impact on the supply chain into account\u201d. Hancock also says that the UK has a shortage of trained engineers -- the government will \u201cwork night and day\u201d to ensure that the people who leave Rolls-Royce can be redeployed. Another MP (sorry, missed his name) suggests that another UK engineering firm, Babcock, needs more engineering talent to handle future nuclear power work. Labour MP Jack Dromey says the government shouldn\u2019t simply accept Rolls-Royce\u2019s job cuts -- the consultation should consider whether the plan is right. Matt Hancock replies that RR faces a tough international market, and needs to make changes. The government will continue to engage with it. Conservative MP David Mowat asks whether the sanctions imposed on Russia have contributed to Rolls-Royce\u2019s jobs cuts. That hasn\u2019t come up in our talks, minister Hancock replies. Kerry McCarthy, Labour MP for Bristol East, is worried that new apprentices joining Rolls-Royce today will suffer as the company implements its job cuts plan. Adrian Bailey MP, who chairs the business, innovation and skills committee, is also concerned about the impact of Rolls-Royce\u2019s job cuts on Britain. We are desperately short of skilled engineers nationally...and short of young people entering the profession. And here we have a blue chip company actually laying people off, he says. Minister Matt Hancock replies that Rolls-Royce is still committed to taking on graduates and apprentices. Margaret Beckett, Labour MP for Derby South, warns parliament that Rolls-Royce\u2019s job cuts could hurt the wider UK economy by reducing the country\u2019s engineering talent base. Matt Hancock is telling MPs that we still don\u2019t know exactly where Rolls-Royce\u2019s 2,600 job cuts will fall. Heads-up. MPs in parliament are holding an urgent question on the 2,600 job cuts announced by Rolls-Royce yesterday. Minister Matthew Hancock is saying the government will do everything it can to help those affected, and will help set up a taskforce to help those affected. Many of the people hit by the layoffs will be engineers, he warns, adding: We are determined to help Rolls-Royce as they make the changes they need. Europe\u2019s stock markets are all up today, helped by better than expected results from Marks &amp; Spencer (see opening post) and German chemicals firm Brenntag (details). Traders also seem to be less fearful about yesterday\u2019s report of divisions at the top of the European Central Bank. Marks &amp; Spencer is the biggest gainer in London, up 9% today. But gold producer Randgold is the biggest faller, down 2.8%. Gold has fallen to a new four-year low, as my colleague Nick Fletcher reports: FTSE moves higher as Marks soars, but miner Randgold fails to shine Ireland\u2019s unemployment rate has dropped again, to 11% in October from 11.1% in September. The Irish central statistics body reports that that number of people receiving jobless benefits fell by 3,500 to 371,400 (seasonally adjusted). Ireland\u2019s labour market has strengthened since it exited its bailout last December. A year ago, its unemployment rate was 12.4%. But as this chart shows, most of the new jobs created have gone to men: Over in Athens, the race is on to get the troika back in town so that a deal can be cut on Greece\u2019s exit from its bailout programme. It is the main issue at talks between prime minister Antonis Samaras and his deputy Evangelos Venizelos taking place in Athens right now. From the Greek capital, Helena Smith reports: The two men hope by this evening to have wrapped up a plan that will entice international auditors back to Greece so that it can be presented by the Greek finance minister Gikas Hardouvelis at tomorrow\u2019s Eurogroup meeting. Officials here are saying they hope mission heads representing the EU, ECB and IMF will return next week \u201cin order for negotiations to finally begin.\u201d Greek government sources, who I spoke to this morning, have been emboldened by an array of encouraging noises made by top EU officials, including the German chancellor Angela Merkel, that suggest Athens\u2019 bailout programme is coming to an end - even if a precautionary credit line will still be needed. In his first TV interview since assuming the post, Hardouvelis announced that Greece was on the way to forming a \u201cnew kind of relationship\u201d with lenders. \u201cThis new relationship will be an issue of negotiation,\u201d he told Mega TV. As of 2015, the troika would not have such an active role in the day-to-day running of affairs even if \u201cthe relationship with lenders will last many years until we pay back 75 percent of the loan.\u201d Yet more gloomy news -- eurozone retail spending has taken quite a tumble, highlighting the weakness of the Europe economy. Retail sales volumes across the eurozone slid by 1.3% month-on-month in September, a rather bigger decline than expected. It\u2019s the biggest monthly decline since April 2012. Non-food spending shrank by 2.2%, while food spending was 0.1% lower. Eurostat adds that: The highest increases in total retail trade were registered in Malta (+1.0%), Luxembourg (+0.9%), Hungary and Slovakia (both +0.7%), and the largest decreases in Germany (-3.2%), Portugal (-2.5%) and Poland (-2.4%). Martin Beck, senior economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club, agrees that the UK growth rate appears to be dipping, given today\u2019s drop in service sector growth. \u201cIt appears that some of the clouds that have been lingering over the manufacturing sector in recent months have now started to cast a shadow over services as well. A weaker new business pipeline and softer confidence is likely to reflect heightened concerns about global economic and geopolitical risk. \u201cThese results are consistent with our long-held view that the pace of growth will cool a little around the turn of the year. Update, the pound actually hit a one-year low against the US dollar this morning. Sterling fell as low as $1.5867 after October\u2019s service sector PMI came in weaker than expected, below the previous 11-month low set in mid-October. Britain\u2019s service sector firms probably suffered a knock-on effect from the stock market volatility in October, says Rob Wood, economist at Berenberg bank. Wood points out that a service sector PMI of 56.2 is still quite strong (50 is the cut-off point between expansion and contraction). But... That being said, for now we have to get used to more average rather than spectacular PMI readings. Firm\u2019s expectations for growth over the next twelve months, a decent leading indicator, are a little below their historical average. Wood also reckons that domestic politics could be the biggest threat to the economy next year: With UKIP\u2019s surge prompting the Conservative\u2019s to consider more extreme immigration policies and Labour seemingly suffering an implosion of support in Scotland, the chances of an unstable government after the May-2015 election seem to be rising, as is the chance of Brexit. We do not expect doomsday scenarios to come to pass \u2013 we expect the UK to remain in the EU and a stable coalition government to emerge after the 2015 election \u2013 but those political risks are worth watching very carefully. Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight is also unimpressed by today\u2019s UK service sector PMI: This is a relatively disappointing survey adding to the recent evidence that both the dominant services sector and the economy overall has come off the boil. The UK services sector is entering the winter lacking the self-belief that it exhibited earlier in this year, says Jeremy Cook of World First, the currency exchange firm. \u201cAlthough new business measures increased, this rate has fallen. Combined with slower demand growth from respondents, there is a new unease in the services sector as to where the industry moves from here.\u201d The pound has fallen to a two-week low, following the weaker-than-expected service sector report. It has lost a cent against the US dollar this morning, to $1.5887 Traders are calculating that there\u2019s even less chance of the Bank of England rushing to raise interest rates at this month\u2019s two-day meeting, which began this morning. City economists aren\u2019t panicking about the UK service sector slowdown. Here\u2019s some instant reaction: More disappointing data! Growth in the UK\u2019s service sector dropped sharply in October, according to Markit\u2019s survey of the sector. That suggesting Britain\u2019s economic growth is slowing as 2014 comes to a close. The UK service sector PMI fell to 56.2 in October, down from 58.7 in September. That indicates the slowest monthly growth in 17 months. Markit reports that UK business confidence weakened slightly last month - although firms did also keep hiring staff. It\u2019s not a reason to panic -- any reading over 50 shows growth. But Chris Williamson, Markit\u2019s chief economist, says that \u201c a cloud of uncertainty\u201d has gathered over the UK economy in recent weeks. Although manufacturing growth picked up (details), construction growth slowed (details) He reckons that UK GDP may only rise by 0.5% in the final three months of this year, down from 0.7% in the July-September quarter. Here\u2019s why: \u201cA sharp easing of service sector growth to the weakest since May of last year comes on the heels of data showing construction growth sliding to a five-month low and the goods-producing sector shifting down a gear since earlier in the year. \u201cAfter GDP growth slowed to 0.7% in the third quarter, a 0.5% expansion is currently being signalled by the surveys for the fourth quarter. However, with inflows of work rising across all three sectors at the slowest rate for 16 months, there is a risk that economic growth could weaken further. And David Noble, CEO of the Chartered Institute of Purchasing &amp; Supply, says UK firms are \u201ctiptoeing through a time of uncertainty\u201d. \u201cThis month appears to be a slowdown month as the services sector comes off the boil, challenged by capacity constraints, increased backlogs and a slight reduction in new business growth. Credit Agricole economist Frederik Ducrozet remains hopeful that the eurozone economy will pick up next year, despite struggling last month. It\u2019s official: Eurozone economy remains weak, dragged back by weak demand and renewed job losses among companies. That\u2019s the conclusion of this morning\u2019s service sector data (details start here), and Monday manufacturing PMIs. Markit, which conducts the polls of eurozone firms, says: The rate of economic expansion in October was little-changed from September\u2019s ten-month low, with modest output growth registered at manufacturers and service providers alike. Job losses were reported for the first time since November 2013, while price pressures remained muted. Markit\u2019s composite PMI, measuring activity across the eurozone private sector, inched up to 52.1, up from 52.0 in September. That shows modest growth, but not enough to drag the economy out of its rut. Firms reported that they cut jobs because new work rose at a slower pace, meaning backlogs of work fell for the fifth month running. And France is a big worry - as covered earlier, the contraction in its service sector accelerated to a four-month low. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, says the PMIs suggest the fragile eurozone economy could worsen in the months ahead. That raises the threat of a recession -- the third since the financial crisis began. Williamson explains: \u201cThe eurozone PMI makes for grim reading, painting a picture of an economy that is limping along and more likely to take a turn for the worse than spring back into life. While output grew at a slightly faster rate than in September, consistent with quarterly GDP growth of 0.2%, a near- stagnation of new orders, with the worst reading for 15 months, suggests that the pace of growth may deteriorate in coming months. \u201cA fall in employment for the first time since November casts a further cloud over the outlook. Firms are often being forced to cut employment due to squeezed profits margins. Input costs are rising but prices charged for goods and services have fallen almost continually over the past three years, with the rate of decline accelerating to the fastest seen over this period in October as companies increasingly turn to discounting to help boost sales.\u201d Germany\u2019s service sector grew at its slowest pace in six months, Markit says. Its service sector PMI dropped to 54.4 in October, down from 55.7 -- showing that growth slowed last month. Markit also found that sentiment among German service sector firms hit a 22-month low. Oliver Kolodseike, economist at Markit, says that: Companies are worried about the introduction of a national minimum wage in January 2015, a general economic slowdown and sluggish new order growth. Bad news from France -- its service sector has shrunk again, with activity shrinking at the fastest pace in four months. New business declined at the sharpest rate since August 2013. And staffing levels in the French private sector fell again, for the twelfth month running This meant that Markit\u2019s Services PMI fell to 48.3, down from 48.4 in September, showing activity shrank at a slightly faster rate. Markit paints a grim picture: The performance of France\u2019s service sector worsened further in October. Activity contracted for a second successive month, reflecting a steeper reduction in new business. Backlogs of work declined, while firms continued to cut staffing levels. Output prices decreased at the steepest rate in five years, in contrast to a further rise in input costs. Business expectations remained historically muted. Full report here. Back to the eurozone.... and Italy\u2019s service sector has returned to growth, but firms are still laying off staff. The monthly Italian services PMI, calculated by data firm Markit, rose to 50.8 in October, up from 48.8 in September. Any reading over 50 shows growth. Markit found that business activity at Italian service providers rose slightly in October, but: employment in the sector returned to contraction after having held steady during September. Business confidence also fell. Although still positive, sentiment was the weakest in almost a year, having eased for the third time in four months Back to M&amp;S briefly.... chief executive Marc Bolland has told reporters that sales in October weren\u2019t as badly hit by the weather. He\u2019s also upbeat about Christmas trading: MARKS &amp; SPENCER CEO SAYS \u201cSIGNS ARE POSITIVE\u201d TURNAROUND PLAN IS WORKING MARKS &amp; SPENCER CEO SAYS \u201cBETTER SET UP FOR XMAS THAN EVER BEFORE\u201d Over to the eurozone, and Spain\u2019s service sector has posted its 12th month of consecutive growth, as it continues to recover (slowly) from the eurozone crisis. The Spanish PMI, which measures activity across the sector, rose to 55.9 in October from 55.8 in September. Firms reported that output and new business rose a little, and hired more workers. Andrew Harker, senior economist at Markit, says: \u201cThe twelfth successive rise in activity during October means that the Spanish service sector has been able to sustain growth for a year for the first time since 2007, and with the expansion in new business picking up the recovery looks set to continue in the near-term at least. The rate of job creation was weak, but the return to hiring after employment stabilised in September provides some reassurance.\u201d The full report was here. Richard Hunter, Head of Equities at Hargreaves Lansdown Stockbrokers, reckons that Marks &amp; Spencer is still a \u201cwork in progress\u201d. He\u2019s impressed, though, that the company managed to grow profits and gross margins despite the warm autumn (apparently) hitting clothing sales. \u201cThe profit beat and improvement to gross margins have taken investors by surprise, with the share price strongly ahead in early trade. Even so, with General Merchandising sales down, food sales up and online yet to gain traction, the summary is a familiar one, even if the initial share price reaction may suggest some optimism on prospects.\u201d ZING. Marks &amp; Spencer shares have jumped by over 7% at the start of trading in London, to 432p. Investors are cheered that the company has raised its interim dividend by 3.2% (details), after increasing its underlying profits by 2.3%. Veteran City commentator David Buik says that M&amp;S\u2019s results (details start here) were \u201cnot quite as bad as expected\u201d. It\u2019s not all bad news from Marks &amp; Spencer this morning -- the company is handing more cash than back to shareholders. M&amp;S has raised its interim dividend for the first time in several years, by 0.2p to 6.4p per share. This reflects the fact that underlying pre-tax profits rose by 2.3% in the six months to end-September, despite the latest fall in clothing and general merchandise sales. Retail analyst Nick Bubb reckons M&amp;S shares should rally when the stock market opens. Boom boom Some instant reaction: M&amp;S is planning to build on its success in food, by opening 200 more Simply Food stores over the next three years -- up from 150 previously. M&amp;S also warns that geopolitical issues, and foreign exchange movements, have hurt trading overseas: In our International business, we have delivered sales and profit growth in our Owned business, despite currency headwinds and unseasonal conditions across Europe. However, our Franchise business has been impacted by currency and political issues in our Middle East region and lower shipments, which we expect to continue into the second half of this year. On a happier note, its standalone Food stores in Paris and Hong Kong have performed \u201cstrongly\u201d. Marks &amp; Spencer has become the latest UK retailer to warn that the unseasonably warm UK weather has hit trading. The high street chain just reported that clothing and general merchandise sales fell again in the last six months. Clothing sales have now fallen, on a like-for-like basis, for the last 13 quarters in a row! M&amp;S\u2019s like-for-like general merchandise (GM) sales fell by 2.9% in the six months to the end of September. The decline accelerated as warm weather deterred customers from splashing out on autumn clothing. Those \u201cunseasonal conditions in September\u201d knocked 2.5% off its GM sales during the month. Fellow retailers SuperGroup and Next have already warned that the hot weather has hurt trading. Overall like-for-like sales in the UK are down by 0.7% during the last six months, with food sales outperforming as usual, up 1%. Marc Bolland, chief executive, is still upbeat: \u201cM&amp;S delivered sales growth and increased profit in the first half despite a tough market, particularly in September. We are pleased with the progress we have made against our key priorities for the year: GM gross margin, improving Womenswear, driving Food growth and Cash generation.\u201d Here\u2019s the details: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, business and the eurozone. Coming up today.... Financial results from Marks &amp; Spencer -- city investors, and the army of M&amp;S small shareholders, will be taking a close look to see how the high street veteran performed. After several years of declining profits, the pressure is building on CEO Marc Bolland: In the economic sphere, we get new surveys of Europe\u2019s service sector. These purchasing managers indexes (PMI) are likely to show contractions in Italy and France, but growth in Germany and Spain, and the UK. We\u2019ll also be digesting yesterday\u2019s news that a bunch of eurozone central bankers are losing patience with ECB president Mario Draghi. In case you missed it, Reuters reported that.... National central bankers in the euro area plan to challenge European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi on Wednesday over what they see as his secretive management style and erratic communication and will urge him to act more collegially, ECB sources said. They\u2019re also unhappy that Draghi (apparently) faffs around with his phone rather than listening to their pearls of wisdom: \u201cHe sits there with these three mobile phones in front of him and sometimes he\u2019s sending text messages or going out to make or take phone calls,\u201d one source usually in the room said. On at least one occasion, a national governor has skipped his turn to speak because Draghi was not present. \u201cThis has got a bit better. He\u2019s paying a bit more attention now,\u201d the source said.

Sovereign yields remain low, in line with developments elsewhere in the euro area and normal market-financing is being gradually restored.</p> <p>Nevertheless, economic recovery is constrained by high levels of debt in the public and private sector and by an increasingly weak external environment which highlights the need for further competitiveness gains. The pace of budgetary consolidation has been adversely affected by a series of one-off factors, despite strong revenue performance. Moreover, efforts to reduce the underlying structural budget deficit have clearly slackened. Progress in structural reforms has lost momentum, with an uneven pace of implementation across policy areas.</p> <p>The Portuguese banking sector continues to deleverage amid improving liquidity conditions. The results of the ECB\u2019s comprehensive assessment have generally confirmed the solvency of the sector, notwithstanding the recent resolution of BES. Yet, looking ahead it is important that the opportunity provided by the comprehensive assessment to strengthen further the resilience of the banking system as a whole is seized. While most banks still project losses in 2014, cost-saving measures are now beginning to yield positive results. However, future profitability remains challenging, not least in light of the domestic macroeconomic environment.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9416f4831141e6022882690d81cf5029e00d161d\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/5/1415202499497/3eec89c9-b97d-4b39-a90e-a1ab997f02e1-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"A Portuguese employment office in Lisbon.

Notably, while it remains to be seen whether recent policy measures relating to collective wage bargaining could on balance contribute to a better alignment of wages to productivity developments, the decision to increase the minimum wage could make the transition into employment for the most vulnerable even more difficult. Moreover, efforts to reduce excessive rents in network industries, in particular in energy, need to be stepped up. The mission recalled the importance of increasing the flexibility and competitiveness of the Portuguese economy to underpin the still nascent economic recovery.

Markit chief economist Chris Williamson said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The manufacturing and services surveys collectively indicated the slowest pace of expansion for six months in October and, with inflows of new business also hitting a six-month low, there\u2019s good reason to believe that the pace of growth could slacken further in coming months.</p> <p>The October survey data running at a level consistent with GDP rising at an annualised rate of 2.5% at the start of the fourth quarter, but any further drop in the PMI numbers raises the risk of an even sharper slowdown. </p> <p>However, although cooling, the pace of expansion clearly remains sufficiently strong to generate an impressive rate of job creation. The surveys are signalling another month of non-farm payroll growth in excess of 200,000 in October. The concern is that, with growth slowing and business confidence sliding to one of the lowest levels seen over the past two years, employers could soon start to show greater hesitancy in recruiting new staff.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2014-11-05T15:49:30.646Z\">at 3.49pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-545a3650e4b0657751e65ba9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-11-05T14:42:21.408Z\">2.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Coming up we have the latest from the US services sector, </strong>with two different measures from, first, Markit, then the Institute of Supply Management.

Rival <strong>Next</strong> rose 65p to \u00a365.05 and Primark owner <strong>Associated British Foods</strong> added 159p to \u00a329.42.</p> <p>Oil shares recovered after their recent slippage as crude prices headed higher, with Brent up 1% to $83.73 a barrel, helped by reports of a possible pipeline fire in Saudi Arabia and a surprise drop in US oil stocks.</p> <p><strong>Royal Dutch Shell</strong> B shares rose 39p to \u00a322.59 and <strong>BP</strong> was 9.75p better at 440.15p. </p> <p>But precious metal miners fell back as gold fell for the fifth session out of six, down to fresh four year lows as the strong dollar put investors off.

The timing of each sudden plunge in gold prices is highly correlated with moves higher in the US dollar.</p> </blockquote> <p>So <strong>Randgold Resources</strong> dropped 40p to \u00a337.65 and <strong>Fresnillo</strong> fell 13p to 684.5p.</p> <p>Among the mid-caps <strong>JD Wetherspoon</strong> was 34p lower at 798p as the pub owner reported a 6.3% rise in first quarter underlying sales but said growth had slowed in October. Operating margins of 7.7% were at the bottom end of previous guidance of 7.7% to 8.1%, and rising costs and the October slowdown have led to the company cutting the full year range to 7.2% to 7.8%.

      "bodyText": "Leading shares took off like a rocket on bonfire night, as positive company updates outweighed another fall in precious metal miners. Ahead of this week\u2019s meetings of the Bank of England and European Central Bank and Friday\u2019s US jobs data, the FTSE 100 finished 85.17 points higher at 6539.14. The mood was helped by Wall Street climbing to a record high in early trading after the Republican victory in the US mid-term elections and strong private sector job growth in October according to payroll processor ADP. Back in the UK, Marks &amp; Spencer soared 39.4p to 444.1p or nearly 10% after better than expected results. Rival Next rose 65p to \u00a365.05 and Primark owner Associated British Foods added 159p to \u00a329.42. Oil shares recovered after their recent slippage as crude prices headed higher, with Brent up 1% to $83.73 a barrel, helped by reports of a possible pipeline fire in Saudi Arabia and a surprise drop in US oil stocks. Royal Dutch Shell B shares rose 39p to \u00a322.59 and BP was 9.75p better at 440.15p. But precious metal miners fell back as gold fell for the fifth session out of six, down to fresh four year lows as the strong dollar put investors off. Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: Since falling below $1,220 the trend appears to be characterised by sudden $20 drops before consolidating. The fundamental reason for the weakness in gold, namely the prospect of higher interest rates in the US has not changed. The timing of each sudden plunge in gold prices is highly correlated with moves higher in the US dollar. So Randgold Resources dropped 40p to \u00a337.65 and Fresnillo fell 13p to 684.5p. Among the mid-caps JD Wetherspoon was 34p lower at 798p as the pub owner reported a 6.3% rise in first quarter underlying sales but said growth had slowed in October. Operating margins of 7.7% were at the bottom end of previous guidance of 7.7% to 8.1%, and rising costs and the October slowdown have led to the company cutting the full year range to 7.2% to 7.8%. Nick Batram at Peel Hunt said: While the top line continued to deliver, it is once again at the cost of margins. Full-year margin guidance has been lowered once again and the hoped-for stability continues to prove elusive. The commitment to the consumer proposition is to be admired but, with no sign of margin stability and subsequently falling returns, the shares will find it difficult to outperform. The decline in margins in the first quarter was driven by a combination of labour costs (hourly staff rates increased by 5%), utility costs (up 4%), and there have also been some increases in prices from suppliers. The company continues to invest heavily in the business and ultimately believes that this will see improved returns, something that has yet to occur.",

Cutting the bank\u2019s recommendation from buy to hold in a note entitled (wait for it) <em>Throwing in the trowel</em>, analyst Warwick Okines said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Kingfisher reports its third quarter on 25 November. Weak end markets and negative currency continue to weight on earnings and we expect third quarter retail profit of \u00a3227m, an 11% decline compared with last year. Moreover the comparison base gets progressively more challenging in the fourth quarter and the first quarter [next year], with no obvious respite from the consumer. We lower current year forecasts by 3.4% and sit 5% below consensus. There are self-help opportunities ahead but also challenges, and while earnings momentum remains negative we downgrade to hold.</p> <p>Kingfisher shares are unchanged from its B&amp;Q investor day [in October], and we have taken time to reflect on what we learnt. Under a new chief executive we hope for a reinvigorated sourcing and gross margin drive, potential China exit, and continued share buyback. B&amp;Q is on the right strategic path and the Mr Bricolage acquisition [in France] should represent 15% of profit growth next year. Yet it will not be until the end of March that we hear more and in the meantime see macro risks from the consumer and currency. The stock trades on 2015 PE of 12 times which is not demanding but we see limited positive catalysts in the coming months. </p> </blockquote> <p>Kingfisher is currently one of the biggest fallers in the FTSE 100, down 5.1p to 288.2p.</p> <p>But it is not all downbeat in the building supplies sector. <strong>Howden Joinery</strong>, which supplies kitchen and joinery products to trade builders through 580 depots, has said it expects full year profits to be above market expectations of \u00a3161m to \u00a3172m after a strong performance in the second half of the year, particularly in October. Total revenue in the second half rose by 16.2%, and margins were in line with expectations.

      "bodyText": "B&amp;Q owner Kingfisher is under pressure on concerns about weak consumer demand, amid talk that people are falling out of love with DIY. Last month Homebase announced the closure of a quarter of its stores, and now Deutsche Bank has turned more negative on Kingfisher. Cutting the bank\u2019s recommendation from buy to hold in a note entitled (wait for it) Throwing in the trowel, analyst Warwick Okines said: Kingfisher reports its third quarter on 25 November. Weak end markets and negative currency continue to weight on earnings and we expect third quarter retail profit of \u00a3227m, an 11% decline compared with last year. Moreover the comparison base gets progressively more challenging in the fourth quarter and the first quarter [next year], with no obvious respite from the consumer. We lower current year forecasts by 3.4% and sit 5% below consensus. There are self-help opportunities ahead but also challenges, and while earnings momentum remains negative we downgrade to hold. Kingfisher shares are unchanged from its B&amp;Q investor day [in October], and we have taken time to reflect on what we learnt. Under a new chief executive we hope for a reinvigorated sourcing and gross margin drive, potential China exit, and continued share buyback. B&amp;Q is on the right strategic path and the Mr Bricolage acquisition [in France] should represent 15% of profit growth next year. Yet it will not be until the end of March that we hear more and in the meantime see macro risks from the consumer and currency. The stock trades on 2015 PE of 12 times which is not demanding but we see limited positive catalysts in the coming months. Kingfisher is currently one of the biggest fallers in the FTSE 100, down 5.1p to 288.2p. But it is not all downbeat in the building supplies sector. Howden Joinery, which supplies kitchen and joinery products to trade builders through 580 depots, has said it expects full year profits to be above market expectations of \u00a3161m to \u00a3172m after a strong performance in the second half of the year, particularly in October. Total revenue in the second half rose by 16.2%, and margins were in line with expectations. Peel Hunt said: We have upgraded our pretax profit forecasts for 2014 to 16 by 5%-7%. Cash generation remains strong and we expect special dividends to match ordinary dividend payments over our forecast period. We maintain our buy recommendation and increase our target price to 405p. Howden is currently up 23.6p to 366.5p.",

Turning round such a venerable brand burdened with so many legacy problems was always going to be like altering course in an oil tanker. But [chief executive] Marc Bolland may have done just enough to avoid the rocks \u2013 for now. Yet the contrast between the fortunes of M&amp;S\u2019 food and clothes ranges is getting starker by the day. Its well-presented, well-marketed and professional-friendly food ranges provide the sole bright point in some otherwise grim results. No amount of hand-wringing about September\u2019s unseasonal weather can explain away such weak clothing sales across the six-month period. Louise Cooper at Cooper City sees \u201ca great growth story\u201d in the food business. This is an extraordinary performance given the chaos amongst the other players in the UK sector. Food is actually a bigger part of the business than clothing. Food sales were \u00a32.4bn in the [first half of the M&amp;S financial year] and general merchandise (mainly clothing) \u00a31.9bn.

Mike van Dulken at Accendo Markets, explains why investors have been buying M&amp;S shares, despite the falling sales. Shareholders are stocking up on Marks &amp; Spencer shares this morning, sending them to the top of FTSE100 with gains of +6.3% ... The jump comes on the back of first-half results to end September which delivered a surprise rise in underlying profits (the first such jump in four years) on improved profit margins and better performance from food which has offset the still ugly 13 consecutive quarterly falls in underlying sales, echoing peers with a negative impact on the recent autumn/winter clothing sales from unseasonably warm UK weather. Retail Week editor George MacDonald points out that M&amp;S exceeded the City\u2019s expectations. For Richard Hunter at Hargreaves Lansdown stockbrokers, M&amp;S\u2019s recovery is \u201cstill a work in progress\u201d. [The better than expected profit] and improvement to gross margins have taken investors by surprise, with the share price strongly ahead in early trade. Even so, with general merchandising sales down, food sales up and online yet to gain traction, the summary is a familiar one, even if the initial share price reaction may suggest some optimism on prospects. Unseasonal weather conditions have inevitably been mentioned [by M&amp;S], along with currency headwinds and a cautious near-term outlook.

      "bodyText": "Shares in Marks &amp; Spencer soared on Wednesday as long-suffering investors glimpsed chinks of light at the end of the tunnel after the high street retailer reported its first increase in profits in four years and lifted its dividend. The stock jumped nearly 10% after the City shrugged off the retailer\u2019s 13th quarter of declining clothing sales, reassured by chief executive Marc Bolland\u2019s promise that it was making a bigger profit on the fashion it did actually sell after striking better deals with suppliers and cutting back on store discounts. After four years in charge Bolland refused to hail a recovery but pointed to \u201cencouraging\u201d signs, especially in its key womenswear department. \u201cWe could certainly see positive signs if we look at the womenswear trend,\u201d he said. \u201cConsumers are coming back to us and saying: \u2018M&amp;S has got the style back.\u2019\u201d But he admitted the balmy autumn had brought to an end a nascent resurgence in womenswear. Like-for-like sales growth of 0.7% for the first five months of the period wilted in September as shoppers shunned new ranges of winter coats, jackets and boots. The collapse in trade during September \u2013 which forced rival Next to issue a profit warning last week \u2013 meant underlying womenswear sales at M&amp;S ended up falling almost 1% over the six months to 27 September. Overall UK like-for-like sales of general merchandise, which includes clothing and homewares, fell 4% in the second quarter. Bolland said the weather meant the retailer was now sitting on a bit more stock than expected but insisted there was \u201cno massive overhang\u201d. He also voiced confidence that sales would pick up as temperatures start falling: \u201cWe are able to trade it well if we see the weather turning.\u201d The sales picture was not helped by a slump of more than 6% at M&amp;S.com as customers struggled to get the hang of its new \u00a3150m magazine-style website. Close to five million customers have registered on the company-owned site but that is shy of the six million that logged on to the previous one run by Amazon. Bolland said sales had now stabilised at the site and he expected them to be growing again before Christmas. Despite the various challenges, the group surprised the City by reporting a rise in underlying first-half profits, up 2.3% to \u00a3268m, thanks to higher margins and lower costs. It is also increasing its dividend payment to shareholders for the first time since 2010, with an interim payment of 6.4p, up from 6.2p. The shares closed up 39.4p at 444.1p. M&amp;S said it had managed to boost clothing profit margins by buying fabric from fewer places and getting existing suppliers to move production to lower-cost countries. Bolland gave the example of buying linen from eight \u2013 rather than 28 \u2013 mills, and promised bigger gains in the second half. The drive to improve clothing profit margins would not compromise M&amp;S\u2019s ethical sourcing policies, he insisted. The most recent clothing collections have been well received by the fashion press with the retailer now changing over the ranges in its stores more frequently and promising that clothes featured in its adverts can actually be found in branches all over the country. Bolland brought in a new design team two years ago fronted by former Debenhams chief executive Belinda Earl as style director in response to criticism that the clothes were too frumpy. Last winter a much-hyped pink coat modelled by Karen Elson sold out within days, leaving the company under fire for advertising items only available in a few flagship stores.

Like-for-like sales rose 1% aided by a stream of new product launches including ready meals and frozen foods. That figure was a slight slowdown but it is still judged to be a good outcome in a sluggish grocery market and the retailer has upped its expansion plans to 200 standalone Simply Food stores. \u201cWe feel that M&amp;S may have finally turned a corner,\u201d said Jefferies analyst Caroline Gulliver, pointing to M&amp;S\u2019s apparent confidence in both its UK clothing and food ranges as well as the website\u2019s improvements. \u201cOverall it seems M&amp;S could finally be moving in the right direction.\u201d Bolland, poached from grocer Morrisons with great fanfare in 2010, has spent more than \u00a32.3bn addressing decades of underinvestment, overseeing the revamp of its products, stores, website, logistics and marketing.

While market conditions remain \u201cchallenging\u201d Bolland appeared upbeat before the key Christmas trading period. \u201cCustomers are telling us there\u2019s some money to be spent over Christmas and that they are interested in something new. They don\u2019t want to reuse the same Christmas decorations or hold back on gifting, because they can afford to spend a bit more.\u201d M&amp;S food: a global brand? With its gastropub-style ready meals, shortbread fingers and bottles of prosecco, M&amp;S\u2019s food business is the national flag carrier for Britain\u2019s favourite treats and tipples. In recent years the retailer has become more ambitious with its foreign postings, with new stores in Hong Kong the most exotic on a list that has also included openings in Paris and Prague over the last six months. M&amp;S has operated a small chain of predominantly clothing shops in Hong Kong since 1988 but upped the ante with its two standalone food store openings. Food parcels of cheddar cheese and ready meals are flown in regularly on Virgin airliners while shorter shelf-life foods such as sandwiches and salads are sourced locally. Surprise bestsellers there include redcurrant puffs, custard creams, shortbread fingers and wine gums, according to the retailer. City analyst Louise Cooper sees huge potential for the M&amp;S food brand overseas: \u201cM&amp;S has positioned itself as the Heston Blumenthal of food retailing. It could be a global brand like Starbucks.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Shares in Marks &amp; Spencer soared on Wednesday as long-suffering investors glimpsed chinks of light at the end of the tunnel after the high street retailer reported its first increase in profits in four years and lifted its dividend.</p> <p>The stock jumped nearly 10% after the City shrugged off the retailer\u2019s 13th quarter of declining clothing sales, reassured by chief executive Marc Bolland\u2019s promise that it was making a bigger profit on the fashion it did actually sell after striking better deals with suppliers and cutting back on store discounts.</p> <p>After four years in charge Bolland refused to hail a recovery but pointed to \u201cencouraging\u201d signs, especially in its key womenswear department. \u201cWe could certainly see positive signs if we look at the womenswear trend,\u201d he said. \u201cConsumers are coming back to us and saying: \u2018M&amp;S has got the style back.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>But he admitted the balmy autumn had brought to an end a nascent resurgence in womenswear. Like-for-like sales growth of 0.7% for the first five months of the period wilted in September as shoppers shunned new ranges of winter coats, jackets and boots. The collapse in trade during September \u2013 which <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/oct/29/next-cuts-profit-expectations-warm-weather-shoppers\" title=\"\">forced rival Next to issue a profit warning last week</a> \u2013 meant underlying womenswear sales at M&amp;S ended up falling almost 1% over the six months to 27 September. Overall UK like-for-like sales of general merchandise, which includes clothing and homewares, fell 4% in the second quarter.</p> <p>Bolland said the weather meant the retailer was now sitting on a bit more stock than expected but insisted there was \u201cno massive overhang\u201d. He also voiced confidence that sales would pick up as temperatures start falling: \u201cWe are able to trade it well if we see the weather turning.\u201d</p> <p>The sales picture was not helped by a slump of more than 6% at M&amp;S.com as customers struggled to get the hang of its new \u00a3150m magazine-style website. Close to five million customers have registered on the company-owned site but that is shy of the six million that logged on to the previous one run by Amazon. Bolland said sales had now stabilised at the site and he expected them to be growing again before Christmas.</p> <p>Despite the various challenges, the group surprised the City by reporting a rise in underlying first-half profits, up 2.3% to \u00a3268m, thanks to higher margins and lower costs. It is also increasing its dividend payment to shareholders for the first time since 2010, with an interim payment of 6.4p, up from 6.2p. The shares closed up 39.4p at 444.1p.</p> <p>M&amp;S said it had managed to boost clothing profit margins by buying fabric from fewer places and getting existing suppliers to move production to lower-cost countries. Bolland gave the example of buying linen from eight \u2013 rather than 28 \u2013 mills, and promised bigger gains in the second half. The drive to improve clothing profit margins would not compromise M&amp;S\u2019s ethical sourcing policies, he insisted.</p> <p>The most recent clothing collections have been well received by the fashion press with the retailer now changing over the ranges in its stores more frequently and promising that clothes featured in its adverts can actually be found in branches all over the country.

The business secretary is pledging \u00a350m to seven new areas of technology where the government thinks Britain could take a leading role, such as the 3D printing of human organs. The government will also unveil \u00a317m of funding for up to 210 industrial PhDs, that it hopes will forge closer ties between business and academia.

      "bodyText": "The number of people living in dire poverty in Britain is 300,000 more than previously thought due to poorer households facing a higher cost of living than the well off, according to a study released on Wednesday. A report produced by the Institute for Fiscal Studies found that soaring prices for food and fuel over the past decade have had a bigger impact on struggling families who spend more of their budgets on staple goods. By contrast, richer households had been the beneficiaries of the drop in mortgage rates and lower motoring costs. The study by the IFS for the Joseph Rowntree Foundation said the government method for calculating absolute poverty \u2013 the number of people living below a breadline that rises each year in line with the cost of living \u2013 assumed that all households faced the same inflation rate. But in the six years from early 2008 to early 2014, the cost of energy had risen by 67% and the cost of food by 32%. Over the same period the retail prices index \u2013 a measure of the cost of a basket of goods and services \u2013 had gone up by 22%. The IFS report said the poorest 20% of households spent 8% of their budgets on energy and 20% on food, while the richest 20% spent 4% on energy and 11% on food. Poorer households allocated 3% of their budgets to mortgage interest payments, which have fallen by 40% since 2008 due to the cut in official interest from 5% to 0.5%. Richer households spend 8% of their budgets on servicing home loans. As a result, the IFS concluded that since 2008-09 the annual inflation rate faced by the poorest 20% had been higher than it was for the richest 20% of households. That meant the official measure of absolute poverty understated the figure by 0.5% \u2013 or 300,000. The report said, however, that poverty had not been systematically understated, and that in earlier years absolute poverty would have been lower using its new definition based on the different inflation rates facing rich and poor. Peter Levell, a Research Economist at IFS said \u201cIn recent years, lower income households have tended to see bigger increases in their cost of living than have better off households. Official poverty measures do not take this into account and hence have arguably understated recent increases in absolute poverty by a small but not insignificant margin.\u201d Responding to the IFS research, Katie Schmuecker, policy and research manager at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, said: \u201cCosts rising faster than earnings causes problems for us all, but it is the poorest families who have faced the greatest pressure from rising prices over the past decade. Any plans at the next election to help improve family living standards must get to grips the high cost of essentials, as well as how to boost wages and incomes. \u201cThe Living Wage \u2013 which recognises the cost of essentials in how it is calculated \u2013 is an important part of the answer, especially for the 5.2 million workers who earn below this rate. But it must be complemented by a wider strategy that includes measures to address the cost of essential goods and services, the nature of work at the bottom end of the labour market and how well the tax and benefit system work. Otherwise millions of struggling households will find it even harder to make ends meet \u2013 even as the economy recovers.\u201d",
