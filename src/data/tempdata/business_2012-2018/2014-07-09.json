      "bodyText": "Tough talk from the Bank of England over the threat of a housing bubble and the tightening of lending rules helped dampen the buoyant housing market last month, according to estate agents. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) said the London property market was particularly affected by a heightened sense of caution following a strong signal from the Bank's governor, Mark Carney, that the Bank is prepared to act to cool the market if necessary. Buyer demand for properties in the capital fell for a second month in June, Rics said, in its latest snapshot of the market. Last month, Carney announced the first limits on the mortgage market in 30 years. Under the measures, the Bank will not allow lenders to extend more than 15% of their mortgages to customers needing to borrow four-and-a-half times their income. Although he admitted the move would have no immediate impact, as no lender is currently at that ceiling, the Bank has calculated that it will start to have an impact if house prices rise more than 20% between now and the first quarter of 2017. Simon Rubinsohn, Rics chief economist, said changes introduced in the Bank's mortgage market review \u2013 which requires lenders to apply stricter rules when assessing whether a borrower will be able to meet mortgage payments \u2013 were also having an impact. He said: \"The Bank of England's recent introduction of a ceiling on high loan-to-income lending and a 3% interest rate stress test is unlikely on its own to have an immediate influence on the market. However, rhetoric from key officials at the Bank, including Mark Carney, alongside the consequences of the introduction of the mortgage market review, are already slowing momentum, particularly in London. \"Buyer inquiries in the capital are now slipping back, which suggests that the very sharp upward move in prices will flatten over the coming months. Elsewhere around the country we believe the more hard-fought recovery should remain intact.\" UK-wide, a balance of +53% of surveyors reported house price rises in June, slightly down on May's +56%. Rics said the strongest price gains were in the south east of England and Northern Ireland, but price growth eased in London. Looking ahead, fewer surveyors in June were predicting house price rises over the next three months compared with May. Meanwhile, Halifax reported a 0.6% drop in house prices in June, knocking the average price of a UK home down \u00a31,100 to \u00a3183,462. It followed a sharp 4% rise in May. The lender said that recent falls in buyer inquiries could also weigh on the market if they were sustained. Despite the fall in prices in June \u2013 the fourth drop since December \u2013 Halifax cautioned that monthly data could be volatile, and looking at longer-term movements in prices was a better indicator of trends. UK houses prices rose by 2.3% in the three months to June compared with the three months to March, consistent with a 2% or higher quarterly rate of growth over the past year. The annual rate of growth was 8.8% in June \u2013 the highest since October 2007 \u2013 the month after Northern Rock's financial woes triggered a run on the bank. Rob Wood, economist at the German bank Berenberg, said there were signs that the UK housing market is stabilising. \"The pace of increase is not slowing, but it has stabilised.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Average wages in Britain have fallen further than official figures show after a huge shift into low-paid self-employment since the financial crash, according to a report by a leading thinktank. The fall in wages could be 20% greater than currently estimated across the whole workforce once Britain's 4.5 million self-employed people are included in pay figures, said the Resolution Foundation. A real-terms fall of 10% in average wages since 2008 would increase to more than 12% if a 27% fall in self-employed incomes is taken into account. Before the Bank of England's decision on interest rates at its monthly meeting, the thinktank said the exclusion of pay figures for the self-employed gave a skewed picture of the health of the UK's labour market. Officials on the Bank's monetary policy committee, which sets interest rates, are understood to be concerned that the exclusion of self-employed incomes from official figures hampers their efforts to gauge when to increase the cost of credit. Laura Gardiner, a senior analyst at the Resolution Foundation and the author of the paper, said official figures used by the Bank and other policymakers gave \"a picture that's incomplete at best and sometimes misleading\". She said: \"What we know about earnings is central to our understanding of the recovery and the timing of interest rate rises so it's crucial that we equip ourselves with the best possible wage measure.\" More than 700,000 people have declared themselves self-employed since 2008, bringing the total number of people who work for themselves to 4.5 million or one in seven of the total. Over the same period only 260,000 workers have been added to the ranks of the employed on a net basis, said the report. The thinktank believes wage levels were underestimated in the immediate aftermath of the financial crash as self-employed people maintained healthier incomes than employees on average. But once the recession was under way and newly unemployed workers switched to self-employment, usually to take on part-time roles, average wages fell. Changes in the self-employed workforce \u2013 with more women and more workers from lower-paid sectors \u2013 are also likely to have had an effect. \"It's also the case that the self-employed have greater flexibility to respond to lower demand by making ever deeper cuts to their earnings,\" she said. Resolution said the effect was similar whether the median or mean calculation of wages was used. Resolution Foundation boss Gavin Kelly said the Office for National Statistics had a \"lopsided approach\" to measuring the health of the labour market. While self-employment is counted when calculating the number of new jobs in the economy, the incomes of self-employed people are excluded, he said. The situation is of growing concern to policymakers who want to understand the strength of the recovery and its effect on living standards. The Bank's monetary policy committee is expected to raise interest rates before the end of 2014 despite concerns among business groups and anti-poverty campaigners that wages remain well below their peak and pay awards remain weak. \u2022 The headline and copy of this article were corrected on Wednesday 9 July 2014 as they stated that the Resolution Foundation claimed wages could be 20% lower than currently estimated",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "If Justin King doesn't manage to find himself a new job soon after leaving Sainsbury's, he could set up as an evangelist preacher or guru. Somehow the worries over two quarters of falling underlying sales and the supermarket's risky move into discount retailing through a joint venture with the Danish chain Netto seemed forgotten yesterday when its annual shareholder meeting turned into a love-in for the departing chief executive. After tributes from the chairman and incoming boss Mike Coupe, and round after round of applause, King was mobbed by staff and shareholders seeking his autograph on their annual report, a selfie in front of the supermarket's logo or just to shake his hand. Even former Sainsbury's chairman Lord (John) Sainsbury turned up to congratulate King on his last day in the office. There were laughs in the audience when one shareholder named Philip Clarke stepped up to ask a question, deliciously suggesting the idea that the under-pressure Tesco chief executive of the same name had turned up to ask King's advice. But this Clarke seemed mostly interested in the amount of duck Sainsbury was forced to dispose of every year - sadly not even King could answer for that one. The next shareholder, however had a much more serious question: given the good job he'd done at Sainsbury's could King make a move to Marks &amp; Spencer where boss Marc Bolland is under fire amid falling profits and disappointing sales? The answer from King was a definite negative \u2013 he would not be joining a company that competes with Sainsbury's. After 10 years at the top and with just minutes to go until his retirement, King seemed unwilling to relinquish control of Sainsbury's at all, taking charge of a presentation of the annual results to shareholders and fielding questions on the display of semi-naked women in tabloid papers, on goods sourced from Israel and the location of new stores. He seemed to have a grasp of the detail on all these topics, perhaps no surprise given that he claims to read every email and letter sent to him by staff and shoppers. Some shareholders speaking afterwards were worried Sainsbury's could face the same fate as Tesco, where the ship ran into trouble almost the moment long-term boss Sir Terry Leahy had disembarked. \"Justin King is the main reason behind Sainsbury's success over the past few years; him leaving is certainly disappointing,\" said one. But King insisted his legacy was secure. \"I've been honoured to lead this business for 10 years and I know it is in safe hands,\" he said. Speaking after the event King, who has previously left Coupe to lead explanations of the Netto deal, confirmed he had been involved in the development of the plan. \"I was fully part of it and I fully support it,\" he said. Coupe himself insisted it would be business as usual after King's departure with no change to its focus on \"values\" such as Fairtrade bananas alongside competitive prices and good customer service. He admitted that the business would have to adjust to a changing world where discounters such as Aldi and Lidl had more power and shoppers wanted more small local stores but he said his role would be like that of a DJ keeping the music playing at optimum levels. \"Imagine it like a 1980s graphic equaliser. We will just have to move the knobs a little.\" He said that the Netto deal was \"low risk\" with a \"relatively small amount of capital investment relative to the size of the business and to the risk our competitors have taken it is proportionately tiny\". The scale of the task facing Sainsbury's new chief executive to win over shareholders started his life as Sainsbury's chief executive in a typically low key way \u2013 after a goodbye lunch with King and a string of friendly former Sainsbury's directors, he was handing out awards to sixth form students at his old school. But the scale of his task to win over shareholders was laid bare when one at the meeting asked him to autograph her annual report. \"I really came here just for Justin but it would be great if you'd sign it too,\" she admitted.",

The answer from King was a definite negative \u2013 he would not be joining a company that competes with Sainsbury's.</p> <p>After 10 years at the top and with just minutes to go until his retirement, King seemed unwilling to relinquish control of Sainsbury's at all, taking charge of a presentation of the annual results to shareholders and fielding questions on the display of semi-naked women in tabloid papers, on goods sourced from Israel and the location of new stores. He seemed to have a grasp of the detail on all these topics, perhaps no surprise given that he claims to read every email and letter sent to him by staff and shoppers.</p> <p>Some shareholders speaking afterwards were worried Sainsbury's could face the same fate as Tesco, where the ship ran into trouble almost the moment long-term boss Sir Terry Leahy had disembarked. \"Justin King is the main reason behind Sainsbury's success over the past few years; him leaving is certainly disappointing,\" said one.</p> <p>But King insisted his legacy was secure. \"I've been honoured to lead this business for 10 years and I know it is in safe hands,\" he said.</p> <p>Speaking after the event King, who has previously left Coupe to lead explanations of the Netto deal, confirmed he had been involved in the development of the plan. \"I was fully part of it and I fully support it,\" he said.</p> <p>Coupe himself insisted it would be business as usual after King's departure with no change to its focus on \"values\" such as Fairtrade bananas alongside competitive prices and good customer service. He admitted that the business would have to adjust to a changing world where discounters such as Aldi and Lidl had more power and shoppers wanted more small local stores but he said his role would be like that of a DJ keeping the music playing at optimum levels. \"Imagine it like a 1980s graphic equaliser. We will just have to move the knobs a little.\" He said that the Netto deal was \"low risk\" with a \"relatively small amount of capital investment relative to the size of the business and to the risk our competitors have taken it is proportionately tiny\".</p> <p>The scale of the task facing Sainsbury's new chief executive to win over shareholders started his life as Sainsbury's chief executive in a typically low key way \u2013 after a goodbye lunch with King and a string of friendly former Sainsbury's directors, he was handing out awards to sixth form students at his old school.</p> <p>But the scale of his task to win over shareholders was laid bare when one at the meeting asked him to autograph her annual report.</p> <p>\"I really came here just for Justin but it would be great if you'd sign it too,\" she admitted.</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Justin King finally bowed out of Sainsbury's after leading the supermarket group through a turbulent 10 years that has seen a transformation in the landscape of the grocery sector. He handed over to Mike Coupe, his commercial director and right-hand man, at the group's annual meeting in London. King left on a relative high, having revived Sainsbury's to notch up nine years of uninterrupted sales growth until the last few months of his reign. Over the past decade, the supermarket industry has been buffeted by recession, intense competition, rapid developments in technology and changes to consumer spending habits. King's tenure was during a period of radical change that, according to experts, will continue until the end of the decade at least. In 2004, King had to deal with an internal crisis. In 2014, his successor must navigate an entire sector in flux. 2004 When King took over in March 2004, the grocery sector looked stable. Although Morrisons was stirring things up with its recently completed acquisition of Safeway, the Tesco juggernaut swept all before it. Sainsbury's self-inflicted woes, including billions of pounds wasted on a botched supply chain upgrade and a disastrous ad campaign featuring John Cleese shouting about low prices, were made worse by competition from Asda and Tesco. But there was little sign of a challenge to the new big four. Edward Garner, director at Kantar Worldpanel, says: \"The market was more conventional. The discounters weren't registering the way they are now, Sainsbury's was in a mess and Tesco was rampant.\" The UK was in the middle of a consumer boom and moves into general merchandise such as white goods and TVs promised yet another source of revenues for the big chains. The supermarkets built more out-of-town outlets, leading to accusations they were killing high streets and carpeting green space with superstores. Tesco bore the brunt of protests as campaigners drew attention to the quality and provenance of supermarket food. Though the arrival of the German value chains Aldi and Lidl helped to see off the downmarket Kwik Save in 2007, they seemed to pose no threat to the mainstream. Ocado, the online grocer, had launched in 2002 in partnership with Waitrose but internet sales were an exotic niche in a market dominated by the weekly drive to a giant big four store. 2014 King leaves behind a market undergoing what some say is the biggest transformation since Sainsbury's opened the first UK self-service grocery store in 1950. The business models of the big four are under attack from new competition, fast-changing technology and a seemingly irreversible shift in shopping habits. The five years of recession followed by stagnation from 2008 cut consumer confidence and spending while high fuel costs made driving to a giant superstore expensive. People short of cash started shopping around and finding the value they wanted at Aldi and Lidl, sending their sales soaring. Local convenience stores took off as people tried to minimise food waste, while Waitrose thrived as those with cash to spend moved upmarket. Despite a pick-up in the wider economy, the grocery sector is barely growing, putting pressure on all the established supermarket groups. Clive Black, head of research at Shore Capital Stockbrokers, says: \"The British grocery market is facing big challenges. Demand is very weak and the price environment is quite intense.\" Tesco, seemingly unstoppable a decade ago, is a wounded giant bruised by profit warnings and falling sales while Morrisons' relative lack of convenience and online shopping has left it most exposed to the discounters. King navigated this turbulence by striking a successful balance between price and quality and getting into online and convenience shopping early. Sainsbury's had 44 convenience outlets in 2004 and now has 615. He has dismissed talk of a price war in the sector as a skirmish but in the last few weeks of his reign, Sainsbury's took a half share in the UK relaunch of Denmark's Netto to challenge the Germans without taking its brand downmarket. 2020 Retail experts do not expect any let-up in the sector's transformation over the next decade. Sales at the discounters and online will more than double in that time, according to IGD, the retail research firm. Even King, who likes to play down the significance of the rise of the discounters, has said the value-conscious shopper is here to stay and said Sainsbury's needs to highlight its low prices. As customers buy more online and a generation weaned on tablets and social media starts purchasing groceries, Britain's thousands of superstores could look more like what retail analyst Nick Bubb calls \"the white elephants of retailing\". Click and collect, now in its infancy, will become mainstream as retailers dance to the tune of shoppers wanting maximum convenience. Garner at Kantar expects the French \"Drive\" concept to take off \u2013 letting shoppers order on their phone and pick up goods without leaving their car at a drive-through warehouse. The rise of the discounter grocers will also include Poundland, B&amp;M and other cheap chains expanding into food, Nick Gladding at IGD says. Bubb says discount fever could even bring an end to the big four. \"It's possible that Morrisons might be broken up,\" he says. \"They are very, very late to the game in online and convenience and their northern heartland is being invaded, so I wouldn't rule that out.\"",

      "bodyText": "Britain's financial watchdog will investigate allegations that high frequency traders unfairly steal a march on rival investors as part of a broad \"exploratory\" review of competition in wholesale financial markets. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said it was concerned that the tactics used by some traders to beat rivals in the race for stock market information prevented new entrants from operating on a level playing field. The review will also look more broadly at competition in wholesale banking \u2013 services provided away from the high street between banks and other types of financial institutions. Mary Starks, director of competition at the FCA, said the watchdog had launched an exploratory exercise to determine where competition may be weak. \"And why is it important? Because wholesale financial markets play a crucial role in the economy, and the UK plays a key role in the international markets,\" she said. The review comes more than five years after the Lehman Brothers crash exposed a web of complex relationships between banks and other financial institutions. Regulators at the time were fiercely criticised for failing to spot that much of the deal-making was for no purpose other than to ramp up profits, with retail investors and pension savers the ultimate losers. High frequency trading has come under the spotlight in the US, largely in response to Michael Lewis's book Flash Boys, which documents how some firms have either located their servers in so-called co-hosting arrangements or laid dedicated fibre optic cables to exchanges to obtain a split-second lead on rivals. Co-hosting is the name given to the practice of positioning servers inside existing exchanges to confirm trades and source sensitive information ahead of rival firms. The FCA said it wanted to assess concerns that this practice could exclude new entrants and harm competition. Starks said that the FCA's remit to promote effective competition meant being proactive in rooting out competition issues rather than waiting for problems to occur. Another area the FCA will look at is cross-selling and bundling of products and services, she said. \"The review describes various areas where this market feature might exist; from investment banking, to asset management, to trading venues and clearing houses that are vertically integrated,\" Starks said. Some big investors have complained about not having a choice of clearing house for their derivatives transactions when they trade on a particular exchange, especially as new rules mean more trades must be cleared. In place for only a year, the FCA was set up as part of George Osborne's post-financial-crisis shakeup of supervision to protect consumers better and increase competition in markets. The latest inquiry follows the announcement by the chancellor of a \"fair and effective financial markets review\" last month, which will be carried out by the FCA, Treasury and Bank of England over the next 12 months. The study will cover markets, their infrastructure, asset management and corporate and investment banking, but not credit rating agencies, payment systems or insurance, Starks said. The review will also look at potential conflicts of interest in providing investors with the best share price in the market, and the underwriting of equity and debt. The FCA is first asking for comment on potential competition issues from industry and the public until 9 October with a view to starting a detailed market study in early 2015.",

On Tuesday, the Greek parliament formally legalized efforts to further liberalise the market by allowing shops to open on Sunday. The decision \u2013 published in the parliament\u2019s gazette \u2013 now paves the way for stores to open across a wide swath of Athens and on islands and other tourist centres nationwide. The ban \u2013 for many the clearest sign of one of Europe\u2019s most closed economies - had been strongly supported by the Greek Orthodox Church and the communist KKE party which had argued that de-regulation of trading hours would do little more than benefit major interest groups \u201cwho want to increase their profits and exploitation of workers.\u201d</p> <p>But while that appears to be a battle lost, the public sector cleaners fighting mass-firings at the finance ministry, appear to have won an unlikely ally. The nearly 400 female cleaners, who have become the face of the inequity of austerity, held talks with the country\u2019s spiritual leader, Archibishop Ieronymos of Athens, on Tuesday in which he promised to do whatever he could to help them. The cleaners, now in their eighth week of protest outside the ministry of finance in the heart of Athens, described the meeting as \u201ca huge morale booster\u201d in their often fractious dealings with the government.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2014-07-09T11:30:23.061Z\">at 12.30pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-53bd02b7e4b03dba04dbe18e\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-07-09T08:53:08.058Z\">9.53am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Read the story here....</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here's my colleague Lisa Bachelor's story on the latest house price figures:</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/jul/09/june-house-prices-fall\">Monthly house prices for June drop 0.6%, Halifax reports</a></h2> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-53bcfc5ee4b012f5b90a04c9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-07-09T08:29:37.732Z\">9.29am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><b>Ed Goodworth, </b>real estate partner at business advisory firm<b> BDO, </b>flags up anecdotal reports that fewer potential buyers are visiting new houses.<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cWe have been hearing about a slowing in footfall for new builds over the last six weeks.

      "bodyText": "And finally Helena Smith, our correspondent in Greece, reports that the surprise appearance of a crocodile on the island of Crete is providing some light relief for the austerity-hit nation: On a day where Greece\u2019s newly-installed finance minister Gikas Hardouvelis has promised that the country\u2019s onerous EU-IMF-sponsored bailout programme is coming to an end, the appearance of a crocodile on the island of Crete is also producing some light relief for austerity-hit Greeks. The two-meter-long reptile, more usually to be found in tropical climes \u2013 was spotted swimming in an artificial lake south of the seaside resort of Rethymno last week. Today local media reported that a second crocodile had also been spotted in the same man-made reservoir intensifying efforts by regional authorities to remove the reptiles from the area. \u201cCrocodiles cannot survive and reproduce on Crete,\u201d said Rethymno\u2019s mayor Giorgos Marinakis, announcing that an operation would get underway to capture the creature and return it to its natural environment. The crocodile has become a local sensation with fans christening it \"Sifis\" and setting up a Facebook page in its honour. That is all for today. Thank you for joining us, we'll be back tomorrow. AM The FTSE 100 has slipped to a two-month low. Other major European markets are up. FTSE 100: -0.37% at 6,713.74 DAX: +0.15% at 9,797 CAC 40: +0.16% at 4,349.42 FTSE MIB: +1.01% at 20,909.45 IBEX 35: +0.5 at 10,742.70 We're back to the issue of \"group think\". Andrew Tyrie is in classic job interviewer mode. He wants examples of how she has demonstrated \"independence of mind\" in the past. She cites the \"difficult messages\" she had to get across on the eurozone while at the IMF. Shafik says that as permanent secretary she was accustomed to telling minister things they did not wish to hear. And with that, Tyrie brings the session to a close. Shafik says there are problems across FX, fixed income, and commodities benchmarking. She says that the UK needs flexibility when it comes to EU financial regulation, rather than a separate rule book. The TSC's Jesse Norman wants to know whether Shafik penned her written submission to the committee or whether it was Mark Carney or Sir Jon Cunliffe were behind. She says she called upon Bank data and staff were very helpful but she takes full responsibility for the document. On the BoE's bank sheet in the future, Shafik says it will most likely be smaller than the \u00a3400bn it is now, but bigger than the \u00a350bn before the pre-crisis. Now we turn to the housing market. \"The vulnerability around household debt is a very serious one,\" Shafik says. She adds that although the measures announced by the Financial Policy Committee last month will not have an immediate impact on the housing market, they should stop a \"worrying bubble\" from emerging. Shafik says the FPC has a big explaining job to do, because it is easier to communicate inflation targeting (for the MPC) than it is to explain the issues around financial stability. Unemployment is the next topic. What is the equilibrium rate, she is asked by Conservative MP David Ruffley. Shafik thinks it's around 6%. The labour market was pretty flexible during the crisis. Most people were pleasantly surprised. The levels of youth unemployment in the UK are not bad relative to other countries. The biggest contribution the Bank of England can make is to the overall economy. She is asked what level private sectgor wage growth would have to reach before she was concerned about inflation. She says she wouldn't look at wage growth in isolation. If [wage growth] was accompanied by growth in productivity it would be sustainable. If not accompanied by growth in productivity it would be a worry. \"We are entering a period in all advanced economies where the natural rate of interest is lower than it was before,\" Shafik says. i.e. the new norm for UK interest rates will be below the 5% pre-crisis level. Labour MP Pat McFadden turns his attention to the eurozone crisis. What's Shafik's view on the region's progress on closer integration? She says there has been \"quite good progress\" on the European Stability Mechanism. But bank resolution plans are too reliant on national mechanisms. \"I'm not being hired to exclusive look at monetary policy\", Shafik tells Tyrie. She'll be working more broadly across all the Bank's areas of policy and responsibility. Now we're on to spare capacity in the UK economy, which the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee has estimated to be running at around 1-1.5%. Shafik says that the next estimate (at the Bank's August inflation report), will probably show that slack in the economy has fallen (which means we'll be closer to a rate rise). The session is about to begin. The committee's chairman Andrew Tyrie welcomes Nemat 'Minouche' Shafik and asks her to outline here experience. She talks about her role at the IMF, and her experience of working with some of the troubled eurozone economies. Before MPs on the Treasury Select Committee begin their questioning of Nemat Shafik (often known by her nickname Minouche) at 2.15pm, here is a quick reminder of her background. Shafik joins the Bank of England from the International Monetary Fund, where she was deputy managing director responsible for the IMF's work in Europe and the Middle East, its $1bn administrative budget and human resources policies for the Fund's 3,000 staff (among other things). Born in Egypt, she is also a British and US national, holds a degree in economics and politics from the University of Massachusetts-Amherst, an MSc in Economics from the London School of Economics, and a DPhil in Economics from St. Antony\u2019s College, Oxford University. Having been the youngest ever vice president at the World Bank at just 36, she then joined the UK\u2019s Department for International Development (DFID) and rose to become the department\u2019s most senior civil servant ( permanent secretary) At DFID she oversaw all Britain\u2019s overseas development work, including bilateral aid programmes in over 100 countries, before joining the IMF in 2011. Next up: Dr Nemat Shafik, who joins the Bank of England as deputy governor in August, is being questioned by the Treasury committee. The session starts at 2.15pm - it's being streamed live here (right-click to open in a new tab). My colleague Angela Monaghan is going to cover it. Cheers all. GW Another Greek development - it is expected to announce a new bond sale today, the second one since its bailout. More here. Time to recap: Economists have predicted that UK house prices will keep climbing this year and in 2015, despite the latest survey showing prices fell back last month Halifax's monthly survey of the sector found that the average price of a house fell 0.6% in June. But it's still up 2.3% in the last quarter. The survey has led to new calls for Britain to build more houses, to tackle the property shortage that is helping to push prices up. As Peter Williams, executive director of the Intermediary Mortgage Lenders Association (IMLA), put it: The need for a joined-up housing policy is growing as fast as house prices themselves. The Bank of England has not ruled out a further rationing of mortgages, but the danger is that creditworthy consumers will suffer while cash buyers escape and house prices fail to respond. The only long term solution is to address the persistent shortage of housing supply. The need for coordinated political action is beyond doubt.\u201d In other news: Greek public sector workers have marched through Athens to protest against job cuts, reductions in wages and pensions, and asset sales. They are striking as troika officials return to Greece, as politicians and religious leaders criticise the decision to allow shops to open on Sunday. Sainsbury CEO Justin King has received a warm reception at his final AGM.... ....but shareholders also voiced criticism over gender balance, and tabloid newspapers. Bentley has revealed it has posted record sales in the first six months of 2014, with strong demand in China and the Middle East. Pub chain JD Wetherspoon has criticised the government's new late night levy, saying it will close pubs early rather than fork out thousands of pounds to cover policing costs. Over in Greece, civil servants have marched through Athens to protest against the country's austerity programme. As we covered at 10.15am, workers are protesting against the government's job cuts, wage and pension reductions, and its privatisation programme. Here's the latest photos from the scene: Here's Associated Press's take: Greece's public sector workers are holding a 24-hour strike, shutting down public services and leaving state-run hospitals accepting only emergency cases to protest austerity policies imposed in return for the country's bailout. Wednesday's strike did not affect public transport, although some roads in central Athens were briefly shut down for a demonstration. Another rally was scheduled for the evening. The strike comes as Greece's debt inspectors from the International Monetary Fund, European Central Bank and European Commission return to Athens to review the country's progress in economic reforms. And there's a bit of a row over Sainsbury's expansion plans in a leafy part of London Another Sainsbury investor reckons the company is throwing money away on its non-executive directors: A Marks &amp; Spencer shareholder hopes that Justin King might use his talents to revive M&amp;S's fortunes -- no chance! Another Sainsbury shareholder is criticising the company for not promoting more women to run its stores. New CEO Mike Coupe says he's going to make this a big issue King replies that he will keep the issue of tabloid newspapers \"under constant review\". (at least until the end the day, after which it's not his problem any more) The clapping is over (fear it may return, though), and Sainsbury shareholders are now having their say at the AGM. One investor demands to know why the company tolerates certain tabloid newspapers: Following Justin King at Sainsbury's must be a little daunting. Paddy Power is offering odds of 9-1 that Mike Coupe matches King's record of 36 quarters of consecutive growth. They're up to five rounds of applause at the Sainsbury's AGM -- now the new CEO, Mike Coupe, is chipping in. There's more... Chairman David Tyler is also doing his bit: There's a real Justin King love-in underway at the Sainsbury's AGM. Lord Sainsbury has popped up to lead the tributes, congratulating King on his \"hard work and inspiration\" in making the supermarket \"great again\". Back in London, J Sainsbury is about to kick off its annual general meeting with shareholders. It's CEO Justin King's final duty before stepping down after a decade running the supermarket, so the praise could be laid on with a jumbo-sized trowel. Justin King's 10-year reign at Sainsbury's draws to a close at AGM But there are also protesters outside the AGM: Luxury carmaker Bentley has announced that it's on track for a record year, with demand from China, the Middle East and Germany all surging. The Crewe-based firm has posted a 23% jump in sales so far this year, delivering 5,254 vehicles since the start of January. Sales leapt by 61% in China, driven by demand for its \"Flying Spur and Flying Spur V8\" models. Japanese sales surged 56%, while Bentley sold 27% more cars in the Middle East. Despite the weakness of the Eurozone recovery, sales in Europe are up 11% this year, thanks to a \"strong performance in Germany\". But the UK market was more subdued, with sales up 2% - from 698 cars in the first half of 2013 to 713 this year. Sales in the Americas rose 8% to 1,388; it's still the largest market for Bentley. Bentley board member Kevin Rose declared: \"There is no question that some markets will remain tough but we are confident of a good 2014.\u201d Bentley's new Flying Spur costs \u00a3140,900 (before 'add-ons'), so today's sales figues are the latest confirmation that the spending power of the world's richest people is undimmed. Yesterday, Rolls-Royce reported that it had achieved record results so far this year. Like Bentley, it also cited strong demand in the Asia Pacific region, the Middle East, and Germany. Speaking of Greece, new data shows that prices continued to fall in June, but at a slower rate. Consumer prices fell by 1.5% in June, on an EU-harmonised basis, compared with June 2013. They'd shrunk by 2% annually in May. The wider eurozone inflation rate has been stuck at 0.5% since May, as this chart shows: Elstat also reported that food and non-alcohol prices fell by 2.9% annually in June, clothing and footwear prices dropped 3%, and education costs fell 4%. But the cost of alcohol (+1.3%), transport (+0.6%) and communication (+0.1) services all rose. It\u2019s a big day in Greece where the country\u2019s powerful union of civil servants has organized a national strike today \u2013 just as parliament gears up to vote on the part privatisation of the public power corporation (PCC). Doctors and prison staff are taking part. Our correspondent Helena Smith reports: Public sector employees denouncing the reforms demanded by the country\u2019s creditors are holding two protest rallies: the first at 11am (9am GST) and the second at 2pm (noon) In a statement released by the civil servants\u2019 union ADEDY, the striking workers said they had been forced to take to the streets to protest the government\u2019s privatization programme, evaluation scheme and mass firing of fellow employees. \u201cAt a time when the government is intensifying its attacks against workers, the response that it gets must be universal,\u201d it declared \u201cWe will not allow the carnivalism that the government wants to promote in the public services. They wll not have us as an associate in this crime.\u201d The 24-hour walk-out comes three days after the conservative-dominated government mobilised striking workers at DEH, the state-run electricity company and hours before parliament prepares to vote on selling off 30% of the company. Helena explains: Last night 15 independent MPs signaled they would support the call of the vehemently anti-austerity main opposition Syriza party to hold a debate on plans to hold a referendum on the sale. Missions heads representing Greece\u2019s \u201ctroika\u201d of foreign lenders at the EU, ECB and IMF are also due to begin talks in Athens today at the start of a new review of the Greek economy. Passions are running high. On Tuesday, the Greek parliament formally legalized efforts to further liberalise the market by allowing shops to open on Sunday. The decision \u2013 published in the parliament\u2019s gazette \u2013 now paves the way for stores to open across a wide swath of Athens and on islands and other tourist centres nationwide. The ban \u2013 for many the clearest sign of one of Europe\u2019s most closed economies - had been strongly supported by the Greek Orthodox Church and the communist KKE party which had argued that de-regulation of trading hours would do little more than benefit major interest groups \u201cwho want to increase their profits and exploitation of workers.\u201d But while that appears to be a battle lost, the public sector cleaners fighting mass-firings at the finance ministry, appear to have won an unlikely ally. The nearly 400 female cleaners, who have become the face of the inequity of austerity, held talks with the country\u2019s spiritual leader, Archibishop Ieronymos of Athens, on Tuesday in which he promised to do whatever he could to help them. The cleaners, now in their eighth week of protest outside the ministry of finance in the heart of Athens, described the meeting as \u201ca huge morale booster\u201d in their often fractious dealings with the government. Here's my colleague Lisa Bachelor's story on the latest house price figures: Monthly house prices for June drop 0.6%, Halifax reports Ed Goodworth, real estate partner at business advisory firm BDO, flags up anecdotal reports that fewer potential buyers are visiting new houses. \u201cWe have been hearing about a slowing in footfall for new builds over the last six weeks. The change in mortgage rules and uncertainty regarding interest rates are likely to have had an impact. But there's still that supply problem, keeping prices up: The uncertainty generated by the changes in interest rates, mortgage rules and an impending election are all acting as brakes on house prices, but we are short of a correction in the housing market particularly in London and the South East.\u201d Andy Hatoum, co-founder of the property search engine Placebuzz.com, also reckons the quarterly house price data (showing a 2.3% rise) is a better guide: \u201cAfter runaway month-on-month growth of 4% in May, June\u2019s slight drop would seem like a sudden reversal. \u201cBut in reality it\u2019s a case of the market pausing for breath. As prices begin to top out in some areas, such volatility is inevitable. \u201cMake no mistake though, the overall direction of travel remains skyward. There is still plenty of momentum in much of the country \u2013 especially in those areas where the boom took longer to get going.\" Hatoum also reckons that the Bank of England's 'modest' measures* to tighten mortgage lending won't dampen the market. * - it wants lenders to restrict the number of very high income-to-value mortgages, and test whether borrowers could cope with a 3% rise in interest rates Some more context: IHS Global Insight is slightly more cautious than Berenberg, predicting UK house prices will rise by a further 4% this year, and by 6%-7% in 2015. Their chief economist, Howard Archer, writes: It is apparent that housing market activity has slowed recently. Specifically, the Bank of England reported that mortgage approvals for house purchases moderated for a fourth month running in May to be at an 11-month low of 61,707. Clearly the introduction of new regulations under the Mortgage Market Review (MMR) has - at least temporarily - taken some of the steam out of housing market activity. Let's get some perspective on the data from Rob Wood, economist at Berenberg. He's compared today's Halifax's survey with the latest data from Nationwide, and concluded that house price inflation has stabilised - at around 10% per year. Wood explains: The pace of increase is not slowing, but it has stabilised. Tighter regulations and the real chance of an interest rate hike this year have stabilised leading indicators and actual price inflation at current strong rates. We look for house prices to gain 10% in 2014 and 10% in 2015. Wood also reckons that the UK recovery, and its chronic supply problems, will prevent prices coming off the boil: Leading indicators remain strong, while the BoE\u2019s intention to hike interest rates gradually means borrowing costs will remain supportive for several years. Consumer\u2019s job worries are the lowest in 16 years, while insufficient housebuilding perpetuates a supply shortage. Tighter regulations introduced in April through the Mortgage Market Review are mainly an administrative problem for banks. It now takes much longer to process applications, which has slowed housing transactions without hurting prices much. We expect mortgage approvals to return to their upward trend over the next few months. Halifax also reckons that the price/earnings ratio slipped slightly to 4.95 in June, from 4.98 in May. That's based on the average earnings for full-time male employees, though. The average full-time UK salary is actually \u00a327,000 -- meaning the average house (\u00a3183,462) is 6.8 times higher. Halifax argues that its quarterly house price data gives a better picture of the housing market. That showed a 2.3% rise in the April-June period, compared to January-March. Stephen Noakes, its mortgages director, reckons: \"Housing demand continues to be supported by an economic recovery that is gathering pace, with employment levels growing and rising consumer confidence, although real earnings growth remains sluggish.\" But Halifax also flags up two reasons for caution: Home sales edged down by 3% in May to below 100,000 for the first time in six months; however, transactions are still 15% higher than in May 2013. (Source: HMRC, seasonally- adjusted figures) New buyer enquires fell for the sixth consecutive month in May, which if sustained could moderate further growth in demand. (Source: RICS) This is the fourth time this year that Halifax has reported a drop in house prices. Their monthly index does appear to be quite volatile, though, -- it showed a 3.8% jump last month. Despite June's dip, prices are still up by 2.3% over the last quarter, compared to the previous three months. UK house prices fell by 0.6% in June, according to Halifax's monthly survey of the sector. That's a bigger drop than expected, and suggests the property sector may be cooling as new mortgage affordability rules are applied. The index also shows that prices have risen by 8.8% across the country in the last year, pushing up the average house price to \u00a3183,462. Details and reaction to follow... Britain's pubs will be kicking out a little earlier. JD Wetherspoon told shareholders this morning that the new Late-Night Levy - designed to make landlords share the cost of policing the streets - is eating into profits. The impact of the coalition government's 'late night levy' is starting to take effect, with annual charges of up to about \u00a34,000 per annum for pubs opening beyond midnight in Newcastle and Islington, for example. Wetherspoon has decided to reduce opening hours from the current 1am to midnight on Fridays and Saturdays, at most of our affected pubs, as and when the levy is introduced or renewed - a retrograde step for pubs, which will have a positive impact on supermarkets, since they will benefit from earlier pub closures. It also reported that sales have dipped a little during the World Cup. This is a little awkward. Pharmaceutical firm AbbVie has been forced to backtrack on its claim that many Shire shareholders support its \u00a330bn takeover bid, after violating the City's rules. Yesterday, AbbVie CEO Richard Gonzalez told reporters that Shire investors were \"generally supportive of the transaction\" -- something you're just not supposed to say unless you've got it in writing. And thus, Abbvie has now retracted: AbbVie confirms that it has not received any written commitments of support and accordingly retracts the statements. It acknowledges that in the absence of written statements of support from shareholders it is not in a position to make any statement of shareholder support which accords with the provisions of Rule 19.3. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial market, the economy, the eurozone and business. Has Britain's properly market started to cool? We find out shortly, when Halifax releases its latest monthly house price index. Economists have predicted it could show a small drop in prices, down perhaps 0.3% month-on-month. Tighter mortgage affordability rules and the prospect of interest rate rises may have hit demand. But it's a volatile index, so it could well show that momentum is still strong in the market. Over in Greece, meanwhile, the civil service union ADEDY has called a strike today in protest at the government's programme of public sector job cuts. That'll show how much anger is still simmering in Greece about its austerity programme, as its Trioka of lenders return to Athens for another review of its bailout programme. And in London, supermarket chain Sainsbury is holding its AGM -- it's the last one before long-service chief executive Justin King departs. Otherwise, I fear we're drifting into the summer slowdown. Here's the opening calls: FTSE 100 is expected to open 3 points lower at 6,735 German DAX is expected to open 20 points higher at 9,793 French CAC is expected to open 8 points higher at 4,350",

      "bodyText": "Britain's economic recovery accelerated in the second quarter despite a surprise fall in manufacturing output in May, according to a respected thinktank. The National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) said the unexpected drop in production would weigh \"only marginally\" on the wider economy, estimating a 0.9% rise in GDP between April and June, an improvement on the first quarter's 0.8% growth. Simon Kirby of NIESR said: \"We have to remember the manufacturing sector accounts for only 10% of the overall economy. In addition we expect the manufacturing sector to rebound in June, offsetting much of the drop in output in May.\" The first official estimate of the second quarter will be published by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) on 25 July. Economists were left baffled by the apparent slowdown in Britain's factories in May, when manufacturing output fell by 1.3%, defying City expectations of a 0.4% rise. It was the biggest drop in 16 months and marked the end of a five-month run of expansion \u2013 the longest since 2010. The ONS said the decline was broad-based. Metals, pharmaceuticals, and electronics saw the biggest falls, which offset a rise in clothing manufacturing. Economists suggested a \"Goldilocks\" period \u2013 where the UK economy is neither too hot nor too cold \u2013 could be coming to an end. Martin Beck of the EY Item Club said: \"Weaker demand from overseas, as well as the headwinds presented by the strength of sterling \u2026 are likely to have contributed to the poor performance of the sector.\"",
