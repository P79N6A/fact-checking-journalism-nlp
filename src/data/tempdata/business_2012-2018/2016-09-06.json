The \u00a3150m extension to John Lewis\u2019s Milton Keynes depot features pastel cardigans, party dresses and fluorescent T-shirts flying past on hi-tech ceiling rails. Sports Direct\u2019s founder and majority shareholder, Mike Ashley, will be taking note. Ashley once said he wanted to become an employer on a par with John Lewis, the department store co-owned by its workers who take a share of profits every year. But a tour of the brightly lit Magna Park 3 site, with its polished concrete floors, indicates he has some way to go. The building features a giant Meccano-style set of metal racking, up to 25 metres high in some places, across which garments and green plastic boxes of products are carried to staff at computerised work stations. Dino Rocos, operations director at John Lewis, says theretailer\u2019s warehouse is designed to take stock to packers \u2013 who process orders for stores and from online customers \u2013 as quickly as possible. It\u2019s a world away from Sports Direct\u2019s Shirebrook warehouse, where more than 4,000 zero-hours workers trundle racks of clothing up and down dark warehouse aisles, walking as much as 20 miles a day. At Shirebrook, the largely unautomated systems are years behind the times, with the most hi-tech gadget after a hand-held scanner likely to be a ballpoint pen. John Lewis employs 1,000 permanent staff at its three Magna Park sites, which cover 2.4m sq ft, storing 235,000 products. According to John Lewis, 650 of those staff are directly employed by the department store, earning between \u00a37.50 and \u00a39.30 an hour, as well as an annual bonus which last year amounted to 10% of their salary. At Sports Direct, the majority of staff aged over 25 began began earning \u00a37.35 an hour from April, 15p ahead of the newly introduced national living wage. When he announced the 15p-an-hour pay rise in December last year, Ashley said he wanted to make Sports Direct \u201cthe best high street retail employer after John Lewis\u201d. While Sports Direct\u2019s sales suffered last year, John Lewis has been able to use its superior technology to move ahead. During the peak sale period last year, on Black Friday (27 November) the business was able to process five parcels per second.",

      "bodyText": "The culture of fear in Sports Direct\u2019s warehouse has yet to be eradicated, workers claimed, as the company promised on Tuesday to improve conditions as part of a number of pledges published in an internal report. Sources close to the retailer\u2019s depot in Shirebrook, Derbyshire, said they continue to be afraid for their jobs and were too scared to raise grievances. One worker employed in Shirebrook through an employment agency \u2013 like the majority of staff at the warehouse \u2013 said that during the summer some employees had been switched to rotas in which they had to work extra shifts at short notice, creating problems with childcare. The source said: \u201cThey were changing rotas at very short notice. You must go [to work the shift] because people are scared. If you say you can\u2019t go to work the agency then calls you to say \u2018sorry, we don\u2019t need you\u2019.\u201d Two other sources indicated that workers remained worried that complaining about the treatment of workers inside the facility could cost them their jobs. The comments were made as Sports Direct published an internal investigation into working conditions that was conducted by the retailer\u2019s law firm, RPC. The report received a mix reception from trade unions and politicians who had been pressuring the group to improve its widely criticised working practices. There were concessions on zero-hours contracts for shop workers and a backtracking on the controversial six-strikes-and-you\u2019re-out policy in the warehouse. However, the report stopped short of pledging to employ about 4,000 warehouse workers directly via Sports Direct rather than on temporary agency contracts that currently apply to the vast majority of warehouse workers. One source close to the warehouse operation said the group did not have the internal human resources staff qualified to manage 4,000 full-time warehouse workers, even if it wanted to. In its report, Sports Direct pledged to bolster its human resources operation to ensure there was \u201cno culture of fear\u201d. The report was published in the wake of the Guardian\u2019s investigation into the retailer last year, when undercover reporters exposed how the group was paying many warehouse workers less than the national minimum wage. The Guardian investigation also spoke to local primary school teachers who said that parents who worked in the warehouse were sending their childrento school while ill because they were concerned they would lose their jobs if they took time off to care for a sick child. After sustained efforts to avoid giving evidence to a subsequent parliamentary inquiry into working conditions at the retailer, billionaire founder Mike Ashley finally appeared in June after being warned that he could have been found in contempt of parliament if he refused. At the hearing he confirmed the Guardian\u2019s reporting by admitting that the company had broken the law by paying some workers less than the legal minimum. HM Revenue &amp; Customs, along with the union Unite, which has led a long-running campaign highlighting conditions in Shirebrook, forced the company into making back payments of wages to short-changed minimum wage workers. The bill is thought likely to approach \u00a31m for the retailer and its employment agencies, who are also thought to be facing fines totalling about \u00a32m. RPC\u2019s report said that Sports Direct\u2019s failure to pay warehouse workers the legal minimum was \u201cunintentional\u201d.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Sports Direct is to put a workers\u2019 representative on its board and offer shop staff guaranteed hours instead of zero-hours contracts after admitting a string of failings in an internal report. The company apologised for conditions at its warehouse, including a \u201csix strikes\u201d policy that put workers in fear of losing their jobs, as founder Mike Ashley said he wanted to give workers a voice at the highest level and \u201cto help ensure that all staff are treated with dignity and respect\u201d. Ashley apologised to staff following the publication of the report and promised to turn the business into \u201cone of the best employers in Britain\u201d. In a letter to Sports Direct workers, he said: \u201cI have always believed that Sports Direct was built by the great people who work here. I therefore wish to apologise to you on behalf of myself and The Board for the shortcomings that have occurred in our working practices, which have been identified in the report.\u201d But Britain\u2019s biggest sportswear retailer has not extended its offer of guaranteed hours for shop employees to more than 4,000 agency workers at its depot in Shirebrook, Derbyshire, where working conditions have been compared to those of a Victorian workhouse. A review commissioned by Sports Direct said \u201cserious shortcomings [were] identified in working practices in [the] warehouse which the board deeply regrets and apologises for\u201d. The review was initiated after the Guardian exposed how temporary workers at its depots were effectively receiving hourly rates of pay below the minimum wage. The company has since increased pay and changed some working practices to ensure workers are paid at least the minimum. The Guardian\u2019s investigation detailed the \u201csix strikes\u201d policy that threatened Shirebrook workers with the sack if they accrued black marks for behaviour such as excessive chatting and long toilet breaks. The board has asked agencies to suspend the policy, which it said was \u201cpotentially oppressive\u201d and gave too much power to a few managers. The report, overseen by Sports Direct\u2019s lawyers Reynolds Porter Chamberlain (RPC), said Sports Direct commissioned the review partly in response to the Guardian\u2019s stories. Other pledges in the report included: Employing a full-time nurse and welfare officer at Shirebrook after unions found there were a large number of ambulance callouts to the site. Establishing a confidential system for reporting sexual harassment and training on the issue following claims that female staff were intimidated at Shirebrook. Fewer searches of warehouse staff and a reduction in the number of brands staff are banned from wearing in case of product theft, from more than 800 to 30. Deductions for clocking on one minute late have been changed from 15 minutes\u2019 worth of pay to five minutes, while if staff leave one minute early, either in stores or the warehouse, this will be ignored. In a video released on Tuesday night, Ashley said he wanted Sports Direct to be one of the first companies to put a workers\u2019 representative on its main board \u2013 an idea put forward by Theresa May to reform big business just prior to her becoming prime minister. Ashley described the proposal as a\u201dno-brainer\u201d, adding that he wanted workers to \u201chave a say and a vote\u201d. He added: \u201cI am totally in favour of that. I am totally in agreement with Theresa May.\u201d The billionaire suggested it would help ensure that the directors are kept in touch with the shopfloor: \u201cThat will be a great benefit to Sports Direct, because it is very difficult sometimes when you\u2019re not involved with everything going on and not in touch with everything. That input is invaluable.\u201d The Sports Direct internal report points the finger of blame at its own chief executive, Dave Forsey, saying he did not tell the board or Ashleyabout the potential for Sports Direct to pay below the minimum wage. Forsey, who is criticised for the way he managed the entire human resources department at Sports Direct, gave up a bonus worth almost \u00a34m in June because of the pay scandal which resulted in the company having to dole out about \u00a31m in back pay to warehouse staff. Sports Direct said directly employed warehouse staff - fewer than 400 people - had already received their back pay and it would also be writing to those eligible but no longer with the business this month. It said the employment agencies which handle the vast majority of workers at Shirebrook were only \u201cin discussion\u201d with workers about back pay but Sports Direct was \u201cstaying close to the situation\u201d. The report reveals that Sports Direct had no formal signed contract in place with either of the two employment agencies it works with, something Forsey is also held ultimately responsible for. \u201cThis is a serious failing given the importance of these agreements in relation to employment practices and their financial value,\u201d the report says. But Ashley, who was questioned by MPs over conditions at the warehouse, \u201ctakes ultimate responsibility for any aspects of the working practices that were unsatisfactory\u201d according to the report. Parliament\u2019s business, innovation and skills committee said working conditions at Shirebrook resembled a Victorian workhouse. Iain Wright, the chair of the committee, said the commitments made by the company showed it was going in the right direction but he noted that warehouse staff would stay on contracts that were effectively zero hours. Sports Direct said it was considering moving 10 agency staff a month to permanent jobs. Ashley, who also owns Newcastle United Football Club, has faced increasing pressure from shareholder groups in the run-up to Wednesday\u2019s annual general meeting with calls to overhaul the board of directors. A number of high-profile shareholders have also said they will support a union-backed resolution to launch an immediate independent review into working conditions at its warehouse and stores. The general secretary of trade union umbrella body the TUC, Frances O\u2019Grady, said on Tuesday that an independent review was still necessary. \u201cAn apology is always a good start, but this is too little, too late. What we really need is an independent investigation, as called for by the trade union resolution at tomorrow\u2019s Sports Direct AGM. \u201cA report written by a law firm which previously represented Mike Ashley and management simply won\u2019t cut it. Sports Direct cannot be allowed to mark their own homework.\u201d O\u2019Grady added: \u201cCases like this show why the government must act to end the abuse of zero-hours contracts, and get serious on enforcing employment rights.\u201d The RPC report revealed that Sports Direct\u2019s management had not responded to repeated requests for meetings by the Unite union, which has been formally recognised at its warehouse since 2008. It said a \u201csiege mentality had crept in\u201d as the company did not believe problems highlighted by the union actually existed. But it said it now planned to regularly engage with the union, including a meeting with its assistant general secretary next month, to \u201cembrace and resolve these issues\u201d. Unite assistant general secretary Steve Turner said: \u201cWe welcome the commitment by the Sports Direct board to work constructively with Unite to bring about real change in its efforts to address labour abuses and become an exemplary employer. \u201cOur members not only work for the retailer, but shop at Sports Direct too and will be heartened by the board\u2019s recognition of the severity of the issues Unite has raised and campaigned on.\u201d But he said Unite had concerns about the continued use of employment agencies Best Connection and Transline and asked the board to go further and faster in moving staff on to secure and direct contracts. Sports Direct said RPC\u2019s report was based on work done over the last three months and that it would carry out a further review of working practices and corporate governance ahead of next year\u2019s AGM. It promised to engage with shareholders to get their views as part of the report.Many independent shareholders are expected to vote against the reappointment of the chair, Keith Hellawell, and other non-executive directors at the meeting. Shares in the retailer rose nearly 6% to 351.9p on Tuesday as investors welcomed Sports Direct\u2019s actions and some key shareholders are now expected to support the board at the AGM.

The company has since increased pay and changed some working practices to ensure workers are paid at least the minimum.</p> <p>The Guardian\u2019s investigation detailed the \u201csix strikes\u201d policy that threatened Shirebrook workers with the sack if they accrued black marks for behaviour such as excessive chatting and long toilet breaks. </p> <p>The board has asked agencies to suspend the policy, which it said was \u201cpotentially oppressive\u201d and gave too much power to a few managers.</p> <p>The report, overseen by Sports Direct\u2019s lawyers Reynolds Porter Chamberlain (RPC), said Sports Direct commissioned the review partly in response to the Guardian\u2019s stories.</p> <p>Other pledges in the report included:</p> <ul> <li>Employing a full-time nurse and welfare officer at Shirebrook after unions found there were a large number of ambulance callouts to the site.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Establishing a confidential system for reporting sexual harassment and training on the issue following claims that female staff were intimidated at Shirebrook.<br><br></li> <li>Fewer searches of warehouse staff and a reduction in the number of brands staff are banned from wearing in case of product theft, from more than 800 to 30.<br><br></li> <li>Deductions for clocking on one minute late have been changed from 15 minutes\u2019 worth of pay to five minutes, while if staff leave one minute early, either in stores or the warehouse, this will be ignored.</li> </ul> <p>In a video released on Tuesday night, Ashley said he wanted Sports Direct to be one of the first companies to put a workers\u2019 representative on its main board \u2013 an idea put forward by Theresa May to reform big business just prior to her becoming prime minister. </p> <p>Ashley described the proposal as a\u201dno-brainer\u201d, adding that he wanted workers to \u201chave a say and a vote\u201d. He added: \u201cI am totally in favour of that. I am totally in agreement with Theresa May.\u201d<br></p> <p>The billionaire suggested it would help ensure that the directors are kept in touch with the shopfloor: \u201cThat will be a great benefit to Sports Direct, because it is very difficult sometimes when you\u2019re not involved with everything going on and not in touch with everything.

According to the attorney general\u2019s preliminary review of Mylan\u2019s sales contract with a local school system, its terms may have included \u201cpotentially anticompetitive terms\u201d. EpiPens are used to administer medication to someone experiencing anaphylaxis, which is an allergic reaction that causes airways to swell and close. \u201cNo child\u2019s life should be put at risk because a parent, school, or healthcare provider cannot afford a simple, life-saving device because of a drug-maker\u2019s anti-competitive practices,\u201d Schneiderman said on Tuesday. \u201cIf Mylan engaged in anti-competitive business practices, or violated antitrust laws with the intent and effect of limiting lower cost competition, we will hold them accountable. Allergy sufferers have enough concerns to worry about \u2013 the availability of life-saving medical treatment should not be one of them.\u201d A Mylan spokeswoman told the Guardian that the EpiPen4Schools program provides free EpiPens. \u201cThe program continues to adhere to all applicable laws and regulations. There are no purchase requirements for participation in the program, nor have there ever been to receive free EpiPen Auto-Injectors,\u201d she said in an emailed statement. \u201cPreviously, schools who wished to purchase EpiPen Auto-Injectors beyond those they were eligible to receive free under the program could elect to do so at a certain discount level with a limited purchase restriction, but such restriction no longer remains.\u201d Schneiderman is not the only one who wants Mylan and its CEO Heather Bresch to answer questions about its business practices. Shortly after the news about the EpiPen price hike spread, senators Susan Collins and Claire McCaskill requested that Bresch testify before the Senate special committee on aging. They asked that she appear within the next two weeks. The two weeks will be up on Thursday. Additionally, congressmen Jason Chaffetz and Elijah Cummings who sit on the US House oversight and reform committee requested that Bresch send over documents relating to the price hike. \u201cA national dependence on accessibility to EpiPens has been well established since Mylan\u2019s acquisition of the device in 2007. This command of the market has given Mylan the unbridled ability to increase the price of the two-pack EpiPen,\u201d they wrote. \u201cWhile families and schools are struggling to keep up with your company\u2019s unreasonable price increases, Mylan has profited richly from its pricing strategy.\u201d To help lawmakers understand the increasing costs of EpiPen, Mylan was to submit a briefing by 6pm on 6 September.

      "bodyText": "For Goldman Sachs, it was probably an easy hire to make. The bank needed a new chair for its London-based international operations, based in London. The UK had just voted for Brexit, creating complexities over passporting rights and so on. So send for Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, former head of the European commission, just the chap to guide the bank through the negotiation mash-up. Cue uproar among some of Barroso\u2019s former staff in Brussels. An online petition organised by \u201ca spontaneous group of employees of the European Institutions\u201d has damned him for joining the US investment bank and called for \u201cstrong exemplary measures,\u201d like removal of his pension. Almost 125,000 people have endorsed the view that Barroso\u2019s action is \u201cmorally reprehensible\u201d and has caused \u201cdishonour\u201d to the \u201cEuropean civil service and the European Union as a whole\u201d. Up to a point, one can agree. The revolving door between banks and senior bureaucrats and central bankers turns far too freely. Barroso waited only two months after the expiry of his 18-month cooling-off period before taking the Goldman gig. And Goldman, of course, is a bank alleged to have helped Greece to massage its books to get into the euro. Barroso knew the sensitivities and decided to take the job anyway. As a tale of gilded elites shuffling between public and private realms, it\u2019s a classic. Yet it\u2019s hard to believe the EU\u2019s ethical watchdog, prodded by the petition to ask a few questions, will manage a single bark. First, Barroso seems to have obeyed the rules. Second, if Goldman is off-limits, the commission would have to explain why European banks, retirement homes for other former top officials, are acceptable. Third, if the European commission really wanted to preach financial purity and transparency to the world, it would start by shining more light on the tax affairs of Luxembourg, home state of Barroso\u2019s successor, Jean-Claude Juncker. One suspects this entertaining affair is going nowhere. PPI saga runs and runs Is there anyone in the country who only just heard it is possible to claim compensation for mis-sold payment protection insurance (PPI)? Plenty of people, it seems. Complaints to the Financial Ombudsman are still rolling in at a rate of 3,000 a week. Some of these claims will be bogus, of course, as the banks keeping telling us. Not all will be, however, and the volume of complaints should make lenders understand why the Financial Conduct Authority was right to extend its proposed cut-off for claims to June 2019 rather than spring 2018. The principle of a cut-off is sensible because the PPI scandal, which has cost the industry \u00a337bn in claims and administration costs, cannot be allowed to run indefinitely. But legitimate claims still require time for proper consideration. The banks could have helped themselves by handling all claims properly but Lloyds Banking Group, for example, copped a heavy fine on that front last year. Regulatory sympathy will rightly be in short supply even as a few more billions are added to the final PPI bill. Startup loans come at a price Here\u2019s a subject for the Treasury select committee to chew over on a rainy day: at what rate is it acceptable for the government to lose money when lending to startup businesses? The question is prompted by the Press Association\u2019s revelation, via a freedom of information request, that 31% of the loans distributed by the government-backed startup loan scheme have been written off or are in arrears. In hard money, bad debts are \u00a372.4m out of \u00a3232m lent. In the commercial world, a bank would be on its knees if such a high proportion of loans, carrying an interest rate of 6%, failed. For this scheme, 31% is deemed perfectly acceptable: the ceiling rate for defaults is set at 40%. Indeed, the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy goes further, arguing the loans are \u201ccreating thousands of jobs and generating a return on investment to the economy of \u00a33 for every \u00a31 spent.\u201d That calculation, of course, deploys a very liberal definition of returns to include payroll taxes and the like. Perhaps that\u2019s fine if you are pursuing a policy goal of filling a gap in the market left by conventional banks, which was the justification for the launch of the scheme in 2012. All the same, discipline in lending is still meant to part of the mix. The line is thin between giving entrepreneurs a boost and throwing public money at worthy but unviable ventures. A default rate of 31% seems alarmingly high.",

Almost 125,000 people have endorsed the view that Barroso\u2019s action is \u201cmorally reprehensible\u201d and has caused \u201cdishonour\u201d to the \u201cEuropean civil service and the European Union as a whole\u201d.</p> <p>Up to a point, one can agree. The revolving door between banks and senior bureaucrats and central bankers turns far too freely. Barroso waited only two months after the expiry of his 18-month cooling-off period before taking the Goldman gig. And Goldman, of course, is a bank alleged to have helped Greece to massage its books to get into the euro. Barroso knew the sensitivities and decided to take the job anyway. As a tale of gilded elites shuffling between public and private realms, it\u2019s a classic.</p> <p>Yet it\u2019s hard to believe <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/06/eu-ethics-watchdog-intervenes-on-jose-manuel-barroso-goldman-job\">the EU\u2019s ethical watchdog</a>, prodded by the petition to ask a few questions, will manage a single bark. First, Barroso seems to have obeyed the rules. Second, if Goldman is off-limits, the commission would have to explain why European banks, retirement homes for other former top officials, are acceptable.</p> <p>Third, if the European commission really wanted to preach financial purity and transparency to the world, it would start by shining more light on the tax affairs of Luxembourg, home state of Barroso\u2019s successor, Jean-Claude Juncker. One suspects this entertaining affair is going nowhere.</p> <h2>PPI saga runs and runs</h2> <p>Is there anyone in the country who only just heard it is possible to claim compensation for mis-sold payment protection insurance (PPI)? Plenty of people, it seems. Complaints to the Financial Ombudsman are still <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/sep/06/financial-ombudsman-still-receiving-thousands-of-ppi-complaints\">rolling in at a rate of 3,000 a week</a>.<br></p> <p>Some of these claims will be bogus, of course, as the banks keeping telling us. Not all will be, however, and the volume of complaints should make lenders understand why the Financial Conduct Authority was right to extend its proposed cut-off for claims to June 2019 rather than spring 2018.</p> <p>The principle of a cut-off is sensible because the PPI scandal, which has cost the industry \u00a337bn in claims and administration costs, cannot be allowed to run indefinitely. But legitimate claims still require time for proper consideration. The banks could have helped themselves by handling all claims properly but Lloyds Banking Group, for example, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/04/lloyds-fine-mishandling-ppi-payouts-financial-conduct\">copped a heavy fine</a> on that front last year. Regulatory sympathy will rightly be in short supply even as a few more billions are added to the final PPI bill.</p> <h2>Startup loans come at a price</h2> <p>Here\u2019s a subject for the Treasury select committee to chew over on a rainy day: at what rate is it acceptable for the government to lose money when lending to startup businesses?</p> <p>The question is prompted by the <a href=\"https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/start-loans-scheme-sees-almost-122446202.html\">Press Association\u2019s revelation</a>, via a freedom of information request, that 31% of the loans distributed by the government-backed startup loan scheme have been written off or are in arrears.

      "bodyText": "The EU\u2019s ethics watchdog is to look into the former European commission president Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso\u2019s new job with Goldman Sachs, which includes advising the investment bank and its clients on Brexit. In a letter to Barroso\u2019s successor, Jean-Claude Juncker, the EU ombudsman, Emily O\u2019Reilly, said Barroso\u2019s appointment as non-executive chairman of Goldman raised widespread concerns. She cited \u201cunderstandable international attention given the importance of his former role and the global power, influence, and history of the bank with which he is now connected\u201d. Her intervention comes after EU staff launched a petition calling on EU institutions to take \u201cstrong exemplary measures\u201d against Barroso including the loss of his pension while he works for Goldman. The petition now has more than 120,000 signatures. O\u2019Reilly told Juncker that public unease will be exacerbated by the fact that Barroso is to advise Goldman Sachs on Britain\u2019s exit from the EU. She warned of the danger of a breach of ethics in his interaction with former colleagues, including the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, a former special adviser to Barroso. O\u2019Reilly said new guidance was needed to ensure that EU staff were \u201cnot affected by any possible failure on Mr Barroso\u2019s part to comply with his duty to act with integrity\u201d. Barroso joined Goldman less than two years after leaving office at the European commission, but after the 18-month cooling-off period stipulated by European rules. O\u2019Reilly said Barroso\u2019s case highlighted the \u201capparent arbitrariness\u201d of the 18-month period. \u201cCertain cases will not cease to be problematic simply because 18 months or longer has passed,\u201d she said. \u201cIt could therefore be more appropriate for the commission to decide on the merit of individual cases on a case-by-case basis taking into account all relevant issues and not just the quantity of time that has passed since a commissioner left office.\u201d She said this could include assessing the reputational damage that might have been caused by Barroso\u2019s move, even when no rules have been broken. O\u2019Reilly gave Juncker until 14 October to respond. A spokesperson for Goldman Sachs said: \u201cJos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso joined as chairman of Goldman Sachs International, he will also help advise our clients in Europe and around the world on a range of issues. \u201cThat decision had nothing to do with the outcome of the Brexit vote. Indeed, we began our discussions at a time when the prevailing view was that the remain campaign would succeed, an outcome we would have preferred and publicly supported.\u201d EU employees have reacted with fury to Barroso\u2019s move, starting a petition in which they described the Goldman appointment as morally reprehensible and called for it to be investigated. The petition said: \u201cThis decision to go and work for one of the banks most implicated in the subprime crisis that led to the financial crisis of 2007-2008 \u2013 the worst since the Great Depression \u2013 as well as one of the banks most involved in the Greek debt crisis, having helped Greece dissimulate its deficit before speculating in 2009-2010 against it in full knowledge of the unsustainability of its debt, is a further example of the irresponsible revolving-door practices, which are highly damaging to the EU institutions and, even if not illegal, morally reprehensible.\u201d The petition calls for \u201cstrong exemplary measures\u201d to be taken against Barroso, for behaviour that \u201cdishonours the European civil service and the European Union as a whole\u201d. Suggested measures include stripping Barroso of his EU pension and any honorary titles linked to his former office while he works for Goldman Sachs. A Goldman Sachs spokesman said last month that Barroso would not be making any comment. \u201cWe follow strict rules set by our global regulators in the hiring of ex-governmental officials. Jos\u00e9 Manuel took the role after an 18-month restriction period following the end of his term at the European commission, a longer period than that imposed by most European institutions.\u201d He added: \u201cJos\u00e9 Manuel\u2019s experience and advice in this time of uncertainty will be extremely valuable to our clients and their reaction to his appointment at Goldman Sachs has been very encouraging.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s been a good day for Sports Direct investors, as well as for workers who can wave goodbye to that hated Six-Strikes list of offences. Shares in the company just closed, up 5% today at 349p -- a level not seen since the Brexit vote -- as the City welcomes today\u2019s report into the \u2018serious shortcomings\u2019 at the sports retailer. That means Sports Direct is now worth \u00a32.083bn, by my calculations, up from \u00a31.98bn last night. And 55% of that increase has gone to Mike Ashley, who still owns more than half the company. The rally appears to be driven by optimism that Ashley is (belatedly) tackling its corporate governance failures, and put some of the Shirebrook scandal behind it. But that might be too optimistic; as we\u2019ve been covering through the day, unions, lawyers and commentators all fear that Sports Direct isn\u2019t going far enough. We have to wait another year for the new 360-degree assessment, announced today, to see how sweeping the company will be will be. In the meantime, the Shirebook agency workers will still be stuck on their old zero-hour contracts, meaning Ashley\u2019s dream of retail excellence is someway over the horizon. Wednesday will be another big day for Sports Direct, as it faces shareholders at its AGM. Will chairman Keith Hellawell be forced out? Will the media get some proper answers from Ashley (he\u2019s got a certain reputation for reticence with the press pack)? Tune in tomorrow to find out..... Our financial editor Nils Pratley has spoken - today\u2019s report is simply \u2018too tame\u2019, and lets Mike Ashley off too easily. Nils writes: Welcome news: Sports Direct and Mike Ashley have decided they will no longer defend the indefensible. The company acknowledges \u201cserious shortcomings\u201d in working practices at its Shirebrook warehouse that it \u201cdeeply regrets and apologises for\u201d. The notorious six strikes and you\u2019re out policy has been abandoned. Past payments below the minimum wage are described as \u201cunacceptable but unintentional\u201d. In stores, staff will be offered the chance to switch from zero-hours contracts to ones that guarantee 12 hours of employment a week. And Sports Direct is not saying the matter is closed: a fuller review of working practices and corporate governance will follow. Jolly good, but let\u2019s not pretend that this report is independent. It was written by one of the company\u2019s legal advisers Reynolds Porter Chamberlain, and sections and phrases read almost as if they were dictated by Ashley.... More here: Sky News\u2019s Mark Kleinman has an interesting story -- one of Sports Direct\u2019s landlords has insisted that the retailer commits to obey Britain\u2019s anti-slavery laws! Here\u2019s the details: One of the UK\u2019s biggest commercial property landlords has begun inserting anti-slavery clauses in tenancy contracts amid growing scrutiny of working practices at retailers including Sports Direct International. Sky News has learnt that Hermes Real Estate, an \u00a38.2bn property group which is part of Hermes Investment Management, recently told Sports Direct of its anger at working conditions for the chain\u2019s warehouse and shop-floor staff. Hermes Real Estate has also asked lawyers to include anti-slavery clauses in all new lease management contracts - although the provisions do not apply to existing tenancy agreements, according to people close to the situation. More here: Although CEO Dave Forsey gets plenty of criticism in today\u2019s Sports Direct report [as explained earlier] Mike Ashley avoids the blame bucket. Instead, the inquiry restricts itself to rather bland reminders that the company\u2019s founder (and driving force) can\u2019t be expected to know everything that\u2019s going on. For example, this section paints Ashley as a man with a commitment to excellence: Where there is rapid growth in lean structures and fast moving markets there is a greater strain placed on the business when it is trying to comply with its moral and legal obligations to its staff and the community. Growth businesses need to work harder to ensure that their working environment is and remains a healthy and productive one and even more so if it aspires to be one of the best places to work in retail, as stated by Mr Ashley. A fine aspiration, of course. But can you imagine John Lewis, Marks &amp; Spencer or Selfridges penalising staff for being ill or having to queue up and flash their underwear so guards can check they\u2019ve not nicked anything? That screeching noise you can hear is the pound hitting its highest level against the US dollar since the immediate aftermath of the Brexit vote. Sterling has jumped over $1.34, a seven week high, after new data showed an alarming slowdown in America\u2019s service sector. The US services PMI (which measure activity in the sector) slumped to 51.4, which means the slowest growth rate in six years. Economists expected a robust reading around 55.5, on a scale where 50 = stagnation. Reuters\u2019 ace Jamie McGeever has the details: Legal firm Leigh Day is worried that the thousands of agency workers up in Shirebrook may still suffer unacceptable working practices, despite today\u2019s pledges. Partner Emma Satyamurti says: \u201cHaving raised issues arising from the use of Zero Hours contracts in previous litigation against Sports Direct, we are pleased that today\u2019s report suggests the company has finally realised that its use of these types of contracts is problematic. However it remains to be seen when and how this new commitment will be implemented, and whether historic injustices will be addressed. \u201cWe remain concerned about the agency workers at Sports Direct\u2019s Shirebrook warehouse, as this group do not appear to benefit from the guaranteed hours commitment made in Sport Direct\u2019s media campaign launched ahead of tomorrow\u2019s AGM \u2013 this pledge appears to be limited to staff directly employed by Sports Direct. Leigh Day is already fighting a court case for Sports Direct workers who were excluded from its staff bonus scheme as they didn\u2019t hold permanent contracts, as Satyamurti explains: \u201cWe continue to represent 188 Sports Direct staff and ex-employees who missed out on bonuses because they were on zero hours contracts. Our clients, many of whom are long serving, worked hard to generate the large profits from which Sports Direct has benefited, yet were excluded from the bonus scheme run by the multi-billion pound company.\u201d Pressure continues to mount on Sports Direct\u2019s top brass. Leon Kamhi, head of responsibility at Hermes Investment Management (a SPD investor) has told Radio 4\u2019s The World at One that a new chairman is needed. Kamhi says Keith Hellawell should be replaced by a \u201cstrong, credible individual with experience of chairing a FTSE company\u201d. Sports Direct\u2019s chief executive, Dave Forsey, cops plenty of flak in today\u2019s report. For example, Forsey is criticised for not ensuring that the company actually has a proper contract with the agencies supplying thousands of workers.... During the oral evidence of Mr Ashley before the [BIS] Committee [ he was asked about whether he should know more about the contracts between Sports Direct and the Agencies. He observed that he couldn\u2019t know everything about every contract. These agreements were ultimately the responsibility of Dave Forsey (\u201cMr Forsey\u201d) as Chief Executive and others in the Retail Team who dealt with the Agencies on a day to day basis. In fact on investigation there appears to be no formal signed contract in place for either Agency. Effectively the terms and conditions are based on custom and practice and/or unsigned terms. Forsey is also blasted for allowing workers to be paid less than the national minimum wage (as they hang around to be searched at the end of their shift): At the management level Mr Forsey had failed to inform the Board (or Mr Ashley) of some of the issues namely the progress of the NMW issue in a timely or effective manner over the course of a year or so. Warning signs that had been given off by the media and to a lesser extent the Unions regarding NMW issues had not been heeded properly or adequately and so some points were not escalated. These sound like career-limiting mistakes for a CEO. But not, apparently, at Sports Direct -- Forsey is still in his role, but has been ordered to give up his \u00a33.6m bonus. Let\u2019s hope this is right.... It certainly makes a change from seeing a company\u2019s share price rise when it announces job cuts. But as flagged earlier, investors are also cheered by the prospect that SPD\u2019s corporate governance problems might be addressed.... The Breaking Views team at Reuters reckon today\u2019s changes won\u2019t satisfy City critics -- meaning tomorrow\u2019s Sports Direct AGM will be unmissable... The dire working practices at Sports Direct\u2019s warehouse have been a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre for Britain\u2019s unions. And two of the biggest unions aren\u2019t prepared to drop their concerns, just because the company has apologised and pledged to mend its ways. TUC General Secretary Frances O\u2019Grady has echoed Labour, by pushing for zero-hours contracts to be canned. \u201cAn apology is always a good start, but this is too little, too late. What we really need is an independent investigation, as called for by the trade union resolution at tomorrow\u2019s Sports Direct AGM. \u201cA report written by a law firm which previously represented Mike Ashley and management simply won\u2019t cut it. Sports Direct cannot be allowed to mark their own homework. \u201cCases like this show why the government must act to end the abuse of zero-hours contracts, and get serious on enforcing employment rights. The Unite union, which played a major role in uncovering the Sports Direct scandal, also wants Mike Ashley and co to do more - starting by curbing its use of agency staff. Assistant general secretary Steve Turner explains: Unite still has concerns over the use of the two employment agencies, The Best Connection and Transline, which supply over 3,400 workers to the Sports Direct Shirebrook warehouse. For Unite it has been their behaviour and the lack of oversight that has been the cause of so many of the abuses at Shirebrook. \u201cWe therefore call on Sports Direct to reconsider its proposal to only move 10 agency workers a month onto direct, permanent contracts. At that rate it will take over 340 months or 28 years for the whole of the agency workforce at Shirebrook to be moved on to secure, direct contracts. My colleague Simon Goodley is concerned that today\u2019s report neglects some serious issues. And he should know, having worked undercover at Sports Direct\u2019s warehouse last year. One key blindspot is that the report doesn\u2019t really question why SPD employs so many agency workers at all (rather than putting them on staff -- and guaranteeing them more rights). Simon writes: Sports Direct has never given a proper justification as to why it needs to employ the vast majority of warehouse staff on temporary contracts all year round. Some workers have been there for years on these \u201ctemporary\u201d arrangements, which even the report acknowledges are \u201carguably a form of \u201czero-hours contracts\u201d. Here\u2019s his full verdict: Every silver lining has a cloud..... The jump in Sports Direct\u2019s shares also shows the City welcomes its new review of corporate governance issues. That\u2019s been prompted by the build-up of criticism of chairman Keith Hellawell, who will face calls to resign at tomorrow\u2019s AGM. Bloomberg has a good take: The company is trying to assuage concerns of investors, who are running out of patience with the embattled company and its billionaire founder Mike Ashley. On Monday, Royal London Asset Management called for Hellawell to resign, saying that it will again oppose the reappointment of the company\u2019s non-executive directors. That followed public criticism by a group speaking for more than a quarter of independent shareholders. Hellawell has already enjoyed a dramatic career -- he\u2019s the former chief constable of West Yorkshire police, and also served as \u201cdrugs czar\u201d for the last Labour government. Shares in Sports Direct have jumped sharply this morning after the company announced it will improve its \u201cserious shortcomings\u201d. They are up 6% at 352p, putting them near the top of the FTSE 250 risers. That suggests City investors like the decision to end the six strikes policy, offer permanent contracts to its retail staff, pay staff above the minimum wage, and keep reviewing its working practices. The shares are now at their highest points since the Brexit vote in June, valuing SPD at just over \u00a32bn. However, they\u2019re still barely half their value last December (the month in which the Guardian exposed life in the Shirebrook \u2018gulag\u2019). The company fell out of the prestigious FTSE 100 index earlier this year, after hitting investors with a profit warning in January. The scandal of Sports Direct\u2019s working conditions are proof that zero hours contracts to be outlawed altogether, says the Labour Party. Jon Trickett, Labour\u2019s Shadow Business Secretary, says: \u201cThese are good steps forward from a company whose Dickensian working practices have shocked the country. I hope this isn\u2019t the last word from Mr Ashley, and that we can look forward to further such announcements in coming weeks, particularly regarding warehouse staff. \u201cBut we cannot rely on bad publicity to stamp out every instance of employers mistreating their staff. The Tory Government need to follow Labour\u2019s lead and commit to banning zero hours contracts and other exploitative practices in the workplace. \u201cSurely modern employers value their workforce as their most important asset. We have launched Workplace 2020 because we believe that profitable and efficient enterprises in the 21st Century can and should have up-to-date personnel practices including the right for the workforce to join a union.\u201d Here\u2019s more details on Workplace 2020, which Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn outlined in May. It\u2019s important to remember that Sports Direct isn\u2019t abolishing zero hours contracts for agency workers at its Shirebrook warehouse [today\u2019s offer of permanent contracts only applies to casual staff at its shops]. That\u2019s significant, as most staff in Derbyshire are employed by agencies, not SPD itself. The Resolution Foundation says we still need better protections for agency workers [who are often on the lowest wages with the least benefits]. Their policy analyst Conor D\u2019Arcy says: \u201cToday\u2019s report into working practices at Sports Direct highlights the pernicious effect of job insecurity on people\u2019s lives. \u201cThe move to offer guaranteed hours to staff on zero hours contracts is welcome and one that government should consider more widely, especially for those who have been on ZHCs for long periods of time. \u201cHowever, the fact that most staff at the Shirebrook warehouse are actually on agency books shows that there are many forms of employment contract at the bottom end of the British labour market that need closer scrutiny.\u201d Today\u2019s report may not take the heat off Sports Direct\u2019s chairman, Keith Hellawell. He\u2019s expected to face calls to resign tomorrow, when the company holds its annual shareholder meeting. Sky News\u2019s Charlotte Lomas predicts a \u2018fiery\u2019 encounter with investors. The government wants Sports Direct to crack on and implement today\u2019s report. A Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy spokesperson says: \u201cEverybody deserves to be treated with dignity and respect at work. \u201cAs its own report has recommended the company must now resolve its working practice issues as quickly as possible.\u201d Today\u2019s report is packed with changes to improve conditions at Sports Direct. Some of them sound pretty basic, frankly, for a \u00a32bn company that was recently in the FTSE 100. They include: No longer banning staff from wearing 800 different brands of sports wear (instead, they\u2019ll only be banned from wearing 30) A new confidential hotline for staff to report bullying and sexual harrassment A new review of the company\u2019s HR operations Appointing a full time nurse from 8am to 4pm (helpful for the next time anyone goes into labour onside), and a Welfare Officer Closer engagement with the unions, to help Sports Direct become an \u201cexemplary employer\u201d (that\u2019s the spirit, guys) Here\u2019s our full breakdown of the report: BIS committee chair Iain Wright MP has now told the Today Programme that Sports Direct needs to go further to get its house fully in order: Wright said: \u201cThis isn\u2019t a whitewash in terms of a report. \u201cThere are questions over the independence of the people who have done it, because it is Mike Ashley\u2019s lawyers who have published the report. \u201cIt has gone a long way but not far enough.\u201d Hopefully Wright\u2019s concerns will be addressed by the new review which SPD announced today. Sports Direct has also admitted that its policy of sacking staff who racked up six \u2018strikes\u2019 was flawed, and could allow workplace bullying. The board say: The business acknowledges that the six strikes policy in place as operated has serious shortcomings. It is a blunt instrument that can leave too much subjectivity in the hands of a few \u2013 contributing to a hierarchical and potentially oppressive model. The list of potential offences did include some measures to prevent accidents - to discourage workers from climbing up the warehouse racks or not wearing safety kit. But it also penalised staff who reported in sick, took too many toilet breaks, or were absent without permission. That meant staff were afraid to take time off when their children were ill, and led to one worker going into labour on site. Now, the SPD board want a new, fair system that \u201cbalances treating staff with dignity, respect and fairness and ensuring the business can deliver for its customers.\u201d So no more of this.... Sports Direct\u2019s board are promising to change the \u2018workforce balance\u2019 at its Shirebook warehouse, which is currently dominated by agency workers on contracts that only guarantee 336 hours work a year. It will run a test scheme to offer contracts to 10 agency staff each month (up from 2-per-month today). And it also wants its agencies to review those 336-hours-a-year contracts. Jonathan Bartley, the co-leader of the Green Party, has issued a statement welcoming Sports Directs decision to offer guaranteed hours to its casual retail staff. Bartley says: \u201cI\u2019m delighted to hear that Sports Direct, who I named and shamed in my speech to Green Party conference last week, are ending their use of zero-hour contracts and will now pay their staff a better wage - although we will have to wait and see whether the working conditions in warehouses improve too. \u201cThis kind of brutal employment practise exposes the razor sharp edges of the so-called \u2018gig economy\u2019, and this decision has not come a moment too soon.\u201d.... Bartley also hopes that other companies, whose working practices have been recently criticised, will follow Sports Direct. He singles out two firms facing protests from their drivers over new pay structures which could leave them receiving below the minimum wage: \u201cIt\u2019s time for companies like Deliveroo and Uber to follow suit by ending their use of bogus self-employment contracts and guaranteeing staff decent pay, sick leave and job security.\u201d Iain Wright MP, who chairs the Business, Innovation and Skills Select Committee (which quizzed Mike Ashley in June), has given today\u2019s report a cautious thumbs up: Labour MPs Angela Rayner and David Lammy are also upbeat: My colleague Sean Farrell is analysing the Sports Direct report, and says: The report said Sports Direct\u2019s chief executive, Dave Forsey, did not tell the board or Mike Ashley, the retailer\u2019s founder, about the potential for Sports Direct to pay below the national minimum wage, which was also uncovered by the Guardian. It said Ashley, who was hauled before MPs over conditions at the warehouse, \u201ctakes ultimate responsibility for any aspects of the working practices that were unsatisfactory\u201d. Here\u2019s his news story: Big news this morning -- Sports Direct has just published a report into working conditions at its warehouse in Shirebrook, Derbyshire, following a Guardian investigation. And the review, by City law firm Reynolds Porter Chamberlain, has confirmed that the site fell far below acceptable standards. As the report puts it, there are: Serious shortcomings identified in working practices in warehouse which the Board deeply regrets and apologises for. That\u2019s no surprise to anyone whose followed this story, or saw founder Mike Ashley accused of running a \u201cVictorian Warehouse\u201d. And the company is now promising to clean up its act. For starters...Sports Direct has requested that the notorious \u201csix strikes\u201d policy operated by the agencies who supply warehouse staff is suspended \u201cwith immediate effect\u201d. (that policy meant staff could incur \u2018strikes\u2019 for breaking petty rules, including taking too many toilet breaks or chatting too much). In another significant move, SPD will offer all its casual retail staff guaranteed hours instead of keeping them on \u2018zero hours\u2019. That doesn\u2019t appear to apply to warehouse staff, though -- who are usually employed via agencies. Also, it is committing to ensure that all warehouse staff are paid above National Minimum Wage. That was prompted by the revelation that workers endured security searches after their paid hours had finished. And that\u2019s not all -- Sports Direct is also launching a new inquiry into working conditions, to build on the findings released today. It says: This Report is to act as a benchmark for a further 360-degree 12-month Comprehensive Review to be put before shareholders in 2017. The full report is online here. It looks like a pretty significant reaction to the litany of problems exposed at Shirebrook. I\u2019ll pull together some reaction now.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It looks like another day dominated by concerns over the health of the global economy, and the impact of Brexit on UK growth. Overnight, the British Retail Consortium (BRC) has revealed that retail sales shrank last month. That suggests consumers are anxious; but actually it might be wrong to blame the EU vote, as Katie Allen explains: Olympics on the TV and sunshine outside kept shoppers away from the high street in August and knocked retail sales, according to new industry data. The latest snapshot of takings for shops, online stores and supermarkets from the British Retail Consortium (BRC) showed sales dropped 0.9% on a year earlier, in like-for-like terms. That contrasted with growth of 1.1% in July and was the weakest performance since April. But there were some bright spots for retailers as the warm weather boosted sales of barbecues and wine. Internationally, we\u2019ll chew through the latest German factory orders, updated eurozone growth figures (at 10am), plus US service sector PMIs this afternoon. And on the corporate side, UK housebuilders Redrow and Berkeley Group and cars-to-bikes chain Halfords are reporting results. We\u2019ll be tracking all the main developments through the day....",

The report, written by the City law firm Reynolds Porter Chamberlain and published on Tuesday (pdf), admitted \u201c[s]erious shortcomings \u2026 in working practices in [the] warehouse which the board deeply regrets and apologises for.\u201d It said policies were now in place to ensure all warehouse staff are paid above the national minimum wage, concluding that the previous breach of the legally required level, which led to Sports Direct having to offer \u00a31m in back pay to its warehouse staff, was \u201cunacceptable but unintentional.\u201d Sports Direct\u2019s board has also asked RPC to lead a further comprehensive review of working practices and corporate governance before next year\u2019s AGM and present findings to shareholders. The review will using the initial report as a benchmark to \u201cidentify what further action is required and to monitor steps already undertaken\u201d. The board also promised to engage with shareholders to get their views. Mike Ashley accepted that as founder and majority shareholder he \u201ctakes ultimate responsibility for any aspects of the working practices that were unsatisfactory, even where he is not in day-to-day control of these matters or had no knowledge of them\u201d. Its key points include: A \u201csix strikes\u201d policy on worker discipline, in which six infractions led to instant dismissal, will be suspended completely \u201cas soon as possible\u201d. The report said: \u201cIt is a blunt instrument that can leave too much subjectivity in the hands of a few\u201d and added that it had contributed to \u201ca hierarchical and potentially oppressive model that placed workers in an uncertain and difficult position.\u201d It said that, the combination of the strike system with contracts that guarantee only 336 hours work a year \u2013 less than six-and-a-half hours a week \u2013 meant agency staff could feel that could not complain. The six-strikes system will be replaced by a grievance and disciplinary procedure already used for Sports Direct\u2019s permanent employees. Other new systems will be considered in consultation with staff to \u201ccreate a fit for purpose system that balances treating staff with dignity, respect and fairness and ensuring the business can deliver for its customers\u201d. Deductions for clocking on one minute late have been changed from 15 minutes\u2019 worth of pay to five minutes, while if staff leave one minute early, this will be ignored. The moves are designed to ensure that deductions do not put workers on less than the minimum wage. Strict body searches carried out on warehouse workers will be reduced to just 16 workers per shift. The report found that minimum wage breaches were \u201cthe unintentional consequence of unpaid time that staff spent in queues at security bottlenecks\u201d. The report blames Sports Direct\u2019s chief executive, Dave Forsey, for Sports Direct paying less than the minimum wage. It says Forsey did not tell the board or Mike Ashley about the problems. Forsey gave up a bonus worth almost \u00a34m in June because of the scandal. Directly employed shop workers will be able to choose whether they want a zero-hours contract or a permanent contract with a guarantee of at least 12 hours a week. The report conceded \u201c \u2018zero hours\u2019 arrangements may be popular with many workers due to the flexibility they provide, (but) for others they are not attractive.\u201d Currently 18,250 retail staff are on zero-hours contracts. Only 5,037 of all Sports Direct staff are on permanent or part-time contracts \u2013 including all those working in head office and the warehouse. The company will consider a test scheme at its warehouse to transfer 10 agency workers a month to the Sports Direct payroll. There are currently 4,099 warehouse workers on agency contracts that only guarantee 336 hours a year. Only 400 warehouse staff are employed directly by the company. The report says only about two people a month transfer from agencies on to the permanent staff. The report calls for the agencies used by Sports Direct to review the nature of the contracts they use for workers, but it adds: \u201cIt is not for SD to dictate the terms and conditions of the agencies that are used across their large workforce with many other customers.\u201d There is currently no formal signed contract in place between Sports Direct and either of the two employment agencies it works with. \u201cThis is a serious failing given the importance of these agreements in relation to employment practices and their financial value,\u201d the report says. Serious shortcomings were acknowledged in the way that the company handled human resourses issues and working practices in its warehouses, during what the report described as a \u201cperiod of extreme growth\u201d. It said there had been an \u201cunhelpful demarcation\u201d between Sports Direct\u2019s HR team and those looking after agency staff in the warehouse leading to too little communication. The report found there was also communication problems within Sports Direct\u2019s management while communication within the warehouse was also difficult owing to \u201clanguage issues\u201d. Training will be provided for supervisors in the warehouse \u201cto ensure there should be no culture of fear\u201d. The report promised strict enforcement of Sports Direct\u2019s \u201czero tolerance policy of sexual harassment\u201d with a confidential reporting system for any victims. Staff will be given external training where required to ensure good practice. A full-time nurse and a welfare officer will be recruited to the HR team at Shirebrook . This move was prompted by reports that ambulances had been called to Shirebrook 110 times in three years and one employee had given birth in a toilet. A welfare budget will also be created to provide contingency funds, in case \u201curgent need arises to provide discretionary help and assistance to an individual.\u201d The report stopped short of recommending the recognition of collective bargaining by workers, but in a section titled \u201cengagement with trade unions\u201d it said the board said it welcomed \u201cconstructive and open dialogue \u2026 to allow all parties to focus on Sports Direct becoming an exemplary employer\u201d. A dress code that banned workers from wearing clothes from a list of 800 brands \u201cbecause of the risk that it could contribute to thefts from the warehouse\u201d has been cut back to a list of just 30 brands. The report said the 800-brand ban was \u201cheavy handed\u201d. RPC said it \u201cwas apparent ... there remains a commitment from the business and Ashley personally, to be transparent and properly investigate and then address any issues.\u201d The lawyers claimed that conditions in the warehouse have already improved.",

      "bodyText": "Strong export sales saved the eurozone from stagnation in the second quarter of the year as investment slowed and domestic consumers held back on spending. Figures showed exports from the 19-member currency bloc increased 1.1%, after stagnating in the first quarter. But this surge in sales abroad was offset by flat investment, reduced stockpiles of goods, stalled government spending and only marginally higher consumer spending that restricted the overall growth rate to 0.3%. Economists said the lack of a strong impetus from domestic spending would likely to put pressure on European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi to ramp up his support for the eurozone economy when he holds a press conference on Thursday. Karen Ward, chief European economist at HSBC, said the more detailed breakdown of GDP growth in the latest figures showed that consumer spending, the key driver of growth for much of the last eighteen months, slowed as the boost from ow oil prices faded. \u201cInvestment is likely to remain lacklustre due to weak global trade and political uncertainty including Brexit. So the second half of the year is likely to be sluggish,\u201d she said. The UK\u2019s referendum vote, a series of terrorist incidents and the ongoing refugee crisis have made consumers in the eurozone wary of making large purchases and a broad slowdown in global trade is likely to dent exports. But the German and French governments are not expected to boost spending ahead of general elections next year, leaving consumers and export industries to generate growth. Germany, which has reported a record trade surplus for the last year, has already planned a balanced budget for 2017 that will do little to boost much-needed public infrastructure investment. France, which has limited scope to boost spending without further breaching EU budget rules, has attempted to increase employment and GDP growth through a series of liberalising reforms. Bert Colijn, senior eurozone economist at ING Financial Markets, said with exports to important trading partners like the UK under pressure, the eurozone had \u201clittle left in the tank to boost growth in the final months of the year\u201d. He said: \u201cConsumption could recover somewhat, but no miracles can be expected with weakening employment growth. It therefore seems likely that growth will slow down somewhat further in the months ahead.\u201d Overall, the eurozone economy grew by 0.3% in the three months to the end of June, in line with preliminary estimates and by 1.6% over the previous year. Growth in the first quarter was revised down a touch to 0.5% from 0.6% and economists predicted that the rest of the year would prove tough going for businesses and household spending. Howard Archer, chief European economist at IHS Global Insight, said the 1.5% growth he has pencilled in for this year would not be repeated in 2017, when growth was forecast to drop to 1.2%. Draghi will give his verdict on the latest eurozone figures on Thursday at the ECB\u2019s regular press conference in Frankfurt. Ewen Cameron Watt, senior director at BlackRock Investment Institute, said Draghi should pump more funds into the eurozone economy and widen the number of tools used by the ECB to counter a slowdown over the next year.",

The company acknowledges \u201cserious shortcomings\u201d in working practices at its Shirebrook warehouse that it \u201cdeeply regrets and apologises for\u201d. The notorious six strikes and you\u2019re out policy has been abandoned. Past payments below the minimum wage are described as \u201cunacceptable but unintentional\u201d.

It was written by one of the company\u2019s legal advisers Reynolds Porter Chamberlain, and sections and phrases read almost as if they were dictated by Ashley. \u201cIronically, these failings occurred against a backdrop of a genuine intention on behalf of SDI [Sports Direct] to ensure its permanently employed staff were well remunerated, as evidenced by the fact that about \u00a3250m in bonuses has been paid to eligible permanent employees,\u201d says one passage. No, no, Reynolds Porter, there is nothing ironic or unintentional about the contrast between Sports Direct\u2019s treatment of 85% of its workers, those on agency and zero-hours contracts, and its willingness to shower bonuses on others. It appears to have been part of a deliberate policy to maximise rewards at the top by squeezing those at the bottom. A more independently minded report could have used the words \u201cwretchedly\u201d or \u201cdisgracefully\u201d instead of \u201cironically\u201d. In a similar vein, it\u2019s startling to hear that only one person, the chief executive, Dave Forsey, is to blame. \u201cAt the management level, Mr Forsey had failed to inform the Board (or Mr Ashley) of some of the issues namely the progress of the NMW [national minimum wage] issue in a timely or effective manner over the course of a year or so,\u201d says the report. Too shallow. Concerns about Shirebrook had been aired for years, not least by the Unite union. Protests were staged even before the Guardian\u2019s investigation last year. A well-functioning board would have smelled danger and investigated. Instead, the most remarkable fact produced by Reynolds Porter is that the two employment agencies supplying Sports Direct with 4,000 workers still don\u2019t have a contract and instead work on \u201ccustom and practice and/or unsigned terms\u201d. It is a \u201cserious failing\u201d, Sports Direct accepts. You bet. On the ground, it is hard to believe that the security bottlenecks at Shirebrook, which led to the minimum wage breaches, could have escaped the notice of Ashley, a famously hands-on operator who is chief executive in all but job title. Blaming Forsey, and removing his \u00a33.6m share bonus, feels terribly convenient. But it may suit Sports Direct\u2019s purposes if the aim is to escape a shakeup of the boardroom, including a new chairman to replace the hapless Keith Hellawell. The tone of this report, including some silly side swipes at Unite (which was basically correct in its portrayal of life inside Shirebrook), amounts to a plea for the current board to be given more time to complete reform on its terms. Ashley loyalists might argue that since he owns 55% of the shares, he\u2019s entitled to do what he wants. Outside shareholders contemplating how to vote on a number of resolutions at Wednesday\u2019s annual meeting, including the re-election of Hellawell and the need for a fully independent review, should look at the evidence. The current crew of non-executives plainly failed to hold management to account and was deaf to concerns until forced to listen by the Guardian and subsequent parliamentary inquiry. The question for minority shareholders is who would be best placed to enforce the company\u2019s new ambition to be \u201can exemplary employer\u201d. Common sense says genuinely independent newcomers should replace the current timid and long-serving lineup. Ashley, if he chooses, can roll out his stake and protect Hellawell indefinitely, even if outsiders give the former police officer the thumbs down. But Ashley might reflect that insular bloodymindedness, which served Sports Direct well in its pre-stock market days, when it was fighting a hostile club of sportswear retailers, is no longer a good look. Even Tuesday\u2019s modest rush of fresh air, courtesy of a report by a tame legal firm, sent the share price up 6%. A proper blast of oxygen, delivered by a reformed board, might do wonders for Ashley\u2019s wealth. One suspects that he\u2019ll be loyal to Hellawell et al until the end \u2013 but the loyalty is misplaced.",

      "bodyText": "A cross-party group of MPs is claiming a victory for corporate tax transparency after the government accepted a legal amendment that could force multinationals to publicly declare where they do business and the tax they pay. Drawn up by the Labour MP Caroline Flint and supported by more than 60 MPs, the amendment to the finance bill would give the Treasury power to seek more openness on tax from corporations with significant activities in the UK. The amendment says tax information should include a \u201ccountry-by-country report\u201d, showing what revenues are earned in which nation. It comes in the wake of the landmark ruling of the European commission to order Apple to pay back up to \u20ac13bn (\u00a311bn) in taxes to Ireland. The government accepted the amendment on Monday evening, said Flint, a member of the public accounts committee, which has criticised the tax affairs of companies including Google. Flint said she was \u201cdelighted that the government and the Commons has accepted the principle of public country-by-country reporting\u201d. She said: \u201cToday is a victory for fairer taxation. A victory for openness, and a clear message to those global corporations that shift profits to low tax havens, that we expect them to play by the same rules as every other business.\u201d Among the MPs to back the amendment was the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, the current and former chairs of the public accounts committee, Meg Hillier and Margaret Hodge, and Conservative members of the committee. During her campaign to become leader of the Conservatives, Theresa May had promised to be tough on tax evasion and avoidance. Other MPs supporting the amendment include members of the Scottish National party, the Ulster Unionist party, the Social Democratic and Labour party, Plaid Cymru and the Liberal Democrats. The amendment was first introduced by Flint in March under the Ten Minute Rule, a form of private member\u2019s bill which allows individual MPs to propose their own legislation. This was followed by a formal amendment while the finance bill was at the committee stage in the Commons which proposed that multinationals based in the UK or with a large presence there should make public information about the size of their profits, where they were made and what taxes they paid. They already provide this information to tax authorities, but the idea of the amendment is that making this public could help put pressure on corporations to change their behaviour. Flint said: \u201cThe UK government now has yet another tool to use in the campaign against profit shifting that undermines our country and many others, not least some of the poorest in the world.\u201d",
