      "bodyText": "The delivery company Hermes faces a legal battle with a group of its own drivers today, in the latest case promising to have major ramifications on labour rights in the growing gig economy. The move follows similar recent hearings on how companies, including the ride-hailing firm Uber, engage gig economy workers, so-called because employees are paid in return for the \u201cgigs\u201d they perform. The new action due to open at an employment tribunal in Leeds today has been brought by eight couriers at Hermes, which delivers packages for retailers such as Next, Asos, John Lewis, Topshop and River Island. The drivers claim they are being denied basic workers\u2019 rights by being forced to declare as self-employed, meaning they are not entitled to holiday pay or to be paid the legal minimum hourly rate under the national living wage. The rival delivery firm DPD last month offered all of its drivers drivers sick and holiday pay as part of wholesale reforms to its gig working model sparked by the death of a driver it charged for attending a medical appointment to treat his diabetes and who later collapsed and died. The Hermes claim mirrors several other similar tribunal hearings \u2013 including verdicts in cases brought against Uber, Addison Lee, City Sprint, Excel and eCourier \u2013 where judges have ruled that the staff should be given the legal classification as \u201cworkers\u201d, thereby receiving the minimum wage and holiday pay rights. In 2016 the ride-hailing firm Uber was told its drivers should be classed as \u201cworkers\u201d with minimum-wage rights. Uber, which says its drivers are self-employed, lost its appeal against the decision last year but said it would appeal again. The case could end up in the supreme court this year. Tim Roache, the general secretary of the GMB union, which has been involved in bringing the Hermes claim, said: \u201cGMB\u2019s courier members do a tough job \u2013 working long hours with unrealistic targets. They make a fortune for companies like Hermes, the least they should be able to expect in return is the minimum wage and their hard-fought rights at work. \u201cCompanies like Hermes and Uber hide behind terms like \u2018flexibility\u2019 to wriggle out of treating the people who make them their money with the respect they deserve. \u201cGuaranteed hours, holiday pay, sick pay, pension contributions are not privileges companies can dish out when they fancy. They are the legal right of all UK workers and that\u2019s what we\u2019re asking the courts to rule on.\u201d In February Theresa May announced a number of new labour policies that she said would mean \u201ctangible progress\u201d towards upholding workers\u2019 rights, in response to a Downing Street-commissioned review by Matthew Taylor. However, there was disappointment from workers, trade unions and Labour that the government has only pledged to consult on possible changes to the use of self-employment, which may not include changing the law. Hermes did not comment. Uber said that in a survey of its drivers conducted in September, 80% said they wished to remain working as an independent contractor.",

      "bodyText": "Sainsbury\u2019s and Asda will confirm on Monday the details of a \u00a315bn merger creating a new grocery superpower that would ring up nearly \u00a31 in every \u00a33 spent on groceries on the UK high street. The shock deal was revealed on Saturday and immediately triggered fears of thousands of job losses. The pair have a combined workforce of 360,000 people and the merged company would leapfrog Tesco to become the UK\u2019s biggest private sector employer. Joe Clarke, the acting national officer of the United union, described the deal as an \u201cabsolute shocker\u201d with \u201cimplications for tens of thousands of jobs\u201d. Staff were in \u201cutter disarray\u201d, he said, adding: \u201cStaff are already facing uncertainty through restructuring and changes to contracts at [Sainsbury\u2019s]. Sainsbury\u2019s bosses need to give workers clarity over what the future could hold and assurances over jobs as matter of urgency.\u201d A merger of the UK\u2019s second and third largest retailers raises huge competition concerns, with industry insiders saying the tie-up would effectively create a \u201cduopoly\u201d, as the enlarged Sainsbury\u2019s and Tesco would control nearly 60% of the UK grocery retail market. The deal will trigger a major retail competition inquiry, the likes of which has not seen since Morrisons moved on Safeway in 2003. Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat leader, said the proposed merger could create \u201ceven more concentrated local monopolies\u201d and challenged Andrew Tyrie, the incoming boss of the Competition and Markets Authority regulator, to reverse a history of \u201cspineless\u201d inquiries by conducting a robust investigation. \u201cThis is an early test for Andrew Tyrie and an important one,\u201d Cable said. \u201cThe CMA really needs to show some teeth after previously being soft in its remedies in the audit, banking and energy sectors.\u201d Last year, the CMA waved through Tesco\u2019s \u00a33.7bn takeover of cash-and-carry group Booker despite warning by rivals it could drive them out of business Andrew Simms, the co-director of the New Weather Institute thinktank and the author of Tescopoly, said: \u201cThis is profoundly not in the public interest. It\u2019s going to have negative consequences for consumers and all the along the grocery supply chain.\u201d Minette Batters, the president of the National Farmers\u2019 Union, said: \u201c[The CMA] must take into account the impact of changes to supplier arrangements that could give rise to reductions in choice.\u201d Sainsbury\u2019s will publish a statement fleshing out the terms of the agreement on Monday morning at 7am. The shares-based deal is expected to create a combined company worth \u00a315bn including debt, led by current Sainsbury\u2019s boss Mike Coupe. It is envisaged that his opposite number at Asda, Roger Burnley, will report to Coupe. The proposed new retail giant will have 2,800 stores and annual sales of more than \u00a350bn. The plan is to retain both retail brands because they have different heartlands and attract different sorts of shoppers. One senior industry source said that Walmart had been trying to sell the struggling Asda chain for some time. The deal brokered with Sainsbury was, he said, evidence the US retailer was \u201cflying the white flag\u201d after failing to conquer the UK market during the near two decades it has owned the Leeds-based grocer. Talks between the two businesses have been going on for more than a year, with the deal based on pooling buying power to offer lower prices at the checkout \u2013 rather than closing stores or cutting jobs. The Qatar Investment Authority, the sovereign wealth fund that is currently Sainsbury\u2019s biggest shareholder, is said to be supportive of the plan. It is thought the CMA has already been in advanced discussions with Sainsbury\u2019s and Asda as the regulator\u2019s guidance states that \u201cbusinesses are strongly encouraged to approach the CMA to discuss their merger ... on a confidential basis\u201d before formally notifying the regulator. However, one senior supermarket executive said the deal would be a hard sell to the regulator, saying: \u201cThis will be much more difficult to get through than the Tesco/Booker deal as it will effectively create a duopoly with 60% of the UK grocery market. Last time they made it very clear that the big four [supermarkets] could not become three. It will be a long and challenging process to win approval and could force a lot of store disposals.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Retro 90s fashion is a huge trend on the high street at the moment but that nostalgia has now spilled over into food retail as the supermarket giant Sainsbury\u2019s attempts a blockbuster deal that will result in it seizing back the UK grocery crown it surrendered to Tesco in 1995. The UK\u2019s second-largest retailer has confirmed plans to merge with its nearest rival Asda in a \u00a315bn deal that will create a mega-grocer with sales of more than \u00a350bn and 2,800 stores. The details of the merger will be spelled out in a Stock Exchange announcement on Monday morning but analysts have already spent the weekend crunching the numbers after the news leaked out on a grey Saturday afternoon. The Bernstein analyst Bruno Monteyne predicts the supermarket bosses could carve out cost savings of \u00a3600m on the back of the deal. The huge figure could mean heavy job losses at the two companies, which have already endured multiple rounds of head office and shopfloor cuts against a backdrop of an intensifying supermarket price war with the German discounters Aldi and Lidl. With a combined workforce of 360,000 and potentially hundreds of overlapping stores, retail experts predict seismic changes on the horizon as a result of the deal. It will automatically trigger a competition probe, which history suggests could force store sell-offs in a tough retail climate where there are likely to be fewer buyers than during more buoyant economic times when there was a space race among the big supermarket chains. Monteyne says the two retailers have different fortes that will enable them to improve the other\u2019s performance: \u201cAsda has been struggling in the UK to deal with both the threat of discounters and the growth of e-commerce, particularly in non-food,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is also weak in private label, the biggest battlefield against discounters. Both of these are areas that Sainsbury\u2019s excels in. Sainsbury\u2019s weakness is pricing.\u201d If the deal goes ahead, Walmart, which has owned Asda since 1999, will receive Sainsbury\u2019s shares in exchange for Asda\u2019s circa 600 supermarkets, becoming the company\u2019s biggest shareholder. The combined group is expected to have a market value of \u00a315bn, including debt. The deal understandably raises competition concerns. The enlarged Sainsbury\u2019s group would have a huge share of the market in food, clothing, household goods and toy retailing. Sainsbury\u2019s also owns the 800-store Argos chain while Asda\u2019s assets include the George clothing and homewares brand, which is a major player at the no frills end of the market. The most recent grocery market share data from the retail experts Kantar Worldpanel puts Tesco, the UK\u2019s longstanding No 1, in the lead with 27.6%. Sainsbury\u2019s and Asda command shares of 15.8% and 15.6% respectively, which means the combined business would ring up more 31.4% of UK grocery sales. Before the deal can be given a green light, economists at the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) are expected to spend months poring over a map of the combined group\u2019s store network. They will scrutinise every location and test whether the choice of retailers, typically within a 10- to-15-minute drive of each other, is materially reduced by the deal. In areas where there is only an Asda and a Sainsbury\u2019s, regulators would be expected demand disposals. The 2003 competition investigation into the Safeway deal took five months and eventually forced Morrisons to sell off 53 stores but retail experts predict assessing the competition implications of merging the UK\u2019s second and third biggest retailer could take up to a year to do. The overlap between the two grocers\u2019 stores is less than with other rivals because Sainsbury\u2019s traditional heartland is the south-east while Leeds-based Asda is a major player in the north of the country. However, the TCC Global analyst, Bryan Roberts, says the number of affected stores could still be substantial. \u201cIt would be miraculous if there was less than a 100 places where you have got an Asda and a Sainsbury\u2019s in close proximity,\u201d he says. \u201cA lot depends on the CMA and whether they reevaluate what competition means, given the growth of Aldi and Lidl as well as online.\u201d The north-south divide between Asda and Sainsbury\u2019s is also about more than geography as the two companies are culturally very different. Unlike Morrisons\u2019 takeover of Safeway in the noughties, there are no plans to ditch either brand, a rationale explained by the lack of overlap in the demographics of their customer bases. While Asda, with its focus on everyday low prices, targets shoppers on tight budgets, Sainsbury\u2019s aisles are a destination for the middle-classes with more emphasis on ethical sourcing and foodie treats. \u201cYou could not get two more different businesses and bringing them together will be a Herculean task,\u201d concludes Roberts.",

      "bodyText": "Saudi Aramco, the world\u2019s most profitable company, has appointed a woman to its board, in a milestone move for Saudi Arabia, where only one-fifth of women work and there are very few female executives. The oil company, which made profits of $33.8bn (\u00a325bn) in the first half of 2017 \u2013 $5bn more than second-placed Apple \u2013 said on Sunday it had recruited the American oil executive Lynn Laverty Elsenhans to its 11-member board. The appointment of Elsenhans, a former chief executive and chair of US oil refiner Sunoco, comes as the Saudi Arabian government prepares to float Saudi Aramco later this year or early in 2019. The initial public offering, which could take place in London, New York or Hong Kong, will be the world\u2019s largest. Only a handful of Saudi women are appointed to the board of major Saudi companies, but that is slowly changing in the conservative kingdom, where women are subject to a male guardianship system that in many cases restricts their opportunities to work. The Saudi government has set a target of increasing female participation in the workforce from 22% to 30% by 2030. Last year, the Saudi stock exchange appointed Sarah al-Suhaimi as its first female chair. She was the first woman to chair a major government financial institution in the kingdom. Elsenhans was named by Forbes magazine as one of the world\u2019s most powerful women in 2008. Prior to her role at Sunoco, Elsenhans was a senior executive at Royal Dutch Shell, where she worked for more than 28 years. She also sits on the board of GlaxoSmithKline. Also joining Aramco\u2019s board are the Saudi Arabian minister of finance, Mohammed al-Jadaan; the economy minister, Mohammed al-Tuwaijri; Peter Cella, the former president and chief executive of Chevron Phillips Chemicals; and Andrew Liveris, the chief executive of the Dow Chemical Company. The five new members of Aramco\u2019s board will join six returning members, including the Saudi energy minister, Khalid al-Falih, who is also Aramco\u2019s chairman, and Amin Nasser, Aramco\u2019s chief executive. Ibrahim al-Assaf, a minister of state, and the managing director of the government-owned Public Investment Fund, Yasir al-Rumayyan, also remain on the board.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Theresa May is right. Britain\u2019s housing market is broken and needs fixing. Homelessness and rough sleeping are rising and owner-occupation levels for the young have collapsed because homes have become unaffordable. The average private rent in London accounts for more than a third of household income. The bill for housing benefit has risen eight-fold since the early 1980s after inflation is taken into account. House building has risen since the lows reached during the financial crisis of a decade ago but needs to almost double to hit the government\u2019s target of 300,000 new homes a year by the middle of the next decade. Yes, the housing market is broken all right and for the Conservatives, a party that sees itself as the party of the homeowner, it is a serious political headache. A crisis has been brewing for decades \u2013 and left unattended the problem can only get worse. Britain has a rising population and the trend is for smaller households, both of which mean demand for housing will keep on rising. The weak growth figures for the first three months of 2018 will keep borrowing costs on hold for now but sooner or later the Bank of England will raise interest rates. That will make it still harder for people in their 20s to get a foot on the housing ladder. Yet sketching out the problem is one thing. Coming up with solutions is trickier. Replace a regressive council tax with a land value tax? Labour is thinking about a LVT but there is no chance the Conservatives will introduce what they have dubbed a \u201cgarden tax\u201d that would hit millions. How about giving some of the anonymous farmland in the green belt over to housing development? The thin end of a wedge that will result in the south-east being turned into one big urban sprawl. Make prime residences eligible for capital gains tax? Are you kidding? Politicians know that Britain\u2019s housing market is broken but mess with it at their peril. The problem is so big, however, that changes have to come. London\u2019s mayor, Sadiq Khan, wants to increase the supply of lower-cost homes in the capital, so under City Hall guidelines private development proposals where affordable units make up at least 35% of the total will be fast-tracked through the planning process. Under 35%, and developers can expect a much tougher time. But as Daniel Bentley argues in a new pamphlet for the thinktank Civitas, the problem goes deeper than the planning system. Forcing councils to grant more planning permissions in high-demand areas doesn\u2019t guarantee that the supply of new homes will markedly increase. The reason for that, Bentley says, goes back to the 1961 Land Compensation Act passed by Harold Macmillan\u2019s government. This enshrined in law the right of landowners, in the event of compulsory purchase, to be reimbursed not only for the value of their land as it stood but for its potential value if it were used for something else in the future. A system so heavily weighted in favour of landowners had two consequences. First, it provided them with an incentive to wait, often for years, before selling their land for development because they would get a higher price. Second, house-builders had to recoup the costs of buying the land and did so by building more expensive properties that were drip-fed into the market to keep selling prices high. If the aim is to build more affordable homes, this makes no sense. A site with planning permission for housing is worth more than a brownfield industrial site and 100 times more than agricultural land. Research by Thomas Aubrey of the Centre for Progressive Policy found that landowners made windfall profits of more than \u00a39bn in 2014-15 on the sale of land. That meant for every home built that year, an average of \u00a360,000 went to the landowner. Bentley says the entitlement of landowners to this \u201chope value\u201d, the prospect that it will be worth a lot more if used for something else, means public authorities are powerless to enforce development priorities that are in the interests of the community. \u201cThis was not always the case. The new towns that were initiated before the 1961 act, and much of the local-authority output of the late 1940s and 1950s, was underpinned by a land values policy that meant landowners were compensated at values reflecting the existing use of the site,\u201d he said. \u201cThis meant land for new homes could be acquired at or close to its much lower agricultural or industrial use values. It also doused speculation and prevented the withholding of land.\u201d Reforming the 1961 act so that public-sector bodies can purchase land at less than its prospective residential use value makes sense because it would enable developers to get hold of land more cheaply and so build more affordable homes. Nor would it be an especially controversial move politically. Judging by their 2017 manifestos, Labour and the Conservatives think the current system is weighted too heavily in favour of landowners, who see the value of their holdings increase not through their own efforts but through those of others.

So was Henry George, who the left laud for coming up with the LVT. May should seek bipartisan support for a rethink of the 1961 act. Sure, Conservative-supporting landowners would object but if the prime minister is to make good on her pledge to fix the housing market she has to side with the many not the few.",

The bill for housing benefit has risen eight-fold since the early 1980s after inflation is taken into account.

Britain has a rising population and the trend is for smaller households, both of which mean demand for housing will keep on rising. <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/27/uk-gdp-growth-rate-slows-first-quarter\">The weak growth figures for the first three months of 2018 </a>will keep borrowing costs on hold for now but sooner or later the Bank of England will raise interest rates. That will make it still harder for people in their 20s to get a foot on the housing ladder.</p> <p>Yet sketching out the problem is one thing. Coming up with solutions is trickier.</p> <p>Replace a regressive council tax with a land value tax? <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/feb/22/labour-says-land-value-tax-would-boost-local-government-budgets\">Labour is thinking about a LVT</a> but there is no chance the Conservatives will introduce what they have dubbed a \u201cgarden tax\u201d that would hit millions. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>How about giving some of the anonymous farmland in the green belt over to housing development? The thin end of a wedge that will result in the south-east being turned into one big urban sprawl.</p> <p> Make prime residences eligible for capital gains tax? Are you kidding? Politicians know that Britain\u2019s housing market is broken but mess with it at their peril.</p> <p>The problem is so big, however, that changes have to come. London\u2019s mayor, Sadiq Khan, wants to increase the supply of lower-cost homes in the capital, so under City Hall guidelines <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/nov/29/london-mayor-sadiq-khan-35-affordable-homes-target-deal-developers\">private development proposals where affordable units make up at least 35% of the total will be fast-tracked through the planning process.</a> Under 35%, and developers can expect a much tougher time.</p> <p>But as Daniel Bentley argues in <a href=\"http://www.civitas.org.uk/publications/the-land-question/\">a new pamphlet for the thinktank Civitas</a>, the problem goes deeper than the planning system. Forcing councils to grant more planning permissions in high-demand areas doesn\u2019t guarantee that the supply of new homes will markedly increase.</p> <p>The reason for that, Bentley says, goes back to the 1961 Land Compensation Act passed by Harold Macmillan\u2019s government. This enshrined in law the right of landowners, in the event of compulsory purchase, to be reimbursed not only for the value of their land as it stood but for its potential value if it were used for something else in the future.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>A system so heavily weighted in favour of landowners had two consequences. First, it provided them with an incentive to wait, often for years, before selling their land for development because they would get a higher price. Second, house-builders had to recoup the costs of buying the land and did so by building more expensive properties that were drip-fed into the market to keep selling prices high.</p> <p>If the aim is to build more affordable homes, this makes no sense. A site with planning permission for housing is worth more than a brownfield industrial site and 100 times more than agricultural land. Research by Thomas Aubrey of the Centre for Progressive Policy found that landowners made windfall profits of more than \u00a39bn in 2014-15 on the sale of land. That meant for every home built that year, an average of \u00a360,000 went to the landowner.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Guardian business email sign-up\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Bentley says the entitlement of landowners to this \u201chope value\u201d, the prospect that it will be worth a lot more if used for something else, means public authorities are powerless to enforce development priorities that are in the interests of the community. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cThis was not always the case. The new towns that were initiated before the 1961 act, and much of the local-authority output of the late 1940s and 1950s, was underpinned by a land values policy that meant landowners were compensated at values reflecting the existing use of the site,\u201d he said. </p> <p>\u201cThis meant land for new homes could be acquired at or close to its much lower agricultural or industrial use values.

      "bodyText": "It was all so different for Paul Pester last December. Unveiling TSB\u2019s new banking platform, he claimed that it had created \u201ca more digital, agile and flexible TSB\u201d. Before last weekend\u2019s switch to the new system, TSB\u2019s press office said that almost everything was running on the new platform; there was only the little matter of transferring 1.3bn account details for 5 million customers, and all would be done. Now, Pester finds himself presiding over another example of a great British IT failure. In the same week, outsourcing company Capita, which has had problems with contracts with GP surgeries and London\u2019s congestion charge, said it was seeking a \u00a3701m rights issue as part of an overhaul that includes rebuilding its technology and IT infrastructure. Meanwhile, the government has found itself in even further trouble over the Windrush scandal due to the Home Office\u2019s inability to digitise a set of landing cards from 70 years ago. And that\u2019s before we talk about the stuttering, long-delayed rollout of universal credit. Is it that Britain is just bad at IT projects? You don\u2019t have to look far to find examples at the banks: each of NatWest, HSBC, Barclays, Lloyds and RBS have had \u201cglitches\u201d of greater or lesser impact in the past few years. BT took a big writedown on a calamitous NHS computerisation nearly a decade ago. In the private or public sector, there seems to be a record of messing up. But it\u2019s easy to get the wrong impression. We generally don\u2019t hear about all the projects that go right, because we just expect ATMs to serve us money, or tills to work, or unseen globe-spanning search engines to return results, or apps on our phones to open. TSB\u2019s customers had already been using the platform behind last week\u2019s crisis for almost everything, apart from their accounts; Sabadell, the Spanish parent of TSB, built the technology over nearly three years, building on earlier technology from Accenture. This wasn\u2019t a rush job. However, TSB\u2019s chiefs may have forgotten the longstanding rule of IT projects: completing the first 80% of it takes 80% of your time \u2013 and the last 20% takes another 80%. Managers who insist on hitting calendar targets probably aren\u2019t familiar with the endless testing that computer systems and code need. To think that the UK excels at being bad at IT projects, though, is unnecessary self-flagellation. In the US, public and private mess up too: the launch of the Healthcare.gov site in 2013 was calamitously bad, with only a tiny percentage of people able to use it at first. It improved, but there were red faces all round. In September 2014, Apple pushed out a software update for the iPhone that killed its phone capability (it was quickly reverted). And Facebook, of course, allowed the personal data of more than 80 million people to be scraped from its site. The difficulty is that software, unlike a steel beam, is hard to test for use in different environments; Nasa has managed to write error-free code, but it takes years of effort for comparatively short programs. The general level of sophistication in how software is written is \u201cin the hunter-gatherer stage\u201d, according to one professor studying it: professional code is full of bugs which have to be fixed, which often exposes other underlying bugs. The interaction between code on different systems can be unpredictable. And meanwhile managers want it done to a budget and a date. In fact, there\u2019s life in the IT project business. Capita says it will now focus on five outsourcing areas rather than 40; two of the survivors are software and IT outsourcing. Its results show that both had better profit margins than other divisions. Software is the future; and we aren\u2019t that bad at it. Powerful case for UK to get on board with onshore windfarms When the UK went without coal for three days this week, it was wind turbines that provided much of the power to keep the lights on. Contrary to what the Conservative party might have you think, people like windfarms. New government polling shows support for offshore windfarms is at a record high, with 83% of the public backing them. Even onshore windfarms, which energy minister Claire Perry said the Tories had blocked because they were \u201cjust so controversial\u201d, are now more popular than ever. For the first time, more than three-quarters of the public (76%) say they support them. Solar energy has 87% in favour. During the coal-free run, the government boasted that the UK\u2019s \u201cworld-leading renewables\u201d were going from strength to strength. Yet while there is more billpayer subsidy earmarked for offshore windfarms, there is still no support for solar and onshore wind power. Perry said she was now \u201clooking carefully\u201d at helping onshore windfarms to be built in Scotland and Wales. More offshore wind is great. The UK is reaping the rewards for its leadership there \u2013 witness GE choosing the UK to test its new 12MW turbine, the world\u2019s most powerful. But onshore windfarms are still significantly cheaper. Research has found they could be built without consumers paying any subsidy and for the same price as new gas power plants. Big firms are lining up to say they want to build more onshore wind power. Innogy, Vattenfall, SSE and ScottishPower are among the firms keen to develop windfarms in Scotland and Wales. Unlike nuclear plants, onshore windfarms can be built quickly. Public and political debates on energy are dominated by the cost of bills, of price caps. What better time to unblock the cheapest source of green power? Beast from the east isn\u2019t to blame for GDP slump \u2013 it\u2019s the frozen wages It\u2019s easy to read too much into a single set of figures, but Friday\u2019s combination of almost zero GDP growth and rising personal insolvencies presents the British government with a gloomy economic health check. Back in 2015 there were fewer than 20,000 personal insolvencies. In the first quarter of 2018 the total reached 27,388 \u2013 which was the highest quarterly figure recorded since 2012. A fall in GDP growth from 0.4% in the last three months of 2017 to 0.1% in the first three months of 2018 was even more disturbing. This first estimate of economic output showed that the UK\u2019s building industry is struggling and the manufacturing sector becalmed. The service industries continue to expand, especially banks in the Square Mile, but not at the pace seen at the height of the recovery in 2015. One-off factors may have played a part, though apparently not the \u201cbeast from the east\u201d cold snap that chancellor Philip Hammond reached for as an explanation. A more convincing explanation is the damaging effect of falling real wages over the last year. Without inflation-busting pay rises, it was little surprise that household spending, for so long the heart of the economy, would start to wane. The Treasury, meanwhile, is sitting pretty. It has refused to give government employees and welfare recipients an income increase of any significance and continued the squeeze on departmental spending, capping its costs. Yet it has benefited from the modest rise in private-sector wages, which have boosted PAYE tax receipts, while higher prices in the shops have lifted VAT receipts. As result the budget deficit at the end of March fell to its lowest level since 2007. Labour and the unions are right to complain that this situation is unsustainable. By sapping middle- and low-income households of funds, it might boost its own finances, but it undermines the long-term strength of the British economy.",

In the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/27/uk-gdp-growth-rate-slows-first-quarter\" title=\"\">first quarter of 2018 the total reached 27,388</a> \u2013 which was the highest quarterly figure recorded since 2012.</p> <p>A fall in GDP growth from 0.4% in the last three months of 2017 to 0.1% in the first three months of 2018 was even more disturbing. This first estimate of economic output showed that the UK\u2019s building industry is struggling and the manufacturing sector becalmed. The service industries continue to expand, especially banks in the Square Mile, but not at the pace seen at the height of the recovery in 2015.</p> <p>One-off factors may have played a part, though apparently not the \u201cbeast from the east\u201d cold snap that chancellor Philip Hammond reached for as an&#xa0;explanation.</p> <p>A more convincing explanation is the damaging effect of falling real wages over the last year. Without inflation-busting pay rises, it was little surprise that household spending, for so long the heart of the economy, would start to wane.</p> <p>The Treasury, meanwhile, is sitting pretty. It has refused to give government employees and welfare recipients an income increase of any significance and continued the squeeze on departmental spending, capping its costs. Yet it has benefited from the modest rise in private-sector wages, which have boosted PAYE tax receipts, while higher prices in the shops have lifted VAT receipts. As result the budget deficit at the end of March <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/24/boost-for-hammond-as-budget-deficit-hits-lowest-level-since-2007\" title=\"\">fell to its lowest level since 2007</a>.</p> <p>Labour and the unions are right to complain that this situation is unsustainable. By sapping middle- and low-income households of funds, it might boost its own finances, but it undermines the long-term strength of the British&#xa0;economy.</p>",

Trading volumes therefore dwindle and any falls in the stock market are exaggerated. The line is so old that even some of the City\u2019s ripest pros can\u2019t recall when they first started trotting it out, with one academic study even claiming it can be traced all the way back to 1694 (although presumably only the first bit, as the St Leger began in 1776). Anyway, the expression represents a throwback to the time when the gentleman stockbroker would grab the billycock and umbrella, nip out of the office for a spring luncheon, and only consider returning to work once the summer\u2019s sport had been concluded with the classic race in Doncaster, which is typically run on the second Saturday in September. All most agreeable. But the \u201csell in May\u201d line is a rare thing in the crowded field of City platitudes, in that while it is clearly self-serving (an obvious excuse for bunking off work, dressed up as investment advice) there might also be something in it for the client. First, it throws up the pleasing idea that investors can replace their broker with a calendar. And second, if stockbrokers are out of the office, the damage they can inflict on portfolios should be reduced, thereby allowing punters to enjoy their own summers. Third, unlike a lot of the City\u2019s advice, it is not guaranteed to lose you money. Granted, betting that the FTSE will fall between May and September tends to fail more often than it succeeds. While \u201csell in May\u201d supporters would argue that the winnings from the years in which the punt has come off have outpaced the losses from the summers when it went wrong over the past decade, those figures are skewed: in 2008, the stock market slumped by around 800 points. Still, there are slightly more technical-sounding reasons why \u201csell in May\u201d might sometimes work. Some reckon it relates to when dividends are paid, while others have argued it is all to do with the times of the year at which companies tend to raise money and issue shares.

But the most likely explanation for stock market moves during the summer seems to be more prosaic: that is, events. And, this year, some reckon the stars are aligned for a fall. Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at financial spread betting group City Index, says: \u201cWhile the FTSE\u2019s average returns over the past 30 years for the five-and-a-half months to St Leger day are rather uninspiring, this year could see the \u2018sell in May\u2019 adage ring true. The Bank of England is looking increasingly less likely to hike rates in May, but a rise prior to mid-September is a high probability. This, combined with increased clarity over Brexit through the summer, could see the pound rally: and given the FTSE\u2019s inverse relationship with sterling, Britain\u2019s top share index could well be in for a tough couple of months. Meanwhile, geopolitical tensions could also flare up again.\u201d All of which sounds like bad news for the City workers this summer: they may have to show up for work.",
