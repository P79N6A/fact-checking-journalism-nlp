      "bodyText": "The world\u2019s largest tobacco companies were instrumental in promoting Europe-wide, pro-business regulations that they used to delay health initiatives. Analysis carried out by the University of Bath\u2019s Tobacco Control Research Group (TCRG) has found that the companies played a key role in pushing the European commission\u2019s Better Regulation agenda, which places business interests at the heart of policy drafting. They then used the new laws to block and delay a series of major health reforms, including UK introduction of plain packaging. Under the terms of the Better Regulation agenda, which internal tobacco industry documents reveal was enthusiastically supported by British American Tobacco, European governments, including the UK, must conduct public consultations and impact assessments when introducing laws that affect business. The tobacco companies took advantage of these laws, using third parties and fake grassroots campaigns to swamp the consultations on anti-smoking initiatives such as the introduction of plain packaging. In addition, they were highly selective in what they submitted. All failed to include evidence \u2013 disclosed as a result of historic legal action \u2013 that they knew branded packaging was crucial to the marketing of their products, something they consistently denied in public. For example, a document drawn up by Marlboro manufacturer Philip Morris in 1970 explained how pack recognition research was conducted by using hidden cameras on unsuspecting consumers in stores. It states: \u201cAs a prospective customer entered the area, he broke the photoelectric beam, immediately setting in motion the concealed camera which recorded the movement of his eyes and the final selection he made. From the thousands of films, the designers and advertising men were able to determine which package, which design and what combination of colours had the most appeal.\u201d Leaked documents show that Philip Morris identified the Better Regulation laws as a key weapon in its battle to derail the 2014 EU tobacco products directive which introduced large-scale health warnings on cigarette packets and a ban on flavoured cigarettes and packs of 10 \u2013both popular marketing initiatives with young smokers. The tobacco giant employed more than 160 lobbyists and spent \u00a41.25bn opposing the directive\u2019s introduction. The European commission department responsible for drawing up the directive was swamped with 85,000 submissions.Many of the claims that they made were based on dubious evidence. According to the TCRG analysis of the submissions, \u201cthe research was of significantly lower quality than research supporting the measure. For example, the tobacco companies\u2019 arguments were not supported by any peer-reviewed journal articles about standardised packaging.\u201d Nevertheless, the tobacco giants\u2019 tactics resulted in a three-year delay in the introduction of plain packaging in the UK.Anna Gilmore, Professor of Public Health and Director of the TCRG, said their analysis highlighted the need for full transparency when it came to public consultations. \u201cThe tobacco companies played a key role in implementing Better Regulation, anticipating that it would help them delay, block or weaken public health legislation,\u201d Gilmore said. \u201cThey have now gone on to exploit it to prevent life-saving regulations.

      "bodyText": "Poor old Paul Willis. You probably don\u2019t recognise his name, but he is about to become the face of the Volkswagen scandal in Britain. Willis, the managing director of VW UK, will appear in front of the Commons transport select committee on Monday to face questions about the rigging of diesel emissions tests. Judging by the reception that Michael Horn, the US boss of VW, received from Congress last week, Willis is in for a rough ride. More than twice as many cars are affected in the UK as the US, so perhaps Willis should be prepared for twice the ferocity from the transport committee, although it is hardly as intimidating as Congress. The MPs are likely to focus on how the so-called \u201cdefeat devices\u201d ended up in VW cars and how the company intends to repair the 1.2m vehicles affected in the UK. So far VW\u2019s plan to repair the vehicles has been woefully inadequate. Motorists still have no idea how their cars will be repaired and whether they will perform at the same level afterwards. Unfortunately, the job of being country head for a multinational carmaker is a thankless task. Willis is effectively a brand ambassador, with all the key decisions \u2013 such as what cars to sell in the UK \u2013 made at VW\u2019s headquarters in Germany. This means that the transport committee could be in for a frustrating day. Time, gentlemen please The bell is ringing for last orders in the takeover battle between SABMiller and Anheuser-Busch InBev. The Takeover Panel deadline for the \u00a365bn \u201cmegabrew\u201d deal is set for Wednesday, by which time AB InBev must make a formal offer for the brewer of Grolsch and Peroni or walk away. However, SAB could invite its suitor into the bar for a lock-in if it wants to extend the deadline. If it does so, it would be a clear indication that the deal is likely to happen. So far, SAB has put up quite a fight against the serial dealmakers over at AB InBev. SAB\u2019s chairman Jan du Plessis has rebutted three informal bids and claimed that AB InBev \u201cstill very substantially undervalues SABMiller\u201d. The fact that no SAB shareholders have spoken out against the board suggests they agree with Du Plessis. But AB InBev, the maker of Budweiser, is used to getting its own way and will surely secure a deal eventually. With Altria, which owns 27% of SAB, already backing AB InBev\u2019s bid, the best SAB can hope for is ensuring that AB InBev pays a frothy price for its pint. Generosity at WH Smith? WH Smith: famous for ripping people off in hospitals, rubbish carpets in its stores \u2013 and growing profits. Despite the criticism that the stationery retailer has faced for charging higher prices in its hospital outlets and the poor state of its high-street shops \u2013 see @WHS_Carpet on Twitter for more details \u2013 WH Smith remains the great survivor of the high street. This week it is expected to report an increase in annual pre-tax profits of more than 7%, according to analysts at Investec, even though like-for-like sales on the high street will be down again. WH Smith has reported results like this for the last decade. The company has been able to increase profits by finding different ways to cut costs \u2013 such as putting its fridges on timers rather than leaving them on all day \u2013 and expanding its travel business into airports and railway stations around the world. The retailer seems to make little effort to please customers, but the savvy management team has kept the brand alive. Given this profits growth and the hundreds of millions of pounds it has returned to shareholders in recent years, surely it is time for WH Smith to give something back to shoppers by investing in lower prices and modern shops?",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The International Monetary Fund concluded its annual meeting in Lima with a warning to central bankers that the world economy risks another crash unless they continue to support growth with low interest rates. The Washington-based lender of last resort said in its final communiqu\u00e9 that uncertainty and financial market volatility have increased, and medium-term growth prospects have weakened. \u201cIn many advanced economies, the main risk remains a decline of already low growth,\u201d it said, and this needed to be supported with \u201ccontinued accommodative monetary policies, and improved financial stability\u201d. The IMF\u2019s managing director, Christine Lagarde, said there were risks of \u201cspillovers\u201d into volatile financial markets from central banks in the US and the UK increasing the cost of credit. The IMF has also urged Japan and the eurozone to maintain their plans to stimulate their ailing economies with an increase in quantitative easing. But she urged policymakers in Japan and the eurozone to boost their economies with an expansion of lending banks and businesses via extra quantitative easing. But the policy of cheap credit and the $7 trillion of quantitative easing poured into the world economy since 2009 has become increasingly controversial. A quartet of former central bank governors responded to the IMF\u2019s message with a warning to current policymakers that they risked sowing the seeds of the next financial crisis by prolonging the period of ultra-low interest. In a study launched in Lima to coincide with the IMF\u2019s annual meeting, the G30 group of experts said keeping the cost of borrowing too low for too long was leading to a dangerous buildup in debt. The study was written by four ex-central bank governors, including Jean-Claude Trichet, former president of the European Central Bank, and Axel Weber, previously president of the German Bundesbank, and now chairman of UBS. Its publication comes at a time when both the ECB and the Bank of Japan are using money creation programmes to stimulate growth, and shortly after the US Federal Reserve responded to financial market turbulence in August by delaying an increase in interest rates. The report said the emergency action taken by central banks following the collapse of the investment bank, Lehman Brothers, in September 2008 had saved the world from a second great depression, but stressed that reliance on \u201cunconventional policies might encourage excessive risk taking\u201d. It added: \u201cThe supportive actions by central banks can be useful, but there are serious risks involved if governments, parliaments, public authorities, and the private sector assume central bank policies can substitute for the structural and other policies they should take themselves. The principal risk is that excessive reliance on ever more central bank action could aggravate the underlying systemic problems and delay or prevent the necessary structural adjustments.\u201d Official interest rates have been at 0.5% in the UK since March 2009, the lowest level since the Bank of England was founded in 1694. Several European central banks have resorted to negative interest rates to fend off the threat of deflation, but Weber warned of the danger of side effects. \u201cThe crisis laid bare that the pursuit of short-term price stability alone is not a panacea. Dangerous credit-driven imbalances can accumulate even when inflation is low and stable. Credit dynamics in the future will have to be monitored much more closely, since excessive debt may result in large imbalances and distortions,\u201d Trichet said. Trichet raised interest rates after the financial crash, only to lower them again when it became obvious the recovery was far from secure. He was roundly criticised at the time and IMF officials warned last week of the dangers for global market stability should a central bank be forced to cut rates after prematurely raising them. He added: \u201cThe ultimate resolution of the crisis must be handled by governments, parliaments, public authorities as well as the private sector that should take advantage of the temporal opportunity offered by this extraordinary period of central bank policy.\u201d The report \u2013 \u201cFundamentals of central banking; the lessons of the crisis\u201d \u2013 was co-written by Weber; Trichet; Jacob Frenkel, former governor of the Bank of Israel; and Arminio Fraga, former governor of the Bank of Brazil. Frenkel said structural reforms were needed to boost economies\u2019 growth potential. \u201cIn the absence of such needed reforms, the unintended consequences of a prolonged period of extraordinarily loose policy are accumulating,\u201d he added.",

They want to buy American products.\u201d On Wednesday Clinton, the frontrunner for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016, echoed concern on the left of the party when she came out against the deal in an interview with PBS, saying: \u201cAs of today, I am not in favor of what I have learned about it.\u201d On Saturday, Obama continued: \u201cThey want our cars, our music, our food. And if American businesses can sell more of their products in those markets, they can expand and support good jobs here at home.\u201d The president said US exports supported about 12 million jobs \u201cthat typically pay better than other jobs\u201d. \u201cBut here\u2019s the thing,\u201d he added. \u201cOutdated trade rules put our workers at a disadvantage. And TPP will change that.\u201d On Monday, the US and 11 other countries announced agreement on the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the biggest trade deal in a generation. In his five-minute address on the subject, Obama focused mostly on the taxes on US-made products that the deal will eliminate, saying that will level the playing field for American businesses and workers. \u201cOur businesses will get a fair deal,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd those who oppose passing this new trade deal are really just accepting a status quo that everyone knows puts us at a disadvantage.\u201d TPP has been years in the making, but it has come under fire from allies and enemies of the president alike. The Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren, a key voice on economic policies from the left, and Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, running second in presidential polls, have long opposed the deal. In a statement after Clinton\u2019s PBS interview, the Sanders campaign said the senator was \u201cglad that Secretary Clinton has now come on board\u201d. Sanders continues to echo concerns among US labor unions that the deal will cost \u201cmillions of decent-paying jobs\u201d. While serving as secretary of state under Obama, Clinton spoke in favor of the TPP, saying at one point that it \u201csets the gold standard in trade agreements to open free, transparent, fair trade, the kind of environment that has the rule of law and a level playing field\u201d. In a statement issued after her PBS interview, Clinton said: \u201cI still believe in the goal of a strong and fair trade agreement in the pacific as part of a broader strategy both at home and abroad, just as I did when I was secretary of state. \u201cI appreciate the hard work that President Obama and his team put into this process and recognize the strides they made. But the bar here is very high and, based on what I have seen, I don\u2019t believe this agreement has met it.\u201d One of the main criticisms of TPP is that it has been shrouded in secrecy. So far the only parts of the deal the public has been able to read and review have been those that have been leaked. This week, Wikileaks released what it claimed to be the full intellectual property chapter of the TPP. On Saturday, Obama dismissed criticism regarding such apparent secrecy. \u201cIn the coming weeks and months, you\u2019ll be able to read every word of this agreement online well before I sign it,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ll be able to see for yourself how this agreement is better than past trade deals \u2013 and how it\u2019s better for America\u2019s working families.\u201d",
