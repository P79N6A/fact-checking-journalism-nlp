      "bodyText": "Barclays was subjected to more regulatory attention than any other UK high street bank in 2014, receiving 186 visits from the Financial Conduct Authority\u2019s officials. The high level of regulatory scrutiny on the bank was revealed by a freedom of information request. It shows Barclays received more than twice as many visits as HSBC, which was called on by FCA staff 85 times during the year. The data, obtained by Bloomberg, was published following the resignation of Martin Wheatley, the regulator\u2019s boss, last week after he was told his five-year contract was not going to be renewed. Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group, both bailed out by the taxpayer in the wake of the banking crisis, received 65 and 58 visits respectively. The number of visits are determined by the business mix of each bank. Barclays, for instance, not only has a high street bank and investment banking arm but also a major presence in credit cards through its Barclaycard operations. All the banks have received fines from the FCA in recent years, although Barclays has been the focus of public attention since the \u00a3290m fine for rigging Libor in 2012. Barclays is now being run by John McFarlane, who is taking an executive role after Antony Jenkins was pushed out as chief executive earlier this month. There is speculation that he wants to accelerate efforts to cut costs, which could lead to more job losses on top of the 19,000 announced last year. The bank is also gradually phasing out the Woolwich brand it has used for its mortgage products since it bought the former building society 15 years ago.",

      "bodyText": "The general election was only10 weeks ago and already the big banks have scored two major lobbying triumphs. In round one, chancellor George Osborne revamped the bank levy in a way that will save HSBC about \u00a3700m a year. Then Martin Wheatley, the get-tough regulator at the Financial Conduct Authority who set a record for fining banks, was ditched last week. Whatever next? Could the banking ringfence, the centrepiece of the post-crisis regulatory reforms, be at risk? In theory, the answer should be a definite no. The legislation requiring banks to erect ringfences around their UK retail divisions by January 2019 was approved by parliament in 2013. The Conservative party\u2019s election manifesto reaffirmed a commitment to finish the job \u201cto protect hardworking taxpayers from future banking crashes\u201d. The Bank of England\u2019s Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) is yet to determine the precise details of the ringfence but the big issues are meant to be settled. \u201cThe PRA does not consider that the responses to the consultation necessitate major changes to its proposed approach to implementing ringfencing,\u201d said an update in May. Yet the bellyaching from some banks grows louder. The current and former chairmen of Barclays have argued for a rethink on ringfencing, pleading that it will be costly and is no longer necessary. HSBC cited the reform as a reason why it might move its head office out of the UK. The bankers, it appears, also think they are making progress with their self-interested argument that a chancellor interested in growth should be less tough on structural reform. The Sunday papers are full of stories that the Treasury is considering softening the ringfence. Osborne, let\u2019s hope, will put a stop to this silliness. If he casts his mind back just a few years, he will recall that he backed ringfencing enthusiastically for two reasons that remain as relevant today as then. The first aim of the ringfencing legislation is it to make it easier to wind down failed banks and save the parts worth saving \u2013 \u201cexactly what could not be done in 2008 when Royal Bank of Scotland failed\u201d, as Martin Taylor, a member of the Bank of England\u2019s financial policy committee, said in a recent speech. The second related ambition was to isolate retail banks\u2019 balance sheets and stop the implicit subsidy from taxpayers to other parts of a broad banking group. That change, no doubt, could be expensive for a bank like Barclays \u2013 its investment bank, in effect, would have to stand on its own feet and find its own sources of capital, which might be pricier. But so what? It is not the job of UK taxpayers to help ensure that Barclays\u2019 investment bank can compete with its Wall Street rivals. Osborne should also remember that ringfencing was not a mindless piece of bank-bashing adopted on a whim. The reforms were proposed after lengthy debate and evidence-gathering by the Vickers Commission in 2010-11. They were deemed vital protections for a country like the UK with an oversized banking sector. Reform might also ensure that recovery after the next banking crisis is quicker \u2013 a case of fixing the roof while the sun is shining, as the chancellor might put it. As it happens, Osborne is appearing in front of the Treasury select committee on Tuesday, albeit on other matters. It would be a good thing if committee chair Andrew Tyrie, a fan of ringfencing (in electrified form, no less), grabbed the opportunity to get an on-the-record pledge that the government remains fully committed to its flagship banking reform. Travelling light Travelodge\u2019s financial performance seems to be improving, though it\u2019s hard to conclude so definitively from a \u201cresults update\u201d that bizarrely mixed a six-month revenue number and a 12-month profit number. The company is privately-owned, and thus under no obligation to prepare audited half-year figures, but management is still allowed to use common sense. Travelodge\u2019s owners \u2013 Goldman Sachs and a pair of US hedge funds \u2013 are looking to flog the business and may succeed in getting the rumoured \u00a31bn. The strategic masterstroke behind the claimed recovery was the decision to install beds that keep fewer customers awake. That task proved impossible to fund before a debt restructuring in 2012. But the hangover from the debt misadventure, the work of former owner Dubai International Capital, can still be detected. In a normal world, one might expect Travelodge and arch-rival Premier Inn, owned by Whitbread, to achieve roughly similar revenues per available room, the industry\u2019s key yardstick. But even an improving Travelodge\u2019s \u00a335.87 is low against Premier Inn\u2019s latest reading, \u00a349.13. An optimistic spin might say Travelodge has plenty of potential to improve. If so, why are Goldman and the hedgies so keen to check out? They \u201care not natural long-term holders of a hotel business\u201d explains Peter Gowers, Travelodge chief executive. Maybe. Or perhaps the owners think peak valuations for hotels lie around the next economic corner.",

    "webTitle": "Gold falls to five-year low as fears ease over Greece", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Gold has fallen to its lowest price for more than five years, as the precious metal was buffeted by the deal to avert a Greek bankruptcy, a potential US interest rate increase and a sharp sell-off in China. Gold encountered a wave of selling in Asia that drove it down almost 4% to as low as $1,088 (\u00a3699) an ounce on Monday before recovering slightly to $1,114. The last time gold traded at that level was in March 2010. The fall was prompted by heavy trading in China, the world\u2019s biggest consumer of gold. Traditionally gold has served as a safe haven for investors during periods of uncertainty but investors often to move money into other assets once calm returns to stock and bond markets. Ten years ago gold was worth around $500 an ounce only to soar above $1,800 in the aftermath of the first Greek crisis in 2011 before falling back. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at stockbroker Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \u201cThe yellow metal is traditionally seen as a store of value and a protection policy against catastrophe, both attractive features in recent years given the depth of the financial crisis and the devaluation of fiat currencies by central bankers cranking the printing presses. However, those worries have receded and with them so has the gold price.\u201d The latest fall was prompted by trading in China,which on Friday said that its gold reserves had increased by 57% from the last time it adjusted its figures six years ago. Analysts at Barclays said gold might have fallen following the announcement because investors realised China would not increase reserves that much again, cutting off a strong source of demand. The drop was exacerbated by the triggering of stop-loss orders, which are trades arranged to limit a trader\u2019s loss on an investment as the price falls. The Chinese sell-off added to the easing of market turmoil over Greece that helped send the price of gold down each day last week. Greek banks have started to reopen and Greece is expected to use a bridging loan from the EU, agreed last week, to make a \u20ac4.2bn (\u00a32.9bn) repayment to the European Central Bank. The Barclays analysts said: \u201cGold continued its price deterioration last week, as relative calm returned to the global markets. We believe that gold should trade around current levels, but do not dismiss the possibility of further price declines, given the lack of safe haven interest.\u201d Like several other analysts, they said gold could weaken further in the third quarter of the year as the prospect looms of an interest rate increase in the US, probably in September. Most metals have fallen in value over recent months following a slowdown in global demand, especially in China. Copper, which is a staple of most industrial processes, has fallen to its 2008 level and gold\u2019s fall also pulled down the price palladium and platinum. Randgold, the gold producer, was the second-biggest faller in the FTSE 100 index amid a general sell-off of mining companies. The sell-off may also have been exacerbated by the remarks from Janet Yellen, the US Federal Reserve chair, who told Congress last week that the Fed was on track to increase rates if the economy continued to grow. Gold usually falls when the US dollar rises because investors sell some gold to buy the currency. The dollar rose to near a three-week high of 124.15 yen. Khalaf said: \u201cGiven the direction central bank policy in the US appears to be going, expectations of a rate rise could also be weighing down on gold.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Greek debt crisis: Greece begins repaying ECB and IMF as banks reopen - as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Our main story tonight: Greece has taken a step back to normality after its banks reopened following three weeks of closures and receipt of a \u20ac7.2bn (\u00a35bn) loan, with almost all of it spent on repaying debts. After a quieter day by recent eurozone standards, a closing summary before we go: Bank branches across Greece have reopened today, as the financial restrictions that have constrained the country for the last three weeks are relaxed, a little, following last week\u2019s bailout deal. Queues formed early at branches in Athens and Thessaloniki, but there were no reports of panic. In Athens, our correspondent Helena Smith reports that bank officials were, in fact, surprised at how quiet it was. The banking sector is still subject to capital controls, which mean people can\u2019t withdraw more than \u20ac420 per week from their accounts, or transfer money overseas. Here\u2019s a list of the restrictions. Greek shareholders aren\u2019t allowed to buy or sell stock today, as the Athens exchange remains closed. It may open later this week. The European Commission sent a $7.2bn bridge loan to Greece today; the money was used to repay a maturing debt repayment owed to the ECB, and to cover outstanding bills to the IMF. The IMF confirmed Greece has now cleared its arrears with the fund. Last week\u2019s austerity measures are already hitting Greeks, who are now paying higher VAT rates on many basic goods. The IMF has announced that Maurice Obstfeld, an expert on optimal currency unions, will take over from retiring chief economist Olivier Blanchard. On financial markets, European share indices have risen as Greek worries recede, yields on Italian, Portuguese and Spanish government bonds have fallen and safe-haven favourite gold has sold off sharply. Thanks for reading and all the comments. We will be back in the morning with the latest economic and business news from the UK, the eurozone and beyond. On a day when the Greek banks opened their doors for the first time inthree weeks, the debate about future funding needs seems far away.But our economics correspondent Phillip Inman asks what lies ahead for Greece\u2019s battered financial sector. He writes: Plenty of dangers lie in wait for Greek banks. Already short of cash, they may need lots more when stress tests of their solvency are carried out in a month or two. And unable to access the international money markets, they will be in a similar position to the Greek god Telephus, who was wounded by Achilles and yet needed Achilles to return as a doctor before he could be healed. The Greek banks, stripped of many of their assets by the European Central Bank, will need the ECB to make a re-appearance in Athens to aid their recovery... A couple of months from now, the story could take a grim turn. Not only will hundreds of millions of deposits have been withdrawn in that time, the weakening effects of a broader economic slowdown will have taken their toll. The full analysis from Phillip: European stock markets have closed higher as worries about Greece recede. The main share indices have not managed to hold on to all their early gains but are still well within positive territory. The Italian FTSE MIB has lead the way, up more than 1.1%: On government bond markets, the ebbing away of Grexit fears has also helped bring down yields in Southern Europe. Yields on Portuguese, Spanish and Italian 10-year government bonds are all lower. Of course, the big move on financial markets today, as reported earlier, has been in the old safe-haven favourite: gold. The gold price fell to its lowest for more than five years as the precious metal was buffeted by the deal to avert a Greek bankruptcy, a potential US interest rate increase and a sharp sell-off in China. It has since rebounded from a low of $1,088.05. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown comments: Gold has struggled against a backdrop of global economic recovery and a strengthening dollar, and the recent sell-off appears to have come on the back of the Chinese central bank reporting its gold holdings, which disappointed analyst\u2019s expectations. The yellow metal is traditionally seen as a store of value and a protection policy against catastrophe, both attractive features in recent years given the depth of the financial crisis and the devaluation of fiat currencies by central bankers cranking the printing presses. However those worries have receded, and with them so has the gold price.\u201d Here is our news story on today\u2019s sharp moves for gold: Helena Smith has also been in the vaults of the Bank of Greece talking to Ioannis Zafeiropoulos, who has oversight of some 7,500 safety deposit boxes \u2013 held behind iron bars and huge steel doors. She reports: An official at the bank for the past 31 years,Zafeiropoulos had spent 10 days drawing up a contingency plan. His worry: that once the banks reopened, the vaults might be stormed by savers fearing the country\u2019s enforced ejection from the euro zone. \u201cHow was I going to cope when no more than four people can be in a vault at the same time?\u201d he asked. \u201cI had to devise a plan but instead of 3,000 people turning up as I had thought we\u2019ve had less than a hundred. We\u2019ve been joking about how disappointing it\u2019s been.\u201d All morning, he said, he had been asking himself why. \u201cPeople have behaved so responsibly, so maturely today,\u201d said Zafeiropoulos. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s because they have probably said \u2018now that the banks have opened, they are not going to close again and what on earth will I do with the contents of a safety box? Where will I hide my money or my jewels if I do take them out?\u2019\u201d he murmured. \u201cThis crisis is never going to end. Do the sums, see how much they say we owe them,\u201d he said referring to the EU, ECB and IMF that have kept the country afloat \u201cand you\u2019ll understand it will not be ending anytime soon.\u201d The reopening of Greek banks may have been highly symbolic for the crisis-hit country\u2019s economy but in many ways today has defied expectations. Our correspondent Helena Smith reports from Athens. The opening of Greek banks on Monday was not without symbolism. After 21 days of being firmly closed, the sight of their shutters going up was uplifting both for Greeks and their debt-stricken economy - an economy that with the added restriction of capital controls has suffered immeasurable damage in the meantime. \u201cWhat economy can work without its banks?\u201d asked Spyros Kouroumbiotis, a pensioner in the queue at the Bank of Greece waiting to pay his taxes. \u201cAs an economist I still help family with their business and I can tell you it\u2019s been a huge ordeal. Exports have stopped, imports have stopped, nothing has worked because it\u2019s been impossible to pay anyone.\u201d But on Monday it was the manner of their re-opening that surprised officials most. Quite quickly it became evident that the panic-stricken deluge of branches many had feared was simply not happening. Greeks, who have spent the best part of five years internalising the crisis \u2013 of getting used to bad news \u2013 had reacted with their feet: they had stayed home. And those who hadn\u2019t were willing to stand in neat orderly queues, motivated to large degree by the desire to keep up with annual taxes and utility bills. More from Helena later Sticking with the IMF, the fund has just announced the successor to retiring chief economist Olivier Blanchard. Professor Maurice Obstfeld takes over the role of economic counsellor and director of the IMF\u2019s research department in September, IMF managing director Christine Lagarde announces. Describing Blanchard\u2019s successor, the IMF says: \u201cA Professor of Economics (and former Chair of the Department of Economics) at the University of California, Berkeley, Obstfeld has advised many governments and consulted at central banks all over the world. He is currently serving as a member of President Obama\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers, on leave from Berkeley.\u201d Obstfeld is the co-author of two textbooks on international economics\u2014Foundations of International Macroeconomics with former IMF Economic Counsellor Kenneth Rogoff, and International Economics with Paul Krugman and Marc Melitz. Lagarde comments in a statement: \u201cI am thrilled to have Maurice join us at the Fund. His outstanding academic credentials and extensive international experience make him exceptionally well placed to provide intellectual leadership to the IMF at this important juncture. He is known around the globe for his work on international economics and is considered one of the most influential macroeconomists in the world.\u201d \u201cThe position of Economic Counsellor is of fundamental importance to the IMF\u2019s ability to provide its global membership with the best possible independent analysis and policy advice. I am confident that we have found an exceptional candidate in Maurice to take this work forward.\u201d Ferdinando Giugliano at the Financial Times notes that Obstfeld is an expert on optimal currency areas. The eurozone will give him plenty to get his teeth into You can read more about Obstfeld on his homepage, where there are links to his recent papers, including on the eurozone, like this one on \u201csome lessons of the euro crisis\u201d. Further to that statement from the IMF on Greece no longer being in arrears to the Fund, as a refresher when the country missed a \u20ac1.6bn payment on 30 June it became the first developed country to default to the IMF. It joined a club that includes Zimbabwe, Somalia and Sudan, which have all fallen into arrears with the fund. Until that point no missed payment had been more than \u00a3890m (\u20ac1.3bn). So Greece\u2019s missed payment of \u20ac1.6bn was bigger than any previous case of arrears. But it was short-lived and Greek officials had already said earlier today that a \u20ac2.05bn payment to the Washington-based fund was underway, representing two missed payments \u2013 that \u20ac1.6bn and another smaller one that followed in July. As just reported, the IMF says the money has now been paid back. Now Greece has cleared its arrears at the IMF, it is entitled to more loans from the fund. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has just issued a brief statement confirming Greece has repaid its arrears to the fund, as had been expected after Greece got a bridging loan to cover its most pressing debts. Gerry Rice, the IMF\u2019s director of communications says: \u201cI can confirm that Greece today repaid the totality of its arrears to the IMF, equivalent to SDR 1.6 billion (about \u20ac2.0bn). Greece is therefore no longer in arrears to the IMF. \u201cAs we have said, the Fund stands ready to continue assisting Greece in its efforts to return to financial stability and growth.\u201d Back to the main events in the eurozone now and our reporter in Brussels, Jennifer Rankin, has been looking at Greece\u2019s \u2018now you see it, now you don\u2019t\u2019 bridging loan. She reports: The Greek money merry-go-round carries on in full swing as Athens received a \u20ac7.2bn (\u00a35bn) loan from the EU and immediately spent almost all of it on repaying debts. Greek officials confirmed on Monday they had begun paying back international lenders, not long after the emergency bridging loan arrived in the Greek government\u2019s bank account. The EU agreed the loan on Friday to enable Athens to meet urgent debt repayments and clear arrears, both necessary hurdles if the Greek government is to get a three-year bailout worth up to \u20ac86bn. Greece\u2019s bank branches are open for the first time in three weeks, but capital controls still stop people from withdrawing more than \u20ac420/week. The full story: Jennifer also shares a possible hint of missing all those eurogroup meetings. Be careful what you wish for.... Regular readers of this blog will have become very familiar with the Financial Times\u2019 excellent reporters in the field who have covered the Greek crisis tirelessly in recent months. News is just breaking that their pink paper could be moving to new owners. Bloomberg reports that owner of the FT, UK-listed Pearson, is \u201cexploring a sale of the Financial Times after receiving interest from potential buyers, according to people familiar with the matter.\u201d Bloomberg says Pearson is sounding out possible bidders and a sale may value the business at as much as \u00a31bn. The full Bloomberg story is here. Meanwhile the FT\u2019s Brussels bureau chief Peter Spiegel has this take on report. That \u00a31bn price in the Bloomberg story, incidentally, is the same the number speculated on by analysts back in 2012 when talk swirled of a FT sale by Pearson. Turning to the UK briefly, the wave of rate hike remarks from Bank of England policymakers last week, have kept the pound strong today. After BoE governor Mark Carney signalled that the first rise in interest rates since the global financial crash could take place around the turn of the year, traders have been re-positioning themselves to price in the chances of a hike before 2016. That is good news for British holidaymakers jetting off abroad, whose pounds will now stretch further. It is not so welcome, however, for UK exporters given they had already been reporting pressure from a strong pound, given it makes UK goods more expensive to overseas buyers. Today the pound is weaker against the euro but at \u20ac1.4338 still not far off a seven-and-a-half year high hit on Friday. Against a trade-weighted basket used by the BoE, the pound is also near last week\u2019s seven-and-a-half year high. A quick recap. Bank branches across Greece have reopened today, as the financial restrictions that have constrained the country for the last three weeks are relaxed, a little, following last week\u2019s bailout deal. Queues formed early at branches in Athens and Thessaloniki, but there were no reports of panic. That\u2019s partly because the banking sector is still subject to capital controls, which mean people can\u2019t withdraw more than \u20ac420 per week from their accounts, or transfer money overseas. Here\u2019s a list of the restrictions. Greek shareholders aren\u2019t allowed to buy or sell stock today, as the Athens exchange remains closed. It may open later this week. The European Commission is sending a $7.2bn bridge loan to Greece today; the money is being used to repay a maturing debt repayment owed to the ECB, and to cover outstanding bills to the IMF. Last week\u2019s austerity measures are already hitting Greeks, who are now paying higher VAT rates on many basic goods. European stock markets have risen this morning, with the main indices up around 1% in a fairly quiet trading session. Greek fears have receded, for the moment at least. Greece\u2019s finance minister, Euclid Tsakalotos, has said farewell to one deputy this lunchtime, and welcomed another. Nadia Valavani (the outgoing deputy fin. min.) resigned last week in protest at Greece\u2019s new bailout programme, and is being replaced by Tryfon Alexiadis: Alexiadis had better hit the ground running, as the Greek government must pass a second set of austerity measures later this week (probably on Wednesday night). Here\u2019s a technical explanation of how Greece\u2019s new bridge loan will work (thanks to Katy Lee of AFP) The EC\u2019s chief spokesman, Margaritis Schinas, is fielding a few questions on Greece: Greece won\u2019t have much time to enjoy the \u20ac7bn bridge loan organised by the European Union last week. EU officials have just announced that this financing has been sent to Athens today, following several days of work by Brussels officials. But over in the Greek capital, the money is already being spent to address Greece\u2019s latest debt demands. Government officials have confirmed that the process of repaying $4.2bn to the European Central Bank today has begun. That means Greece will avoid defaulting on its obligations to the ECB, which would have had very serious consequences. Greece also plans to clear its arrears to the International Monetary Fund, by sending \u20ac2.05bn over to Washington. That will cover the \u20ac1.6bn repayments due in June, which was missed as Greece staggered out of its previous bailout, plus a second payment due last week. So in short, Greece\u2019s creditors have loaned it more money, so it can repay its creditors. The cash spends hardly any time in Athens at all, before being yanked back out again. Maybe it should be renamed a bungee loan..... But while shares rally, the price of gold has hit its lowest level since early 2010: Europe\u2019s stock markets are all up this morning, as worries over Greece recede. The Italian FTSE MIB is leading the way, up 1.5%, followed by Spain, France and Germany: City experts appreciate that the Greek crisis isn\u2019t over. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at SpreadEx, explains: After a weekend (mercifully) free of big Eurozone drama, the semblance of normality returned this morning as the Greek banks opened for the first time in 3 weeks. But there is a reason why these re-openings merely provide a surface level simulation of a working economy, not the real thing; capital controls remain in place, with the Greek public allowed only \u20ac420 a week (a marginal adjustment of the previous \u20ac60 a day) alongside a host of other restrictions. But rather than watching Athens and Brussels again, many traders are concentrating on events up at St Andrews: Greece\u2019s factories was struggling even before capital controls were imposed at the end of June, new data shows. Turnover across the industrial sector shrank by 4.2% year-on year in May, according to stats body Elstat. That follows a 4% annual decline in April, and a very serious slide at the start of the year: Elstat reports that mining and quarrying turnover slumped by 8.3%, while manufacturing turnover dropped by 4.2%. Quote of the Day goes to Paul Krugman, the Nobel Prize-winning economist. He\u2019s admitted to CNN\u2019s Fareed Zakaria that he didn\u2019t anticipate that Alexis Tsipras wouldn\u2019t have a Plan B, in case Greece\u2019s creditors didn\u2019t fold. Krugman on assuming that Greece had an exit plan from the Euro: \u201c\u2026it didn\u2019t even occur to me that they would be prepared to make a stand without having done any contingency planning ...amazingly - they thought they could simply demand better terms without having any backup plan. So certainly this is a shock. But, you know, in some sense, it\u2019s hopeless in any case. \u2026it\u2019s not as if the terms that they were being offered before were feasible. I mean, the new terms are even worse, but the terms they were being offered before were still not going to work. So I, you know, I may have overestimated the competence of the Greek government.\u201d Krugman also believes that Greece will eventually leave the eurozone, unless it is granted \u201cenormous\u201d debt relief. The re-opening of Greece\u2019s banks appears to be operating smoothly, judging by this photo from a National Bank branch in Athens: Today\u2019s Greek VAT rise is the third since the country\u2019s austerity programme began, five years ago: Greek consumers are facing higher prices today, as the sales tax hike demanded by its creditors is applied. Sweeping VAT changes mean some food stuffs, restaurant meals and education services cost more. And even death (life\u2019s other certainty alongside those taxes) will be more expensive: Associated Press has the details: The VAT rose from 13% to 23%, making some meats, cooking oils other than olive oil, cocoa, vinegar, salt, flowers, firewood, fertilizer, insecticides, sanitary towels and other basics all more expensive. Services hit by the new VAT increases include restaurants and cafes, funeral parlors, taxis, cramming and tutorial schools very popular with Greek students seeking to make up for the deficiencies of the school system language institutes and computer learning centers. Public transport fares are expected to rise early next month. Bloomberg is reporting that Greece has spent almost all of the \u20ac7bn bridge loan hammered out by the eurozone on Friday. If so, Greece would have met today\u2019s repayment to the European Central Bank, and covered its arrears to the International Monetary Fund (having missed two payments in recent weeks) More to follow.... Customers at this National Bank branch in Athens received little numbered tickets to allocate places in the queue: But heated conversations with the branch manager were on a strictly \u2018first-come, first-served\u2019 basis..... Across central Athens, customers waited patiently at this Alpha Bank branch: Although Greece\u2019s banks are reopening, customers will find that many services are still off limits. Macropolis, the news and analysis site, has compiled a list of the current restrictions, on top of the \u20ac420/week limit on cash withdrawals. Here\u2019s some highlights: Cashing-in of checks or payments via letters of guarantees are allowed only if the money is credited in a bank account. Withdrawals from credit or prepaid cards in Greece or abroad are forbidden. Money transfers abroad are forbidden including use of credit, prepaid or debit cards for cross country payments. The use of credit or debit cards abroad is allowed only for goods or services purchases without cash and up to the limit set by each bank. New sight or savings accounts cannot be opened, while dormant accounts cannot be reactivated. Early, partial or full loan repayment is forbidden except repayment via cash or money transfer from abroad. Early, partial or full termination of a time deposit is forbidden unless the amount of the early partial termination is used for payment of tax, social security or bank loan obligations, payroll payment within the same bank, payment of hospital or educational expenses. After months of drama, the financial markets are now more relaxed about Greece, according to David Cumming, head of UK equities at Standard Life Investments. He told Radio 4\u2019s Today Programme that: \u201cThe key question is: is the euro going to break up because of the Greek crisis, and the answer is no it isn\u2019t. The second issue is when are we going to stop talking about it because it\u2019s corrosive at the margin for business confidence in Europe. The answer is relatively soon. From a market perspective it [Greece] has become less of an issue\u201d. (via the BBC) Queues also formed outside National Bank branches in Athens, but it all looks calm: Customers queued outside this National Bank branch in Thessaloniki, Greece\u2019s second city, this morning, as it reopened for the first time since late June: The head of Greece\u2019s banking association, Louka Katseli, hopes that Greeks will put money back into their accounts: She told Skai television yesterday: \u201cTomorrow when the banks reopen and normality is restored, let\u2019s all help our economy. If we take our money out of chests and from our homes - where they are not safe in any case - and we deposit them in the banks, we will strengthen the liquidity of the economy,\u201d (quote via Reuters). Adea Guillot, journalist with Le Monde, is tweeting from a bank branch in Athens: Traders on the Greek stock market must be itching to get back to work after their three week delay. But they\u2019ll have to be patient. The Athens exchange will remain closed today, even though Greece\u2019s banks are opening up to customers right now. According to spokeswoman Alexandra Grispou, the new capital controls degree issued on Saturday \u201cdoesn\u2019t allow us to open today.\u201d The exchange could open in a couple of days, according to Evangelos Charatsis, managing director of Beta Securities, a financial services firm. He told Bloomberg TV that some staff took holidays once capital controls were imposed three weeks ago, adding: Others worked part time, then went to the beach. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the Greek debt crisis. Across Greece, banks are reopening after a three-week hiatus. Customers are flocking to their local branches for the first time since Alexis Tsipras\u2019s fateful decision to call a referendum on the country\u2019s bailout terms. But the situation remains far from normal, with capital controls still in place. Customers are only allowed to take out \u20ac420 per week (a slight tweak to the \u20ac60 per day limit). But as Associated Press explains, that\u2019s only the start.... Bank customers will still not be able to cash checks, only deposit them into their accounts, and will not be able to get cash abroad with their credit or cash cards, only make purchases. There are also restrictions on opening new accounts or activating dormant ones. Here\u2019s our latest news story explaining the situation: Today had (until recently) been inked in as the moment when Greece\u2019s battle against bankruptcy floundered. It is is due to make a $3.5bn bond repayment to the ECB today (plus $700m in interest), which would have been impossible before last week\u2019s bailout deal. Instead, the $7bn bridge loan agreed last week should arrive just in time to repay Greece\u2019s creditors. As Bloomberg explains: Greece has reached the deadline it couldn\u2019t afford to miss, for a bill it can finally afford to pay. Greece\u2019s Real Crisis Deadline Arrives With ECB Debt to Pay But this crisis isn\u2019t over. Negotiations over Greece\u2019s bailout are going to take several weeks, perhaps a month. And Alexis Tsipras\u2019s position remains precarious. Last Friday\u2019s night\u2019s reshuffle has sidelined several key dissenters, breaking the PM\u2019s links to the far-left faction of Syriza and making an autumn election more likely. We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day....",

Exports have stopped, imports have stopped, nothing has worked because it\u2019s been impossible to pay anyone.\u201d</p> <p>But on Monday it was the manner of their re-opening that surprised officials most. Quite quickly it became evident that the panic-stricken deluge of branches many had feared was simply not happening. Greeks, who have spent the best part of five years internalising the crisis \u2013 of getting used to bad news \u2013 had reacted with their feet: they had stayed home. And those who hadn\u2019t were willing to stand in neat orderly queues, motivated to large degree by the desire to keep up with annual taxes and utility bills. </p> </blockquote> <p><em>More from Helena later</em><br></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2015-07-20T15:34:36.168Z\">at 4.34pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-55ad08cae4b0571ff3515c43\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-07-20T14:54:19.373Z\">3.54pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Sticking with the IMF, the fund has just <a href=\"http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/pr/2015/pr15343.htm\">announced</a> the <strong>successor to retiring chief economist Olivier Blanchard</strong>.

      "bodyText": "Greece has taken a step back to normality after its banks reopened following three weeks of closures and receipt of a \u20ac7.2bn (\u00a35bn) loan, with almost all of it spent on repaying debts. Greek officials began paying back international lenders shortly after the emergency bridging loan arrived in the Greek government\u2019s bank account on Monday. The EU agreed the loan on Friday to enable Athens to meet urgent debt repayments and clear arrears, both necessary hurdles if the Greek government is to get a three-year bailout worth up to \u20ac86bn. The money was transferred to Athens around noon (1000 BST) and was immediately used to repay Greece\u2019s international creditors. The Greek government has begun making a \u20ac4.2bn payment to the European Central Bank, officials told Reuters \u2013 a \u20ac3.5bn loan plus \u20ac0.7bn interest. Failure to make this payment could have forced Greece out of the eurozone, as the ECB would have had to pull its support for Greek banks because it cannot back an insolvent country. The Greek government also owes \u20ac500,000 to the central bank of Greece and must clear this debt so it is not indebted to the \u201ceurosystem\u201d \u2013 the central banks of the eurozone. The International Monetary Fund confirmed it had received around \u20ac2bn from Greece, representing two missed payments. Greece became the first developed economy to default on an IMF loan when it missed a payment nearly three weeks ago, putting it in the company of Somalia, Sudan and Zimbabwe. After 20 days, Greece is now out of that group, as a spokesman confirmed it was no longer in arrears. \u201cThe fund stands ready to continue assisting Greece in its efforts to return to financial stability and growth,\u201d he added. Greek government officials are hoping the economy will get back to normal as the nation\u2019s banks reopened, although capital controls remain in place. Queues formed outside bank branches, with Greeks now able to withdraw up to \u20ac420 a week in one go, rather than being limited to \u20ac60 a day. But restrictions on sending money abroad and other controls have not been lifted. The Athens stock market is closed until further notice. \u201cCapital controls and restrictions on withdrawals will remain in place, but we are entering a new stage which we all hope will be one of normality,\u201d Louka Katseli, head of the Greek banking association, said. The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, told German radio at the weekend that the remaining capital controls were \u201cnot normal life\u201d and showed the need for speedy negotiations on a proposed \u20ac86bn bailout for Greece. The eurozone is pinning its hopes on reaching a deal with Athens by mid-August, which would allow Greece to pay \u20ac5bn of debt due that month using its new bailout fund rather than another emergency bridging loan. Officials from Greece\u2019s creditors known as the troika \u2013 the European commission, the ECB and the IMF \u2013 are expected to travel to Athens later this week to begin negotiations on a memorandum of understanding, the basic text of the bailout agreement. Their return to the Greek capital will underscore how Greece\u2019s prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, has failed to significantly change the terms of the bailout deal. But the Greek government still has several hurdles to clear before talks can officially get under way. By Wednesday, the Greek parliament must pass a law to overhaul its civil justice system, with the aim of speeding up processes and reducing costs. The government must also transpose the EU\u2019s bank recovery and resolution directive into law. This law was part of Europe\u2019s response to the 2008 banking crisis and should have been put into national law months ago. The Greek parliament has already rushed through changes to its VAT system, another condition of securing the bailout. As of Monday, VAT on food and public transport is now 23%, up from 13%.",

    "webTitle": "Ben Sherman sold to Marquee Brands", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Ben Sherman, the struggling British clothing brand sported by successive generations of rock stars from the Who and the Jam to Oasis, is hoping to make a comeback after being snapped up by a private equity-backed firm. Marquee Brands, controlled by the US investment group Neuberger Berman, is buying the loss-making business for \u00a341m from its current owner, Oxford Industries, also based in the US. It is the latest change in ownership for Ben Sherman, a company whose shirts were a staple of the golden age of UK youth cults, worn by mods in the 60s and later adopted by that movement\u2019s various offshoots including skinheads, suedeheads and rude boys. But the business \u2013 founded in Brighton in 1963 by Arthur Benjamin Sugarman and sold by him in the 1970s \u2013 has lost its way in recent years. Sugarman moved from Britain to the US at the end of the second world war, raised a family and worked at his father-in-law\u2019s clothing manufacturing business. Having changed his name to the more all-American sounding Ben Sherman, he returned with his family to England in the early 60s and rented a factory in Brighton, Sussex. He spotted that high-spending members of the growing mod movement were buying imported preppy button-down shirts made by firms in the US such as Brooks Brothers and decided to produce his own version. Sherman imported fabrics from the US and packaged each of his shirts, made from Oxford cotton in unusual colours such as pink and mint green, in a box. The shirts\u2019 distinctive features included a button at the back of the collar. Daphne Sherman, Ben Sherman\u2019s widow, said: \u201cI\u2019m not sure about the quality of the cloth [now] because, going way back, the main thing Ben insisted on was getting the cloth right. \u201cThe first shirts\u2019 success was based on the Oxford cloth, which you could only get from America. The quality was very, very important.\u201d Sherman opened a store on Carnaby Street, the centre of swinging London, and was barely able to meet demand for his shirts as Roger Daltrey of the Who and other young dandies sought more shirts. In 1970 Sherman ordered 1.5m square yards of cloth from his US fabric mill. George Best wore the shirts and stocked them at his Manchester men\u2019s clothing boutique. Sherman sold the business in the mid-70s and retired to Australia. Ben Sherman shirts remained popular in the late 70s and early 80s as the Jam, the Specials and Madness helped them appeal to the mod revival and rude boy movements. When sportswear and global designers came to dominate fashions in the 1980s, Ben Sherman\u2019s appeal faded. But the brand revived in the 1990s when it was taken up by Oasis, Blur and other mod-influenced Britpop bands. Michael DeVirgilio, president of Marquee, which specialises in launching fashion brands into new markets, said he planned to overhaul Ben Sherman\u2019s products and sell them in Japan, South Korea and South America. He said: \u201cPart of what drew us to the brand was its history and association with different culture movements over the years. These are incredible points of history in the music scene in the UK. \u201cWe can revive that energy by reviving the relationship between the brand and the movements of today.\u201d The deal brings Marquee a second clothing brand after it bought the Italian shoe and leather goods maker Bruno Magli in February. Oxford Industries bought Ben Sherman in 2004 for \u00a380m from the private equity firm 3i but, after relying heavily on discounted sales online and through discount outlets, it put the business up for sale after it lost $10.8m (\u00a37m) last year. Terry Rawlings, who co-wrote My Favourite Shirt: a History of Ben Sherman Style, said: \u201cBen Sherman was based on mod style but then they started doing skaters\u2019 stuff and turning their back on what was their meal ticket.

The shirts\u2019 distinctive features included a button at the back of the collar.</p> <p>Daphne Sherman, Ben Sherman\u2019s widow, said: \u201cI\u2019m not sure about the quality of the cloth [now] because, going way back, the main thing Ben insisted on was getting the cloth right. <br></p> <p>\u201cThe first shirts\u2019 success was based on the Oxford cloth, which you could only get from America. The quality was very, very important.\u201d<br></p> <p>Sherman opened a store on Carnaby Street, the centre of swinging London, and was barely able to meet demand for his shirts as Roger Daltrey of the Who and other young dandies sought more shirts. <br></p> <p>In 1970 Sherman ordered 1.5m square yards of cloth from his US fabric mill. George Best wore the shirts and stocked them at his Manchester men\u2019s clothing boutique.<br></p> <p>Sherman sold the business in the mid-70s and retired to Australia. Ben Sherman shirts remained popular in the late 70s and early 80s as the Jam, the Specials and Madness helped them appeal to the mod revival and rude boy movements.</p> <p>When sportswear and global designers came to dominate fashions in the 1980s, Ben Sherman\u2019s appeal faded. But the brand revived in the 1990s when it was taken up by Oasis, Blur and other mod-influenced Britpop bands. </p> <p>Michael DeVirgilio, president of Marquee, which specialises in launching fashion brands into new markets, said he planned to overhaul Ben Sherman\u2019s products and sell them in Japan, South Korea and South America.</p> <p>He said: \u201cPart of what drew us to the brand was its history and association with different culture movements over the years. These are incredible points of history in the music scene in the UK. <br></p> <p>\u201cWe can revive that energy by reviving the relationship between the brand and the movements of today.\u201d</p> <p>The deal brings Marquee a second clothing brand after it bought the Italian shoe and leather goods maker Bruno Magli in February. </p> <p>Oxford Industries bought Ben Sherman in 2004 for \u00a380m from the private equity firm 3i but, after relying heavily on discounted sales online and through discount outlets, it put the business up for sale after it lost $10.8m (\u00a37m) last year. </p> <p>Terry Rawlings, who co-wrote My Favourite Shirt: a History of Ben Sherman Style, said: \u201cBen Sherman was based on mod style but then they started doing skaters\u2019 stuff and turning their back on what was their meal ticket. They would put a target on something and think that made it mod.\u201d</p> <p>In a rare nod to the brand\u2019s past, Paul Weller, the Jam\u2019s former singer, designed a range of 60s-influenced shirts in 2007.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2007/may/13/fashion.features\">Weller said at the time</a>: \u201cI had to really save for my first Ben Sherman ... the first one I ever got was a lemon yellow one.

For the first time the Bank of England asked for the public\u2019s opinion on who should appear on the note \u2013 436 eligible contenders emerged from around 19,000 nominations. The two-month public nomination period closed on Sunday. Among the nominees to replace economist Adam Smith on the \u00a320 note, who must come from the world of visual arts and no longer be alive, are comic actor Charlie Chaplin and Welsh fashion designer Laura Ashley. Film director Alfred Hitchcock, whose works include The Birds and Psycho, and wax sculptor Marie Tussaud are also among the contenders. Bank of England officials will now draw up a shortlist of three to five names. Its governor, Mark Carney, will make the final decision which will be announced in spring 2016, alongside a concept image showing the portrait as it will appear on the note. Chief cashier Victoria Cleland said: \u201cThe fact that so many visual artists have been put forward underlines the extent of British achievement in the visual arts and reinforces why this field deserves to be recognised on the next \u00a320 note.\u201d Among the 436 nominations, only 90 are women. In July 2013, Jane Austen was confirmed as the next face of the \u00a310 note in a victory for campaigners demanding female representation \u2013 aside from the Queen \u2013 on the country\u2019s cash. The announcement to place Austen on the \u00a310 note was aimed at quelling a three-month storm of protest unleashed when the former Bank governor, Sir Meryvn King, announced that the only woman to appear on an English banknote other than the Queen \u2013 the prison reformer Elizabeth Fry \u2013 would be replaced by Winston Churchill, probably in 2016. Other female nominees for the \u00a320 note include dressmaker Jean Muir, ceramic artist Jessie Tait and sculptor Barbara Hepworth. However, the list is dominated by men, including film director Anthony Minghella, sculptor Henry Moore, actors Laurence Olivier and Richard Attenborough, comedian Mel Smith and documentary maker Tim Hetherington, who was killed in Libya in 2011 while covering the country\u2019s civil war.",

      "bodyText": "Campaigners challenging big businesses over low pay have received a major boost after Ikea became the first large national retailer to commit to paying its UK staff the living wage. The announcement that the home furnishing retailer will pay its staff a minimum of \u00a39.15 an hour in London and \u00a37.85 across the rest of the UK from April next year was described as a \u201cmassive breakthrough\u201d by the living wage campaign. It will mean a pay rise for more than 4,500 staff. In recent weeks, pressure groups and individuals have been turning up at the annual shareholder meetings of retailers such as Tesco, Next and Ocado to demand better pay for workers. Rhys Moore, director of the Living Wage Foundation, told the Guardian: \u201cThe experience of the campaign throughout has been that you need a first mover in every sector. This opens up some fruitful conversations with others who have said this is impossible in retail and it can\u2019t be done. It can.\u201d The foundation has accredited more than 1,600 businesses, including nearly a quarter of the FTSE 100 and well-known companies such as Nestle, Nationwide and British Gas \u2013 but until now, the only household name retailer that had signed up was Burberry. Campaigners will continue to press the biggest chains, such as Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s and Next, to pay the voluntary rate, which is calculated according to the cost of living. Ikea\u2019s move comes less than a fortnight after George Osborne used his post-election budget to announce that the \u00a36.50-an-hour minimum wage would be recast as the \u201cnational living wage\u201d and rise next April to \u00a37.20 for people aged over 25, with further increases to \u201cover \u00a39\u201d by 2020. Moore said a strong national minimum wage was a great boost, \u201cbut the issue remains that for many UK employees, despite working hard, their rates of pay simply don\u2019t cover the costs of living. The living wage remains key to tackling in-work poverty in the UK\u201d. Last month, Tesco boss Dave Lewis told campaigners that the retailer was in detailed talks with the trade union Usdaw about restructuring pay packages to increase basic salary. But he insisted the total amount available for workers could not be increased this year. In May, Ocado said that the vast majority of its staff were already earning above the living wage, once benefits such as bonuses were taken into account. Ikea said more than 50% of its 9,000 UK \u201cco-workers\u201d would benefit from a wage increase as a result of its move, and added: \u201cIntroducing the living wage is not only the right thing to do for our co-workers, but it also makes good business sense. This is a long-term investment in our people based on our values and our belief that a team with good compensation and working conditions is in a position to provide a great experience to our customers.\u201d Ikea has also been boosting the pay of its US workers: last month the Swedish chain announced that in January 2016 it will raise the minimum hourly wage by 10% to $11.87, following a previous increase to the current level of $10.76. The London living wage \u2013 currently \u00a39.15 an hour \u2013 is set annually by the Greater London Authority. The rate for outside London \u2013 currently \u00a37.85 an hour \u2013 is set annually by the Centre for Research in Social Policy at Loughborough University. In November, the foundation will launch a new consumer campaign, and will unveil an app allowing people looking for a particular product to find a retailer, business or cafe that pays its staff the living wage. \u2022 This story was amended on 20 July 2015. An earlier version said the majority of Ocado staff were already earning above the minimum wage.",
