If successful, the terms could be used to market products such as soap, detergents and air fresheners in order to attract younger consumers. P&amp;G registered the trademark applications with the US Patent and Trademark Office in April. The newly branded products would be sold alongside well known items such as Febreze, Fairy and Mr Clean. Alongside LOL (laughing out loud) and WTF (what the fuck), other acronyms P&amp;G has applied to trademark are NBD (no big deal) and FML (fuck my life). The company\u2019s applications have not yet been approved. According to Ad Age, the trademark office has requested clarification regarding the applications and P&amp;G has until January to respond. P&amp;G board member Nelson Peltz told CNBC in March that younger consumers did not want \u201cone size fits all\u201d brands but products \u201cthey have an emotional attachment to\u201d. According to the statistics portal Statista, millennials in the US are expected to increase their annual spending to $1.4tn (\u00a31.09tn) by 2020. P&amp;G are not the first company to try to trademark well known terms. In the US, the New England Patriots tried to trademark \u201c19-0\u201d, a reference to an unbeaten season, just two weeks before they lost the Super Bowl to the New York Giants. When Walmart first tried to trademark the yellow smiley face, which has been around since the 1970s. It got into legal battles with a rival claim from Franklin Loufrani, the president of The Smiley Company in Brussels (which has registered the trademark in over 100 countries), and lost in an attempt to sue the artist Charles Smith for parodying the symbol. They later settled out of court, and Walmart has the trademark in the US. More successful were Facebook, who trademarked the word \u201cface\u201d in reference to telecommunication services. Paris Hilton owns the words \u201cthat\u2019s hot\u201d and successfully sued Hallmark greetings cards for using it, while celebrity stylist Rachel Zoe trademarked \u201cbananas\u201d. Disney applied to trademark the name D\u00eda de los Muertos (Day of the Dead), but a petition that attracted more than 21,000 signatures in less than 24 hours forced the company to withdraw the application. In Britain, Chanel\u2019s attempt to trademark the name Jersey was denied by the UK\u2019s Intellectual Property Office. \u201cIt was important that we challenged this,\u201d said Jersey senator Alan Maclean at the time. \u201cThis was about ownership of the name Jersey. It is not about stopping Chanel using the name.\u201d Procter &amp; Gamble has been contacted for comment. \u2022 This article was amended on 4 and 12 September 2018 to amend details about trademarks relating to the yellow smiley face.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Federal Reserve chairman has defended the central bank\u2019s approach of gradually raising interest rates, after direct criticism from Donald Trump. Jerome Powell, who was this week attacked by the president for failing to give him \u201csome help\u201d on the US economy, warned that steadily rising borrowing costs would be required to promote job creation and economic growth. Trump had suggested that a change of course would be better for the country. Powell\u2019s comments at the annual gathering of economic policymakers in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, will be viewed as a rebuke to the president. Trump on Monday had directly attacked Powell, saying he was \u201cnot thrilled\u201d with him for raising interest rates. Without taking on the president\u2019s criticism directly, Powell stuck to his guns at the meeting of central bankers and academics from around the world, which is regarded as a key event for the world economy. He said the Fed\u2019s current strategy of steady rises balanced the risks between moving too quickly, which could limit economic expansion, and raising rates too slowly, which could lead to overheating. \u201cI see the current path of gradually raising interest rates \u2026 to taking seriously both of these risks,\u201d he said. Although Trump appointed Powell, he criticised the Fed chairman for not doing enough to support trade negotiations around the world by setting monetary policy to support the US economy. American presidents rarely criticise the Fed because its independence is viewed as important for US economic stability. However, Trump said he disagreed with the central bank\u2019s policy of raising rates because it could hurt the economy, and promised to maintain his criticism if Powell kept increasing the cost of borrowing. \u201cI\u2019m not thrilled with his raising of interest rates, no. I\u2019m not thrilled,\u201d Trump said in an interview with Reuters. The president nominated Powell last year to replace Janet Yellen. Powell said in his Jackson Hole speech: \u201cThe economy is strong. Inflation is near our 2% objective, and most people who want a job are finding one \u2026 If the strong growth in income and jobs continues, further gradual increases \u2026 will likely be appropriate.\u201d With Powell sticking to his guns, \u201cthe news won\u2019t be welcomed by president Donald Trump\u201d, said Andrew Hunter, US economist at the consultancy Capital Economics. \u201cThe clear message from Fed officials is that they remain committed to their plans.\u201d Most economists believe the Fed will raise interest rates again when it next meets to consider borrowing costs in September. Having begun raising rates before many other central banks around the world in 2015, the steady increases have strengthened the dollar. In recent months, some emerging market economies with high borrowing costs in dollars have suffered as a consequence, including Turkey, where the lira has plunged in value, sparking an economic crisis. Powell said that if the economic outlook markedly changed, the Fed would be prepared to change course. The central bank would \u201cdo whatever it takes\u201d to maintain the strength of the US economy, he said. Despite putting US consumers and companies on notice for higher borrowing costs, the Fed chairman said there was little sign of US inflation rising above the 2% target. The dollar dropped on foreign exchanges after his comments, amid speculation that weaker price growth may prevent the Fed from making additional rate increases. Some economists believe the Fed is moving too slowly given the low unemployment in the US, which could increase the bargaining power of workers to demand higher wages, stoking inflation. Others believe the economy will begin to slow, and that additional rate increases could exacerbate the slowdown.",

    "webTitle": "Markets wary as US-China trade talks end without breakthrough - as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Markets continue to drift as the concerns about the US-China trade rift continue, along with uncertainty about how the problems facing Donald Trump will play out. The FTSE 100 is currently up just 0.17%, Germany\u2019s Dax is up a similar amount while France\u2019s Cac has climbed 0.37%. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back next week. A positive sign for the US economy with better than expected capital goods orders. The Commerce Department said new orders for non-defence capital goods excluding aircraft - seen as a key indicator for business investment - climbed by 1.4% in July. This is sharply higher than June\u2019s figure of 0.6% - itself revised upwards from 0.2% - and better than the forecasts of a 0.4% increase. But overall orders for durable goods decreased by 1.7% as demand for civilian aircraft - a volatile measure - fell. Back with Trump and Italy: Here\u2019s our story on the latest housing data: Mortgage lending in Britain dropped last month before the Bank of England raised interest rates above the level set since the financial crisis, new banking industry figures show. The industry body UK Finance said the number of mortgages approved for new house purchases dropped by 4.3% in July to 39,584 compared with the same month a year ago. City economists had forecast around 40,700, suggesting a renewed slowdown in the housing market. Threadneedle Street raised the cost of borrowing earlier this month, making it more expensive for prospective homeowners to secure a mortgage, while concerns about a no-deal Brexit are also discouraging buyers. Analysts said the rise in rates to 0.75% from 0.5% could further weigh on demand for mortgages. Samuel Tombs, the chief UK economist at the consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the figures demonstrate the housing market is fundamentally slowing, adding: \u201cThe hike [from the Bank of England] will unnerve many buyers.\u201d The full report is here: President Donald Trump offered to buy Italian sovereign bonds when he met prime minister Giuseppe Conte at the White House last month, according to the Corriere della Sera newspaper. Rome is scheduled to issue about \u20ac400bn worth of debt in 2019, and recent political uncertainty has seen a jump in Italian borrowing costs as investors move out of the country\u2019s bonds. The paper said that while Italy is keen to find new investors, it was unclear how the US could step in to guarantee the debt. Here\u2019s the view from an ING strategist: And here\u2019s the market reaction: Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB is currently up 0.75%, outpacing other European markets. Three senior executives at TSB, which suffered a disastrous IT meltdown beginning in April, are leaving the bank, according to the Financial Times. Ian Firth, Rachel Lock and Nigel Gilbert - TSB\u2019s treasurer, head of human resources and chief marketing officer - are all set to depart, says the report (\u00a3). The fiasco is the subject of independent investigations, and helped push the bank into a loss for the year: ScottishPower has become the fourth of the big six energy suppliers to announce a second price rise this year, in response to rising wholesale prices. Around 900,000 customers on the firm\u2019s default tariff will be hit with a \u00a346 price hike from 8 October, pushing up their annual dual fuel bill 3.7%, to \u00a31,257. The bad news for consumers comes on top of a 5.5% hike by ScottishPower in June. The company, which is owned by Spanish energy giant Iberdrola, blamed wholesale electricity and gas costs, which it had said had increased more than a fifth since April. Analysts have warned householders to expect further price rises, and one challenger firm, Bulb, has told customers a third rise this year is likely. Oil is being lifted again amid signs that US sanctions on Iran are beginning to have an impact on supplies. Brent crude is up 0.8% at $75.33 a barrel while US crude has climbed 0.9% to $68.45. The US government re-imposed sanctions on Iran this month after it withdrew from a 2015 international nuclear agreement. Jason Gammel, equity analyst at investment bank Jefferies, said: Multiple third-party reports indicate that Iranian tanker loadings are already down by around 700 kbd in the first half of August relative to July, which if it holds will exceed most expectations. We expect that by the fourth quarter the market will be dealing with either undersupply, dwindling spare capacity - or both. The UK mortgage figures are weighing on housebuilders, with Berkeley Group, Persimmon, Barratt Developments and Taylor Wimpey all down around 1%. A downgrade on Persimmon from analysts at Canaccord is not helping the sector. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: In thin August trading housebuilders have taken a knock as a double whammy of lower new approved mortgages and a five-month low in net mortgage lending weighed on the sector. Fortunately, the lower weighting for the likes of Taylor Wimpey in the FTSE means that these losses have been easily countered by gains for mining stocks off the back of a weaker US dollar. So overall the FTSE 100 remains virtually unchanged, edging up 0.12%. The number of mortgage approvals by the main high street banks slipped last month compared to a year ago. Approvals in July fell by 0.8%, but within this there was a 2.8% rise in existing households remortgaging ahead of the well-flagged interest rate rise earlier this month, according to data from industry body UK Finance. Credit card spending was 8.1% higher that a year earlier, but annual consumer credit growth slowed to 3.7%. Peter Tyler, director at UK Finance, said: July saw steady growth in gross mortgage lending, driven largely by remortgaging as homeowners locked into attractive deals in anticipation of the recent base rate rise. Card spending has also strengthened, reflecting increased expenditure during the holiday period and an uplift in retail sales due to the World Cup and warm weather. However the broader economic outlook remains mixed, with households continuing to see their incomes being squeezed by rising inflation. This may explain the shift towards deposits held in instant access accounts, as consumers opt to keep their money close to hand. With the European Central Bank being the latest to warn of the dangers of growing protectionism (in Thursday\u2019s minutes), here\u2019s an interesting chart from HSBC (hat-tip Ransquawk): So would the markets crash if Donald Trump was impeached, as the president suggested? Paul Donovan, global chief economist at UBS Wealth Management, thinks not: Impeachment (by the House) may be more likely than conviction (by the Senate), but neither seems highly probable. A conviction would lead to President Pence. Pence\u2019s economic track record gives no grounds for assuming a negative equity reaction. The markets may be fairly subdued at the moment, but it could be a lot worse, says Spreadex financial analyst Connor Campbell: There wasn\u2019t a lot to Friday\u2019s open, the lack of progress between the US and China following the latest round of trade talks leading to a muted start to the session. Given the amount of bad news out there at the moment \u2013 from Thursday\u2019s trade talk-undermining tariff tit-for-tatting between the US and China, the ominous clouds of a no deal Brexit, and Trump\u2019s potential legal problems \u2013 the markets have done well to not lose their heads this week. The FTSE was unchanged after the bell, lurking just above 7560. The index failed to capitalise on a rebound from its mining stocks, that sector having been something of a burden in the last few sessions. The pound, meanwhile, needs to try and claw back the losses it incurred followed Dominic Raab\u2019s poorly received no deal Brexit advice on Thursday. It hasn\u2019t been particularly successful so far: against the dollar it rose 0.1%, pushing cable above $1.283, while against the euro it actually slipped another 0.1%, keeping it the wrong side of \u20ac1.11 for the first time in over a fortnight. As for the Eurozone indices, a solid second quarter German GDP reading \u2013 it was confirmed at 0.5% \u2013 allowed the DAX to nudge 20 points higher. The CAC, meanwhile, could only add a handful of points, pushing above 5425 in the process. News of the latest prime ministerial appointment in Australia has seen a recovery in the country\u2019s currency. Neil Wilson at Markets.com said: Australia\u2019s dollar rose after Scott Morrison was voted the next prime minister. The Australian dollar/US dollar had sold off as Malcolm Turnbull was forced to resign, briefly touching on 0.720, its lowest since the start of 2017, before paring losses to trade around 0.7280. But the longer-term downtrend remains in play with trend resistance seen at 0.73750. Politics won\u2019t be a factor for long for the Australian dollar, which tends to ride this kind of shenanigans \u2013forex traders should be pretty used to a changing Australian prime ministers and will shrug it off quickly. With the continuing trade row between the US and China, Trump\u2019s travails and the spotlight on US interest rates, markets are making a cautious end to the week. The FTSE 100 is virtually flat, Germany\u2019s Dax is up 0.25%, France\u2019s Cac has climbed just 0.12% while Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB is up 0.1%. On the trade dispute, Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com said: With the US mulling $200bn in additional 25% tariffs, this is not going away. The real worry is what does China do then. While Beijing cannot match the US in terms of raw firepower as it imports far less from the US, it can respond with \u2018qualitative\u2019 measures, which could seriously impede US firms doing business in China. The German GDP figures show that the country\u2019s economy has not yet been hit too badly by the current trade tensions, says ING Bank economist Carsten Brzeski, although this could of course change: German growth data suggest that at least in the second quarter, the ongoing trade tensions were a threat but did not leave any significant marks on the economy. Obviously, this could change in the coming months. Even though the EU seems to be off US radar screens at least for the time being, the series of German export partners being hurt by sanctions, tariffs or economic crises is getting longer. Just think of China, Russia, Turkey, Iran or potentially the UK. The strength of the German export sector has always been its diversity and the fact that it is not dependent on a single export partner. And while the weak euro should cushion any adverse effects stemming from tariffs or sanctions, the list of troubled countries should obviously not get too long. While risks from the external side are increasing, the domestic side of the German economy offers both challenges but also opportunities. Just think of an increasingly complicated political landscape, too few new investments and structural reforms and supply-side constraints in the manufacturing sector. Many potential risks ahead but at least for now, there is only one good reaction to today\u2019s growth data: enjoy and savour. Here are IG\u2019s opening calls for European markets: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. There was little expectation that this week\u2019s talks between the US and China to resolve their trade tensions would make much of a breakthrough. And so it proved, as they ended on Thursday with no real progress. President Trump had already set the tone, suggesting there was unlikely to be any quick resolution, and discussions can hardly have been helped by the two sides slapping a new range of tariffs on each others\u2019 goods as the talks were underway. White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said the officials \u201cexchanged views on how to achieve fairness, balance, and reciprocity in the economic relationship\u201d and the discussions including \u201caddressing structural issues in China\u201d including its intellectual property and technology transfer policies. Later China\u2019s finance minister Liu Kun told Reuters the country would keep hitting back at the US. He said: China doesn\u2019t wish to engage in a trade war, but we will resolutely respond to the unreasonable measures taken by the United States. Economists at UniCredit said a new round of tariffs was likely to come into force in September, with the US targeting $200bn of imports from China: \u201cBeijing is said to be willing to start new talks only after the US mid-term elections.\u201d So markets continue to be edgy as the row rumbles on, with Wall Street finishing in the red and Asian markets vacillated between negative and positive. European markets are expected to make a mixed start. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: A spokesperson for the Beijing administration described the meeting as \u2018constructive\u2019, but it sends a message to traders that this situation won\u2019t be resolved quickly. The negative press surrounding President Trump isn\u2019t boosting investor confidence either. Indeed Trump declared that impeaching him would lead to a stock market crash, although the thing markets hate most is uncertainty, which is what we have here. Elsewhere US Federal Reserve members speaking at the two day meeting of central bankers at Jackson Hole in Wyoming tried to make it clear that despite Trump\u2019s criticism of their rate raising policy, they would not be swayed by his comments. CMC\u2019s Madden said: Esther George, the Kansas City Fed President issued an upbeat view of the US economy, as she believes the Federal Reserve can hike interest rates several more times before it can get to a \u2018neutral\u2019 position. Ms George made it clear that President Trump\u2019s views regarding the hiking cycle, will not influence the central bank. Robert Kaplan, Dallas Fed President, reiterated the independence of the Federal Reserve, making it clear that Mr Trump\u2019s won\u2019t influence decisions in relation to interest rates. The stimulus effect is boosting the economy, but it will start to fade in 2019, according to Mr Kaplan. There is little economic news expected, with US durable goods due at 1.30 UK time. We have already had the latest German GDP figures, which showed a 0.5% rise in the second quarter, the same as the previous three months and in line with expectations. Year on year the figure was 2.3%, again as forecast.",

Just think of China, Russia, Turkey, Iran or potentially the UK.

And so it proved, as they ended on Thursday with no real progress. President Trump had already set the tone, suggesting there was unlikely to be any quick resolution, and discussions can hardly have been helped by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/aug/23/us-china-escalate-trade-war-total-sum-levied-reaches-100bn\">the two sides slapping a new range of tariffs on each others\u2019 goods </a>as the talks were underway.</p> <p>White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said the officials \u201cexchanged views on how to achieve fairness, balance, and reciprocity in the economic relationship\u201d and the discussions including \u201caddressing structural issues in China\u201d including its intellectual property and technology transfer policies.</p> <p>Later China\u2019s finance minister Liu Kun told Reuters the country would keep hitting back at the US. He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>China doesn\u2019t wish to engage in a trade war, but we will resolutely respond to the unreasonable measures taken by the United States.</p> </blockquote> <p>Economists at UniCredit said a new round of tariffs was likely to come into force in September, with the US targeting $200bn of imports from China: \u201cBeijing is said to be willing to start new talks only after the US mid-term elections.\u201d</p> <p>So markets continue to be edgy as the row rumbles on, with Wall Street finishing in the red and Asian markets vacillated between negative and positive. European markets are expected to make a mixed start. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A spokesperson for the Beijing administration described the meeting as \u2018constructive\u2019, but it sends a message to traders that this situation won\u2019t be resolved quickly. The negative press surrounding President Trump isn\u2019t boosting investor confidence either. </p> </blockquote> <p>Indeed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/aug/23/trump-michael-cohen-flipping-should-be-illegal-warns-against-impeachment\">Trump declared that impeaching him would lead to a stock market crash</a>, although the thing markets hate most is uncertainty, which is what we have here.</p> <p>Elsewhere US Federal Reserve members speaking at the two day meeting of central bankers at Jackson Hole in Wyoming tried to make it clear that despite Trump\u2019s criticism of their rate raising policy, they would not be swayed by his comments. CMC\u2019s Madden said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Esther George, the Kansas City Fed President issued an upbeat view of the US economy, as she believes the Federal Reserve can hike interest rates several more times before it can get to a \u2018neutral\u2019 position. Ms George made it clear that President Trump\u2019s views regarding the hiking cycle, will not influence the central bank. Robert Kaplan, Dallas Fed President, reiterated the independence of the Federal Reserve, making it clear that Mr Trump\u2019s won\u2019t influence decisions in relation to interest rates. The stimulus effect is boosting the economy, but it will start to fade in 2019, according to Mr Kaplan. </p> </blockquote> <p>There is little economic news expected, with US durable goods due at 1.30 UK time.</p> <p>We have already had the latest German GDP figures, which showed a 0.5% rise in the second quarter, the same as the previous three months and in line with expectations. Year on year the figure was 2.3%, again as forecast.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2018-08-24T06:57:36.290Z\">at 7.57am BST</time></p>  </div>",

Dominic Chappell, who had no previous retail experience, bought the high street chain from the billionaire Sir Philip Green for \u00a31 in March 2015. The company collapsed with the loss of 11,000 jobs 13 months later, leaving a pension deficit of about \u00a3571m. In the wake of the collapse, the Pensions Regulator moved to protect the pensions of 19,000 members and requested documents from Chappell. When he failed to comply with the section 72 request, the regulator took Chappell to court and he was found guilty and fined. Thrice-bankrupt Chappell, 51, of Blandford Forum, Dorset, has launched an appeal against the conviction. At a preliminary hearing at Hove crown court on Friday, his solicitor, Michael Levy, said the regulator\u2019s requests for \u201cthousands and thousands\u201d of documents were disproportionate and Chappell had been bound to fail. He said the regulator was under political pressure to take action against Chappell over the collapse. Levy said: \u201cSome issues are political. We say it has a relevance. The Pensions Regulator was under pressure to do something and be seen to be responding politically at the time.\u201d He said that under the section 72 notice the regulator requested a huge amount of documentation relating to the pensions but gave him less than a fortnight to supply it. He said Chappell employed a team to go through the material but they were unable to meet the deadline. Levy said a second \u201cdisproportionate\u201d section 72 notice, issued weeks later, made similar requests with whichhe was unable to comply. He said: \u201cWhen the TPR makes a request the question is: does it have to be reasonable and proportionate? And our position is that it does. Some regard has to be had with regard to the size of the task involved. \u201cIn this case there is thousands and thousands of documents. There were 17 lever-arch files of documents and thousands and thousands and thousands of pages are attached to the notice.\u201d Chappell was fined \u00a350,000 with \u00a337,000 costs after being found guilty of failing to disclose vital details to the pensions watchdog as part of its investigation into the collapse of the high street chain. The judge proposed he pay \u00a32,500 a month. Chappell, who was not in court, will appeal against his conviction on 17 September.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "As high street retailers struggle with store closures and bankruptcies, an online auctioneer is thriving. John Pye Auctions operates a digital bootsale that helps clear stock from collapsed shop chains, closed down restaurants and failed manufacturers. On a Monday morning in August, a traffic jam at a secluded industrial estate in rural Staffordshire indicates that the firm is doing brisk business. Hundreds of would-be buyers are flocking to a public viewing at John Pye\u2019s Marchington warehouse to scour for bargain furniture, TVs, cars and even Christmas baubles at its latest sale. The business also works with successful retailers, including John Lewis and Made.com, as well as several major pawnbrokers, to help clear unwanted stock and items returned by online shoppers that cannot be directly resold. John Pye is having a good year. Sales are up by more than 35% in the first six months of 2018, year on year, and are expected to continue that trend in the next six months. The company recently cleared hundreds of pieces of furniture from the collapsed Fabb Sofas and from two casual dining chains which have been closing outlets. \u201cWe\u2019ve had the best start to the year since the last recession in 2008,\u201d says Sheldon Miller, business development director for the family-owned business. Last year Pye\u2019s profits more than tripled to more than \u00a31.1m partly thanks to a government contract to sell off cars seized by the DVLA. By midday in Marchington there are nearly 2,000 people bouncing on sofas, peering into fridges, kicking car tyres and poking around in boxes of assorted retail flotsam, from broken beds to computer games. After noting down the lot numbers, they then bid for the items online. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing you can mention we haven\u2019t sold - except livestock,\u201d says 87-year-old founder John Pye. Pye began trading in 1946, helping people move home with a cart and former pit pony called Spanker. The auction business began as a way to clear belongings his clients no longer wanted and took off when he moved to the Corn Exchange in Nottingham\u2019s Cattle Market in 1969. He now presides over an empire with 22 sites, 13 of which are dedicated to selling cars, and six general viewing sites including one on Bond Street, in London\u2019s West End, dedicated to selling luxury jewellery and art. There also a 315,000 sq ft site in Port Talbot, Wales. About 15 articulated lorries of goods arrive each day at Marchington alone, contributing to 30,000 lots a week across the business. Pye put down his gavel 12 years ago, when his son took over and moved all the auctions online. In his heyday, Pye would be calling bids from just a few hundred professional dealers. Today the business has 275,000 registered bidders, 70% of whom are shopping for themselves. In Marchington, families with kids stop for a bacon sandwich in the coffee shop and vie for goods with landlords fitting out properties and small traders buying to sell on eBay or in a local shop. \u201cEvery type of person you can think of buys here,\u201d says Pye. \u201cWe have one dealer who has spent about \u00a3100,000 online with us and we\u2019ve never seen him.\u201d Apart from the luxury items, nothing has a reserve price and items go for an average of 20% of their retail sale price. Everything is sold as seen and nothing can be returned so savvy bidders visit to check if their dream sofa has a missing leg. Pye doesn\u2019t own the stock; it takes a cut from the sale price with the rest going back to the retailer. Maxine Dolman, from Burton upon Trent, is a regular, having bought an John Lewis patio set from John Pye via a series of bids for a fraction of its retail price. \u201cI got a table, a love seat, two footstools. I did buy a Vax that didn\u2019t work and a three-legged sofa. You have to be careful as you can\u2019t always see what works, but what a bargain if you get it right.\u201d Martin McMinn from Derby, who is visiting the showrooms for the first time, is disappointed that there are no Dysons. \u201cThere\u2019s quite a lot of tat here and would I buy something with no guarantee? But my mate visits all the time and loves checking out the website.\u201d Even fans admit that any purchase is a gamble, but it hasn\u2019t stopped John Pye selling boats, Formula 1 cars, perfume, fine wines, enormous machinery and even aeroplanes in the past. Earlier this year, the company auctioned off 486 wedding dresses after a chain went bust. It rigged up changing rooms and put on Prosecco for prospective buyers and cleared the lot for about 15% of its retail value. As the retail closures mount up, Miller says he expects a busy end to the year. \u201cThis is only the tip of the iceberg. Interests rates are going up and I suspect there is going to be double whammy with a squeeze on consumer spending. A lot of people are maxed out. It\u2019s tough times on the high street.\u201d But he takes no pleasure from the problems retailers are currently facing: \u201cWe don\u2019t want to see retailers going bust. We get more business as a supporter to retail clients. We want those ongoing partnerships.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Mortgage lending in Britain dropped last month before the Bank of England raised interest rates above the level set since the financial crisis, new banking industry figures show. The industry body UK Finance said the number of mortgages approved for new house purchases dropped by 4.3% in July to 39,584 compared with the same month a year ago. City economists had forecast around 40,700, suggesting a renewed slowdown in the housing market. Threadneedle Street raised the cost of borrowing earlier this month, making it more expensive for prospective homeowners to secure a mortgage, while concerns about a no-deal Brexit are also discouraging buyers. Analysts said the rise in rates to 0.75% from 0.5% could further weigh on demand for mortgages. Samuel Tombs, the chief UK economist at the consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the figures demonstrate the housing market is fundamentally slowing, adding: \u201cThe hike [from the Bank of England] will unnerve many buyers.\u201d The latest snapshot of the mortgage market comes as British households face sluggish wage growth and higher levels of inflation since the Brexit vote. Peter Tyler, a director at UK Finance, said: \u201cThe broader economic outlook remains mixed, with households continuing to see their incomes being squeezed by rising inflation.\u201d Earlier this month, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors reported broadly flat new-buyer enquiries and newly agreed sales in July. Some surveyors said Brexit was restraining sellers, while hot weather and the school summer holidays also had an impact. House-price growth across the country has been slowing in recent months, with property values in London falling for the first time since the financial crisis. The Office for National Statistics said the north-east is the only region in which house prices are yet to surpass their 2008 levels. While the price of a property in England has grown by 25.3% between 2007 and 2017, the north-east has fallen by 7.1% over the same period. Statisticians said there was a larger supply of homes versus the rest of the country, while falling numbers of people between the ages of 16 to 64 had weighed on the demand for homes. The figures do, however, suggest buying property in the north-east region has become more affordable in real terms over the past decade, versus the London market, amid a growing north-south divide. Tanya Jackson of Yorkshire Building Society said: \u201cThere is a distinct divide between the north and south of the country when it comes to house-price growth in relation to wage growth, which has become even more pronounced since the financial crash.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Government advisers have urged Norway not to ditch oil and gas investments from its $1tn sovereign wealth fund, in a setback for those backing the world\u2019s biggest fossil fuel divestment. Norway\u2019s central bank last year recommended the fund sell the billions it holds in oil stocks to avoid the risk of a permanent drop in crude prices. However, a government-appointed commission has rejected the proposal, warning that a less diverse investment strategy would have major consequences for the fund\u2019s returns. \u201cA sale of energy stocks would challenge the current investment strategy of the fund, with broad diversification of the investments and a high threshold for exclusion,\u201d the commission said on Friday. The Government Pension Fund Global was built off the oil and gas revenues that have made Norway rich. It also has major holdings in international oil firms, including $6.14bn in Shell, followed by billions of dollars invested in other oil majors such as BP, Chevron, ExxonMobil and Total. It has smaller stakes in the Italian oil firm Eni, the US oil firm ConocoPhillips and the US oil services group Schlumberger. Most oil company share prices have climbed in the past year along with crude prices. Divesting those stocks was \u201cnot an effective insurance\u201d against the \u201csubstantial\u201d hit Norway faced to its tax take if its oil and gas sector was hurt by an oil price crash, the commission argued. The commission, headed by the economist \u00d8ystein Th\u00f8gersen, said the fund\u2019s existing investment strategy was \u201csimple, well founded and has served the fund well\u201d. Nicol\u00f2 Wojewoda, the Europe team leader at the climate campaign group 350.org, said: \u201cThis summer Nordic heatwaves, wildfires in the Arctic Circle and alarming news of the thickest Arctic sea ice starting to break up, have brought climate change so close to home for Norway. It seems unthinkable to continue to invest in companies that have caused this chaos.\u201d The government said a final decision would be made this autumn. Siv Jensen, the minister of finance, said: \u201cTogether with the advice from Norges Bank [the central bank] and the public consultation of the bank\u2019s advice, this report will constitute a solid foundation for decision-making.\u201d Norway\u2019s state-owned oil company Statoil earlier this year rebranded itself as Equinor, to reflect what it said was its new role as a \u201cbroad energy company\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "Ryanair will no longer let passengers take a small suitcase on its planes for free, with charges for a 10kg case to be introduced in November. The airline overhauled its baggage policy as recently as January but said the current scheme, which allows people to hand in their smaller cases for loading in the hold for free at the boarding gate, was still causing delays. Overhead locker space has failed to match demand, with an increasing number of passengers adapting their packing habits to escape baggage charges on budget carriers. Passengers will still be allowed to carry on one small bag that can fit under a seat in front, free of charge. A limited number of passengers who book priority boarding \u2013 which costs \u00a36 or \u20ac6 per flight \u2013 will be able to take on a small case as hand luggage. However, Ryanair is introducing a lower rate for smaller, checked-in baggage. Passengers will pay \u00a38 \u2013 rather than \u00a325 \u2013 for any case weighing less than 10kg. The airline said most of its customers would be unaffected by the bag policy change, saying that 30% already buy priority boarding and another 30% already travel with only one small carry-on bag. Ryanair said the change would be revenue neutral, as many people would switch to checking in a cheaper, smaller suitcase, and was aimed purely at reducing delays to flights caused by too much luggage at the boarding gate. Kenny Jacobs, Ryanair\u2019s chief marketing officer, said: \u201cThis new policy will speed up the boarding and cut flight delays. 60% of customers will be unaffected by these changes and we expect that the other 40% will either choose to buy priority boarding or a 10kg check bag, or will choose to travel with only one free small bag.\u201d The overhead lockers on Ryanair\u2019s Boeing 737 fleet can accommodate about 100 suitcases, while the number of priority tickets sold will be capped at 95 \u2013 roughly half the maximum passengers per flight. The size limit of the small, free bag has also been slightly increased, but anyone who fails to fit that bag in the sizer at the airport will be charged \u00a325 or \u20ac25 and have the bag put in the hold. Ryanair has long grappled to find the best solution to its baggage issues. Its chief executive, Michael O\u2019Leary, imposed high checked-in baggage fees for many years in an effort to keep down handling costs, claiming to be doing customers and the environment a favour by encouraging passengers to travel light. The first change imposed in January saw small carry-on cases taken at the gate and put in the aircraft hold for free, with only passengers who had booked priority boarding, then \u00a35, allowed to put cases in the cabin\u2019s overhead lockers. The move was accepted with equanimity by passengers but did not solve the gate delays.",
