      "bodyText": "What have David Cameron (Tory prime minister, 2010-16), and Harold Wilson (Labour prime minister, 1964-70 and 1974-76) got in common? Answer: in order to keep their respective parties together, because they were split over \u201cEurope\u201d, each of them called a referendum. Wilson triumphed, and went down in history as a consummate politician, indeed statesman. Cameron failed lamentably, and his mishandling of this vital issue is sometimes described as the biggest prime ministerial disaster brought upon the nation since Lord North lost the American colonies. The Conservative party is probably split even more over Europe now than it was before; and, although the extent of the disaster is dawning only slowly on the British public, most foreigners I meet \u2013 from France to Japan \u2013 scratch their heads and ask \u201cwhy has your once great country voted to commit economic suicide?\u201d Why indeed. Well, one points out to them that only 37% of the electorate voted to leave; that the referendum was \u201cadvisory\u201d; and that, when he feared he was going to lose by a narrow margin, the egregious Nigel Farage stated that, in the event of a close vote, there should be another referendum. The narrowness of the result does not, sad to say, prevent distinguished BBC interviewers who ought to know better from prefacing questions with preambles such as \u201cwe know the nation voted to take back control, but\u2026 \u201d The nation? Well, a small proportion of it. Control? Alas, one fears that many Brexiters had only the vaguest understanding of what that actually meant. \u201cCountry back\u201d? A country much of whose industry and public utilities are foreign-owned? The sheer folly of this self-inflicted wound is illustrated by the fact that, until it was called, our relationship with the rest of the European Union was way down the list of people\u2019s concerns in repeated surveys. However, Cameron lifted the stone, and Ukip had a field day. What continues to mystify is the way that worshippers of Margaret Thatcher on the right of the Conservative party have turned against her. After the two-to-one vote in favour of Remain in 1975, Thatcher joined in \u201crejoicing over this excellent result\u201d. She added: \u201cAlso, one cannot let this occasion pass without paying tribute to the vision of Sir Winston Churchill and the courage of Harold Macmillan, who made the original application.\u201d (Of course, she should also have praised Edward Heath, who succeeded in his application. But then, relations between the two were, shall we say, somewhat strained.) Joining the European single market in the mid-1990s was one of Thatcher\u2019s finest achievements. Last weekend I met a Treasury minister from those days who recalled that, at the time, Tory Eurosceptics were overjoyed by it. It is true that, in common with the Treasury and many others, Thatcher found many aspects of the European Union intensely irritating. She certainly fought her corner. But Lord Powell, the civil servant who knew her mind as well as anyone, is convinced that, had she been still with us, the heroine of the Eurosceptics (always pronounced \u201ceuroseptics\u201d by Heath) would have supported Remain. And the Treasury, that least \u201cEuropean\u201d of departments, can see when the country is heading for a cliff. Hence Philip Hammond is doing everything possible to soften the blow. But back to the party that was led by Harold Wilson, and is now in the hands of Jeremy Corbyn. Wilson was originally lukewarm about Europe, and always thought the arguments were finely balanced. Shortly before the 1975 referendum, there was a special conference of Labour\u2019s national executive at the Sobell sports centre in Islington, in the heart of what is now Corbyn\u2019s constituency. The vote was two-to-one for Leave: but as Wilson\u2019s biographer Ben Pimlott wrote, \u201cbehind the speakers\u2019 rostrum a banner had been carefully placed for the television cameras, with the message \u2018Conference Advises \u2013 the People Decide\u2019.\u201d \u201cWilson was low key. He said he was against coming out and \u2018sinking into an offshore mentality\u2019. The journalist Peter Jenkins explained that Wilson had three objectives: \u201cto keep his party in power and in one piece, and Britain in Europe\u201d. Bernard Donoughue, who worked closely with Wilson, said that while Wilson was never warm towards things European, nevertheless \u201cas a pragmatist he knew that a Yes vote was the most practical choice, because to stay in would be less disruptive politically, economically, industrially, than to pull out.\u2019 Disruption is what we now face. The optimists among my fellow Remainers are hoping for various eventualities: a long transition; a change of mind; a \u201csoft\u201d Brexit in which Britain retains most, if not all, of the advantages of the customs union and the single market. But it is becoming increasingly obvious that the complexities of any such compromise are formidable. In particular, it is difficult to believe that the other 27 regard a soft Brexit as feasible. The likelihood is that, unless sense prevails pretty soon, this chaotic government will take us over the cliff. However, it is not beyond the bounds of possibility that the government may collapse and Labour win an early election. In which case Jeremy Corbyn could do worse than to learn some lessons from Harold Wilson.",

      "bodyText": "Britain is on a consumer credit binge. Over the past year, growth per head of population has increased by 1% while the amount consumers have racked up \u2013 on their credit cards, on car finance and in unsecured personal loans \u2013 has increased by 10%. This is a matter of concern for the Bank of England, and rightly so. As Alex Brazier, the Bank\u2019s director in charge of financial stability, put it last week, we have seen this movie before \u2013 and it doesn\u2019t have a happy ending. What\u2019s happened is simple. For many employees, a decent wage increase is a thing of the past \u2013 but borrowing is cheap and easily obtainable. Living standards are under pressure because prices are rising more rapidly than earnings, and that is forcing consumers to retrench. The belt-tightening would be even more pronounced were it not for the willingness to load up on credit. Banks and other lenders have responded to a prolonged period of low interest rates and modest growth by making the terms for borrowers more attractive. It is now easier \u2013 at least in the short term \u2013 for someone to transfer their credit card balance from one company to another. The average advertised interest rate on a \u00a310,000 loan has fallen from 8% to 3.8% in the past year. As Brazier noted, these are classic signs of lenders thinking the risks are lower than they actually are. He used particularly strong language (for Threadneedle Street) in warning lenders that they were dicing with a \u201cspiral of complacency\u201d. The Bank is prepared to act within the next two months if it thinks there has been insufficient action on the part of lenders to prevent the damaging popping of a credit bubble. Only once has the household debt to income ratio been as elevated as it is now, and that was 10 years ago, when the economy was on the cusp of its deepest recession since the second world war. Most of the debt is secured against bricks and mortar, but a rising chunk of it is accounted for by personal loans, unpaid credit card debts and car loans. It was the willingness of consumers to take on extra borrowing that allowed the economy to surf through the first six months after the Brexit vote a year ago. To an extent, this was perfectly rational behaviour: consumers could see that prices were going to rise due to the fall in the value of the pound, so they loaded up on credit so that they could bring forward purchases. Some spending that would normally have taken place in the first half of 2017 actually happened in the second half of 2016. The fact that outstanding consumer debt is still rising suggests that people are no longer borrowing to fund luxury purchases but rather to make ends meet. To an extent, rising consumer debt is a problem of the Bank\u2019s own making. Its monetary policy committee has kept interest rates at 0.5% or lower for more than eight years, making it easier to keep up the payments on loans. Now the Bank\u2019s other big policy body \u2013 the financial policy committee \u2013 is worried that the borrowing could get out of hand. Both the MPC and the FPC need to be careful. Even quite modest increases in official interest rates would be a problem for many debt-dependent households. Meanwhile, if the FPC makes it harder for consumers to obtain credit from mainstream lenders, there is the risk that they will drive the borrowing underground. Ultimately, rising consumer credit is symptomatic of a wider problem: the absence of real wage growth. Since the economy plunged into recession in early 2008, real GDP per head has increased by less than 2% \u2013 comfortably the most miserable performance, apart from times when Britain has been at war, since records began in the first half of the 19th century. Debt has been rising because wages, once adjusted for inflation, have moved sideways. And wages have moved sideways because productivity growth has stalled. The way to break the UK\u2019s serious credit habit is to develop a different growth model to replace one that is clearly broken. In the meantime, lenders would be well advised to heed Brazier\u2019s warning. The Bank does not use phrases such as \u201cspiral of complacency\u201d lightly. It fears boom will lead to bust. Lenders can either exercise a bit more caution voluntarily or the Bank will force them to do so through credit controls.",
