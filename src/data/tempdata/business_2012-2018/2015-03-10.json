Lobbyists noticed last week that Burger King\u2019s online menus no longer included soda in the list of children\u2019s meals that sell a selection of food and drink items for one price. When inquiries were made, Burger King confirmed to USA Today that it had withdrawn soda from kids\u2019 meals as part of a new national policy that had been implemented online and is being rolled out across its US franchises. Children can still be served soft drinks, but they will have to be purchased separately from the combo meals designed for them. The kids\u2019 meals in Burger King will now include milk, chocolate milk, apple juice or water with the customary items such as chicken nuggets and fries, rather than sugary soda from the soft drinks fountain. The switch was made as part of an \u201congoing effort to offer our guests options that match lifestyle needs\u201d, Alex Macedo, the president of Burger King North America, told USA Today. The Center for Science in the Public Interest, a consumer advocacy group based in Washington DC, has been lobbying fast food giants for two years to take the action and praised Burger King\u2019s \u201creally important step\u201d. \u201cIf you take a hamburger, fries and a soda compared with a hamburger with a side of fruit and a water \u2013 the first one is junk, the second one is better,\u201d said Margo Wootan, the center\u2019s director of nutrition policy. \u201cSoda is the No 1 source of calories in children\u2019s diets and offering it in a kids\u2019 meal is the biggest single problem in that meal,\u201d she added. McDonald\u2019s initiated a public announcement in 2013 when it took the soda option, such as Coke, Sprite and other sugary soft drinks, out of its kids\u2019 \u201cHappy Meals\u201d combinations. Burger King did not make its own announcement and has not attributed its decision to the lobbying efforts of healthy food campaigners. \u201cIn my 20 years of working here, I\u2019m not sure if any companies have every publicly said we were responsible for their change in policy or practice,\u201d Wootan said. The Center for Science in the Public Interest is part of a coalition of campaign groups lobbying fast food companies to make all their meals more healthy, by cutting down calorie counts, saturated fat, salt and sugar. The group plans to target sit-down chains next to persuade them to stop marketing and offering soda drinks specifically to children. \u201cNext up, Applebee\u2019s,\u201d Wootan said. Wootan said the move by Burger King would make it easier for parents to say no to children\u2019s request for soda with their meals and would help prevent children from developing the habit of having sugary drinks with a meal. The percentage of children ages 6\u201311 years in the US who are obese increased from 7% in 1980 to almost 18% in 2012.

      "bodyText": "The prospect of cheaper holidays in continental Europe this summer for British and American tourists has become closer after the euro tumbled on the foreign exchanges. Amid fears of a rekindling of Greece\u2019s debt crisis, the pound climbed above \u20ac1.40 against the euro for the first time since the onset of the global financial crisis in 2007. Against the dollar, the single currency was at its lowest level for 12 years. The euro\u2019s renewed weakness came on a day of financial turbulence in which concerns about Greece, growth in China and the possibility of higher US interest rates affected sentiment across financial markets. London\u2019s FTSE-100 index fell by 174 points to close at 6,703, while in New York the Dow Jones industrial average fell 332.78 points to 17,662.94 erasing all the gains made so far this year. The cost of crude oil and industrial metals slid on signs that China\u2019s economy is slowing. But the main action was in the currency markets, where the strength of the US dollar added to pressure on a number of emerging market economies, including Mexico, where the peso fell to its lowest level on record, the Turkish lira was trading close to record lows, and the Brazilian real extended its recent decline. The euro has been on the slide since the European Central Bank announced late last year that it was launching its own quantitative easing programme. Central banks including the US Federal Reserve, the Bank of England and the Bank of Japan have used QE to create new electronic money, but one side-effect has been to drive down currencies. Since the start of 2015, the euro has fallen by more than 11% against the dollar and after a 1% fall on Tuesday was trading at just over $1.07. Currency traders are now braced for the single currency to fall below parity against the greenback over the coming months as further QE from the central bank is expected to be accompanied by the first interest rate rise in the US since the global recession. A falling currency will make exports from the eurozone cheaper but also means that visitors to Spain, Italy, France and the other members of the single currency will receive more euros in exchange for their pounds and dollars. The rising value of sterling and the dollar will also cut the cost of imports into the UK and the US, adding to deflationary pressure. Inflation has already fallen sharply as a result of falling oil prices, with Brent crude dropping on Tuesday by 2% to about $57 a barrel. But Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, ruled out the possibility that Threadneedle Street would respond to much lower than expected inflation with further cuts in interest rates or an expansion of the Bank\u2019s \u00a3375bn QE programme. Carney told a House of Lords committee on Tuesday that it would be \u201cextremely foolish\u201d to use more monetary stimulus to fight a temporary plunge in inflation caused by declining oil prices. UK inflation as measured by the consumer price index has already fallen to 0.3% \u2013 its lowest level on record \u2013 but the governor said further falls to zero were likely in the coming months, with little subsequent change for the rest of the year. \u201cThe thing that would be extremely foolish would be to try to lean against this oil price fall today,\u201d Carney said. \u201cThe impact of that extra stimulus \u2026 would happen well after the oil price fall had moved through the economy and we would just add unnecessary volatility.\u201d Ian McCafferty, one of the externally appointed members of the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee \u2013 the nine-strong body that sets interest rates \u2013 said the Bank should \u201clook through\u201d a temporary fall in inflation caused by cheaper oil. Speaking in Durham, McCafferty said he believed there was less slack in the UK labour market than the MPC\u2019s collective judgment would suggest. While the threat of deflation needed to be taken seriously, he added that there was no current evidence of a deflationary psychology setting in.",

      "bodyText": "Asda\u2019s sales performance has sunk to its worst in more than 20 years in the face of a resurgence by its larger rival Tesco and a bitter supermarket price war. Sales dropped at all three of Tesco\u2019s major rivals as Britain\u2019s biggest retailer increased sales by 1.1% in the 12 weeks to 1 March, according to the latest data from Kantar Worldpanel. It was Tesco\u2019s best result for 18 months. Asda was the worst performer of the big four. The Walmart-owned chain\u2019s sales slid by 2.1% over the period, a further deterioration on the 1.9% decline recorded for the 12 weeks to 1 February, and its worst performance since Kantar began its records in 1994. In February the retailer blamed heavy use of discount vouchers by its rivals for a difficult year in which underlying sales fell by 1%, its first annual decline since 2008. At the beginning of last year, the supermarket benefited from early action to cut prices, making it much cheaper than Tesco and its other major rivals, but all three have now taken action to narrow the gap. Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar, said: \u201cAsda is really being caught in the crossfire of Tesco\u2019s mini-resurgence. There is not room for all of the big four to grow and so when Tesco\u2019s sales rise the others suffer. \u201cThis resurgence has impacted on Asda which competes for many of the same shoppers as Tesco,\u201d he said. He said 85% of Asda\u2019s customers also shopped at Tesco and it was losing sales to the discounters Aldi and Lidl. Sales at Sainsbury\u2019s and Morrisons slipped back by 0.5% and 0.4% respectively as grocery market deflation hit a new record of 1.6%. The prices of staples such as eggs, vegetables and milk are all falling in a price war fuelled by the rise of the discount chains, global commodity deflation and the reluctance of consumers to splash out on food. The Kantar data reflect figures from the British Retail Consortium and KPMG, which showed that food sales fell by 1.6% in the three months to February. All of the big four lost market share as the German chains Aldi and Lidl continued their rapid growth. Aldi\u2019s sales rose by 19.3% over the three months, taking its market share to 5%, while Lidl\u2019s sales rose by 13.6% for a 3.5% share. However, both chains\u2019 growth continued to slow, continuing a trend over the past year. Analysts said Aldi had seen a particularly rapid decline recently so that in the four weeks to 1 March, Lidl\u2019s sales rose faster than its bigger rival for the first time since 2011. \u201cThere\u2019s been quite a swing around,\u201d said Richard Clarke, an analyst at Bernstein Research. He said it appeared that Lidl\u2019s attempts to win over more affluent shoppers with better service and more luxury goods was gaining it more sales than Aldi\u2019s more price-orientated tactics. The latest signs of a recovery at Tesco are good news for the retailer\u2019s new boss, Dave Lewis, who has been improving customer service and product availability as well as cutting prices in an attempt to turn around the decline in sales and profits. Clarke said Tesco\u2019s sales growth was likely to continue to improve over the next few months as the comparative figures from last year were weak. McKevitt said Tesco\u2019s \u201cprice perception\u201d was improving but it was continuing to lose market share. The retailer now controls 28.7% of grocery sales, 0.1% less than a year ago. Louise Cooper, an independent analyst, said: \u201cThere are some that are heralding this as the beginning of Tesco\u2019s recovery. I would still remain cautious. The juggernaut that is the UK\u2019s biggest retailer is beginning to steer the right course, but it has a long way to go yet.\u201d Asda remains the UK\u2019s second-largest grocer with 17% market share followed by Sainsbury\u2019s on 16.8% and Morrisons on 11%. Morrisons, where former Tesco executive David Potts will start work as chief executive next week, is set to reveal its latest sales figures on Thursday.",

    "webTitle": "Prudential shares fall but Credit Suisse gains after Thiam announces move to bank", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Prudential shares have dipped after the UK insurer confirmed that its boss, Tidjane Thiam, was quitting to take over at the top of banking group Credit Suisse. Prudential stock fell 3% after the FTSE-100 insurer said Thiam\u2019s stint of more than five years as chief executive would end after its annual meeting in May. By contrast shares in Credit Suisse rose 6.7% as the appointment was welcomed by the struggling lender\u2019s investors. Thiam is credited with turning Prudential into Britain\u2019s most successful insurance company by overseeing rapid growth in Asia and the US. At Credit Suisse his job will be to turn around a company criticised for responding too slowly to the new, tougher realities of banking since the financial crisis. Prudential\u2019s share price has tripled since Thiam took over in October 2009, while Credit Suisse\u2019s shares have more than halved over the same period. Matthew Preston, an insurance analyst at Berenberg Bank, said: \u201cOver the last five or six years, Prudential has done very well and Credit Suisse has done not so well and people are hoping Tidjane can bring some of that to Credit Suisse. \u201cPeople are probably a bit sad that Tidjane is moving on but there is nothing fundamentally wrong with Prudential\u2019s business,\u201d he said. Thiam\u2019s decision to leave Prudential means the FTSE 100 will lose its first and only black chief executive, a status he has played down, at a time when the government wants to see more women and ethnic minorities at the top of companies. The blow of Thiam\u2019s departure was cushioned by a strong set of results at Prudential. Operating profit for the year ending 31 December 2014 rose 14% to \u00a33.2bn and the group increased its annual dividend by a bigger-than-expected 10% to 36.93p a share. Prudential shares ended the day down 2% Operating profit in Asia increased 16% to \u00a31.05bn, while profit at Prudential\u2019s Jackson National subsidiary in the US jumped 21% to \u00a31.4bn. Prudential shares ended the day down 3% at \u00a316.12 while Criedt Suisse climbed nearly 8% to 25 Swiss Francs. Thiam is highly regarded despite a sometimes bumpy reign at Prudential. His handling of the failed bid for the Asian life assurance arm of AIG in 2010 prompted calls for him to quit and brought personal censure from the City regulator three years later. Thiam said. \u201cI\u2019m really pleased to be able to step down at a time when everything is going well. It\u2019s a rare privilege for a CEO and I\u2019m very fortunate.\u201d Prudential\u2019s chairman, Paul Manduca, said the board understood Thiam\u2019s \u201cdesire to take on a new challenge with another global leader in a different part of the financial services sector\u201d. Manduca said Prudential had prepared for Thiam\u2019s possible departure and had used a headhunter to assess external and internal candidates. \u201cWe hope we will be in a position to announce a new CEO very shortly,\u201d he said. Mike Wells, the head of Prudential\u2019s US operations, is regarded as the leading candidate. Credit Suisse said its present boss, Brady Dougan, would leave at the end of June. Dougan became chief executive of Credit Suisse in 2007 and steered the bank through the financial crisis. However, his position came under pressure last year when Credit Suisse pleaded guilty to charges that it helped American citizens evade taxes, becoming the first bank in more than a decade to admit to a crime in the US. Credit Suisse agreed to pay $2.6bn (\u00a31.7bn) as part of the settlement, as Dougan blamed the scandal on a small number of Switzerland-based bankers who \u201cskirted the bank\u2019s controls\u201d. Thiam will have to make decisions about Credit Suisse\u2019s presence in investment banking \u2013 a business in which its Swiss rival UBS has scaled back sharply \u2013 and will face a $10bn lawsuit over the sale of mortgage-backed securities before the financial crisis. A City fund manager said: \u201cHe has been around long enough to understand what he\u2019s getting himself into and what is needed to change the culture in an organisation, which is what is needed at investment banks. A lot of the issues are to do with dealing with regulators and politicians as well as running the business.\u201d Thiam has been courted by politicians and has extensive contacts outside business. He served on the former British prime minister Tony Blair\u2019s Commission for Africa and picked up a L\u00e9gion d\u2019honneur, the equivalent of a knighthood, from the French government.",

      "bodyText": "FirstGroup is bidding to run competing trains on the east coast mainline, barely a week after its rival Virgin Trains started operating the franchise on that route. First has submitted plans to the rail regulator for a low-fare, open-access service, which it claims would compete with the budget airline market between London, Newcastle and Edinburgh \u2013 although Stagecoach, which operates Virgin Trains East Coast, said First\u2019s plans were \u201cnot compatible\u201d with its own. The five trains a day in each direction would make additional stops at Stevenage, which is close to two London airports, and Morpeth, which is near Newcastle airport \u2013 and have just economy-class travel. First, which lost out to the 90% Stagecoach-owned Virgin Trains joint-venture to run the east coast franchise, hopes the Office of Rail Regulation (ORR) will approve its plans by May for a 2018 start. Leo Goodwin, First\u2019s commercial development director, said: \u201cWe\u2019ve identified that there is a very specific niche market between London and Edinburgh, contested particularly by budget airlines. At the heart of our product proposition is a single class of travel: by serving a very simple network, with a simplified business and an efficient train, our business model is based on fares that are significantly lower than those on offer today across the travel options, including air.\u201d FirstGroup operates another similar open-access service on the route, Hull Trains, which has consistently been rated highly in passenger surveys. Open-access plans need to demonstrate to the regulator that they will expand the overall rail market. First said it would introduce new intercity trains. Tim O\u2019Toole, First Group\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cOpen-access operators can really add value and create passenger loyalty by serving niche markets. We have put our compelling case to the ORR and we are looking forward to hearing the outcome of our application.\u201d A spokesman for the Stagecoach-Virgin consortium said its franchise programme already included plans to cut journey times between London and Edinburgh to four hours. \u201cWhile limited open-access competition is possible, we don\u2019t believe what has been proposed would be compatible with our timetable proposals, which will deliver extra and new direct services to London from key locations in Scotland and England and more weekend services,\u201d he said. He added that its winning franchise bid had taken account of potential new open-access operations, and dismissed First\u2019s proposals as \u201ca scaled-down version of similar plans already published by another open-access operator\u201d. He said Virgin Trains\u2019 contract would protect it against most revenue loss incurred.",

We have put our compelling case to the ORR and we are looking forward to hearing the outcome of our application.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesman for the Stagecoach-Virgin consortium said its franchise programme already included plans to cut journey times between London and Edinburgh to four hours.</p> <p> \u201cWhile limited open-access competition is possible, we don\u2019t believe what has been proposed would be compatible with our timetable proposals, which will deliver extra and new direct services to London from key locations in Scotland and England and more weekend services,\u201d he said.</p> <p> He added that its winning franchise bid had taken account of potential new open-access operations, and dismissed First\u2019s proposals as \u201ca scaled-down version of similar plans already published by another open-access operator\u201d. </p> <p>He said Virgin Trains\u2019 contract would protect it against most revenue loss incurred.<br tabindex=\"-1\"><br tabindex=\"-1\"></p>",

      "bodyText": "Before closing the blog for today, here is a closing summary of the main events today. EU finance ministers met in Brussels for an ecofin meeting For once, Greece was not top of the agenda in Brussels, but there was no escaping the subject Germany\u2019s Wolfgang was unwavering in his tough stance on Athens Eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem warned markets might lose faith in Greece George Osborne said \u201cthis Greek drama isn\u2019t over\u201d Markets across Europe and the US were down The euro hit a near 12-year low against the dollar Italian industrial production fell unexpectedly; French industrial production rose unexpectedly Greek deflation slowed in February, with consumer inflation at -2.2% Bank of England governor Mark Carney was up in front of the House of Lords Economic Affairs Committee Prudential chief executive Tidjane Thiam resigns to lead Credit Suisse Thank you for reading the blog today and for all your comments. We\u2019ll be back again tomorrow, when there should be developments in Greece as it tries to hammer out an agreement on reforms with its creditors. Please join us then. AM Back in Athens, the Greek government has announced \u20ac50 million of savings achieved from cutting ministerial advisers \u201cand other privileges.\u201d The Guardian\u2019s Helena Smith reports: One official explained: \u201cThe government is putting an end to the hiring of unnecessary advisers who very often were used for the purpose of patronage politics. At a time when Greek society has experienced such a hard policy of austerity, it was provocative to allow a regime of tens of advisers to continue.\u201d The finance minister Yanis Varoufakis also says he has scaled back on advisers dramatically - along with ministerial cars and guards seconded to protect him from the police force. The leftist-led administration said the \u20ac50 million would go towards relief measures aimed at alleviating the humanitarian crisis that has hit poorer Greeks as a result of relentless cutbacks and recession. \u201cIn this way we are supporting weaker strata of society while at the same contributing to the restoration of a sense of justice,\u201d the official added. In the UK, Bank of England governor Mark Carney is appearing in front of the House of Lords Economic Affairs Committee. Here are some of the main points he\u2019s made so far: UK inflation is likely to remain close to zero for much of 2015 Global risks remain considerable UK housing market is biggest medium-term risk to financial stability Bank of England should be held to the highest standards and learn lessons when it falls short Interest rate rises will be gradual and limited It would be foolish to consider more UK stimulus at this time to boost inflation (which is at just 0.3%) Quantitative easing is more effective in \u201cdislocated\u201d markets that are under strain, rather than in more normal times The session can be watched live (and played back) here. Interesting times at the Bank, after last week\u2019s shock revelation that the Bank is at the centre of a Serious Fraud Office investigation. Read the full story on that here. Jeroen Dijsselbloem has issued a fresh warning on Greece following the meeting of EU finance ministers in Brussels. The Greek situation was not on the agenda at today\u2019s Ecofin meeting, but it was impossible for ministers to escape the subject while agreement on Greek reforms has yet to be reached. Dijsselbloem, eurogroup president and Dutch finance minister, said the markets will lose confidence in Greece if it doesn\u2019t come up with acceptable reforms proposals. Reuters snaps: 10-Mar-2015 14:21 - EUROGROUP\u2019S DIJSSELBLOEM: IF GREECE DOESN\u2019T ACT ON REFORMS, MARKETS WILL LOSE CONFIDENCE 10-Mar-2015 14:23 - EUROGROUP\u2019S DIJSSELBLOEM: GREECE WON\u2019T RECEIVE MONEY UNLESS IT MAKES EFFORT The price of copper has fallen amid concerns over China. Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange fell 1.9% to $5,756 a tonne, following the publication of Chinese inflation data and a strengthening dollar. Annual consumer inflation in China picked up in February to 1.4% from a five-year low of 0.8% in January. Economists polled by Reuters were expecting a smaller rebound in prices last month, with inflation at 0.9%. However, producer prices fell by 4.8% on an annual basis, following a 4.3% fall in January. It was the fastest rate of factory price deflation in almost five-and-a-half years, reminding investors of the slowdown in China\u2019s economy. US markets have opened lower as fears over lack of progress in Greece persist. Dow Jones: -1% at 17,809.39 S&amp;P 500: -0.9% at 2,061.34 Nasdaq: -1% at 4,368.43 The US has little direct exposure to Greece but investors are concerned that the longer the uncertainty carries on, the bigger the negative impact will be on the eurozone economy. Nicholas Colas, chief market strategist at the ConvergEx Group in New York: There\u2019s a lot of rhetoric out there, some of which feels like name-calling, all of which makes the situation read as worse than it used to be. UK chancellor George Osborne has reported back from the Ecofin meeting in Brussels. He\u2019s been urging Yanis Varoufakis, the Greek finance minister, to hurry up and agree reforms with the rest of the eurozone. Helena Smith, the Guardian\u2019s correspondent in Athens, brings us this report on the situation in Greece: Over in Greece local media are making much of revelations that Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis was strong-armed into allowing inspectors representing the deeply unpopular troika to return to Athens. Greek officials are keeping mum but EU sources in Brussels have revealed in no uncertain terms that Athens was posed with an ultimatum: either it allowed auditors to examine its books, in situ, or emergency funds would be stopped. The ultimatum was made by no less than ECB president Mario Draghi, according to officials cited in a Bloomberg report. Greece is fast approaching the day of reckoning with room for manoeuvre becoming ever narrower as it races against the clock - and a mountain of maturing debt repayments - to avoid a credit crunch. Athens must repay \u20ac300 million to the IMF by the end of the week. Economists are saying the situation is becoming desperate. Liquidity fears are such that the leftist-led government has reportedly beseeched the Greek subsidiaries of multinational firms for short-term loans. The General Accounting office, it was revealed today, has also stopped payments on any state expenditure not related to pensions or salaries - and fears are growing of an \u201cinternal default\u201d which could see the government making reduced payments to pensioners and public employees. Germany\u2019s finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble has yet to be won over by Yanis Varoufakis, his counterpart in Greece. Speaking frankly (as usual) at the Econfin meeting in Brussels on Tuesday, Schaeuble said Varoufakis was the only person in the eurogroup (eurozone finance ministers) to believe that no time has been wasted on hammering out Greek reforms. He added: Greece must talk to the institutions to ensure that the memorandum of understanding (agreed with its creditors) is fulfilled. Only when this condition has been met is there a possibility for payment to be made from the programme. Markets found no cheer from the latest data to come out of Italy, which showed a surprise fall in industrial production in January. Production fell 0.7% over the month, dampening hopes of a recovery from recession. Economists polled by Reuters had predicted a 0.2% rise. It was the first drop in industrial production since September. In Italy production tends to show a strong correlation with GDP, which was flat in the fourth quarter of 2014. The Italian economy is mired in a three-year recession, with industrial production down by almost a quarter since its 2008 peak. The picture for production looked slightly better over a three-month period, up 0.1% according to Italy\u2019s statistics agency, ISTAT. The figures were at odds with the equivalent numbers out of France this morning. French industrial production grew by o.4% in January, beating expectations of a 0.3% fall. This reaction from Jennifer McKeown, senior European economist at Capital Economics: January\u2019s French industrial data support the message from the German and Spanish releases that activity was expanding slowly at the start of the year. But the fall in Italian production suggests that the three-year recession there has continued. Today\u2019s data, together with earlier figures from Germany and Spain, suggest that Thursday\u2019s eurozone release will show that industrial production stagnated in January. So despite signs of improvement in some of the business surveys, there is little hard evidence to suggest that the slow recovery in the region is gaining pace. Investors across Europe are feeling less optimistic than they were earlier this morning. Fears over Greece\u2019s future are creeping back in. FTSE 100: -1.2% at 6,793.5 Germany\u2019s DAX: -0.7% at 11,495.61 France\u2019s CAC: -0.7% at 4,901.52 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: -0.9% at 22,370 Spain\u2019s IBEX: -1.1% at 10,933.2 The FTSE fall is being led lower by the oil and energy companies, tracking falls in commodities. Brent crude oil is down 1.3% at $57.75 a barrel. Shares in Prudential are still down more than 2% after the insurer announced the resignation of its chief executive Tidjane Thiam. Time for a European holiday? The euro has edged closer towards parity with the dollar, dropping to $1.076. It\u2019s the first time below $1.08 since September 2003 as the two central banks in question take opposite positions on monetary policy. While the European Central Bank is just kickstarting its QE programme, pumping more than \u20ac1 trillion into the eurozone economy, the US Federal Reserve is getting ready to tighten policy with an interest rate hike on the cards. The pace of price falls in Greece slowed in February, with annual consumer inflation of -2.2% compared with 2.8% in January according to the nation\u2019s statistics office. The deflation rate also decelerated on an EU-harmonised basis, with prices falling by 1.9% in February - not as much as the 2.6% drop forecast by economists in a Reuters poll. Greece has now been in deflation for two years as wage cuts, austerity and the country\u2019s financial crisis take their toll. The European Central Bank has pressed the button on a \u20ac1.1 trillion programme of sovereign bond purchases in a bid to ward of a wider deflationary spiral in the eurozone. Annual inflation in the single currency bloc was -0.3% in February, up from -0.6% in January. The ECB is hoping that its quantitative easing programme will help to push inflation back into positive territory. Ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s says a Greek exit from the euro probably wouldn\u2019t be a major deal for foreign banks, with ratings downgrades unlikely. In a report called This Time, Foreign Banks Have Less To Fear About A Grexit, S&amp;P argues: Given the relatively limited scale of banks\u2019 exposures to Greece, we do not currently expect that a Grexit would, in and of itself, lead to ratings changes for foreign banks, or that exposed foreign banks would require additional capital support. We consider the direct impact on foreign banks from a Grexit or from continuing uncertainty about it as limited because they have relatively limited direct exposure to Greek banks or to Greece\u2019s public and private sector, having significantly reduced their lending since the restructuring of Greek government debt in 2012. According to the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), foreign banks\u2019 direct exposures against Greek entities amounted to $46 billion (\u00a330.5 billion) as of September 2014, with further potential exposures in the form of derivatives, guarantees, and commitments amounting to $22.8 billion. Those levels are markedly lower than recent highs of $138 billion in early 2011. Banks in three countries account for over 80% of total foreign banks\u2019 direct Greek exposures as of September 2014: Germany ($13.5 billion), the UK. ($13.5 billion), and the US ($10.6 billion). However, these amounts represent a very small proportion of each country\u2019s total banking sector foreign direct exposures, at 0.56% for Germany, 0.36% for the UK, and 0.34% for the US. Greek investors are not letting a lack of agreed reforms get in the way of some spring cheer. The ATG index in Athens is up almost 3% at 837.27 this morning. The banks are among the top risers. Judging by the smiles, there appears to be a fair amount of cheer in Brussels this morning, despite the lack of progress made on Greece at yesterday\u2019s meeting of eurozone finance ministers. The meeting might offer Greek finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, brief respite from the spotlight. Ministers at the Ecofin meeting are planning to focus their attention on other, EU-wide, issues today. Greek reform proposals presented by Varoufakis were rejected yesterday by euro finance minister as inadequate and generally a bit vague. Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Dutch finance minister and eurogroup president, expressed frustration yesterday at the lack of progress so far. We have spent the last two weeks discussing who will meet who, where and in what configuration. It\u2019s been a complete waste of time. He then confirmed that the three institutions behind Greece\u2019s bailout - the European commission, the International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank \u2013 will hold \u201ctechnical talks\u201d on the Greek proposals on Wednesday. Finance ministers from across the European Union have arrived for the Ecofin meeting in Brussels. Top of the agenda is the implementation of a banking union, as well as a European fund for strategic investments. The UK\u2019s chancellor, George Osborne, is attending Ecofin today. He has been accused of using the meeting as an excuse to dodge Treasury questions, where shadow chancellor Ed Balls was planning to quiz him on Conservative plans for spending cuts. Figures published earlier showed a surprise rise in French industrial production. Production increased 0.4% in January, beating expectations of 0.3% fall. It followed a 1.4% increase in December. Elsewhere in Europe, investors appear a little underwhelmed this morning as they consider the inconclusive outcome from yesterday\u2019s eurogroup meeting on Greece and What It All Means. German DAX: -0.1 at 11,574.17 France\u2019s CAC 40: +0.1% at 4,940.38 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: -0.1 at 22,550.73 Spain\u2019s IBEX: +0.2% at 11,072.5 The Pru has yet to announce a replacement for Thiam, but chairman Paul Manduca said a successor has been identified and will be announced \u201conce the regulatory approval process has been completed\u201d. Lots of speculation that Mike Wells, the head of the Pru\u2019s US business, is the chosen one. The FTSE 100 has opened slightly lower, down 0.2% at 6,863.41. Pru shares are down more than 3% at \u00a316.09 on the news that its respected chief executive, Tidjane Thiam, is leaving to lead Credit Suisse. More on the Pru\u2019s announcement this morning. Paul Manduca, the insurer\u2019s chairman, piled on the praise for Thiam: Tidjane has been one of the most exceptional leaders in Prudential\u2019s long and illustrious history. From leading the group through the financial crisis at the end of the last decade, first as CFO and then as CEO, to shaping an Asia-focused strategy that has seen Prudential grow into an ever more successful UK-based financial services business, he has been a great servant to the company and all its stakeholders in his seven years on our board. Although the Board will be sorry to see him go, we understand his desire to take on a new challenge with another global leader in a different part of the financial services sector, headquartered in Switzerland, and we wish him every success in his new role. On a call with journalists this morning , Thiam said he was leaving on a high. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Prudential has issued a statement this morning confirming the departure of its chief executive Tidjane Thiam. The statement follows press reports overnight (read our story here). Thiam is leaving to become chief executive of Credit Suisse, replacing Brady Dougan at the bank. Thiam decisions at the Pru have been controversial at times, but the insurer\u2019s share price has been tripled since he became chief executive in October 2009 as he built the company\u2019s position in Asia. It will be interesting to see how investors react to the news when markets open. In 2010, Thiam survived a failed $35.5bn (\u00a323.5bn) takeover bid for the Asian life assurance division of AIG in 2010. Thiam is hosting a call with journalists, more on that soon. Also today: We will be bringing you all the latest on Greece, following yesterday\u2019s stalemate at the latest eurogroup meeting. Greece has been told to go away and do more work on its proposed reforms. Our full report from Brussels is here An Ecofin meeting of EU finance ministers is taking place today. We will bring you any updates Industrial production figures from Italy and France A look ahead to Wednesday\u2019s meeting between Greece and its creditors",

Those levels are markedly lower than recent highs of $138 billion in early 2011. </p> <p>Banks in three countries account for over 80% of total foreign banks\u2019 direct Greek exposures as of September 2014: Germany ($13.5 billion), the UK.

      "bodyText": "Itchy feet seems to be one reason why Tidjane Thiam decided to quit the Prudential, the UK\u2019s 11th largest public company. Fair enough. Over five years as chief executive counts as a decent innings these days and the Pru seems to be set up nicely for a few more years of success. Even so, why he does he want to join Credit Suisse? Why a bank? Why Switzerland? The pay will be excellent, of course, but isn\u2019t hanging out with the gnomes of Zurich a bit, well, 20th century? Isn\u2019t big banking in the 21st century an unexciting grind of shedding investment bankers and keeping regulators sweet? The answer, which will depress some, is that bulge-bracket banks still carry allure, even in the post-crisis world. Within the financial services industry, insurers have the air of second-class status. In footballing terms \u2013 and Thiam is an Arsenal fan \u2013 it\u2019s the difference between winning the FA Cup and playing in the Champions League. Or, at least, that\u2019s how the globe-trotting chief executive class tends to see life: in the prestige stakes, banks still win. Assuming Thiam is successful in Zurich, he\u2019ll emerge in another five years as one of the few people to have led a big insurer and a big bank. If he then wants to join a body like the International Monetary Fund \u2013 which some assume to be his eventual career path \u2013 he will be well positioned. He is 52, so has time on his side. Prudential\u2019s shares fell and Credit Suisse\u2019s rose as the transfer was announced, which shows what investors think. Pru\u2019s lot weren\u2019t always so admiring. They killed the $35bn bid for Asian rival AIA in 2010, regarding the deal as too pricey. At the time, their judgment seemed reasonable but Thiam could point out that AIA has since doubled in value. Pru\u2019s share price has done even better on his watch. It has trebled, leaving his former employer Aviva in the shade. Sceptics say fast-growing insurers always encounter a crisis in the end because it\u2019s impossible to keep customers, regulators and shareholders perpetually happy. There is no sign currently of the Pru falling into that trap \u2013 operating profits for 2014 were up 14% to \u00a33.2bn \u2013 but there is a sense that Asia is about to slow down sharply. If you were minded to go, there\u2019s another reason to do so now. Currency affairs Large and sudden currency moves can be dangerous. When the currency is the US dollar the risks are magnified and, right now, the dollar is rising against everything. The euro\u2019s slump to a 12-year low is just part of the story. The Brazilian real has fallen almost 15% against the dollar since the start of the year, illustrating some of the pain in emerging markets. For the US Federal Reserve, the immediate problem is whether to go ahead with a rise in rates in the middle of this year, which is the market\u2019s current expectation given officials\u2019 bullish noises about the rate at which the US economy is creating jobs. The trouble is, the dollar\u2019s rise is already delivering tighter monetary conditions in the US. A 10% movement against the euro since January makes US exports less competitive. Meanwhile, the US employment figures may not be giving the full story. The retail sales data has been surprisingly weak given the plunge in the oil price. It may be that a rate hike is the last thing the US economy needs this summer. But the really big danger lies on the other side of the world in China. If the likes of Brazil, South Africa and Turkey are struggling to live with a surging US dollar, China won\u2019t like current conditions either. The ultimate get-out for Beijing would be to allow the renminbi to devalue, a move that would cause a political storm in the US. Sporadic currency wars have been part of the post-crisis financial landscape. If the dollar\u2019s run goes much further, prepare for an intensification. A tough day for most, but not Aldermore It turned out to be rotten day for a stock market flotation. Never mind, Aldermore, one of the new breed of \u201cchallenger\u201d banks, climbed 11.5% above its 192p listing price. One can understand the appeal. Return on equity was an impressive 15% last year; there are no legacy issues, like PPI compensation claims; and Aldermore\u2019s management thinks it can reduce the cost-to-income rate to below 40% by the end of 2017, an efficiency level to cause envy among the old banking guard. All the same, Aldermore is now valued at 1.6 times book value, making it possibly the most expensive UK-listed bank. That\u2019s a challenging rating.",

The long-serving former Liberal treasurer also said the Coalition had conflicting economic messages and dismissed treasurer Joe Hockey\u2019s recent suggestion that homebuyers be allowed to access their super. But he praised the government for attempting to use the long-term focus of the intergenerational report (IGR) to \u201creset\u201d the economic debate. \u201cI think there\u2019s a bit of a conflicting narrative there,\u201d Costello said of the IGR, released last week, in an interview on the ABC\u2019s 7.30 report. He cited Hockey\u2019s claim that the long-term ramifications of doing no more than currently legislated policy would knock Australians off their chairs and then said, \u201con the other hand he [Hockey] wants to tell us that if [the government\u2019s] budget measures passed then the budget goes into surplus in 2020 and we enjoy uninterrupted surpluses for 35 years\u201d. \u201cNow, I wish it would happen, I really, really wish it would happen \u2013 uninterrupted surpluses for 35 years. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be as easy as that. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to look behind an IGR and you\u2019ve got to look at its assumptions.

The case is ongoing. Because of these risks, the EAC said \u201ca compelling case for the inclusion of an ISDS in TTIP has not yet been made\u201d. The report also found that any attempt to align EU environmental safeguards with those in the US, which are generally seen to be weaker, could result in a \u201crace to the bottom\u201d in which protection was watered down to the lowest common denominator. The MPs also noted that the lack of transparency surrounding the negotiations, which are being conducted in secret, made it impossible to monitor whether environmental risks were being taken into consideration. \u201cThe focus in TTIP has been on its potential for boosting transatlantic trade, but that must not be at the expense of throwing away hard-won environmental and public health protections,\u201d said Walley. A government spokesman said: \u201cThe UK government and European Commission have both been clear that the environmental and food safety standards we enjoy on this side of the Atlantic are not up for negotiation. The \u2018precautionary principle\u2019 highlighted by the committee\u2019s report is legally enshrined in the Lisbon treaty and TTIP will not change that. \u201cWe agree with the committee that we must retain the right to regulate, and the EU chief negotiator has already made clear there can be no compromise on this.\u201d",

A pick-up in sales of swimwear, sandals and other holiday items was barely enough to offset the continuing decline in food sales and that left like-for-like sales up just 0.2% on February 2014, matching January\u2019s lacklustre growth. Sales were up 1.7% on a total basis, which does not adjust for the effect of new store openings, according to the latest British Retail Consortium-KPMG retail sales monitor. The industry group said there was some help from Valentine\u2019s day-related sales including jewellery and beauty products. There was also a boost from furniture. But, extending a pattern seen throughout last year, food sales continued to fall in the latest three months on a like-for-like basis. \u201cActivity on the high street has settled into a monotonous equilibrium, with falling like-for-like food sales persistently wiping out any meaningful like-for-like growth the non-food sector manages to achieve. February\u2019s figures are also against very weak comparables, when bad weather caused sales to stall last year,\u201d said David McCorquodale, head of retail at the report\u2019s co-authors, the consultancy KPMG. Food sales fell an annual 1.6% in the three months to February while non-food sales rose 1.2%. That left both categories taken together down 0.1% in like-for-like terms, the weakest underlying performance for three months. McCorquodale said the wider economic recovery appeared to be \u201cbypassing the retail sector. With interest rates and inflation remaining low, it\u2019s surprising more consumers aren\u2019t treating themselves to a new pair of shoes, or curtains for the home. One suspects that restaurateurs, not retailers, are benefitting from the extra cash in consumers\u2019 pockets resulting from fuel price savings,\u201d he said. BRC sought to highlight the growth in total sales and the boost to consumers from continued discounting. Director general Helen Dickinson said: \u201cAfter the bustle of Christmas and the excitement of the January sales, February is usually a quiet month for retailers. So it\u2019s heartening to see that retail sales continued to rise this month by close to 2% \u2026 Sales are up while prices fall, which means that retailers are continuing to work hard to provide original products that excite customers at the right price.\u201d",
