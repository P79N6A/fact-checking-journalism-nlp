All confectionery, chocolate and sweets will be removed from stands at Aldi's checkouts and replaced with healthier options including dried fruit, nuts, juices and water. The move follows a 16-week trial in a selected number of Aldi's 500 UK stores which ran from February to June this year. Giles Hurley, joint managing director of corporate buying at the supermarket, said: \"The healthier tills trial quickly showed that healthier foods prove more popular with our shoppers than the traditional checkout offer of confectionery and sweets.\" The UK's largest retailer, Tesco, announced in May that it was to ban sweets and chocolates from its checkouts after a survey of customers showed overwhelming support for the move. In January, Aldi's German discount competitor, Lidl, banned confectionery from the checkout at all 600 of its British stores after a survey of parents' views. It replaced racks of sweets at the tills with dried and fresh fruit, oatcakes and juices. Richard Lloyd, executive director of the consumer group Which?, said: \"It is welcome news that Aldi is promoting healthier tills across all of its stores. We want all retailers to ensure that product positioning, particularly at the checkout, helps people to make healthier choices.\"",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Hewlett-Packard has revealed it plans to sue the UK arm of Deloitte, auditor of the Cambridge software firm Autonomy that HP bought for $11bn (\u00a36.6bn) before writing off nearly half the company's value and accusing the former management of accounting improprieties. The latest threat came as a San Francisco judge shot down HP's $48m settlement with two law firms which had been pursuing HP directors over the affair on behalf of disgruntled shareholders. HP instead had persuaded the firms to drop the class action and join it in pursuing Autonomy's former management. HP bought Autonomy in 2011 but the following year wrote down its value by $5bn, blaming \"accounting improprieties, misrepresentation and disclosure failures\" by its former management. The Californian laptops, printers, servers and software group's shares crashed after the announcement. HP has repeatedly threatened court action against Autonomy founder Mike Lynch and his finance director Sushovan Hussain. On Monday, during the hearing over HP's settlement with shareholders, the company's lawyer Marc Wolinsky disclosed that HP also planned to sue Deloitte over its auditing of the Autonomy accounts. An HP spokesperson said: \"We will continue to work to have the derivative actions settled or dismissed and to hold the former executives of Autonomy as well as Autonomy's auditor, Deloitte UK, responsible for the wrongdoing that occurred.\" Deloitte signed off Autonomy's accounts in 2009 and 2010, a period during which HP claims to have found a number of irregularities. HP claims that more than $200m of Autonomy's $1bn revenues in 2010 were questionable. A spokesperson for Deloitte UK countered: \"Any possible claim would be utterly without merit and we will defend ourselves strongly against it. Deloitte was not engaged by HP, or by Autonomy, to provide any due diligence in relation to the acquisition of Autonomy. Deloitte UK was auditor to Autonomy at the time of its acquisition by HP. Deloitte UK conducted its audit work in full compliance with regulation and professional standards.\" This week the Guardian revealed Deloitte was aware of the details of three transactions which HP says cast doubt over Autonomy's dealings with resellers \u2013 companies selling its software on to end users. Kraft, Eli Lilly and KMPG were named as end users of Autonomy software in multimillion-dollar deals with resellers, sales which helped boost Autonomy's quarterly revenues. All three deals were subsequently restructured, with one reseller paid $400,000 in compensation fees. Lynch and Hussain deny all allegations of wrongdoing and blame the writedown in their company's value on bad management by HP. The HP allegations have prompted an investigation by the US Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, as well as the UK's Serious Fraud Office. At the San Francisco hearing, called to give preliminary approval to HP's settlement of shareholder class actions, US district judge Charles Breyer rejected the fees attorneys would have recouped under the settlement. \"That's out,\" he said. HP had promised Cotchett, Pitre &amp; McCarthly and Robbins Geller Rudman &amp; Dowd $18m in over 32 months, so long as they switched their efforts to pursuing Lynch and Hussain. Should legal action against the former Autonomy managers be successful, the firms could win a further maximum of $30m. It is understood both firms have already agreed to sign the settlement without the promise of fees. A number of parties objected to the shareholder settlement, including Hussain. In court on Monday, Hussain's attorney John Keker called the deal a \"whitewash\". \"This is a joke,\" Keker said. \"If it were a carcass, animals would walk around it, it stinks so much.\" Marc Wolinsky, HP's lawyer, said HP would vigorously contest Hussain's ability to review documents. Breyer has scheduled a hearing for 26 September. The judge said he would need to weigh the evidence against HP officers as part of his analysis on whether the deal absolving them of liability is fair for shareholders. \"Something went terribly wrong,\" Breyer said of the Autonomy acquisition.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Wall Street\u2019s dealmakers called Barack Obama\u2019s bluff on Tuesday with the acquisition by Burger King of a Canadian coffee chain, which could embolden other multinationals looking for similar tax savings to move their headquarters abroad. Though faced with vocal opposition from the White House to the process known as tax inversions, the bankers and lawyers advising Burger King will have known that the president has a weak hand: without binding legislation from Congress to close the underlying tax loophole that allows such deals, the president had limited options beyond naming and shaming those who exploit it. Until now, this threat of moral opprobrium in Washington and theoretical risk of future legislation that might require reversing the transaction have been enough to deter several previous attempts. Drug store chain Walgreens abandoned similar plans to move its US headquarters to Europe when it bought the remainder of Alliance Boots. Pfizer had been examining a similar move as part of its initially-rebuffed approach to AstraZeneca. But with many multinationals accumulating growing piles of cash in overseas subsidiaries that they are reluctant to repatriate to high tax jurisdictions like the US, there is growing pressure to structure mergers in ways that allow the whole corporate entity to move to a cheaper location. That the Burger King and Tim Hortons deal was partially funded by Warren Buffett, a billionaire previously noted for criticising the low tax rates enjoyed by the very rich, only served to underscore a view on Wall Street that it is up to lawmakers to change the law if they don\u2019t like its consequences. Such arrangements have already proven popular elsewhere this year. Among proposed US cross-border mergers, nearly two-thirds are being done for the tax benefit, according to data from Thomson Reuters. Tax inversions, newly popularized by the law firm Skadden Arps Meagher &amp; Flom four years ago, have taken on a new popularity this year as many corporations struggle to appease shareholders looking askance at growing corporate cash piles. While corporate cash piles act as a bulwark during recessionary times, the recovering economy has made the multibillion-dollar cash hoards look like bad financial management. Many US corporations have complained loudly about US tax rates, even though it\u2019s rare that they pay the full burden of 35% to 39%. Out of the Fortune 500 of prominent US companies, 288 paid an effective US federal tax rate of just 19.4% between 2008 and 2012, according to advocacy group Citizens for Tax Justice. The conflict really centres around the profits that US companies generate overseas. These foreign profits have flooded the coffers of US companies, making up the bulk of an estimated $1.5 trillion in excess cash. Some, like Apple, have burned down some of the money by returning it to shareholders in the form of dividends, or have bought back their own stock in an attempt to drive their share prices higher on the open market. Still, the trillions remain out of reach until the companies make peace with the taxes they will have to pay, and Apple CEO Tim Cook has testified to federal officials in favor of a tax holiday. Until that is resolved, inversions continue. Earlier this year, US healthcare company Medtronic merged with Ireland\u2019s Covidian in a tax inversion which drew little outrage. As more high-profile companies including Walgreen have flirted with the idea, however, the White House has demonstrated its displeasure. Burger King and Tim Hortons, perhaps seeking to avoid the wrath of Washington, played down the tax benefits in several conference calls with media and investors. Executives said the merger has no tax benefit, and Burger King also said that its current tax rate in the mid-20% range is comparable to the Canadian tax rate. Still, Burger King and Tim Hortons may protest too much. The US Treasury is already on alert from previous deals, and this pairing is a tasty morsel for federal officials who may wish to make an example of a prominent inversion deal. The merger \u201cis likely to add fuel to the fire around tax inversions,\u201d wrote Keith Moore, the founder of Wall Street trading-research firm MKM Partners. \u201cWith the US Treasury examining ways to curb inversions without specific legislation, this transaction could add to pressure to seek ways to discourage the strategy.\u201d The tension that has already built around inversions is likely to push the issue to a head in Congress, even in the expected doldrums of an election year. The US Treasury, which controls the Internal Revenue Service, initially said it couldn\u2019t stop the inversions on its own. More recently, Jack Lew said the Treasury was examining \u201cpossible administrative actions that could limit the ability of companies to engage in inversions.\u201d",

The US Treasury is already on alert from previous deals, and this pairing is a tasty morsel for federal officials who may wish to make an example of a prominent inversion deal.</p> <p>The merger \u201cis likely to add fuel to the fire around tax inversions,\u201d wrote Keith Moore, the founder of Wall Street trading-research firm MKM Partners. \u201cWith the US Treasury examining ways to curb inversions without specific legislation, this transaction could add to pressure to seek ways to discourage the strategy.\u201d</p> <p>The tension that has already built around inversions is likely to push the issue to a head in Congress, even in the expected doldrums of an election year. The US Treasury, which controls the Internal Revenue Service, initially said it couldn\u2019t stop the inversions on its own. More recently, Jack Lew said the Treasury was examining \u201cpossible administrative actions that could limit the ability of companies to engage in inversions.\u201d</p>",

    "webTitle": "Scottish yes vote and British EU exit could hit UK economy, says Sorrell", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "WPP boss Sir Martin Sorrell has warned that the prospect of Scotland voting for independence and Britain leaving the European Union could weaken the UK economy, adding to worries over heightened geopolitical tensions in Ukraine and the Middle East. The chief executive of the world's biggest advertising company said there was \"everything to play for\" before next month's Scottish independence referendum after Alex Salmond was widely seen to have won Monday's second televised debate. Polling by one of WPP's businesses has put the no campaign ahead, but the number of undecided voters is greater than the gap between the two sides, Sorrell said. \"It heightens the level of uncertainty, so it's not good. There is a vote and we don't know what the result is going to be. Whether it's a yes or a no, any business is having to think about what the implications of yes are.\" Even if Scotland voted to stay in the union, there might be further uncertainty for businesses if a strong yes vote led to calls for greater devolution from Westminster, Sorrell said. \"If it is very close, which it may be, they will say a lot of people voted yes and there will be devo max.\" The Guardian's snap poll of Scottish voters found that 71% believed Salmond, the Scottish National party leader, won his second debate with Alistair Darling, who heads the Better Together campaign. Darling had edged ahead in the first debate by concentrating on Salmond's lack of answers on the future of Scotland's currency, but failed to repeat the damage on Monday. Business leaders including HSBC's Scottish-born chairman, Douglas Flint, have warned that a vote for independence could damage Scotland's economy and reduce investment in the country. Sorrell said that with the general election nine months away, businesses were also worried about the UK leaving the EU, after David Cameron promised a referendum in 2017 if the Conservatives formed the next government. \"One thing to think about is what will happen if the Conservatives win the election or, as is more likely, they are the biggest party. It's very difficult for businesses to come to that view. It might affect the way they think about investing in the UK or what they do in the UK. It increases the level of uncertainty, which is not helpful.\" Sorrell said concerns over Scottish independence and EU membership came close to adding two more items to his existing list of four geopolitical \"known unknowns\" \u2013 where the problem is known but the outcome is in doubt: the fragility of the eurozone, tension in the Middle East, the fate of the Chinese economy and resolving the US deficit. With political tensions high in many international troublespots, the UK could do without self-created uncertainties, he said. A year ago, the eurozone was the biggest fear for business leaders, but at meetings with other business leaders, Sorrell said, he found events in Ukraine and the Middle East were now the leading concern. \"It [the eurozone] has been replaced by Russia and the Middle East, and in particular by Russia and the impact of sanctions. \"I was somewhat surprised, but people are really worried about the impact of sanctions spreading. Germany and other countries that trade with Russia are not going to be able to do that.\" Sorrell said that though clients were more confident than at the height of the financial crisis in 2008, the intensity of international political turmoil made them unwilling to take risks and invest. Instead, they were cutting costs and looking to mergers and acquisitions for growth. \"There are a lot of flashpoints. There seems to be more turmoil than for a long period, sadly. When you think about it that way, that is why people are so worried.\" WPP's businesses span advertising, marketing, PR and data analysis in more than 100 countries. In the first half of this year, the company's results were ravaged by the strength of the pound, Sorrell said. Revenues increased 2.7% to \u00a35.47bn, but were up 11.3% excluding currency movements. The UK was WPP's strongest market for underlying sales, rising 19.2% against 11.9% in Asia and other emerging markets. Despite his concerns about a referendum on EU membership, Sorrell said the chancellor, George Osborne, had done a good job to get the economy growing by keeping government spending under control.",

Until then, the assumption in Germany had been that despite 10 years of virtual stagnation and unemployment at 14%, one of the mainstream parties would emerge victorious in the French presidential elections due the following month. Yet, with the campaign in its final stages, opinion polls suggested Marine Le Pen, leader of the extreme rightwing Front National, was on course to become the next president of France. Le Pen's message was simple. France should leave the euro, run its own economic policy along protectionist lines and have a blanket ban on immigration. How did it come to this? For the past five years, ever since the election of Fran\u00e7ois Hollande as socialist president in 2012, Germany had called the shots in Europe. Hollande's early attempts to forge an anti-austerity coalition with Spain and Italy quickly came to nothing and by the late summer of 2014 the French president purged his government of those on the left of his party calling for growth to be given a higher priority than reducing the budget deficit. Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, saw this as the moment that Hollande finally grew up. She praised his commitment to budgetary rigour and structural reform. France, she said, should prove itself to be as committed to reform as Spain, Europe's poster child for austerity in the tough zero-growth year of 2014. French Keynesians argued in vain that Spain was following the same beggar-thy-neighbour route pursued in the 1930s when countries sought to grab a bigger share of a shrinking market by devaluing their currencies and putting up tariff barriers. Spain had followed the German prescription to the letter. It cut wages in order to make Spanish exports more competitive, but the knock-on effect was to make life more difficult for French and Italian producers. Almost halfway through his presidency in August 2014, Hollande had yet to preside over two successive quarters of positive growth. The economy had flatlined in the first two quarters of the year and the jobless rate remained stubbornly above 10%. Hollande's approval rating had slumped to 17%. What France needed in the summer of 2014 was a more aggressive monetary policy from the European Central Bank and for Berlin to announce a Marshall Plan for Europe. What it got was more of the same, with few of the rough edges knocked off. The policy errors of the late 1920s and early 1930s were repeated, resulting in longer dole queues and rising levels of poverty.

With some 35% of all lender loans no longer being serviced, the country\u2019s central bank reckons that an estimated \u20ac75bn in total is currently owed to banks, among the largest amounts in global financial history and for a nation off just over 11 million proportionately by far the largest in the EU. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s the biggest headache for our banking system and a major drain on our ability to provide credit,\u201d said one banker requesting anonymity. \u201cThe new code has been a priority over the summer.\u201d </p> <p>Ahead of EU-wide stress tests in October, Greece\u2019s central bank has now devised a new code (yet to be fine-tuned) that reportedly allows \u2018compromise solutions\u2019 to be found for lenders and debtors. </p> <p>Rubber-stamped by the Committee of Credit and Insurance Matters on Monday the code, say insiders, foresees \u201chaircuts\u201d being extended to loans, revisions on interest repayments, the conversion of mortgages into rental contracts and the voluntary return of properties to banks (a way for lenders not to be seen to be forcibly requisitioning assets).

      "bodyText": "The prospect of stimulus measures such as QE by the European Central Bank, as floated by Mario Draghi in the US on Friday, has continued to support markets. European markets recovered ground after an early dip while the FTSE 100 played catch up after Monday\u2019s Bank Holiday to reach a seven week high (details in Nick Fletcher\u2019s closing market report). Sentiment was also helped by better than expected US consumer confidence and durable goods figures, while the collapse of the French government caused few ripples. Hopes of easing tensions in the Ukraine as well as Gaza was the icing on the cake. So the closing scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 47.76 points or 0.7% at 6822.76 Germany\u2019s Dax rose 0.82% to 9588.15 France\u2019s Cac closed 1.18% better at 4393.41 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB added 1.33% to 20,645.54 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 1.28% higher at 10,826.9 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 0.34% or 57 points higher while the S&amp;P 500 has hit yet another new high of 2003. On that note, it\u2019s time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments and we\u2019ll be back again tomorrow. Time to recap, I think... One of Britain\u2019s top businesspeople has warned that the Scottish independence vote, and the upcoming UK referendum on European Union membership, are \u201cgrey swan\u201d risks to the recovery. Sir Martin Sorrell argued this morning that: There is all to play for as we go into the election. Obviously it does increase uncertainty in the UK, it\u2019s not good. [the question of] \u201cWhat is our position in relation to the European market, to the EU?\u201d is an added uncertainty. Sorrell also declared that geopolitical tensions in Russia, and the Middle East, has elbowed the eurozone down the list of biggest worries for business leaders. The eurozone was the big topic of conversation and concern this time last year. This year it\u2019s been replaced by the Middle East, and in particular by Russia and the impact of sanctions. US consumers don\u2019t appear to be too concerned. Consumer confidence has hit its highest level since October 2007, the autumn of the credit crunch. Burger King has confirmed that it is acquiring Canadian coffee chain Tim Hortons in an $11bn deal. Full story here. The move has prompted a backlash from some customers, who fear Burger King will use the acquisition to cut its tax bill. The other economic news from America is more mixed. Orders for durable goods have risen at a record rate, thanks to sales of aircraft. But house price growth is stalling. The prospect of the European Central Bank announcing new stimulus measures, such as a quantitative easing programme, send shares rallying in London today. The FTSE 100 is up 40 points, or 0.6%, in late trading. The French and German markets are also up again, adding to Monday\u2019s gains. Bond prices also strengthened, pushing yields on German, Spanish and Italian sovereign debt even lower. While in Greece, a new \u2018code of ethics\u2019 has been agreed to tackle its mountain of bad debts. The OECD has reported that advanced economies grew by just 0.4% in the second quarter of 2014, led by the US and UK. Burger King\u2019s decision to buy Canada\u2019s Tim Hortons for $11.4bn has gone down badly with some customers, who are unhappy that the fast food chain could shift its tax base to Canada. Thanks to the magic of social media, you can see the outrage unfolding on Burger King\u2019s Facebook page. This post summed up the mood: I pay my taxes and expect companies to do the same. If BK leaves the us to avoid taxes then I will never spend another dollar there! Senator Sherrod Brown has already suggested that customers should boycott Burger King if it inverts its tax base. One Facebooker wants the Senate to go further: As a veteran I encourage you to sponsor a bill that shuts down every single Burger King located on an American military installation in the U.S... Burger King management, meanwhile, insist that they\u2019re not being driven by the prospect of lower tax bills (perish the very thought, children) That may not quieten these critics: US consumer morale has surged to its highest level since the early days of the financial crisis. The monthly survey of US consumer confidence has just smashed expectations by jumping to 92.4 for August. That\u2019s the highest reading since October 2007, up from 90.3 in July, according to the Confidence Board\u2019s report. The report includes signs that the labor market picked up this month, with people reporting it was easier to find new jobs. Some caution is needed, though - other consumer confidence surveys have been less bullish recently, as this chart shows: Capital Economics aren\u2019t getting carried away by the surge in US durable goods orders, thanks to that spike in aircraft sales. They caution: July\u2019s spectacular durable goods orders provide a misleadingly strong signal on the strength of the economy, although the outlook for business investment is improving. And here\u2019s the details of the latest US housing data, showing that seasonally adjusted prices fell in several cities including Detroit, Minneapolis and San Francisco. The latest survey of US house prices has just hit the wires, and shows an unexpected dip in prices in June - suggesting the market may be losing steam. The S&amp;P/Case Shiller index of 20 metropolitan areas showed the average family home price fell 0.2% month-on-month, seasonally adjusted. Economists had expected a flat reading. On an unadjusted basis, prices at these 20 areas rose by 1%. Nationally, prices fell by 0.1% on a seasonally adjusted basis. Year-on-year, prices are up by 6.2% across America, but there are signs that the rally is petering out, as the US Federal Reserve moves closer to normalising monetary policy. S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices, which compiles the report, says it shows \u201ca sustained slowdown in price increases.\u201d David Blitzer, chairman of the Index Committee at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices, explains: \u201cHome price gains continue to ease as they have since last fall. The monthly National Index rose 0.9% in June. While all 20 cities saw higher home prices over the last 12 months, all experienced slower gains. In San Francisco, the pace of price increases halved since late last summer. The Sun Belt cities \u2013 Las Vegas, Phoenix, Miami and Tampa \u2013 all remain a third or more below their peak prices set almost a decade ago.\u201d In contrast, the average UK house price is now above its pre-crisis peak. Blitzer warns that the prospect of rising US interest rates will weigh on the market: \u201cBargain basement mortgage rates won\u2019t continue forever; recent improvements in the labor markets and comments from Fed chair Janet Yellen and others hint that interest rates could rise as soon as the first quarter of 2015. Rising mortgage rates won\u2019t send housing into a tailspin, but will further dampen price gains.\u201d The record-breaking durable goods survey also shows a 318% spike in demand for civilian planes. So why did aircraft orders shoot up so much last month? Well, as fastFT points out, July was the month of the Farnborough Airshow. The diplomatic spat between Russia and the UK, which saw its delegation recalled home, dominated attention. But behind the scenes, US aerospace firms must have been racking up the orders. Just in: orders for US durable goods have soared by a record amount, and it\u2019s all thanks to increased demand for aircraft. Durable goods orders surged by 22.6% in July, smashing expectations of a 7.5% rise. Strip out transportation orders, though, and orders for durable goods (items designed to last at least three years) fell by 0.8%. June\u2019s durable goods report has been revised higher, to +2.7% from +0.7% originally. A handy comparison: The Burger King deal values Tim Hortons at C$12.5bn, or almost \u00a37bn, btw. It\u2019s official: US fast food chain Burger King is merging with Canadian coffee and doughnut chain Tim Hortons. The deal will create the world\u2019s third-largest \u201cquick service\u201d restaurant company, more than 18,000 restaurants turning over a whopping $23bn of sales. The two companies will maintain the current \u201cglobal homes\u201d in Oakville and Miami respectively once the deal goes though. The merger is controversial, though -- it could allow Burger King cut its tax bills by shifting its tax domicile to Canada, where corporation tax is lower. Burger King\u2019s majority owners, 3G Capital, have agreed to pay $94.05 Canadian dollars per share for Tim Hortons, in cash and shares. Tim Hortons shares were worth around C$67 last week, before news of a possible deal broke. Warren Buffett has a part to play in the deal too -- his Berkshire Hathaway investment group is providing $3bn of financing. And Tim Hortons has reassured staff that there will be no changes to \u2018restaurant level\u2019 employment. There\u2019s a flurry of new data on the UK housing market today. First up, the number of new mortgages approved by lenders dipped last month to 42,792, below the recent average. But the average loan value increased, from \u00a3163,800 in June to \u00a3167,600 in July - as prices kept rising. More here: Small dip in July mortgage approvals offset by increase in average value Secondly, estate agent Savills has revised up its forecasts for price growth. It now expects average annual UK house price growth of 9.5% this year, ahead of the 6.5% originally forecast. Savills also acknowledged that London\u2019s property boom has taken it by surprise. It originally expected price growth of 8.5% this year - now upgraded to 15%. But over the next five years, average UK prices should slightly outpace the capital, it reckons, growing by 25%: Ireland\u2019s unemployment rate has hit its lowest level since the financial crisis struck the Celtic Tiger, as more people find work, and more people left the labour force altogether. The jobless rate across the Republic fell to 11.5% in the April-June quarter, the Central Statistics Office reported. Employment is up by 1.7% over the last year, with 31,600 more people finding work. And the number of unemployed people dropped by 46,200, taking the total to 254,500. The total labour force has contracted too, by 14,500. Another chart from the OECD, showing how the UK and US economies outpaced the major economies in the last quarter: Growth has picked up in the world\u2019s major developed economies, with the UK and US making up for the weakness of Japan and the eurozone. That\u2019s according to a new report from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development reports. It says GDP across the 33 countries who make up the OECD area rose by 0.4% in April-June, up from 0.2% in January-March. There was \u201ca wide spectrum of patterns across countries\u201d, though. Real quarterly growth in the US surged by 1%, followed by Britain with 0.8%. Japan contracted by 1.7% as a new sales tax hit spending, Germany shrank by 0.2% and France was flat. South Africa\u2019s economy has returned to growth, avoiding a new recession, but not expanding as fast as hoped. Statistics South Africa reports that the country\u2019s GDP rose by 0.6% in the second quarter of 2014, reversing the 0.6% contraction recorded in January-March. Economists had predicted growth of 0.9%. On an annual basis, GDP is up by 1%, compared to 1.6% in the previous quarter, indicating a slowdown. Over to Greece where the debt-stricken country\u2019s central bank has devised a new \u201ccode of ethics\u201d to deal with the ever worsening problem of non performing loans. Our correspondent Helena Smith reports from Athens: It\u2019s a problem that has mirrored Greece\u2019s seemingly never ending debt crisis: the issue of non performing loans. With some 35% of all lender loans no longer being serviced, the country\u2019s central bank reckons that an estimated \u20ac75bn in total is currently owed to banks, among the largest amounts in global financial history and for a nation off just over 11 million proportionately by far the largest in the EU. \u201cIt\u2019s the biggest headache for our banking system and a major drain on our ability to provide credit,\u201d said one banker requesting anonymity. \u201cThe new code has been a priority over the summer.\u201d Ahead of EU-wide stress tests in October, Greece\u2019s central bank has now devised a new code (yet to be fine-tuned) that reportedly allows \u2018compromise solutions\u2019 to be found for lenders and debtors. Rubber-stamped by the Committee of Credit and Insurance Matters on Monday the code, say insiders, foresees \u201chaircuts\u201d being extended to loans, revisions on interest repayments, the conversion of mortgages into rental contracts and the voluntary return of properties to banks (a way for lenders not to be seen to be forcibly requisitioning assets). Foreclosures will be activated if mortgage borrowers are seen to be deliberately uncooperative - with the collapse of property prices many Greeks, hit by austerity measures, simply gave up on repayments as the crisis intensified. \u201cSuch steps have been taken in other [EU] countries to handle non performing loans. Frankly we\u2019ve dragged our feet. It\u2019s in no one\u2019s interest to have this hanging,\u201d said the banker. \u201cAll round this should be a relief.\u201d Former finance minister Yannis Stournaras who assumed the post of governor of the bank of Greece earlier this summer, is believed to be pushing hard for the code of ethics to be applied before the stress tests later this year. Bankers have not hidden their concerns that Greek lenders may need big capital injections to survive (despite huge injections received so far) following the tests. As if all these grey swans weren\u2019t bad enough, WPP is also suffering from the strong pound. The ad company said its revenues had been \u201cravaged\u201d by the strength of sterling (which meant that overseas revenues were worth less when converted into pounds). Bunzl, the distribution and outsourcing group, had a similar tale for the City this morning, saying the strong pound has \u201csignificantly decreased\u201d its growth. Sorry, I should have explained what Sorrell means by saying Scottish independence and Britain\u2019s potential exit from the EU are \u2018Grey Swan\u2019 risks. He\u2019s harking back to Nassim Taleb\u2019s \u201cBlack Swan\u201d theory, which argued that financial markets (and the rest of us) fail to predict certain events because they fall outside previous experience so can\u2019t be anticipated, even though they have seismic consequences. A Grey Swan, in Sorrell\u2019s terms, is a \u201cknown unknowns\u201d -- an event that can be predicted, but whose impact is unclear. Other Grey Swans include the weak eurozone economy, and the prospect of a \u2018hard landing\u2019 in China, or the wider developing economies. Martin Sorrell has also voiced his concerns about Scottish independence to the BBC: Sir Martin Sorrell has also warned that the prospects of Scotland voting for independence, and Britain leaving the European Union, could both threaten the UK economy. The head of advertising giant WPP told Reuters this morning that these issues are \u201cgrey swans\u201d that could disrupt the recovery. TNS, which is WPP\u2019s polling arm, currently has the \u201cNo to independence\u201d vote leading, but the number of \u2018don\u2019t knows\u2019 is larger than the gap that the Yes side needs to scale. And with Alex Salmond winning last night\u2019s debate with Alistair Darling, the vote could still be wide open. Sorrell explains: There is all to play for as we go into the election. Obviously it does increase uncertainty in the UK, it\u2019s not good. [the question of] \u201cWhat is our position in relation to the European market, to the EU?\u201d is an added uncertainty. Those fears around Brexit will escalate as we mover closer to 2017 when the in/out referendum will take place (assuming the Conservatives form the next government), he added. The debates will start with regard to \u201cour role, or non-role\u201d, in Europe closer to that time, Sorrell says. Russia has replaced the eurozone as the major worry facing the global economy, WPP boss Sir Martin Sorrell has warned. Sorrell says he met with fellow business leaders in Geneva, and saw the geopolitics has raced up the agenda. In an interview with Reuters (online here), Sorrell explained: The eurozone was the big topic of conversation and concern this time last year. This year it\u2019s been replaced by the Middle East, and in particular by Russia and the impact of sanctions. Those sanctions will start to bite in the months ahead, and could have a knock-on effect on hurt businesses across Europe. The slowest growing region for WPP this year is Western Continental Europe, Sorrell says. France, Italy and Spain all remain quite fragile. And on France.... Sorrell also says that the latest French political crisis show the \u201ctremendous political tensions\u201d between people who want more austerity and cost controls and those who want Keynesian stimulus. France is not complying with what Brussels and Mario Draghi want in terms of budget control, Sorrell concludes, contrasting it with Britain, where the chancellor has done a \u201cgreat job\u201d and \u201cthe economy is growing at 4%\u201d. European government bonds are also strengthening in value this morning, driven by the prospect of an ECB QE programme. Yesterday\u2019s fall in business confidence in Germany is also pushing investors into safe-haven assets such as German bunds. The yield, or interest rate, on German 10-year bunds has fallen to just 0.932% today. Italian 10-year bond yields have dropped by 5 basis points, from 2.45% to 2.4%, and Spanish yields are down a chunky 7 basis points to 2.19%. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets explains how Mario Draghi\u2019s speech on Friday night is making waves. Draghi\u2019s speech has been construed as a significant departure from the usual rhetoric usually used by ECB heads, in that he has ventured into areas normally reserved for politicians, and is particularly notable at a time when the political temperature in Europe looks set to rise further in the wake of the collapse of the French government, which is under increasing pressure from Brussels and Berlin to get its spending under control. Despite these political concerns and yet another poor German IFO business confidence survey yesterday European stock markets rose sharply on Monday as markets looked to price in the prospect of further policy easing by the ECB in an attempt to try and boost economic growth in the euro area. The London stock market is open after the long weekend, and staging a small rally. Mario Draghi\u2019s pledge to use \u201call available instruments\u201d to help the eurozone is cheering the City. The FTSE 100 rose 39 points, or 0.55%, at the start of trading to 6815. European markets are dipping a little, though, after yesterday\u2019s big rally. Reuters has a good piece on the French political crisis, sparked by the dismissal of economy minister (and austerity critic) Arnaud Montebourg: France\u2019s prime minister will scramble to put together a new pro-reform government on Tuesday, a day after the surprise eviction of rebel ministers who had opposed budgetary rigor. Manuel Valls will seek as wide a basis as possible for his second cabinet in five months ahead of tough negotiations at home and with EU peers on France\u2019s 2015 budget and he is expected to try to poach politicians from other parties. Economists reckon Valls\u2019 new administration could benefit from a tighter focus on economic plans; at a time when France is struggling to grow, and missing the budget targets agreed with Brussels. An unrepentant Montebourg, though, repeated his call for a new plan last night, telling reporters: The whole world is begging us to put an end to these absurd austerity policies which are burying the euro zone deeper and deeper in recession and which will soon end up with deflation. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the economy, the eurozone and business. The London stock market is expected to rise this morning as investors respond to the prospect of fresh stimulus measures from the European Central Bank to help the struggling eurozone economy and fight deflation. City traders meandering back to their desks after a soggy bank holiday missed yesterday\u2019s strong rally in other European markets, which saw the French CAC surge over 2%. They\u2019re likely to push the FTSE 100 up by around 35 points, back over the 6,800 mark. Mario Draghi\u2019s speech last Friday does appear to be another significant moment in the crisis. The ECB chief\u2019s pledge to use \u201call available instruments\u201d is seen as a prelude to a quantitative easing programme (QE) from Europe\u2019s central bank. This prospect rippled as far as Wall Street, helping to push pushed the S&amp;P 500 index over the 2000 point mark for the first time ever last night. And the euro is hovering near its lowest level in a year, at $1.32 to the dollar. Stan Shamu of IG explains: Driving sentiment across the globe at the moment are bets we will see further stimulus from some of the major central banks. In European trade [yesterday] investors responded to Mario Draghi\u2019s comments from the weekend in an overwhelmingly positive way and euro weakness helped to give equities an extra kicker. A QE programme (buying assets with newly minted money) wouldn\u2019t actually drag the eurozone out of its low-growth, low-inflation torpor on its own, mind you. And that\u2019s why Mario Draghi also called for more growth-friendly fiscal policies last Friday; a hot topic right now in France, where the government resigned yesterday as a row over its austerity programme erupted. France thrown into political turmoil after government dissolved President Holland has ordered Prime Minister Manuel Valls to form a new cabinet \u201cconsistent with the direction set for the country\u201d. We should get details later today. Investors will also be watching the talks between Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko and Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin, at a summit in Minsk today. Otherwise, it\u2019s a fairly quiet day, until a splurge of US economic data this afternoon \u2013 including durable goods sales at 1.30pm, and consumer confidence survey at 3pm.",

Bunzl climbed 9p to \u00a316.39 as the business supplies company reported a 5% rise in six month profits to \u00a3176.6m despite revenues falling because of the strength of the pound. Half year profits at advertising giant WPP was also hit by the sterling move, but its shares ended 17p higher at \u00a312.44 as the company stuck to its growth targets for the year. Lower down the market, Regus was another victim of the pound, with its shares down 17.5p to 179p after pretax profits fell slightly to \u00a331m. The office provider said it would open at least 450 business centres this year but analysts were concerned this would add to costs, increase debts and depress earnings in the short term. Data centre business Telecity lost 45.5p to 716p as it announced chief executive Michael Tobin would step down. Elsewhere Antofagasta fell 9.5p to 798.5p after the Chilean copper miner said first half profits had dropped 11.5% to a lower than expected $1.13bn, hit by higher production costs and lower metal prices. Oil and gas services company Petrofac dipped 3p to \u00a311.23 as it reported a slump in first half profit from $243m to $136m, hit by various project delays. Finally Asos added 168p or 7.6% to \u00a323.48 on vague speculation of interest in the online fashion retailer. Weekend reports suggested Asos could face increased competition from Next, but traders ignored that and pointed to talk that the likes of eBay could be looking at the business, with a price of up to \u00a350 a share mentioned.",

      "bodyText": "The number of homes across Britain valued at \u00a31m or more has increased by 49% over the past year, according to figures published on Tuesday. Living in a road of \u00a31m-plus homes is no longer a badge of exclusivity. The property website Zoopla, which compiled the data, found that there are 3,744 streets in London where the price of homes is on average higher than \u00a31m, and 10,613 across the country. It estimated that 484,081 households can now claim to be property millionaires. The true price of entry into the property big league is now at least \u00a310m, with estate agents preferring billionaires rather than buyers commanding only six zeroes. Zoopla found 12 streets, all in the capital, where house prices averaged more than \u00a310m. Kensington Palace Gardens finished top of the list. Britain's most expensive street is made up of vast detached palaces that sell on average for \u00a342.7m \u2013 up 12% over the last year and 161 times the average UK home price \u2013 and whose super-elite residents include Chelsea football club owner Roman Abramovich and steel magnate Lakshmi Mittal. A somewhat worn-out five-bed apartment on a 1960s block in the road, which even the agents admit is \"in need of modernisation\", is on the market for \u00a323.5m. It does, however, include a \"chauffeur's room\". The next most expensive street in Britain is the Boltons, also in Kensington, where average prices are \u00a326.6m. This summer, one owner on the street, Paul Burdell, put his home on the market inviting buyers to pay \u00a320.5m and then knock it down. The multimillionaire debt collector, whose firm specialises in tracking down hard-up families who owe money to banks and credit card companies, won a lengthy battle against neighbours, including footballer Frank Lampard, for permission to demolish his home and rebuild it with three storeys underground, including a swimming pool, gym and cinema, but now wants to sell. Britain's third most expensive street, Grosvenor Crescent, is a busy road running off Hyde Park Corner, where properties change hands for an average of \u00a322.3m. But even that doesn't get you your own front door or garden. Agents recently marketed a three-bed flat on the crescent for \u00a318m, while a two-bed flat was listed for rental last year at \u00a37,150 a month. For that, tenants have to make do with a lounge-cum-diner and a second bedroom that is just 8ft x 11ft. Outside London, the most expensive street in Britain is Sunninghill Road in Surrey, where the average home is currently worth \u00a35.6m. The two most expensive towns outside London are both in Surrey, with average house prices in Virginia Water at \u00a31.2m and in Cobham at a shade over \u00a31m.
