The move by Co-operative Food \u2013 in its attempt to become the UK\u2019s number one convenience retailer \u2013 will escalate the price war between the big five supermarkets, in the face of the ongoing threat posed by discounters Aldi and Lidl. The investment by Co-op will see some fresh produce prices halved and discounts on more than 100 lines. The price salvo will prune a range of popular fresh fruit and vegetables, starting with iceberg lettuce, carrots (500g) and whole cucumbers priced at just 39p each. The programme has already been trialled in Wales. The supermarket business is part of the of the troubled Co-operative Group, which returned to profit after a recovery in its grocery stores and the sale of its pharmacies and farmland helped the mutual to bounce back from near collapse. The beleaguered group, which includes food, insurance and funeral care businesses, posted profits before tax of \u00a3124m in the year to January 3, compared with a \u00a3310m loss in 2013. Steve Murrells, retail chief executive, said: \u201cConsumers are shopping differently, buying little, more frequently and, increasingly swapping the weekly shop for purchasing what they need, when they need it. \u201cFood retailing remains highly competitive and we have responded to provide customers with great prices and fresh, quality produce at each of our stores. This makes our price investment the biggest by a convenience retailer, providing consumers across the length and breadth of the UK with lower priced produce and helping them to keep shopping in their neighbourhood.\u201d The Co-op food business is this year aiming to open 100 new convenience stores and will update another 255 outlets. Vowing to ditch its larger stores to focus on convenience, the society revealed last month that it had sold 37 larger stores in the year up to 3 January, leaving it with 71 superstores and 2,079 convenience stores. It is also aiming to boost its presence within the M25, where it has in the past been under-represented. Last year, Morrisons promised to invest more than \u00a31bn in lowering price over three years. This month its new chief executive, David Potts, the former Tesco executive who replaced Dalton Phillips at the top, made his first move in the battle of the supermarkets, cutting the cost of 200 products including bread, milk, butter, sugar and other staples. In January, Sainsbury\u2019s promised to spend \u00a3100m on reducing prices on 1,000 products this year, while Asda invested \u00a3300m in lowering prices in the first quarter. Tesco then followed suit with its own price reductions.",

      "bodyText": "And finally, Alexis Tsipras\u2019s defiant and confrontational speech this afternoon makes the front page of The Guardian: And here\u2019s a flavour, for anyone whose not been following this blog for the last 15 hours :) Fears that the five-year Greek financial crisis will culminate in debt default and exit from the euro have intensified as Athens hardened its rhetoric against its creditors and insisted it would miss a payment to the International Monetary Fund unless it received debt relief. With just 48 hours to go before a meeting of eurozone finance ministers, seen as the last realistic chance to reach a deal before Greece has to pay the IMF at the end of June, Alexis Tsipras, showed no sign of bowing to demands for cuts in pensions and increases in VAT. Instead, the Greek prime minister accused the Fund of \u201ccriminal responsibility\u201d for the situation and said lenders were seeking to \u201chumiliate\u201d his country. Greece would face unprecedented hardship if capital controls were introduced, and the Syrizia party would see its populist support plummet rather fastRead more Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European commission, reflected the anger in Brussels at the way Tsipras has been approaching the deadlocked negotiations by saying he had \u201csympathy for the Greek people but not the Greek government\u201d. Juncker was until recently rated as one of Tsipras\u2019s only allies. EU officials wereon Tuesday night making preparations for a crisis meeting of leaders on Sunday if, as now expected, the talks between finance ministers on Thursday prove fruitless. Amid the third straight day of sharp declines on the Athens stock market, EU leaders are for the first time talking openly about Greek default and its ejection from the euro. Valdis Dombrovskis, vice-president of the commission, said eurozone leaders were discussing \u201cless favourable scenarios\u201d for Greece, while the Finnish prime minister, Juha Sipila, said an agreement with Greece now would require a miracle.... And if you can\u2019t wait for the paperboy or girl, here\u2019s the full story: Greek exit real prospect as eurozone hardens towards belligerent Athens I think that\u2019s all for tonight -- see you tomorrow for more of the same. Goodnight! GW JP Morgan analysts have predicted tonight that restrictions on Greek banks could be brought in this weekend, if eurozone finance ministers fail to make progress in 48 hours time. Look who\u2019s sitting on the front page of the FT tonight.... Even though the Dow Jones index rose today, investors are still jittery about the eurozone. Scott Brown, chief economist at Raymond James in St. Petersburg, Florida, says: \u201cThe market is still anxious about Greece and would like the situation to be dealt with one way or another. The week-after-week uncertainty isn\u2019t good for the market.\u201d Wall Street also has one eye on tomorrow\u2019s Federal Reserve meeting, for signs that a rate rise is close.... Wall Street remains optimistic too. The New York stock index has closed for the night, with shares in the green: Over 40% of City investors are hopeful that this crisis will result in a deal, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch: City analysts are catching up with events today. BNP Paribas, the French bank, reckons there\u2019s a roughly even chance of Greece defaulting (so let\u2019s just flip a coin....). Perhaps more usefully, BNPP also point out that Greece might not lose its eurozone membership; after all, there\u2019s no obvious way to expel a euro member. America has just made a new intervention in the crisis tonight. US Treasury secretary Jack Lew has telephoned Alexis Tsipras to urge him to reach a realistic compromise, urgently. In a statement, the Treasury revealed that Lew told Tsipras that the Greek people, and the global economy, would suffer if Athens can\u2019t reach a deal with creditors. It added: \u201cLew underscored the urgency of Greece making a serious move to reach a pragmatic compromise with its creditors.\u201d The intervention came shortly after White House spokesman spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters that the US is eager to see the Greek crisis resolved soon. Last month, Lew told an audience in London that all sides should \u201cdouble down\u201d their efforts to get a deal fast. That plea didn\u2019t spark a deal, so with just two weeks to go until Greece\u2019s bail expires, Lew has made this fresh intervention. Over in Athens the government\u2019s spokesman has just released a statement attempting to douse tensions with EU commission president Jean-Claude Juncker, reports Helena Smith . Responding to the EU commission chief\u2019s thinly disguised fury today, the Greek government - acutely aware that the Luxembourger is among Greece\u2019s greatest supporters - has moved fast to kiss and make up. \u201cWe never said it was the view of the Commission, or of Mr Juncker personally,\u201d said the statement referring to the cash-for-reforms proposal that Juncker handed prime minister Alexis Tsipras last week. \u201c[We laid the blame] with the entire proposal made by the three institutions.\u201d [Greece\u2019s lenders]. It was, the statement said, \u201cpositive\u201d that the EU chief had made it clear that he, too, also disagreed with several of the proposal\u2019s aspects. \u201cThe Greek government has submitted proposals with measures that fully cover the fiscal gap, transferring the burden from the weakest social classes as well as suggesting a reduction in defense spending.\u201d Jean-Claude Juncker\u2019s statement that he\u2019s had \u2018no contact\u2019 with the Greek government since Sunday doesn\u2019t tell the full story. Our Europe editor, Ian Traynor, points out that the European Commission president has been in contact with Greek politicians and officials this week, so it would be wrong to think he\u2019s frozen off all contact with Greece.... And here\u2019s a clearly disgruntled Jean-Claude Juncker today, as he he tore into the Greek government. As we covered earlier, Juncker accused Alexis Tsipras\u2019s administration of misleading voters about proposals he had made to help solve the country\u2019s debt crisis. According to Reuters, the president of the European Commission declared: \u201cI don\u2019t care about the Greek government, I do care about the Greek people,\u201d he said noting that many \u201care suffering more than others in the European Union\u201d from efforts to reduce debts. \u201cThe debate in Greece and outside Greece would be easier if the Greek government would tell exactly what the Commission ... is really proposing. I am blaming the Greeks (for telling) things to the Greek public which are not consistent with what I\u2019ve told the Greek prime minister.\u201d Greece\u2019s president has waded in declaring that he will do everything in his power to ensure the debt-strcken country remains in the eurozone. Helena Smith reports from Athens On a day marked by escalating brinkmanship and fiery rhetoric, Greece\u2019s head of state, president Prokopis Pavlopoulos has, in a rare intervention, stepped in saying \u201ca solid national front\u201d is needed to ensure the country remains in the euro zone. Pavlopoulos, a veteran former conservative MP, whose election earlier this year won unanimous support in the 300-seat House, said it was his role to secure Athens\u2019 place at Europe\u2019s core in the single currency. In comments aired this afternoon, Pavlopoulos said: \u201cI know that my role, not least because of my election by the majority of the parliament who chose me, is to ensure the course of the country in Europe and the euro zone.\u201d Adding: \u201cIn front of this aim there has to be a solid internal front of all democratic forces. Petty party views and friction can\u2019t come before the achievement of such a goal.\u201d The head of state, who once represented the staunchly pro-European centre right New Democracy party, said he was \u201cdetermined in the framework of my authorities and touching the boundaries of my authorities to fulfill this mission.\u201d Over in Washington, the White House has given all parties in the Greek bailout saga a nudge to sort this crisis out, soon, without rattling the financial markets. Spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters that the US hopes the situation is resolved before it has a negative impact on the world economy. America has been dropping increasingly heavy hints in recent weeks that the Greek crisis needs to be cleaned up, before triggering a repeat of the chaos we lived through in 2008 after the collapse of Lehman Brothers. The early signs that Greece was moving closer to the brink sent investors heading for the doors. But despite the rhetoric from Greek president Alexis Tsipras in parliament, there were growing hopes a deal of some sort could perhaps be done after all. With Wall Street moving higher in early trading - ahead of Wednesday\u2019s US Federal Reserve comments on interest rates - most markets managed to regain some ground. Greece was an exception, with the Athens market falling again to record a 14.59% decline in the past three sessions. Overall the scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished virtually unchanged, down just 0.42 points at 6710.10 Germany\u2019s Dax added 0.54% to 11,044.01 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.51% higher at 4839.86 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB edged up 0.25% to 22,383.48 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 0.27% at 10,871.4 The Athens market fell 4.77% to 703.05 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 85 points or 0.48%. European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker has come out fighting: 16-Jun-2015 16:53:36 - EU\u2019S JUNCKER SAYS DOESN\u2019T CARE ABOUT GREEK GOVT BUT ABOUT GREEK PEOPLE 16-Jun-2015 16:54:00 - EU\u2019S JUNCKER SAYS HAS HAD NO CONTACT WITH GREEK GOVT SINCE SUNDAY BECAUSE NEGOTIATIONS GOING NOWHERE 16-Jun-2015 16:54:26 - EU\u2019S JUNCKER SAYS WOULD BE MAJOR MISTAKE TO INCREASE GREEK VAT ON MEDICINES AND ELECTRICITY 16-Jun-2015 16:55:05 - EU\u2019S JUNCKER SAYS BLAMES GREEK GOVT FOR TELLING VOTERS THINGS THAT ARE NOT WHAT JUNCKER TOLD GOVT And there we have it: European Central Bank board member Yves Mersch has tried to pour cold water on the idea of a Grexit: Meanwhile the ECB\u2019s Klaas Knot has said Greek banks are solvent at the moment and can take some stress although - and no surprises here - they would be in trouble if Greece defaulted (courtesy Reuters). A reminder that the ECB will soon make its weekly decison on the emergency funding given to Greek banks, which will continue as long as they are deemed to be solvent. So Knot\u2019s comments seem to suggest the ECB will not pull the plug on the so-called emergency liquidity assistance yet. Speaking of Varoufakis, Germany\u2019s Spiegel Online has some quotes from today. He told them the proposals for spending cuts and reforms were already so harsh and brutal, the Germans themselves would never accept them. He said: Greece will only commit to them if Europe agrees to a debt restructuring, investments and an end to the liquidity crisis. And he advised \u201cAsk [Angela] Merkel\u201d if an agreement would be reached this week. In case anyone was wondering where Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis was during the fiery speech in parliament from prime minister Alexis Tspiras, here he is listening, combining casual with intensity: More talks, but this time it is Cyprus president Nicos Anastasiades getting in on the act. According to China\u2019s Xinhua News Agency, he will be speaking with EU officials some time today about the Greek crisis: His spokesman said that Anastasiades earlier in the day had a telephone conversation with the president of Greece, Prokopis Pavlopoulos, \u201cin connection with Greece\u2019s effort to reach a deal with (European) institutions\u201d. When asked whether finance minister Harris Georgiades will take up any mediatory role in Greece\u2019s effort to close a deal with its international lenders, the spokesman said the question should be what the president will do following his conversation with the Greek President. \u201cThe president will possibly have telephone talks with European Union leaders and those in charge of institutions involved in the negotiations, tonight or tomorrow at the latest,\u201d the spokesman said. He did not say either whom Anastasiades will talk to or what line he will take on the Greek issue. But sources said that he will probably call German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Francois Hollande, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and European Central Bank president Mario Draghi. Besides Greece, Cyprus is the only other euro country still in a bailout program after it was pulled back from bankruptcy in a \u20ac10bn financial assistance deal signed in March 2013. It is expected to return to growth this year after four years in recession and end its memorandum obligations next year. And here\u2019s a thought to put things in perspective: US markets are in positive territory in early trading, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average up around 50 points. The latest US Federal Reserve meeting starts today with the central bank\u2019s latest thinking on interest rates due to be announced tomorrow. Investors believe there will be no increase in borrowing costs until later in the year at the earliest. The rise on Wall Street has helped mitigate some of the gloom in Europe, with Germany\u2019s Dax and France\u2019s Cac now in positive territory after earlier falls, and the FTSE 100 now down just 8 points. Hopes that Greece can come to a deal with its creditors, despite prime minister Alexis Tspiras\u2019 rhetoric in parliament earlier. Pimco, the asset manager which is part of insurer Allianz, has increased its holding of Greek debt and is second only to the ECB, according to Bloomberg: Allianz SE, Europe\u2019s biggest insurer and asset manager, increased its holdings of Greek sovereign debt to more than \u20ac1.2bn from about \u20ac1bn reported in May. Allianz, through its asset manager Pimco Investment Management Co., had the largest holdings of Greek bonds of any investor after the European Central Bank, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Pimco invests capital on behalf of clients. Allianz\u2019s direct exposure to Greece is \u20ac2m, according to its first-quarter earnings. The AFP newswire have just published the details of Alexis Tsipras\u2019s attack on the International Monetary Fund in the Greek parliament today. IMF has \u2018criminal responsibility\u2019 for Greek crisis: PM Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras said the International Monetary Fund had \u201ccriminal responsibility\u201d for Greece\u2019s debt crisis on Tuesday, and called on the country\u2019s European creditors to assess the IMF\u2019s policies. \u201cThe time has come for the IMF\u2019s proposals to be judged not just by us but especially by Europe,\u201d Tsipras told his parliamentary group, two days after the failure of debt talks with the IMF and the European Union brought Greece closer to a possible default. \u201cThe IMF has criminal responsibility for today\u2019s situation.\u201d. Acrimonious talks over the past five months have seen the Fund insist on further cuts to Greece\u2019s pension system and a rise in value-added tax on basic goods, like electricity, which Athens says will only deepen hardships for ordinary Greeks. \u201cRight now, what dominates is the IMF\u2019s harsh views on tough measures, and Europe\u2019s on denying any discussion over debt viability,\u201d Tsipras said, adding: \u201cThe fixation on cuts... is most likely part of a political plan... to humiliate an entire people that has suffered in the past five years through no fault of its own,\u201d \u201cThe time has come for the IMF\u2019s proposals to be judged in public.. .by Europe,\u201d he told the MPs of his radical left Syriza party. Here\u2019s Helena Smith\u2019s instant verdict on Alexis Tsipras\u2019s address Tsipras\u2019 speech was aimed as much at an internal audience \u2013 in this case his own far left Syriza party \u2013 as audiences in the corridors of economic power abroad. It contained some nuggets: there were forces in Europe that were working towards a fair deal, (for which read the European Commission) as there were forces working against, he said, singling out the IMF for taking a particularly hard stance. In a nod to hardliners (for which, soon, we may have to read Syriza\u2019s ENTIRE parliamentary group), Tsipras repeated the mantra that proposals made by creditors, so far, were \u201cabsurd and unrealistic.\u201d He told MPs: \u201cThey are asking us to accept an agreement which will drag us into a vortex of recession and uncertainty. We submitted a proposal for a viable deal and got back a 5-page text that ignored the negotiations that had already taken place.\u201d This was Tsipras, Greece\u2019s youngest premier and its first belonging to the radical left, in his stride, taking the moral high-ground, accusing creditors of skulduggery but also telling his MPs that the ultimate goal is the implementation of a visionary leftwing government program - \u201ca spring of democracy\u201d - over the next four years. The subtext is that, ultimately, any deal that is eventually reached should be wholeheartedly endorsed because it will be a stepping stone to overhauling the way Greece works. That is the cherry on the cake. And is why (short of there not being any deal at all) Syriza\u2019s cadres will give the agreement and the government their support when push comes to shove. While Alexis Tsipras was speaking, Angela Merkel was telling reporters in Berlin that \u201cunfortunately\u201d she has little new to report on Greece. The German chancellor said she hope the deadlock can be broken at Thursday\u2019s eurozone finance ministers meeting. Bloomberg has the details: \u201cI\u2019m concentrating all of my energy on helping the three institutions find a solution with Greece,\u201d Merkel told reporters. \u201cThat\u2019s what I see as my task. I want to do everything possible to keep Greece in the euro zone.\u201d That was quite a defiant speech by Alexis Tsipras, in which he insisted he won\u2019t bow to the demands of Greece\u2019s lenders, despite the growing risk of default. The Greek PM told his MPs: \u201cThe mandate we have got from the Greek people is to end austerity policy. \u201cIn order to achieve that, we have to seek a deal which will spread the burden evenly and which will not hurt wage earners and pensioners.\u201d It sounded inflammatory, at a time when lenders were hoping for conciliatory words. At one stage, Tsipras accused creditors of trying to \u201chumiliate\u201d Greece, with the European Central Bank insisting on financial \u201cstrangulation\u201d. And he even declared that the International Monetary Fund has \u201ccriminal responsibility\u201d for the damage caused to the Greek economy since its first bailout. So has he burned all his bridges? Perhaps, or maybe it\u2019s another dose of brinksmanship before a last-minute deal is cut. The key point, I think, is that Tsipras called for debt relief -- something the IMF also believes is needed. As he put it: Why do [European leaders] accept [the IMF\u2019s] harsh measures but not its proposals for debt restructuring?\u201d Nick Malkoutzis, of the Kathimerini newspaper, sees the framework of a deal: In conclusion, Tsipras tells his MPs that he will keep working towards a deal; one that is in line with his mandate to end austerity in Greece. We\u2019ll get the key quotes from Alexis Tsipras\u2019s speech soon (livefeed here). In the meantime, here are Reuters early news flashes, showing that the Greek PM is sticking to his guns: GREEK PM TELLS SYRIZA LAWMAKERS LENDERS\u2019 OBSESSION FOR A PROGRAMME OF CUTS CANNOT BE A MISTAKE, IT HAS POLITICAL ENDS GREEK PM TELLS SYRIZA LAWMAKERS SAYS LENDERS WANT TO HUMILIATE GREEK GOVT GREEK PM TELLS SYRIZA LAWMAKERS LENDERS ARE USING NEGOTIATIONS TO SHOW THEIR FORCE, WE ARE NEGOTIATING IN GOOD FAITH GREEK PM TELLS SYRIZA LAWMAKERS ECB INSISTING ON LINE OF FINANCIAL STRANGULATION GREEK PM SAYS DESPITE AGGRESSIVE STATEMENTS, THERE ARE POWERS IN EUROPE WORKING FOR A FAIR DEAL GREEK PM SAYS WE ARE IN THIS POSITION BECAUSE IMF WANTS DIFFICULT MEASURES AND EUROPE REFUSES DEBT RELIEF Tsipras does not appear to be caving in. At all. Instead, the Greek PM is questioning whether creditors are actually serious about getting a deal. Alexis Tsipras is insisting that Greece has done its best, and once again attacks the recent proposals from its creditors. Three weeks ago we produced a \u201ccomprehensive plan that could be viable\u201d, but lenders failed to also compromise. Instead, they insisted on unacceptable measures, such as wage cuts and higher taxes. Tsipras is arguing against early elections, saying Syriza can achieve a lot in the next four years. Bigger challenges lie ahead.... Alexis Tsipras is addressing his Syriza MPs in the Athens parliament now! Here\u2019s the livefeed Speaking in Greek to a silent chamber, Greece\u2019s prime minister is defending his decision to trigger January\u2019s general elections and take power. We knew we had to take responsibility, and fight the humanitarian crisis, he says. And Tsipras insists that his administrations has helped the poorest, despite the deadlock with lenders. More to follow.... European Commission vice-president Valdis Dombrovskis has revealed that there has been been \u201csome discussion within the eurozone\u201d of the implications of \u201cless favourable scenarios\u201d for Greece. That\u2019s via Reuters. That strongly suggests they are now planning for failure in the negotiations..... or at least firing a warning shot at Athens.... Alexis Tsipras will begin addressing his Syriza party\u2019s MPs in Athens shortly. It should be streamed live here. German tabloid Bild just gave the financial markets a jolt, by reporting that Greece wants to delay its \u20ac1.6bn IMF repayment until the end of this year. It says: According to information obtained by Bild, Greece doesn\u2019t want to pay back any of the June debt instalments to the IMF. It wants to postpone the repayments of the \u20ac1.55bn repayment due in June by six months. Bild claims that the Greeks have found \u201ca technical option to postpone the payment unilaterally, in the IMF rules.\u201d Under the Fund\u2019s rules, a country does have a month\u2019s grace before its Executive Board is formally notified, and they might not be formally suspended for 15 months. It is unclear whether Athens also wants to \u2013 or can \u2013 postpone its \u20ac6.7bn debt repayment to the ECB this summer, Bild adds. Athens officials quickly denied the report: Finland\u2019s prime minister has declared that it would take a \u201cmiracle\u201d to get a deal before Greece\u2019s bailout expires at the end of June. Speaking in Helsinki this morning, Juha Sipila also told reporters that EU leaders have \u201cmentally prepared\u201d for the prospect of Greece running out of cash. Reuters has the story: It would need a miracle to reach a deal between Greece and its creditors by the end-of-June deadline, the Finnish prime minister said on Tuesday. \u201cThe situation is tough and the timetable is tight. One could say that it needs a miracle to have this issue solved next week... But that is still the aim for everybody,\u201d Prime Minister Juha Sipila told reporters. \u201cThe possibility of (Greek) insolvency was discussed in the sidelines of the EU summit last week... several countries have mentally prepared for it,\u201d he added. If Sipila is correct, then there appears to be little chance that Greece will repay \u20ac1.6bn to the IMF on 30 June, given Alexis Tsipras\u2019s comments this morning. That wouldn\u2019t be a formal default (as the Fund isn\u2019t a commercial creditor), but it could force the ECB to reconsider the emergency liquidity it is providing to Greece\u2019s banks. The Greek stock market has slumped close to its lowest level since the summer of 2012 today, as the deadlock between Athens and its creditors continues to spook the markets. Bank shares are being routed again, as alarm spreads across trading floors. National Bank of Greece is down 7.8%, pulling the ATG index down another 3.8% to 709 points. That\u2019s only a few points above its recent low, set in mid-April. The news that Alexis Tsipras intends to not repay the IMF on 30 June, unless he has a deal, has helped keep other European markets deep in the red, at their lowest levels in four months. German DAX: down 1.2% France CAC: down 1% Spanish IBEX: down 1.5% Italian FTSE MIB: down 1.5% And in the bond markets, Greek debt is being hammered again - driving bond yields to increasingly alarming levels. As we covered earlier, Greece is refusing to submit new plans to its creditors. That\u2019s a clear \u201cline in the sand\u201d, ahead of Thursday\u2019s eurogroup meeting. Michael Hewson, analyst at CMC Markets, believes Athens has calculated it has nothing to lose by holding firm Why agree to a program that has manifestly failed on pretty much every level irrespective of the amount of blame to spread around, and it would be a massive climb-down at this late stage if they were to suddenly pull back? Tsipras may also believe that the US and EU will do whatever it takes to avoid Greece becoming a failed state, or too reliant on Russia. Hewson adds: This suggests irrespective of what happens in the coming days, and despite the dire warnings of non-compliance by German and EU officials, Greece will not be left to fend for itself, and Varoufakis and Tsipras must surely know this. With the IMF already uneasy about the sustainability of the current debt load it could be reasoned that Varoufakis surmises that the only way to open up a discussion on any form of debt renegotiation is for Greece to force the creditors hand, given they currently won\u2019t entertain the idea. And as there\u2019s no mechanism to force a country out of the eurozone, this saga could yet run for months..... Has the Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras made up his mind not to honour the \u20ac1.6bn debt repayment Athens must make to the IMF this month? Our correspondent Helena Smith reports that it has emerged the leader made clear in talks with opposition leader Stavros Theodorakis today that: \u201cthe government will not pay the IMF, if by the end of the month an agreement hasn\u2019t been achieved with lenders.\u201d According to Theodorakis\u2019 close aides, Tsipras described the decision as \u201cthe only route\u201d the government could take - if a cash-for-reform deal wasn\u2019t closed. This payment consists of four loan instalments due in June, which Athens elected earlier this month to bundle up into one payment. Default would not automatically mean euro exit \u2013 but it could set Greece\u2019s ejection from the single currency in motion. Greek media today has included wide coverage of the effects that a departure from the euro would have on ordinary Greeks, such as capital controls.... Fofi Gennimata, the new leader of Greece\u2019s left-wing Pasok party, has warned that it would be a \u201cdisaster\u201d if the country fails to reach a deal with creditors. Gennimata was speaking following her meeting with Alexis Tsipras this lunchtime (as previewed earlier) Enikos has the details: The newly elected leader of Pasok said that Greece is going through a critical time and what is required is \u201cfrank dialogue and consultation\u201d. She reintroduced an earlier Pasok proposal for a national negotiating team and stressed that the country \u201cneeds an agreement as soon as possible.\u201d Bruno Waterfield, The Times\u2019s man in Brussels, has heard that EU leaders are unlikely to hold an emergency summit on Sunday (as was rumoured earlier). He reckons there\u2019s still enough time to get any deal ratified by European parliaments, if needed (Germany\u2019s Bundestag may require a vote, if there is any new aid for Greece). Several analysts fear that capital controls could soon be implemented in Greece to stem the outflow of liquidity from its banks. Guy Foster, head of research at City firm Brewin Dolphin, suggests they could compromise three elements: Cash machine withdrawal limits Foreign transfer restrictions Physical currency limits - imposed at border controls The objective is to limit runs on banks, Foster explains: Capital controls would essentially buy time for a more serious resolution to the Greek crisis - namely a new government which can deliver reforms which might placate the creditors - so more talks and elections would follow. Alternatively these would have to be the circumstances under which a parallel currency would be introduced or a full exit could be planned. Stavros Theodorakis, the leader of Greece\u2019s centrist party, To Potami, has urged prime minister Alexis Tsipras to reach a deal soon. Emerging from talks with Tsipras this morning, Theodorakis warned that the situation is becoming perilous. He told reporters: \u201cI called on the prime minister to consider that the Greek economy is desperately close to its limits....Greek society is suffering from the constant postponement of a deal.\u201d Theodorakis added that European officials are worried that Greece may be \u201cflirting with other choices.\u201d \u201cThe country is at a crossroads ... where both [junctions] are difficult,\u201d he continued, emphasising that with each passing day the Greek economy was hit more from the adverse effects of the uncertainty now engulfing talks. Tsipras is meeting with other opposition leaders through the day. After Theodorakis, he sat down with Fofi Gennimata, elected as the first woman leader to the helm of Pasok on Sunday. Then he\u2019s due to meet Dora Bakoyannis, the former conservative foreign minister, who also announced yesterday that she would support a deal in Athens\u2019 300-seat House if it meant securing Greece\u2019s future in Europe. At 2pm local time (an hour later than originally scheduled) the prime minister will address the parliamentary group of his radical left Syriza party, now said to be at boiling point following publication of the measures outlined in the economic reform proposals submitted by Athens. Almost nobody (not least in Syriza) believes that the deal in its proposed form is ENFORCEABLE. Last night I spoke to the deputy defence minister Costas Isychos, a close ally of Tsipras, who insisted the government was \u201cdetermined to stop this neo-liberal tsunami.\u201d \u201cWe will stay at our red lines, we will not go back on our pre-electoral agenda. We are not bluffing, this is not a poker game, we do not belong to the past we belong to the future and we are not going to go back on our promises.\u201d Isychos, who was raised in Canada, denied that Syriza was riven with disagreement saying hardliners on its far left would also endorse a deal - even if they were at odds with it. That chimes with what insiders have long said: that no one would dare take the step of triggering the collapse of Greece\u2019s first Leftist government. Echoing what is fast becoming a widely held view, Isychos said it had become ever more apparent that lenders were working with the aim of pushing the government to such a point (though reversal of its policies) that it eventually collapsed. \u201cThey want to tar Syriza with the brush of austerity and humiliate the prime minister so that the government collapses,\u201d he told me. \u201cThat is the strategy being pushed by Greek oligarchs who are in control of most of the private media and are in complete agreement with lenders.\u201d There is much excitement about Tsipras\u2019 address. What is he going to tell his own MPs at this very difficult time? This might send shivers through Berlin. German investor sentiment has fallen this month, as the Greek crisis hurts Europe\u2019s largest economy. The forward-looking Economic Conditions index, tracked by the ZEW Institute, fell to 31.5, down from 41.9. That\u2019s a \u201cpretty precipitous decline\u201d, says Bloomberg\u2019s Hans Nichols. And ZEW President Professor Clemens Fuest pins the blame firmly on Greece, saying: \u201cExternal factors are reducing the scope for further improvement of Germany\u2019s good economic situation. These include, in particular, the ongoing uncertainty over Greece\u2019s future and the restrained dynamic of the global economy.\u201d ZEW\u2019s measure of the current situation in the German economy also dipped, to 62.9 this month from 65.7 in May. And its Indicator of Economic Sentiment for the Eurozone slid by 7.5 points to a reading of 53.7 points. Here\u2019s the full report. There is chatter in Brussels today that EU leaders could hold an emergency summit this weekend, if there is no progress at Thursday\u2019s eurogroup meeting of finance chiefs. However, it\u2019s not clear that they would actually have much to get their teeth into -- as the FT\u2019s Peter Speigel reports: Eurozone officials are discussing holding an emergency summit on Sunday for leaders to tackle the crisis in Greece amid mounting fears a deal to break an ongoing impasse between Athens and its bailout creditors will not be reached at a high-stakes finance ministers meeting on Thursday. According to two senior officials, the idea of holding a summit of eurozone heads of government was mooted in meetings among representatives of Greece\u2019s creditors on Monday, a day after last-ditch negotiations to reach a deal to release \u20ac7.2bn in much-needed bailout aid collapsed. They said that although the idea was discussed, there is considerable resistance to convening the summit among several creditors since technocratic issues like Greek pension reforms and tax rates are not normally the province of EU presidents and prime ministers. \u201cIf there\u2019s nothing to discuss among finance ministers, there wouldn\u2019t be anything to discuss among heads,\u201d said one official from a Greek creditor institution. Die Welt\u2019s Jan Dams has also heard that a summit is on the cards.... Over in Athens officials appear to have drawn a line in the sand, saying it is now in the court of lenders to resume talks. Our correspondent Helena Smith reports: Senior government sources are ruling out any deal before the euro group - now aiming for to cut a deal towards the end of the month. Echoing what Greece\u2019s chief negotiator Euclid Tsakalotos told me yesterday, officials say they have \u201cno idea\u201d when stalled talks will now resume. What many are banking on is that creditors, led by Germany, will want to see movement - any kind at this point - before Thursday\u2019s meeting of euro group finance ministers. Officials appeared adamant this morning that Tsipras\u2019 leftist-led government will not be making any more proposals. With three proposals already submitted by Athens (the last outlining measures worth \u20ac5.5bn) Greece has reached the end of the road in what it can offer, they say. And that squares with Varoufakis\u2019s comments to Bild this morning, that he won\u2019t bring a new plan to Thursday\u2019s Eurogroup. Those comments are getting a lot of coverage in the Athens media today. Britain\u2019s brief flirtation with negative inflation is over. The Consumer Prices Index rose by 0.1% year-on-year in May, having dipped to -0.1% in April. Food prices continued to fall, down 1.8% year-on-year, while cheaper oil prices meant transport costs were 1.5% cheaper. But many other items cost more than a year ago - including alcohol (+2.2%), health (+2.2%), education (+10%) and restaurants (+1.9%). Despite pressure from Europe, there\u2019s no sign this morning that Greece is prepared to capitulate and agree to tougher austerity measures demanded by lenders. Indeed, finance minister Yanis Varoufakis has told the German Bild newspaper that he won\u2019t present a new reform plan at Thursday\u2019s eurogroup meeting. That\u2019s helping to drive today\u2019s selloff in the markets, given Mario Draghi\u2019s warning on Monday that a strong, comprehensive deal is needed ASAP. Asked if he would present such a list, Varoufakis replied: \u201cNo, because the Eurogroup (of euro zone finance ministers) is not the right place to present proposals which haven\u2019t been discussed and negotiated on a lower level before.\u201d And those lower-level talks remain frozen, after Greece\u2019s latest plan was dismissed as inadequate on Sunday night. The cost of insuring Spanish and Italian debt has risen this morning, in a further sign of jitteriness. The Greek stock market is feeling the pain too. The main ATG index fell by 1.5% at the start of trading, adding to yesterday\u2019s side of nearly 5%. Greek government bonds are weakening again this morning, driving up the yield (or interest rate) on its two-year bonds over 30%. That\u2019s a stomach-clenchingly high yield -- suggesting that the debt is rather unlikely to be repaid in full (yields rise when prices fall). The yield on 10-year Greek bonds has jumped too, from 12.7% to 13%. That also suggests alarm in the markets. Breaking news: The European Court of Justice has ruled that the ECB\u2019s bond-buying programme is legal. That\u2019s a win for President Draghi (We never doubted you, Mario), and a blow to critics in Germany who claimed the OMT programme breached European treaties and was effectively monetary financing. Fears that Greece is on the verge of default have hit Europe\u2019s stock markets in early trading, driving them down to their lowest levels since February. The main indices are all in the red, for the third day running, as concern grows that there will not be a breakthrough in time. The German Dax has shed another 71 points, or 0.6%, as investors digest those claims that EU leaders could bounce Greece into imposing capital controls this weekend. Connor Campbell, Financial Analyst at Spreadex, says the \u201cperpetual handwringing\u201d over Greece is hitting the markets. Signs of progress are few and far between, leaving the markets to continue the negative performance that has been a regular feature of trading in the past month. Each side is firmly entrenched in their belief that their proposal is the only feasible option\u2019 not the kind of atmosphere that is going to yield a solution, especially with the Eurogroup meeting only days away. Could Austria\u2019s chancellor, Werner Faymann, help break the deadlock? Faymann is travelling to Greece today, and Bloomberg has flagged up rumours that he could be carrying a \u2018compromise proposal\u2019 to discuss with prime minister Alexis Tsipras on Wednesday. It seems a little implausible. but still.....Faymann did tell the ANA news agency that Greece needs a five year plan to restore hope and prosperity. He pointed out: \u201cGreece constitutes a warning on what happens when one applies only austerity.\u201d The interest rates on Spanish and Italian government debt is jumping this morning, as the Greek crisis continues to spook the markets. The yield on 10-year Spanish bonds has popped by another 12 basis points to 2.5%, up from 2.38% last night. That\u2019s its highest rate in 10 months, meaning it will cost Madrid more to borrow money. That suggests Greece\u2019s deadlock is starting to send some shivers through the eurozone debt markets.... Another important news story to watch out for this morning \u2013 the European Court of Justice will rule whether one of the eurozone\u2019s financial crisis weapons is legal. The ECJ has been deliberating for months whether the Outright Monetary Transactions programme, created by Mario Draghi in the white heat of the 2012 debt crisis, is permitted under European law. OMT gives the ECB the ability to buy unlimited quantities of government bonds if a eurozone country suffers financing problems. That helped calm the crisis - would you go up Draghi in a financial arm-wrestling contest? Back in January, a court official issued a preliminary opinion saying the bond purchase offer was permitted under the basic European Union treaty. The judges don\u2019t have to follow preliminary opinions, but they probably will..... After yesterday\u2019s plunges, the European stock markets are likely to fall again this morning as investors nervously await developments. With 20 minutes to go, IG are predicting that the FTSE 100 and German DAX will both dip into the red again: As Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at OANDA, explains: \u201cNegotiations have hit rough patches on numerous occasions throughout this process but this is the first time that they appear to have totally collapsed,\u201d \u201cAt this stage it is difficult to see how this will be resolved without significant compromises being made, something both sides have absolutely no interest in.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the Greek bailout crisis and other key events across the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Greece and its creditors remain deadlocked this morning as the prospect of a default, and even a euro exit, continue to haunt the eurozone and stalk financial markets. Following the collapse of talks on Sunday night, both sides have now dug in - insisting that the other one needs to compromise before progress can be made. So we may face another day of rhetoric from both sides, ahead of Thursday\u2019s eurogroup meeting \u2013 perhaps the last chance to make progress before the end of June. Greece is nervously digesting last night\u2019s claim that capital controls could be imposed as soon as this weekend. Germany\u2019s S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung newspaper reported that EU leaders were drawing up an \u2018emergency plan\u2019 in case there was no deal by Friday. If that happened, they\u2019d force Greece to close its banks for a few days. Brussels insiders have denied that plan to us, but it is a reminder that this crisis could escalate over the days ahead..... Also coming up today... Compared to the crisis brewing in Greece, economic data is merely a sideshow. But we do find out this morning whether Britain\u2019s shop prices kept falling last month, whether the eurozone unemployment rate fell in the first quarter, and how optimistic German firms are feeling: 9:30am BST: UK Consumer Prices index for May 10am: Eurozone unemployment in Q1 2015 10am: German ZEW confidence reading I\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day",

It\u2019s an open question now that new Ofcom boss Sharon White has declared that Whistl\u2019s decision to pull its postmen off the streets requires a \u201cfundamental review\u201d of the regulation of Royal Mail. Whistl fulfilled the regulatory brief for a competitor to hold Royal Mail\u2019s feet to the fire in the interests of efficiency and modernisation. But Whistl ended up burning itself. It clocked up losses of \u00a310m despite placing its operatives only in densely populated cities, a tactic damned as \u201ccherry picking\u201d by Royal Mail chief executive Moya Greene. It seems highly unlikely that another company would wish to risk an adventure into the orchard. Whistl, after all, is owned by privatised Dutch outfit PostNL and knows the game. The moral of the tale may be very simple: the last mile of the postal network is a natural monopoly and having rival postmen tour the same streets makes no economic sense. That being so, Ofcom wants to mimic the effect of the competition it wishes existed. From Royal Mail\u2019s point of view, all the remedies could sound alarming. Freedom to set the price of a first class stamp, a key part of the liberalising 2012 reforms, could be removed. Ofcom might decide it needs to control Royal Mail\u2019s power in the wholesale market, meaning the prices it can charge collection and sorting rivals (including Whistl, which is staying in that part of the market) to access its network. Or maybe Ofcom could dictate formal cost-saving targets to Royal Mail. Investors didn\u2019t know what to think. Royal Mail\u2019s shares initially fell but ended the day up. The late recovery makes more sense. Whistl, had it kept going, could have become a serious headache for Royal Mail. Whatever Ofcom\u2019s review brings, it must be preferable for Royal Mail over the long term to plead for rational economic incentives in front of a regulator obliged to protect the universal service. Most of the time, the cure is not worse than the disease. Cleanup of the zombie banks UK Asset Resolution is one part of the great banking clean-up operation that has exceeded expectations. The job of the inelegantly-named outfit is to run off and sell the lending books of the remnants of Northern Rock and Bradford &amp; Bingley. Progress has been steady. Almost 30% of the government\u2019s loan has been repaid. The balance sheet has been shrunk by 43% since 2010. And there has been a notable absence of scandal around the treatment of borrowers in arrears. But there\u2019s an oddity in UKAR\u2019s numbers: it is still sitting on 106,000 unsecured personal loans, only 13,000 fewer than a year ago. Shouldn\u2019t the figure be zero by now? Unsecured loans tend to have much shorter lives than mortgages. Five years would be a long time. And, since UKAR was created in 2010, you\u2019d think the slate would be clear by now. The answer, of course, lies in Northern Rock\u2019s notorious 125% mortgages, which weren\u2019t exactly what they said. They tended to be 95% mortgages with an unsecured loan on top. And, crucially, the term of the loan could be identical to that of the mortgages. In other words, Northern Rock was making unsecured loans with a maturity of up to 35 years. That\u2019s why there are still 106,000 hanging around. The lending practice was utter madness, of course. Granting multi-decade unsecured personal loans is almost the definition of bad banking. Not for the first time, UK banking, circa 2005-07, seems like the wild west. Regulators, remember, smiled on those loans and Rock chairman Matt Ridley and chief executive Adam Applegarth saw nothing improper. Taxpayers, thankfully, have been spared vicious losses, in large part because interest rates have been at rock-bottom for half a decade. There may now even be buyers for some of those unsecured loans as part of the planned sale of Granite, Rock\u2019s securitisation vehicle. But we\u2019ve been lucky. Shares take flight at Lloyds Over at Lloyds Banking Group, where the state is a steady seller of shares, executives have caught the bug. Tuesday brought forth another bundle of sales by the senior management. Three executives sold a combined total of 4.9m shares, banking \u00a34.2m. Four others shared \u00a36.3m the day before. The sales, note, are not related to the need to meet tax bills after the vesting of share options. They are straightforward sales where the individual has a free hand. All the executives still have the required personal holdings (naturally) and the regulatory window for such disposals is always brief. All the same, \u00a310.5m of sales from Lloyds\u2019 sub-boardroom crew is a lot.",

And, since UKAR was created in 2010, you\u2019d think the slate would be clear by now.</p> <p>The answer, of course, lies in Northern Rock\u2019s notorious 125% mortgages, which weren\u2019t exactly what they said. They tended to be 95% mortgages with an unsecured loan on top. And, crucially, the term of the loan could be identical to that of the mortgages. In other words, Northern Rock was making unsecured loans with a maturity of up to 35 years.</p> <p>That\u2019s why there are still 106,000 hanging around.</p> <p>The lending practice was utter madness, of course. Granting multi-decade unsecured personal loans is almost the definition of bad banking. Not for the first time, UK banking, circa 2005-07, seems like the wild west. Regulators, remember, smiled on those loans and Rock chairman Matt Ridley and chief executive Adam Applegarth saw nothing improper.</p> <p>Taxpayers, thankfully, have been spared vicious losses, in large part because interest rates have been at rock-bottom for half a decade. There may now even be buyers for some of those unsecured loans as part of the planned sale of Granite, Rock\u2019s securitisation vehicle. But we\u2019ve been lucky.</p> <h2>Shares take flight at Lloyds</h2> <p>Over at Lloyds Banking Group, where the state is a steady seller of shares, executives have caught the bug. Tuesday brought forth another bundle of sales by the senior management. Three executives sold a combined total of 4.9m shares, banking \u00a34.2m. Four others shared \u00a36.3m the day before.</p> <p>The sales, note, are not related to the need to meet tax bills after the vesting of share options. They are straightforward sales where the individual has a free hand. All the executives still have the required personal holdings (naturally) and the regulatory window for such disposals is always brief. All the same, \u00a310.5m of sales from Lloyds\u2019 sub-boardroom crew is a lot.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Officials in Brussels will on Wednesday announce a series of measures designed to stamp out the toxic culture of secret, sweetheart tax deals for multinationals which prevails in a handful of EU member states and erodes tax receipts in other countries. Among the expected measures is an official blacklist of 30 tax havens, a register of the worst-offending jurisdictions identified by all member states. It is expected to include many frequently cited offshore jurisdictions as well as some surprise additions and omissions. Pierre Moscovici, the European commissioner for tax, will also announce a consultation on the extent to which big corporations\u2019 most controversial tax arrangements should be made public \u2014 a key demand of many campaign groups. This move would include forcing country-by-country disclosures of business activities, as well as potentially insisting multinationals publish details of the bespoke rulings they have secured from individual tax authorities. In March the European commission set out plans to force member states\u2019 tax offices to share such tax rulings with one another privately to help combat avoidance. Campaigners want such arrangements \u2014 through which multinationals receive comfort about the tax treatment of their most controversial affairs \u2014 to be public. Corporate interests are expected to lobby hard against this level of transparency. At the heart of European commission proposals on Wednesday will be an outline of rules to standardise the way multinationals\u2019 taxable profits are apportioned between countries \u2014 a framework referred to in tax jargon as the \u201ccommon consolidated corporate tax base\u201d, or CCCTB. Despite being widely backed by tax policy technicians, however, CCCTB \u2014 an idea first put forward four years ago \u2014 remains politically incendiary because it is a harmonisation measure. As such, it is an anathema to Eurosceptics in the UK and elsewhere. At present, the rules determining where multinationals\u2019 taxable profits arise across Europe are found in a bewildering maze of bilateral tax treaties between EU member states. This treaty network is failing woefully, unable to cope with the toxic mix of ever more aggressive corporate tax planning and increasingly accommodating member states using tax policy to compete for inward investment. Last year the LuxLeaks scandal exposed the industrial scale on which Luxembourg was awarding confidential tax rulings to some of the world\u2019s largest corporations, effectively rubber-stamping structures designed to artificially depress groups\u2019 tax bills in other countries. Hundreds of companies saw their European tax antics exposed, including Skype, financial trading house Icap and drugs firm Shire. In its defence, Luxembourg quickly pointed the finger at other jurisdictions \u2014 Belgium and Ireland among them \u2014 claiming they too offered attractive but confidential tax rulings in an effort to lure inward investment. Acknowledging as much, the commission in March admitted some member states had \u201ccontributed to, and encouraged, aggressive tax planning\u201d. Last year the commission launched a series of competition probes into some of the highest-profile tax rulings offered by member states. Ongoing investigations are examining whether certain rulings \u2014 including those offered by Ireland to Apple, Luxembourg to Amazon and the Netherlands to Starbucks \u2014 were so generous as to constitute illegal state aid. Last month Treasury minister David Gauke appeared to get his rebuff to Moscovici in early, telling the FT: \u201cThe CCCTB has been around a very long time. It is a proposal still looking for a justification.\u201d The commission wants to push through CCCTB next year, but it is aware of likely opposition from countries such as Ireland and the UK. In order to make the proposal more politically palatable, Brussels is expected to suggest that that the \u201cconsolidated\u201d element of the proposal be delayed in the hope this will kill accusations of a Brussels power-grab. That would allow the officials to focus first on agreeing on a common methodology for apportioning taxable profits. Only later \u2014 and if there is the political appetite \u2014 would the commission look at a second phase, introducing single European tax returns for multinationals. Commission officials are expected to emphasise that CCCTB, which is strongly supported by France and Germany, is designed to override many aspects of existing tax treaties and make for more effective taxation across the EU. They will stress it is in no way an attempt by Brussels to impose restrictions on member states\u2019 sovereign powers to set tax rates.",

      "bodyText": "Fears that the five-year Greek financial crisis will culminate in debt default and exit from the euro have intensified as Athens hardened its rhetoric against its creditors and insisted it would miss a payment to the International Monetary Fund unless it received debt relief. With just 48 hours to go before a meeting of eurozone finance ministers, seen as the last realistic chance to reach a deal before Greece has to pay the IMF at the end of June, Alexis Tsipras, showed no sign of bowing to demands for cuts in pensions and increases in VAT. Instead, the Greek prime minister accused the Fund of \u201ccriminal responsibility\u201d for the situation and said lenders were seeking to \u201chumiliate\u201d his country. Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European commission, reflected the anger in Brussels at the way Tsipras has been approaching the deadlocked negotiations by saying he had \u201csympathy for the Greek people but not the Greek government\u201d. Juncker was until recently rated as one of Tsipras\u2019s only allies. EU officials were on Tuesday night making preparations for a crisis meeting of leaders on Sunday if, as now expected, the talks between finance ministers on Thursday prove fruitless. Amid the third straight day of sharp declines on the Athens stock market, EU leaders are for the first time talking openly about Greek default and its ejection from the euro. Valdis Dombrovskis, vice-president of the commission, said eurozone leaders were discussing \u201cless favourable scenarios\u201d for Greece, while the Finnish prime minister, Juha Sipil\u00e4, said an agreement with Greece now would require a miracle. Away from Greece, financial markets had a relatively calm day, suggesting that they have already \u201cpriced in\u201d the risk of a Greek default \u2013 or still believe a last-minute deal will be struck in Luxembourg. Speaking in the Greek parliament, Tsipras called on creditors to reassess the IMF\u2019s insistence on tough cuts as part of the country\u2019s bailout. \u201cThe time has come for the IMF\u2019s proposals to be judged not just by us but especially by Europe,\u201d he said. \u201cRight now, what dominates is the IMF\u2019s harsh views on tough measures, and Europe\u2019s on denying any discussion over debt viability. The fixation on cuts ... is most likely part of a political plan ... to humiliate an entire people that has suffered in the past five years through no fault of its own.\u201d Earlier, it emerged Greece was threatening to miss the 30 June deadline to make a \u20ac1.6bn (\u00a31.15bn) debt repayment to the IMF this month, after previously bundling up four separate scheduled June payments into one. \u201cThe government will not pay the IMF, if by the end of the month an agreement hasn\u2019t been achieved with lenders,\u201d Tsipras is reported to have told the opposition party leader, Stavros Theodorakis, during talks between the two in Athens today. Some observers in Greece said that Tsipras was holding out the prospect of a compromise in which he would deliver some of the reforms sought by the troika of the IMF, the European Central Bank and the European commission in return for debt relief. The IMF believes that debt relief is part of a long-term solution to Greece\u2019s problems. But with the relationship between Greece and its partners at its lowest ebb since Tsipras became prime minister five months ago, the eurozone and the commission said they will only negotiate if Greece tables serious new proposals on fiscal targets, including pensions reforms and liberalisation of the labour market. Yanis Varoufakis, the Greek finance minister, said he would not take any new proposals to Luxembourg and challenged the legitimacy of the negotiations. Speaking to Germany\u2019s Spiegel newspaper, Varoufakis said the proposals for spending cuts and reforms were already so harsh and brutal the Germans themselves would never accept them. He said: \u201cGreece will only commit to them if Europe agrees to a debt restructuring, investments and an end to the liquidity crisis.\u201d Asked if an agreement would be reached this weekend he said: \u201cAsk Merkel.\u201d There is an EU summit in Brussels on Thursday and Friday next week. The summit has to grapple with major issues such as David Cameron\u2019s in/out referendum on the EU, sanctions on Russia, and the Mediterranean refugee emergency. Leaders, especially Merkel, do not want next week\u2019s summit hijacked by Greece. But that appears inevitable without a breakthrough. Refusing to pay the IMF would not formally put Greece in default on its huge government debts \u2013 since the IMF is not a commercial lender \u2013 but it would represent a big step towards that eventuality and open the question as to whether Greece, without an agreement with the eurozone, will be able to redeem more than \u20ac3bn of bonds at the European Central Bank next month. Without agreement extending the rescue package and freeing up to \u20ac19bn in bailout funds tied to Greek reforms, Athens will run out of cash. The German tabloid Bild reported that the Greek government had discovered a way of deferring the IMF payment until the end of the year. Greek officials denied the report.",

The German tabloid Bild reported that the Greek government had discovered a way of deferring the IMF payment until the end of the year. Greek officials denied the report.</p>",

    "webTitle": "More than 130,000 Northern Rock mortgages owned by zombie bank", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Around 130,000 customers of Northern Rock will find out in the coming months that the mortgage they have with the Newcastle-based lender, which was nationalised in 2008, is now owned by somebody else. The borrowers will receive notification from the zombie bank, which took over the parts of Northern Rock rescued by taxpayers, that their home loans have been sold off as part of an attempt to help repay a loan from the Treasury. It will be the moment that those 131,000 customers realise their mortgages were used to fund Granite, a complex financing vehicle that Northern Rock used to raise \u00a350bn on the financial markets \u2013 to fund its mortgage lending before the credit crunch. At its peak, Granite was the biggest financing vehicle of its kind in Europe. Northern Rock sold mortgages to Granite, and Granite paid for them by selling bonds to investors. It should have been a virtuous circle but when investor appetite for those bonds evaporated, the bank had a very public funding crisis. Customers queued to withdraw their cash: the first run on a bank in more than century. But what was once a huge problem is now a huge asset: George Osborne is hoping that by selling off Granite, it will help him bring down the nation\u2019s net debt by \u00a313bn and return more money to the taxpayer. It is understood that there are several would-be buyers for Granite: among them a consortium including Goldman Sachs and Blackstone and Royal Bank of Scotland, which like Northern Rock was rescued by taxpayers during the banking crisis. The bad bank, known as UK Asset Resolution, has already paid back 30% of the \u00a349bn loans that were granted to keep Northern Rock (and Bradford &amp; Bingley) afloat. Those repayments come from mortgage payments and remortgages, when customers move their loans elsewhere. UKAR \u2013 which currently has 389,000 mortgage and loan customers inherited from Northern Rock and B&amp;B \u2013 announced on Tuesday that it had repaid another \u00a33.7bn in its financial year, taking the total to more than \u00a314bn, and was on course to repay another \u00a35bn by selling off Granite. The sale is part of the UKAR restructuring that the chancellor signalled in his March budget. The mortgage processing arm is also up for sale, a move that will cut the UKAR workforce to 200, from 2,100. Richard Banks, UKAR\u2019s chief executive who was paid \u00a3653,277 last year, said: \u201cThese two programmes are our most ambitious initiatives to date and the work on these over the next twelve months will determine the next stage in our future\u201d. UKAR inherited other problems. In its latest update, it has set aside \u00a3295m for compensation for missold loans, including \u00a333m to cover claims for payment protection insurance misselling. Selling off mortgage books is not new. UKAR sold off a \u00a32.7bn mortgage book last year and has also sold mortgages to Virgin Money, which bought the \u201cgood\u201d part of Northern Rock. But Granite is more complex, UKAR said. The vast majority (92%) of the loans buried inside Granite are variable-rate mortgages and Northern Rock\u2019s infamous Together mortgages , which allowed customers to borrow 125% of the value of the home they intended to buy. The idea was that house prices would rise and the borrower would not be left with debts greater than the value of their house. Immediately after the financial crisis, as house prices went into reverse, the Together loans looked like a prime example of reckless lending, but house prices have since bounced back and only 2% of the borrowers are in negative equity. That negative equity figure, however, masks the fact that the personal loans sold alongside mortgages to make up the Together product are not included. Around 50,000 personal loans \u2013 which last as long the home loans attached \u2013 are part of the Granite sale. Some \u00a31bn of loans are in arrears. The attractions of buying bundles of mortgages may not be immediately obvious. But for a bank already in the home-loans business, adding in \u00a313bn of extra mortgages would help improve the cost-income ratio \u2013 a closely watched measure of efficiency. For a private equity bidder, the book of loans could prove attractive because of the return on the bonds at a time when interest rates are stuck at historic lows of 0.5%. The margin on the loans is over 4%. While the sale process continues, Banks is focusing on customers whose family finances could be knocked off course by rising interest rates \u2013 which could come next year. A quarter-point rate rise will add \u00a320 a month to average mortgage payments and, he said: \u201cThere are a number of customers who are quite fragile.\u201d The sale of Granite comes as Osborne prepares to sell off other banks rescued during the crisis. An offer of shares in Lloyds Banking Group to small investors is being prepared and the first tranche of the government\u2019s 79% stake in Royal Bank of Scotland readied for sale. For Northern Rock and Bradford &amp; Bingley to repay their debts will likely take a lot longer. Their repayments come only as customers repay loans \u2013 and the longest mortgage in UKAR\u2019s portfolio runs to 2049.",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s brief flirtation with negative inflation ended last month, with official figures showing that prices rose again in May helped by higher air fares and petrol prices. The Office for National Statistics said its consumer price index measure of inflation was up 0.1% on last year after a 0.1% dip in April \u2013 the first negative inflation for more than 50 years. May\u2019s uptick marked the first rise in the inflation rate since October. But economists said inflationary pressures remained benign with oil prices lower than a year ago and food prices held down by an ongoing supermarket price war. Most expect inflation to stay low over coming months, putting little pressure on the Bank of England to start raising interest rates from their record low of 0.5%. \u201cThe big picture is of very weak price pressures. Inflation is unlikely to rise significantly above the zero mark for the rest this year,\u201d said Ian Stewart, chief economist at consultants Deloitte. \u201cWith inflation likely to stay below its 2.0% target until 2017, the Bank of England can afford to take its time before raising interest rates. UK consumers will continue to benefit from very weak price pressures and ultra-low interest for some time yet.\u201d First rise for seven months The ONS said the main upward pressures on inflation last month came from air fares, which rose this May but fell a year ago. Airline tickets had been a significant drag on inflation when it turned negative in April, with the early timing of Easter this year cited as a likely factor. There was also upward pressure on inflation last month from fuel prices as petrol rose by 2.5p a litre and diesel by 1.5p from the month before. Food prices also played a role, given they fell just 0.1% this May compared with a much deeper decline of 1.1% a year earlier. There was also downward pressure from cheaper toys and computer games. The ONS said there was also a slight pickup in core inflation, which excludes the more volatile prices of energy, food, alcohol and tobacco. It rose to 0.9% from 0.8% in April. Core inflation was still surprisingly weak, said Martin Beck, senior economic advisor to the forecasting group EY ITEM Club. \u201cIt is difficult to see any reason why inflation will deviate far from zero in the next few months. If anything, there is a good chance that the CPI measure will briefly turn negative again during the summer,\u201d said Beck. Responding to the latest figures, George Osborne sought to highlight the boost to household finances from the combination of low prices and rising wages, which comes after years of pay falling in real terms. \u201cThis is good news for working people and family budgets, and shows the economic recovery is going from strength to strength. Of course the job is not done and we will continue to remain vigilant to all risks, particularly when the global economic situation is so uncertain,\u201d the chancellor said in a statement. The trades union body, the TUC, said while low prices were a relief for households, they also indicated underlying weaknesses in the UK economy. \u201cWhile the downward pressure on prices is in part from exceptional international circumstances, inflation so far below target also shows that the strength and stability of the recovery can\u2019t be taken for granted,\u201d said the TUC general secretary, Frances O\u2019Grady. \u201cThe fundamental problems with the economy have not yet been fixed, and the extreme cuts the chancellor is planning in next month\u2019s budget will only make a lasting recovery harder to achieve.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "While the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, is publicly insistent on reaching a compromise deal that ensures Greece is saved from insolvency, expectation is rising \u2013 in Germany and elsewhere \u2013 of a Greek exit from the eurozone. With just two weeks to go for Athens to find a solution to creditors\u2019 cash-for-reforms demands for a 1.6 bn euro repayment to the International Monetary Fund, a Greek default \u2013 and a Grexit with it \u2013 are viewed in Berlin as ever more likely. But the geo-political fallout from such a scenario is considered so potentially catastrophic that many believe the German government, under Merkel\u2019s guidance, will do anything to try to avoid it. \u201cMerkel is facing one of the most difficult decisions of her chancellorship,\u201d according to the latest edition of German news magazine Der Spiegel. \u201cThe question is whether Greece is allowed to stay in the euro or whether Merkel will end the drama with a nasty surprise \u2013 a Grexit. She wants to keep Greece in the euro, albeit not unconditionally, but she is prepared to pay a high price for it.\u201d Merkel\u2019s commitment to save Greece was expressed last week in her insistent phrase: \u201cWhere there\u2019s a will, there\u2019s a way\u201d. It would appear to be her one-size-fits-all idiom for the crisis \u2013 she also uttered it when discussing Brexit during David Cameron\u2019s Berlin visit two weeks ago. But with signs of a deal with Greece being further out of reach than ever, of a growing rift between her and her finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, (he is said to believe a Grexit is the lesser of two evils), and of deep divisions within her own CDU/CSU, Merkel could find herself increasingly isolated on the issue. With his repeated declarations that Germany, above any other country, carries responsibility for ensuring Europe stays whole, Greece\u2019s finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, knows he is touching a nerve with most Germans, including Merkel, who feel their responsibility towards Europe only too keenly as a result of the country\u2019s Nazi past. Merkel also fears that, due to the current instability in the Balkans and Ukraine, and with Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin \u2013 and even China \u2013 seeming to have a foot in the door in case of a Greek default, turning away from Greece now is not an option. While opinion is divided over how to deal with the Greek government, editorials in Germany\u2019s papers on Tuesday all agreed that the drama has run on for far too long. \u201cIf the German debt row was a theatre production, the audience would have long since made a frustrated escape from the auditorium,\u201d wrote the leftwing Tageszeitung. \u201cThe constant repetition of supposed dramatic high points, in which the talk is regularly of a \u2018last chance\u2019, appear unrealistic and staged. But this is not a piece of theatre. It\u2019s about the future of millions of people ... about whether the Greeks will have any money left to buy medicine, whether unemployment rises in Germany as a result, and whether Europe stays intact or falls apart.\u201d The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, while bemoaning the manner in which the Greek government of Alexis Tsipras has approached the negotiations, argued that democracy in the whole of Europe was at stake over the crisis. \u201cAlthough their readiness to adhere to a reform plan is extremely low and although their cold grinning self-righteousness is unbearable, there\u2019s no way this can continue. This is not about humiliating a people and its government. It\u2019s far more to do with their ideologically motivated denial of reality,\u201d said the conservative daily. While some economists are convinced that, as in past crises, a last-minute deal will be found to avoid insolvency, increasing numbers of politicians in Merkel\u2019s own ranks are more determined than ever before to make Greece stick to the creditors\u2019 demands. \u201cIt won\u2019t work that Greece sets the terms and says \u2018everyone has to dance to our tune\u2019. Greece needs to get back to reality,\u201d Volker Kauder, the parliamentary floor leader of Merkel\u2019s CDU told German television. But Claudia Roth, vice-president of the Bundestag, and a leading member of the Greens, said while she was exasperated by the failure of negotiations so far, it was the fate of the people of Greece and the future of Europe that were most at stake if Greece were allowed to default. \u201cOf course one has the feeling that the Greek government is playing about, but this is about the people of Greece. It\u2019s about the further impoverishment of Greece, and about Project Europe, and this the negotiating sides need to have in their sights,\u201d she told German radio. Roth added that a Grexit would have incalculable consequences for other strained economies. \u201cFor Italy and Spain it would prompt a downward spiral, it would unleash speculations about the euro, it would have unclear consequences for the global financial system, an incalculable risk for the world economy and as well as that, a Grexit would be far more expensive for Germany at the end than rescuing Greece now,\u201d she said. At the same time others, have accused Tsipras of causing huge tensions in Europe by failing to see that Greece\u2019s main critics are beyond Germany. \u201cHis mistake is to have declared Germany to be his main opponent, even though the biggest critics are elsewhere,\u201d wrote Michael Sauga in Der Spiegel, \u201csuch as Portugal, which dealt with similarly serious reforms without huge protest. Or in Slovakia, a country in which the average income is lower than that of Greece.\u201d Merkel has never yet been pinned down on what she eventually wants the legacy of her chancellorship to be. But the woman who back in 2010 first used the phrase \u201cif the euro fails, Europe fails\u201d knows that a Grexit under her watch would form more than just a footnote in any summary of her leadership. That is likely something she would wish to avoid. \u201cThe Greek prime minister is certainly playing with fire,\u201d said Thorsten M\u00fcller , a political studies student selling tickets for entry to a park in Potsdam, a city 22 miles to the south-west of Berlin. \u201cIn the end it will be the Greek government and a bunch of bankers who decides how this ends, depending on how they behave. Does that scare me? Yes, it does. I\u2019d like to see a bit more political leadership, rather than have the feeling that the future of Europe is in the hands of a bunch of creditors, bankers and leftwing chancers.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The organisers of an anti-austerity demonstration planned for the City of London this weekend have accused three of the four Labour leadership contenders of timidity for deciding to stay away. The End Austerity Now rally, organised by the People\u2019s Assembly, is expected to be the biggest anti-government demonstration for four years; tens of thousands of people will march from the City of London to Parliament Square. The leftwinger and Labour leadership hopeful Jeremy Corbyn is to make a keynote address, but the party\u2019s other contenders \u2013 Andy Burnham, Yvette Cooper and Liz Kendall \u2013 have indicated they do not plan to attend. Union leaders, including Len McClusky from the Unite union, the Labour party\u2019s biggest financial backers, will also be among the speakers. Sam Fairbairn, national secretary of the People\u2019s Assembly \u2013 the umbrella group of activists behind the march \u2013 said Burham, Cooper and Kendall had failed to grasp the level of public anger at budget cuts. He said: \u201cWe don\u2019t want to get involved in internal Labour debates, but its definitely timid of them not to show up. \u201cThis is why Labour lost the election, because they didn\u2019t take a hard enough line against austerity. Contrary to what the Blairites are saying about [former Labour leader Ed] Miliband being too leftwing, I think the opposite really.\u201d He speculated that Burnham, Cooper and Kendall did not want to be accused of double standards, having signed up to Labour\u2019s pre-election budget responsibility lock to eliminate the budget deficit. \u201cFrom their own point of view it might sound very hypocritical to attend a rally calling for no cuts when they have signed up to austerity.

The company, which rents out everything from small tools to large excavation equipment, reported a rise in full year profits from \u00a3362m to \u00a3490m, benefiting from positive construction markets on both sides of the Atlantic. It was also positive on the outlook. But with a spate of profit taking its shares are down 17p at \u00a311.10. Analysts remain positive. Andrew Nussey at Peel Hunt said: Growth momentum [is] continuing with underlying (constant currency) fourth quarter profits up 42% despite tough comp. Net debt \u00a31,687m gives return on investment of 19% despite significant fleet expansion. Outlook remains positive with momentum into the first quarter. Modest forecast upgrades: April 2016 by 2% to \u00a3610m. Shares are trading on upgraded PE of 15 times to Apil 2016 and whilst some may have been expecting larger upgrades, we note it is still early in the year. With clear momentum we reiterate our buy. Investec also issued a buy note: The group has yet again delivered results ahead of expectations, with pre-tax profit up 35% to a record \u00a3490m. There appear to be no signs of any slowdown in the US and this is reflected in the confirmation that it will again invest some \u00a31bn in capex during 2016. We continue to see the trajectory of recovery as more sustainable than in previous cycles and this should ensure earnings momentum remains strong for some time yet. In our view, the current rating is not prohibitive. Elswhere Ladbrokes is leading the FTSE 250 higher, up 3p at 120p after an upgrade from Morgan Stanley. The bank said: New chief executive Jim Mullen will outline his plans for Ladbrokes on June 30. We see scope for forecast upgrades for the first time in years, both Digital and Retail have significant catchup potential, Europe could be a hidden gem, cash earnings exceeds earnings per share, and the valuation is cheap. We upgrade to overweight. But property companies were mixed after a series of Goldman Sachs recommendations. Foxtons has fallen 6p to 248o.6p as the bank moved from neutral to sell, based on its premium valuation compared to its peers. Crest Nicholson is down 10.5p at 534p after Goldman reduced its recommendation from buy to neutral. But Barratt Developments is 3.5p better at 599.5p as Goldman lifted its target price from 517p to 605p. Lower down the market APR Energy has blown a fuse, down 92.5p or 26.5% at 256p after the temporary power supply company said full year results were likely to be significantly below expectations. It blamed the costs of moving out of Libya and delayed contract negotiations. Flowgroup, the efficient energy equipment supplier, has fallen 8.75p to 18.25p as it warned of a substantial reduction in the number of boilers it expected to install in 2015. The European Court of Justice ruled earlier this month that the UK\u2019s reduced VAT rate of 5% on energy-saving products was in breach of EU laws. VAT is now expected to be applied on its products at 20%, and it plans to accelerate its cost cutting programme.

      "bodyText": "Royal Mail could be made to accept further controls on stamp prices as part of an inquiry announced by the communications watchdog. Ofcom said it would carry out a \u201cfundamental review\u201d of how it regulates Royal Mail to make sure the company maintains its obligation to deliver to all parts of the country. The regulator decided to undertake the review after Whistl, Royal Mail\u2019s only national competitor for direct delivery of letters, pulled out of the market. Whistl, formerly known as TNT and owned by Dutch private postal group PostNL, suspended deliveries last month and withdrew permanently from the market on 10 June. It had planned to expand beyond its existing network in west London, Liverpool and Manchester to deliver to a quarter of the UK. Ofcom said it was concerned that without competition for letter delivery, Royal Mail might fail to make itself more efficient, threatening the universal postal service in the long run. One of the options is to introduce additional controls on the prices Royal Mail charges for its service. After Ofcom gave it greater commercial freedom in 2012, Royal Mail increased the price of first- and second-class stamps by 14p to 60p and 50p respectively. Prices rose to 63p for first class and 54p for second class in March. The price of second-class stamps is capped at 55p until 2020 with increases linked to inflation but there is no cap on first-class stamps. There are also limits on the charges Royal Mail makes for competitors to use its network. Both retail and wholesale charges are part of the review. Ofcom had given Royal Mail greater freedom to help support the fixed-price universal postal service but it is now stronger financially and operates as a public company after the government sold most of its stake in 2013. Royal Mail shares fell 1% to 500p in afternoon trading. Ofcom said: \u201cThe review will ensure regulation remains appropriate and sufficient to secure the universal postal service, given the recent withdrawal by Whistl from the \u2018direct delivery\u2019 letters market, which has resulted in Royal Mail no longer being subject to national competition. \u201cOfcom will consider ... whether Royal Mail\u2019s wholesale and retail prices are both affordable and sufficient to cover the costs of the universal service and whether Royal Mail\u2019s commercial flexibility remains appropriate in the changing market. And, if not, whether wholesale or retail charge controls might be appropriate.\u201d David Kerstens, an analyst at the stockbroker Jefferies, said further curbs on Royal Mail\u2019s charges could make the company less profitable as people post fewer letters. He said: \u201cStamp prices [in the UK] are at the low end of the spectrum compared with other countries across Europe. A control on pricing would be negative [for Royal Mail] because they won\u2019t be able to offset volume pressure to the same extent that some of their peers in Europe are able to do.\u201d Royal Mail is relying on increases in parcel delivery from online shopping to offset letters\u2019 decline but it faces tougher competition in the parcel market. Ofcom said its review would take in an existing examination of Royal Mail\u2019s efficiency and the prices it charges competitors for delivery to the door. Royal Mail and Whistl had been in a legal battle over what Royal Mail said was Whistl\u2019s \u201ccherry picking\u201d of profitable deliveries in densely populated cities. Whistl accused Royal Mail of predatory practice by threatening higher prices for letters it delivered for Whistl. Kerstens said it looked as though Ofcom was caught unawares when Whistl quit the market and that it now needed to find other ways to drive efficiency at Royal Mail. \u201cThe fact that Whistl pulled out must have come as a surprise, which is why Ofcom made reference to potential price controls.\u201d Royal Mail said there was plenty of competition for delivering parcels but that the market for letters was in structural decline. \u201cThere is therefore a need for regulatory clarity and certainty for all market participants,\u201d it said. Dave Ward, general secretary of the Communication Workers Union, accused Ofcom of interfering with its members\u2019 relations with Royal Mail. He said: \u201cRoyal Mail is efficient and postal workers are some of the most productive in the UK. Ofcom has overstepped its remit in criticising terms and conditions and a regulator should not be using efficiency to drive down employment standards.\u201d Ofcom said it would set out its initial thoughts and seek the views of interested parties next month. It will complete the review next year. \u2022 This article was amended on 17 June 2015. An earlier version said the cost of first- and second-class stamps rose by 14p to 50p and 40p respectively in 2012. In fact they rose to 60p and 50p respectively.",

Ofcom said its review would take in an existing examination of Royal Mail\u2019s efficiency and the prices it charges competitors for delivery to the door.</p> <p>Royal Mail and Whistl had been in a legal battle over what Royal Mail said was Whistl\u2019s \u201ccherry picking\u201d of profitable deliveries in densely populated cities. Whistl accused Royal Mail of predatory practice by threatening higher prices for letters it delivered for Whistl. </p> <p>Kerstens said it looked as though Ofcom was caught unawares when Whistl quit the market and that it now needed to find other ways to drive efficiency at Royal Mail. \u201cThe fact that Whistl pulled out must have come as a surprise, which is why Ofcom made reference to potential price controls.\u201d</p> <p>Royal Mail said there was plenty of competition for delivering parcels but that the market for letters was in structural decline. \u201cThere is therefore a need for regulatory clarity and certainty for all market participants,\u201d it said.<br></p> <p>Dave Ward, general secretary of the Communication Workers Union, accused Ofcom of interfering with its members\u2019 relations with Royal Mail. He said: \u201cRoyal Mail is efficient and postal workers are some of the most productive in the UK. Ofcom has overstepped its remit in criticising terms and conditions and a regulator should not be using efficiency to drive down employment standards.\u201d</p> <p>Ofcom said it would set out its initial thoughts and seek the views of interested parties next month. It will complete the review next year.<br></p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 17 June 2015. An earlier version said the cost of first- and second-class stamps rose by 14p to 50p and 40p respectively in 2012. In fact they rose to 60p and 50p respectively.</p>",
